&gt; &gt; That is a good point Bob.. some heads have the step cast into them,, some

&gt;
&gt; Don't put ANYTHING between the head and the barrel. Anything you put
&gt; there weakens the seal. Which is why VW themselves recommended a
&gt; direct head to cylinder fitting.

CATCH 22

  VW says don't use em, but the rebuilders make em so they are needed.

I just went thru this with AVP, installed the heads without gaskets but
the heads wouldn't seal, AVP says that they are required with their heads,
even sent me some....

pays yer money takes your chances,  measure your new heads before
installing.
