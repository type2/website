Subject: Carb Flooding

I checked the archives and didn't find much. I have a stock '71 1600 DP with
34PICT carb. Also I have a rotary electric fuel pump with ignition triggered
relay.

When I shut of the engine for a while, several minutes to several hours, and
try to restart the engine is badly flooded (several minutes of cranking with
the throttle wide open before it slowly sputters to life). It only happens
on warm or hot days and after the engine is hot. I know it's definitely
flooded and not vapor locked.

This happened on my last bus also which had one of those noisy solid state
pulse type pumps so it doesn't appear directly related to the type of fuel
pump.

The rotary pump on this bus is not a positive displacement type so there is
no residual fuel pressure after the engine is shut off. So maybe I can rule
out a bad needle and seat?

Sometimes it will stop doing this for several days which only reminds how
easy it supposed to start but always acts up again later.

About the only things common between the last bus and the current one are
the non-stock fuel pumps and the type of carburetor (and I guess, me).

Today I pulled the fuel pump relay before I stopped the engine and let the
carburetor empty before shutting off the engine. I went back several hours
later and it started fine. I need to try that some more, my thinking was
that somehow the fuel was just draining out of the carb, maybe something
like a jet loose?

I'm wondering if there is some common knowledge I am missing about the
problem. In addition to wear and tear on my battery and starter, I'm getting
my rebuild back next week and don't want all this raw gas flushing through
the engine washing the oil off the cylinder walls and probably even getting
in the oil.
