Subject: JRMC III

Hello everyone!!

 Just a short reminder to everyone of the Josh Rodgers Memorial Campout
(JRMC III) coming soon, Sept. 21-23, 2001.

 We are holding it at the Turner Falls Campgrounds, Davis, OK. This is
located on I-35 in south central Oklahoma. This year, we are moving it back
on top of the hill due to the anticipated increase of people attending. When
you arrive at the gate, be sure to tell them that you are with the Josh
Rodgers Group to get the group discount for the entry fees. Cost is $ 5 per
person per car, more if you want electric hook up.

Directions:
From OKC and points north: Go I-35 south to Exit 51, go south on US 77,
entrance on your right about 1 1/2 miles.

From Dallas and points south: Go I-35 north to exit 47, tun left onto US 77,
entrance on your left about 3 miles.

Hope to see you there!!!
