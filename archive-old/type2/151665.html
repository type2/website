Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Sherwin,

I know it probably doesn't seem like it to you, but it's not rocket 
science&lt;grin&gt;.  Since you have a complete kit, it should be relatively 
easy.  

Of course, you are correct, with the cutout templates for the fan shroud, 
engine tin and inside floor missing, it will be a little 
tougher...especially since it sounds like you have never seen one 
installed?

The hole that needs to be cut thru the floor behind the drivers seat will 
be easy because it will be based on the position of the black plastic 
cover that runs down the side of the wall next to the window.  You also 
have a piece of foam included in the kit that will give you a good idea 
about the size of the hole...be warned, it will not compress well and will 
leave gaps.  You will need to buy some of the black mastic &quot;pookey&quot; stuff 
that comes in 25 foot flat rolls.

The engine tin cutouts will be more difficult since I don't know anyone 
that still has their T1 engine mount and compressor installed.

Basically, the hard part about A/C is to get the evaporator and condensor 
coils matched and to get the expansion valve(in the overhead unit) sized 
correctly....as well as to maximize the flow thru the unit.

I would strongly suggest that you consider a rotary compressor instead of 
the York, but that is up to you....and adds a fair amount of expense to 
your present kit.

Surely by now, you have seen the VPC underdash instructions on Richards 
page.  All of the wiring and hoses will run down the drivers side frame 
rail on your unit instead of as shown in the instructions.


Pictures for sure later today.

As I said earlier, lay everything out on the floor and match hoses and the 
receiver dryer and wiring.

BTW, the hoses in my kit were in perfect shape and still look great.

WARNING.  Keep the hoses and unit capped and sealed as moisture in an A/C 
unit is bad.  Also!  Make sure that you have the proper american size 
wrenches when you start putting the hoses on as the copper tubing to the 
coils is ***VERY*** easy to bend if not held properly.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm just hoping that someone out there who used to work VPC or managed to
&gt; get a copy of the manuals from the dealers that closed might be willing to
&gt; share it with me. In the course of my endless surfing in the internet, I've
&gt; come acrossed one or two installation manuals but for the later A/C's. I'll
&gt; look for them in my archive and post it for anyone who might be need it. The
&gt; reason why Dave Bolen caught my attention was reading through the archive,
&gt; it seems that he offered help to Richard Atwell find information on a 78 A/C
&gt; he was inquiring about. At least that's what I gathered from the thread. And
&gt; now, there's info about it on Mr. Atwell's site. I just want to get the
&gt; installation right since it might be waste to experiment on an NOS unit
&gt; fresh from the box. Based on one of Mr. Bolen's post, I'll need a template
&gt; to make a perfect installation. And that information you don't get everyday
&gt; from your regular Type 2 enthusiast.
&gt; 
&gt; Back in January 2001, Joseph Clark offered to share the photocopies of the
&gt; installation manual of  a DPD A/C unit that he has with the list. Just
&gt; trying my luck.
