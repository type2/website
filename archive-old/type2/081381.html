Subject: New Bus

Hey all

I just got a new to me, 1979 Bus.  Not much rust, doesn't run.

Previous owner says it lost all its oil one day, he didn't know why.  One
thing, though, there is no seal around the engine.  If the engine overheats,
will it purge the oil somehow?  I can't see any holes in the engine, and the
bottom of it isn't any more oilyer(?) than my 76 which runs fine.

How much different is anything on a 79 than a 76?
