&gt; &lt;&lt; First: Does my 68 have a synchro on 1st gear?  I rarely drive my camper in
&gt; stop and go traffic but sometimes I can't avoid this.  I find that if I
&gt; apply a hard foot on the brake pedal I can get into first without coming to
&gt; a complete stop (under 5 mph).  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Worn synchro...Replace or learn the technique all LBC (Little British Car)
&gt; owners of a certain age (and you know who you are) have developed...

also called &quot;double clutching&quot; for obvious reasons

&gt; With a tach, or an educated ear, the clutch can be dispensed with 
&gt; for all but dead starts (not recommended !!! but it can be done...)

what your supposed to use the clutch when changing gears while moving???
