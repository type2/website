Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Clocks (for under $5)

Hi Greg,

I had some time to play with a spare dash pod yesterday, and decided to 
install a AA battery-powered clock into it. You can get a decent 1.5V AA 
quartz clock mechanism from the dollar store and I discovered that 
installing it into the dash pod was much easier than I thought it would 
be. It sure beats paying over $100 to get one from eBay.

I removed the backing plate, drilled a hole in the center and then 
installed the mechanism. The number plate was created using a scan of 
the speedometer, so the numbers are a perfect match.  I printed the 
clock face on my laser printer here at home, tomorrow at the office I 
will probably reprint the image onto card-stock using the $10K colour 
laser and re-install it.

A member of another list I'm on suggested running a remote power supply 
from the glove box to make battery changes a lot easier.

Happy trails,

&gt; hey listees!

&gt; In my desperation to install a clock in my 74 single cab, I had to get 
&gt; innovative.  I earlier purchased a gray faced clock from a fellow 
&gt; listee which did not work when I received it (through no fault of the 
&gt; seller).  I later purchased a black faced clock (which does work) from 
&gt; another very nice listee.  I simply took the gray face off the 
&gt; non-working clock and put it on the working clock!  The faces are 
&gt; identical in every way except the color.  All in all, not too 
&gt; complicated.  Just a thought for those also trying to find clocks that 
&gt; work.
