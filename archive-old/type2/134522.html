Subject: RE: [T2] Definitely a Friday topic

You mean there were bus related anthems?

Prolly a whole lot of old stuff from the Dead or other 60's era bands that
would work for a splitty, but for a bay?  from the era of the great age of
motor city and 'no replacement for displacement' method of thinking?  I'm at
a loss for bus music.  Now party music,.. lot's of party type music from
70's, just pick your favorite genre at the time...
