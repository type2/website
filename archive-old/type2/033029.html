Subject: transmission of mystery

Hi everyone,
    Thanks for the responses to my previous post. When we last left my
69 camper it was making a loud, clacking noise in reverse. The noise was
not evident in other gears, but in neutral there would appear a quiet
clicky-rumbly sound. The sounds seem to be coming from the differential
area. Here are some more clues: the engine is a 1600 dp, the
transmission is a '71 or later (I could get the # if anyone suspects an
engine/tranny compatibility issue) the clutch, pressure plate &amp; release
bearing are all new. The noise appeared during a week of -40 weather in
Minnesota. The noise sounds louder inside the bus than it is outside. It
is hard to get into 1st and 2nd gear. It does not pop out of any gear.
If anyone has had similar problems or has any suspicions as to what may
be the problem and or cure, let me know!
Thanks,
Jefner
