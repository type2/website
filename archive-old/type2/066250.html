I was in Mexico earlier this year.  I still have a picture of a
brandy-new white Mexi-panel-Bus on my desk.   I scanned it and I think
I dropped it off on techie.phys.sfu_dot_ca.

Not only are they more powerful than my '78 Westy, that bizzaro top 
gives you a couple of extra inches headroom inside, and they are quiet.
Quiet like Jetta or Eurovan.

And they have really cool new upholstery.  It's odd to look in a '95
bus and see the exact same dash and everything as my '77.  I was thinking
of ordering a new interior from VW of Mexico...
