&gt; How to time a 2000cc FI engine?
&gt; plug dist, vacum lines?  how many degrees?

You time it according to the distributor you have in it.
If it is a 021P or 022S it will have a single vacuum unit and you time it at
7.5 before at idle with the vacuum line connected.
If you have a Cal version with electronic ignition, 039C, it will have a
dual vacuum unit and you time it at 5 after at idle with the vacuum lines
connected.

&gt; What type of spark plugs are the best for this engine?

I like the correct Bosch plugs. NON resister + NON platinum.
