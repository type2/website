&gt;I,ve followed the tire threads with interest and finally went over to my
FLTS,
&gt;pleasant suprise for us westy owners, yokohama y356 in LT 195/74-14 for 59.00
&gt;US. These are an 8 ply tire. This was at Americas tires here in Corona. Usual
&gt;disclaimers, have no interest, plus mounting, ymmv,yada yada

I just ordered a set of 356's from the Tire Rack.  Came to $260 total
shipped to GA.  I think they were $230 before shipping.  They seem great so
far.
