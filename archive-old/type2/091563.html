Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel cylinders - Do Type3 fit Type 1??

Yes this is soooooooo correct! While not on a bus I can attest to this
on another vehicle. I spent some time experimenting on putting disc
brakes on my 76 IH Scout. Worked good, except for one thing. I didn't
have the proportions correct. One morning a light turned before I
expected it &amp; I slid right through the light (w/ a semi coming quite
close). My front wheels were still fine, but the rear ones had locked
up. If anyone considers it I would seriously consider doing some
serious research into what is needed to reduce the pressure to the
rear brakes.

&gt; Another thing to consider is the stopping power of rear discs.  Don't you 
&gt; need a proportioning valve to lessen the pressure to the rear brake 
&gt; hydraulics, so you don't lock and slide under hard braking?  The chances of 
&gt; such an occurrence with rear drums is MUCH less, is it not?  Hydraulic 
&gt; gurus?  Anyone?  Bueller? ;^)
