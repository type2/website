Subject: Aux Battery

Hi,

   Today I managed to change my oil and clean the oil bath air filter on my
'72 dormobile... When removing the oil bath I noticed that there was a relay
with wiring leading to the left hand side of the engine for a auxillary
battery ! Just what I need :)

   The only problem is a couple of the wires are lose and I'm not sure where
they go... Theres a picture of the relay with the current
connections at http://www.neuro-net.co_dot_uk/relay.jpg. If there are any 
electricians out there please take a look... I
am hoping that this is a proper aux battery relay.. then I won't have to
spend any money down the hardware store... :)

The relay is currently connected to the regulator, body (earth) and main
battery, the other connectionings are taped up..

Cheers

Dave K.
