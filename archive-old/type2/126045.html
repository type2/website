Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plugs

I read (but can't find) info a while ago that said that platinum plugs are a
waste of money. Apparently your mileage increases only when you gap the
platinum plugs a little wider than the regular plugs, and THEN it's only to
make regular mileage that normal plugs give you anyway.
When I was on the Type 3 list I found that a number of people spit a plug
during a long distance trip. I don't know why. Bring the helicoil stuff if
you suspect that you might spit a plug.
