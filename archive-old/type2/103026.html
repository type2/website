Subject: Re: [T2] weird engine noise in park?

&gt; there is a weird engine noise when I put my 78 FI automatic westy in
&gt; park.  It is kind of a whine that gets louder and higher in pitch for
&gt; a couple of seconds then it levels off but does not go away until I
&gt; stop the engine...any ideas?

change your fluid, clean the filter, if you haven't done so recently.

. check to see that the shift linkage adjustment is correct
. check that the three bolts holding the torque converter to the flex
plate are tight, torque to spec, these bolts are not interchangeable and
will scrap if not tight
. check for metal flakes in fluid
. does fluid smell burnt
. possible beginning failure of torque converter one way clutch.


any other symptoms other than noise, does this noise also occur in other
gears?
