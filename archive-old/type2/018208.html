&gt; Also, here in the 'Warm California Sun' the local Bus guy says to remove
&gt; both air flaps that are controlled by the bellows...we have very little
&gt; freezing weather down here in the low lands, and removing the 'flaps' should
&gt; allow for improved cooling thru the oil cooler - right...?
&gt; 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Removing the flaps will result in NO air being directed through the oil
cooler.  If you look closely at how the flaps work, you will see that
when they are closed, the left side flap raises up off of the oil
cooler.  This restricts air flow over the heads and stops flow through
the oil cooler.  When they open, the left flap lowers and seals off the
top of the oil cooler.  What's happening is that air is flowing from the
fan housing on both sides of the flap.  On the top side of the flap
where you can see, the air goes over the heads and cylinders.  On the
bottom side air is flowing and is forced through the oil cooler due to
the flap laying on top of the cooler.  Remove this flap and you might as
well remove the oil cooler because it won't be doing you any good.
