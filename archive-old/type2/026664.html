	BTW, the better isolators get around the problem of voltage drop by
	sensing the voltage downstream of the isolator.  This voltage is fed
	to the alternator's regulator which fools the alternator into
	producing the extra voltage needed to overcome the isolators drop.
I
	don't know if this applies to the VW setup, though.

	George, according to the SurePower technical rep, they have special
isolators which have an extra &quot;Regulator&quot; terminal to do just that.
However, he said that this still won't prevent the one voltage drop from the
isolator.  It does prevent an extra one volt drop, for a total of 2 volts
drop on all Bosch alternators.  If anyone knows where I could get an
isolator that has a feature that allows full voltage to the batteries please
let me know.  Seriously, it seems like someone must have figured out how to
do this.
