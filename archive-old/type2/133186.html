Subject: Re: [T2] US elections

Joaquim,

Umm, charter rules don't specifically list politics, but we don't talk it 
cause it's not about buses...that why this list is exceptionally good.

And, it's a good topic to avoid this year.
And, if someone started it, the admins would ban or moderate them off the 
list.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Why do you US guys NEVER go off-topic and
