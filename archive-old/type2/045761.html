Subject: [T2] Mystery Injectors

In looking through my stuff for my bus injectors, I came upon some
*other* injectors I had forgotten I had, and don't remember their
source, Bosch part # 0 280 150 102.  All I know about these is that they
are not for the bus, according to the Bosch parts reference in the
type2_dot_com library.  Please somebody point me (off list) to another info
source for Bosch FI parts, so I can find these new injectors a home.
