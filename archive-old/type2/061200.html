Subject: Anyone moving East from Northern, CA???

Just wondering if any listees, or friends, were moving East (preferably taking
Interstate 80) anytime soon. I have a van I would like to get out to the
Colorado/Wyoming area A.S.A.P. Hoping someone might be renting a moving van
that would be willing to tow it along. I would definitely make it worth your
wild &amp; have all the arrangements made so it would be very little
inconvenience. Willing to meet you along whatever route you are taking, and
tow it myself the rest of the way. If by any chance there is anyone
interested, please E-me directly soon, as I need to get this going
immediately.

TIA
