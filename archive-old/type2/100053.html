Subject: Re: [T2] southwind heater pump

The &quot;mistery port&quot; is the return line back to the fuel line, it came off the
&quot;high&quot; side of the pump and would return the fuel instead of putting extra
stress on the actuator inside the fuel pump.

I have NOS factory rebuild manuals that are not listed on my site for $25,
these are in excellent shape, no water stains or any curled pages.

I am the only direct VW SouthWind factory parts rep, so if you need tune up
parts or manuals for any of the VW SouthWinds, go to:

http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/busbarn/southwind.html

I am now working on getting the labels next for all the different models.

&gt; So I got a southwind heater from someone today (thanks Randy) &amp;
&gt; working on testing this, that &amp; the other. How is this heater plumbed
&gt; up for the fuel tank? The fuel pump has an inlet, an outlet, &amp; a
&gt; mystery port. What does this hook to? TIA
