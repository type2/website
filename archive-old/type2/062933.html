Subject: '59 beetle

once again...

another question.  i know it's not a type 2 (duh), but i located a '59
beetle for sale.  it looks to be in really good shape (decent paint and
interior).  however, i do not know as of now how it runs.  is that a six
volt car?

anyway, the owner wants $1200 for it.  anyone in the mississippi gulf coast
area interested, mail me.
