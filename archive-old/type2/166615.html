Subject: RE: [T2] In the AC world again....

Rob, thank you for taking the time to share ...  I am happy to see that you
are in western WA.  It is simply great when people put their location, along
with their late bay type 2 vehicle.   I adjusted my signature accordingly.


&gt;&gt;The guy said it had bad valves and I did hear a ticking noise so I had it
towed home, I really didn't want to lose a valve and trash the engine.

Rob, did you ask the PO why they thought the valves were bad??  If so, and
they answered, what did they say??

Since you had a '79 before, you are probably aware of the one-year only
exhaust system for the '79.  Do you have a good exhaust setup. that is,
driver side heat exchanger, crossover pipe, cat converter, EGR filter - - -
