Subject: re: engine hatch above engine

Paul wrote:
&gt;A quick question. In John Muirs book (How To Keep
Your 
&gt;Volks Alive) he swiftly mentions a hatch above the
&gt;engine bay in post '75 buses which can be opened for
&gt;easy access to the engine. I've never heard of one
and &gt;my '75 bus does not have one, is this a mith or
is my &gt;bus from before they were introduced?

They started making buses with the hatch over the
engine in 1973 if I remember correctly. The '72
models, first year of the new engine, didn't have one
and they must have learned from that as they started
putting in the access hatch the next year.  Are you
sure yours is a '75 model? Or are they different &quot;over
there&quot;?  (I'm assuming Paul is in England, etc.,
because of his email address)
