Subject: Re: [T2] Starter solenoid problem 

i agree with Phil on this one.  try the starter relay kit from
Bus Depot for a 6 dollar fix. also, as a recent post has
indicated, taking the starter out for some maintenence
wouldn't be a bad idea, either.

good luck,

&gt; The bad news?  Yesterday..... lights came on, no
&gt; clickety-click.  Assuming it's solenoid again - have
&gt; not had a chance to look at it yet.
                                                    
&gt;&gt;sounds like you have a wiring problem, need to install
one of those hot start kits to bypass all the wiring.
