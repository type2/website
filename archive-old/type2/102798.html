Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch H4 ... and less expensive alternatives

Robert--

Now were talking---

It's a sense of value's my man--

First the beer's, then the steak's, then a &quot;couple&quot; more of the
brewtowski's--and then maybe I'll start thinking about what type of
light I'll need.---:&gt;)

All kidding aside, it's not just the name on the lamp-- or the snob
value--the bigger dollar units do throw one heck of a beam on the
asphalt--and I kinda wanted to see where I was going at night.

The pakostanley's unit's are kinda indiscriminate where they lay the
beam on the road--

And yep--they are better than the sealed beams--
Just kinda weird to see the cuts in the lens projected out in front of
you on the pavement--

Later,

Terry

Pop for the Bosch--
and be out $100 for a pair of headlamps
You only get what you pay for---
And interestingly, you can also get much much less than you pay for.
I found the $35 Pakistani/Indian knock-offs were an improvement over the
sealed headlamps I was previously using and that's all I was looking
for. I was, and still am satisfied with the purchase. Now, they might
not sport the &quot;snob value&quot; of Hellas or Bosch or Mercedes or Porsch ....
but, they work and they mounted in the place were the old sealed
headlamps went and for my 21 year old Volks Wagen vehicle..... they do
just fine. :-)
Now how should I spend the extra $65 dollars I saved on headlamps ? CV
Boots all round? Poptop seal? Nice steak dinner? Brewskies?
