Subject: Re: [T2] idle woes - was engine woes

Tom,

I noticed your year info as I hit reply earlier....duh on my part&lt;grin&gt;.

Electric fuel pump has a pressure adjustment then...hmmm...interesting.

*some* smoke from the breather hose is pretty normal....you are supposed 
to not see it though, cause it goes straight back down the carb to be 
burned.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I think my high idle woes are from out of synch carbs.  I put the unisyn on
&gt; them last night and the right one was WAY out.  Any thoughts on why I would
&gt; be getting smoke coming out my breather hose?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Fi fuel pressure regulator is a &quot;sealed&quot; unit and *not* normally
&gt; &gt; adjustable(there &quot;are&quot; ways to do this though).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Carbed engine is usually only adjustable by changing gaskets under the
&gt; &gt; fuel pump....
