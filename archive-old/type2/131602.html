Subject: Endplay? Crank Travel?

Okay list is this a big problem or what?

2.0L GEX stripped down to a little less than a longblock. Flex plate is off, 
seal is removed, three shims found, have not removed the hub on the rear 
(RIR) yet. My crankshaft seems to be traveling quite a bit. Maybe 2.0mm - 
2.5mm. This can't be good or I am just losing it. What tolerance should I be 
looking for? Will the shims and flexplate make up the difference here? 
Comments, suggestions, all welcome and needed badly.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
