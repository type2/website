Subject: Re: [T2] 69 bus in movie

Sorry all about the mix-up but I didn't see pictures of the bus, I was  going 
by an interview by one of the actors and they said &quot;He had to drive around  
in a 69 VW it was the craziest thing he ever had to do&quot;, I assumed it was the  
bus he was talking about. my mistake.
