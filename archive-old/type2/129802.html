&gt; not near that far. I'm 45 minutes west of Nashville (which has many
&gt; auto paint supply stores). It's still a several hour drive if you want
&gt; to see Graceland :)

You aren't far from the &quot;Land Between the Lakes&quot; which, for those of 
you who haven't been there, is absolutely beautiful.  Fishing, sailing, 
water-skiing, cycling, mountain biking and, of course, great camping.
