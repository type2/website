Subject: Type 1 engine thermostat location

I wrote this up in my blog when I did the thermostat in my van which has a
1600 engine. There is a photo of the device itself so you can see the
bracket and location. The picture is taken from the back of the bus.

Hope this helps

Phil

Subject: [T2] Type 1 engine thermostat location


Where is the thermostat located on a type 1 engine??  I see so many beetles
in this yard that I am sure some of them should still have the thermostat on
them.
