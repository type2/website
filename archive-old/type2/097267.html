Subject: Re: [T2] Advice for Dual Weber

[...]

Whoa, before you blame all this on just the carbs, you need to look elsewhere.
1) Are both accelerator pumps working correctly?
2) It sounds like you have NO vacuum advance in your distributor.
28 _at_ 2000 appears to be centrifugal only. You need to stop playing with the
carbs and regroup your thoughts. Do a little more research on your timing. Not
at idle, but the whole range.


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I still have some dam? problem with my Dual Solex 34pisd 3/2 1973 (just
&gt; rebuilt those!!!)
&gt; http://www.letambourin_dot_com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm
&gt;
&gt; They pissed me off! period! (No air leak, compression is over 100psi,
&gt; valves are at 006)
&gt; Problem:
&gt; Still some (to be polite) hesitation at low RPM, in other words: when i
&gt; change from second gear to third, the bus is having some hard time
&gt; getting some decent RPM (i have no torque! with some small hesitation, i
&gt; have to press the gas pedal hard to get some power!!!) once i get some
&gt; RPM the bus run good put i feel that i have to press the gas pedal a bit
&gt; more than before to get to the same speed (60mph). I HAVE PLAYED WITH
&gt; THE SCREWS like hell!!! and i don't feel much difference. I have NO air
&gt; leak!!!! (now)
&gt; If you have any advice son the Solex (before i buy new carbs), please
&gt; give those now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; (screws position for now, both idle mixture screws are at 2.5 turn out,
&gt; the main mixture screw is also at 2.5 out. Dwell is 48 at 7.5BTDC (no
&gt; retard vacuum), total advance at 2000RPM is about 28gdeg.)
&gt; Note: i live in Montreal Canada, it's in the 40-50F right now so i have
&gt; to run those rich.
&gt;
&gt; I can see 2 problem, the old distibutor is giving me a hard time
&gt; (centifugal parts are loose inside) or the carbs are going away.
&gt; I am thinking of buying a 050 distributor!
&gt; -is it the best choice! How is the 009???? (cheaper)
&gt; -Also, can i try my stock distributor with new Weber carbs???
&gt;
&gt; So my best choice for new carb (quality VS price) would be the Dual
&gt; Weber 34mm ICT (i can get those for 359$USD (589$CAD) I need advice from
&gt; people that run those!!!!!!!!!! Are they easier to ajust????
&gt;
&gt; If you have a better choice for the price please tell me about it!!!
&gt;
&gt; I am out of idea!!!! and solution!!!
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks for any advice!
&gt; Regards, Ben
