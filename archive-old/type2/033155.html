Running a low octane fuel will increase engine temps, all
things being equal.

I've posted on this before. How many on the list complain
that their engine runs hot, even with everything timed and
set perfectly. I'll bet you they run cheap fuel. Others on
the list have posted that they note lower engine temps with
higher octane.

Run what you want. I just like to see facts rather then
opinion. I think MIT (the people that approved the FTP site)
can be relied upon for the facts.

What George posted is correct, if your engine does not
knock, and does not run hot, then there is no difference
between 87 and 91 octane fuel. If your otherwise sound
engine is running hot with 87, try 91 and see what happens.

&gt; &gt; If you can use a FTP site go to
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ftp://rtfm.mit_dot_edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/rec/autos/tech/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Read a little, learn a lot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Octane does not effect your mileage, only the life of your
&gt; &gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; And then, only if the engine pings.  Otherwise there is no difference
&gt; between using 87 and 91.
&gt; 
&gt; The oil companies would like you to think different, of course!
