If, as David says, there is supposed to be a pulley or spacer its lack will
destroy belts. I had an experience years a go with a new Renault Fuego that
lacked the proper spacer on a pulley (less than 1/2 inch thick) from the
factory and until it was added after a re-call it ate belts almost daily.

&gt; Engines without the pulley came with a spacer that is the 
&gt; same thickness.
&gt; You are supposed to have either the spacer or the pulley 
&gt; behind the fan,
&gt; although I can't imagine this being enough of a difference to 
&gt; wear your
&gt; belt out.  It is possible to put the alternator pulley on the 
&gt; alternator
&gt; backwards, in which case it will be farther outboard than it 
&gt; should be.
&gt; Maybe this is your problem?
