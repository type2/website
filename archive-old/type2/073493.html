&gt;I'm considering having that tested again. Don Boneau and I did the test in
&gt;May, and came up with #1 _at_ 128, #2-4 _at_ 115. She's hardly been driven since
&gt;then. That was also when we found out the #2 cylinder wasn't responding to
&gt;removal of the plug wire at the distributor cap.

Test it again - you need to know that it's still okay.  Save yourself some
money and buy the compression tester.  It's a simple procedure and it's a
nice skill to add to your collection.

&gt;&gt;Test
&gt;&gt;for fuel by dripping some fuel in the right carb with a turkey baster or
&gt;&gt;straw while the engine is idling.  Do the cylinders suddenly start firing?
&gt;&gt;Then fuel is your problem.  Otherwise, it's spark.  See how easy that was?
&gt;&gt;:-)
&gt;
&gt;So you're saying I should remove the #1 plug at idle, drop some gas in the
&gt;right carb, and look for hesitation. Repeat with #2 plug. Correct?

No.  Think about what you're trying to prove.  Your hypothesis is that at
idle, the engine is pumping (compression) and the plug is sparking (spark)
but there is no fuel entering the cylinder from the central idling system.
To test this, you will drip some fuel in through the throat of the carb,
which is a crude way of simulating the idling system.  Don't remove the
plugs because you still need them to fire for the test.

&gt;I just don't see how it could be spark since I've replaced everything but
&gt;the rotor -- and how could a rotor only effect two cylinders?

Excellent reasoning but not 100% conclusive.  Wierd things can happen with
spark.  Still I agree that it's probably a fuel problem.

&gt;I did notice that the idle seemed high and she would bog down just about
&gt;when I was ready to shift (higher RPMs). Also, she used to get up to about
&gt;70 before I'd know it, but now it's cruising at 60, but smoother, easier. I
&gt;went back to the mechanic and he adjusted the throttle cable, which he said
&gt;was too tight.

See if you can still go 70.  Your mechanic may have retarded your timing
too much (reduced power) or adjusted your point gap too large (bogging at
high rpms).  Hard to say without seeing it.

&gt;Now, on the way home tonight, she stalls at lights -- not quickly, but say
&gt;if I just hit the red light, just about the time it turns green the idle
&gt;slowly drops off to nothing, and then she doesn't want to start right back
&gt;up again.

If two cylinders aren't working at idle, I'm not suprised.

&gt;And instead of a nice clicking noise from the electric fuel pump,
&gt;it was making this kinda warbly sound (but now it's back to clicking).
&gt;Maybe I need a new fuel pump? But that would just go or no go, right, not
&gt;fade out of service?

Mine made funny noises at times but always worked.  And yes, it would be a
go-nogo thing if the pump failed.

&gt;Central idling system? I haven't a clue what you're talking about.

It's all in Bentley, and Haynes, and even Chilton I think.  Try asking your
mechanic about the central idling system, just for fun.
