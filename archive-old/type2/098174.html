Subject: Warm air intake?

List,
I now see the error of my ways...Last spring I swapped
a single carbed engine into my '72, and instead of
taking the time to replace the single carb with a dual
Solex, I installed the engine as-is with the single
weber carb.  Now that the fall mornings have cooled,
the bus is not happy.  The pipes feeding the intake
are so long that the fuel vapors &quot;freeze&quot;.  I fully
intend on cleaning my dual carbs and inspecting them
when I have time, likely this winter, then installing
them.  Two part question:

First, is there a short term &quot;fix&quot;?  What I am
thinking is finding an air filter with an attachment
that allows me to draw the warm air directly from the
area near the exhaust thinking that the warm intake
air would help alleviate the single carb cold air
problem.  I would not run with this set-up year round,
just in the cool times this fall.  Will this have any
adverse (overheating) effect on the engine?

Second, How difficult will it be to swap carbs with
the engine in?  I am not opposed to dropping the
engine and swapping the carbs, should just be a
weekend project.  Just curious.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.
