&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; well, i got the alternator in suprisingly easy today. thanks to sean and
&gt; stefan for help/pointers.
&gt; 
&gt; drove to work today. van ran great. but when i got to work i noticed a massive
&gt; oil leak. within 2 minutes it looked like most of my oil was on the ground.
&gt; seemed like it was coming from the front of the transmission. towards the
&gt; front of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; hmm, what is going on here? what is the fix?&gt;

Jonathan , 

 Well it could be that the rear engine seal is Ku-Put....
The only known fix for this is to 
           ...... PULL THE ENGINE.......
if its not fixed the oil will contaminate the clutch and 
yu'll need to replace the clutch as well..... =(
hopefully its no the seal thats gone Awry.

I had a 71 that had a leak that sounds exact like what you described
but it wasnt only the seal that went bad, the crank had smashed the rear
main bearing splitting it in half so the crank had a LOT of play......
But any ways .....

Hope that helps
