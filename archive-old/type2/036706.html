First, thanks to everyone who showed up yesterday at the VW Bus Round Up in 
Leesburg. We all had a very nice lunch at Ruby Tuesdays, followed by lots of 
VW Bus talk afterwards in the parking lot. For those that couldn't make it, 
hope to see you next time. Now for the doglegs, well, they say a picture is 
worth a thousand words, so follow the link below if you'd like to see my 
project.         Jeff &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/rusty.html&quot;&gt;
