Howdy all. I have gotten the Search &amp; Rescue shirts and the Truckin' shirts
back from the printers. If you only ordered those, be on the lookout in the
next couple days. If you ordered a Netvergnu:gen shirt, it will probably be
another couple weeks, because of the detail in the artwork. Also, if you
ordered tie-dye, that will also take another week or two to get done.
Anyway, just thought I'd give an update. Many thanks to all those who ordered.
:)
