 the deep end

let's also take into account price/$$$$ or lack there of..

if the reliability of a NEW $10,000 vehicle is dependant on owning $10,000
worth of diagnostic equipment and tools, then I'll take an old bus any
time!!!

My definition of reliability:
if you can fix 80% of  problems that would leave you stranded, NORMAL every
day tools, and for less than $100 then its reliable.

now..... while agree with:
    &quot; can't even recommend with a clear conscience
    that my mom buy an older bus - she does NOT need to be worrying about
    mechanical problems.&quot;

when my kids leave for collage (no there not born yet) an Air Cooled BUS
will be my recommended vehicle of choice. for LOW COST reliability, and life
long lessons in patients and nurturing a good'ol type 2 CAN'T BE BEAT!
