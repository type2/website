Subject: blue smoke from tailpipe means ...?

Hello Type 2,

I've got a problem with my 76'Westy:
	(american 76'bus reimported to Germany, 
	german 78'engine, 2000ccm, two carburetors)
I have my bus for four years now and once replaced a cylinder head 
about two years ago (I only replaced the #3 - #4 - side, question of 
money :-] ). The bus went fine for about 2500 mls with his new 
head, with an acceptable power and few oil consumption.

After that, the bus was standing for about 10 month in an shed,
until I wanted  to pass the (german) smog test. When I started the 
engine, I saw a small amount of blue smoke from the tailpipe. I 
couldn't drive the bus for a longer distance, so I let it idle. I thought
that the smoke would disappear once the engine was warm enough
and running for about 10 minutes. But it didn't ! It was even worse
when the oil reached it's operating temperature of about 90°C.

I checked the compression and it seemed good to me:
about 10 &quot;bar&quot; (= 1,000,000 Pascal; how much &quot;psi&quot; is that?) 
on each cylinder (on the cold engine) . 
I also checked the valve lash (was O.K.). When I turned the engine 
by hand for this purpose, I heard an unusual noise (sounded like 
PFFFRRRRT on every movement of the crankshaft) when I was 
 near the #4 power stroke.
I then replaced the lid of the left carb (it had a broken thread 
anyway), but the engine smoked as it did before after all these 
checks.
	What happens in my engine? 
	Can I check anything else ?
	Valve guides?

Thank you for some useful hints. 
And please excuse my weakness in writing English.
