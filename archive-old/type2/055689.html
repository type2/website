Subject: tents and leaks

&gt;&gt;{{I have to say this,,,nobody trenches around their tent anymore. Low
&gt;&gt;impact is a good skill to work on with
&gt;&gt;the number of people who take to the woods these days.}}

&gt;speaking of low impact. . .we could all impact the woods a lot less and
&gt;the planet as well if we would just limit our families. Even if we
&gt;practice low impact in the woods, when the population doubles again in 34
&gt;years, will it even matter?

Talking of low impact, if one does not need all that space why have a type 2
in the first place!
If we all limit our family to one or two children we could all drive around
in Nissan Micras. If we wanted to go to the woods we could just take a tent!
