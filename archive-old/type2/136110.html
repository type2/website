&gt; Currently, I have a hose running from the left side

&gt; distributer).&lt;&lt;
&gt;  Where does the idle retard hose connect to?&lt;&lt;

On your 34-pict3 carb, there should be a vacuum port
on the rear of the carb body, facing toward the rear
of the bus. This is where the retard vac hose
connects.
