Subject: 71 westy runnin on 3 cylinders

Well we started our journey this weekend to the Oregon coast.  It was a bit 
cold, however we had a yurt with heat.  The ride home sounded louder than 
normal.  Well when we arrived home I lisrtened to the engine and heard 
ticking on drivers side.  Checked spark plug wires and #4 was barely on 
(probably was not connected), also looked inside and the metal looked 
cracked in inside of cap?  Also the plug was loose?  We didn't loose any 
power or see any bad smoke.  We also took the flat roads from portland to 
the beach.  I am gettin a new set of wires tonight and checkin the plugs as 
well as the valves/timing.  Could this have hurt my engine?  Any suggestions 
or have other folks had this happen?
Thanks Michael in Oregon
