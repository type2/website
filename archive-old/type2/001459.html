Please disregard the price as this has now turned into &quot;a really good story&quot;
contest -- for listmembers ONLY! Please keep them coming in as I will make
my decision on Monday late.

Thanks for the bandwidth.

&gt; Price is $15 or B.O. from listmembers ONLY, plus shipping. Item is not
&gt; heavy. I am in MT, USA. If I hear a &quot;really good story&quot; as to why
&gt; they need
&gt; this for their Westy (not the obvious reason), then it's free
&gt; plus shipping.
