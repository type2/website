Subject: Re: [T2] camper info wanted

Hi Volks,

It was in 1974 that the double-bed westfalia poptop roof was 
introduced. My 1973 westy had a single-bed pop-top, and the westfakia 
was created using the roof from a 1974 westy.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;     I seem to be having a senior moment and can't remember something.
&gt; Could someone please tell me what was the first year the westphalia
&gt; campers had the double bed up top.
