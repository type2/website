Porsche co-founder
       dies

       In her 95 years, Louise
       Piech-Porsche raced cars and
       built an empire

       February 10, 1999: 11:36 a.m. ET


 VIENNA, Austria (Reuters) - Louise
 Piech-Porsche, co-founder of German
 sports car maker Porsche AG, died
 Wednesday, Porsche Holding announced.
 She was 95.
   Piech-Porsche died in the family's
 holiday home in the Austrian mountain
 resort of Zell am See, the Salzburg-based
 car importer and dealer said.



        The very first Porsche, 1948

   Together with her brother Ferry
 Porsche, who died last year at age 88,
 she founded the Porsche company in
 Austria in 1947, and made 53 cars before
 moving to Stuttgart in 1950.
   Piech-Porsche also established
 Austria's main importer of Volkswagen
 cars, now known as Porsche Holding,
 creating one of the country's most
 successful private companies.
   The daughter of automobile pioneer
 Ferdinand Porsche and sister of Ferry,
 who designed the first Porsches -- the
 356 series --and the Volkswagen Beetle,
 Piech-Porsche was an early car
 enthusiast, racing cars in the 1930s.



   &quot;First I drove my father's car, then my
 brother's sports cars and now my son's,&quot;
 Piech-Porsche was often quoted as
 saying.
   She was born in Vienna in 1904 and in
 1928 married Viennese lawyer Anton
 Piech, with whom she had four children.
   Her son Ferdinand Piech is chairman
 of Volkswagen.
   Like other family members,
 Piech-Porsche owned 10 percent of both
 Porsche Holding and Porsche AG.
   A Porsche Holding spokesman said it
 is unclear what will happen with the
 shares.
