Subject: BBTA Report/cops, etc.

I will try to keep this brief.  I only attended the event on Saturday 
night.  Had a great time meeting Dave Easterwood, Jim Kirk and his 
wife Kate, Jon and Tony Christensen (met previously), Sami Dakhlia and 
wife Maria and daughter (name escapes me), Tom Forhan (too briefly), 
Eric Burdis and his traveling partner, Pete Sellers and wife Rose, 
Dave Schwarze and that lovely camper, I have space envy.  Many other 
friendly folks shared a nod and hello.  Over all, a great group of 
people.

This was my first VW type event and Heather and I enjoyed it very 
much.  (We had the porta bathroom along.)  Here in the rust belt it is 
rare to see a split window bus.  Seeing several dozen in one spot was
a real treat.  Many very nice buses were in attendance.  Many others 
were included in the well loved but very used catagory.  I fall into 
the later. :)

Many thanks to the attendies and organizers of this event.  I will 
probably go again if the chance comes my way.  Thanks in particular to
Sami for getting us all together for the Sunday lunch and providing 
his home as a meeting place.  I hope to see you all again in the near
and distant future.

Worth noting in reference to an earlier thread:  On the way home from 
Columbia about 5 miles south of Macon, Missouri on highway 63 I saw 
three police cars on the side of the road.  Lights were blaring and 
they had one car sitting there.  No good.  I have nothing hide but I 
don't want my bus taken apart.  I was running first in a caravan of 
four vehicles all running the same speed.  We all changed lanes to the
left on as a courtesy to the cars parked on the shoulder.  As we got 
closer an officer started walking into the right lane towards us.  I 
slowed to probably 45.  As the second car passed she stepped into the 
lane and waved down cars number 3 and 4.  I, and probably the guy 
behind me, let out a sigh and continued on our merry way.  I supposed 
this was some random 'safety check'.  I have heard of them but never 
seen one in action.

Take care, Jim
