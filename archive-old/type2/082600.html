Depends on whether or not your bus is lowered and has
a freeway flyer!!

&gt; Mark your calenders now for June 1st, Heartland Park
&gt; Racetrack, Topeka KS.
&gt; 
&gt; This will be one heck of a fun weekend and one like
&gt; no other VW event
&gt; anywhere!!
&gt; 
&gt; Friday evening starts off with camping on the
&gt; racetrack grounds with an
&gt; option to see some great dirt track racing.
&gt; 
&gt; Saturday is the MoKan Bug Blitz, Bus Blast car show
&gt; set up on the staging
&gt; lanes of the NHRA drag strip.  Swap meet will be
&gt; beside the staging lanes in
&gt; the VIP parking area.  A HUGE raffle with tons of
&gt; prizes will be going on
&gt; most of the day.
&gt; 
&gt; Not only is this a great car show, swap meet, raffle
&gt; and campout, but the
&gt; camping area will also have a class in judging!! 
&gt; That's right, we are going
&gt; to judge the campers and camp sites where they are
&gt; set up.  Best camper,
&gt; most creative camp site, most &quot;lived in&quot; etc.  We
&gt; can do this because
&gt; everything is together, no need to move to the show
&gt; from the campout, you're
&gt; part of the show!!
&gt; 
&gt; We can't stop the fun here, during the show, the
&gt; SCCA (Sports Car Club of
&gt; America) is holding a national meet on the Heartland
&gt; Park road course and
&gt; will be running all their classes.  One class of
&gt; particular interest is the
&gt; Formula Vee racers which base their formula styled
&gt; cars on the VW platform.
&gt; These things are exciting to watch.  Your pass into
&gt; the BBBB show will also
&gt; let you view all of the SCCA road racing too!!
&gt; 
&gt; To top off a great weekend, on Sunday around noon,
&gt; the SCCA will let anyone
&gt; who pays a $5 insurance fee drive the racetrack
&gt; behind a pace car!!  I can
&gt; see it now, splitties and bays leaning into the
&gt; curves, drivers white
&gt; knuckled on the steering wheels, grinning from ear
&gt; to ear!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Have you ever heard of a VW show with this much
&gt; action going on?  This ain't
&gt; your grandpas sit'in show, we've taken the VW show
&gt; to a new level!!  We hope
&gt; to make this a yearly event and want as many bus
&gt; campers as can show up to
&gt; make the campout a huge success too.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the weekend after Memorial, so use the
&gt; Memorial weekend to get your
&gt; bus ready.  
&gt; 
&gt; Heartland Park is just 1.5 hours from Kansas City, 8
&gt; hours from Denver, 8
&gt; hours from Dallas, 5 hours from Oklahoma City, 3
&gt; hours from Omaha, and 6
&gt; hours from St. Louis.
