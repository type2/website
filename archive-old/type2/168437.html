Subject: Wheel bearings

I installed new front wheel bearings today to resolve the &quot;loose&quot;
passenger side wheel. My question is how tight should the clamp nut
be? Bently says 7 ft lbs. My torque wrench doesn't read that low. I
tightened the clamp nut to what felt right. It ended up being about a
quarter turn tigher than it was before. I reassmebled everything and
now the wheel turns more freely. No wobble anymore, which is a huge
relief. Only sound is the brake pads slightly touching when i turn the
wheel, which it did before.

How can I tell if I got it right.

I was thinkign I might re-check it after a few miles and reasses.


thanks
Eddie
