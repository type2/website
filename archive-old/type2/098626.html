&gt; Sorry 3/8 fuel line is not big enough. You need 5/8 or 10,12 mm for the

I'd love to hear some clarification.  I've heard now that he needs 10mm,
11mm, 1/2&quot;, 5/8&quot;, and now 12mm.

3/8&quot; is just a shade smaller then 10mm as I recall.
7/16&quot; would be 11mm.
1/2&quot; would be 13mm.
And now you're saying that he needs 5/8&quot; line (~15mm) to fit a 10 or 12mm
nipple?

(now that I know this is an FI system, I'd recommend the 1/2&quot; line, since
I recall that 3/8&quot; is indeed to small for the FI nipples.  10mm for
pre-FI, 12mm for FI.  Be sure to clamp'm.)

But whatever size you decide fits, the important point of the whole
discussion is to be SURE to use line that is rated for gasoline.
