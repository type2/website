Subject: Re: Master cylinder off, brake line advice?

Hi Ken,
It struck me as funny, if I could have gotten a bus with mechanical brakes I
probably would have that first time I tried to bleed those front ones, (with
the bleeder for the cylinder on the bottom)!
The tubing flare can be a wrench or a crows foot, (the wrench that you need
to attach to an extention). Works good when you have a hard to reach flare nut.
As to cresent wrenches I always turn mine over to read the length in mm when
I'm working on the VW. If it's an American car I read it in inches. And I
feel better every time I do that! Gotta go,
Rob.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thoses hoses are at FLAPS, all tooled up and ready to go on. Splits + 68
&gt;&gt;&gt;use one size, 70-on uses another (I believe that's right).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;With my luck I'd need one for a '69!
&gt;
&gt;Dag! Either 69s have no brake lines or I should not go jabbering away at
&gt;6:30 in the morning. ;)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you are going to buy a flare wrench you might think about getting a flare
&gt;&gt;crowsfoot instead. I have used those on harder to get to lines.
&gt;
&gt;OK, what's the difference? I don't know the name of the tool I'm talking
&gt;about. If it were my druthers I'd call it a crescent wrench, because that's
&gt;how it's shaped, but that name is taken by a less appropriate tool.
