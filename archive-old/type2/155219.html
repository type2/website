Subject: oil stablizer

I think highly of Lucas Products. 

I used it in my jeep when I accidentally ran it dry for 1.5 minutes.

That was the length of time for me to utter H******Ly something.

Anyhow, there was a lot of lifter noise, put the lucas oil stabilizer in and it 
went away.

I plan to use half the quart on my wifes car.

Should I dump the rest in my westy?

I am also putting in Castrol 20W50
