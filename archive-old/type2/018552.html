&gt; A LOT of endplay(?)
&gt; 1 Dumb$ss who thinks he knows something about VW engines
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; BUT....
&gt; When I tried the walk-out test (rotate the crankshaft backwards) the cam
&gt; pulled out of the bearings.  Only then did I notice the -1 stamped on
&gt; the inside cam gear face.  So, I put the 3 rivet cam (no mark on the
&gt; inside face...assuming it is a 0) back in and repeated the test.  It
&gt; also walked out.  I checked
&gt; the idiot book, Wilson, Bentley, and Hoover and cannot find how to
&gt; determine the proper camshaft gear pitch.
&gt;

Further question for the gurus:

I don't know why a new case would have this much endplay (1/8&quot; appearant with
case open) BUT since the case is open and no flywheel is installed AND my
engine stand kinda hangs the engine (not even close to level) would this
affect the walkout test? Should I put the flywheel and shims on?

Just a stab
