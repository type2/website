Subject: Re: [T2] Clock ideas for Bus

I glued the paper one Greg Potts gave me to the existing metal plate, 
drilling a hole in the center. Problem is, the hour hand sticks on the 
paper, so it's always 2:00. But it looks nice!

Not a bad idea.  Here are two concerns:

IIRC, the dial isn't flat, so you'll have to figure out a way to dish the
paper printout.

Many color printer outputs tend to fade in the sun rapidly. Hate to do all
that work and then have it fade out in a few weeks.
