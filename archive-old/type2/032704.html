Why thank you for pointing out the omission, Mark.  If you left San
Diego now you could make it in time all the way to lovely Charleston SC
which is the closest &quot;big&quot; city to Monck's Corner, where the Campout is
going to be.  You didn't perchance find the URL in the announcement that
has maps and stuff did you?

Just in case you (or anyone else) missed it, that was
