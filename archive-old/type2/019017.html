The 78 bus if still having the STOCK heater flapper, has an extra bypass
port which had a (heavy!) pipe that extended rearward, presumably to
direct the excess hot air when heaters were off.  The aftermarket
flapper valve just vents out the excess air to the sides of the valve as
it closes the port to the car vents.  If you want, you can also use the
pleated/foil innards heater hose over the vent ports and wire it in
place. 
   The stock heat system runs air thru the heat exchangers both from the
fan shrouding and from the auxiliary fan found in the roof of your
engine compartment.  It runs from the heat exhangers through large
pleated insulated ducts that connect to the the 2 arms of the Y shaped
duct connnecting the large heat tube under your bus center.
