Subject: [T2] [VB] A.I.R.S. in VW trends

Hmmm....this does indeed come as a surprise to me.  Ryan, the editor of
Trends wrote me last week asking me to write a little about AIRS and send it
to him for the February issue of trends.

I am talking with Wade about hiding the web site until we can take care of
this situation.

Please edit where you need to edit on the AIRS site.  Do this ASAP.  Sorry
for any in-convenience, but be rest assured this was not meant to be.  I did
know the magazine was going to honor Kristin with a memorial article, but I
explained to Ryan that the AIRS site was a type 2 list development and not
something to be announced as being for &quot;general public access&quot;.

Now for those of you that are tempted to holler &quot;I told ya so!&quot;  Go on and
get it out.  Send it to me privately and don't waste the list time with this
egotistical dribble.

AIRS now has roughly 700 members.  That tells me that there are folks out
there that like it being accessible.  I am not worried about some Phish-head
showing up at my door.  If I can help him I will, it's that simple.  That's
how I strive to live, even in these times.

I imagine some will drop off but others will join.  Do what you consider
right regarding your listing with AIRS.  I respect your decision and will
still help if you need me and call on me.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
