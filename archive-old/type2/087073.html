I've got a usable head I could &quot;LEND&quot; him until his comes,  need it for a

&gt; &gt; Anyone correct me if I am wrong, but I heard that certain earlier model
&gt; &gt; heads will fit the 2.0.  Although I cannot remember which ones will.  I
&gt; &gt; believe 1.8 will fit??  Steve Dolan??
&gt; 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; As you might guess, these posts from Troy grow out of a chat session
&gt; yesterday where we had him diagnose his engine woes over the net.  a most
&gt; fascinating excercise!!!  He went out, got a compression tester, tested
&gt; compressions and got (as I remember):
&gt; 
&gt;   #3- 10psi        #1- 90psi
&gt;   #4-120psi        #2-110psi
&gt; 
&gt; We (kp, (real name unknown) and I had him back the adjuster off and try
&gt; again. #3 went up to 30psi.  Oil in the cylinder was no help.  so we had
&gt; him pull the rockers and check for uneven stems.  Stems on #3 were
&gt; (?both?)  very high.  At that point, we told him to put it back together
&gt; and call it a day.  John Anderson showed up at that point and after a bit
&gt; of consulting we decided he was best off removing the plug wire and
&gt; injector plug from #3.  Tho Troy says &quot;cracked&quot; my guess is that he will
&gt; find the classic dropped valve seat when he opens it up.  Final diagnosis
&gt; can await the head replacement, however, as that head will need
&gt; replacement no matter what.
&gt; 
&gt; Troy's situation, as I know it is that this is his sole transport, so
&gt; telling him not to drive is not really an option :-(  I had hoped that
&gt; John had a good used 2L head, John says *I* have his good used head.  A
&gt; quick search of my basement this evening turns up no head :-(  I still
&gt; need to go out to my garage (15 miles away) tomorrow before I give up, but
&gt; I am not hopeful... too damn many boxes :-(
&gt; 
&gt; On head interchange, as someone else said, 1.8 and 2L will fit the 2L jugs
&gt; w/o mods to the heads.  It would be best if he had a 2L, but if a 1.8 is
&gt; all there is, it will probably have to do.  1.7L has a smaller spigot
&gt; diameter and would need to be opened up, not to mention the extra pocket
&gt; that would *really* unbalanace his engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Troy, a question that occurred to me overnight... did you back the
&gt; adjuster off on #1?  did the compression pick up on that cylinder??  We
&gt; got so into #3 that we ignored the lesser evil on the other side.
&gt; 
&gt; I will go out to Springfield to look for the head tomorrow, but if someone
&gt; has a spare good used 2L head, please get in touch with him, eh?
