Subject: RE: [T2] Carpet removal

Hmm, PB Blaster will eat through styro-foam, so maybe it'll eat
through the foam you mention as well.  WD-40 may work too.

Also thinking that a quick pass with a propane torch=20
(quickly and carefully) may work.

&gt; One of the PO's of my 73 Bus glued foam back carpet to the walls and
&gt; ceiling.  As I remove the carpet the foam backing on it is still on
&gt; the walls.  Does anyone know of a way to remove the foam backing
&gt; without destroying the wood panels underneath the foam?

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Kevin
