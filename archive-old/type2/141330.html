Subject: Re: [T2] CDI / Distributor Selection

perhaps your &quot;perfectly working&quot; vacuum setup was not perfectly working
after all. ;-)

I have made this offer before; I'll wager $1000 to anyone that wants to bet
their 009 vs my vacuum , best 2 out of 3

engine temps (oil or head, your choice)
mpg
drivability

provided the carb(s) are SVDA compatible.

the 009 will allow an engine to run, but not even close to &quot;run well&quot;. Most
folks that think a 009 is running well have not compared it to anything.
