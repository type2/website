Subject: Speaking of bus sightings...

Did anyone on the list see a small independent film called
&quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot; with Ryan Gosling and David Morse on the Sundance
channel the last week of January? My '69 Dormobile had a prominent part,
it was filmed here in Montana the year before a house fire claimed my
baby. There are pix of the aftermath of the fire at:
http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/olyolsen13mt
in the &quot;fire&quot; folder.
It was good to see some shots of her prior to her death...
