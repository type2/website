If time is no big issue, I hosed mine down with the cold formula &quot;Easy Off&quot;
and left each in a zip lock bag for a few hours before scrubbing and repeating
the process. Took a couple of days while I was doing other things on the bus.
Do not use regular &quot;Easy Off&quot; since it has lye and eats aluminum.

thats what the wire wheel side of your grinder is for, course you should wear
gloves unless your trying to change your fingerprints and o ya hang on tight
otherwise it makes a nasty dent in the beer fridge. For the ring grooves use a
broken ring.My favorite way to clean is to buy new piston kits
