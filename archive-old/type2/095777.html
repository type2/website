Tyler What is your budget? How involved are you willing to get? The
compression tester does not lie. I would do a careful and complete tune up
then run a compression test to decide which way to go. This would lay you
out $100 tools/parts/manual.

Plan A: Pull your motor with a good floor jack, basic tools instructions
from the Archives, buy a rebuilt longblock from a reputable dealer, spend a
week waiting for it and a couple of days assembling it, putting it in and
getting it to work, then down the road you go. Timeline is 10 days to two
weeks.

Plan B: Buy used copies of the Books;(Wilson/VW Book for physical
procedures, and Muir/VW Book for psychological adjustment, Bentley if you
can find one for $20)a phase one tool kit as described by Muir book, and a
compression tester, and a tune up kit from a parts house. Do a tune up per
the books including a careful valve adjustment. Test the compression per
Muir to confirm the bad valve or investigate exactly what they mean by a
stuck intake valve. There is a procedure for loosening stuck valves
involving liquid. If the valve is burned but the compression is good in the
other cylinders, is it worth replacing the entire block if you can just pull
the motor, head and valve? If the compression is uniformly weak then you
either go back to plan A or Tear it down, split the case, clean it measure
the case bores, have the crank ground, possible but not probable you'd need
the case align bored, new bearings and camshaft, rebuilt lifters, new
Piston/cylinders, or at the very least new rings - so plan B involves time,
money and patience, and the heart to see it through, Plan A depends on money
&amp; courage. Figure out where you fall
on the scale and save that bus - good luck.

i have a 73westy with a pretty much stock 1700cc, i have a stuck intake
valve on the #1 cylinder, i was going to replace the heads on it, and i have
been told by a few people to not put new heads on a worn motor, so, i am
looking to buy a new 1700,or rebuild mine, i have never pulled the motor
before, so does anybody have any tips for pulling the motor,also any tips on
where to buy a good rebuilt motor or new motor, preferably here in colorado,
or, a place to buy the parts for the type 4, i cant seem to find a good
place to find/buy these parts

any help would be appriciated

Tyler
