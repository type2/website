Subject: Looking for a 79 Westy body

I am seeking to find in the southeast, a 79 westy body in good shape 
so that I can build the Mothership II.  I plan on using the original 
Mothership engine and some of the interior.

The body of the Mothership is in pretty sad shape.  Not that she is 
as bad a Dave Raistricks &quot;Itchigo&quot; but the bondo is separating and 
the rust is eating up the front nose...Time for a makeover...

I plan on doing another &quot;Search for the Beginning of Wind&quot; tour 
starting in Jan. 07 to celebrate my 50th birthday.  Gonna have to 
have a good bus to do it right.

Any help in finding a body would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for tolerating the &quot;proposed&quot; ramblings,

Charlie Ford
