Subject: Re: [T2] hole in Tin.

&gt; Bob, on my engine that was the hole for the temperature sender when  
&gt; it was buried underneath the tin.  I think the early years were  
&gt; like that.  I've got a CB engine that has that very same hole you  
&gt; describe.  I don't know its history, but I do know at one time, on  
&gt; some type IV engines, the head temperature sender was buried  
&gt; underneath the tin and in the head near the #3 sparkplug....a  
&gt; design that was fixed in later years.  Is it possible that your bus  
&gt; has early tin on it?

It was a design hold-over from the 411 engines. The early 72-75 bus  
tin used the same tin and used a rubber plug on the 72-74 dual carb  
models.

The 75 bus head needed a temp sender mount and re-used the earlier  
design. Karl took some photos of the 75 head a while back:
