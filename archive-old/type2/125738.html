Subject: Re: [T2] disabled bus

Hi,

Monster Garage recently did a conversion of a Mercedes SUV. Watching
that may give you some ideas on tricks to try in converting a Westy.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I own a 75 Westy with a manual trans.  Three years ago, I was in a car
&gt; accident (not in the bus) and I'm now a quadriplegic, unable to drive
stick 
&gt; shift.  I'm looking for advice on finding and adapting another Westy 
&gt; (automatic, obviously) for use by a disabled driver - I'd love a bug
at some 
&gt; point too.
