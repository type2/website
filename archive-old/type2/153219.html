Subject: Re: [T2] Part needed for T4 engine

Scott,  the engine will be complete when I get there. If 
for some reason, it doesn't get built by then, I obviously 
won't do the swap. It's 3 weeks away. The engine will be 
tested before it's installed. It's not going to be a crazy 
as you think.

Last year, at EveryBus, a guy blew an engine. Within 5 
hours of him blowing the engine, he had another in and was 
driving around.

I think we'll be alright. Maybe a item we forget, but we 
will NOT rush anything. I have spoken to the big man(my 
boss) and if the swap doesn't go like we plan, I have 
vacation days to use. Swweeet!!

Besides, I'll have about 200 Bus owners standing by with 
red cups. Ready to fill our ears and minds with ideas. 
Some good, some bad. lol This is being done at EveryBus. 
My engine now is a GEX. I figure we can tear it down for a 
lesson of &quot;Why not to buy GEX 101&quot;.

I'll keep you filled in. :)
