Ouch! :-(

&gt; On the face of it I need a new head and piston, but...
&gt; is there any way to check without too much trouble if anything else is
&gt; damaged?
&gt; Is it ok to simply replace one piston and leave the the other 3 alone?
&gt; What about the head: ok to touch one and not the other? (I'm pretty sure
&gt; that the PO replaced the other head about 15,000 miles ago) Is a used one an
&gt; option here or do they have to be mated?
&gt; Is this the time to think about a replacement engine--hurts to write that
&gt; since everything was going so well till then... Cost?
&gt; Anyone have advice on either where to go for parts or where to get a
&gt; reasonably priced replacement engine?  I'm in eastern Connecticut...  thanks
&gt; for any help here...

John,

The quote that springs immediately to mind is from Dirty Harry... &quot;Do you
feel lucky, punk?&quot;  As Bob said, there are those who have replaced very
minimal numbers of parts and gone thousands of miles on them.  Then there
are those who didn't.  An awful lot depends on your financial condition.
If you have the bux ($2000 +core), then Boston Bob (www.bostonengine_dot_com)
is close to you.  I have not bought one of his engines, but he has been
spoke well of on this list.  If you are a starving student, then replace
that head with a good used one (~$50-100)  and scrounge a piston and
cylinder from sopmeone with a broken set (~$50)  YOu *can* replace one
head or even one P&amp;C, if you have to.
