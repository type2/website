Subject: Über-Kamper survives first highway run!


&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I'd drop y'all a line to mention that the motor is now in the
&gt; Über-Kamper and it has survived it's first run. 60 miles from Erin to
&gt; Scarborough, 97% highway driving between 50 - 70 MPH. Since we didn't have
&gt; time to replace the fuel tank, I drove it home with the motor slurping
from
&gt; a 5-gallon outboard motor tank tied off to the spare tire well.
&gt;
&gt; Dennis  (Aka Denmeister) did a magnificent job of tweaking the engine, and
&gt; the fact that there wasn't any camping gear installed yet might also have
&gt; affected the acceleration (grin). There is still plenty of work to be
done,
&gt; but now that it's a running vehicle it'll be a lot easier. The brakes work
&gt; way better... No more &quot;ABS&quot; effect from the 73's warped front disk.
&gt;
&gt; A closer look at the motor says that for this season I'll probably
configure
&gt; the Bus without the pop-top, and put my effort into replacing the muffler,
&gt; erspacher furnace and heater boxes instead. The interior wiill get a
&gt; full-width Z-bed (ie, no closet) and the rear-facing seat may be replaced
&gt; with a pickup-truck style drop-down seat mounted to the wall behind the
&gt; driver. That way I can put swivels on both of the front seats. Next year
&gt; I'll put in the double-bed pop-top.
&gt;
&gt; Stay tuned to www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2
&lt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2&gt;
&gt; for more details, I'll try to get an update posted later today.
&gt;
&gt; This weekend's efforts will focus on gas-tank replacement, and removing
&gt; stuff from the 73 bus to distribute it  to needy list-members. (You know
who
&gt; you are...)
&gt;
&gt; Happy Friday,
&gt; (Made more so by the 3-day weekend we celebrate in Canada)
