&gt;  When this happens I shift to neutral and the creeping stops, however
&gt;it is difficult to move the shift lever out of gear and into neutral. It
&gt;takes significantly more effort and the shifter will balk before 'thunking'
&gt;out of gear. Then it will be very hard to shift into first, usually
&gt;impossible unless I muscle it into fourth gear first. After it goes into
&gt;fourth it shifts through all the gears smoothly until the next time I stop.

This symptom is typical of a pilot bearing worn out and grabbing the 
mainshaft. You didn't say you replaced it. You will have to do a re-do and 
remove the flywheel to replace this $2 bearing.
