&gt; I found a link a while back to an early-bay-westy owner's book (maybe
72?).
&gt; It was a complete set of scanned pages.  I thought I found it at
type2_dot_com,
&gt; but I don't see it there now.  Anyone know where it is?  I searched the
&gt; archives too, no luck.  It was in a section on a website that contained
lots
&gt; of publications.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have the same book for 1968?  I'd love a set of YOM books for my
&gt; glove box, but copies would be fine too.

Here is the 70 books.......
