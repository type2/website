&gt; Which is better... Rebuild your engine, buy a longblock, or buy a

and the definitive answer is,  &quot;that depends&quot;

time
money
skill

&gt; I have never a rebuilt a engine (VW or otherwise) but do belong to local
&gt; VW club and have some knowledgeable friends.  I am, however, fairly
&gt; mechanically inclined and am not afraid of doing the standard
&gt; maintenance, valve job, rebuilding a carb, replacing the odd part, and
&gt; doing the occasional body work (panels, patch, and paint).

it sounds like you have support net, if you can find one person who has
rebuilt a similar engine and you like how it runs can you bribe them
(bbeer, $$ whatever) to look over your shoulder and double check your work
for you. then you are good to go.


&gt; Time is the one thing that I have not had, recently, and that (along

not good, the first time will take much longer than you expect

&gt; with funds for other projects) has led me to the crossroad.  There are
&gt; so many vendors and options out there I would like to hear some feedback
&gt; from y'all with a good bit more experience than I.

NEVER EVER buy anything from GEX
AVP is mid line, decent quality, decent price

it seems almost universally that in the East get an engine from &quot;Boston
Bob&quot;
and in the West from &quot;Seattle Connecting rod&quot;

YMMV
