I thought I heard someone say:

&gt;since the purpose of the filter is to
&gt;remove hydrocarbons from the recirculated exhaust gasses,

Hmmm That's a new one on me....I *think* the idea  of the filter is to keep
little flakes of 'Stuff&quot; from clogging up the small EGR restriction at the
manifold....

For those *not* up on the nuances of the world of pollution control...EGR is
&quot;Exhaust Gas Recirculation&quot;
&quot;Gee! Like an *afterburner* right????&quot; 
Ummm no...(you can lose the visons of your bus looking like an F-14 leaving
the deck of the USS John F. Kennedy at night)
The atmosphere is 78 some-odd percent Nitrogen..and nitrogen is inert..it
doesn't combine with other &quot;stuff' too well...except under high temperature
and pressure....
high temp and press, eh?..like in the combustion chamber of my bus on any
given up-grade?
Yep..the same place...
We need to keep the temperature down in the combustion chamber.....we can do
that by putting less &quot;dynamite in the hole&quot;...if we fill up part of the air
volume in the cylinder with something that won't burn..like something that has
*already* burned..like a small bit of the *exhaust* gas...the total volume of
combustble material will be lower and, Hey! we just got ourselves a EGR
system!
...The intake of the exhaust into the manifold is shut off at an idle (it
really runs poorly with EGR at idle..*you* don't run with exhaust stuffed up
*your* nose) and it's also shut off at full power...to keep the intake temp
down.....
so the filter is ther to prevent gooing up of the works...
I'll bet it's a screen......

oh yeah..in the world of pollution it's called NO&quot;x&quot;...as the number of
oxygens can be..well..anything..and changing all the time..
one of them is Nitrous Oxide....(laughing gas)
*I* think they should make a system that changes *all* the exhaust to Nitrous
Oxide...wouldn't lower pollution, but who'd *CARE*???? Hole in the heaterbox?
*NO* problem....
(I crack myself up, sometimes) &lt;grin&gt;
