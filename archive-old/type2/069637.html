Subject: UNIX answers -- thanks

Hey all,
Thanks to all who answered my question.  The command was indeed chmod, which, when I remembered, smacked my forehead and said &quot;Duh!&quot;

I would have replied and thanked everyone privately, but lots of folks sent the correct answer, so here it is.

Thanks,
Sean
