Subject: Re: [T2] Blowing Blue- Sid is right on.

It's good? How would it be good? Sid is right on the money with his 
diagnosis. If VW had wanted something to push blue, they'd have left the 
valve stem seals out of the engine. Racing clearances? I build racing 
clearance type 1 engines, and they don't puff blue on startup. If anything, 
it's the valve stem seals worn, or the valve guides, allowing oil to slip 
by. Not a big deal if you aren't going through a quart of oil every 300 
miles, but a nuisance at times. Usually typical of an older motor, 
especially if it's parked on an angle.

====================================


 if
 anything, it's good (so long as it doesn't foul the plugs).
