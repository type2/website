&gt; Any one know of some Junkyards in North Carolina,
&gt; (northern) South Carolina
&gt; or Virginia for Bus parts.  I've got some leave I
&gt; want to take and do some
&gt; Junkyard hopping. I found one here that has a couple
&gt; of Bay Windows and one
&gt; VERY RUSTED Splitwindow that's been stripped.  Found
&gt; one in the Virginia
&gt; area that I'm going to get the AC out of and bought
&gt; a set of Dellorto's from
&gt; it last time.  It also has a Gene Berg shifter in
&gt; it.

  If you get up to the Richmond-Petersburg area of
Virginia you should stop by Mid-Atlantic vw parts and
restoration on US460 2.5mi east of 295 interchange. At
least 10-12 type 2's in boneyard and 8-10 for sale.
