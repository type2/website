Subject: Re: [T2]fuel shut off

&gt;Hey Craig,
&gt;I just read your page an noted the part at the end on the fuel shutoff
&gt;valve.  I think that's a great idea when you're working on stuff like
&gt;changing the fuel filter.  Where exactly did you place it in the line
&gt;and do you have any recommendations on where and what kind of valve to
&gt;get?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mike

I have a small brass shut-off valve just before the fuel hose broaches the
engine tin (I have a large hole that was formerly used for a/c hoses, so my
fuel line runs thru this in  some pipe insulation, several layers of rubber
and a brass brake grommet!). A short length of hose then attaches to a foot
or so of 1/4&quot; brake line; this then gets a short hose to the carb.
The metal line 'floats' above the intake manifold, and is a good 1/2&quot; away
from the distro,  all sparkplug and other engine wires. I have the valve
loosely ziptied to the reverse light wire; this keeps it up off of some
gauge wiring, prevents it from rattling around too much, but is not done in
a way to chafe either item. Put some rubber around both, to be sure.
To remove the engine, I shut off the valve, undo the hose clamp that
connects the flex to the metal line, and pull :)

I'm not really convinced this is the most elegant setup, but it will do
whilst I ponder the mechanics of it all some more............
