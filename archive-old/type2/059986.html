Subject: comment on FI hd temp sensor test/fix

Re changing out Ben Hirby's temp sensor:
Did you check the resistance of the sensor?
The temperature sensor should have been checked with an ohmeter....all it
is = a variable resistor based upon heat (betcha you can work out your own
temp scale by runnings reading to a meter on your dash!)  You can pull the
plug and run an ohmeter between plug and ground OR  read what the brain
gets between terminals 13 and ground (term 17).
 14 deg= 7,000 to 12,000 ohms  (brain gives more gas=richer!)
 68 deg= 2,000-3000 ohms
186 deg =300 ohms   (probably has no resistance at fully hot!!)

If no reading (infinity), you have an open circuit (check for good ground,
or sensor is shot); if it shoots up (full continuity=0 ohms) you have a
direct short and run way too lean before warmup.   If it's a gonner you can
even wire in a Radioshack variable resistor and dial in your own reading
(higher the resistance, richer the mix).
-As to removal, I remember braizing one socket on top of the other to
create a &quot;piggyback&quot; socket tall enough to get the sensor out with the wire
balled up in the cavity of the upper socket!   I wouldn't heat the area up-
get the right socket on what's left, using a SIX sided socket, and try
percussion or a long enough handle- try a sliding T-handle, which lets you
torque in opposite directions even with an extension on the
socket....Rounding off sockets is due either to tipping it as torque is
applied or using a 12pt socket on a stubborn hex....
