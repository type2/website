&gt; Within reason, does it really matter what dizzy goes with what fuel

What really matters is that the fuel delivery system has an appropriate 
(ported) vacuum port for a vacuum advance distributor, and (maybe) an 
appropriate (manifold) vacuum port for a vacuum advance distributor 
that also has a vacuum retard.

The stock distributor on Stevie's Bus had vacuum advance, and he also 
indicated that the fuel delivery system has (currently capped) vacuum 
ports.

So, I would say that an SVDA would work fine, just make sure to hook 
the advance up to the correct vacuum source (ported vacuum).

I would not hesitate to recommend an SVDA.  I am very happy with the 
one I installed in my 2L FI (with Pertronix).
