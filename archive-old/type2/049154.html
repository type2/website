Subject: [T2] Head gasket or metal to metal

Hello list,
I am replacing the head on my 78 Westy (2000cc HL)this
weekend and have a couple of questions for those who
are knowledgeable on the subject.

First, I am using AVP heads I bought through
busdepot_dot_com(looks great and arrived early). I have
been told by a local VW shop that the most recent
specs call for the head to be installed without a
gasket (i.e. metal to metal). This runs contrary to
what I know about engines but hey I am open minded. 
Any advise?

Second, I would like to hear the pros and cons of
replacing the heads with the engine in(any worldly
advise that would help me avoid pitfalls would be nice
as well).  

Finally, will I need to do anything special with the
hydrolic lifters when I install them?  Should I clean
them in a solvent before I replace them.  

Thanks in advance 
Rick
