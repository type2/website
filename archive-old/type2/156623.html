This must be a &quot;YMMV&quot; thing.  I made an all-thread puller and it worked
easily.  I'm really allegic to pulling out the BFH, particularly when I
have to hammer upward in a restricted space.  Much easier to pull both
bushings down out of the bottom of the bore with a leverage tool.

Perhaps it has something to do with how well the bushings were greased and
how rusty things are.
