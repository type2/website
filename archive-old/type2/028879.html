The switch was the same '68-'70 and then changed in '71 and stayed the same
till '79. We sold used ones for $21.99, but if you found new ones for $20
then we'll change the price to $10 for the used ones.

Subject: [T2] headlight switch


I’ve got a 1970 that I’m doing some restoration on and I’ve run into a
minor problem/query.
Is it possible to use a &lt;1971 headlight switch with a 1970 bus?  The PO
had installed
such a switch and I’m curious how different the two are.

The later model one is like this:


                            I (58b)

                 I (58L)                I (56)


                         I         I (58)
                 (30)   I

                                    I (X)

                           I (58R)

As I’ve been rewiring everything I noticed that the #s on my wiring
diagram didn’t match up
with this switch.  Can I still use it or should I splurge on that new
20$ switch?
