Subject: get together in Leesburg

I know I saw a message on this list about a get together in Leesburg, VA
on next Saturday but I can't find the message anywhere. Whoever posted
it could you please email me or post it again. I don't remember where in
Leesburg it was I just remember it said 11am-til?

TIA
Sharon
