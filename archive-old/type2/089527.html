Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Sender


I once used one of the dip stick senders on a bug.  Wasnt really 
comfortable after some things i had heard about them.  I put an oil temp 
sender in the sump plate and got way different readings.  tested the 
sender from the sump and found it accurate.  Had an engine on a stand at 
the time and did some temp readings at various locations and under 
various conditions.  Have never used a dip stick sender since.  Note 
this is not to say they are bad.  They are definately better than 
nothing.
