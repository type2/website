Subject: [T2] '73 fuel tank venting

Hi all,

Does a 73 have the same venting for the tank as a '72?
 You all confirmed my thoughts that the bus originally
came with a type IV, but carbureted.  I'm looking into
purchasing a '73 with no engine, but the owner is
giving me the option to purchase a fresh Type IV FI
engine with the bus.  Other than the additional return
vent, do the gas tanks differ at all?  The engine is a
'79 FI.  Just wondering what my options are for the
gas tank.  Right now, I see three options: Leave it in
cuz they're the same, plug up the charcoal vent and
drill and install a vent for the FI setup, or replace
tank entirely with one out of the right era (what is
that, '75-'79?)

TIA!

Paul
