Subject: Re: New carb woes...

Thanks all, much food for thought...

I know the ignition is fine as I was running it for a few weeks before 
swapping the carb.  There are no leaks on the flow bowl, it's just not 
filling up to the Bentley levels, but swapping the gaskets did raise it 
a little.

I'm gonna rebush the old carb as when I stripped it down yesterday it 
already has removable bushes - is this normal - everyone talks about 
reaming old casing etc.  This will not be required on my carb, just make 
up some new bushes and fit.  The casing and shaft measure no wear of out 
of round, but when I swapped the linkage side bush for the pump side 
bush the shaft felt better, so there must be wear on the linkage side 
bush - makes sense.

One step at a time...

I was thinking fuel pump too, but I'll do the carb rebuild first and see 
what happens.
