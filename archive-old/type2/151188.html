Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Brake Servo

&amp;gt; Okay did alittle searching on the archives but didn't really come up with
&amp;gt; a good answer.

Archives are hard for me to search too, because I don't know how, but trust
that everything IS in there.

&amp;gt; Got a type2 with a bad brake servo(might not be the servo but I already
&amp;gt; bought it and seeing how these seem to be a failure point, I might as well
&amp;gt; replace it)

Everything has a failure point, but servos aren't short lived compared to some
parts.
My only thought is that you could test it and perhaps use the $ on needed
parts.

Servo initial test:

Take off the master cylinder, insert a piece of cardboard or something into
the hole that can reach the bottom of the inside of the servo.  If there is
more than 1/2&amp;quot; of fluid coming up the dipstick, then it is likely that your MC
has been leaking brake fluid enough to compromise the servo's diaphram.  If
not, why not change the MC (_at_ $20 for Brazilian) and see what happens?

&amp;gt; will I need to bleed the brakes after installing

If you disconnect any of the brake fluid lines during the process, then yes.

&amp;gt; Are there seals which I will need to replace when re-attaching the
&amp;gt; master cylinder?

No reason not to put a new O-ring on the MC.

&amp;gt; The adjustment is all I am worried about.

Do you have the green Bentley manual yet?  It's required reading.
