Subject: Re: fuel tank needed

Gentlepersons-
                       Luckily, I haven't had to pull the tank on my Bus yet, 
but for what it's
worth, I did my Bugeye's tank with the POR-15 cleaner and sealer at least ten 
years
ago and also sealed the outside with POR-15 paint...So far no leaks, with 
lots of just
sitting in the garage time.
