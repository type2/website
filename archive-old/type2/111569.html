&gt; Hey Non-starters,

&gt; Don't forget the archives (library too?) for Steve Dolan's short list
&gt; on how to start any bus, type1/4 carb/fi, in an emergency situation.

The link is:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/098182.html

There are a couple points where I would differ.  On an absolutely unknown
engine, I would adjust the valves to .008 rather than .006.  They might
clatter, but they would run and there would be no chance of burning them.
I would also insist on 15&quot; of vacuum. 10&quot; will get the engine running,
but it would not idle there and would overheat in short order.

I am surprised this is not in your library but I could not find it there.

&gt; Search for the term &quot;procedure&quot; and Steve's name in the archives and
&gt; you should find it.

It was the fifth article for me searching &quot;dolan procedure.&quot;  You can move
it to the top by searching for &quot;dolan procedure basic engine&quot;  Searching
effectively is a definite art.  It would be helpful if the person in
charge of the archive would set up a pick box for &quot;search only in
(subject/body)&quot; and if the summaries displayed did not start at the
beginning of the header.  They are bloody useless for selecting posts as
they are.

                             OOK!
