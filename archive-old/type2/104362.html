Subject: Steve Dolan Sighting

There's been mention on the list lately that Steve Dolan hasn't been 
posting much of late.

Well, I caught sight of him this weekend -- well, it helped that I 
showed up at his house -- and he's duly busy working on (which is to 
say, swearing at) his house.  

In between all of this dilligent cauking and whatnot, he found the time to 
help me free a brake adjusting star and loan me the tools to change my oil 
and adjust my valves (my tools are in my '67, which is a long 
story).

Hope everyone had a good weekend.
