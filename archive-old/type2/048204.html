&gt; &gt; quite a bit of difference, a manual starter CANNOT be used in a manual.

 Huh???  Don't you mean &quot; a manual starter CANNOT be used in a automatic''?

 You CAN use the self-supprting automatic starter in 1700 and 1800 manual
trans buses. You CANNOT use it in a 2.0L manual trans bus.


&gt;  &gt; it has a self supported Bendix gear, there is no nose cone on the
starter
&gt; &gt; or tranny.   the auto starter is minimally stronger (1/10 hp more)
