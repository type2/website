Hi again gang. First I want to say &quot;Thanks!!!&quot; to those of you who responded to
my request for a fuse box cover. Still haven't found one but at least people are
looking. The next item I need is a headlight switch for a 71 bus(pre-August.)
I just received a new one from Ron and was surprised to find out that:
#1) It takes a different size retainer nut.
and
#2) It doesn't have a terminal 57. Red/black wire attaches here.
No problem. I decide to gut my old switch and swap parts with the new one to
make it compatible. Bad idea. Not only did I destroy my old switch, which only
needed a new rheostat, I also managed to destroy the case on the new switch.
Didn't realize that the pot metal was so fragile. So I once again turn to the
all knowing and helpful list to see if anyone knows of a supplier of the correct
switch, or to see if anyone has a good used one of the right vintage that they
would be willing to part with. The part # off my switch is 211-941-531. The new
one that doesn't work is 211-941-531E. Thanks in advance for all replies.
