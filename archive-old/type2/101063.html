Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching the panel vinyl.

Don,

You can use a number of things, but some work better than others.

The panel and the vinyl will have &quot;dry&quot; flakey stuff on it that you need
to get off by brushing or vacuming well.

Then you can either use 3m weatherstrip or the spray &quot;headliner and carpet 
glue&quot;.  The guy at my local upholstery shop says the stuff he uses(spray 
or paint on) is better than the flaps spray.  If you buy the spray stuff 
at the local flaps, make sure it is &quot;heavy duty headliner and carpet 
adhesive&quot; in the tall can...not the other stuff in the short can.

3m weatherstrip will hold well, but you need to be able to spread it out 
well cause it may end up looking lumpy.

Plan on several clamps to hold while drying....lay it in the sun first so 
that the vinyl is nice and stretchy.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I just purchased a 78' Bus.  It's not a Westy top, but a Riviera (I think
&gt; that what is called).  I have been looking for one for a long time and
&gt; finally found it!  We are super excited about it.  I am now the 4th owner.
&gt; The previous owners all named her &quot;Bess&quot; I will be continuing the tradition.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is that the vinyl on the passenger door and the rear has come
&gt; unglued.  The vinyl is still in great shape, there are no cuts.  It just
&gt; appears to have come unglued.  Any ideas on the best way to reattach it?
&gt; 
&gt; I have another question, the weather stripping for the pop top is coming off
&gt; and the only replacement I see for sale is for the Westy top.  Can I use
&gt; that as well?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for the input!
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, the 78 bus runs good, I have to take it in for a smog test this
&gt; weekend. Hopefully it will pass.  Since it is a 78, I only have one more
&gt; year in California until the bus is 25 years old, then I will not have to
&gt; smog it again.
