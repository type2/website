Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

 be ready to
&gt; actuate that sub-routine in which you deliberately steer where you
&gt; normally wouldn't, even if likely to roll, to stay out of a head-on.
&gt;

Yes, Unca Robt. ;-)

I've avoided many accidents that way. Never rolled though.

Here in CO, I have to drive over two overpasses on the way to work. In
winter they are almost always a sheet of ice. If I'm inattentive (or
still asleep) I can forget that bit and not slow down before hitting
the ice. And in order to miss the people stopped on the bridge I've
ended up with two wheels in the grassy median to stop. Works
beautifully.

One thing I can absolutely recommend:

Find an empty parking lot and put your bus through its paces. Try to
break the rear end loose and learn what that feels like. If you live
in snow areas, do it dry and in snow. I did this when I got here in CO
because it had been years since I'd driven in snow, and never with a
vehicle like a bus. The bus will give you signs when you're pushing
the limits, and if you learn to recognize them when you're not under
pressure, you'll be better prepared to deal with them when you are.

Sweat now or bleed later.
