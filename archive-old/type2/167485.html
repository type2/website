well the engine is mostly the same, have replaced most vacuum lines,
waiting for some odd sizes to be delivered. but phutzing with the lines
seems to have no effect

&gt; Re-trace all your plug wires and check your timing and vacuum advance,
&gt; y'know, basic stuff.

&gt; Do you smell fuel?

pretty much normal, when trying to start it smells of being flooded but
when running no. and I had fuel presure guage set up and it was factory
spec
