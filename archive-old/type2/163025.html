Subject: Hydraulic lifters and oil pressure

I had my first date with a type4 a few days ago, so bear with the newbie.

Here is the situation : 40 minute of bench/driveway idling/revving on
engine rebuilt by one of the usual discount rebuilders in SoCal. About
2 miles on the engine.

Here are the symptoms

* Oil pressure light comes on at slow idle. That is for instance when
I let the clutch out on first gear and slowly take off. Then engine
does not die when the light comes on, it is just revving slower than
at idle without load.

* Oil pressure light takes 2-3 seconds to come off after the engine
starts firing. We tested two oil pressure senders with similar
results.

* 3 out of 8 hydraulic lifters are soft. They feel like they have air
in. Valve train is loud. Interestingly the valve train is quiet when
engine is cold and it becomes noisy when warmed up.

So what's up ? Can a somewhat low oil pressure fail to get the lifters
pumped up ? Why in the hell is the oil light coming on at low idle
while it wasn't doing this _before_ the complete rebuilt. On my type1
(rebuilt by me) the oil light comes on only if the engine stops, any
slow-as-a-dead idle keeps it off.

We will hook up a oil pressure gauge tonite and keep you posted.
Bentley says 42psi at 2500 rpm, how about idle oil pressure ?

Type 4 with hydraulic lifters

30WT oil
