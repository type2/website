I pulled the engine after work today to get to the torque converter seal. Sure
enough, as I sat looking at it, it oozed fluid once I pulled off the torque
converter. 

I haven't gotten the new seal yet from Bus Depot but this thing is clearly a
different animal from the engine seals. Rather than hard rubber or plastic,
it's metal and red rubber. I'm reluctant to go after it with a screw driver.
How do you pull this thing?
