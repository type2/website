Subject: RE: [T2] Installing Bus Depot Mudflaps on a 78.

&gt;What do the flaps and brackets look like?

Thanks for the pictures Richard.  These look like they would make a huge
difference in installation.  Here is what the brackets that I have look
like.

And here is a scan of the instructions.  Don't worry if the scan looks bad,
that is what the instructions look like.

According to the instructions the bracket looks like it is incorrect and it
is way too long to install in the manner that is specified in the
instructions.  

Hopefully someone can help with other ideas or brackets,
