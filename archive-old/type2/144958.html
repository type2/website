&gt; &gt; Lower priced timing lights are &quot;listed&quot; with a +- 2 degree accuracy...the
&gt; &gt; more expensive ones talk about +- 1 degree.
&gt;
&gt; ...never knew this, but that explains it.
&gt;
&gt; I make xenon flashers for oceanographic recovery and warning applications,
&gt; If I take several exact units, same exact settings, etc, and power them up
&gt; at the exact same time with the one power supply, not one unit will flash at
&gt; the same rate as another unit due to the different tolerances in the
&gt; components in each unit. I'm sure this also applies to timing lights as
&gt; well.

Perhaps not.  The strobe flashers have their own time base and their
strobe rate is probably not critical.  A timing light gets its signal from
the ignition.  What we are debating here is whether there is a time delay
between the high voltage signal in the ignition and the flash of the
flasher.

Even if a cheaper timing light has a delay, it would probably be
consistant.  Compare it against a known standard and figure out the
correction factor!
