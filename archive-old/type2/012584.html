A little nugget from RAMVA

This was recently printed in a newspaper in Colorado - FYI


By Charles T. Jones

Woodland Park based Rocky Mountain Motor Words Inc. is under investigation
by federal postan inspectors who are &quot;looing into allegations&quot; that the
company &quot;knowingly and intentionally has been selling counterfeit Volkswagen
merchandise&quot;.

The investigation originated witha complaint from VWoA last year to the U.S.
Attorney's office in Denver, and came to light ina Jan. 2 letter sent to
current and former employees of the company from U.S. Postal Inspector
George Andrews.

Company officials and their attorneys refused to comment for this report.

The probe isbeing condicted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the
U.S. Attorney's office.

&quot;There's no issue that they were selling items that were not licensed&quot;,
Andrews told The Courier. &quot; The part that makes it a crive would be if they
were knowingly and intentionally doing so. What we're trying to find out is
what kind of conversations have gone on concerning this isue, if any.&quot;

Andrews said that his office still is receiving responses from potential
witnesses.

Meanwhile, he stressed that the company may well have inadvertently sold
unlicenses merchandise, such as VW monikered floor mats and T-shirts. he
said the company and it's lawyers are cooperating in the investigation.

&quot;We've gotten nothing but absolute cooperation from RMMW. They've been very
open, and extremely cooperative in this investigation&quot;, Andrews said. &quot;And
the law firm that they've hired up here in Denver to represent them in this
matter has been extremely cooperative&quot;.

&quot;They want to know, and that's usually an indication that... there may not
be any wrongdoing. But I'm not a judge and jury, Than God, I don't have to
make the decision of whether cases are prosecuted or not; I just turn it
over to the U.S. Attorney's office, and they make that decision.

Meanwhile, the company announced last month that it has hired a new
president, Lee Meyer, former president of Current Inc. and PaperDirect Inc,
both Colorado Springs based catalog and direct-marketing companies.

On Jan 2 Andres asked current and former company employees to come forward
with any information they may have that could shed light on VW's allegations
and the subsequent federal probe.

&quot;We realize this could be an uncomfortable situation for a current employee
or even a former employee with family or friends still working there&quot;, the
postal inspector wrote on Jan 2.

&quot;We are sending you a brief questionnaire which simply asks if you wish to
speak with us concerning theis matter. We will not bother you again if you
indicate you do not wish to discuss this.&quot;

A postage-aid questionnaire was attached, which stressed, &quot;You.. are not
being investigated. We are contacting you because you may have information
as a witness&quot;.

&quot;I've got a stack that says 'yes&quot; and I've got a stack that says 'no'. But
they are still coming in. I'm getting quite a few daily,&quot; Andrews said.

&quot;If we've missed someone, I'd be more than happy to talk ot anyone,&quot; he
said. The 24-hour Postal Inspection Service Number is (303) 313-5320.

&quot;I'have to be, and the U.S. Attorney's office certainly is very aware that
to put someone through- if you actually charge them - it's extremely costly
to defend themselves. So, we don't do it lightly. And we won't put that
company throught all of that without believing our case can be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt&quot;.

Andrews said that VWoA is bound, under the federal Lanham Act, to vigorously
protect it's trademarks and patents, or risk losing exclusive rights to
them.

And Volkswagen is tenacious about protecting it's trademarks and patents,
Andrews said.

He said the federal probe stemmed from an internal investigation by VWoA,
whos representatives made &quot;test purchases&quot; of allegedly unlicensed VW
merchandise from RMMW, 1003 Tamarac Parkway.

RMMW supplies replacement parts and accessories for VW and BMW to busineses
and individuals. It bills itself as having &quot;The Largest Selection of Parts
and Accessories for VWs on the Planet&quot;. 

(SIDE NOTE: why are &quot;VW&quot; and &quot;Planet&quot; mentioned in a federal investigation?  What
kinda gig you running down there, Everett?)

VWs case against RMMW was presented to federal prsecutors in Denver, who
turned it over to postal inspectors about six months ago, Andrews said.
