Subject: 72' bus hitch

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 72' bus and would like to find a hitch for it. I've looked into =
the one sold by The Bus Depot but they'er not sure if it works with an =
Empi Dual Exhaust. I was hoping someone has done this before and could =
give me some advice. If there is another supplier that might have a =
better product, that would be nice too.=20

Thanks
Mike
