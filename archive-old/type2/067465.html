Subject: How/why did i get my 1st bus

     I'm one of the late 40's age group on this list.  I grew up in 
     Cleveland.  In the 50's my Dad had a commercial laundry downtown and 
     used a fleet of VW panel busses to pickup and deliver to his smaller 
     customers (mostly houses of ill-repute).  On weekends he would bring 
     one home so we could go to the drive-in movies (in the summer of 
     course).  He'd park it sideways and kick open the cargo doors.  He and 
     Mom would sit in lounge chairs in the back facing the screen and watch 
     from there.  Us kids would sit on the ground on blankets.  I loved 
     those busses.  They were blue and had the laundry name painted on the 
     sides.
     
     In the late 60's I traded a '56 Les Paul Custom for a '42 Harley 
     flathead.  I drove that bike for years all year round.  When I got 
     married and my first son came around, we needed four wheels.  I traded 
     the Harley for a '61 T-bird and a '56 VW Panel van, just like the one 
     my old man had.  Couldn't resist.  
     
     We practically raised that boy in the old bus.  We were landscaping 
     for a living and would put his playpen in the back, parking where we 
     could keep an eye on him.  I have one photo of it, from the back, and 
     it has rust in the same places my current bus has.  Imagine that!
