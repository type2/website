Subject: Rear Hatch Screens are Back!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Rear Hatch Mosquito Screens for '72-79 Westfalias are available again!  They
allow you to keep your rear hatch open when camping, and snap into place
using the stock snap recepticles on your Westy.  They are original-look
repros. These screens were unavailable for quite some time.

I'll be ordering them on Monday.   If a few list members are interested, I
can get the price down to $49.95, which is about $15 off the regular price.
If you'd like me to order you a set, please e-mail me (to my personal
address, ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com) by Monday.

Sorry, no availability of ''68-71 hatch screens at this point (slightly
smaller hatch), although Vanagon ones are available.

Thanks,
