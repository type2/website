Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb 32/36 DFEV

Hi Lee,

A suggestion made to me by my local VW parts shop (Bow Wow), was to cut
a piece of tin to fit between the carb and the manifold, and to drill
small holes in it, until I could get it to run right. This is
essentially a restrictor plate like they run at NASCAR. I didn't get to
try this, as I discovered other problems with that bus that kept me from
getting it to run right.

- Mark
