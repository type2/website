Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

And this is a subject a another wrench friend of mine and I were talking
about a couple of days ago--

In days of yore--the vehicle would start running bad--which was a sigh
of points miss firing, until it eventually stopped on the side of some
oblique road n the middle of no where.
The solution was simple--

Take outa book of matches--use the emery board on the matchbook to clean
up the points--double up on the cover of the matches which would give
you about 0.19 gap, tighten them down and down the road you went--

Today you call a truck--their ain't no way around it--no more quick, on
the side of the road, in field repairs--

But I will say an electronic HEI set up does give you a hot spark, and
with no variation in the angle or dwell for a long period of time with
zero maintenance.

It's a wash--( except when you get the tow bill-)--:&gt;)

A Magneto is the only way to fly--
No radio reception within a 4 block area--but bg voltage--very hot
spark--pretty reliable

Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message   
 
Perhaps I am the exception to the rule, but I will swear by my Crane
CDI. 
Indeed, if you do want to change at least buy a quality brand name.
Crane has a great rep for ignition systems. As long as they aren't
making them with indentured peasants in Asia now, either that or Mallory
is where I would look. You won't get them for $19.95 and you won't get
10% to 30% better mileage, however, in an otherwise stock T-IV. Neither
can you put in stock points and get home without a tow bill when they
fail, which because of their quality construction might be 10 or 15
years of perfection until nada, and there you is where you is, at the
side of the road, waiting for a tow truck.
