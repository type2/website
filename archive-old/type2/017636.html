I don't know about putting the beam from a '71 under a '67, but we
toyed with the idea of putting a later model disc break system onto an
earlier bus and were told that it really wasn't advisable, unless you
had access to a welder and were *very* mechanical(or you wanted to pay
the BIG bucks).  It could be done, but it was a pretty involved job...

&gt; Someone told me that the front beam from a early Baywindow will fit under a
&gt; 67 . I would like , if possible , to put the disk brakes set up from my 71
&gt; westy parts bus under my 67 westy. Is this possible?
