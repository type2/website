     The second sender I got (the first one was way too big to fit in
the sump plate -- there is only one *very* exact place it can go in that
plate because of the way the case is up behind it) came with a nice thin
nut to go on the other side of the plate. I too had to use silicon to
stop the leaks -- and I don't think that trying to thread the sender
into that plate is a good idea, although you could weld a washer or
something on the outside, then thread the thicker material. But BusBoys
sell the real VDO sump plate replacement.
