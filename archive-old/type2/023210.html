&gt;All,
&gt;1) Is there a good place I could see some pictures of a type 2 bus's 
&gt;engine in good shape?
====================&gt;
Try me at:
http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/newbus2.htm

&gt;2) I am in the process of removing my starter, does anyone know where the 
&gt;2nd screw is that I need to take off to remove the starter? I got the 
&gt;electrical part off as well as the screw under the bus. But I cant find 
&gt;the 2nd screw.
===============================&gt;
Reach way behind the fan housing in the engine compartment.
As you sit on your haunches looking at the engine, it will be on the right 
side, then located behind the fan area, way back in the darkness.
You may have to move your oil bath air cleaner in order to get proper 
access to it.
It is hard to find and reach, but once you find it, you will remember.
Removing it is usually a 2 man job, since you can't be 2 places at once.

&gt;3) There is a part that looks like a black can that has a few latches on 
&gt;it. It has two vents that face towards the back of the bus. It also has a 
&gt;tube that runs to the top of my carburetor. Can anyone tell me what this 
&gt;is? I would think it was the air filter but it has quite a bit of oil inside.
===================&gt;
See above answer........ Yes, it is your oil bath air cleaner.

&gt;4) Last question for now. Next to the oil cap there is a pipe that runs 
&gt;down under the bus to nowhere the other part of the tube attaches to a 
&gt;hose that goes to the part described in question number 3.
===================&gt;
There is an oil vapor breather return line that goes to the oil bath air 
filter.
This must be what you see, but not sure about all else asked here.
