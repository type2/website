Subject: [T2] ARRL Field Day

I know, a strange posting title to most.........
however,
there are more than just a few hams out there who have VW campers, so ....

June 23, 24, 2001

I will be, most likely, somewhere above the Northern California border, and 
along the coast during this time frame.
Anybody out there interested in meeting up with me for a camper bus/ham FD 
event?
I will have quite a bit of gear with me so as to allow for a complete 
station setup.

I will be looking for that &quot;perfect&quot; spot to run some wires, camp for the 
weekend, let Mary Beth read her books, and maybe fix a few campsite meals 
for her N5RP.

If I run an amplifier, I'll be looking for a sight with AC power.
(If there is still any left out there, by then)
