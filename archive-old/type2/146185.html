&gt;Where is the bolt for the oil pump?  Are you suggesting that I try to turn
&gt;it to see if it's loose?

I meant to say oil pickup. The bolt is between the inner push rod tubes.

&gt;I guess I understand what can go wrong... I don't understand how to verify
&gt;if its gone bad already and what to do next if it did - besides a rebuild.

What are you going to do if you find out that it's broken? Tear down the engine or keep driving?
