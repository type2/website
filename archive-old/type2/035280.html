Subject: Reliability of Busses

I've never had anything but a VW bus for a daily driver. I've always
considered them reliable.  I've been stranded a couple of times, it's true;
but only with recently accquired vehicles which had been checked out yet.
And I've been driving these things since my first vehicle, a 66 Kombi, in
1968.
