Subject: '70 Vs '77 Drivability impressions

I have had a '70 for 25 years. I just recently purchased a '77. 

I have found the '70 much easier to drive. The power band seems much wider
(1600 sp), it is much easier to shift (just slides into each gear) and has
a smoother ride. Clutch action is more smooth and linear ('77 seems to have
a digital clutch). This is all with over 300k miles.

Of course, the big plus for the '77 is the FI, which makes it easy to start
and go, and the power is much higher when you get the rpms high enough. But
it is hard to shift, clutch is either in or out (seems to be no inbetween),
and you have to rev it very high inorder to keep it from bogging down in
the next gear. Also a very bouncy ride (with new shocks). The gas pedal is
hard to push (well lubed and adjusted).

My question, is my perception reality or could my '77 be poorly maintained.

Thanks
John
