I installed the new starter, and now my engine will turn over, but not
start. I still have no headlights or parking lights. The fusebox is a mess.
The plastic is split from one end to the other, the fuses aren't exactly
tight. The 3rd fuse holder looks like it has melted before. I ran to the
junkyard, and they only had a '69 with 10 fuses, instead of a '70 with 12
fuses. Anyone know where I can locate a fusebox for a '70. Or is there
anyway to replace it with something better? I'm searching the archives
tonight, but so far no luck.
