Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Delima, No power up front.

I am looking at it now. I guess I might have missed something. I might have 
fudged up something at the starter, but I put it all back like it came off. 
I just cleaned it all. If the two spade connectos were swapped could it 
cause this problem?

I really think this might have something to do with the Air Conditioning 
removal. Do you think there was or is a main power feed to the fuse block 
that I disconnected? One that would run through the AC system? The big black 
wire that is hanging down from the fuse block, looks like it reaches right 
up to the headlight switch in a natural way. I looked at the switch and all 
terminals are connected except for one of the #30 terminals? Could this be 
where it goes?

&gt;Hello Michael   There is a wiring diagrahm in the library .  Check to make
&gt;sure that you hooked all the wires up at the starter. Sounds like you 
&gt;missed one
&gt;  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
