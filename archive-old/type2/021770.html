Subject: Re: [T2] What is it with the 009?

What problems have you had with the vacuum advance?  You could just
disconnect the vacuum line and then you've got the same thing as an
009.  If you've still got problems, then something's wrong with the
centrifugal advance, not the vacuum.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Before I go on, Thomas Tarka's post about his 009 is prompting me to write
&gt; this&gt;snip&lt;Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  I don't get it,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't get it either, but from the other direction. I am running an 009 on
&gt; my 74 1.8ltr and it does quite well. Good power and acceleration, no
&gt; unexpected trouble on hills, etc, etc. I am planning to re-install the stock
&gt; vacuum dizzy after I repair my carb to make a comparison, so maybe then I'll
&gt; understand.
&gt; 
&gt; My thinking is that while the 009 may not be perfect, I have never failed to
&gt; get an air cooled VW to run with one. Can't say the same for the vacuum
&gt; dizzies, but my experience may be somewhat limited.
&gt; 
&gt; My two kroner worth.
