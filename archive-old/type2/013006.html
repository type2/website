Bill,

Thanks for the tip.  The information Bus Depot had on
my 82 Westy diesel was better than I could get from a
VW dealer.  Their prices were a little higher than
Carlsen's, but only by 7% and shipping will probably
be a lot less.  In true Bus Depot form, the
information they had on my 85 Jetta diesel was very
sketchy and incomplete.  They only had 2 of the many
hoses I need for the Jetta.  But hey, the Jetta isn't
a bus.

Rob

&gt; The closest you can come to a good dealer is bus
