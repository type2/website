Hey listies,

I solved two of my problems today. I think a vaccum leak was causing my #4 
cylinder to seem like it was inactive. That's fixed so I'm running on all 
4 again. I did the timing right with a tach dwell and strobe light and the 
advance seems to work.( I'm running this with amechanical only and would 
prefer to keep it that way for the sake of simplicity) Any strong 
objections? Also today I somehow overcame the flashing oil light syndrome 
and power loss. I changed the oil with 20W50. Maybe the other adjustments 
helped somehow??   I still have a big oil leak and the engine is pretty 
damm hot after a short test run. I remember bending the dipstick sleve 
when installing the motor. The leak comes from the area around the 
alternater where the rbber bootie thing hooks on and the suspect dipstick. 
I t leaks alot whenever the engine is running. Any common leak spots known 
of there.

Thanks to all the responses whether they were accurate or not they helped 
my thinking process. Here I am with a practically roadworthy bus.

Anyway thanks to                                I
