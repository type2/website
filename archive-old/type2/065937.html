Subject: Dick Morris at VWoA?

I know there are jokes just waiting to be sprung on this newsworthy
event. Just listening to Paul Harvey over the noon hour - he announced
that Dick Morris ( you know the guy - Clinton's former advisor) has been
hired by Volkswagen as Head (?) of Public Relations. I don't know what
else to say - other than VWs are going to have to be designed with a lot
more back seat space in the future ;)
