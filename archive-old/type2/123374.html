Subject: Burned Valves: Why? Update

Hello all,
  I recently asked the list about my valve damage problem in my GEX motor 
(2L, hydraulic lifters), and I got several replies suggesting that GEX may 
not have used the proper components in my valve train.  I talked with 
somebody recently who had supplied GEX with some cores (a lot of them) in 
exchange for some finished motors, and from his findings he said that that 
an incorrect valve train is very possible.  I also forgot to mention that 
when I inspect/adjust my valves the adjusters are almost always beat to 
hell.  How can I tell if I have the proper cam for my engine in there, and 
proper pushrods and rockers?  I have access to a dial indicator for checking 
the cam, but I dont know what the rise of the cam is supposed to be.  Is 
that the same as lift?  Is the lift of the solid cam different than the 
hydraulic cam?  Are the pushrod lengths the same?  Rocker ratios?  Thanks 
for any help on this project!
