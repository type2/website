Subject: Fridge magnet

Just got my BusDepot order in, well half of it anyway.  They must have gone
fast.  I ordered right after Ron posted about them!  Will my key chain
eventually come in, Ron?

The magnet is rather neat.  No VW insignia on the front, but a really nice
representation of a bay bus, roughly 2&quot; L x 3/4&quot; W x 7/8&quot; H (50mm x 20mm x
23mm).  Hollow, too, as well as brass of some sort.
