Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake adjusting stars

Or even better, I would recommend buying several (like all 8) new ones, so
that you can replace the old ones.  Mine were so banged up that the &quot;stars&quot;
were more likes &quot;stubbies&quot;.  It wasn't very expensive, and it CERTAINLY made
it easier to adjust the next time!!!

I then kept a few of the old ones in convenient locations (where I won't
lose them) so that whenever I have to adjust the brakes I have one to look
at so that I can figure out which way to turn.

&gt; Hello Christopher &amp; list       What you do is buy you a star adjuster with
&gt; the screw and keep in your tool box. When  you go to adjust the brakes use
&gt; this to see which way to turn.        Mark Dearing    Salem Import Service
