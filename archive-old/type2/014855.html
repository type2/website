Hi Stephen,

I read with much interest your &quot;rant on welding heater box flanges&quot; as I am 
contemplating the same thing later this summer.  I also have a new welder and 
figure that this is something that I should be able to do.  My thoughts were 
to only tack the flanges in place while the heater boxes and exhaust system 
is mounted on the bus.  Then I could take it all off and have much better 
access to the areas that need welding.  Maybe this is what you tried.  I 
really haven't given this too much thought so far, but now I am a bit 
concerned by your troubles.  I hope you get things sorted out.  Those d*mn 
donuts are a royal pain.
