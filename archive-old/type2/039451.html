Bucket,
The problem with no idle when cold on an FI engine may be due to an air leak 
in the hose that connects the AFM to the auxiliary air valve.
At least that was my experience a few year's ago. The engine ran fine when 
warm, but it had a very slow idle and poor power when first started. I got 
around it for a while by increasing the idle speed screw, but that was not 
fully satisfactory. I traced the problem to the connection of the air hose 
to the auxilliary valve proper, adding a clamp to solve it. It is logical 
that if there is an air leak in that circuit, the AFM won't measure that 
air, and the result is a too lean mixture. Once the auxiliary air valve 
closes when the engine is warm, the mixture problem is automatically 
corrected. So, make sure the hose that splits off the main air way to the 
throttle valve and which goes to the auxiliary air valve (located 
approximately over cylinder #2) is solid and all the connections in that 
pathway air tight. If that doesn't do it, maybe a sensor has gone out of 
spec, but I haven't experienced that to know the symptoms.
