Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Filler tube gasket

on 6/2/03 10:56, you related:

i hope it doesn't seem like i am picking on you theodore, but i have to take
issue with a few of your points:

&gt; use the thin stuff as that is what the
&gt; original looks like, dont use cork or anything thicker than regular paper.

the filler tube gasket is actually quite thick, as gaskets go, maybe about
0.030&quot;. it is made from the green waxy type of gasket material, impregnated
paper of some sort. regular paper gasket is not the right thing for this
location at all.


&gt; Then when you put the new gasket on use a
&gt; little high temp RTV sealant.

again, not the right idea, IMO.

RTV should not be used in the crankcase anywhere, there is a high likelihood
of globs of it getting into the oil passages and this can destroy the motor.
a little silicone grease helps the gasket stay put in assembly and will
never do damage. if you must use sealant, use permatex or hylomar in very
very small amounts. but you shouldn't need it.
