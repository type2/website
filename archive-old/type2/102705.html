John,

First....grab it! Learn to use it. Just don't learn to use it on the
body panels of your bus. It sounds like your dad has a SMAW welder.

The SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding, better known as &quot;stick&quot; welding)
process is an age-old process compared to many of the newer welding
processes...but still a skill (and tool) well worth having. Even if it's
just to build that bus rotisserie of your dreams. :) The SMAW machines
are generally the lowest priced (at the consumer/nonprofessional level of
equipment) vs the other processes.

The SMAW process uses a solid metal (of various sorts depending on what
you're using it for) &quot;stick&quot; of metal that has a hard almost ceramic-like
coating on the outside of it. It might remind you of a really
thick sparkler... The stick get's charged with electrical current (AC,
DC, positive, negative..all depends on your welder and situation). The
work piece is connected to the other electrical lead from the welder. As
the two pieces come in contact they create a spark. By maintaining the
proper distance from the workpiece the electricity flows in an &quot;arc&quot;
across the gap. This arc of electricity melts the metal of both the stick
and the workpiece.

When you're welding with this stick you have to manually advance the
&quot;stick&quot; towards your welding surface. When you run out of rod you have to
replace it. As you're welding the heat from the arc burns the hard
&quot;shield&quot; off of the stick, creating a shield around the arc. This shield
keeps the oxygen out and keeps the weld from getting to hot.

SMAW requires a fair amount of skill to do well...so you may want to pick
up a book or two on the subject. Once you're REALLY good you may find
that you really can weld thin sheet metal, such as your buses bodywork,
with your welder. Or maybe you'll find that a GMAW welder is more your
style. :)

Some more information on the SMAW process can be found here:

If you need to weld bus body panels immediately you may want to pickup a
GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding) welder (better known as a MIG). This type of
welding process uses a metal wire that is usually fed from a spool.
Again, this uses electrical current to produce an &quot;arc&quot; between your wire
and your workpiece. This time your wire is fed toward the workpiece for
you and you can weld longer without replacing your wire.

The shield in this process comes from a gas that is fed through the welder
to your &quot;torch.&quot; The gas is blown over the arc for the same purpose as
above, to keep the oxygen away. Without this shield your arc will burn
hotter and be harder to control. With steel the shielding gas is usually
CO2 or a CO2/Argon mix. When welding aluminum the gas of choice is
usually pure Argon.

The GMAW process is usually recommended for sheet metal and thinner gauge
metals.


Next you have FCAW. This is very similar to the GMAW process but doesn't
need a bottle of gas or a gas regulator. This makes even a good FCAW
machine fairly cheap when compared to an equivelent GMAW machine. This
process uses the same wirefeed setup as the GMAW but instead of a gas
shield the wire has a central core of &quot;flux.&quot; When the the metal melts in
the arc this flux burns and creates a shield for the arc. FCAW is
particularly good over GMAW in situations such as high winds where your
gas shield would just get blown away. FCAW is generally a much &quot;dirtier&quot;
weld then GMAW.

For more information on GMAW and FCAW you could read this article:

http://www.thefabricator_dot_com/xp/Fabricator/Articles/Welding/Article186/Article186_p1.xml



TIG welding, or the GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) process, is similar to
stick welding with the added bonus of a gas shield. I'm only slightly
familar with the TIG process since I cannot afford a TIG machine. They're
more expensive then any other that I've covered in this email.

The GTAW process uses a tungsten electrode that is charged with electrical
current. This electrode is used to create the &quot;arc&quot; and a gas shield is
blown over this arc. Next an unshield metal rod is fed into this arc by
hand (this process usually requires three hands or more..). The rod and
workpiece are then melted by the arc. This is different from the GMAW,
FCAW, and SMAW processes since in those processes your metal wire/rod is
also your electrode.

A bit more information about the GTAW process is here:

And now i'll shush up. :)
