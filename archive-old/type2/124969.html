Subject: Re: [T2] Engine seized...

Here is Tom Slider's nice page for looking up your crankcase with the engine 
code. Don't forget many times a mismatched fan shroud will be used so don't 
go by the in your face stamp when you open the engine lid (on the fan 
shroud). Behind the fan shroud on the case is the actual block stamp.

Tom also has a lot of other good info on the type 4 motor throughout the 
rest of his site.

&quot;Can anybody give me a short/sweet
heads up on type 4 motors so that I can tell the differences (block numbers 
etc..) between the various types of type 4 motors?&quot;
