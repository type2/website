If you gently stretch from the point opposite the split and work toward the
split, your gap will disappear.  There should never be a gap at the seam and
you should correctly re-install it if your gap is under the pulley...then
flagellate yourself or wear a horsehair shirt inside out for 1 hour ;-)

&gt; Porbably obvious for most, but for whatever reason i installed mine so
that
&gt; the seal was donw under the cooling fan. You can never get the ends to
meet,
&gt; so there's always a little gap - best that the gap not be directly under
the
&gt; fan, where it will suck in hot exhaust/heated air.

I've got about a 2&quot; gap in my '79.  I thought it might be prudent to fill
that with something, as well as plug a few
smaller openings I can see when looking down thru the hatch.  Good idea or
overkill?
