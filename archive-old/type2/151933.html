&gt; Thanks Tim! I concur on Death Valley. just what I wanna do, spend the day
&gt; in 120 degree heat with the scorpions, snakes and tarantulas with such

well it was only 102 the day I was there and never saw any scorpions,
snakes or tarantulas..

&gt; glorious (read &quot;zero&quot;) scenery in an air cooled vehicle! Not to mention

well since I had flown into Las Vegas for a meeting I had rental car and
1. it wasn't air cooled,
2. it was air conditioned
3. it would go a lot faster than 65mph

&gt; I get. Just me I guess. Read many of Abbey's books which were great but when I'm in the desert I don't get it anyway...
&gt; We had no problem with crowds when camping or hiking and the people
&gt; we ran into in fact were terrific in regards to the bus (lovingly restored
&gt; by Chris F. before I bought it I add). Many &quot;ole hippies&quot; struck up long
&gt; conversations with us not only at The Canyon but every other place we
&gt; stopped. Including a park ranger who missed hers back in Vermont but was
&gt; planning on bringing it out the following season after an engine rebuild.

unfortunately since I was in a bright red Ch*vy and not my bus, no one
knew I was an &quot;old hippie&quot;

&gt; I hope to follow suit on your hikes down the interior with my hiking pal of
&gt; 20 years later this year.

wish I could do the Bright Angel trail but maybe just maybe I will someday
get to take a boat (not a raft) thru the Canyon....(the way Gen Powell did
it)

&gt; Anybody out there got any extra almond/white camper T moulding they wanna
&gt; get rid of?

try &quot;Outwater_dot_com&quot;
