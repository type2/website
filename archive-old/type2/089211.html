Subject: Re: [T2] Gap between steering wheel and column. Why?

Easy answer:
The wiper/turn signal housing and assembly has slid down the column.

Not an easy fix:
You have to loosen the locking bolt, raise the assembly back up, retighten the
bolt. Sounds easy but.....the bolt is an anti-theft device. It was originally
a shear bolt. When you tightened it the head sheared off. Now you have a
problem. There is no head to put a tool on. If you look at the bottom left of
the housing, you will see a hole. In that hole is a broken off bolt. You will
need a narrow sharp chisel, just to fit in the hole, and a replacement allen
head bolt. 8 x 1.25 x about 25mm long. Get a big hammer and hit the chisel to
make a slot in the end of the bolt. You need a big enough slot to get a
screwdriver to unscrew the bolt out. It does work.....  Now replace it with
the allen bolt. Slide the assembly up to within a 2-3 mm gap and tighten the
bolt.

&gt; The other day while pulling my steering wheel off and cleaning the contacts
&gt; on my turn signal switch, I noticed that when I put the steering wheel back
&gt; on, the wheel did not slide all the way down the shaft. It slides over the
&gt; splines and appears to rest comfortably on the enlarged portion of the
&gt; shaft. I realized that this was the way I got my bus and that this was the
&gt; reason why my horn didn't work, and why the turn signal cancellor (sp?)
&gt; wasn't working either. The horn button contact was not making hitting the
&gt; contact on the top of the signal/wiper switch and the cancellor is not
&gt; hitting the switch either...
&gt; There's about a half-inch gap where the wheel doesn't appear to go all the
&gt; way to the column, but I know for a fact that it is as far down on the shaft
&gt; as it will go!
&gt; So I fixed the horn temporarily by flexing the horn contact, but my
&gt; cancellor wont work until I figure this one out...any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
