&gt; I pretty much agree that I'd expect people to pay for materials. I've

to

&gt; my stuff. I would expect to pay if the situation were reversed.
&gt; Short term loan maybe. Same with the fund. Don't borrow if you can't
pay
&gt; back.
&gt; How's that sound?

I really don't want the list to become a financial organization.  It
seems that the handling of money causes more animosity and hard
feelings than anything else.  Most of us have a Visa card or somesuch
that will float us a $1000 loan if we need it.  Those who don't are
the &quot;special case&quot; that might prompt us to pass the hat.

A loan fund would just about invite abuse.  While the list has a heart
of gold, any group of 1000 people will have a few bad eggs that would
milk the system.  Better to let people be responsible for their own
finances and to handle the true hardship cases informally.

The primary purpose of the list is to disseminate information, and it
does this very well.  Let's go with our strengths and not tie
ourselves up by trying to do too many functions.
