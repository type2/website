Subject: Vanagon advice needed

Hi there all,

I've been looking for a late '70's or early '80's westy, at this point
I'm really leaning towards the vanagons, I really like their interior. 
 What I've found is an 80 vanagon, very little rust, mint interior and
just about everything new or rebuilt. This thing runs and drives great!
This is the first Type 4 I've ran. It also had the fuel inj. replaced
with dual webers, is that a plus or minus? Well to get to the main point
here- when the bus idles it seems to have a knock, rev the engine
slightly and its gone. It's not a pounding rap, just a knock but it
still bothers me. Are type 4's generally noisy? My feeling is that it's
probably ok but I'd hate throw a rod or spin a bearing a week from now.
I have the price down to $2300. what do ya think?

Thanks in advance,
RJ.
