Subject: Best camper top?

     Yeah, a Friday topic I guess.  I really like the sportsmobile tops, so 
much in fact that I'm transferring one from a rusted out sportsmobile I 
parted out onto my 73 westy.  I recently saw a hightop that Barry B. was 
driving around, though, and now I'm not so sure.  The hightop is nice!  They 
both seem to offer more room than the westy wedge.  Is there a _best_ camper 
top?  Does it really matter?  Any plusses and minuses that folks can offer 
up?
