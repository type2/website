Subject: [T2] What engine to make/buy/build

Right Mrwhipy is now out of mothballs &amp; had a great time _at_ Vanfest last
W/end. Just before we went I fitted a oil temp dipstick, the one that makes
the oil light flicker &amp; then stay on when the heat gets too much. Within 10
mins on the road doing 50ish the light comes on only goes out when I have
dropped to 30 for 10-15 mins. Are these dip sticks any good? I have no
problem if the engine needs an overhaul (look forward to it!) but what the
input of you guys on the oil temp &amp; should I re-build the upright 1600dp or
go for a 1776cc with machined P'n'C's or try &amp; get a 2000cc type 4 pancake
instead.

Please can you pmail me to nishikigoi_at_btinternet_dot_com as I am having probs
with the PC.

Andrew, Denise, Cameron &amp; twinkle in my eye ;)
