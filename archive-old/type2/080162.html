Subject: Re: Stud removal

Snoopy (and list)-

I recently did the same thing, and judging by the responses
I must have been lucky. Basically what I did was use liquid
wrench, clamp the vice grips on and voila!... didn't budge!
Then I used a propane torch to heat the head all around
the stud... maybe for 30 seconds. Keep the torch
moving. The idea here is you are expanding the AL and
hence the hole. Let it sit for about 10 sec, tried the vice
grips again and out it came, smooth as buttah.

I, being a bear of very little brain, would say try it, but
if it doesn't work after one shot, see your machinist and
your rabbi, in that order.
