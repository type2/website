Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion (Wasserleaker)

&amp;gt; They ride nice-- really nice for a van (I don't call them busses)-- and
have plenty of room, for sure. 
&amp;gt; A vanagon might be ok for someone with the skill Mark, but I sure as
hell don't miss my vanagone. 
&amp;gt; Good riddance.  

Remember, there are air-cooled, and diesel Vanagons.  Let's not paint
them all as wasserleakers  - in fact I have one for sale.   

As to the name &amp;quot;Bus&amp;quot; for Vanagon - I believe it's common outside of the
US to call the T3 a Bus.  Just about every German I have had at my work
(plenty) refers to the T3 as a Bus., although because of the name
Vanagon, I (and we in the states) tend to think of the T3 as a VW van
more than a VW Bus.

Happy trails,
