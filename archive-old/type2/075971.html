Subject: 76 teardown and ignition lock removal

Been out of town for a couple days.  Having recently
corrupted both my daughters into believing that the VW
van is the world's most perfect (and most fun) vehicle
and &quot;camping out&quot; in the driveway in our &quot;new&quot; 74
westy, I returned to check my inbox stuffed full of
digests.  

And I have to thank you all.  That 76 teardown thread
is a wealth of information from some of the best minds
in the business!  And the thorough pictures on the
lock teardown website!  I don't know how I could hope
to maintain a 30 year old vehicle without this list. 
Thanks all!
