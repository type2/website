Subject: Re: [T2] AC

Brings to mind a classic line:  &quot;Aunt Bea, call the man!&quot;
  
  I used to sell auto parts to local shops.  When R-12 started going  up wildly in price and shops were learning how to do the conversions,  our company put on some conversion seminars.  I didn't get too  involved in the technical aspect but at the minimum it meant draining  all of the oil out of the compressor, new receiver dryer, vacuuming out  the system, and replacing the oil with somthing R-134 compatible,  etc.  
  
  But out in the marketplace I found all kinds of crap being sold.   Some of them were actually propane based.  And people were paying  licensed repair shops to put it in.  Some of them did work pretty  well by just blowing it in on top of the R-12.  But it's illegal  and dangerous.
  
  Even if you do take it to a shop, ask a lot of questions.  Make  sure they are actually doing all of the things necessary to make your  system use R-134A.  That's the only thing legal and safe.  Or  it was back then.  Maybe something new and improved has come out  but I'd want to know a lot about it before I let someone put it in my  vehicles.  JMHO.  Cheers....KR

I side with Karl.  There are a couple of good reasons
why non-trained persons should not work on AC.  At the
top of the list is the fact that R12 is killing the
Ozone layer.  (And converting to R134a involves more
than just draining the R12 and replacing it.  And,
R134a requires addition of a special oil.  Not to
mension the expansion valve and dryer modifications
which should be made when converting from R12 to
R134a.)
