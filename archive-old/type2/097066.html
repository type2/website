Subject: heater flap seals

     Yesterday morning I asked about the foam material to use to replace my
heater control flap seals on my 87 westy.  Someone responded on either the
Vanagon or type2 list but my computer crashed &amp; I lost the message.  If the
person who emailed me could resend, I would be in their debt.  Thanks.
