&gt;while digging out the lower cabinet in the west i
&gt;found a bunch of tools, hoo ya!!  and i came upon a
&gt;light that has two microswitches and room for 3, 12
&gt;volt bulbs of the dome light type.  it is about 7
&gt;inches long and has a broken white cover for it.
&gt;where does it go in the bus and could someone please
&gt;send me a pic of theirs mounted?

It mounts on the interior, driver side, centered above the window in the 
passenger compartment.

Do you need a new lens to replace your broken one?
