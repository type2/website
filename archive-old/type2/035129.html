 Hi again...

economy.
&gt;  I don't enjoy driving it, but it does do it's job.

&gt; ...  But it's doesn't
&gt; lose it's value like a modern vehicle, and parts are mostly cheap -
&gt; (depreciation? what's that ?)..

 I figure the low depreciation offsets the fuel cost: I worked out
a while back that I'd have to be doing over 30,000 miles a year
for the difference in fuel costs to exceed the difference in 
depreciation.

 On your other point (enjoying driving), I can't see myself sinking 
thousands of pounds into a thing that I get no pleasure out of, nor
wasting my time driving a vehicle that's a chore.
 Time spent driving my bus, like my 911, is not time wasted. Time spent
behind the wheel of a Toyota (say) is gone forever... Money I can make
more of, time is a little harder to come by.

Cheers,
	W.
