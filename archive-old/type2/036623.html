HUMBLE APOLOGIES:

SORRY!!! I AM AN IDIOT! From the inside, you push the door handle
FIF-ward to OPEN the door, RIR-ward to secure it and lock it. I'm gonna
get a lot of mail on this (smacking my forehead).

OK, now that that's out of the way, you should *never slam your sliding
door.* This is a Bad Thing. I was told this early and often, and I have
internalized it well.

Sounds like something's severely tweaked in your door mechanism. I'm
told the outside handle in the closed position is *supposed to be*
parallel to the ground (9:00 o'clock). Mine's kinda about 8:50, so the
mechanic let it go. So you *are* pulling up, just not from the normal
starting position. Sounds like a job for an expert (not me, I apparently
don't know my RIR from my elbow).

There originally was a two-ended inside door handle on the Westy, I'm
told through 74. It has an extension that points up. Apparently, in 75
they changed the design so you don't have to contort to open the door.

&gt; inside, I need to..
&gt; 1. slam the door
&gt; 2. pull the handle (pointing down to 6 o'clock) towards the rear (3 o'clock).
&gt; 
&gt; Can't make it lock though. That little lock thing never lets me move
&gt; it. Not a wiggle!
&gt; 
&gt;  From the outside:
&gt; 1. slam door.
&gt; 2. raise handle (points at the 7 o'clock) rearward (10 o'clock position)

*****

&gt; I have that too! I have to skinny my hand between the ice box &amp; the
&gt; door to reach the handle.. are you saying there IS an easier way to
&gt; do this???
