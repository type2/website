Last week my son's 78 Champagne Edition bus popped a fuel line, caught fire
and became a charred hulk. We've subsequently picked up an 84 Vanagon GL as
a replacement, and therefore have some T2 stuff left.

1. 1969 Campmobile interior. Rear seat &amp; cushon, closet, table, step stool
and driver's side seat/cabinet. - $125.

2. 1978 Champagne Edition 2 passenger middle seat. Great condition. $75.00

If interested, e-mail.
