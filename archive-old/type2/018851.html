Ken:

I was corrected on this one the other night by David H. in GB: His pop-top is a
Devon conversion, not the Dormobile as I'd guessed when he sent me the link to his
pride and joy (beautiful bus!). Similar, but different. Unfortunately, I don't
have his link handy. I did find this example of a Devon conversion with a
side-opening roof: http://www.svaha_dot_com/~vw/graphics/pairdevonmoon.jpeg
(&quot;Pair of '79 Devon Moonrakers&quot; at http://www.svaha_dot_com/~vw/vwindex.html)

Learn something new every day....

&gt; The only conversion we've ever heard of on the list whose top opens from
&gt; the side is a Dormobile. Is the flexible part made of vinyl, and does it
&gt; have a scalloped appearance when open?
