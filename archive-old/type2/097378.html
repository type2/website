Subject: Re: [T2] knobs, knobs, and more knobs

[...]

&gt; My Beetle had a nice pull switch that was OEM VW. I think it may have come
&gt; from a Westy camper from the early 70's. In the Westy I believe it
&gt; controlled the rear dome light? On my Beetle I used it for a switch to
&gt; control an aux reverse light as my Beetle had none. Looked nice, worked
&gt; nice. I was a newbie and making the OEM reverse lights work was beyond me.
&gt; Simple system in retrospect.
&gt;
&gt; If you find the part# would you pass it to me. I have to find the same
critter.

I just happen to have an early bay rear dome light switch in my hand...   On
it is part number 111 955 511B.
A while back someone asked for one so when I saw an early bay at the yards, I
grabbed the switch. That person never replied back to me. So if any one else
wants this switch, pmail back.
