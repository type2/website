Subject: the yellow or the white wire?

Hi,

I have a 76 westy, and am trying to hook up my driving lights. They need
to be spliced into the highbeam or lowbeam wire to the headlights, but I
don't know which is which. 

Technically, your supposed to wire driving lights to only come on when
your high beams are on, legally, and fog when your lowbeams are on....

Anyone know which is which? Im pretty close to just splicing into one of
them, and seeing which setting they end up turning on with. 

Christopher
