&gt;I need to replace my heads on my 1979 Fi because I just got a compression

&gt;this operation.

It's easier than you think. Pulling the engine, that is.

The REAL problem is when you have to take almost everything else apart
in order to pull the head. Well, okay, not everything else, but the
intake and a lot of the tin etc.
