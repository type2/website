Subject: Re: wheels

&gt; My stock wheels are pretty rusty. I thought about getting these
&gt; sandblasted then painted,

The rims of my '77 Westy were rather rusty and spoiling the looks my
otherwise quite decent vehicle.
What I did was:

- had the tires taken off
- had them sandblasted and powder coated (silver, plus clearcoat)
- tires remounted and balanced.

For 5 wheels the cost was approx $175 including about $50 for the
mounting/remounting/balancing etc.

I was very pleased with the results. I'm sure they now look better than they
ever did when new. The powder coating makes them look like they are made of
alloy. I don't think that any other treatment will produce the same results.
