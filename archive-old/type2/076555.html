Subject: Florida Bus People

Hey Florida Bus People!
I just moved to sunny S. Fl (Palm Beach) from dusty Aridzona and was wondering if I had any VW neighbors...
I was also wondering if any listees are going to either of these two shows in the Tampa area this weekend.   Sorry if this topic has allready been covered.
