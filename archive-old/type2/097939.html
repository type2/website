Subject: Re: [T2] Rear hatch water leak help needed

In a message dated 12/16/02 8:53:31 AM, vgonman_at_msn_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; On my 76, I have replaced the seal around the rear hatch, for it leaks 
water

in there when it rains.  After new seal installed, it still leaks on the

flat part between the striker and the engine cover..............I adjusted

the striker to make the door close a little better, and still no luck.  It

still leaks.  Any one else been thru this?

 &gt;&gt;

'Tho the hatch seal is probably the culprit, also check the window seal...
Mine leaked and ran down the inside of the hatch and puddled up on the
shelf.
