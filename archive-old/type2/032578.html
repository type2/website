Jeff;

There is absolutely no excuse for your insurance company taking over a month 
to get an adjuster out to you and start the ball rolling to get your claim 
sorted out.

I'd suggest you contact your state's Insurance Commissioner and register a 
complaint.  THEN call the insurance company and tell them what you've done and 


why.  If that doesn't move them immediately, it's definitely time to be 
talking to an attorney.

Good luck, and don't let them stall you or jerk you around any longer.

Thank you

I will keep that in mind.

Still waiting for the adjuster to look at my damage for the accident I was in 
a
month ago.
Peace brother

&gt; I don't know about the type 4 engine, but the 1600 crankshaft is easily
&gt; damaged in rear end impacts.
&gt;
&gt; In one such instance in my experience, the crank was very slightly bent and
&gt; wasn't discovered until engine heating became a problem.  The engine was
&gt; carefully inspected before the bus went to the body shop, and passed with
&gt; flying colors.
&gt;
&gt; When cool the engine ran and sounded fine, but when fully warmed up,
&gt; especially when pulling a big load or grade, the crank would bind and the
&gt; engine overheated very quickly.
&gt;
&gt; And there was no apparent external damage to the engine - the crank pulley
&gt; took the hit but didn't appear damaged even after disassembly and 
inspection.
&gt;
&gt; If there's any possibility anything bumped that engine, I'd make very sure 
the
&gt; insurance adjuster clearly comprehends the possibility of expensive engine
&gt; repair or replacement.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Also, before you assume your '73 engine is still good, you might want to
&gt; test that theory. Rear ending can cause engine and tranny damage. It can 
cause
&gt; the case to get hammered and become useless. It can also ram the input shaft
&gt; into the tranny...either damaging the tranny or breaking the input shaft or
&gt; the input shaft circlip, which can be replaced without TOO much fuss. It
&gt; depends on how the impact occurred.  &lt;&lt;
