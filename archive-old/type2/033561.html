Subject: Westy for Sale in Northern Wisconsin

Dear List,

While winter van-camping in NW Wisconsin ran into a van for sale at a
local auto shop.  Looks fairly nice by late night street light and my
flashlight.  Called the number on shops front after returning home and
got the following information:
1972 Westy with 1974 engine (saw dual carbs).  New valves, generator,
something about heads -the secretary who took the message just wrote
&quot;heads&quot;.  For sale by someone without a phone .... but you can call
stephen at 715-373-5460.  Asking $3,500.  

I called because I hoped it had a blown trans, engine or other part I had
handy and possibly could be had cheap .... just thought someone on the
list might be interested.
