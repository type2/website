I'm hoping to get this engine done soon :)  I have some time off, and spent
this weekend advancing my welding technology and other projects.

Anyway -- I am trying to put together a thermostat system from parts I've
collected... but it has been over a year since I took these apart and
painted them, so knowing how they go back together is another deal.

Is this how the thermostat rod hooks up to the flaps:

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ThermoRod02.jpg &lt;-- Thermostat rod flaps
closed

A diagram I have shows putting a washer or something on the end, but I can't
figure out how you are supposed to do that?  Is there something that you are
supposed to snap to the end of the rod to keep it from coming out of the
hoop?

And one last photo, I put my rod on book, I don't have a proper ruler I can
find :)  It is only slightly wider than my 1963-1967 Bentley book.  

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ThermoRod03.jpg &lt;-- Rod shape referenced on
book.

When I install all this, no matter how I adjust the bracket, the thermostat
is being pushed too far up.  In other words, when engine is stone cold the
flaps are still open about 80% of the way.

Any help appreciated.
