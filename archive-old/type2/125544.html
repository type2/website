Subject: Bus getting harder and harder to start!

   I have been blessed with a relatively trouble free Bus for a while now, so I really can't complain too much.  We made it to EveryBus 2004 and back without a a scratch, and the little puppy we adopted there (we named her Every!) has almost doubled in size. (Still working on that housebreaking thing...) Anyway, my '78 Bus has been getting more and more difficult to start, and then when it does start it wants to die out right away.  This only happens with the first start of the day after sitting all night (or day); if I go drive around, shut her off and then come back after I'm done whatever I'm doing, she starts fine.  My mechanic has told me the spark plugs are good, the points are set fine, the cold start valve is not it.  I can't say that I've personally checked all these things, but I trust this guy, especially since he never charges me a dime unless he can find out what's wrong and fix it.  But I sense that the collective knowledge of the List might be greater than his on this, and certainly greater than mine, since I know next to nothing.  What is another likely culprit for the hard starts?  I was able to get it going yesterday by just flooring the gas and revving the engine, which I know is NOT GOOD, but I had to get my kids to school.  Help!  Thanks, Beth in NJ
