No, both driveshaft came off first. As you apply force thru the puller using
a wrench the shaft wants to rotate because it's off the car.

&gt; part of the CV Jnt is resting on the vise.  Make sure that you remove
&gt; the large snapring.  May help to heat both and see if you can suck some
&gt; wax in there.  Get a sledge hammer and find anything to act as a punch
&gt; to beat on the axle itself.  Conversely, make a slide hammer rig by
&gt; taking a weight lifting weight and sliding it on the axle against the
&gt; serrated center of the joint if one CV is off..  This requires a vise
&gt; that really can grip the axle.  Heck, I've separated them by using TWO
&gt; sledges tapped on opposite sides.

Unfortunately I have a vice or work table so it's off to a friends house for
help. Thanks.
