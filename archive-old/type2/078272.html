Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

&gt; &gt;-silicone spray on the seal
&gt;
&gt;Roofing tar provides an assembly lubricant and a perpetual sealing material.
&gt;Brush into the glass / rubber channel as well as the metal window frame.
&gt;It cleans up with mineral spirits or kerosene. It's also cheap. And a popular
&gt;favorite over on the vintagebus list .

That explains the tar looking material I have seem barely peeking out from 
under a rubber seal... Was doing a good job apparently.

By the way you can also get roofing tar type materials from the big home 
improvement centers in squeeze tubes and in caulking tubes. Might make 
application easier.
