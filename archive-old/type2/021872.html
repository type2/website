&gt; Hey,
&gt;          First off I just came upon your page and it is very well done. I 
&gt; recently bought some property in southern-central OR. and will be relocating 
&gt; there at some point.
&gt;          The reason for this letter is that I have come across a 75 Riviera 
&gt; and retrived the pop-top material, bottom of &quot;X&quot; plastic rollers, and pop-top 
&gt; interior trim (see pic) since I cannot find anyone locally with interest in 
&gt; it I am fowarding the info along to you. It is in GOOD condition and 
&gt; reasonably priced. Someone you know must need it? Let me know.
&gt;                       Bill
