Subject: Oil Stat source for your external oil cooler project

Chrysler Vans use an &quot;H&quot; valve (the generic name) on their transmission 
coolers that uses 7/16 ID plumbing. The opening temp of the Stat I believe 
it is 140 degrees.

Should be a FLAPS sourced item.

Now you know what I know. The one I bought way back when was a CB 
Performance valve. It was okay but I like local OEM sources.

I'm sure the opening temp could be tweaked a bit.
