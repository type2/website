Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Column parts

From Jon:

I am in the process of putting my steering back together on my 68 DC
restoration.

In the exploded view of the steering column (Bentley Chapter 2, Page 27, fig 9-12) it shows 13 as &quot;seal&quot;. I
have taken apart a few of these columns and have never seen a seal at the lower part of the column tube.

If there is supposed to be one, does it sit on outside or the inside of the
column tube?

Is it NLA? I haven't been able to track one down in any parts catalog.

Does anyone have one or know of a good home-grown replacement?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no clue as to where Bentley got that pic of a column.
The ETKA and my old 68-71 parts catalog shows the same column pictured here:

Now the split bus column shows a seal, but they call it a gasket:

# 43.... part number 211 415 617

The VW dealers show it as NLA, but Bus Depot shows it as a Rubber Mounting, Steering Tube but I doubt they
have one in stock.

Is it the same as the Bentley # 13?  Not a clue.....
