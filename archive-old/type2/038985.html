Subject: Pilot Bearing Removed!

Greetings,

I'm not sure if anyone will find this information useful, but hopefully it
will end up in the archives.

I was having a difficult time locating a Pilot Bearing puller in my area and
the &quot;make your own&quot; version out of bolts and washers didn't work either.
I'm sure I didn't have the right type/size of washers, but they just bent
when attempting to remove the bearing.

Here's what I did:  Used a shop grade paper towel (blue ones) covered in
clean multi-purpose grease.  Shoved it into the pilot bearing/crank hole and
used a bolt slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the pilot bearing
to pound it in.  Only took a few whacks and the pilot bearing was forced
out!

I'm sure others know about this trick and as usual I'm the last to learn!
Hope it helps someone out.

By the way, I've got my website published with pics of my bus.  Check it
out, the link to the pics is at the bottom of the VW Bus Stuff page.  The
pics are pretty big, sorry, I'll work on getting them thumb nailed.  Sign my
guest book to let me know what you think.
