There is a guy here in the Seattle area who would be a good
contact for parts for you....
http://www.thebusco_dot_com
Ken Madson
   Great guy, full of energy an flush with parts!

As to the thread that has been running.... here on the left
coast we get a number of smiles and peace signs an
&quot;conversations at the gas pump&quot; experiences.... I have to
say none have ever been a bad experience or an irritant.
Maybe its due to the large number of splitties an bays
still on the road here. As to the kids wanting to talk to
us about our bus.... irritating?  AAhhh how quickly we
forget!

stock original.  It was found in the Washington State 
Desert and has been 
parked since 69.
