Subject: Re: [T2] AVP problems

Just did a little checking about these bolts that hold the fan. Looked at my
75 bus that has a 78 engine, It has regular bolts. my memory tells my the
original 1800 had the recessed bolts. who knos if that was the original fan
or not? I do recall ordering a fan from a salvage yard and specifying that I
wouldn't accept it if the bolts that hold the fan on didn't come with it. I
think I did that because both the 75 and 78 fans had broken blades and
different bolts.

Checked my bay window Bentley (copyright 1979) section 5 page 23 first
paragraph says, &quot;Torque the bolts that hold the fan with crankshaft pulley
on it's hub to 2.0 mkg (14 ft. lb.). On page 5-22 there is a picture (figure
7-6) of a fan with recessed bolts and what looks like a plastic or rubber
part in the middle of the fan to make it more aerodynamic. (?) The
description  says, &quot;Socket head screws that hold the fan with crankshaft
pulley on engines that do not have an air pump.&quot; On page 5-24 figure 8-2
there is an illustration of an enging that has no airpump, Uses standard
headed bolts, no plastic or rubber part in the middle, and is machined flat
in the area around the hole in the middle of the fan.

I think Bentley failed to explain that after the air injection pump pulley
was fazed out the fan remained the same, Without the recessed bolts. I
wonder if the more aerodynamic look of the earlier fan actualy helped the
fan have a greater cfm or if it just looked cool?

&gt;
&gt; The difference is the 73-74 model years.  During those years the center
&gt; surface of the fan was machined flat so that the air pump drive assembly
&gt; could be bolted on top of it.  This also required the use of regular
&gt; (non-recessed-head) bolts of slightly longer length.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the speculative part - I am pretty sure I've seen recessed
&gt; allen-head bolts holding the fan on in 1972 model year busses.  Not sure
&gt; about 75-later, but it wouldn't suprise me if a) the CV joint bolts were
&gt; exactly the same spec, and b) VW decided to use those after 1974 to attach
&gt; the fan to reduce the number of different fasteners required to build a
&gt; bus.
