       Actually, Todd, it's against the law to make even one copy of a
manual. You can copy parts of it, not the whole thing. And making a bunch of
copies of, say, chapter 4, to distribute to others, is also a no-no.
Teachers and professors can usually get permission to make multiple copies
of certain sections, but only for use in their classes, and not the whole
book or magazine. OTOH, places like Kinko's which were copying parts of
books and selling them to students got nailed big-time recently.
      And just because it's out of print means nothing. The copyright is in
full effect for 50 years, I believe. And some publishers pay a bounty to
people who turn in copyright infringements. Some software companies, for
instance, pay $800 to anyone who turns in their employer or some other
business for illegally copying software.
