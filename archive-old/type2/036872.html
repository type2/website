Subject: Re: Dual Kadrons and other goodies

Ted and the List,

What kind of cam are you running?  If stock, go with the 1.4 ratio rockers.  
Gotta friend running those with dual Weber 34s and extractor exhaust.  It's 
about the same as my 1600 with dual Kadron's, Engle 110 cam (w/1.1 rockers) 
and extractor exhaust.

If you're trying to run with a stock exhaust, you are wasting your money on 
other modifications (IMHO).  The stock exhaust system doesn't allow the 
engine to breath deep enough to benefit from more carburation.  My stock 
dispacement 1600 runs quite nicely with the 110 cam, smoothed exhaust and 
intake ports, dual Kadrons and extractor exhaust.  And, it gets low twenties 
on the highway cruising 60-65.  It will run faster (I've had it momemtarily 
up to 80 but backed off - too scary for a '69 Kombi!)

&lt;My rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, balanced fully,smoothed intake and exhaust
ports, and extractor exhaust needs a little more OOMPH at highway speeds. I
am thinking about dual Kadrons and 1.25 ratio rocker arms. Anyone have an
opinion (boy, that's a loaded statement)on the effect these mods would have?
Would they affect reliability?Any help or information would be greatly
appreciated. TBear&gt;
