Hi Everybody,

I forgot to tell everyone that the engine and me are in Southern California.
More specifically in Oceanside which is in North San Diego County.  I'm
willing to take up to a four hour trip in my Westy if someone really wanted
the engine.  It'll give me a chance to test my fresh 2 liter...:)
