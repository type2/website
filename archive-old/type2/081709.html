Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal

Jack up the spindle so the upper arm is off the rubber stop.  Remove the
clip holding the rubber stop on.  Lower the spindle.  Beat on the inside of
the arm and it will be off in under 10 blows (using a 4lb hammer!).  Then it
will slide right off.  Putting back on be sure the seal is properly seated.
Don't mangle as all my research shows they are currently NLA.

Good luck,
Bill

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I forgot you didn't already know what is was thinking...  I
would
&gt; &gt; &gt; follow Bentley.  I wouldn't heat the trailing arm.  I would remove the
arm
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
&gt; &gt; &gt; (unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place that
knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; what their doing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bus Boys has rebuilt trailing arms for 175 plus 50 for the cores.
&gt; &gt; Just a thought if you plan to do all 4. I dont know if theyll swap them
&gt; &gt; individually.
&gt;
&gt; I'm in the midst of this same process on my '70 and having recently
replaced ball joints on a Type 3 I thought I would have no problem.  Well,
the first thing I found is that the upper control arm setup is different and
I can't figure out how to get it
&gt; out.  On the Type 3 all I had to do was take out a stop plate and the
whole thing rotated up in the torsion tube and the drop arms slipped right
out.  The Type 2 has tension against the rubber stops and I can't figure how
the drop arms come off.
&gt;
&gt; The second thing I found is that the same shop I took the Type 3 drop arms
to claimed they could only replace the ball joints while the arms were still
on the vehicle (by heating it up).  Having already been told by several
people that is not the case I
&gt; took my business elsewhere.  I turns out my local VW FLAPS has welded up a
little jig specifically for the Type 2 ball joints.  As some of you have
found out, the Type 2 ball joint has a flange that goes all the way to the
edge of the control arm with the
&gt; exception of 2 notched areas so its hard to set it safely in the press.
The VW shop's jig lets the control arm sit in those 2 notches while the
press exerts pressure on the ball joint.  So today I will pick up my 2 lower
control arms with new ball joints
&gt; and only pay $30 labor for the pair instead of the $125 each that the tire
store wanted to charge me for doing it on the vehicle.
