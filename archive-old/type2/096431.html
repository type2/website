Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

Jamie,

I'm not sure that I believe this(no disrespect here).  Powdercoating has 
to get up to 400 degrees before flowing...right?

The story doesn't talk about them going down a long incline at that point 
and I also cannot believe that all 5 lugs would fall off instantly at the 
exact same time.  

I find it difficult to believe that the brake drum to rim area will get 
that hot....anyone ever checked this with one of those infared 
thermometers?

I can believe that front disks might get that hot on the rotor surface 
after going down a mountain for 30 minutes, but rims getting that 
hot?...I'm having a hard time on this one...

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt;From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:
&gt; &gt; &quot;...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left wheel came off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the powdercoating
&gt; &gt;  on the wheels caused the lug bolt to lose torque some 4000 miles after the wheels lug bolts had been properly torqued on.

&gt; Tragic!.... SOmething I was told before I put the wheels on my vehicles,,,
&gt; 
&gt; BEFORE putting freshly painted rims on a vehicle,, REMOVE THE PAINT on the back of the rim where it contacts the brake part,, and from the taper area on the front, where the nut/bolt tightens on,,
&gt; This is just a small circle area 
&gt; 
&gt; The Reason being,....
&gt; The first hard brake application will heat up the drum/rotor enough to make the paint like jelly,, or worse,, and it will squeeze out from between the drum and the rim, and the rim and the nut/bolt
&gt; ,and you rim will be LOOSE!
