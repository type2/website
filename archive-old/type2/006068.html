Heck! Most of the replacement parts I have used over the years have been
rebuilt.  It is a cost issue... bang for the buck.  Is the rebuilt unit that
you are being offered a bosch unit under a rebuilder's label?  I have had
both Beck and Bosch parts from various rebuilders.  The seller can sometimes
tell you which core part brand is available.  So I suppose a rebuilt Bosch
would be as good as a new one for my money.
Respectfully,
Steve


&gt;  My starter is going bad I was wondering if it was worth getting the new
$115
&gt;Bosch starter over a $45 rebuild?  I'll be installing whichever I choose I
&gt;just don't know if a new Bosch is that much better?
