Subject: Re: Fuel Pressure Gauge?

Several people said they just add a second oil pressure sender to the
engine (on the fuel rack, of course) and wire it to the oil pressure
gauge with a switch to go back and forth between oil and fuel pressure.
   Sounds good to me, *and* it solves my wish that I had got the sender
with two terminals when I first bought my VDO oil pressure gauge instead
of being cheap and getting the single version and then having to put in
a T for the idiot light sensor. However -- it also makes me sincerely
wish I had bought the 80lb. version instead of the 150lb. gauge. Can't
imagine what I was thinking -- even back when I had a super heavy-duty
pump in my '68 van the pressure never went over 80. And the 80 gauge
gives finer definition. 
   So will the 150lb gauge read closely enough to be useful for watching
fuel pressure? And is there any real difference in the 150 and 80
senders? I notice some ads offer both gauges but only one sender.
