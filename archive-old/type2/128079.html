Subject: Sun tach. and Mallory CDI  was: coil and tach

On a similar note, I can't get my Sun tach. to work with the Mallory CDI (&amp; Compufire).  Not sure if this diode method would work.  Tried all combos of wires, even + off coil.  Short of getting an adaptor, anyone have a similar issue or know of a solution?

&gt;I just installed a new Pertronix Flame Thrower coil and discovered that 
&gt;it causes my VDO tach to read double the actual RPM.

I wonder if this modification will help?
