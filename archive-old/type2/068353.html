&gt;&gt;So you worldwide net community, here's the question: Does your horn
&gt;&gt;work, and what is it for?

Her Majesty's horn works fine.

I use it when crazy LAShuns:

1)   are clueless
2)   are out of control on ice
3)   think that just because they spent $40K on a Sports Utility 
Vehicle that is will stop on ice


and when I do my monthly vehicle check
