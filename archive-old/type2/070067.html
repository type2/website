&gt;BS, I have a '73 1/2 or a '74 front seat in a '76, the seat is the
&gt;early non headrest type with the big circle handle tilt back adjustment.
&gt;I then used the frame from the origional bolstered '76 in the '78.
&gt;This is fact, the buses are within miles of my residence, could at a
&gt;whim go swap the '74 seat into the '77 or '78 or '81.  Although the
&gt;style of seat varies greatly the runners are compatible.

So why doesn't a '78 drivers seat in my 12/'73? Both are 1/3 + 2/3 seat busses.

The '73 seat has welded on runners while the '78's are bolted on with allen bolts,
the track width is different.

The seats are *not* interchangeable. Maybe you are referring to walk-throughs??
