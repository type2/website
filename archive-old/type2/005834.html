Really do youself a favor, and buy an oil temp gauge........They are cheap
and may save the engine....contrary to popular belief, gauges are accurate..

&gt; One question was not answered: How do you know if your engine ('71 Type 1
&gt; 1600 DP in a 66 bus) in your vintage bus is too hot WITHOUT GAUGES?  Is
&gt; Muir's suggestion of &quot;If you can hold the dipstick in your hand for a
couple
&gt; of seconds without burning your fingers off, then your engine is running
&gt; cool enough&quot; an accurate standard by which to measure?  Anyone have any
&gt; other little tricks for estimating engine temp
&gt;
&gt; One &quot;trick&quot; is to smell the engine.  An engine that is running too hot
will
&gt; definately have a distinctive odor.
&gt; An inexpensive, easy add-on is the Gene Berg oil dipstick sender which
&gt; attaches to the oil pressure switch.  Some people don't like wiring two
&gt; separate items to the same idiot light, but if you have ever used one of
&gt; these senders, you can immediately tell the difference between low oil
&gt; pressure and high oil temp by the distinctive  flicker of the light when
the
&gt; engine is running hot. It is an incredibly easy installation, and I think
it
&gt; is worth the $15. or so.  Gauges are better, IMHO, but I'm not taking mine
&gt; off (which is actually a short version threaded into the Type lll dipstick
&gt; block-off plate), because I like the idiot light function.  I can't stare
at
&gt; gauges all the time!
