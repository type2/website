Hi Tom,

On my 79 the sender wire comes out of the bottom of the tank compartment on
the right hand side of the bus. If you get underneath you'll find a thick
clump of wires, and with patience you'll spot the one leading into the tank.
It should have a push on connector, which is probably pushed through the
rubber grommet in the tank compartment. I was worried I'd pull mine off and
not be able to reconnect it so I scraped some insulation off and tested it
that way, then taped up.

Yup, the sender was faulty, and I had to take the panel off at the back of
the engine to replace it. With the upright engine I'm pretty sure it'll have
to come out to do this, but the type 4 can stay in OK.
