 Hi volks,

&gt; How fast do you drive your bus?

	   In my '71 Westy (sold 1994) I tried to run 55-60mph, the engine had
been rebuilt and was a bit tired (flickering, warning light at idle).
	  In my current '77 Devon camper I usually run at an indicated
70-75mph, slower uphill (duh!) and faster to overtake if necessary. I am
currently working on the theory that anything over 76mph is a pushing it a
bit (My owner's manual suggests  this as top speed) and likely to reduce engine
life significantly.  I think my highest speed was an indicated 85 (might have
been a little over).
 I had a '68 in New Zealand- I drove that at about 60, I think. I blew an
engine and had to have it rebuilt (stupid timing error, don't think the speed
was really an issue).

 I  plan to put a 911 engine into my bus, partly so that I can comfortably
cruise at ~85 and still have some reserve for hills and overtaking.

 I'd be interested to see a summary of the responses, if you wouldn't mind
compiling it.

Cheers,
        W.
