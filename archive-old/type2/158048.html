Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Travel Question

Class 8 trucks are the same way to this day----
And to pass the CDL truck driving test here in IL. you must know how to
double clutch the truck to engauge the next gear, or downshift.

However---all this double clutching humbug isn't necessary---

The engine has a peak RPM.
Lsten for that, get off the throttle, and grab the next gear.
Same with downshifting, blip the throttle pull her outa gear, blip it
again and your into the next lower gear.
If your good you can skip a whole gear range---

A 13 speed has low, direct, and OD--5 gears in each range.

A Quad Box has 4 on the main box, 4 on the auxillary---

Main box 1st run the auxillary 1,2 ,3 ,4
Flip the main into 2nd, run the auxillary 1,2, 3, 4, again.
Continue this all the way up to 4th main &amp; 4th auxillary.

It used to be a pain prior to having an air auxillary selector in the
gear box--and you had to use two sticks to all this selecting ranges
instead of a thumb operated switch on the top of the gear shift lever

B-Model Macks had this set up.  

All this shifting could be done without the clutch--just your ear .

All's you needed the clucth for was to get rolling from a dead stop and
to stop.

Who came up with this double clutching bizarrness??

No VW ever required it---
