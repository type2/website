Subject: Re: valve cover leaks

+AD4APg-Im having trouble sealing my valve cover
+AD4APg-on one side,

I had this problem on my 79 when I renewed the cork gaskets. One side leaked
quite badly. I eventually found out that the original did the job OK, so I
set about trying to find out what the difference was. i concluded that there
were two things. Firstly the gasket shape wasn't quite the same so it wasn't
making as good contact in one corner. I could see this from the impression
on the seal when I took the cover off. Some adjustment here started to get
it right. Secondly the gaskets I was using had been hanging up in my garage
for some time and had got a bit dried out and curly (like a British Railways
sandwich). By soaking them in oil I then got  a perfect seal with no
adhesive.
