Friends, Busfolds,Countrymen- I come before you to ask for funds to keep our
wonderful list on line.  Our magnificent benefactor has turned the financing
function back to the list and rightly so. Many of you may no know that Steve
dolan has been financing the operation of the list himself for some time now
and for this a BIG thank-you is in order.

The first order of business is to raise money to cover our $150.00 per month
internet access fee ( a $50.00 a month increase over our present fee, but
necessary for the  bandwidth we require).  The second order of business is
that we need a new server which will cost approximately $1,400.00. If
everyone contributes, we should have no trouble raising this money among our
800+ members.  Think about how useful and helpful the list has been to you
in the past, and PLEASE give what you can, even if it's only a few dollars.
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS!!!

The server is a one-time expense, but the internet access fees will be
ongoing, and as a results we may be asking for donations again down the road
at some time.

Donations to the list support fund should be sent to:

		Type2 Fundraiser
		C/O Ted Finesman
		8405 Reading Rd.
		Cincinnati, Oh. 45215
		1-877-517-4811 (toll-free for any questions or information)
		tedebare_at_one_dot_net (for pay-pal)

PLEASE dig as deep as you can so that this valuable resource can continue.
