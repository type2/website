Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solex carbs

&gt;It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
&gt;death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't
&gt;be stock, where the highest value to the most is found. Why?? Cause it's
&gt;easy to make stock work right.

Engineering, already done by VW, the 2.0 system will run clean and
fine on any T4 and probably pass emissions easily as is, or with
simple adjustment (1 screw to do idle.)

Fabrication, as I mentioned, yeah a hassle to cut out the AFM support
bracket and to swap the tank, but again for anyone who can read, and
take notes, a weekends effort not more IF you start with a complete
running system.

Easiest to make stock work right, well like I said, a good running L-jet
will bolt right on without any adjustments and be a good running L-jet.
Finding the parts to return to a dual carb setup these days is a hell of
a lot harder than finding a nice junked '76-'79 bus.  Let alone setting them
up which is admittedly again a function of common sense and reading,
no more but most people on this list would be as able to get a FI up
and running as a set of '72-'74 carbs.

As to value, I give you that, in a &quot;collector&quot; sense, but I'm no collector
and don't believe bay buses should ever be considered collectible.  Value
to drive on an everyday basis, that goes to the injection to anyone
inclined to reality.

I'm not saying this is for everyone, but with common sense, simple tools,
and starting with a good running system, chances are it will run much
better than carbs for another 50k or more.  Carb guys are carb guys, they
understand carbs and were never happy being dragged into the 70's and
the world of the transistor, VW went to FI for mileage, emissions,
driveability, etc, etc, etc.  It is ludicrous to pass up progress when it is
available, else we'd all be rebuilding are 25hp uprights every 25,000 miles.

Now I will say I live in happy WV where emissions laws don't limit my
doing anything I care to do, but Steve gets his '73 smogged in VA
and I believe even CA lets you update to anything newer that came on
the same basic engine.
