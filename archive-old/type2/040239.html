&gt;     I have a un-usual problem The egr system was removed from my bus and the
&gt;bolt hole in the exhaust chamber of the heads plugged with standard bolts.
&gt;One of then blew out yesterday at freeway speeds. Now I sound like a
&gt;motorcycle and the screw does not screw in. It seems the threads are gone.
&gt;Because the bolt head also covers tinwork (don't think it is necessary to
&gt;hold the tin on) I am concerned about using - say JB weld and not being able
&gt;to get the bolt out if the tin work needs removal in the future. Also, I sure
&gt;would like to avoid engine removal to fix the problem if at all possible.

Get thee to the hardware store and buy a bolt that is 1cm longer.  You can 
also use a longer bolt and stack washers under the head so that the bolt 
goes in 1cm farther than before.  Put a lock washer on the bolt and put 
blue loctite on the threads.  Don't over-tighten the bolt - just tighten it 
enough that the lock washer compresses and no more.  It will last a while - 
how long depends on the condition of the remaining threads in that hole.

You have to be careful about the length of the bolt.  Put one in that is 
too long and it will protrude into the exhaust port and block the flow of 
the exhaust out of the cylinder, which is a UC (undesireable 
condition).  If in doubt, remove the heat exchanger and look up into the port.

The &quot;rebuilt&quot; heads that I got from GEX had varying amounts of good threads 
in those holes.  One was so bad that there were not enough good threads to 
hold even the longest bolt in.  On this port I used the DM (David's 
Methode).  I found a coarse-thread SAE bolt that was ever-so-slightly 
larger in diameter than the stock metric one and simply threaded it in.  It 
was a perfect fit - tight enough that it would stay in but loose enough 
that I could run it in with a 3/8&quot; wratchet without too much effort.  Of 
course, this destroyed what was left of the original threads for all time, 
but I didn't care.  It lasted till I removed the heads over a year 
later.  Those heads are sitting on a shelf in my garage now, and if I ever 
decide to use them again, I will have the ports welded shut.

My permanent solution to the problem was to get another set of heads 
without the ports.  If you want to rid yourself of this problem forever, 
you might want to start thinking about doing the same.  You will need 
&quot;1700&quot; (1972) or fuel-injection (1975-78) heads.  They will have smaller 
valves, but it won't make any significant difference in the power output of 
your engine - in fact it will likely increase power output slightly (the 
dyno does not lie).  If you have an 1800 or 2000 engine the 1700 heads will 
have to be &quot;opened up&quot; to accept the larger barrels - a cheap and easy mod.

Or, you could take it to a trained professional, who will likely tell you 
to find the last existing set of NOS 73/74 heads and all the stock EGR 
equipment in Germany and fly it over here, but that would likely cost as 
much as a a good used 1995 BMW 325i convertible with automatic, air, ash 
tray and four cupholders.
