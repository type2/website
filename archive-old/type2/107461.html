Subject: Movie

Don't know if anyone has posted this yet.  I think most bus pilots will
find it amusing.  Search around for the movie on the site.

Required bus content:  Just got my Megasquirt kit installed in the
westy.  Runs good so far.  Still a lot of tweaking to do though.  I'll
post some pictures and maybe even a dyno test (if my connection comes
through) in a while.
