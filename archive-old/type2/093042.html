Subject: Re: [T2] Why VW buses die

And every time you fix a failure you are that closer to a &quot;new&quot; vehicle. 
Done right repairs ought to stay repaired for a long time if you do it 
right and use quality parts.

Staying fixed for a long time is the reason I don't use duct tape, fix 
broken wires with tape, etc. etc.

&gt;3. see #1 above :) A type 2 in good shape should not leave you
&gt;stranded, but it's nice to know that many of the repairs that would
&gt;leave you on the shoulder of a road are usually easily fixed on
&gt;location w/ minimal tools. Plus if you bought a bus in good mechanical
&gt;shape this should rarely happen w/ a good maintenance habit. Plus how
&gt;many other types of vehicles do you know that have a list of people
&gt;around the US (&amp; world) who can help if broken down (airs).
