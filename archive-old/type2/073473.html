&gt;So, to reiterate (because I want to make sure I'm very, very clear on this):

&gt;If I get a 78 2.0L with hydraulic lifters and a 210mm flywheel from AVP,
&gt;I can drop it into my old engine compartment on my 73, without having to
&gt;upgrade either a) my starter, b) my engine tin, or c) my heat
&gt;exchangers. I *will* have to rejet my carbs to compensate for the
&gt;increased displacement.

Why do you need to get the 210mm flywheel from AVP?  You already have one
in your bus.  Yes you can use your existing starter, engine tin, and heat
exchangers (as long as you specify 76-79 oval port heads).  If you want to
upgrade your clutch, get the 215mm flywheel, clutch disc, and pressure
plate - they are a straight bolt-in replacement in a '73 bus.  In either
case, don't forget to check/reset end play when you install your flywheel.

You will not necessarily have to rejet your carbs - I didn't have to when I
went from 1.8 to 2.0l.  Depends on what you have.  For SoCal I'd recommend
132.5 mains, 55 idles and 155 air correction.  You should still have your
A/F checked under load with a wideband O2 after your engine is installed.
Idle readings, and even fast idle readings do not indicate whether your
main fuel circuit is rich or lean.
