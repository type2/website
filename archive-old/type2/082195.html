Subject: Re: [T2] More Corvair Bus Troubles W.V. (Transmission)

Sorry Glen,

I really need to give the Type2 folks more credit. I just came from the
Porsche world and there are some real nin-com-poops over there (one guy who
was afraid to check his oil with the engine running - in the 911 you can
check it buy turning off the engine and running back real quick - but come
on - the dipstick and oil fill nozzle are over the oil reservior and away
from the engine a bit - just tuck that yuppie noose into your shirt and
reach in there!).

I just saw a combination of things: corvair engine and indecision between a
dead battery and a seized engine as a warning sign. Oh yeah, alot of the 911
clueless folks buy exotic variations too.

My fault, I guess, was thinking the fan belt and alternator were separate on
the corvair engine. Now I see that it is one - just the the VW upright and
the 911!

My hat is off to you for driving a corvair powered bus of unknown quality at
3am!

-Eric

P.S. I posted this to the list becuase I posted my 'roast' to the list
originally.
&gt; The belt broke and the battery went dead at the same time it overheated
&gt; since the alternator wasn't running, get it?  It was 3am and I had to
&gt; leave it there and was not able to fully ascertain what was going on.

&gt;&gt; &gt; the engine going again.  I had thought it siezed but it did not -
&gt;&gt; &gt; the battery just went dead.  Good thing it was night and I had the
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ummm... Glen, if you mistook a dead battery for a seized engine, maybe
&gt;&gt; you aren't the guy to deal with a Corvair conversion. I know I
&gt;&gt; wouldn't
&gt; attempt
&gt;&gt; such a task. Even thouhg my father's first new car was a Corvair and
&gt;&gt; I'd have more help than I wanted, there's a reason you don't see many
&gt;&gt; of these on the road.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; headlights on or it would have toasted it before the battery died.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hmmmm... If the battery is dead and the engine is running - except for
&gt;&gt; smelling weird stuff from the battery, there is no way to tell. If
&gt;&gt; your headlights were dimming as you drove then your battery is fine.
&gt;&gt; You need
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; check your generator/alternator/whatever GM put on the Nadermobile...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; has acted up.  It is stuck in 1st and the shifter moves into 1, 3,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and neutral but it stays in first no matter what, unless I push the
&gt;&gt; &gt; clutch
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Linkage! Linkage! Linkage! you've got at least four feet more linkage
&gt;&gt; in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; bus than the Corvair originally had - and even then any linkage can
&gt;&gt; suffer bigtime from minor problems. New bushings, adjusting the
&gt;&gt; linkage, etc,
&gt; will
&gt;&gt; probably fix all your problems.
