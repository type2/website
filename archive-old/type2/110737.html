Subject: LPG regulator

Hello all
Working on a 79 Westy

My propane tank pressure regulator seems to be
malfunctioning. When I open the valve, the pressure
regulator hisses from a small hole (which looks like
it belongs)...
Anybody have any experience with this situation???

Does anyone have a good used one they could part with?
We leave for about five or six weeks of traveling in
the June, so I need to get this done soon!

Thanks in advance
