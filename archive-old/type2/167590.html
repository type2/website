&gt; hey Guys  You would be surprized how far you can drive on three  clylinders,
&gt; Take the push rod out for the valve that has problems,  disconnect the
&gt; injector for that clylinder and drive it home.  I drove my  59 panel 250 miles like
&gt; that once.

I also loosened the plug and remmoved the plug wire, but drove my 78 bus
home from upstate Maine to Baltimore on 3 cyl, and apparently without
knowing it I drove on three cyl to everybus and almost all the way back
