Subject: Is it feasible with my bus! (Big winter trip)

Good day gentlemen's,
My Bus: 1973 westy with dual (Rebuilt) Solex 1700cc.

I would gladly appreciate your comments, advices and suggestions on a
journey from Montreal Canada crossing all eastern states to Louisiana,
Texas, Mexico, Arizona (on my way back) and California next February.(I
have to say that I am a bit scared!!!)
If you have any advice on which route to take (less possible snow for
the north parts of my trip = Eastern coast), which spare parts to bring
or other stuff to &quot;Not forget&quot;. Would you do a 10k+ miles trip with a 30
years old van especially in wintertime, mostly by myself also!!!

Here is the condition of my Bus:

-Body and chassis: Strong and rust free. Most windows and door seals
change. Windshield washer pump added and wiper motor is new. 5 new
winter tires. New brake, rotor, calliper, brake cylinder. New
Steering-box and damper. New shifting stick bushing. I have original
heat + portable propane heater. New shocks on all 4 wheels. New seats.
Emergency brake cable are new. New gas and clutch cable. Wheel bearing
where change by PO.

-Engine: It's a reman from VW Canada put in the bus in 1990, before that
the van was not running!!! in the PO Company factory (heated) on block
for 11 years (wife had cancer) under a tarp. The engine actual condition
is as follow: Compression is 95(#3)-105-100-110, oil consumption is
minimum, I recently rebuilt Carbs (no more fuel leak), Alternator (3
spare regulator) and starter were recently rebuilt, all normal tune-up
parts have been change of course, pushrod tubes are new with new seal,
distributor (J) was rebuilt + I have 2 spare one. Oil filter neck
gasket, oil cooler seal, rear engine crankcase shaft seal and basically
all leaking possibility/place have bean repair or have new seal or
gasket including the dip stick flexible rubber boot and oil sump plate
seal (with oil temp sender). Also, a few engine bore plug have been seal
(the rear one). All valves top end were buffed flat, all adjusting
screws and nuts where replace with new one or good one(I have some spare
one also). I have spare rocker assembly also. (new section coming soon
on my site)

-Cooling system: Fan housing and fan were remove, cleaned and polish.
All engine cooling thin / plate were remove, sanded, painted and sealed.
Main engine seal is new. Cylinder sleeve fin and head fin where clean.
Thermostat and cable were replace also with new one. (new section coming
soon on my site)

-Exhaust system: Heater box are in fair condition, new muffler with 4 in
1 header.

-Transmission (slightly leaking): Drive axle where just rebuilt. Tranny
condition/history is unknown but works great. No gear popping out, no
noise, no problem getting the gear in. Oil will be change before I go.
Clutch and front crankshaft seal were replace by PO.

-Spare parts: Too many!! Including 2 heads. (Any suggestion here!) I
will order a spare electric fuel pump (mechanical on the bus right now).

Tools: Enough to rebuilt the engine!
No need to tell you that I am mechanically oriented! I am mentally
prepare and equiped to change a head along the way!

Thanks to all from this great site for all the good advice I had in the
pass so I could partially give a fresh look/rebuilt to this Bus. (A
special thanks to Jim)
Your advice will influence my decision!

Best regards, Ben
Ps.: I do know that I will have a hard time finding parts in Mexico!
Well, we have only one life to live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
