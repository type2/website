Subject: need FI manual

does anyone know where i can get a copy of the
EFI book?

i used to have one, but traded it away to someone who
needed it.

now i have a bus with FI &amp; i would like one of these
books.  IIRC the cover was orange &amp; it was approx. the
same dimensions as the Bentley.

yes, i've checked the un-nameable auction site already.

TIA,

Joel Wilson
