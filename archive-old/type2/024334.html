&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew of a good way to clean out and seal a gas
&gt; tank that
&gt; has been sitting around with gas in it?

Everything can be done in a good way. In this case it does not mean cheap
or easy. Remove the tank. Seal all openings.
Fill with a dilution of muratic acid. Slosh around to all positions and
let sit for a time in each. Empty and give it a triple rinse. Run a hose
&gt;from the exhaust pipe of another car into the tank. Start it up and let
it run for 20 minutes or so and the tank will be bone dry. Then add a
proprietory tank sealant and turn the tank over and over to spread it 
around. Use the exhaust hose again to speed drying. Have another 20 plus
years of rust free carburation.

Alturnative. Leave the tank in place. Unhook the rear shocks. Disconnect
the fuel line. Fill the tank with the garden hose. Rock the whole chassis
serverly while draining. Repeat many times until drain water is relatively
clear of rust. Dry with the exhaust hose trick. Put a new screen in the 
fuel outlet fitting. Change fuel filters often. This can get you a couple
of years more use before problems redevelop.

&gt; 
&gt; Also I need to find an air flow meter for a '78.  Does anyone know if
&gt; you can
&gt; get the circuit board that is in the meter, directly from Bosch?
&gt; 

Not available from Bosch or anywhere else I am aware of. Boy, that Bosch
stuff sure is garbage. Only lasts 20 years before needing replacement.
Why does it have to cost $500 to make a precision part last 20 years??
Reality.
