Subject: RE: [T2] Engine won't start - ideas?


	There should be a timing mark on the top ridge of the dizzy once the cap is 
removed.  With #1 cyl at TDC, the crank-pulley timing notch should be 
lined-up with the split in the center of the case, and the rotor in the 
distributor should be pointing at the mark on the perimeter of the 
distributor's lip.  This should be where the #1 cylinder's ignition wire 
should be.
