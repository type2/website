Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

What have we heard about Chinese Piersburg carbs etc etc.?  A few bugs to be 
worked out yet, not going to be up to German quality standards for a while I 
fear.
BTW, all this talk about Meximotors not being available soon, is making me 
want to buy one while I still can.
