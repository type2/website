&gt; Anybody out there done their bumpers in powder coat?

Have those bumpers powdercoated zinc rich primer
then topcoated your favorite color. The primer will
ensure less rust travel from minor scratches. Primer
is not normally applied or necessary for powder.

I powdercoat a lot of parts. engine case, heads, cylinders, carbs,
starter, alternator, muffler, heater boxes, engine tin, fan shroud,
distributors,door handles,brake drums,hub caps, the list is endless.
