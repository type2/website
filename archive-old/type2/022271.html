I got this from Doktor Tim, it definitely seems worth reposting to the list:

&gt; &gt;Volks,
&gt; &gt;    I've been cleaning up my tinware in preparation for the installation of
&gt; &gt;my new AVP engine ('78 Westy). Has anyone tried using POR-15, or should I
&gt; &gt;just use regular engine paint? Can POR-15 handle the heat around the
&gt; &gt;exhaust parts?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks!

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Rob:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think you need any sort of &quot;high heat&quot; type product for the
&gt; &gt;tinware since it never should really get that hot.  The big issue for the
&gt; &gt;tin is rust, which you address by a good cleaning and a good painting
&gt; &gt;(with ordinary paint.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;I agree. Use a small hammer to tap out the kinks and bumps. Hit the rust
&gt;with abrasives. Use about a 220 then a 400 dry then 400 wet to smooth the
&gt;whole surface and taper the original paint edges. Treat the bare metal with
&gt;Ospho (chandelry) or other rust conversion chemical. Get Rustoleum or
&gt;Krylon or other quality brand paint. Two cans oughta be plenty for the all
&gt;the tin. One is probably enough. Give it three or five or, if your havin'
&gt;fun, seven medium-light coats. Do one side, flip them then do the other,
&gt;five to ten minutes between coats. If you get
&gt;distracted and wait more than 20 minutes from the last coat, stop. If you
&gt;go any longer than that it will turn into a wrinkle finish. (Ask me how I
&gt;know.) Let it dry completely at that stage before continuing with the
&gt;following coats.
&gt;
&gt;If you want the concourse look. Strip completely to bare metal to start.
&gt;Use two or three medium-light coats. Let it dry completely. 400 dry, two or
&gt;three coats. Dry competely, 400 wet, then a medium coat for the last. The
&gt;concourse tech can take several days for drying between coats in cold and
&gt;humid conditions. Itermediate coats should be hard dry before sanding. In
&gt;hot dry conditions you might be able to get that down to a day in the sun.
&gt;
&gt;The only thing better is powdercoat.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't like the newspapers &amp; tiptoeing through the tripfalls on the
&gt;floor
&gt;technique, hang a line across the garage and hang the tin from wires, very
&gt;efficient.
&gt;
&gt;Ban the kids from the garage with either tech. The floor method for obvious
&gt;reasons and the line method acuze they will slice their head open runnin'
&gt;through.
&gt;
&gt;It's about a two beer job for the standard tech. Save the pipe till after
&gt;your done.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Rob, read my post of this afternoon called List Procedure Enhancement.
&gt;
&gt;Post this to the list for me if you have the time and inclination.
&gt;
