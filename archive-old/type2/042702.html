Subject: buying a replacement jack....

Ok,

so the general feeling im getting from everyone is to just buy a different 
one anyway, although ill hang on the old the old one for leveling (great 
suggestion).

So ive heard everything from needing a 20inch one to a 24 inch one. I havent 
seen even one over 21&quot; so far so IM guessing 19-20 should be fine?

Is 19 inches the majic number I should be watching out for? or do I need 
higher?

ive been doing some shopping around and ive heard of people carrying this 
SUV specific set that includes the jackstands as well, but havent been able 
to find one yet.

thanks!
