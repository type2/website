For those of you who have been following my exploits in getting my newly
painted bus back together in 5 days, Day 3 has been filled with exorcising
the electrical gremlins let by the DPO. When I left the shop last night, all
the electrics seemed to be working fine. This morning when I went to batten
down everything, NOTHING WORKED. Nada, zip, no red lights, no headlights, no
nothing. After 4 1/2 hours of prodding, removing the fuse box, checking a
wiring diagram, removing and replacing wires, everything mostly works.

The main problem was the main power lead had come loose. Hooked it up and
then the headlights didn't work. Looked at the wiring diagram- OH that wire
shouldn't be there, it should be here, and so forth.

The end result is the turn signals now burn as bright as they should and
everything seems fine. Will let you all know after the road test on
Wednesday.

Anyway, the electrics are fine, the sound proofing is mostly installed on
the wall, sliding door, and wheel arches, the sliding door seal is installed
and mechanisms greased, and a couple of other things that came up as the day
went on are all done.

Tomorrow is pop-top seal day. Am going to say my prayers and go to bed. I'll
need all the help I can get.  Let you all know how it turns out tomorrow.  I
hope my karma is in good shape. Later, TBear

PS As stolen from Charlie Ford--Thank you for tolerating my ramblings.

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
