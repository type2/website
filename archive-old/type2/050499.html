Subject: [T2] hoax

Gentlepersons-
                      First off, the NCID (Nat'l Center for Infectious 
Diseases), has stated that
this is a hoax traveling the net: Just got three separate emailings about the 
&quot;Klingerman
Foundation Virus&quot; arriving in ordinary mail boxes...Don't know how or why I 
got it but if
others get it, don't pass it on...I repeat, it's a hoax.
