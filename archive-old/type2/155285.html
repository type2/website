Subject: Re: [T2] Scratching sound on acceleration

Hi John,

Does it make this sound when in neutral when the clutch is in, or  
out?  If it is only making the sound with the clutch IN, it's the  
throw-out bearing.

Happy Trails,

&gt; Weird.  Only hear at night when everything is louder, or in light  
&gt; traffic. When I just barely touch the accelerator, this constant  
&gt; sound like  sandpaper scratching (gets louder the more you  
&gt; listen!). I thought it must be the cable, but I tried pressing the  
&gt; accelerator while in neutral, and no sound.  Could it be the clutch?
