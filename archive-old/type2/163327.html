Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA distributor timing

Jay -

The best rule of thumb is to always time your engine according the the
DISTRIBUTOR, not the engine it's installed on.

In this case, set the timing at 5 degrees AFTER TDC at 850-950rpm (+or-
100rpm) with BOTH vacuum hoses connected.  And as Richard advises, check to
make sure the vacuum can, both retard and advance are working properly and
that the points plate it attaches to moves freely without binding.

For over 35 years, I've personally learned the hard way that while there are
at least several dozen different opinions on how to time a Volkswagen, most
of them are WRONG.  This is why I wrote the webpage on the Distributor
Specifications.  Both Bentley and Muir have several mistakes and incomplete
information/data and my research displayed on that page is to &quot;set the
record&quot; straight.  I get daily posts from VW mechanics who have worked on
the beasts for over 30 years and 99 perecent thank me for providing the
correct information that most workshop manuals and books either have
incorrect or omit altogether.

On the other side of the coin, I'm not the be-all or end-all.  Mistakes can
be (and have been) made.  Diligence to the facts is of the most paramount
nature in my webpage.

Since this appears to be a California 79 model, why have you done away with
the Hall/Electronic Distributor in favor of the ancient poinys/condensor
system?  Just curious.

&gt; Greetings VW's
&gt; Questions about a DVDA distributor (0231 181 012) on a 1979 CA engine:
&gt; What is
&gt; the best timing to set this thing for a smooth idle and cool engine?
&gt; In the archive there is a recommendation to remove or plug the retard
&gt; vacuum
&gt; from the DVDA distributor  and time the engine to 7.5 BTDC.
&gt; Old Volks Home distributor info says to set the timing to 5 ATDC for this
&gt; DVDA
&gt; distributor (it's from a 1976) and keep the retard vacuum on.
&gt; My VWFLAPS has a Bentley (I don't - yet!). They said the spec is for 7.5BTDC
&gt; with retard vacuum hoses on.
&gt; Local VW mechanic says to set the DVDA to 0 TDC with retard on, and adjust
&gt; to
&gt; 5 ATDC for smog test later.
&gt; Anyone know what to do?
&gt; Thank U!
