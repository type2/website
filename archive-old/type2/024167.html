Hi folks
     I had sent a post inquiring about whether a 79 Westy with an automatic 
would be a good thing. I learned a lot:  First) that there are alot more 
automatics out there than I knew existed, and, second) that save for one 
respondent, everyone loves their automatic for a variety of reasons. Thanks 
for all who replied- I'm gonna road trip to see the bus in question and drive 
it- hopefully I'll own it soon thereafter.
