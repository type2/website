Subject: Re: [T2] Electric heaters (was Driving in Snow....)

Before leaving for work in the morning I would always turn on the camping
heater in my bus, let it run for 15 minutes and drive on down the road.  The
heat coming out of my dash was 180 degrees F.  As long as everything is hooked
up properly and there are no air leaks, you should get tons of heat in your
bus...
