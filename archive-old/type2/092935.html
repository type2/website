I don't know, but I don't think it's something you have to worry=20
about.  The pushrod is constrained by the master cylinder.

&gt;My pushrod sinks in so that it comes parallel to  the bolts that hold the=

&gt;servo. Is that enough? When I reinstalled the master cylinder I found out=
=20
&gt;that the pushrod pushes the front cylinder a little bit even when no=20
&gt;brakes are applied.

Hmmm... I don't think mine was that way, but it has been several years=20
since I removed the master cylinder.

&gt;I think that there still is fluid in my servo becose I can hear it but I=20
&gt;can=B4t get it out.

Unfortunately, brake fluid is corrosive and it is very likely that the=20
inside of your booster is now rusted.  If it works at all now, it likely=20
won't continue working for long.  I think your best course of action is to=
=20
replace both the master cylinder (to be sure it won't continue to leak into=
=20
the booster) and the booster.

&gt;Have anyone had the same problem and could this be the reason why my front=
=20
&gt;brakes doesn=B4t work? How can I remove all the fluid?

Without removing the booster, the only way I can think of would be with a=20
siphon.

&gt;Hope you understood my english (it is not easy to explain this in a other=
=20
&gt;languge)

I had no problems understanding you - your English is very good.
