Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

In a message dated 11/21/05 5:32:38 PM, sydclarke_at_shaw_dot_ca writes:


&gt; After removing my clutch cable to inspect it, I noticed a &quot;plastic&quot; sheath
&gt; on it about a foot from the front pedal hookup point.  The sheath does not
&gt; slide on the cable in either direction, is it supposed to slide freely on
&gt; the cable?  What purpose does it have?  TIA

&gt;

   It's for to protect the clutch cable when it passes thru' the box
section of the frame to reach the pedal hookup...FWIW, I once
replaced a cable and when I went to attach the adjustment nut,
the cable was an inch or two shy of the lever...After I cursed
the FLAPS counterman for givin' me the wrong cable, I came
to my senses and checked the front connection...D'oh, missed
the tube and had the cable running outside the frame... :-(
