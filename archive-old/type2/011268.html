Subject: Pushrod tube seals on 79 1600
Date: Tue, 25 Jul 2000 17:52:44 BST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I acquired my 1979 1600dp just over a year ago here in the UK. Not knowing 
anything about aircooled engines or busses the archives have provided me 
with a great deal of information to help ease up the learning curve. However 
I'd now like to ask the list for some basic help with pushrod tubes. There 
is a small oil leak from a couple of the pushrod tubes on one side of the 
engine. On checking my manuals and the archives I see I need to remove the 
valve gear and a spring retainer to be able to pull out the tubes. strangely 
there doesn't appear to be a retainer on either cylinder head. Is there 
something different about a 79 engine or are they missing? If this is normal 
how are they kept in place and will they just pull out?
Thanks for any help.
