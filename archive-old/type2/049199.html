Subject: [T2] Listmember Xmas Party

Folks,

In years past, Tom Forhan has graciously had a Listmember Christmas party
every December in the Washington DC area.  This has been a great opportunity
for us to get together and attach faces to the email addresses that we see
every day, and is an event that I have always looked forward to. I want to
extend my appreciation to Tom for being nice enough to put up with a bunch
of us overrunning his house and driveway year after year. :-)

Unfortunately, due to other obligations Tom will be unable to host a party
this year.  So at the suggestion of another listmember, Evon and I thought
that we would offer to do the honors this year. (Only, being Jewish, I'm
afraid we'll have to redesignate it as a Holiday Party. :-)

The date would be Saturday, December 16, say around 2-3 pm (which should
allow enough time on each side for people traveling a few hours to make it a
day-trip).  We live in Perkiomenville, PA, which is about 1 hour from
Philadelphia or 40 minutes from Allentown or Reading Pa. - or about 2-1/2
hours from Tom's house, for those of you who have attended his parties. For
anyone thinking of braving the cold to camp, there are two campgrounds right
down the road.  Of course, significant others are invited, as it will give
the non-VW-interested contingent (such as my wife) something to do.
Children are also welcome, as it will give the non-adult contingent (such as
our two-year-old) something to do.

I'd like a quick hand-count of people who are reasonably certain that they
could make it. (Since I am announcing this at a somewhat late date, I fear
that some people may already have other plans).  If I get more than two or
three positive responses, we'll make it a firm plan and I'll post
directions, etc.  Please reply via p-mail, and I'll post a follow up in the
next day or two to confirm.
