&gt; What possessed you to that? 

when I got the bus the heating system from exchangers to front ducts were
rust dust...touch em and they vanished.  sooooo I totally removed the
entire system and put in a Eberspracher near the front and built a new
heating system around it.

I have since changed the 78 exhaust system to a 75 so that I could use the
better headers and the SS muffler

it also made the engine lighter and easier to work on...

&gt; HOWEVER I have my t-stat and the flaps are set up correctly but they are
&gt; disconected with the cable off because I do not have the stock heat system
&gt; so there are no exchangers and tin under the cyl.  the lowest piece of tin
&gt; on the engine is the &quot;forgotten&quot; piece above the push rod tubes.
&gt; 
&gt; without all the containment I am concerned that it won't get hot enough in
&gt; that area, moving air flow and all.  I don't have any way to effectively
&gt; test it, so I have erred on the side of caution leaving the air flow at
&gt; max.
&gt; 
&gt;  the heating ducts and tin were removed over 5 years ago so it hasn't been
&gt; very high on my priority but if anyone has actually performed accurate
&gt; tests without the heating system installed I would love to know how it
&gt; worked
