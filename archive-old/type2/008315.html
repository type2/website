Ok, this may have long since been discussed but I am adding my point of 
view.
If you go for structural integrity its ok. Look at how many times the VW 
aftermarket, read dealers, sundial etc. did it. Its ok. Follow the same 
path of integrating the top in that others did.
Look, it is a 73, not a early bus that should be cared for. By this time 
(73) so many aftermarket people were on the bandwagen it doesnt make any 
difference. Ok, you might flame me, but think about all the bugs made in 
the fifties that got aftermarket items. These are now considered hot 
items. They are not pure VW, they were EMPI et all, Judson 
Superchargers, etc. Now is the time to change a few (not all) late model 
busses with the latest and the best you can afford. 
What I am saying is, do not use cheap parts, go for something that 
belongs on the bus, use care and do it right. Some years from now when 
the 73 is like the 63 of our era it will stand out and make sense. Try 
and find the correct pieces, like a 73 should have, and I think that 
will be OK.
Jason S.
