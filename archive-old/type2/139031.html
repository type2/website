&gt; This one uses regular bolts to hold the fan on the hub. I know the earlier

Every fan I've pulled from the junkyard used triple square heads.

&gt;&gt; There is also no torque listed for those bolts so you can strip the
&gt;&gt; threads
&gt;&gt; as well. I would go no higher than 11 ft. lbs. Then recheck it after a few
&gt;&gt; hundred miles.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; The Bentley for the 80 Vanagon says to torque them to 14 ft. lbs.

I was going to say 11-14 ft. lbs. but thought it prudent to stay on the low
side. I've always wanted to know that number because I was once quoted it
much too high and guess what happened?

I'm starting to wish I had a copy of it. At least the local library had a
hard bound Vanagon workshop manual. I bet they're were expensive.
