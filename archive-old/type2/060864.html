&gt; Hello Fellow Listees,
&gt; OK, I know this is a Vanogon question, but I don't belong to the Vanogon
&gt; list, because I don't have a vanogon, I own a 73 Westy. However my
&gt; father has borrowed by brother-in-laws 85 vanogon, and the
&gt; battery/altenator light has come on. It goes off temporarily while
&gt; driving/idleing up, but comes back on when stopped. Any suggestions on
&gt; what to check or do would be great. Thanks for being wherever you are.

Mike:
You've about a 75% chance of fixing it with a regulator(&amp; brush)
assembly. Take the battery cable off, take off 2 wires, the screws
attaching the regulator, put on the new regulator, put it back together.
Darn near the easiest repair on a Vanagon! I'm guessing around $20-$28
at list mentioned parts places.
