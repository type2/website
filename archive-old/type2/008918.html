Dear List-
	Does anybody know if a 1700 CC engine came with hydrolic lifters?  Also
Is $400 a good deal for a complete turn key engine with 34,000 miles on
it?  A buddy of mine here in Albuquerque has one for that price and it
sounds really good since my 73 Westy cought fire.  

thanks in advance

Chuck
