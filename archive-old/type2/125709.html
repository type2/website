Subject: fridge

I have a fridge from a 80s westy. I am having trouble lighting it on propane. 
I have got it to stay on a couple times, but sometimes after clicking the 
airpump and holding the yellow button I can watch the flame light then it goes 
out, even while holding the button. Please help, would like to go camping soon. 
Dylan
