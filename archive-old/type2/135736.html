Subject: Road trip confirmed: Leaving Anaheim, CA for Denver, CO

Oh, man... I'm so nervous. I haven't done ANY cross country driving
since I was 20! (Cali to North Carolina in my 76 280z... heh)

On 2/12 or 2/13 I'll be leaving Cali for Denver, CO. Well, Englewood,
CO, anyway.

Driving my bus. 

If I was driving the 84 Volvo or the 86 Acura I wouldn't be so
nervous. Why I'm more nervous with the bus I have no idea. I have AAA.
I have the tools and skills to repair most anything that is likely to
fail (knocks on wood). In fact, I'm more able to repair the bus than I
am any other car I've owned. Probably just because the ACVW engines
lend themselves so nicely to roadside repairs.

Once I'm on the road I'll probably be fine. But until then....

At least my mileage driving as hard as I do and with doing 75 on the
freeway is up to 16mpg. So I'm happy there, though I don't plan on
doing that speed on this trip. 55-60 all the way for me (when I can,
of course...heh).

This weekend I'll do another oil change (just did one 1,000 miles
ago), valves, points, plugs, etc. Full tune up. I'm also hoping to get
the exhaust studs replaced and inserts or even heli-coil installed in
the stud bosses that are stripped out. I'll do that myself if I must,
but I'd rather have a shop do it. The idea of drilling into my
precious heads makes me nervous. Also putting the correct HEs in,
which means I get to put the bottom tin back on (old HEs didn't allow
for the bottom tin to be installed.)

I'm going to start looking for a used (but good) steering box. Mine
has the adjustment maxed out yet there is no binding and still slop in
the steering at the box. While doing that I'll replace the swing lever
pin thingie. I already have that part, so since I'm in there I'll
gidderdone. The one in there is original I think and the rubber
bushings have long rotted away. Funny thing is it doesn't move up and
down as the books say it will when worn.

This weekend will also see new front tires. The ones on there are not
only bald, but they're passenger tires. The rears are load rated 98s
and while they're passenger tires, they are way stiffer than even the
102's on my Volvo of the same size (205 70 14). So they'll hold for
this trip. I do have an awesome spare ready to go. So I will probably
do something similar.

Also, I'm finally gonna do what I said a long time ago I would do but
I keep putting off... BRAKES. New rear cylinders, new shoes, new lines
all around, new front pads. I really hope the drums and rotors will
turn within spec. I don't want to buy new ones...

First (or last, depends) will be my oil switch. It's not connected to
anything, so I need to figure that out. I don't want to drive without
an oil light...

I think that's it. I won't have time for rust repair before I leave,
as much as I hate to push that off... I did finish up my lights all
around except for the reverse lights. They're fine at the housing so
there's either a bad reverse switch or the wiring forward of the
engine compartment somewhere is hosed. It'll have to wait as well.

Pics with the lights all on and pretty taken this morning:

I was expecting to be able to spread this over the next 4 weekends,
but now it's been cut to two. But at least the company is footing the
bill for 3 weeks of hotel stay plus a $50 per diem. =D
