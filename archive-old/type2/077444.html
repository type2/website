Subject: replacing heating tubes

Hello,

Well, its starting to get colder at night around the bay area, and a trip to
oregon is coming up so I would like to start working on the heat in the bus,
which as of right now does not exist.

From the heater boxes is the long pipe that runs the length under the bus,
and there is a little vent under the back bench seat that it connects to to
heat the rear.... Basically, I have that long one still in place, but the
ones that come off of that to heat the actual bus are long gone. What is a
good replacement option for this tubing, that may actually give me a little
heat this winter?

Im guessing just some standard hardware store stuff will work, but if anyone
has any specific suggestions, let me know.

Thank You!

Christopher
