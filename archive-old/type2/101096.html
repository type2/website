Subject: Re: [T2] generator problem

Steve,

Might be lots of things....check wiring and voltage regulator first....

but!  just unhook the generator electrically(cover hot wires with tape for 
sure) and then pop the belt off of it.

Start the engine and run on just the battery for less than 2 
minutes..._dot_cause no cooling fan.

Then you know if it is engine or generator.

I have had a generator lock up in the middle of a parade and made
the engine seem like it was locked up....wouldn't turn over or anything!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am a bit stale on type1 engines, as it has been a number of years since
&gt; I worked on one regularly and I have runb into a bit of a problem... When
&gt; I was over at Pat Flynn's place working on his over the weekend we had
&gt; some wierd symptoms. I cranked the engine and we got a regular click, as
&gt; if of an electrical arc, coming from the generator.  The bus did start
&gt; eventually but ran badly for 2-3 seconds then backfired and died.  His
&gt; (new)  battery also keeps going flat on him.  I am quite mystified at all
&gt; this, frankly and all I can think of is that the generator may have become
&gt; &quot;depolarized&quot; or is otherwise FUBAR.  Any opinions?
