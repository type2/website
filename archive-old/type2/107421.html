Subject: Replacing Valve Guides

Hi Volks!

	I just got back from a 400 mile trip and now my valve guide
tubes are leaking. I know this is normal for a bus, but I just reworked
them about 3500 miles ago with all new rings (all 16 of them) and they
were all set in and not leaking.

	I had just done a tune-up on my bus before the trip(valves, oil,
timing, spark) and the tubes weren't leaking then. I got to my
destination and my bus was still dry more or less on the underside. On
my way home I stopped at a Stop-n-rob and got some gas. I did my normal
walk around the bus checking tires, oil, and making sure no dead cats in
tow (another story for another day - I do like cats - so no animal
cruelty people spam me about the dead cat) when low and behold I have
twin oil marks on the ground just below my valves. 

	I crawl under my bus and check my valve covers to make sure they
are tight and that's when I see the oil coming from around the valve
guide tubes closest to the engine. I proceeded to grab my trust
channel-locks and give them a tight tug  and wiggle to make sure they
were in tightly.  So far no more oil, but was that a start of something
else going wrong or is it possible for them to work loose after a long
bumpy trip?

	I would appreciate any and all help you bus guys have and just
hope I'm not on the road to some serious repair.
