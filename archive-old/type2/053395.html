Subject: Re: cooling system for 78 Westy

&gt;unless and until you know your engine better than your own hand, keep all
&gt;the cooling tin stock, then get a sump oil temp guage and make sure it
&gt;doesn't go over 250 max.  (at 260 shut the engine down, NOW!)

I just put a dip stick vdo oil temp sensor in my 78 westy and still have the 
original tin. My temps on the highway (crusing at 65) are running around 260 
and crank all the way up to 275 extended mountain climbs. Does this indicate 
something is wrong with my cooling system? if so where to start looking? or 
just variances in different gauges/sensors?
