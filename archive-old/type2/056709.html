Subject: Engine runs!

Hello dear reader,
We left off the story last night after Steve and I got my '81 Vanagon 
engine started after head surgery.

It was making quite a loud noise which I attributed to an exhaust leak.  
Plus it was smoking like the Marlboro Man thanks to the oil I spilled on 
the exhaust! Woohoo, what a smell!

Anyway, today I pulled the left side heat exchanger thinking my leak was 
there.  I did find a pretty screwed up gasket but after I replaced it 
and re-installed the exchanger, there was no real difference in the 
noise.

So, I said, it could be lifters (they are hydraulic) though I've never 
heard them this loud before (of course, perhaps my ears were fooled 
because the engine was running in a garage and echoing -- yes the doors 
were open).  So I did a quickie valve adjustment and found not one 
spongy lifter like I found when I originally did the adjustment, but 
instead like 5 spongy lifters.  Now THAT could make a racket :-)

So I adjusted everything carefully (due to the spongy lifters) and let 
it run for a few minutes.  I crawled under with the engine running and 
could not detect any exhaust leaks.  After a few minutes most of the 
lifters seem to have pumped up, with the possible exception of 1 or 2. I 
will take it out on the road soon and try to get the others to pump up.  
I gotta let the engine cool down a bit before I can install the lower 
tin and hook up the heat pipes.  Also gotta time it before I go driving 
around in this heat!  Hopefully it will run significantly cooler.

I will also do a compression check when I get done with my drive.
