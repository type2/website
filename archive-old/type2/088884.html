Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell on this

We have one of these electronic ignitions in a bus that is a daily driver,
and we have had really good results with it, but I think that it is a good
idea to carry a set of points with you &quot;just in case&quot;. One day it will be
kaput, as with all things electronic, and it's emergency kit and know-how,
or a tow. Best would be a spare dizzy with points installed. Jan B
