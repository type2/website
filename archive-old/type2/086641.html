Subject: Acid wash primer/sealers

In speaking with the gentleman who is going to be eventually painting
Possum this spring he recommended that I sand the bus down to bare metal
and then apply an acid wash primer prior to spraying a high build primer.
He said that this stuff is usually clear and will help prevent rust from
recurring. Can anyone recommend such a product? I am imagining that this is
essentially a sealer to be followed by a suitable high build primer such as
&quot;fill-and-sand&quot;.

I looked at the POR-15 site and they had some stuff that looked like what I
am looking for but I figured I would as you guys. I think I am going to
call Metalwiz and see what they think.
