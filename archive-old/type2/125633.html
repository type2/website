Subject: Better dash

By the way, here's how you get a better dash:

1. Install a floor lever for the emergency brake out of a vanagon.

2. Create linkages to change the shifter from a floor shifter to a 
short-throw on a swing-able arm, so that you can push it out of the way 
to get through the walk-through. Has to have a locking mechanism, maybe 
linked through a relay to the ignition switch.

3. Wrap the dash in sweeping curve -- just enough so that you can see 
and reach everything, but not so much that it obstructs the 
walkthrough.

4. Put all the space where the emergency brake was to good use.
