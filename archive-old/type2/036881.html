dave,
i say stay at the rest area, i might be dumb and young
but in my experience ive never had a problem at rest
stops sleeping overnight.   ive been acros the country
and back with 2 friends as well as across and back w/
my wife sleeping the majority of the time at rest
stops.   the only concern i have is about cops hasslin
me (no offense to any police listees:) but it has
never happened.   the way i look at it, people look at
people driving busses to be poor hippies, so they have
no reason to rob me:)   i say go cheap and sleep where
you may.   the vw westies web site also has a list you
can look at of vw bus people all over the country and
there may be some in the area of your sleepovers, drop
them a line.   i did that with a guy in minneapolis
for a concert and he was super nice about it.   hope
the trip goes great.

&gt; I'm planning on taking a trip in my 77 westy the
&gt; last week in April.
&gt; I'm in Buffalo, NY and I'm going to Daytona Beach,
&gt; FL.
&gt; 
&gt;     I'm trying to go as cheap as possible, and one
&gt; of the guys going
&gt; with me suggested that we stop at a rest area along
&gt; the thruway for the
&gt; night.  I'm worried about how safe it would be to
&gt; park there all night.
&gt; Specifically, there are two in North Carolina, north
&gt; of Charlotte on Rt.
&gt; 77.  Anyone from around there know about those
&gt; stops?  Are they deserted
&gt; pieces of woods out of b-movie horror reels, or nice
&gt; modern rest stops
&gt; with landscaping and restaurants?
&gt; 
&gt;     Also, I've got to change my oil there, because
&gt; that's near the 700
&gt; mile mark.  Is that ok for a long trip, or should I
&gt; change it more
&gt; often?  What else should I do before my first long
&gt; trip in my bus?
&gt; 
&gt;     One more thing.  Is anyone going to be around
&gt; Daytona Beach April
&gt; 21-30?  I'll be camping on Ormond Beach (hopefully).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
