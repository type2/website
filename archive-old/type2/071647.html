Don't fool yourselves, if you are walking the swap meet row after row, and you
find the part that you have been looking for all season, your gonna stop and
ask where the seller got it and how??? And if he tells you that he stole it,
your gonna put it down, and that is if he tells you. I bet not, you are gonna
think, 
&quot;The last poor SOB is really losing out on this, I feel bad for him, but I
really wan't one bad&quot; And how are you gonna tell, if he doesn't kindly let you
know, that you are purchasing stolen goods. And if you don't buy it, the next
guy will. Just keep a better eye on your &quot;investment&quot;
               
PS  How does a fella keep a roof rack on his bus without it walking away?
