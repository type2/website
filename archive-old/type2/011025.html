&gt; Some of you might remember me.  I'm Erik Meltzer from the city
&gt; of the world's oldest Volkswagenwerk, Braunschweig/Germany,

I remember.  From time to time I see your messages posted
to the automotive groups in USENET.   Welcome back to the
type2 list.

Cheers,

Erik!

Guten Tag!

OK, back to American (the English will never let us call our speech &quot;English&quot; 
). Welcome back! You helped name my bus - Erfolkswagen - and it is still 
running well. I also have acquired a 1980 Vanagon Westfalia in great shape. 
It is good to see your name again on the list. I also asked about &quot;paramedic&quot; 
in German and you mentioned &quot;sanitater&quot; but that it had a military &quot;feeling?&quot; 
to it. I was looking through a book involving military history-yes, I am one 
of those odd people who actually enjoy &quot;History&quot;- and saw a picture of German 
military medics identifying them as &quot;Sanitater Truppe&quot; or close to that. 

Thanks again for the help in the past and I hope to email more in the future.
Dana
