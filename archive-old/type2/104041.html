Subject: Converting a 1800 FI to dual carbs?

I have an 1800 FI motor out of a 1975 type 2. I would like to put it in my 
72 Van but as a dual carb system, which I prefer. How much work is involved 
and how is the performance affected?

I already know that I will need to change some of the engine tin, to 
accommodate the dual carb springs. What else?

Thanks, Phil.
