&lt;&lt;...that there is a special ring that fits on a bus trany
that is about four inches wide and can be used to put a starter on an
engine that is on the bench or ground and started&gt;&gt;

What you are looking for is a bus bell housing from the tranny.  I have one
and it works great.  Just bolt up the starter, hot wire the coil and stick
the fuel line in a gas can and fire that baby up.
