&gt; Hey I've noticed over the years that alot of bay window buses have a
sag in 
&gt; the rear end. Whats the deal with that? My 77 had it and I figured
it was the 
&gt; heavier 2 liter motor, but I'm noticing my 71 with it now and wonder
about 
&gt; it. Anyone know what goes on here?

All correctly adjusted busses are a bit lower in back than in the
front when parked and unloaded.  The reason is that it is expected
that a driver will always be in the bus when it is being driven, and
that driver will only load the front suspension.

With age, busses can sag a bit more, and the common solution is to
readjust the torsion bars.  Bentley has a good procedure for this, but
be sure to adjust only to the stock settings.  Your torsion bars are
already pre-sagged, so you don't have to put any additional pre-load
on them.

Optical illusion can also give you the impression that the bus is
sagging.  It is impossible to see the horizon from the rear window of
a late model bay (don't know about pre-71s, though).  The belt-line as
viewed through the rear view mirror can also make the bus seem to sag.

The best way to check your bus is to park it on a level surface and
put a level on the door sill of the sliding door.  Have a 170-pound
friend sit in the driver's seat.  If the level shows level you are in
good shape.
