  Thanks Kim. I am in Hemet, Calif. Like I said though, it could be a ways off. I want to finish the interior first, but I'm going to have to do some welding. The PO drilled a bunch of holes for a bench that didn't belong there. After that, I'm going to paint/treat/insulate my bus (affectionately known as Victoria). Then it's curtain time! =0)
  My main concern with the curtains is how to hang them. I'm going to check out a rod kit from ZProducts, and also check out an RV supply.

peace &amp; harmony,
James 68 Std.
