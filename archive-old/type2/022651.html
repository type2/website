Subject: Importing a vehicle (caution!!)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I will say this once for everyone and trust me I know this first hand.  
Absolutely no German to U. S specifications can or will be accepted by the U. 
S. Customs as of 
Sept 15, 2000.  Any dealer trying to say otherwise is also depriving you of 
your hard earned money.  Vehicles must now be converted at time of entry to 
the U. S.  This means they have to be bonded and or signed for by a reputable 
licensed converter.  Please check out the web link below and don't hesitate 
to drop a line before you spend a pfennig. (German penny.)  I live and work 
over here and right now the only vehicles allowed to leave minus conversion 
are 66 and below no mods. 74-66 may be required to meet bumper and emission, 
or if vehicle conforms over 60% already no changes.  DOT glass tires doors 
etc.
Peace Out
Rick
