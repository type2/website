Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

Only half way seriously...

What's to stop one from &quot;building&quot; a bus from &quot;parts&quot; around a salvaged 1979
dashboard?

&gt; My wife INSISTS that we buy a brand new Brazilian Volkswagen Bus. I told
&gt; her I didn't think it was possible because they don't meet US safety and
crash
&gt; test ratings. Is there ANY to buy one and bring it over to the states?
Even
&gt; if it isn't legal to drive on the street, can I still bring one over? (and

&gt; then maybe work something out in one of the states with more LAX
registration
&gt; laws?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

You &quot;might&quot; be able to bring one into the country for &quot;display or show&quot;
purposes, but you'd never be able to register it for street use. It doesn't
come with a vehicle compliancy certificate certifying that it meets ALL
the rules and regs for the USA...Importing a legal car into the country is
difficult enough... ;-(
