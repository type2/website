&gt; Exactly the point I was trying to make......I wasn't really commenting

&gt; loving revision of the beautiful original &quot;splittie&quot;.  What most VW
&gt; enthusiasts were hoping for was a modern updating of a classic, not
&gt; something that looks like a troop transport vehicle from 2085.
&gt;  Actually, if you look at the dimensions, it is bigger than the Honda
&gt; Element and most large minivans.

I don't think that the NB was a &quot;loving revision&quot;.  It was a cosmetic
reskinning of the Golf.  The New Microbus is the same story, a cosmetic
remake of an existing platform.

The major problem today is the predominance of &quot;form over function&quot; in
marketing.  Does anyone believe that the &quot;Dune&quot; concept vehicle will
actually perform in sand?

At least the Mini was a purpose-built vehicle.  It does pretty much what
it was designed to do.  We almost bought one for my wife, but then the
Scion came along and ended up being better than the Mini...
