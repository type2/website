To anyone that has followed this thread so far....

Well after 5 hours of frustration a friend and I made the hitch. It is not 
pretty and will need some modifications before the rear bumper will fit back 
on, but it works. 

If anyone remembers the theme park in the North Carolina mountains called 
&quot;The Land of OZ&quot;, you will remember a chair lift &quot;Balloon&quot; ride. Made it out 
of the metal that made one of the chair lift towers. 

The rear of the bus frame members that the rear motor mount hooks to has 
three factory threaded holes behind the bumper mount holes, up on the 
vertical side. I do not know why they are there. We cut two 2.5 X 6 inch 1/2 
inch thick plates and made a template for the holes and bolted then on. Then 
took a 1/4 inch thick section of angle iron 3 inches per side and measured 
the distance between the plates. This was cut and bent to made a long U 
shaped peice that was tacked and then removed and welded to the plates. A 
tongue and ball that I had was then bolted to the angle iron. The hitch is 
overbuilt in the material dept but we used what we had, and is very strong.  
The tongue that I had looked plenty long but turned out to be too short to 
get the bumper back on. Will need to fabricate another one about 2 inches 
longer to get it to work right but that is for another night.

Anyone at CYW this weekend can check it out. The chairlift tower had some 30 
year old large frozen bolts that my buddy was going to cut out because they 
had never been able to get them out before. I showed him the wax trick and 
came out with no effort at all. :-)

How have to figure how to wire the trailer lights.
