Subject: Re: AType2 /History Question

&gt;Okay all you keepers of arcane Type2 knowledge. Here's one for 'ya: Why is
&gt;it that the engineers of our little beasties saw fit to install a completly
&gt;functional ashtry, and a 12v. acc. socket, yet no FREAKING cig. lighter.

My '69 has a (looks to be) dealer-installed lighter to the left of the
ashtray.  It has VW emblems stamped into the metal and everything.  BUT it
looks as if the dash was cut with a hole saw to install, which is what makes
me think that it was a dealer-installed option.

It's really handy for me to have it there in case of needing to plug in a CB
or radar detector, or recharge a cellphone.  Otherwise its use is primarily
as a dash decoration.

Happy Fourth (US people only)!
