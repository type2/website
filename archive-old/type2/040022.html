Subject: Failing Brake Booster

Well, it seems my brake booster has died.  I was getting a vacume leak sound
from under the dash and after driving with it for a few days the brake pedal
started getting real hard about halfway down, then 1/4 of the way and now
there is no help at all from my poor old booster.  The leak is not coming
from the hose.  My question is does anyone know where I could get a used but
useable booster?  I don't have the bread to spend $250 on a new one.
Luckily, I just got my bug in running condition so it is not my sole mode of
transportation, but I already miss driving it.  The little one is not too
fond of the loud exaust on the bug either.  Is it safe to drive the van
without it?  I have driven it a few miles since the booster completely died
and I can stop just fine, it just takes a little more muscle.  Anyone have a
parts Vanagon laying around with a good booster?  Thanks
