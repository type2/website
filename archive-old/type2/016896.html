      Never tried one, although I've seen them for sale all over in northern
climes. Everything I've ever read or heard, however, is that they are nowhere as
nearly effective as a real block heater. Which is why I've never tried them  --
plus, where I lived in N. Minn, we had no electric to plug it in to. And really,
a well-tuned engine, a good *big* battery, and a *good* starter is all you
really need, until it gets down to 25-30 below, and there's not a whole lot of
point in going anywhere then anyway.  8-)
       I think I said this before, but I'll say it again. You don't need such
devices, unless you *really* need them, and then you need the real McCoy.  A
real block heater. Don't know of any of the dipstick heaters that would fit in a
Type IV engine anyway. Putting a 1000 watt electric heater in the engine
compartment or under the engine aimed up works pretty well too. People use
propane torches -- *BIG* one, like you see advertised for de-icing sidewalks or
burning weeds, etc -- with a few feet of 6&quot; stove pipe and a elbow, put the
torch in one end and the elbow right under the sump. Don't go away.
