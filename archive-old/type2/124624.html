Subject: RE: [T2] West Coast Core

&gt; I paid over $350 for a set of Mahle's new in the box about 5 
&gt; years ago, from a reputable long term VW supplier, yes they 
&gt; are still in business



FYI, there are Brazilian Mahle P&amp;C sets and German ones. German ones are
quite rare; Brazilian ones less so.
