Has anybody seen under-dash parcel trays for loafs?  Just saw some on a
friend's bus the other day, two pieces (one left, one right) looks like
aluminum, painted black with a woven netting of some sort.  Are these
rare?  Worth anything?  Anybody know who makes/made 'em?  I want some.
Thanks for any help,

Andy
