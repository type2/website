&gt;Does anyone with `77 have one of these in their bus, and would you mind
&gt;writing down what's on it for me?  Thank you!

It reads...

Rim 14 x 5.5
Cold Inflation Pressure
                                    F          R
185 R 14 C 6 PR    30 psi 44 psi
185 SR 14 reinf.     30        40

...the first tire is a commerical tire either LRC or LRD. The second is a reinforced tire like the Continental CR21. If you are running 3/4 loads you can run the rear tires a little less as per Bentley.
