Subject: Carb problems - '73 bus

listees,
	I just rebuilt my engine and carbs and am in the final stages.  I
tried to start it today, got a satisfying 2 second run time and my battery
went dead.  I noticed a strong gas smell, I ran back alarmed.  I noticed
that there was gas running down the outside of the carbs!  It should be
noted that this bus runs on an electric fuel pump now.  

	Anyway after much checking I found that the carbs are filling up
with gas and flowing over while the key is on but the engine not running.
Gas is pouring out of the upward slanted brass pipes that are just above
the choked valve in the intake.  Can someone tell me what is wrong here?
Why is so much gas getting into the carbs?  Did I rebuild them wrong?

Someone help me. Please.
