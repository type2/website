&gt;Hi all
&gt;I have recently aquired a '74 bus and I have some questions
&gt;regarding it. I have found at a local junkyard a sliding door
&gt;window that cranks open(jaulosy sp?). The bus is a 68-72.
&gt;will this fit in my bus. I would like to be able
&gt;to get more airflow to my kids in the back. We are not looking
&gt;for a complete resto but a good functional vehicle so the
&gt;fact that this is not origonal is not an issue.

It will fit.  I have a pair waiting to go in my own bus.

&gt;       Next The same bus has a tighter steering box than
&gt;mine and I would like to know if they are compatable. The guy
&gt;said he'd sell it for $25 if I pull it, and looking at the
&gt;prices of rebuilt ones in RMMW (~ $280) this seems like
&gt;a steal.

I'm not sure about this, but I seem to remember that the steering box
changed around '73.

&gt;       I am familiar with the upright engine but this is
&gt;my first experience with the pancake. what is an easy
&gt;way to rotate the engine so I can check the valves. The
&gt;nut for the alternater is in a space too tight for my
&gt;socket. Do I need to buy an open end of this size?

Yes, or you could just use a crescent wrench.  Don't forget to remove it
before you start the engine (I do this a lot).  You may have to press down
on the fan belt with your other hand as you turn, if it slips.

&gt;Is it a 22mm?

I think it's 19mm.
