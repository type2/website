Subject: Generator Removal Uhhh!

--part1_7c.23130455.29a13dfc_boundary

Hello Everyone--

I emailed the list about two days ago with my troubles removing the intake 
manifold in my 71 1600dp engine...well I am still at it believe it or 
not...and I am on the verge of Losing it! I am still in the process of trying 
to remove my generator so I can slide the intake manifold out.
I have removed the four bolts on the front of the Generator Plate, removed 
the Generator strap, removed the belt, removed the 36mm nut behind the shroud 
that I assume attaches the Generator to the fan, and I thought that was all I 
had to do...and the thing would come out and up...but it seems snagged on 
something and I sure don't want to force it. I keep reading about some 
Thermostat attachment but Where is it?
Thanks for your help.....I am attempting this process with the engine still 
in the bus...just so everyone knows.

Sincerely--
Adam Correa
