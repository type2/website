Subject: VW Trends sales call?

Folks, 

Got a call last night from someone representing VW Trends who
claimed that I was a &quot;preferred subscriber&quot; and that they were offering 
to extend my subscription to VW Trends for 3 years for $1.25/issue.

Presumably because the rates were about to go up....hmmmm...

They lady was very pleasant and said they would send me a form...they 
did not ask for any money or cc numbers over the phone(good).

Anyone else out there get a call like this?

Cheers ,dave
