Subject: Re: Axle Nut

Hey Jen, I got my 46mm socket from RMMW for, like, $7.00 or something like
that.  My torque multiplier was a 200 lb man standing on a cheater bar
a little over a foot from the center of the nut.  (217 ft-lbs would be
200lbs applied at 1.085 ft from the center of torque.  just divide your
torque value by your weight to get the correct distance from the center of
the socket).  Make sure your breaker bar is horizontal to get the correct
force on it.

It ain't exact, but it's pretty darned close.  Actually, it IS exact, in
theory.  But then, if your torque wrench has been used often without
calibration, it's probably off that much too.

10,000 miles later, no ill effects.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a 46mm
&gt; nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb
&gt; torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use with it
&gt; other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for that
&gt; with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
&gt; around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our local
&gt; stores.
