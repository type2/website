&lt;&lt; You're across the river from the bus? Why not go have a look at it? It 
might

be a good deal for that price and do you want to see it get scrapped if it's

See also Peter Egan (of Road &amp; Track fame) for one of his columns:
Great Clothes Line Tows...
(And yes, in my younger and more immortal days, I towed an MGA with
various and sundry non-OSHA approved devices from Schenectady, NY
to NJ under cover of darkness...Recommended? No... :-)
On the other hand, If you've got a Bus and AAA just hang your plate
on the &quot;new&quot; Bus and have it towed &quot;home&quot; (But you didn't hear it here)
