Subject: Transmission issues.


Hi  everyone.
I have a few questions regarding some transmission issues i've been
experiencing. 

'74 bus with '75 EFI 1800cc, stock '74 tranny

First off, my tranny grinds shifting into 3rd, upshifting or
downshifting. Its a bit more violent upshifting but thats just due to the
RPMs. I know that my clutch cable is in good adjustment/health. So im
thinking this is a syncro problem.... my old bus did this in almost all
gears so compared to that this is great. How long can I last like this?

Secondly, I can't seem to downshift into first or second until im almost
completely stoped. This is really annoying in traffic. What I do is when
I'm declerating in third I hold the shifter over second with slight
pressure on the shifter in the direction of second gear. When the bus
slows enough it shift right it but not  before i slow to about
5-10mph. This means that I am doing a lot of accelerating in 3rd which I
really shouldn't be doing. What is causing this?

A question&gt; I want to correct this problem. No matter what it takes.
I have access to a '78 bus that is an automatic with a rebuilt auto
tranny (blown engine). Would it be easier/more cost effective to just get
a new/rebuilt tranny than do do this conversion? I've never dealt with an
automatic bus before. How hard is the &quot;manaul-&gt;auto&quot; conversion? (I know
it usually works the other way, auto to manual:) wisely so )


 Is  it the same driving an automatic bus? I can't fathom that. 


Eddie Goodwin
