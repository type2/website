Subject: [T2] Rebuild woes
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Last tune-up, I discovered #3 compression was _at_ 95 while all others were 120. 
 

1600 DP

I got around to pulling the engine yesterday and pulled off the head, but 
could find nothing visibly wrong with it.  ?????  I put another (used, but 
good) head on, and now I cannot get #3 exhaust to adjust.  The adjustment 
screw is all the way out and the valve stem is all the way against the 
rocker.  This cannot happen!   Pushrods are well seated in all rockers.  
Should I grind that one rocker down?  I'll try putting the old head on 
tomorrow and see if it does the same thing, but I hesitate to put the engine 
back in with the head that I thought had a sticking valve.  This is 
perplexing.
