Subject: [T2] plug wire resistance values

This Spring, I rebuilt a 1776 in my '71 Westy  and I've been driving it for
three months. It idles very nicely but seems a bit light on  power and has
an occasional miss.

I bought a CDI and a Petronix , both of which I hoped to install this
afternoon.  As a start,  to gain insight into the miss, I took the time to
measure the resistance of each plug wire.  I had done this earlier on a
1600 which I am also rebuilding.  On the 1600, I measured values around
1Kohm for each wire.  Today,  I got a value of 3K on one wire and values in
excess of 20 Mohm on the others!

These are a set of $39 Berg wires that have been in use for maybe 1000 miles.

I would appreciate knowing if any of you routinely measures the resistance
of his wires and, if so, what values are normal.  On the one hand, there is
something very wrong with a set whose resistances vary by so much. On the
other hand, I'm stumped by the fact that the bus ran at all. It easily made
65 mph.

Thanks, Jack
