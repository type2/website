Subject: Westfalia Plastic t-molding

I've posted this info. before, so it's probably in the archives somewhere.

Woodworker's Supply
1108 North Glenn Road
Casper, Wyoming  82601

1-800-645-9292    24 hrs., 7 days/week

This is their home office -- they have outlets in New Mexico, New Hampshire, 
and North Carolina as well.

They carry tee-molding [their spelling] in several sizes and colors and 2 
basic styles.  They also carry a special molding bit for cutting the slot to 
hold/retain the tee-molding if you're building your own cabinets.

The catalog I'm referring to right now is #134, and the tee-molding is on page 
56.

They list &quot;white&quot; in 13/16&quot; and 1-1/4&quot; widths, &quot;tan&quot; in 13/16&quot; width, and 
&quot;Monterey sand&quot; in 1-1/4&quot; width.

A 50' roll of 13/16&quot; lists for $12.95, a 100' roll for $24.95, and a 1,500' 
roll for $329.00.

A 50' roll of 1-1/4&quot; lists for $15.95, a 100' roll for $28.95, and a 1,000' 
roll for $255.00.

From reading their catalog I get the impression that if they don't have 
exactly what you need they'll try and find it for you.....
