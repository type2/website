Subject: Re: Need information on Oberg oil filter on 1600 DP

Try a Netscape search on 'Oberg oil filter'.  I got about a hundred hits in
ten seconds.  Including the address of the manufacturer.  Instructions for the
care and feeding of the beast are also in 'How to Hot Rod Your VW' published
by HP Books.

The World Wide Wait is a fabulous tool.  USE IT!
