Hey there volks,

My 78 bus was an auto too. I found that the idle was set way to low
for an automatic. I think the spec is 950 rpm, but I could be wrong
(the bentley,muir and haynes are in the bus). Someone might have set
the idle to the specs for a 4spd bus, which is lower. 

The other thing to look out for is vacumme leaks. I couldn't get my
78 to idle higher, by adjusting the idle screw. Drove me nuts, as i
thought is might be the aux. air value, etc, etc. Ended up being the
connection to the brake booster line. Fixed that and it idled like a
champ, and didn't stall at stoplights anymore.

Hope this helps,
