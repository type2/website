&gt; &gt;According to Those Who Know, honing cylinders and re-ringing is a Complete

&gt;Who says this?  I have a friend that just did the hone/ring replacement dance and his engine runs like a top.  Great mileage and compression, no oil consumption.

Same results...mine were rehoned after 30k miles because the engine sat for several years near the ocean and was not properly prepped for storage (oil in cylinders etc) so the walls rusted.
