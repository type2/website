Thanx, I'll check there.

He said that he was having a problem with a &quot;flat spot&quot; when stepping on the gas.
So, he disconnected it to check for vacuum leaks. So, I hope that there's a spot
to plug it in somewhere, as there is NO brake boost at all. VERY stiff pedal.

&gt; &gt;I've got a similar problem with my '72 bus.
&gt; &gt;The guy I bought it from told me that he disconnected the vacuum hose
&gt; &gt;to the Brake vacuum booster, but he didn't tell me where to look for it.
&gt; &gt;I checked the boost at the brake master cylinder and all the way under
&gt; &gt;the bus, but I can't find WHERE it plugs in to the engine.
&gt; &gt;This bus has a single carburetor. Does anyone have a photo or a sketch
&gt; &gt;of the connection at the engine?
&gt;
&gt; On a stock 72 engine, the connection goes through the front (Front Is
&gt; Front) engine tin on the lower right (passenger)
