&gt; Does anyone have experience with the Mallory distributors and ignitions?

i have a mallory adjustable dual advance in my bus, it is not the unilite,
but rather a dual points unit that i fitted with a crane xr700 optical
ignition pickup. my setup is functionally identical to the mallory unilite,
but i bought the distributor new on ebay for 25% of the unilite model. the
xr700 i had already.

it is a very good unit. timing is rock solid, and the advance curve - both
the vacuum and mechanical - is completely adjustable, which is nice. the
quality of the unit itself is very good, and spare parts are readily
available, as most of them are common to many mallory distributors currently
in production.

the only drawbacks are that you must re-index the distributor drive pinion
to make the vac advance canister clear the breather tower on the case, and
that the cap and rotor cost more than bosch.
