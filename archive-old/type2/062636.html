Hi Eddie,
        Their are 2 UPullits outside of Portland, they have a few
70-71 buses, a late 60's, and a few Vanagons.  Its been awhile since
I've been by any of them, But an afternoon of scouting and walking you
would probably be able to hit most of the places.  There are no
engines in any of the busses.

        Also in Portland the shop Always-Vdub is in the SE quadrant of
town, they are in the book.  They've got lots of dirty parts (and some
new ones too), but they are pretty friendly.

        What do you need?  I live in Portland, why don't you give me a
call when you get here (503) 287 - 1084.  Things are a little hectic
(one  month old baby!!! and lots of trips being taken and grandparents
a visiting:), so I don't know what I'll be free to do, but who knows.

take care,
        brandy
