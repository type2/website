A while ago the Brake warning light saved me when after going through to many 
puddles, they shorted out the eletrical connection for my brake booster, I 
still had brakes, just not power assisted, unfortunately I noticed the light 
AFTER i ran a red light since I wasn't prepared for non-powered brakes all of 
a sudden.

&lt;&lt; Not necessarily.  You really don't want to see the light any other time.
 Yes, it does tell you when the parking brake is engaged on the later
 Buses.  But it also tells you when there is a serious pressure loss in
 the brake system.  If there is such a pressure loss, it will light up
 when you push the brake pedal.  Of course, you won't need the light
 because as you find the pedal going all the way to the floor and bus not
 stopping, the light will be superfluous :-) &gt;&gt;
