Subject: [T2]Fan Pulley type 1 motor

On a type 1 motor the generator fan pully(12 volt) i am finding little on this...
   
  how much should it, just the back plate shake back and forth on the threaded rod...?
  this one is rubbing the generator and seems to be warped when ran giving off a bad metal ball rolling sound....
   
  also the back plate shakes back and forth a pinch with belt and all off...and i can pull it way out before it stops???? 
   
  looking in the bentley i found little or looked over alot or little...?
   
  also looking in the muir found installing etc.. but nothing about how the fan pulley comes off except something about using a screwdriver to pry it off ??? does that sound right? and nothing about how it suppose to fit is it suppose to have a slight shake in it or suppose to fit the rod like a glove..?(&lt;my thoughts is its suppose to be tight LOL)
   
  so looks like after all i am going to need a new fan pulley? sounds like?
  all along i have thought it was the fan shroud rubbing the fan and alignment ,...
   
  that shakey back plate though dont look right..?
   
  its taking me four shims on outside to get belt tight ,,,, (NEW BELT)
  also the front plate has a small hair line crack next to the hole and the insides of the hole where it slips on looks to be pretty ruff metal... like maybe its worn out also??
   
  if so i got to add this to my bus depot order...tonight ......~!~
   
  also one more thing is without belt on there and turning pulley with or without the plates together the plate only rubs and makes that sound in one spot....top right side of pulley...
  i can although pull the plate (back one ) out and get no noise what so ever....
  to em the back plate slides out way to far and wiggles way to much on the threaded rod.. again knowing how to get this off to change ot another if this sounds like the problem..?
