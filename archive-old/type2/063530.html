Subject: Original bus art

It's been a while since I've seen any truly original bus art... unless 
you count the quadrillion stickers on a local van (I think it's all that 
holds it together).

Tonight Judi told me a van that showed up in their parking lot 
yesterday. This particular van has a oil splattered rear end, and was 
sitting w/ small puddles underneath. On the side, peering around the 
corner at the engine compartment, is a life sized Alfred E. Newman.

&quot;What, me worry?&quot;
