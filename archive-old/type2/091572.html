&gt; OK, PLEAAAAASSSEEE correct me if I am wrong, but is the Pilot bearing not
&gt; found inside of the flywheel gland nut?? And if it indeed is, wouldn't buying
&gt; a $9.99 new gland nut be MUCH easier than pulling the pilot bearing out and
&gt; re-installing it? I have been under the assumption that the gland nut and
&gt; pilot bearing are in essence one part. Can any of you experts enlighten me?

On a type 1 it is part of the gland nut.  On the type 4 it is inside the
end of the crankshaft, as the flywheel is bolted to the crank with several
bolts.
