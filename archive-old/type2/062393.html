&gt;What's the deal with this stuff?  Does it work?  Am I doing something
&gt;wrong?  Is it intended for use on only the lightest of surface rust?
&gt;Is there anything that works better?
&gt;
&gt;Any advice for rust removal welcome!

We have used Permatext Extends on many vehicles, including the Westy
with great results. Grind off the surface rust then spray on the 
Extends. It causes a chemical reaction that changes the rust. You end
up with a black hard surface on the bare metal. Doesn't seem to 
affect the paint either.
