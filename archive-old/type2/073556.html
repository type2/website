Perhaps the manifold boots are leaking. (Where the center section fastens to the end castings.) A bit of work to change, but has to be done.

&gt;  Starting about a week ago, the bus started to stall out-especially when braking.  It eventually got to the point were it wouldnt idle.  Now it doesnt idle at all.  I suspected a leak in the brake vacuum hoses because it would mostly stall when braking, but when i plugged the nipple on the intake manifold, the problem persisted.  I blew air through the idle screw hole and idle mixture hole-to clean
