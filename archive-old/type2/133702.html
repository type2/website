Subject: Re: [T2] since it's friday!...suicide knobs...

... but in those
&gt;&quot;other&quot; cars that are newer the airbags and the knobs get in the way of
&gt;each other...

I have a suicide knob on my '03 Ford because I drive with handcontrols.  It 
and I may be two knobs that I hope never get in the way of the airbag!  Now, 
back to sanding the rust off the '75...progress bit by bit is still progress 
: ).
