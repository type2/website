Subject: Miles per gallon

I want to thank all of you for your responsiveness to my mileage
question.  This is probably the first list I've joined (I subscribe to 6
or7) where my lack of sophistication about the subject (the obvious
reason most people join an informational list, such as this) wasn't
treated with disdain by the more &quot;learned&quot; on the list.  Even reading
the other questions and answers, it's obvious that everyone is there to
learn, teach, and, in general, to participate.  Thank you again.
