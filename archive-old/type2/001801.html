When I put a stereo in a bus, I like to hook them both to a constant 12V
source so that I don't have to energize my coil just to listen to my radio.
The fuse box has lots of tabs with constant 12V

&gt;   I'm trying to install a stereo into my roommate's '71 bus.  I have
&gt; pounded, ground, and otherwise jammed the stereo into the dash, but I am
&gt; having problems with the wiring.  Could someone tell me what I should
&gt; connect the &quot;Constant power&quot; and &quot;Ignition/power&quot; wires to?
&gt;
&gt;   Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;   Brian
