Gentlemen,

I am cutting slack because the script that is supposed to attach the
charter to new subscriptions still isn't working, and some new subscribers
may not have the word, but posting off-topic (non-bus) messages is a BAD
THING (tm)  This includes bikes, bugs, chevys and fords.  sorry.

                           H Steven Dolan
