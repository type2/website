&gt; &gt; when a spec says .009 it usually means there are tolerances such as
&gt; &gt; .007-.011 blueprinting means EXACTLY .009

&gt; Having been a machinist for 14 years I can tell you there is no such
&gt; thing as &quot;EXACTLY .009&quot;

since I started as a model shop machinist and went back to school and am
an engineer.  so I knew what I was saying, however this is not a machinist
site. and was trying to explain blueprinting not machining...

&gt; Tolerance windows exist because they work, the edge of a tolerance
&gt; should work just as good as the nominal size.

and blueprinting makes the tolerance window much much smaller, remember I
said I had my engine 1gram balanced, so the tolerance is one gram.  etc.
