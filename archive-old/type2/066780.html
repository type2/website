It should be obvious to every one that I respect Thom for the work that he
is doing on the '54. I was kidding him because I just know the amount of
effort that he is putting into it. Actually it seems like he is making
pretty good progress on it.
Go Thom!

I agree with the line in the sand thing. Everyone has to make their bus
their own. A good example is Blue Nelson's Dormobile which has a lot of
subtle mods~ alot of which seem better than stock. Blue has grabbed best
camper two years in a row at the California Classic in spite of being &quot;less
than stock.&quot;

BTW: Air Conditioning back on at the &quot;Rusty Ranch&quot; &lt;in the house&gt; after a
week of no-go in 110F heat. Phew~!
