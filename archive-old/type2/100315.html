Subject: RE:ignition switch and lock problems

It certainly sounds to me like the problem in the first case that the 
problem is the switch.  It;s a pain to change, but worth it.  I agree with 
the recommendation to NOT rewire it.  How many times have we all had to sort 
throu &quot;rewiring&quot; on somebody's VW?

In the second case, I'd clean the lock with electrical cleaner from the 
electrical supply store.  Get a non-residual cleaner, not the crap that 
radio shack sells.  Spray, let set, spray again.  After it dries, lube with 
Tri-flow.  Don't use graphite.  It bonds with the VW grease to form 
something akin to a cross between glue and concrete.  I would think a 
code-cut key would improve things.  If you want to get one without pulling 
the ignition, there's a pretty good chance I can decode your existing key 
from a scan and generate a new key back to factory specs.

Let me know if either of you need more information.
