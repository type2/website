&gt; Anyway, the &quot;Adjustment Data Table&quot; that came with the rebuild kit
&gt; listed
&gt; the following vehicles as having this carb.  This is for the benefit

&gt; those wanting to do a junkyard search.
&gt; 
&gt; 71 Capri 2L, Pinto 2L w/AC
&gt; 72 &amp; 73 Capri-Pinto 2L, Capri 2.6L
&gt; 74 Bobcat-Capri-Pinto 2L, Bobcat-Mustang II-Pinto 2.3L,
&gt; Capri-MustangII 2.8L
&gt; 75 Capri-Mustang-Pinto 2.3L
&gt; 76 Bobcat-Pinto-Capri 2.3L

Be aware that there are many versions of this carb, from relatively
simple (but nowhere as simple as a stock Solex) to versions that are
virtually unrecognizable for all the smog gizmos layered around them.  
Many of these carbs on F*rd products have a coolant-operated choke,
some have electric.  I had a particularly bizarre holley/weber model on
a P*ntiac Astre (clone of a Ch*vy Vega, but with an iron-block engine)
that neither the GM dealer or I could get to work right.

Don't expect to simply strip off the smog gear to have a &quot;plain
vanilla&quot; 5200.  They made a lot of changes to the basic body to
accomodate all those gizmos.

The general rule of thumb is that earlier carbs are simpler, but of
course earlier carbs are also more likely to be worn out, twiddled
with, or otherwise abused.  It might be worth the extra money to avoid
the frustration and buy a new carb!
