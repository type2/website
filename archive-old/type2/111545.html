Subject: Clutch Replacement

Volks,

Well the new clutch is in, but I am regarding it as &quot;sacrificial.&quot;  In
addition to the dead clutch disc the flywheel, pressure plate, and
throwout bearing were toast.  The clutch kit I had contained a new
pressure plate and throwout bearing, but I had no way to deal with the
flywheel, so i threw the new parts in and buttoned it back up.

Both Tom (of Tom and Thanh) and Mark Dearing mentioned this possible
problem beforehand and I knew it was not just possible but likely. At the
same time, I had to work the repair in my alley and had to get it done in
one day without a backup flywheel to have ground and on hand.  So I will
push this until it dies and go get a spare flywheel and have it ground to
be on hand in 6 months or so when I do this again (Whee!)

My thanks to Barry Burneskis who showed up this afternoon to help with the
balancing act that is engine installation.
