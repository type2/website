   Yeah, I work in one. 8-) But most libraries don't have a lot of the
books I have, or need at the moment I need them. Like recently I'm
reading &quot;The Book of Druidry&quot; and keep coming across references to
things that I vaguely recall from other books I have and want to check
upon that very moment, which, at home I can do. Or say I get a yen for
reading some of Mary Oliver's poems some night before bedtime. 
   As for getting internet access in our library, forget it -- if you
don't have a student or fac/staff account on our system, you can't get
past the login prompt, although we do allow public access for $8 per hr.
But some public libraries do allow public access to the internet. Some
libraries are really into it, others have found that it's more hassle
than it's worth. 
    I guess I'm getting jealous of the folks with the RV's here in the
park. A nice 30' fifth wheel would be the thing if you wanted to live
this nomadic life. OTOH, Steve Roberts (http://www.microship_dot_com ) did
pretty well for a long, long time on a bicycle -- something that I used
to dream about doing too. Sigh! I must just be getting old -- used to
absolutely despise motorhomes, now I want one.
    Actually I have the beginnings of such a thing -- I have a '61 Mack
semi-tractor with a 40' dropbed moving van. I built ramps and a deck in
the rear over the wheel wells so I can drive my Westy up inside. Trouble
is, I've also got six printing presses and related printing junk in
there, lots of tools, etc., which take up a lot of space. And I still
need to do a lot of work on the Mack, it's drivable, but not yet ready
for prime time, especially pulling a trailer. The real drawback for that
rig tho, as I'm finding out, is DOT hassles. If I buy a 5th wheel RV, I
can pull it with my Mack and there's no problem, but then I can't bring
my westy along. Looking like a regular semi, however, means you get
pulled over for inspections, weight checks, etc.
    Someone else just mentioned getting the hightop conversion on a bus
-- I guess you'd have to find one done, or get the parts from a
junkyard, whatever -- or are they available yet?
