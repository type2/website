Subject: RE: [T2] praise for online vendor

&gt;  just wanted to say thanks to Bus Depot for getting my 
&gt; latest order to  me so quickly. i ordered tuesday afternoon
&gt; &amp; got one shipment yesterday &amp; the other shipment today.

&gt; ditto that for me on my last order of parts.



You just made my day.  No, my week.   It's so rare that people take the
trouble to comment when they get good service!

Over the course of the last 6-8 months we've made a real push toward
speedier service.  We're still quoting the standard 7-10 working days
for delivery just in case we have a crazy week, but we rarely need that
long nowadays. When I left the shop at 6 today, orders were getting
packed within half an hour of when they were taken.  And Cheri had all
of the day's email answered by 4.  Things still bog down a big on
Mondays (when there's a weekend's worth of orders and email waiting), or
when a big truckload comes in and has to be unloaded, but as a rule
we're shipping twice as fast as we did a year ago. 

The folks at the shop deserve all the credit, and will be glad to learn
that their extra effort has been noticed.  A copy of your email is
getting posted on the wall at the shop first thing Monday!
