Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum integrity of &quot;biscuits&quot;

Shhh, a little secret: Vacuum is measured in Inches of Mercury. Not psi.....

They should not leak at all. But.... Some dual units have a tiny hole in the
can on the advance side to bleed off vacuum when the throttle is closed. The
retard side should not leak.

Look on the arm of each one. You will see a 3 or 4 digit number stamped into
it. That is the ending numbers of the long Bosch number. It does not translate
to the short number. For your 71, you should have a 211 905 205Q dist with a
07 054 vacuum unit. This would be a vacuum unit with 521 on the arm [1 237 121
521].
It should have an advance range of 2-5 degrees and a retard range of 11-13
degrees.
AN is a 72-73 bug manual trans distributor. It has a 07 102 vacuum unit that
is very close to a bus 521. Vac advance is a little more, 5-8. This is
providing the arm has 889 on it...
AJ is a 71 bug manual trans distributor. It has a 07 223 vac unit. I would not
use this one in a bus. Vac advance is a whopping 9-12 degrees! This is
providing the arm has 969 or 2969 on it.
Email me your arm numbers and I can tell what they fit and what the
advance/retard range is.



&gt; With the insight gained from the recent thread on svda dizzys, I took
&gt; my Mityvac to the garage today, applied 28 psi of vacuum to the
&gt; advance and retard ports on four dual vacuum advance distributors,
&gt; and measured the time it took for the gauge reading to decrease to
&gt; zero.
&gt;
&gt; The results varied quite a bit. For at least one unit, neither
&gt; reading changed in 60 seconds.  This establishes a baseline for
&gt; tightness.  At the other extreme was a unit that (1) would not
&gt; sustain  more than 15 ps even initially, and (2) had this value
&gt; decrease to zero within a few seconds.
&gt;
&gt; Given this, my question is: Are the &quot;biscuits&quot; interchangeable among
&gt; distributors such as AN, AJ , etc, that are almost stock for my '71
&gt; 1600 DP? Some of these dizzys suffer from problems such as wandering
&gt; timing, caused I think by wobbly shaft. So I might want to couple the
&gt; best dizzy with the best vacuum biscuit.
&gt;
&gt; Seems to me that all that is required is that the stroke induced by
&gt; the diaphram on the advance side be the same among all these.
