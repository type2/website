Subject: Early bay in Hamden Ct (Spring glen) &amp; buses as work trucks

Just wondering if anyone on list is the proud owner of a whitish early 
bay with stripes and antique plates  I spotted parked on a side street 
in spring glen.  I was taking a shortcut on my way home from a kitchen 
remodeling job in my 65 Ez camper I'm using as a work truck, and I'll 
be going by there everyday for a few more days.  The couple I'm working 
for are taking me to happy hour at the new little bar that used to be 
&quot;The Olive&quot; tomorrow when I finish hanging the cabinets.  I'll be 
looking like a guy who just finished gutting and rebuilding a kitchen, 
then cleaned up quick on the site for free beer.  I'm pretty sure I've 
mentally catalogued most (very few) buses in my area, but never seen 
this one before.

Just Curious

p.s. IMHO Buses make great work trucks - saw a guy tying up the back 
doors of his econ#line to fit 10 footers while I was trying to find 1st 
gear in the parking lot :)
