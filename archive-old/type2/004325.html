Subject: Update on  Rough idle on 82 westy
Date: Sat, 12 May 2001 11:40:47 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I want to thank all who responded with ideas &amp; encouragement.  I may not
have it licked but I have renewed hope.  I rechecked for vacuum leaks but
found none.  Then on a lark I started twisting the 4 intake runner to airbox
boots.  All of a sudden I start getting a whistling &amp; the van starts running
rougher.  As I turned some more the idle got worse &amp; just died.  I just ran
&amp; got 4 new ones &amp; 2 intack gasket blocks.  I will keep you all informed.  I
may not get it done today.  Thanks again.  You all are great.
