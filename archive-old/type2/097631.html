Typical mig-welding project. Time to go tool shopping !
( Did you happen to note my reference to the upper shock mount bolt in
response to your previous post ? :)
Please go back and buy another shock for the other side.

&gt; The almost two inches or so of metal around the upper mount has sheared
&gt; away from the
&gt;
&gt; rest of the frame.  I am at a loss about what if anything can be done
&gt; about it.
