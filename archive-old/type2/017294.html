Hi Volks,

&gt; The first thing you need to know is that many FLAPS carry parts that are
&gt; rebuilt. These usually are guaranteed forever. This is good.

OK... I'm from up in Canada, so forgive me if it's a regional/US issue; but what
the heck is a FLAPS?  I'm not usually AC (acronymically challenged), but this one
has me stumped.

Pmail response is OK, but maybe post to the list too, since I figure there just may
be other uninformed lurkers out there like myself.

Thanks,
