Subject: Engine repair costs?

I'm looking to buy a VW camper, and have narrowed it down to two, each with 
their own special set of problems...

How much would each cost to repair?

Here's the deal on both of them...

Bus one is a '73 manual...  To quote the current owner: &quot;the engine needs 
rebuilt  because one of the rods broke. there is a hole on the top and back 
side of the block.  but i put lots of new parts on the engine before this 
happened, so there is much that is still usable.  the bus ran well/good before 
that incident.&quot;  How much would that cost to repair?  Is the engine 
salvageable at all, or would I need a new one?  How much would it cost to be 
rebuilt?

The other is a '74 automatic...  It blew a head and the current owner was 
quoted $300 for new heads, and about $250 for labor to get it fixed.  Is this 
a realistic price?  How much more would it cost to get the entire engine 
rebuilt as opposed to merely new heads?

All in all they're basically the same price, though the '73 is in FAR better 
condition, though neither is in horrible condition.
