&gt; ANyone NOVA or Baltimore or DC area have a ring compressor I can borrow??

&gt; Or know where I can get one locally
&gt; 
&gt; TIA

If you are so inclined you can make one. Get some spring steel strapping,
wrap it around your piston with about 1 1/4&quot; to spare. Put a 90 degree bend
in both ends so the bends just touch each other when the band is tight
around the piston. Then you use vicegrips to hold the ends together.

If you are looking to buy, find a kd  or lisle tools supplier and get their
wrinkle band compressor, it is a very effective tool and inexpensive as
well:

For anyone wanting a really nice ring compressor for a lot more coin, see
below. This is the ideal compressor for building VW engines. Other tools
will work fine, but this one is a real pleasure to use.

Hope that helps,
