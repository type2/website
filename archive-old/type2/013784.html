&gt;To install takes maybe 20 minutes, then your done! That's it, nothing else to do. Be sure to order the electronic ignition that fits your distributor and it is easier to work on if you pull your distributor out and work it on a bench. &lt;

A couple of notes here from another happy Compufire camper...
1. When I installed by Compufire a few years ago ('78 Bus), I found that after putting the magnetic disk onto the distributor, the rotor would be a little too high in the ditsributor cap. I fixed this by hacksawing a little of the plastic off the bottom of the rotor. I sawed off about the same amount of thickness as the magnetic disk added.
2. Also, even though you don't have points, you still have an advance mechanism that needs to be lubricated periodically. I try to remember to put a drop of oil in there every few oil changes (just remove the rotor and magnetic disk for acccess).
Good luck!
