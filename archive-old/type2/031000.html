when was the last time you changed the fuel filter?????


&gt; info:  stock 69 westy.  1600 single port, newer brazilian carb, stock

&gt; my problem is that the last two times i have driven the bus, after about
&gt; 30 minutes, it just totally loses power in 4th gear.  the engine starts to
&gt; &quot;buck&quot; i.e., cuts out then revs up.  i was watching the tach last time it
&gt; happened, and it was at around 3200 rpm.  if i slow down to 45 mph or so,


also I had this happen to me once, it turned out to be a pinhole on the
vacumn side of the fuel pump in the line from the tank.

when it got warm and softened up it started sucking air at high RPMs,
drove me nuts and took almost 3 months to find.

good luck

Bob
