Subject: Beaulieu Autojumble (slim VW)

For 2 days every September at Beaulieu (pronounced 'Beeyoo-lee'), a little 
village in the South of England tens of thousands (at least) of classic car 
enthusiasts gather to buy and sell Old Car Stuff and period accessories. People 
travel from all over Europe (and the world) to attend. My parents run a small 
hotel and they are booked up a year in advance for that weekend (the same 
people come from Jersey every year, with perfume for my mum and wine for 
my dad!).

This year was the first time I attended. It was a swap-meet of mind-
blowing proportions. My boyfriend and I walked for 10 hrs stopping once
for lunch, and we just about saw every stand, and had a chance to root 
through but a handful of those. There was a strong British car bias (lots of 
goodies for Jaguar XKs, early Triumphs, Rolls Royce &amp; Bentley), but this 
meant any VW bits were going for alot less than they would at a VW show. 
I don't know about the US, but in the UK people will pay, and expect, crazy 
prices at VW shows. Aswell as every imaginable part &amp; accessory for the
Brit cars, there were generic period accessories such as '40's leather driving 
coats, 50s/60s radios, picnic hampers, cool boxes, etc. Loads of sales 
literature, posters (repros &amp; origs). And of course, cars for sale including a 
couple of fantastic early 1-seater racing cars.

I queued up for 30mins to park in a field and walk to the main grounds. In the
same field as Splitty, was an immaculate early (semaphores, not barn-
door) blue &amp; white Devon? VW bus.  I never met the owner as I arrived and 
left after them.

I bought a period (late 50s/early 60s) Roberts radio which received the
BBC World Service very well in Holland last week. 

I found a Dutch woman with a whole stack of VW sales brochures going 
right back to the early 50's. I bought 3 bus ones (2 in dutch, 1 in english) 
which I will scan in and put on my webpage. They contain some super 
pictures, and such advertising gems as &quot;You can really make yourself 
comfortable in this car. There's space aplenty. No shortage of elbow room 
or leg room. Just stretch out, relax, and take it easy&quot; ..... &quot;Bitter cold
in winter? 
Burning heat in summer? You couldn't care less -- a special, finely adjustable 
system of ventilation plus the built-in heating and defrosting system provide 
comfort on the inside at whatever season of the year.&quot; (from the August '64 
Microbus brochure -- they must have made some fantastic improvements on the
'62 model which I own..... :-)

I met a German couple who have recently bought a disused factory in 
Germany because it has a very rare/valuable old sports car in it (they 
didn't say what). They also, however, found in the factory a whole load 
of interesting VW stuff. They had many brochures, some NOS 100,000km 
badges, some other very early NOS badges, about 10 Rosendaal bud 
vases, some other stuff I can't remember. Unfortunately, he knew his
stuff, and the prices weren't give-aways by any stretch of the imagination.
We bought 2 1957 beetle/bus/karmann ghia Accessories brochures. I
sold one of them at the Holland show for twice what I paid for it (needed
the money!).  I will scan the remaining one in for the webpage -- it is very 
interesting, especially for the vintage perverts with show cars.

Damon found a NOS windscreen washer for a 50's beetle. It looks for 
all the world like a colostomy bag, but he's thrilled with it :-).

That night driving back to Lymington (5 miles from the show, where
our parents live) I nearly crashed on the High Street for there was a
Porsche 356A Speedster (not a replica -- I tapped inside the wheel-
arches but don't tell anyone), a 356C Super, and a newer 911. They
were all from Germany, and absolutely mint. The speedster was black
and immaculate. Later that night, walking to the pub, the sun was setting, 
and we saw them all drive by in convoy, the speedster bringing up the 
rear, roof down, 2 old German boys (in their 60s) in it, wearing white leather 
driving hats (like bath hats with ear flaps).

Trip report from The Netherlands soon. Splitty is still alive and that's
the important thing!
