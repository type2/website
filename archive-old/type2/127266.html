Subject: Re: [T2] DOOR WINDOW REGULATOR 

&gt; Did anyone already have a problem with the &quot;DOOR WINDOW REGULATOR&quot;
&gt; (VWC-211-837-501)? When the crank turns, it's possible to fill that something
&gt; inside is loose.....did anyone try to fix it, or do i need to get e new one?

the regulator is probably stripped and needs to be replaced.
not difficult but it can get a little tricky trying to manouver the bits
around inside the door.

make sure its not just a stripped  handle before you order a new
regulator.
