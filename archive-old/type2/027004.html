&gt;You can't time your 009 the same way you would a stock distributor because
&gt;it is not a stock distributor.

Should I be looking for a vacuum advance distributor then?  I have about 
four unused vacuum ports on the carb.  What was stock?  I guess since the 
engine is not stock for 68 I'm not looking for the 68 set up.  What would be 
the ideal distibutor for my application?  Seems to me that vacuum advance 
would be better for power and economy since the advance curve woud be based 
on demand rather than a fixed, mechanical curve.  I don't know anything 
about these VWs though.  How many distributor choices are there?

In the meatime I will adjust it as you have suggested.  Rev to total advance 
and then set it to 28 deg on the case seam.

Thanks
