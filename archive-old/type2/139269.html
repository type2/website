Subject: Re: [T2] Yep, it's a PCV valve ... sort of

While it's interesting to speculate on the reasons for NLA parts, I'd 
like it if we could focus a little on how to remedy the situation for 
our buses. Maybe there's something I am missing, but I detect a &quot;stick 
your head in the sand&quot; attitude concerning this part.

A non-functioning PCV valve can cause:

Build-up of water vaper in the engine case, condensing and adding water 
to oil
High engine case pressures, leading to oil leaking from seals
Poor idling (if the valve is fully open at idle)
Ignition of crankcase fumes in a backfire (I'm not so much worried 
about this one)

The first three of these are COMMON complaints on this list. But the 
archives suggest that faulty PCV valves are rarely suspected as the 
culprit.

Once again, there is no way to inspect the valve adequately, no way to 
clean it completely, no way to know whether it is functioning as it 
should.
