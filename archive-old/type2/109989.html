&lt;&lt; My only question, and if someone could help me figure it out, I would 
appreciate it, is where would you put the Radiator, I figure you could use a 
radiator cooler, but where do you put the radiator.. I want to invest in a 
VW Bus, but do not like air cooled engines, I want to convert the engine 
over to a jetta or scirrocco 8 valve water cooled engine. but haven't 
figured out where to put the radiator.. any suggestions? Appreciate it...

Case
 &gt;&gt;

The most aesthetically pleasing installation was a custom built radiator
that fit inside a spare tire cover. Mounted on the nose of a bus, it was
backed by an electric fan. IIRC, the plumbing was pretty complex, too,
to prevent 'air locks'...Not a simple thermo-syphon system , at all...
