Subject: RE:  914 decision  :)

&gt;Since my German friend :) lives across the street Ill just rum it across 
&gt;to him and have him rebuild it (hopefully with me present!!!!)

Bear in mind that these motors are a little heavy and more than a little
unwieldy.  You can't just tuck them under your arm and trot around with them
(unless you're a REALLY big guy!).  Even stripped down to the actual engine
(ie. remove sheetmetal, exhaust system, alternator, etc.) they probably
weigh in the vicinity of 200 pounds so figure on some sort of sturdy cart or
wagon to haul it in.

&gt; .1) What kind of heat exchangers would fit the 914( there are ones on 
&gt;there now but not in very good shape cant tell if they are orig or not?)

You HAVE to use bus heat exchangers.  Preferably the correct ones for a 73
bus.  All type IV heads/exhaust ports (except for 79 and newer buses) are
the same.  914 heat exchangers will NOT work.  Unless you want to channel
the exhaust FORward from the engine and put some Corvette-style side-pipes
on there :-)

&gt;2) What kind of exhaust system would fit that bolt config? right now 
&gt;there is a LOUD type 1 exhaust on there. I cant tell if there are three 
&gt;or four bolts to see what type of 914 it is.

Same answer as above - if you use the correct exchangers for a 73 bus then
you use the muffler for a 73 bus as well.  Don't waste you money on the
Empi-brand 2-piece muffler.  They're junk.  If you're going to buy new,
check with Bus Depot and get a GERMAN oem muffler ($159?).

&gt;When I checked the ARCHIVES all I read was that the stock 
&gt;Exchangers wont fit and niether would the exhaust although No 
&gt;alternatives were ever pondered.

What article did you find that in?  If that's what it says, it's dead-wrong
and should be corrected!
