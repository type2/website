Subject: Post-FI tweaking = VROOOOM!!!!

Hi Volks,

This past weekend was the test run for the Westfakia's FI conversion. 
The run from Toronto to Bobcaygeon was uneventful, but the performance 
was... um... not so good.

Since I purposefully selected a backroads route to the campground I was 
able to maintain reasonable speeds, but I only saw 60MPH on downhill 
stretches. Even modest hills threw me back to third gear. The engine 
seemed to run OK when I left the house, but gradually lost power as the 
trip progressed. When I arrived at the campground it would idle OK, but 
it would bog as I let out the clutch and when cold it would stall. I 
vowed not to venture inside the engine compartment until I got home. 
This was a &quot;Vacation weekend&quot;, wrenches were brought along for 
EMERGENCY USE ONLY&quot;. I figured I could nurse it along for a while, and 
if it got really bad I could deal with it when it happened.

So tonight after I got home from work I set out to cure the poor 
thing's ills:

First I pulled the distributor. Rather than measure dwell and advance 
rates on the unknown spare dizzy, I reverted to the 74 DVDA distributor 
with a pre-installed pertronics ignitor.

Secondly,I tightened the hose clamp between the S-pipe and the AFM. I 
don't remember leaving it loose, but I guess I did. Can you say &quot;Vacuum 
Leak&quot;?

Finally, I hauled my 13 year-old son away from MSN chat long enough to 
get him to help me adjust the throttle linkage. He held the accelerator 
pedal up while I tightened the cable. The cable I have is about 2&quot; too 
long... I expect the difference is in the length of the cable shroud 
running between the bowden tube and the engine tin. If I can't find a 
spare FI cable shroud I will simply shorten the cable I have now with a 
clip under the pedal housing.

I then buttoned up the engine compartment, set the timing and took it 
for a spin.

The results were INCREDIBLE.  Powerband is excellent. I got my wife to 
take it around the block, and she was much impressed. *This* is the bus 
I have wanted to drive for over a year now.

Now I'm off to pick up a replacement for the misplaced power brake 
booster line. It'll be nice to be able to stop as well as the bus will 
go.


Happy trails,
