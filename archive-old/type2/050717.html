Subject: [T2] RE: [VB] Westy Cot identification

There are two good sources to answer this question. Go to 
www.type2_dot_com and choose the library then campers and look for a 
heading about cots and a credit to Karl Van Salzen the cot king.

You can also go to http://www.geocities_dot_com/grnmnstr/vw/ and see pics 
and descriptions of all three types.

Happy Cotting
