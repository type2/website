i dont know the VW part number, im fairly sure vw donent make them
anymore the Bosche part number is (at liest per RMMW) 

0 190 600 016 for a AL 75X alternater this alternater is listed from
72-79
0 190 601 006 for a GR 17X alternater this one is listed from 75-79

i have an old regulater from my 72, i thought i fried it when i hooked
the battery up backwards (fortunately the plug fell out) i replaced it
anyyway though and i have a replacement alternater waiting to go in.
