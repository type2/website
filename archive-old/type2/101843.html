Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;hockey stick transmission bushing&quot;

Nose cone bushing is the name for the internal bushing, takes 2


Nose cone seal carrier is the name for the part that sticks out of the nose
cone that holds the seal.

These are made of silicon bronze and the easiest way to get them out is to
use a die grinder and carefully grind them out, I have a special tool I had
made to install them.

The seal carrier can be just tapped out and replaced. 

All the above is easier with the nose cone removed

Subject: [T2] &quot;hockey stick transmission bushing&quot;


All this recent talk about shifting problems and how the &quot;hockey stick
transmission bushing&quot; fixed the problem made me start to think that I
should replace mine.  So I put in the keyword of hockey stick
transmission bushing in several online venders and guess what, nothing
comes back as being found to that description.  I'm guessing Volkswagen
had another name or description for it.  If someone could be so kind to
let me know what VW calls it I would appreciate it.
