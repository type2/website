Hello Scot &amp; list     From my experience  the single Weber gives good power 
,lousy gas milage  , will not run in the cold unless you increase the 
manifold heat 100%. Kadrons work good for a few years but will wear out at 
the crosshafts .  The best were Dellortas ,hard to find now.    Mark Dearing
