Ooops!

I removed the three bolts in the middle - not the center.  My mistake.
Still no joy.

&gt;You do not remove the center bolt. It holds the hub to the crank. Remove
the
&gt;3 bolts around the center bolt, this will remove the fan from the hub.

&gt;&gt; Mates,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In an effort to keep this short:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've a 78 block from which I've already removed the RIGHT cylinder head.
&gt;&gt; Trouble is the left.  I can't get the LEFT head off because the tin
shroud
&gt;&gt; which surrounds the oil cooler is in the way.  The tin won't come-off as
I
&gt;&gt; can't get the bloomin' fan off - though I've removed the big ol' bolt in
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; middle per Muir.  It just won't move!  There ARE four (if I remember
&gt;&gt; correctly) square-headed nuts on the fan, but they reside against the
&gt;outer
&gt;&gt; rim of the fan and therefore can't be turned...
