Subject: Re: [T2] CHT  installation


I  am seriously in need to install a Cyl. Head Temperature sensor &amp; reading
gauge since my '75 bus' engine gets hot easily, up to 165-170 F  (oil sump
heat sensor) on a hot sunny day in bumper-to-bumper traffic here in Jakarta,
and I heard  that a CHT is the most accurate temp. reading &amp; highly
recommended by the experts...  Therefore I would appreciate it if anyone
could describe to me a clear step-by-step instruction on how to install a
CHT sensor &amp; gauge.

    This is the simplest gauge to install. A wire runs from the sensor to
the gauge. That's all. If you want lighting, you can wire a hot from the
instrument wire lighting and ground the gauge. Full instructions for all
VDO gauges are available on their website, www.vdona_dot_com . Look under tech
support.
