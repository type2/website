&gt; The accusation that our motors are mid-1930s design is heard
&gt; from e.g media celebrity Clive 'Dog &amp; Lemon Guide', but is
&gt; essentially misleading because of coure Porsche &amp; VW improved design
&gt; &amp; construction for 4 decades.  (They then lost the plot, resorting to
&gt; water cooling &amp; other blunders.)
&gt;
&gt;

If so then Tatra is gonna hafta return the money they finally got from
VW/Porsche in 1961 for stealing the concept and patented designs of
the T97 in the late 1930's.
