Maybe for some extreme cases. My mileage improved by perhaps 5-10%, which
is nice nevertheless.

&gt;   get me up near 20 mpg on the highway. Bob also notes that the spark
&gt;   plugs can be gapped much wider, does anyone know how much wider?

I increased the gaps on mine from 0.028 to 0.040 and could probably go
even further. It's a trial and error thing.

&gt;   Oh yeah, does anyone know how much this thing costs? Is it in the J.C.
&gt;   Whitney catalog?

Order direct from Universal Corp. and get rid of the middle man :) (Bob
provides address and phone # in a follow-up sermon.) Note that because of
the fuel injection you will need to McGyver some resistors and capacitors
into your circuit. The module comes with instructions and a wiring diagram
explaining all this. Also their tech support is knowledgeable and
friendly.
