Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires&amp;crush space.

&gt; If the front tire mount were extended out from the

&gt; work?

The way that this is done in the auto industry is that the unibody
structure is designed to conform to the demands of styling, aerodynamics,
ergonomics, and mechanical systems.  It is then modeled using some sort of
finite element analysis to determine the points that have to be
strengthened or weakened to provide the correct crushing properties.
Finally, body sections and entire cars are actually crashed to verify the
computer analysis.

The dynamics of a crashing car are incredibly complex, far too complex for
any current analysis method to handle with good accuracy.  What it really
comes down to is a cut-and-try situation.

&gt; &gt; But wouldn't the tire and wheel also serve to spread
&gt; &gt; the impact over a
&gt; &gt; greater area and therefore provide a greater amount
&gt; &gt; of structure to absorb
&gt; &gt; said impact? I thought that would be a good thing.
