Subject: The African Queen -- Revenge of the heater box...

Hi All,

I am about to ask a &quot;DUH&quot; question I think...  The
exhaust inlets on a heater box should have a solid
flange, the flanges aren't supposed to come off,
correct? Both of them do on the drivers side box.

I am thinking that the Dansk box is toast and though
they are just two years old I will need to buy a new
one.  Plase advise this neophyte.

Thanks,
Brian
