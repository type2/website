I'm in the process of dropping my engine and have run into a little problem. 
I got the right carb and linkage off but when I try and get the left one off 
it won't budge at all.  There was orange gasket sealer between the right 
carb and the manifold and I can see a bit of it peeking out from the left 
one. Does anybody have and tricks I could use to get this off?? The gasket 
sealer has them stuck together pretty good.

Thanks,
