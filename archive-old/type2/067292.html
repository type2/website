Subject: '61 Beetle FS (Kentucky)

I know it's not a Bus but ...

I just got off the phone with a fellow VW lover in Kentucky who is 
looking to sell his '61 Beetle.  He lives in &quot;No-Volkswagen-Land&quot; and has 
not been able to sell this locally.  He has found his &quot;Dream Oval&quot; ('54 
Canadian Model) and can't keep both and he wants the '61 to go to a good 
home.

- ---------
1961 Beetle:  Originally from California, bought from a Professor in 
Lexington, KY.  Gulf Blue, 80K miles, no rust at all, never winter 
driven, (jack has never been used!).  He is asking $4500 but will listen 
to offers!  Call Deane Hunter at (606) 473-6671  (Greenup, Kentucky).
- --------

Deane is also looking for any VW enthusiasts in his area (we talked for 
quite a while on the phone), so if you are nearby give him a call.  :-)
