Subject: Re: [T2] beetle muffler on bus

my 2 cents: I gave my girlfriend CO poisoning once from riding in the 
back when I had a beetle muffler and a bad rear hatch seal (for about a 
year I drove that way).  it could have been worse, but it is not healthy 
regardless.  would I use a beetle muffler in a pinch now that I replaced 
the seal? probably.  but someone makes an outlet tube that fits in the 2 
holes and directs the exhaust to the side--this is probably a retrofit 
worth finding.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     thousands of folks have used beetle mufflers with no apparent
&gt;&gt; mortality.  I used to run one with an &quot;iffy&quot; rear hatch seal and my CO
&gt;&gt; detector card didn't detect any excess CO.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; is it ok to use a beetle style muffler on a 70 bus?
