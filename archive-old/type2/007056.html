Ronnie,

Isn't the centrifugal advance curve on the SVDA dist. VERY similar to that of 
the .009?  It seems you should at least get it to work as good as the .009 on 
a type 1 engine just on its centrifugal advance if you time it to the same 
specs.

Did you try setting it for around 30 degrees BTDC (plus or minus a few based 
on your advance comfort level) at 3400rpm with the vacuum line off?

Does the timing light indicate that it's advancing properly across the full 
range of rpm with the vacuum line off?  Idle timing for both the SVDA and 
.009 should be around 7.5 degrees btdc for a type 1.  If the timing light 
shows that the .009 is advancing fully at 3400rpm and the SVDA is not getting 
you the same amount of advance plus a few extra degrees, then something is 
wrong with its springs/weights or the moveable plate is sticking.
