&gt;Is your gauge plumbed with flexible tubing all the way to the front, or did 
&gt;you use rigid tubing for that long run?

I moved my oneway valve up to the front by the booster, then put a Tee in
the line just behind the oneway valve and ran that up to the dash (only
about 6 ft of vacuum hose).  You could also just run vacuum hose from the
back to the front - I tried it through 100ft of 3/8 ID hose and it
registered just fine.  

I agree with those who say it's a valuable gauge to have installed.  Tells
you a lot about your engine - maybe more than any other gauge. 

I get about 15 at idle once it's warmed up, and 20 on decel.  The idle
vacuum depends a lot on your idle speed - mine is at 1400 rpm idle.

Another thing the vacuum gauge is great for is telling you when your engine
is warmed up.  When your engine is cold, clearances are greater and vacuum
is reduced.  As the motor warms up, the vacuum increases.  I start up my
bus and hold the idle at 2000rpm until the vacuum comes up to 15, then I
drive off gently.  This takes maybe 20-30 seconds.

The decel vacuum tells you a lot about your compression ratio.  When I
bumped my compression ratio from 6.7 to 7.0, my decel vacuum went up from
18.5 to 20.  When I bump it again to 7.3 (in the next couple months,
whenever I get around to pulling the engine and tranny) I expect decel
vacuum to go to 21.5 or 22.  If I ever start to lose compression, I will
know immediately because my decel vacuum should drop noticeably.
