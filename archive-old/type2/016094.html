OK,

This raises another question that I really haven't seen much info on.  Are
there any variations of the splitfire, Bosch 4-tip, or other &quot;complex&quot; plugs
that fit the stock head of a type1 engine?

Obviously Bosch makes the W8AP single-tip Platinum plug that is a drop-in
replacment for copper (W8AC).... but is there any other stype that will fit
a stock VW engine to experiment with?

(clyinder ehad temps, not oil temps being referenced)

 Before the update kit and quad tip plugs, the temps were _at_275 to 350.
After 
the kit update it ran _at_250 to 300.  Now it runs 225 to 250 at 60 to 65 mph 
with the addition of the quad tip plugs.
 
 I am using all stock tin and oil cooling, no external oil coolers.  I also 
use synthetic oil.
