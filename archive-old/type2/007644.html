Subject: My Lousy Windshield
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I recently got tired of looking at all those great bullseyes in the windshield of my '69 Westy.  Purchased a WCM seal and found a clean used windshield.  Tried to get things to fit for the better part of three hours and no luck.  I have done this job sucessfully before in a '71 and know the process well enough.  Questions: Are all '68-'79 windshields interchangeable?  I am pretty sure the replacement w/s came out of a '71.  Has anyone had experience with installation using a WCM seal? it seems a bit more beefy than the cheapy seal I used last time.  I can't get the w/s to seat in front of the lip on the top and bottom prior to string pulling.  I tried seating the bottom and pulling the string to seat the seal on the lip at the bottom and then push the top into the channel- no luck. Tried top seating first, then seating bottom- no luck. It seems as though the glass is too tall.  Has this happened to anyone else before?(glass dimensions different)  Should I try picking up a different seal?  I had someone helping push the glass, very hard, had plenty of lube on seal and in the channel.         Pretty Cool Huh,   
                                                            John B.
