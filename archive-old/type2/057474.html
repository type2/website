Subject: CV question (complete axle)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am about to replace the complete axle (CV-CV)on both sides of
my 77 camper, standard.
all of my books are being borrowed, and have not been returned
(so much for being the nice guy).
so , my question is, do I have to remove the wheel? Or can I just
unbolt it and shove the new one in?

I am busy with the bus today (finally no rain), so I don't have
time to search the archives, sorry.

Thanks for your help,
Thom
