I agree. I saw the photos, and it looks as if the seal
is entirely missing from your motor;-( 

&gt;those gaps are letting the air
&gt; pass
&gt; through when it needs to be passing through the
&gt; cooling fan and directed through the oil cooler and
&gt; across the engine. 

Actually, what's worse, is that when you idle at a
stop light, the hot air from your heater boxes/exhaust
will rise up into the engine compartment, so you are
actually trying to cool your oil with air that is
many, many, many times hotter than what you'd see with
the seal in place.


I'd start there, and go through the usual suspects:
timing, carb-adjust, vacuum lines, etc., and go from
there. As a general rule, you should be able to hold
the oil dipstick for at least one minute before it
burns you...otherwise, your motor's running too hot.


Good luck!
