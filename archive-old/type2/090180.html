&gt; &gt; #2,3,4 (green hose)  This hose routs crankcase gases from the EGR box (at
&gt; &gt; the rear of the engine) back into the intake to be burned.  it should
&gt; &gt; obviously not be loose.  Gettign the proper diameter hose in the US is
&gt; &gt; damn near impossible, tho.  Clamps are not good, but the best bet here.

&gt; What is this black box?  I doesn't seem connected to the EGR system or the
&gt; fuel vapor recovery system.?

Richard,

Oh &lt;euphemism&gt; drat &lt;/euphemism&gt;! The danger of posting late at night.  I
meant PCV, not EGR The black box at the center-rear of the type4 engine is
what passes for a PCV valve.
