Subject: 1 more cable question

Alright,  greasing the cables makes sense.  The corrosion issue was
my guess at first.  My intent is to eventually replace all the under
chassis cables.  Might as well do the bowden tube also.  The camper has
127000 miles, ie: lots of shifting!  

The new accelerator cable that I just put in had a four inch plactic
sleeve on it.  The old one that came out didn't have this.  I thought
the sleeve should go at the carb end of the cable but couldn't get it
to pass though the bend near the rear end of the metal tube.  I'll give
it another shot this weekend, but I just want to make sure as to which
end this sleeve goes on.

BTW I 'think' the rebuild could be fired up on Sunday.  Cross your 
fingers for me!
