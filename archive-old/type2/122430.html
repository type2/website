Tony,

You are confusing these plugs with something else, they are not a snake oil
type product. They have real benefits. The most important one is that since
there are multiple electrodes, the spark has several possible paths it can
take, and apparently this improves combustion efficiency. Only one of the
electrodes will fire on any given stroke, but the spark has 3 or 4 paths it
may take. But to re-iterate, the multiple electrode plugs are only
beneficial if you have high output ignition. If you have CDI is when they
can make a real difference.
