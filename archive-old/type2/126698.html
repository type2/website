I don't think so.  There's a lot more than just the engine swap going 
on, here.  You have to deal with the cooling issue.

&gt; Most bizarre engine swap? Toyota v6 into a 67 Mustang. (Helped a
&gt; friend do it actually.) Amazingly, there was a kit out there for that
&gt; swap! I wonder how many Ford fans wanted to beat him up... LoL

Easy by comparison... water-cooled to water-cooled.

Seriously, stick with the VW engine.  Once you get it tuned and running 
properly, you won't have to deal with warm-ups, etc.  Especially down 
there in sunny southern California.
