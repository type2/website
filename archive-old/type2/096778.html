Subject: Horns As Usual

Hiya List,

Seems like all my posts have to do with horns.  Here's my contribution for 
today.......I'm looking for the OEM Bosch horn for a 1970 Bus.  Not an 
aftermarket Bosch but the original from 1970.  I've struck out twice at the 
local boneyards so far.  I'm going to set the Bus up with dual horns and I'd 
like them to be the same.  Does any kind soul out there have one in good 
working order they'd like to get rid of?

Mike
