Subject: starts but dies?  78 westy

Hi!

The bus was running fine before I cleaned and gapped the plugs.  We are taking
a trip next week so I thought I would clean them up.  The plugs looked great
when they came out, good color...

Now the bus is very hard to start and once started will not stay running
without keeping the accelerator 1/2 down or so.  Even then, it doesn't
maintain rpms.  let up and it dies.

I have checked all the vacuum lines and wires, they are all good.  Honest all
I did was clean the plugs?   Anybody have suggestions?  places to start?

TIA
