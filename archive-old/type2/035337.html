Subject: BBB IV &amp; UJJA

At the BBB IV i gave the uncle jerry jess award to Brian of the VTO
club--I give this trophy at my expense to a bus at every show i
attend---- it always goes to a driver type of bus that does Not have--
best paint--best interior--best motor---best what-ever--Just a regular
cool driving Bus----I have received a few negatives concerning the UJJA
that i gave to Brian---So far what few negatives i have received have
been from people who were Not at the show--Is there anyone on this list
who was at BBB IV that feels Brian should not have received the award?
If so that's OK we can agree to disagree---But the UJJA will still go to
the person that i feel has earned it--TWWM, uj
