&gt; Has anyone experimented with using strippable sealant (usually called caulk)

&gt; check to see if it eats aluminum, but it seems like a good idea to me.  It
&gt; works great on residential windows and in the spring you just peel it away.

I use the metal tape used in the housing industry, get it at Home Depot to
seal some of my windows that don't seal tight in the winter,  pull it off
in the summer and it leaves no residue.    looks kinda funky though.

seals on windows is still way down on my &quot;to do&quot; list
