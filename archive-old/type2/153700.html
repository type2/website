Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &lt;Kafertoys_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I just took the #1 exhaust push rod from an engine, I was told was recently
&gt; rebuilt and found it has a grove about 10 mm wide and 2 mm deep about 2.5 
&gt; cm
&gt; from the lifter end.

I am skeptical about 2mm deep.... are the pushrods that thick you could 
actually groooooove them 2mm deep.... anyway ,,, what I was going to say,,, 
I have seen that from weak valve springs,, the valve floats at higher rpm 
and the pushrod wobbbbles .... the amount of flex will determine how wide 
the band of scratches are.. or grove as you put it...  if you continue to 
over rev the valve springs and float the valve... the deeper the damage..

just a guess..
