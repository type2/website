Subject: Re: [VB] point gap - who is right???

Say what?  I've always been told that the point gap on a 009 distributor
needs to be set to .009&quot;...  Have I been getting bad information?

&gt; So ive always thought the 009 point gap should be .016. Thats just always
what ive been told and
&gt; seen in all the manuals, so thats how ive always done it.
