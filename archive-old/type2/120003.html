&gt;If someone wants to get in, they WILL, and you will

I went by this idea when I had a Jeep (much cheaper to
replace anything I had inside, rather than having to
buy a new $900 canvas top if someone slashed it)...
Problem is, this time of year, it not's unheard of in
my area for a homeless person or transient to &quot;shack
up&quot; in an open vehicle for a night or two to get out
of the cold, often causing a lot of damage to the
vehicle in the process - I imagine a bus would be
quite desirable for this!  Since my bus isn't my daily
driver and is kept on the street (no garage), they
could be in there for a week before I would know!
