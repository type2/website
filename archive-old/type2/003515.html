&gt; I am troubleshooting a &quot;gas in oil&quot; problem and read in Bentley that a
&gt; reversal of the 30 and 50 terminals can cause the cold start valve to
&gt; remain open. I would like to see if that is the problem by switching the
&gt; wires. Is this crazy? Will I destroy something if I do this. Thanks for
&gt; any and all assistance.

At the starter solenoid????    Where did you read that? The second wire on
the 50 terminal on the soleniod goes to the double relay and powers up the
fuel pump when you crank the engine.
