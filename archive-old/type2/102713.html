Subject: Re: [T2] Nicknames

Hello All    First off this old bus driver just turned the big 50 . Got to 
thinking about all the buses nicknames,  the one I have had the longest since 
1971 is called the Ghoost, it's a 66 hardtop westy, well over 300K and still 
running . my second 66 hardtop westy made 15 days apart from the Ghoost is 
called Bubbles, It is all  as it came from the factory a very sweet ride. My 
59 panel is called Grey cause thats it's color. my work truck a 63 single cab 
that I have had for 24 years is called the Grasshopper,cause with the gates 
down and being green it looks like a big grasshopper. My 88 vanagon is the 
Dog limo, it always is carrying my dogs. my 86 synco is called just that the 
synco, I use it for towing and winter driving. of course all 3 of my bugs 
have nicknames also. Haven't named the 3 project buses that I'm doing   a 62  
23 window, a 67 panel, and a 61 single cab. I'll name them when they get on 
the road.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
