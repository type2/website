Subject: FS: 82 Vanagon, Kansas City

Hi Airheads,

A co-worker informed me of an older gentleman who needs to sell his 82
Vanagon.  It has about 83,000 miles and an automatic transmission.  He
says it ran great, but then become sluggish.  It has been diagnosed as
having injector problems and is not currently running.

After inquiring about the price, he said he was thinking around $1,000,
but it sounds like he'd take a lot less.  I anyone is interested, let me
know and I can do more legwork.  He says the body is great.
