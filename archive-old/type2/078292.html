Subject: Re: [T2] '71 westy interior question

Hi - 

My 71 Westy (non-poptop) has a countertop that folds
over the sink when not in use. According to the
owner's manual, this is as it came from the factory.
When the countertop is unfolded, it is completely flat
in relation to the sink. There is a length of aluminum
angle that keeps the hings from overextending and
creating a tilted condition.

Hope this helps.
Tom

PS Isn't there a link to a westy manual online somewhere?
