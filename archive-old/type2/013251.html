Subject: [T2]Coil Short Again?

Hi All,

I have searched the archives but can't find my answer there. Here's my problem:

I just had a rebuild 2000cc with fuel injection installed (professionally).  Three days after that the coil shorted out. Had it replaced (a Bosh).  Now I'm getting the same symptoms all over again. It's misfiring especially after getting warm. What would cause the coil to short out on this set-up?  I don't have an om meter, so if there's away to check wires for shorts what would that be? (my tounge? Just kinding. I already have curry hair!)

This problem does sound like a short. I'm just wondering if there's a definate cause or if there could be multiple causes.  Hint: I didn't have this problem BEFORE the 2000cc was installed. 

Thanks,

Rae
