Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

You have to replace the flywheel and clutch assembly.
A 210 is very common. The 215 is scarce and the bolts suck! Bothe the 210 and
228 use 13mm headed 8mm bolts. The 215 uses 8mm triple-square headed 7mm
bolts.
If you change to the later bellhousing, you will have that 1/2&quot; problem that
you need on the starter except it adds it also to the back end of the engine
at the support bar mounts.....



&gt; Well I removed the starter and the engine won't budge at all!!! I can't turn
&gt; it, even on the fan hub bolt. I didn't think to turn the engine at all,
&gt; before I installed it.
&gt;
&gt; We had to wrestle it a little bit at first, thinking that the splines
&gt; weren't lined up. It wouldn't go the last inch or so, but after jacking the
&gt; engine up a bit it slid in.
&gt;
&gt; Would the larger flywheel keep the engine from moving at all? Buying another
&gt; starter isn't going to fix this is it? Because the engine should turn freely
&gt; with the starter removed right?
&gt;
&gt; I guess I have no choice but to drop the new engine. Shouldn't the guy who
&gt; recommended the 228 mm have told me I would have issues here? I actually
&gt; asked for the 215mm and he told me I should use the 228.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all the help so far.
&gt;
&gt; I am gonna have a beer and cry now.
