Subject: Re: [T2] How much material for Westy curtains?

&gt;My sister sewed up my curtains for me 6 years ago.
&gt;Instead of doubling or tripling the fabric, she bought
&gt;an equal amount of heavy duty white curtain backing. I
&gt;like to believe it adds a smidgen of insulation :-)

I've got curtains with backing on my house, but I don't know if I'd do it on 
a bus. You either have the white facing out or in, and either way I don't 
really like it... I'd rather have my nifty pattern facing out so my bus 
looks nicer, but also in so it looks nicer while I'm in it.
