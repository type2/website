Subject: Aftermarket sunroof

Hello,
I want a sunroof in my '74 bus and I am thinking of installing an after market
unit. The archives seem to indicate that this can be done.
My questions:
Any recommendations re manufactures?
Any recommendations re type (i.e. sliding ragtag, or other)?

Or, as I have a lot of work to do to restore this vehicle, should I look for
something like a Splittie with a factory sunroof, and give the '74 to one of my
kids?

Any thoughts from those who have gone before me will be cherished.
(I live in Chicago, so weather is a consideration.)

Thank you for your help,
Bob
