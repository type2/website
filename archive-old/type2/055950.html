Hey, I think you have problems.  I ran into some good wind and storms and hail
on my way back from Circle yer Wagons, but I never once felt like I would
loose control of the bus, or even though the wind was that bad.  You may have
hit worse than me though.

Get good reinforced tires.  Mine are 8 ply rated.  Get good shocks.  KYBs are
great, and have your front end checked.  The tie rods, ball joints and drag
link.  Also check your steering play.  The procedure for this adjustment is in
Bentley.

No you just don't have to live with it.  Come by on a windy day and I'll let
you drive my '74 as comparison.
