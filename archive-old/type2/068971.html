Subject: '71 Rescue

  Adjust the Statz, Uncle Joel.  I have officially bought Joe Fournier's
bus.  A nice '71 Westy which may have been the European model because it
has some subtle differences from the usual '71.  Some of the wiring is
a little different, and instead of the fold over cot up top it has a board
up there that slides back and forth and is held in place by some brackets.
 One really nice plus is the GAS HEATER !! :)  I had my eye on that thing
from day one.  I thought it had gotten away from me when, since I didn't
need another bus, I turned a friend onto it.  Well, he jumped on it like
it was about to get away from him.  It wouldn't have been long, because
Joe had put months of work into it.  Still a little rough, but well on
its way to recovery.  I immediately offered him $200 for the heater. ;)
Now would that be called underhanded, or just plain evil? :)  This list
taught me everything I know!  ;)
 Friend paid for 2/3 of the van, fiddled with it for a month or so,
found it has a couple of little problems like a vacuum leak and a loose
linkage, but never really got it road worthy.  Before I even got the
heater out of it he decided to bail on the resto. :( He asked me if I
wanted to buy it since I already had $200 in it =8)  About then everything
got kinda hazy, and my mind went reeling off into VW nirvana.  Next thing
you know I'm making payments to Joe! :)  Man, I have really got it bad....

  Drive on,
   Chris
