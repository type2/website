Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 oil drain plug

Having driven my Westy for eight years and disassembled about ten Type IV
engines I opted for the screen oil change since every 20 year old case
I've seen has oversized drain plugs and I've never seen damage to the
strainer. Nine foot pounds sounds good, I'll have to try it.

&gt; I stopped changing my oil through the drain and have just used the 
&gt; oil screen cover plate as a drain devise. 
&gt; --Should be noted for newbies that you can't torque that oil screen 
&gt; nut over 9ftlbs without possible case damage. 
&gt; This freaks me out so I do the opposite. Never touch the screen 
&gt; anymore.
