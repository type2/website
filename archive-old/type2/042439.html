Subject: the factory jack? or am I missing something?

ok, so is there supposed to be more than one piece?

If there is, I just dont get it. I mean, I understand how it (could) work, 
but the piece that moves up along the inside of the jack doesnt have 
anything to keep it extended out and under the bus rather than falling limp 
into the jack again.

rrrr, its not been a fun friday.

then again, I finally found the replacement cabinets ive been looking for.

yay!
