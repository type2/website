Subject: Re: [T2] Generator FS


&gt;I'm just guessing from memory, but aren't the 12 VDC generators the
&gt;same except for amperage capacity and length.
&gt;The length can be accommodated by just using a different mounting
&gt;plate, as I recall !?
&gt;Can somebody comment?

Yes, GR17X is for the 69-71 bus and is longer. it takes the concave backing
plate
to properly install it so that the fan belt runs in the correct plane with
the
crank pulley. The GR15X is one that mostly comes off beetle motors and
takes a
convex backing plate to push it out toward the rear a bit more and keep the
fan
belt in the right spot. When switching generators, also switch the
appropriate
backing plate or else your belt will brake pretty often and you'll have a
bad trip.
