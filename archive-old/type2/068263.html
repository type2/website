&gt;If the vehicle from the junk yard was non-operational, it was likely sold
&gt;that way (as a certified &quot;non-operational&quot; vehicle). Thus the seller is
&gt;not respponsible for smog. My discussion tended toward the driveable cars.

        At this point I can't guarrantee it was not a non op, but I'm
pretty sure it wasn't. The main part of the paperwork was the legal garbage
about the former owner abandoning it, the right of the impound yard to sell
it, etc. But I don't remeber seeing a non op cert. Whatever, it certainly
wasn't driveable when I bought it, as they'd thrown the rod through #3.
Since I had a rusty old &quot;flintstones&quot; ghia with a strong engine, this bus
made perfect sense...


&gt;I agree with you 110% on this one. It has got to be better in
&gt;terms of mimimal pollution, energy  and water useage, etc. for me to
&gt;keep one vehicle on the road for 20-30 years, than for me to buy a new car
&gt;every 4-5 years. Go figure!

        The only reasons I can see for new cars is to keep up with the
Joneses, or to be completely irresponsible about the maintanance of the
vehicle and destroy it. I wish those people would pay just a little
attention to thier cars, and give *me* some of that money they throw
away... I could use it for new rubber seals on my bus!!   ;-)

Peace,
