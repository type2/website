I don't wish to sling stuff at Steven, but the point of the previous
poster's inquiry was the distinction between coatings and converters,
and Steven's assertion, rather than clarifying, further muddies the
waters.

To quote Restomotive Laboratories (producers and purveyors of POR-15):

&quot;POR-15 is a rust-preventive paint designed for application directly on
rusted or seasoned metal surfaces. It dries to a rock-hard, non-porous
finish that won^Òt chip, crack, or peel, and it prevents rust from
re-occurring by protecting metal from further exposure to moisture&quot;

There is more discussion, and comparisons to rust converters at their
URL: http://www.por15_dot_com/por15faq.html#descrip

They go on to state that &quot;Rust conversion products claim to change the
chemical nature of rust and convert it to a more stable element that
won^Òt rust again. History of the failure of these products is well
documented.&quot;  Given that statement, I think they'd take strong exception
to having POR-15 called a &quot;rust converter product&quot;.
