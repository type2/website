Subject: steering wheel wanted!!
Message-ID: &lt;7jphdp$beng_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I am getting a 69' westy in really good shape. But the PO put a Grant sporty steering wheel on and i really don't like steering the bus with this little steering wheel. So my question is does anyone have a steering wheel in good shape they want to get rid of? If so please let me know. Thanks

Dan
