&gt;AVP had sent me a sump plate with sensor from a 914. I goto 
&gt;install the sump plate and quickly realize that the oil dipstick is 
&gt;in the way. after thinking about it awhile i went ahead and 
&gt;installed the 914 plate. finished the oil change (and new filter).

Just cut off the very bottom of your dipstick (estimate how much by how much
of it sticks out the top of the tube).  If you're cautious, cut off less
than you think you should, measure again, and cut off some more.  After
cutting it to the right length, it's still plenty long to reach into the oil
(unless you run your engine with less than 2 quarts in it).
