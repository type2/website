Subject: RE: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

&gt;    Not to worry...Chery cars are coming... ;-)


Not anymore. GM won a lawsuit prohibiting Chery from using their name in the
U.S.. So Malcolm Bricklin will have to pick another name for his Chinese
Yugo.  This is actually Bricklin's second attempt to follow up his Yugo
&quot;success&quot; by bringing us a new cheap car with a &quot;familiar&quot; name. A few years
ago he announced plans to reintroduce Yugo to the U.S. market under the name
ZMW.  Not surprisingly, BMW was not amused. (That car was supposed to be
here by late 2003 and it never happened, so we'll have to see if he fares
any better with his plans for the Chery. Maybe he can rename it Fiord, or
perhaps Vulvo.:-)
