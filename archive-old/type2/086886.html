&gt; Ok everybody,  I get a handle on one problem and
&gt; shucks, soon as I figure what I have to do, a new one
&gt; starts up.

yeah they always find something else to keep us busy

take off the valve covers look along the tops of the valves.
they should all be at about the same height.

a hyd valve could also be sticking, hyd valves can be replaced without
taking anything apart..

check your compression also

&gt; New problem,  I had a sudden brand new, loud valve
&gt; tick.  This was literally all of a sudden, driving
&gt; down the road.  I stopped as soon as I could, and with
&gt; all the leaks I had, I was about 3/4 quart down of
&gt; oil, but I never had low pressure.  Anyways, I top it
&gt; off, and let it warm up, and the valve ticking does
&gt; not go away; in fact, there seems to be a loss of
&gt; power at higher rpms.  There seems to be an
&gt; intermittent backfire, and that happens when trying to
&gt; give it gas.  If I let up, then it will go down the
&gt; road, tick and all.
&gt; 
&gt; All these problems keep stacking up as I address
&gt; others!!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, has there been a valve seat become detached
&gt; (dropped) all of a sudden?  Am I in for a rebuild?
&gt; 
&gt; Any and all help can be appreciated.  I am sorry for
&gt; monopolizing the list with my problems every week or
&gt; so.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and Kindest Regards,
