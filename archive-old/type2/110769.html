Subject: Re: [T2] anyone on fan wiring?  no answers?

wished i could help you but i took my fan and all out i will find me another source of heat.
as far as wirieing.
there is a wireing diagram in the haynes or bentley manual and honestly when it comes to wirieng it must be done right.
I will work on the bus drop the engine out and all bt when it comes to wireing that is a touchy subject i am guessing,for this ole dog anyways.
