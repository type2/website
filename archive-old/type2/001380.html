I have to say, I was fed up of tax discussions But today my bus ownership
got cheaper &amp; one hell of a lot easier to park.

My wife has M.e. &amp; is unable to walk more than 100 yards, now being pregnant
this is a big problem. We pay our local super-market to deliver our
shopping, but when we go out I have to drop her off &amp; find a parking place.
Since Mr whipy's a high-top, he's never seen the inside of a car park, so
it's normally 10 mins back!

We asked our local authority for a disabled parking permit, they said we
could only have one if my wife received disability benefit Normally you'd
have better chances of getting Bill Clinton re-elected &amp; win a Nobel Peace
Prize! We said that although not rich, we just wanted permit - No dice, No
disability benefit no badge. We applied, she was assessed by a Doctor &amp;
passed as disabled!

We now get the permit - cool :)

We now get £50 per week! COOL! ;)

We don't have to pay for road tax (£170 per year) COOOOL!! ;-)

The government will give us another £200 per month toward ANY vehicle (Even
a brand new BUS!)

PINCH ME NOW, IT MUST BE F'ING CHRISTMAS!!! d8&gt;)

All to the Pub, drinks on me!
