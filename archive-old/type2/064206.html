Folks,
I pulled all the wiring out of the dash (through the ashtray) and I found
about six connections connected with masking tape!  The paper tape
and disintegrated until it was powdery.  Thought that might be the
problem so I wrapped everything up with electrical tape and tried the
fuse again (all this is before we headed to church!  We were late!)
but still there was a problem.  I disconnected the fan.  Still no luck.

Finally I pulled out the cigarette lighter and disconnected it since it 
wasn't working anyway.  Viola!  No more problem!  I still want to get
the OHM meter and learn to trace down any other electrical problem
that arises.  I am just thankful that it wasn't the brake circuitry that was
at fault here.

Thanks to all of you for your help with this &quot;delicate&quot; problem...
