Subject: Re: [T2] Injection problems - maybe the fuel pressure?

Hi Jack,

Troubleshooting FI properly means going by the manual. If you don't 
already have one, get a bentley manual ASAP. You can also find the 
bosch Pro-Training manual here:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/~greg_potts/Bosch_L-Jetronic_FI_Manual/

I could ask a whole bunch of questions:

Have you adjusted the valves since re-assembly? Is there 12V at the 
coil? Do you have spark at the coil? Spark at the plugs? Are the plugs 
wet or dry?  Pull an injector and crank the engine to see what the 
spray pattern looks like. Loosen a connection at the cold start valve 
and confirm that you have gas flow.

But before you answer those go to Richard Atwell's most excellent 
vacuum diagram web page and confirm that ALL of your vacuum hoses are 
properly routed. If you have a vacuum line off the engine will crank 
forever without lighting up. AMHIK. (Collie told me)

&gt; Dear all,

&gt; I (my 16 yr old son, actually) bought a 1977 Westy recently. It wasn't 
&gt; running when we got it. We rebuilt the engine. It's in the bus now, 
&gt; but doesn't start. It cranks like mad, there's voltage in all the 
&gt; right places, and a VOM on the injector resistors shows a needle at 
&gt; 12V when not cranking, and bouncing around when cranking. From this I 
&gt; infer that the computer is turning the injectors on. And our spare 
&gt; computer does exactly the same thing.
