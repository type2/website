Subject: Re: Pops out of 4th - continued

My suspicions are all but confirmed.  Its a faulty rebuild.

The good news is, the rebuilder will make good on it - including the 
R&amp;R, which I suffered through last weekend.

Thanks to all who provided suggestions , recommendations, condolences.  
I think perhaps Don Tuleja hit the nail on the head when he said:

&quot;http://www.longenterprises_dot_com/remachined_sliders.htm

Maybe?&quot;

I've forwarded this info to my rebuilder, plus info on the evils of GL5.
