Subject: MegaSquirt on the type4

Hey Edward,
I think this is a great project and yes, I understand that it's a total
DIY project, which is fun in my book :)

I have a question, though, on how you plan to integrate the unit into
your bus.

The unit uses manifold pressure to detect the air flow into the engine,
correct?  So, for that reason it would replace the AFM.  Do you plan on
removing the whole AFM assembly and running the S-Tube directly to the
air filter.  I know there has been discussion before about the fact that
the AFM itself blocks a significant amount of airflow into the engine
and I wonder if this would increase power (ever so slightly) and/or
cause any problems (overheating?).  I guess the extra airflow would be
accounted for anyways.

Next, I noticed on the megasquirt site that there is the throttle
positioning sensor.  Are you going to use one of these, or are you only
going to use the manifold pressure?  I don't know much about manifold
pressure systems so I'm kinda curious how that all works out...

Thanks,
Mike
