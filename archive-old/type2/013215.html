&gt; My Question is;  Could my problem be valve related??Could the valves cause the engine not to start?? The engine sounds ok.  No odd noises, grinding or loud pops.  I'm not sure what I should try next.   Does anyone have any idea how to fix this problem????  Please help!!  Thanks Mike.
I would not suspect the valves. If you have good (decent) compression in
all 4 cyls then at least the valves are closing before the compression
stroke, I would assume another problem.
