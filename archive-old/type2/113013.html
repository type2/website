Subject: re:[T2] How do I replace my ignition lock?? Heh.

A few years ago i bought a 79 bus that was a recovered theft 
vehicle.  the steering lock and ignition was busted so it had to be 
replaced.  i only had the haynes manual.  it was not really hard to 
do.  i forget the whole procedure, but it just took some time and 
thinking.  taking off the horn cap was the probably the most difficult 
part. :)
My only advice is relax, grab a beer and start tinkering.
