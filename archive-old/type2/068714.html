&gt; The reason that the fan isn't working is that the motor has to be RUNNING.
&gt; It runs off the alternator, and if the alternator isn't spinning that
&gt; neither will the fan.  Start the motor, then go back and look at the fan.
&gt; it should work then.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, most heat will be pushed by the cooling fan on the back of the motor,
&gt; the little electric fan is pretty worthless, as far as I can tell.  I
&gt; never use mine.

Craig,
I don't think so.  On my old '78 it would run anytime the key was on and
the right-side red lever was down.

Besides, if that was the case, we wouldn't be talking about it running
for a little while and then blowing fuses.
