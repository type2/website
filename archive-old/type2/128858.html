Subject: Re: [T2] mysterious oil leak

&gt;&gt; ....
&gt;&gt; while discussing something else, i mentioned to another listee that i
&gt;&gt; had dropped the motor THREE TIMES july 4 to fix an oil leak. to no
&gt;&gt; avail.  i thought i'd enliven everybody else's evening with another
&gt;&gt; tiresome and pointles saga of aluminum motor hell
&gt;
&gt; I suspect your main seal is leaking,
&gt;
&gt; Do not just put on a new main seal. You are just wasting your
&gt; time. You must inspect the seal portion of the flywheel that rubs
&gt; against the main seal. This surface must be perfectly smooth and
&gt; shinny.

I agree with everything Gary says but there is one addition step that I 
recommend you take.  When the engine is out, check for radial play in 
the main bearing (thrust bearing).  I also had my engine in and out 
three times and did, in fact, replace both the main-seal and the 
flywheel.  After pulling it out the third time, I realized that the 
radial crankshaft play was so excessive that it was impossible for any 
seal to hold back the flow of oil.  Obviously, the solution was a long 
block!  Ouch.
