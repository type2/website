Subject: Re: [T2] Maryland Metrics - useful link

Steve,

I hate to say it&lt;grin&gt; but you need to get out more&lt;double grin&gt;.

This is one of those deals where you need to be in a club and do a group
buy! 

I have found that my local &quot;ace&quot; hardware has lots of metric fasteners and
stainless as well.  When I need some fast I just go and check their
bins...they are yellow &quot;specialty fasteners&quot; bins.  Not cheap, but easy
and immediate.  This is from a guy that *used* to consider a slow Sunday
morning just wandering in the hardware store a real treat.  No time for
that these days though.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; (I'm bored, can you tell? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Just surfing a bit and again I came across the Maryland Metrics home page,
&gt; which had the torque specs I was looking for.  I thught I ought to post
&gt; their URL here, as they have a web page that is an *incredible* source of
&gt; data on all sorts of metric fasteners.  The only real drawback to the page
&gt; is that they are strictly a wholesale outfit :-(  If you want 100, 1,000,
&gt; or 10,000... they have you covered!  For 1-10, tho, you're out of luck :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Their home page is:
&gt; http://mdmetric_dot_com/
&gt; As an example, from our recent discussion on metric stainless fasteners,
&gt; see their page of nuts at:
&gt; http://mdmetric_dot_com/fastindx/chapterd.htm
&gt; Not only steel and stainless steel, but aluminum and nylon!  Even
&gt; WHITWORTH thread!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Within the stainless section, they have what are probably the ideal nuts
&gt; for exhaust work at $22.10/hundred for plain or $77.90/hundred for
&gt; self-locking!  Heaven knows what I would do with the other 92 nuts after I
&gt; was done tho :-)  See:
&gt; http://mdmetric_dot_com/fastindx/ud56_62.pdf
&gt; 
&gt; Then you can look up the proper tightening torque at:
&gt; http://mdmetric_dot_com/fastindx/t29u.pdf
&gt; 
&gt; What an amazing site! I have no connection to them, but wish I did!
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, I am gonna buy their metric 150mm +/-.01mm electronic caliper
&gt; micrometer for $32.  Just too good a deal to pass.
