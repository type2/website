        John Anderson,
        I think a lot of us (myself for one and maybe you)
expected the Bus Boy's Catalog to be a big production full
of interesting bits for VWs, similar to the RMMW, West Coast
Metric or Wolfsburg West productions. Ain't so. The BB catalog
is that 6-8-10 page photocopied on colored stock item that
came with your order. I thought it was the current specials flyer,
at first. If you got something that lists their safaris and
lowered spindles, you've got the catalog, cos you can bet
there are NO specials on those items.

        YES there is a lot of info there, Jim, if you're
listening, but its not the eye-candy of the old Bus Stop RMMW 
catalog, or the WCM (which you did fer-gosh-sakes).

        Type IV owners, a fun extra reference catalog for the
last of the aircooled flat fours is the Automobile Atlanta
catalog for 914s. 

        Bill
