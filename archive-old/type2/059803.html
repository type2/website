Hi folks,

Dan posted about breaking his accelorator cable while fitting his new engine
(sounds like he's as pleased with his as I am with mine) so here's a how to
fix it tip they may be of use to someone.

It assumes that the cable breaks at an accesable point.

First backoff the adjuster to get an overlap at the break, then feret around
the bottom of your tool box or odds and ends tin (or even purchase at the
local hardware store!!!!) to find an nylon elecrical connector block. [these
are usualy sold in strips of about 10 each connector has a brass tube with a
small screw on each side of each connector, all covered with nylon].

Then push the two broken ends through the connector (loosen the screws first)
one from each side then tighten the screws to clamp the broken ends together.

Then take up the slack at the adjuster and you have a repair to get you home
when a replacement cable is not availlable.

On my old bus the cables were permently attached to the heat exchangers using
these connectors and being brass they don't rust so come undone. 

Good luck
Bob
