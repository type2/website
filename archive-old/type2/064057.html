Subject: Re: When to part out? '71

Jim, I think it's a very novel thing to take an old bus like this and 
salvage parts off from it.  It's kind of like organ donor transplants when 
&quot;some must die so that others may live.&quot;  It does bother me to junk a 
vehicle, 'specially a VW, but when a vehicle has been let go so long that 
it's not worth the time and moneyto fix it up, it's not really your fault.  
You're doing the merciful thing.  

Does the fact that I want that engine if the compression is good, have any 
bearing on the afore written paragraph.  Nah......

:-)
