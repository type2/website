Subject: spam

They get your email address lots of ways.

I read an interesting article about it several months ago, but can't
remember were.

1 The majority of spam is from usenet group postings.
2 It can be read in your web browser - if you use Windows / Outlook.  Java
applets can grab it.
3 If you have any personal web pages with your email address on them.
4 Brute force blasting of random generated names to known domains.  They
track what's bounced as non-valid.
5 If you've ever purchased anything off the web, even though the vendor
&quot;promises&quot; not to spam you, they most likely sell your name and e-mail
address to spammers.  These are very valuable because now you're known as a
valid E-mail AND a buyer.
6 Some newsletters also sell names / address to spammers.  :`(

I'm an IT guy in the industry for +15 years.  I get 100-200 spams per day.
Heaven forbid should I take a week off.
The only way to stop spam is to lobby your local representatives to pass
anti-spam legislation with HEAVY penalties.
