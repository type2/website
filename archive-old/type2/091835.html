Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker by Hella

[...]
Dont know how to tell but hella and bosch both were OEM parts suppliers 
for electrical stuff from about 74 on to current production of VW.  The 
only way i have been able  to tell on some of it is that the second part 
number on the item is not a bosch type number.

&gt; Folks,

&gt; I bought an expensive side marker housing recently and the vendor claims
&gt; it's a Hella part.  The picture on their website is marked Hella but 
&gt; what I
&gt; received doesn't have any markings at all.
&gt;
&gt; How can I tell if this is a Hella item these days?
