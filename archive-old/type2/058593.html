Subject: Oil Leaks, Pushrod Tube Seals
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm in a long process of finding and fixing numerous oil leaks in my '72
camper, 1700 engine.  The oil is getting into the right heat exchanger, thus
smoking everywhere.  Also a lot of oil is on the tin below the cylinders.

The first step was checking the rear main oil bearing seal.  This was the
suggestion from a VW mechanic.  I had removed the fan and cleaned the
crankcase, inside the fan housing, and the fan.  Found about 1/4 inches of
&quot;gunk&quot; in the fan housing.  After the cleaning and reassemble, I drove the
bus for about 45 minutes.  The rear bearing, oil pump, and relief valve plug
were clear of oil.  I also was able to view the oil cooler and did not
notice any oil dripping from there.  There was still oil dripping from the
pushrod tubes and maybe from the valve cover.

Now I'm ready to replace the pushrod tube seals and valve cover seal.  The
Bentley book states that the heads do not have to be removed to replace the
seals.  Has anyone done this before?  How is the tubes removed?  Are they
pulled through the head?   I would appreciate any words-of-wisdom.  Thanks.

Dave
