I have a '77 sunroof van to part out before it heads to the graveyard.  The
engine bay is empty and the body is pretty rusty, but the other parts of
interest are;

Late Westy poptop (no cot)
functional tranny (I drove it home)
Good brake drums  (bad rotors)
Spare tire mount
WIndows (no sliders or jalousies)
Some westy interior parts
Whatever else you can think of

Make offer or trade.  Lemme know what you need.
I'm midway between Portland and Seattle.
