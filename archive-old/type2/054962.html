Subject: sump sending unit

I thought I might weigh in on this thread.  I have yet to install the 
sump sender I bought.  So I looked at it again and to me the sensor part
doesn't touch the case at all.  The VDO directions say to drill a 9/16&quot;
hole in the sump,  the sensor portion is 1/4&quot; wide and at least 3/8&quot; to
1/2&quot; above the sump plate.  The sensor is secured by a nut threaded from the inside(top) and not from tapping and threading directly to the sump.
I'll see if my gauge is accurate by throwing the sensor in some boiling
waterand if it's on, great!  If not, I'll return it and get another as
I wouldn't know how to calibrate it.  I'm with David on this.  I think 
the sump sender is a fine location.     Maybe I'll get a CHT gauge.....
just in case ;)
