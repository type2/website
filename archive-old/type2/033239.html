This much, at least, is not that bad.  Your endplay will change with each
flywheel you install, so that even if they DID set it at the shop, then
remove the flywheel, and ship (it does not come with a flywheel..), your
old flywheel may very well cause it to be either to loose or too tight.

&gt; I do realize that they have to deal with heads from almost 30 years ago, so 
&gt; they are working with the best they can, but still if the customer can see 
&gt; the head is cracked why can't AVP?!?!

I'm just glad they anteed up and fixed them. (it was the same head, btw,
not two...i'm not sure where the second crack came from...but you can be
assured i was not happy!)  They offered to pay to have them welded
locally, also, but i was unable to find someone who felt that he could do
it (to tight of a space to work in with their gun...)

later...david
