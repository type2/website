Subject: Factory sticker estimaged mileage?

Hi,

Anyone know of a source to find the estimated mpg city/highway that
was listed on the sticker in the dealership on buses?

Specifically, I'm interested in my '80 Vanagon, 2.0L, fi w/air (no
removed), non-California.

I'd just like to know how things compare today to when it was new.


Sincerely,
--
