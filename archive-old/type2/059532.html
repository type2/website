&gt; I have often thought about upgrading my 71's front disks to 73+. As I

bunch
&gt; better braking system.

Better, but not spectacularly better!  The main reason to go with this
conversion is to get longer brake pad life (if you can find the
thicker pads!) and to avoid replacing the scarce '71-'72 calipers. 
The rotors are pretty much the same, but different offset.  The
calipers are physically larger, but have the same bolt spacing and pad
shape.  Don't think you can mix and match these components, though. 
I've looked long and hard at the early and late parts and came to the
conclusion that the only way to go is a complete swap.

&gt; The front brakes provide a large majority of the
&gt; braking force - weight transfer, etc.. The last car that I did rear
&gt; disks for had pretty small pads when compared to the front. I would
&gt; think that increasing the braking power up front would be more
&gt; beneficial than rear disks.

Quite true.  If the drums will lock the rear wheels (and they will if
in good condition) then there is no need to go to disks.  The only
advantage to disks is increased fade resistance on long downhills, but
if you are fading your brakes you are going too fast for a bus anyway!
