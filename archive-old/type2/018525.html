Well, when it rains it pours.....The engine rebuild has suffered yet
another setback, the list of which is reaching monumental proportions.

Background:
New Case (full flow)
New Crank (stock, but balanced)
A LOT of endplay(?)
1 Dumb$ss who thinks he knows something about VW engines

Problem:
I buttoned up the case and tried to intall the oil pump...Doesn't
fit......DUH.....it's a 3 rivet cam (flat cam gear).....
Upon the advice of my local VW shop (who knows a lot..selectively), I
started the search for a good used German cam.  [I've been reading about
the hardness problems with the new brazilian cams.  How real is this?]
I tried using calipers to determine lift, per Mike West.  The numbers
were all off by exactly.010&quot;.  This seemed odd. On a whim, I checked the
lift with a dial indicator and an old case.  Turned out to be in spec.
BUT....
When I tried the walk-out test (rotate the crankshaft backwards) the cam
pulled out of the bearings.  Only then did I notice the -1 stamped on
the inside cam gear face.  So, I put the 3 rivet cam (no mark on the
inside face...assuming it is a 0) back in and repeated the test.  It
also walked out.(Guess it's good I put in the wrong cam;).  I checked
the idiot book, Wilson, Bentley, and Hoover and cannot find how to
determine the proper camshaft gear pitch.

So, once again I apeal to the collective wisdom of the Jedi Council.
Question #1.
How do I determine the proper camshaft gear pitch?

Question #2.
Is there any truth to the stories of the new camshafts of questionable
origin going flat?  If so, where can I get a suitable STOCK cam?

TIA
