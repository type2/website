Subject: carb re-jetting

  So I have decided to keep my single carb, and not opt for the duals.  I 
need suspension, and brake work, so I will spend the money on that instead.  
My issue is this,  I have a 1971 DP motor stretch stud case.  This is a 
Boston Engine with just a little over 2k.  I have a non-stock, Empi air 
cleaner, which seems a little less restrictive than the stock.  I know you 
will cringe when I say this, but I am running an 009.
  Have been having a little trouble finding a stock vacuum advance.  My 
stock muffler is junk, and I found a nice extractor system, with dual quiet 
packs (has beetle exhaust right now)  yuk!  Myt question is this:  With the 
addition of the new exhaust, and a non-stock air cleaner, not to mention the 
009, will I need to re-jet my carb?  I believe the main jets are 127.5. 
Could these additions make me run too lean?
   BG
P.S.  Anyone know where I can find the stock dizzy? ;)
