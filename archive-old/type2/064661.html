SUBJECT: VW 1967

The '67 bug is (or was) the most desireable year, but the
reasons may not apply any more. The main reason was that it
was the first year with 12V electrics and the last year
where the engine was made in Germany.  Starting in 1968, the
engines were made in Mexico. 1968, 69 &amp; 70 motors tended to
pull the cylinder studs out of the aluminum engine cases
because of poor casting quality. The cure was to put steel
helicoil inserts into the engine cases.  I would assume that
most existing bug motors have had this done by now.
    The 1967 was also the last year with the swing axle
transaxle. (I think this was considered a negative, but I
don't remember).
I would definitely replace the clutch release bearing while
the engine is out. (In fact I would be tempted to replace
the clutch disk &amp; pressure plate too since the motor will be
already out.
I have owned at least one bug of every year from 1966 to
1975 (including the awful 1968 AutoStick), and I would have
to say that it is a good thing that the VW bug is dead. With
the benefit of experience with more modern cars, I can say
that the aircooled VWs were junk, garbage, trash, useless,
etc. In the '60s they may have been OK, but by the '70s they
were hopelessly outdated.
