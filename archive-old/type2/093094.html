Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

The Bentley schematic will show which fuse terminal each wire goes to on 
the fuse panel.

I think the fuses are labelled S1 through S-something. Also at the bottom 
of the page the fuse panel is pictured showing visually which fuse handles 
a particular circuit.

The schematic I have is a copy of the one from Vintage Bus.

&gt;Was  assisting on a wiring call  and during troubleshooting  realized 
&gt;that  i was looking at a  73 fuse panel and wiring patched into a 72 
&gt;bus.  PO had also left a lot of wires hanging.  What i need is a chart 
&gt;that shows me the terminal designations on the back side of the fuse 
&gt;panel. In all of my tons of info here i cant locate a  simple picture to 
&gt;show what terminal is what.  I can see no terminal designations marked on 
&gt;the panel.  The fuse panel appeared to be relatively new and is probably 
&gt;a  replacement fuse panel.
