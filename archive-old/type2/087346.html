Subject: Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)

I have struggled w=2F overheating on my bus=2C and thought I should post af=
ter reading recent posts on the subject=2E  I don't claim to be an expert a=
nd only offer my experience which is limited to 1600 upright motors=2E  I a=
chieved improvements=2C but am still working on the problem--so take this F=
WIW=2E  My opinion is that every detail matters and must be verified b=2Ff =
you solve an overheating problem=2E  Vacuum leaks=2E  Missing Hoover bit=3F=
  Correct carb w=2F correct jets=2E  correct timing=2Fdistributor=2E  Corre=

lity heater boxes =26 muffler=2E  It goes on=2E=2E=2E

From my experience=2C a few points worth emphasizing=3A

1=29=09replacement carbs are not jetted correctly =28too lean=29 for a bus=2E=
  Verify the jetting and try to match stock jets =28see specs in Bentley=29=
=2E  The air correction =28AC=29 jet is very important here--bigger AC jet =
means leaner mixture=2E  I am still trying to find a stock AC jet for a 71 =
bus--which is what you need for a 1600dp in a bay window=2E

2=29=09Fan speed=3A  hand turn your gen=2Falt pulley w=2F a wrench and coun=
t the number of revolutions to the gen=2Falt pulley for one revolution of y=
our crank shaft pulley=2E  Accd to VeeWee111=2C the stock ratio is 1 turn o=
f crank pulley to 2=2E0 turns of the gen=2Falt pulley on a 1600dp=2E  1=3A2=
=2E1 is better=2E  From memory=2C the correct ratio is 1=3A1=2E9 on a 1600s=
p=2E  Any less and your fan speed is too low=2E  There at lots of potential=
 reasons and VeeWee111 has a lot to say about this=2E  One big factor is th=
e size of the crank pulley--VW made different sizes for different motors bu=
t didn't mark the size on the pulley=2E  Larger crank pulley =3D faster fan=
=2E  Also--do you have the correct fan=3F  VW made many different fans=2E  =
VeeWee111 has posted often about this=2E

3=29=09Degreed pulleys are nice as a concept=2C but I was unable to find on=
e worth having=2E  Two issues=3A 1=29 weight=3A Accd to the Gene Berg catal=

 are =22power pulleys=22 which means smaller diameter which means slower fa=
n speed =28good for drag racing=29=2E  Gene Berg's degreed pulley is actual=
ly heavier than stock =28good for daily driver=29 and =22stock=22 size for =
an older sp motor=2E  Nonetheless=2C it is too small for a 1600 in a bus=2E=
  See my  post on this at=3A

Best option that I found was to verify the TDC mark on a stock pulley and a=
dd my own degree marks=2E  There are various ways to do this=2E

4=29=09To set max advanced on a distributor w=2F =2Aboth=2A mechanical and =
vacuum advance =28e=2Eg=2E stock dist=2E for 1600dp=29=2C disconnect the va=
cuum advance =28and retard if present=29=2C set the timing w=2F a timing li=
ght so that you have the desired max advance =28e=2Eg=2E 30 deg=2E BTDC at =
3000 RPM=29=2C then re connect the vacuum advance=2E  This works b=2Fc unde=
r load=2C the vacuum advance mechanism does not come into play above appx=2E=
 1=2F2 wide open throttle =28WOT=29=2E  Thus=2C at 3000 RPM under load=2C t=
he carb will be + 1=2F2 WOT and vacuum advance doesn't have much impact on =
timing=2E  In contrast=2C if you pull the throttle open by hand to increase=
 RPMs while the car is out of gear=2C the carb will be at less than 1=2F2 W=
OT=2C vacuum advance will come into play=2C and total advance at 3000 RPM w=
ill be higher=2E  On a vacuum advance =2Aonly=2A distributor =28e=2Eg=2E st=
ock dist=2E for 1600sp=29=2C this does not apply=2E

My general advice=3A  If you have an overheating problem=2C return everythi=
ng to stock=2E  everything=2E  tweak it until the overheating problem is re=
solved=2E  =5BPersonally=2C I feel that oil temps over 225 in the sump are =
a problem=2E  Where you measure is an issue too=2E  Sump plate temp sensors=
 tend to measure case temp =28which is cooler=29 rather than oil temp=2E  I=
 personally noticed a huge difference in readings=2E  I like the VDO dipsti=
ck sensor=2E  You can do a quick=2Fdirty calibration in boiling water=2E  R=
emember=2C the oil in the heads is likely hotter than the oil in the sump=2E=
=5D  Returning everything to stock will be a lot of work=2E  No 009s=2C sto=

rheating problem=2C if you still have any energy and want improvements=2C c=
hange one thing at a time so you can evaluate the effect=2E  Mods that I li=
ke include Type IV oil cooler properly installed=2C full flow oil filter =28=
which I don't have=29=2C and alternator =28w=2F correct alternator belt =28=
different from gen belt=21=29 and backing plates=29  I can't claim to have =
always followed this advice=2C but any other approach always ends up being =
more time and =24=2E

All of this is much less important than the fact that your brakes are worki=
ng perfectly=2E  and you have new rubber fuel lines=2E  and your seat belts=
 are in good condition=2E

Hope this helps=2C
