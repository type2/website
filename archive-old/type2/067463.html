Subject: Re: Bus ancestry - the dymaxion car?

&gt;&gt;Buckminster Fuller's dymaxion car. This has become my automotive
&gt;&gt;obsession. Back in the early thirties, the guy who gave us the geodesic
&gt;&gt;dome designed a car that could carry eight adults, cruise at 140 mph,
&gt;&gt;and get 30 miles per gallon.

They also crash-tested the Dymaxion (not intentionally) which resulted
in the untimely death of the pilot/driver... Bucky was devastated and as
a consequence, shelved the project....

We have a (unrestored as yet!) teardrop shaped 1947 Scotty trailer
which the SO and I named &quot;Bucky&quot; in deference to our favorite visionary!

Long live the unshackled thinkers....
