Subject: Re: [T2] Installing master cylinder

This really isn't that big a deal.  I just did it in about 1/2 hour a few
weeks ago.  One of the wheel cylinders was crap and the resevoir was empty.
Replaced the WC and bled.  Always bleed from furthest point back in.  Should
be simple.

Good luck,
Bill

Subject: [T2] Installing master cylinder


&gt; I've replaced a leaky master cylinder on my '68.
&gt; Brand-new german part. Also replaced the hose to the
&gt; filler reservoir.
&gt; Next step is putting in the fluid, adjusting the
&gt; shoes, and bleeding. Argh.
&gt; (I've never had much luck fixing brakes and have gone
&gt; near insane bleeding brakes. I can only assume I
&gt; dented my karma in a previous life.)
&gt;
&gt; To add to my anxiety, i came across a problem in the
&gt; Type II archives I never anticipated. Something about
&gt; not being able to push fluid from the reservoir into
&gt; the new master cyl. Somebody went as far as filling
&gt; the master up BEFORE putting it in!
&gt;
&gt; Is the a common problem?! I do not want to take it out
&gt; again.
&gt;
&gt; I was hoping to:
&gt; 1. Fill the reservoir
&gt; 2. Pump 50-60 times.
&gt; 3. Keep the reservoir filled while i went through the
&gt; bleeding process.
&gt; 4. Go crazy with frustration. Give up and take it too
&gt; a brake place.
&gt; 5. Drive to national parks in Utah this weekend.
&gt;
&gt; Any help or warnings appreciated.
