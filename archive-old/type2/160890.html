Subject: Re: [T2] Repair shop on the way to Flodida

Here's a couple of VW shops for the Albany area:

Hackel's VW
1374 Central Ave
Albany, 	New York
Phone: 518.458.2897

Will Work On: AC &amp; WC

Hackel's pretty much out of the aircooled game now but he might have
engine parts if you need them in a pinch (he helped me out with some
cylinder head studs in the past). Last time I was there he had some
very beautiful looking rebuilt type-1 engines on display.

Terry LaCasse VW
902 Central Nassau Rd., Hoags Corners
East Nassau, 	New York 12062
Phone: 518.766.5654

Will Work On: VWs
Rt 66. -  Troy off Rt 20 in Nassau.   Left _at_ Hoags Corners Inn.

Everyone around Albany that owns a bus knows Terry because he's the #1
guy to go to. A little out of your way (about 30 minutes East of
Albany). He's got a few parts buses sitting around (currently buried
under about 2 feet of snow)


Hope that helps

peace

&gt; HI,
&gt;
&gt; We are a retired couple and In a few weeks we will be travelling from
Quebec
&gt; Canada to Tampa Florida in a 1975 westy . I was wondering if any one on the
&gt; list could refer me to some honest and competent repair shops along the way.
I
&gt; already know about the air list and I carry it with me at all time ( I am
also
&gt; on the air list) but my experience wit it was very frustrating du to the
&gt; amount of wrong phone number on it.
&gt;
&gt; We will be Taking I 87 from the Canadian border to Albany NY, I 88 to
&gt; Binghamton NY., I 81 to Pulaski Virginia, I 77 to Colombia Virginia, I 26 to
I
&gt; 95 all the way to Florida where we will be meeting with some friends that
are
&gt; very familiar with the rest of our trip.
