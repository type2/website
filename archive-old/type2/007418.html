&gt; I found a rebuilt box for my '68 bus ($250), but so far have wasted 2
&gt; afternoons with 2 different pullers trying to remove the pitman arm. 
&gt; The nut was not very tight -- came right off.  I had started applying
&gt; Liquid Wrench 2 weeks ago thinking this would help loosen things up, but
&gt; no dice!

Yeah, I can't see that helping.

&gt; I remember a post (can't remember whose) recommending a chevy puller. Is
&gt; this worth the purchase for a probable one-time use, or should I break
&gt; down and take the job to my local VW mechanic?  Or is there another
&gt; approach I should attempt?

If you are talking about regular adjustable pullers, like 2 or 3 arm, then those 
are the wrong ones.  You want a true pitman arm puller.  It's a chunk of steel 
shaped like a C with a bolt through the middle.  The ears of the C grip the arm 
and you tighten the bolt to pull it off the shaft.  There is no adjustment, though 
they might make different size pitman arm pullers for different shafts.  Around 
here, some parts chains loan these for free.  You pay for it up front, keep it as 
long as you want and then either keep it or bring it back.  If you bring it back, 
they put it back on the shelf behind the counter for the next person and give 
you your full price back.  That's what I did.  Also, if you tighten it &quot;real tight&quot; 
(judgement call) and still doesn't break free, leave the pitman arm puller in 
place and rap around the shaft with a hammer.  This, combined with the 
tension of the puller will break it free.  I've used the same technique (puller plus 
hammering) to get brake drums off, too.
