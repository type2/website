Subject: 69 DC project

Thanks for replies..

&gt; When you say &quot;frame&quot; what exactly do you mean? The bus doesnt really have
a
&gt; frame. It's basically a unibody construction

    Sorry, I was lazy with the typing, &quot;frame&quot; = &quot;subframe&quot;.

 &gt;Body work is not cheap to do right.

    Ya...  the price of the DC is right, but I think the cost and energy
involved in a floor/frame-up resto will be quite involving.

 &gt; How far gone is this DC?

(according to PO, I have not yet had the bounty of crawling among
stinging-nettle and thistles to look for myself): Will invlove replacement
of all subframe/floor components in rear half, not as involving in front.
The PO had plans to take the entire floor/subframe from another bus and go
from there. (I still would like to know if anyone has done this, and been
&quot;long-term happy&quot; with results).  Will also involve replacement of some
lower body metal, quarter panel type stuff. Upper body is straight, nicley
closing doors, bed is fairly straight, dropgates sraight but one hinge
rusty. All in all looks enticing until looking underneath.

 &gt; start with a better project unless you are a damn good welder.  That one
is for someone with more money than sense...

Ya, I've been eyeing this thing for more than a year, wondering if it would
be worth it to take the plunge. My definition of a project would involve
more sense than money too. I think I was starting to lean towards the voice
in my head that was saying &quot;just walk away from it, dammit&quot;.  I might just
take one more good look at it (in the nettles and thistles) and do a more
thorough probe underneath before I make up my mind.

If anyone has a say in what to look for where I would say a definite &quot;NO&quot; to
this project; input, need input!

Ben -- seeking any DC from pre-67 to Vanagon.
