&gt;Is it possible to test compression with the engine out of the bus ?

Yes.

&gt;I have been turning the engine via the nut on the generator pulley - is
&gt;this ok ?

No.  You will have to get a bellhousing or tranny, attach it to the engine,
mount a starter on the bellhousing, and crank the starter.  This is the
only way you will get the cranking speed that you need for the proper
readings.

I suppose you could get an idea of whether there is *some* or *no*
compression with the wrench-on-pulley method, but that's about all.

&gt;What psi should I be getting, and what tollerence is acceptable ?
&gt;I have a stock 1600 '76.

You should be getting 110-120 psi, and you should have no more than 15%
difference between the highest and lowest cylinder.
