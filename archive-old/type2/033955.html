Subject: EGR gaskets

Hello List,

I hope someone here who plays with EGR systems can tell me what to do about
EGR gaskets.  I have one gasket 071 131 599B, and have another one 021 131
599J backordered from busdepot.  I know four gaskets are required.  Does
anyone know where I can find them?

Thanks,
Christopher Darilek
