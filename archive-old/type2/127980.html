Subject: Altenator

I was puttin my altenator back togather and came
across a problem.  There is a black wire within the
harness that has been cut off by someone (not me). 
Where does it go?  I have the three wires that go to
the connector and the wire for the brushes.  Where's
the black one go?

Also, is there some shrink wrap or protecting shield
around the connection for the brushes?  Mine is bare.
