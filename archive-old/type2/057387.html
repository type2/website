I have decided to wait until the sun comes up, and call in sick. This way I
can get out the testers and meters and see what else could have gone wrong in
24 hours, without doing any thing but put the air filter back on. Thanks for
the quick response. The bus is a 79, with all the stock flotsam and jetsam
still in place. I'm sure I'll get tomorrow, but it really was pouring rain and
dark and desperate. Thanks again............Johnny.....and Rose ......and bus.
