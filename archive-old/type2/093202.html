Subject: Re: [T2] Engine types in a camper.


&gt;I'm just starting to look for a camper.  I really need something
&gt;with a big pop up, not like the smaller splitty pop ups I've seen.
&gt;I also want reliability and repairability.  I'm familiar with the
&gt;type I engines but not the type IV, I know even less about the
&gt;waterboxers in the Vanagons.  I like the Vanagon interiors better
&gt;I don't really like green or orange plaid!
&gt;The fact that they are newer isn't bad but the waterboxers scare me.  I
&gt;know the in '80-'83.5 they came with the IV.
&gt;So I guess what I'm looking for are experiences with each type of
&gt;engine in a camper.  Also, if I get a water cooled engine, which really
&gt;does seem wrong, am I out of luck getting help from AIRS?

You've got to narrow down your expectations a little.

If $$$ is primary then a Beetle powered bus is your bus. They are speed 
limited by small engines. They are the cheapest to repair, easiest to 
repair, and lowest powered. The '71 is the queen bee as it has disc brakes 
and a Beetle motor. These Beetle powered busses are '68-'71.

Next is the Type IV which is slightly more durable, and capable of running 
65 - 70 mph (faster you go the louder they get, mpg goes down). The 
interiors are more elaborate. I prefer the 1978 Westy. You get a slightly 
higher geared tranny and after '72 an access panel above the engine which 
is VERY nice. You could weld one into an older bus though if vintage stock 
isn't your goal. These are '72-'79.

1980 brought the Vanagon. It has a redesigned suspension, redesigned body, 
and the same drivetrain until mid-1984 (I think). Imagine a few hundred 
pounds more and the same drivetrain as the 2.0 powered Baywindows.

When the wasserboxers came along they brought fancy things like power 
windows, 4WD if you could afford it, and a/c. I suggest you drive each 
vehicle style, and read this list and the Vanagon list before you buy. Many 
of the wasserboxers suffer from head gasket problems due to design and the 
wrong coolant in the system that caused corrosion and thus failure of the 
head gasket. Fix it right and it will stay fixed. These VW's are the most 
expensive to repair but if you have access to junkyard beauties, it may not 
be too bad. The wasserboxer is a redesigned Beetle motor with a 
water-filled cooling system added to it. They came in 1.9 and 2.1 liter 
displacements.

Remember when you read these lists that you hear alot about people's 
problems and not as much about their successes - not as much posts about 
how their bus or Vanagon has gone for 7 months with no problem... Our VW's 
are not that bad.

I've driven also the Eurovan with very pleasant results. A plain passenger 
van runs about $5K for a decent one. That is power everything and a/c but 
no camper stuff.

My opinion is that a watercooled Vanagon is a refined 1978 Baywindow. Take 
a baywindow Westy and add sound proofing, get the heater to 100% with 
'72-'74 heater boxes, install Vanagon seats, 15&quot; wheels and tires, swaybars 
and love life. Still much, much cheaper than a car payment on a late model 
ChevFordoDimelerChryBaby that is instantly worth $5K less than it did 3 
seconds before you drove it off of the dealer's lot. I've done the car 
payment thing now for 3 years on my Honda (which we love) but never, ever 
again... Cash only baby!

I've taken things a step further with the impending addition of a Corvair 
110 HP engine and transaxle in a perpetual hunt for a more modern 
interstate pace... We'll see.
