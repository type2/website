Subject: Re: [T2] clutch cable again!

&gt;The bowden tube is the first thing it runs thru in the front (fif) of the
bus correct? Then the cable is exposed, then it enters that flexible tube
that has a special name in the bentley that I read yesterday and don't
remember. I assume damage to the bowden tube would mean crimped/cut in some
way, rubbing on the cable.

Bowden Tube is in the rear on the tranny. Its the flexible tube you are
referring to above. If it is not adjusted properly you will find the cable
binding and could affect your need to screw teh wind nut down all the
way...
