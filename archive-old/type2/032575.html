I don't know about the type 4 engine, but the 1600 crankshaft is easily 
damaged in rear end impacts.

In one such instance in my experience, the crank was very slightly bent and 
wasn't discovered until engine heating became a problem.  The engine was 
carefully inspected before the bus went to the body shop, and passed with 
flying colors.

When cool the engine ran and sounded fine, but when fully warmed up, 
especially when pulling a big load or grade, the crank would bind and the 
engine overheated very quickly.

And there was no apparent external damage to the engine - the crank pulley 
took the hit but didn't appear damaged even after disassembly and inspection.

If there's any possibility anything bumped that engine, I'd make very sure the 
insurance adjuster clearly comprehends the possibility of expensive engine 
repair or replacement.

&gt;&gt;  Also, before you assume your '73 engine is still good, you might want to 
test that theory. Rear ending can cause engine and tranny damage. It can cause 
the case to get hammered and become useless. It can also ram the input shaft 
into the tranny...either damaging the tranny or breaking the input shaft or 
the input shaft circlip, which can be replaced without TOO much fuss. It 
depends on how the impact occurred.  &lt;&lt;
