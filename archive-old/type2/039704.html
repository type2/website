&gt;Law or not, I am waiting for someone to give me a good reason why drinking

I suggest, doing neither is more rational than doing either.

&gt;&gt;  I happen to agree that eating, drinking, shaving, reading newspapers,
&gt;&gt;putting on makeup etc. are incompatible with UK driving conditions,
&gt;&gt;however that may not be the case in the US, VW have now adapted their
&gt;&gt;cars for that market and maybe Dr. Tim should acknowledge that.
&gt;
&gt;Again, I am not suggesting that any of these things either are or are not 
&gt;safe to do while driving.  I am trying to focus on the reasoning behind the 
&gt;the lack of cupholders and non-lack of ashtrays in busses and other German 
&gt;cars.  My personal opinion is that the Germans are very strict with their 
&gt;laws (which is a good thing) but that they made an exception for smoking 
&gt;while driving because they are simply too entrenched/addicted/whatever to 
&gt;give it up.  I see this as a serious failure in their standard methodology, 
&gt;akin to Jimmy Swaggart having extramarital affairs while preaching about 
&gt;the evils of illicit sexual relations to the rest of the world.

I agree. I wish they would not honor the irrational market demands of
yuppies based upon poor or lacking reason. I wish they hadn't, and damned
the US sales. If all the auto makers did so, the yuppyfied could be put in
line. That would make my DM maschines that much more rare. That agrees with
my sence of values.

The Neandereers should have gone on strike when marketing said, &quot;Make
wizbang or else!!&quot; They should have had the strenght of conviction to chose
else. &quot;To hell with your wizbang, or else!!&quot;
That they knuckled under and gave in just demonstrates they are as human as
any other ape, and knew not what they did.
