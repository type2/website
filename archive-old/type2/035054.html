Subject: $4000 is not enough (was major engine problems)

&gt;I don't have a lot of money to sink into this thing.  I've already spent
&gt;over $4,000 and it still doesn't run. 

My drum beat this month: $4000 is not enough (I assume that includes 
purchase price).

Anyone who gets a well-running bus for under $5000 is flat-out lucky, or 
a shrewd and merciless negotiator. The minimum you can expect to spend to 
have a daily-driveable, reliable bus is $5000. And that's the minimum. A 
truly reliable vehicle -- one that's all but guaranteed not to break down 
-- should cost you close to $10000 (again, that's Doktor Tim's figure and 
I think he's right).

So at $4000, you're a grand short of the minimum.

But this is a gross generalization, and should be taken as such. Throwing 
money at a bus doesn't solve problems; you have to be judicious. You must 
either have a first-rate mechanic or become one yourself. For the first 
you pay up front, for the second you pay as you go up the learning curve.
