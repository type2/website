Subject: Re: Question:  Case Adapter Question

&gt;I currently have a 71 bus with a Type 1 case that has an adapter mounted
&gt;on the oil pump to allow it to mount to the rear hanger for my 71 Type
&gt;2.  I purchased the bus this way and I am having no problems with this
&gt;setup at the moment.  My question is if I should leave this setup alone
&gt;or if I should drill and tap the case to accept the rear hanger for the
&gt;71 Type 2.  Does anybody have any long-term experience with this
&gt;adapter?

I put a bug engine in my '69 bus about 10 years ago. I bought a set of 
cheap metric taps and drilled and tapped it myself. I used a hand drill,
so I was very careful. I used a couple of increasing sizes of bits until 
I got to the right size for the tap. 

NOTE: Be very carefull not to drill too deep! The main oil journal for
the
pressure relief valve is in line with one of the holes!

Good Luck,
