Subject: Re: [T2] What's this funny part on my 1.8L Type 4?

Mike, I'm pretty sure you're correct. I don't remember the details, but it
is some sort of sensor that can tell the diagnostic computer how fast
(RPMs) your engine is running. I believe it went to the diagnostic plug. If
you search the archives you might find it as I think it was discussed about
a year ago.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;that's so funny that you asked this question.  I was just thinking about
&gt;that today.  A few days ago I was working with my dad taking apart my
&gt;other engine and we came across that part.  It still had the plug on it,
&gt;so I pulled it out.  My dad guessed that it was for the vw diagnostic
&gt;computer hookup.  I'm guessing that there's a magnet imbedded on the
&gt;flywheel and that tells rpm to the computer hookup.  That's the only
&gt;thing I can think of.
