Subject: Quelle aventure!

Well, THAT was a learning experience!

OK, I didn't get a lot of photos--my mind was on other things, like 
keeping the bus going and monitoring the cat. Hopefully, this will help 
clear up the Art Lynch (TX) &amp; Art Long (OK) confusion (ha-ha).

I got back yesterday and have been getting settled back in. Slogging 
through e-mail.

First, I must say a huuuuge THANK YOU to EVERYONE who assisted and 
supported me, Wendelin, and Luna the Wonder Cat (after the lunatic who 
&quot;went retrograde&quot; 75 miles and waited a whole day in Bakersfield, TX, to 
rescue her) on our sojourn east. Mere words cannot express, etc., etc. 
And particularly H. Steve &quot;Don't Call Me 'Mr.'&quot; Dolan for always being 
the hero of the day (and keeping the cat).

Wendelin is in good safe hands in Atlanta with Chris Huff's mechanics -- 
they will do us right, or they'll have to deal with HER! :-) Rrrrowr, 
rrrrowr! Pffft, pffft!

When Kelly gets Steve's bus done, Steve's going to fly to Atlanta, drive 
Wendelin to Kelly's, and take his bus home. Get crackin', Kelly! :-) 
We'll all meet again at High Country (and after seeing Ric's place, I 
can't wait). Snoopy, can you wait a couple of months for your heater 
boxes? They're in the front seat of my bus....

Nikki
