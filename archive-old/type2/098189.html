&gt; &gt; I would not use these!  The RD-603, yes; the 603V, no.

&gt; Actually, the RD-603 and the 603v is the same tire. And they're

Hmm..  (no I still have not left for harpers Ferry and it is getting
closer and closer to rush hour... can you say &quot;internet addict&quot;?)

Well, I went out and looked at the Bridgestone tires I have on my Vanagon.
In big letters they say &quot;RD-603 Steel,&quot; in small letters, near the rim is
says &quot;603VZ&quot; as what I presume is the model.  The problem is that these
are two years old, and Bridgestone has probably been thru 6 more models
since then.  What you have, David, what I have, and what they are selling
Doyt have a fair chance of being completely different tires :-(  I'd
rather compare matresses!!!!

I like my RD-603 Steel tires fine.  They are not XZXs, but I have found
nothing that is.  I would gladly go back to XZXs tomorrow if Michelin
would start up making them again.  If the tires you are looking at are the
RD-603, I would say &quot;yes, Doyt, go for it&quot; but mine were not advertised as
&quot;highway rib&quot; and that is a term of art in tires that scares me.
