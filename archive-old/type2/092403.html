Subject: Camper Needed/Mechanic?

This is a two part question.

I'm looking for a bus for a friend. He'd like a camper from the mid to late 
70's (pre Vanagon). This bus needs to be in excellent shape. He is planning 
to retire this fall and would like to go on a trip with his wife. He wants 
me to look over any prospects and advise him of the purchase.

Part 1:
Does anyone know of a nice bus in the Indiana area? I'd also look in 
western Ohio, Eastern Illinois, Southern Michigan and northern Kentucky.


Part 2:
My friend lives in Waveland Mississippi, right on the gulf, not far from 
New Orleans. Does anyone know of a trusted mechanic fairly close to  his area?

Replies would probably be best served to my e-mail, captain_at_indy.rr_dot_com

Thanks!
Jim
