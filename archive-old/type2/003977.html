Hi Jason
I don't know much about FI either,,, but I don't think you should use a 009
anywhere, imho.
Sounds like your dist shaft is worn and the point gap is changing, or your
not tightening the clamp.
That is my 2 cents,, canadian,,, equivilent to 1.2 cents US
also , i forwarded it to the Type 2 list so someone may help you.

&gt;Hey I have a friend that has a 76 bubble window that the timing keeps
&gt;slipping on. You can time it and about 20 miles later, the timing is off
&gt;again. we've done it twice now and it's off again in no time. it has an
&gt;2000cc motor in it and everything is completely stock. I don't know too
&gt;much about fuel injection (after all, I'm on the VINTAGE bus list for a
&gt;reason), so I told her I'd give her a hand if it is in fact a bad
&gt;distributer. another question, will a 009 work in a 76 bus? I have 2 or 3
&gt;laying around that I can give her if they'll work. She also says it's
&gt;running hot, but I guessed it's because the timing's off. I think I'm on
&gt;the right track, I just wanted somebody that's dealt with type IV's to
&gt;re-assure me. Let me know if I'm way off, and tell me either way what to
&gt;do.
