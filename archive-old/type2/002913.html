Volks,
Has anyone out there purchased the adaptor from the bus depot that allows
you to swap from a York piston type compressor to a Sanden rotary
compressor?   Or has anyone made this swap and able to send me any pics?

The vehicle in question has a type 4 2 liter air-cooled motor in it.......I
have the original bracket and bad compressor.......want to make it work
right!

Any help is appreciated.
