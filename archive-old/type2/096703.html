Subject: Re: [T2] (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) Zits comic strip

--part1_ae.2a341ae1.2a696564_boundary

Hello All   have ant of you seen and been keeping up with the Zits comic 
strip. The kids are putting together a VW van that sometimes looks like a bay 
and others times it looks like a splittie. I was thinking that we should get 
these kids on the type 2 list to help them get this thing together better. 
Any ideas on how to email this comic strip.these kids need our help to say 
nothing about the poor guys writing the strip. :)  later and have fun   Mark
