&gt;It is true that you don't want to exceed 30-32 on a wedge chamber (no semi
&gt;hemi) engine UNDER FULL LOAD, but part throttle cruise requires another
&gt;10-15 degrees of timing (unless you like losing 4mpg and a hotter running
&gt;engine). If you understand how vacuum advance works, it disappears at 1/2
&gt;throttle, leaving you with the hose-disconnected timing (Wow, 30-32 degrees,
&gt;remember?).

What John says seems consistent w/ what I've been thinking, so I'll toss this out to see if I'm wrong.  I think that on TI and T4 engines (w/o semi hemi heads), the desirable max advance at plus 1/2 throttle under full load is the same: 30-32 deg BTDC.  The challenge is that if you put a timing light on a motor w/ a combined mechanical/vacuum advance distributor (i.e. the stock distributor for a 1600dp and the SVDA) and, w/ no load on the motor, pull the throttle open by hand until timing maxes out, the throttle never exceeds appx. 1/4 open.  At 1/4 throttle, the vacuum advance mechanism will be in play, thus the timing will be:
	initial setting (e.g. 7.5deg BTDC) plus
	Mechanical advance (e.g. 22 deg) plus
	vacuum advance (e.g. 10 deg) equals
	max advance reading (e.g. 39.5 degrees BTDC)
This is different from max advance at plus 1/2 throttle which will be:
	initial setting (e.g. 7.5deg BTDC) plus
	Mechanical advance (e.g. 22 deg) plus
	vacuum advance--0 deg. equals
	max advance reading (e.g. 29.5 degrees BTDC)
This is confusing to those seeking to set max advance while the bus is in driveway (i.e. me).  In theory you could estimate max advance at plus 1/2 throttle by subtracting the amount of advance provided by the vacuum advance mechanism.  In practice, the exact amount of advance provided by the vacuum advance mechanism at 1/4 throttle, no-load can't be determined very precisely.

I think that there is a solution:  To set max advance on a combined mechanical/vacuum advance distributor, disconnect the vacuum hoses (plug outlets on carb), set max. advance by pulling throttle open by hand until timing maxes out (you will be seeing the effects of the mechanical advance only).  This method is intended to mimic the conditions that should be present at plus 1/2 throttle (i.e. vacuum advance mechanism does not advance timing at plus 1/2 throttle).  Using this method, timing should be:
	initial setting (e.g. 7.5 deg BTDC) plus
	Mechanical advance (e.g. 22 deg) plus
	vacuum advance--0 deg. equals
	Max advance reading (e.g. 29.5 degrees BTDC)
Keep in mind that on a distributor w/ vacuum advance and vacuum retard (e.g. stock dist for 1600dp, but not SVDA), the specification is to set timing at 5 degrees ATDC at idle w/ vacuum hoses connected.  When you disconnect the vacuum hoses, timing at idle will advance to appx. 7.5 deg BTDC b/c the vacuum retard is no longer in play.  This doesn't change the procedure or really effect anything (I think it will cause idle speed to increase).

I'm no expert and don't claim to be right about this.  I am just tossing it out to see if it helps in an area that I have found confusing.

Question:  what should be the max advance setting at plus 1/2 throttle for a 1600dp w/ semi-hemi heads?
