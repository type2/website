Subject: The Big Bad Pull

Ok....I just took off the oil filler tube from the case and drained the oil. 
I got the engine almost all the way back to the rear apron..maybe another 
1/2&quot; to go. The damm trans shaft dosn't want to seperate from the engine. I 
can see inside the clutch area and can see a few broken 
washers..Hmmmm....looks like the throw out bearing bit the dust, but I won't 
know till I get the engine out. I have been pulling on the case as well as 
the jack trying to get the shaft to seperate...I only need another 1/2-1&quot; 
before it is cleared. It is getting dark hear vary fast and I would like to 
get this finished. Anyone have any tricks besides giving the case a good 
pull. all help appreciated.

Cheers....
