&gt; &gt;I have heard that a lot of ya'll son't like GEX engines. Why? 

Every GEX engine I have seen has limped in on it's last legs or
came out of the box with end play 2 to 3 times spec. You GEX what
you pay for and less when you buy GEX loss leader overhauled junk.

I've seen cases that look like they are the third rebuild iteration 
of a Baha racing buggy. I had another cheapo (GEX like) loss leader
motor that begin to knockin' upon start up and made about 100 miles
before it was toast. Thankfully, I told the client that if he bought
a loss leader californicated example he would have to do the leg work
and I would not garrentee other than my labor. 

Now I will not install a motor unless I rebuild it or it comes from a
machine shop with a proven, verifiable reputation, whatever that may cost. 

Rule of thumb, if you see RTV sealant anywhere on a German engine run
as fast as you can with your hand on your wallet. It's a sure sign of
someone who doesn't know or doesn't care about specifications and if
you buy in to such experiments you will end up with brown spots on the
garage floor and elsewhere when it hits home how much you wasted trying
to save money and now have to pay the REAL price for a REAL engine in
addition and wifey-poo is gettin' p.o.ed
