&gt; 	Sorry for being late on this thread. But your mail made me think, how am I
&gt; doing it? I'm so used to manual transmission that I don't think about it.

I learned to drive on a stick and my first car was a 59 beetle,  had 12
VW's of various types until my 71 van.

&gt; Handicapped people naturally get exeptions. Naturally you are allowed to

then I became disabled and didn't think I would be able to drive a VW
anymore, kept the 71 in the backyard for many years trying to figure out
how to make it an automatic.

time passes and I still want a bus, traded my Mercedes in for a 78 bus
with a HP bus drop floor and auto tranny and hand controls, have not
looked back since.

Have an old ad I found for HP bus in Billarica(sp) Mass. but have never
seen another one.  the center of the bus between the axles is lowered 15
inches and the area below the sliding door drops down to become a ramp.
really neat arangement with the lower door track.
