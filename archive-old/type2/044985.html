Subject: [T2] Need a new sink !!

     Any sources for a replacement for the plastic one piece sink for a '71
westy.  This is not the cover, but actually the sink itself which fits onto
the 3/4 inch ply top of the cabinet.  As a last resort - I will fabricate
one with a small RV aluminum sink and a laminate type surround.

Thanks,
