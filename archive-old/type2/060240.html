Subject: Dual Advance Distributer

Volks:

Loving my new Mexican engine!  Wish I had a dual
advance distributer, however.  Does anyone know of a
source for a mechanical/vacuum advance, or a dual
vacuum advance?  I'd rather stick with my vacuum
advance only (from a '69) then go with an 009 again.

TIA, 
Dan
