Subject: re:Door Lock Broken

A couple of months ago I got tired of how my door locks were working, so I 
did some maintenance.  A truly valuable resource was an article by Ron 
VanNess.  It's on the type2 website under Ness-Tek, Body, &quot;Replacing 69-79 
Bus Front Door Lock Spring&quot;.  Mine is a '68, too, but with the exception of a 
few minor details, all of what Ron put in his article applied to the '68.  I 
basically just followed what the article said.  I did order the spring for 
the front door lock from my VW dealer (they're still available and about 
$2.50 each...if you're cheap you could take a chance and see if one of yours 
is still OK and find a replacement at a hardware store; I just got them from 
the dealer).  Mine were in dire need of cleaning/degreasing and lube.  Once I 
did that and replaced the springs, mine work very smoothly.  Also, since we 
have a 1968 one-year-only part in the push-button door handles, there is an 
o-ring that fits around the cylinder/button and seals between the door handle 
and &quot;shoulder&quot; of the cylinder button.  I just went to a hardware store with 
the cylinder and found one that fit.  It works great!  The Haynes manual I 
have has a great exploded view of the '68 lock on page 189.  I also flushed 
the lock cylinder out with solvent (got lots of black stuff out), let it dry, 
and lubed the cylinder with some dry-film lubricant I got from the local 
locksmith who was able to cut my keys from code.  My locks are smooth, with a 
solid feel to them.  It took me about 1 to 1 1/2 hours per door taking my 
time.  It's really an easy job that just takes a little time.  Good luck!!
