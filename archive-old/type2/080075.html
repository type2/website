&gt; Would Load class &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; tire be more resistant to punctures than a
&gt; regular passenger type tire?

Chris,

The answer is probably yes, but it doesn't matter.  Take a 3&quot; drywall
screw, put it on the ground, point up. Put a tire on top of it. Give a
single blow with a 3,000 pound hammer moving at 60 miles per hour. OK?
'Nuf said?

The only way I know of to totally avoid flats is to get your tires filled.
If you go by a dealer in tires for earth-moving equipment, they can fill
your tires with a foam and guarantee that you will never have another
flat, but the price will be high, the ride will suffer and it ain't worth
it in our application.  (BTW, the drywall screw will still penetrate the
tire)   The various gooey fillers as are mentioned will prevent *most*
flats, but are a PITA in other regards and I would not have that done
either.
