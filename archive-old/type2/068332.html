Subject: Rheostatic Switch for Bilge Blowers

I've been looking for a rheostatic switch for a bilge blower and
I'm not finding anything suitable.  It seems that the blower will
draw about 3.5 amps at 13.6 V.

Is there any chance that the dimmer portion of a '66 headlight 
switch could handle the load or would it just fry?

I guess I could yank an old fan switch out of an old bug or
something like that...would've been nice to use a switch that 
matches the rest...

...Markus
