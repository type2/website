There is a major reason why VW went to the TIV for busses.

The lifespan of all  TI powered busse4s is shorter, it just really works the
engine bigtime. It is hard to find a TI powered bus with over 50K on the
enguine without problems.

&gt; I know what i am asking has been asked many times before so i think
&gt; people should probably respond of list to keep repetition to a minimum.
&gt; I have a 78 westy and have had it for 5 years. I have decided that i
&gt; think i would prefer a standard bus (seems like they are the rarities at
&gt; shows now) Having only owned type 4 powered buses i am a bit spoiled, i
&gt; have only owned westies.
&gt; My debate is this;  would a type one powered bus be a better choice due
&gt; to cost and supply of type 1 engine parts or do the benefits of a nice
&gt; FI type 4 out weigh these costs.  I am also thinking in terms of labor
&gt; costs as i am personally much less threatened by doing repairs on a 1600
&gt; than type 4's partially.  Another thing that is quite clear to me is
&gt; that the supply of type 1 engine parts will long outlive that of type 4
&gt; parts and it is part of my dilemma.
&gt; What i am hoping for is to get a nice variety of opinions, polite ones
&gt; please :-),
&gt; to help sway me one way or another.
&gt; thanks in advance
