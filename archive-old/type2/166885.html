Subject: Hey!  Mark!

Hiya Mark,

In several postings here at Type 2 you have mentioned that you have drilled holes in the hub of early baywindow steering wheels for easier removal.? Makes a lot of sense to me.? I?really don't want to have to take a chance on wrecking the plastic when I pull the wheel, especially after restoring the wheel.

But I do have a question for you............how do you account for the turn signal canceling ring?? It looks to me like I'm going to have to drill though that also.? And it also looks like drilling through it will turn it into a piece of swiss cheese.? That's pretty much what happened when I drilled the wheel already in place in the bus in order to remove it (and that removal went very well - thanks!).

Is there something I'm overlooking here?? Any details you may be able to provide will certainly be appreciated.

Mike
