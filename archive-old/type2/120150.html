Subject: Painting Bumpers??

Hey Guys,

    When looking at a FACTORY VW Transporter from 1973, what color should the bumper mounting brackets in the rear be painted? Should they be painted the color of the bumpers? Or the color of the body?

My Bus when I got it, with the exception of the roof, was all one color. I'm trying to revert this Bus back to stock looking as much as possible.

Also, the air vent grill should always be the same color as the body, correct?



Thanks!

Todd
