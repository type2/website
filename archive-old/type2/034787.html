&gt; Hi,
&gt;  
&gt;  We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a 46mm
&gt;  nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb
&gt;  torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use with 
it
&gt;  other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for 
that
&gt;  with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
&gt;  around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our local
&gt;  stores.

Hi Jen,

Its likely that you won't find a 46mm socket in 1/2 drive so you will end up 
with a 3/4 inch drive socket and breaker bar. these will be easier to find 
somewere that specialses in tools for lorries or Farm tractors (or VWs)

The torque wrench problem is easier to over come - put a long scaffold pole 
on the breaker bar, put a mark on it at a measured distance from the centre 
of the nut, divide the required number of foot pounds by the distance of your 
mark from the centre (in feet), hold the bar at the mark, stand on the 
bathroom scales and pull up until your weight 'increases' by the amount 
you've just worked out.

Good luck
