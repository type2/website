Subject: Radios

I was looking around for a radio for G today and couldn't find an
inexpensive AM/FM stereo radio with memory buttons.  Nothing below $70.00
anyway.

I plan on installing an MP3 Player (already on hand to be installed), and
want something for the dash that isn't shiny enough to interest thieves.  Or
at least is cheap enough to replace should a less-than-bright thief rips it
off.

Any suggestions?
