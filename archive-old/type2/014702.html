Also there is a spring assembly inside that becomes worn or broken.  The door 
has to be opened with tough fingers pulling and a twist of the handle.  I am 
going to replace mine next week, mine is doing that and I'm tired of everyone 
cutting threw the front.  Plus even when working we use it minimally with 
non-dubbers to eliminate the slamming frenzy.  This job is best done from the 
inside with the door closed.  loosen the bolts in the rear  top corner and 
pull the door panel.  inside you'll see the works, go slow and use lithium 
grease or bearing grease  i like WD40 but it is more of a quick fix or rust 
inhibitor and by no  means should be used as a primary lubricant.  good luck, 
and the parts are inexpensive used in good shape.  Just my approach.
Peace Out
