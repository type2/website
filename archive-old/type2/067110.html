On the TV over here (UK) we have a program called &quot;Tomorrows World&quot; which 
takes a look at technologies for the future.

Last night they had an article on 'running your car on water'

As they went on to explain this was a mixture of naptha (a by product of 
distalation of oils), water and a SECRET incrediant.

Apprently it overcomes the problem of engine rust and can run in most engines
with little modification. (I bet that excludes VW flat fours:-))

It's being researched in California and 'Catapiler' have some trucks running
on it.

Any-one out there know more on this?
