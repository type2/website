Subject: Maggie Progress Report: Day 1

Well, the engine is out.  It lieth upon the ground.  And I haven't picked
up any smokes yet.  At least not any tobacco.

Everything went moderately well, until the final pull, where in the lower
engine studs bent upon final removal.  Bad is what I mean.  Yuck yuck yuck.

But what's done is done.  Now I guess I have to completely dismantle the
thing to replace those studs.

Anyway, there it is, it's out, and I personally didn't sustain any serious
injuries.

And for all those who were wondering at my incomplete initial post: Maggie
is  76 westy, and my only motorized transportation.

But, I am doing it.  I'll walk through this.  My thanks to John Muir for
writing such an excellent book.

See yall tomorrow about this same time.

Eric
Maggie
