Subject: [T2] Flying to NY to pick up '73 Panel

I'm flying to NY to pick up a '73 European Panel Bus tomorrow night.

The plan is to drive it back to St. Louis.

I'm taking every imaginable part and tool that I can check on the plane with 
me.

The bus has sat inside for many years, but has recent new tires, brakes, carb 
cleaning, oil change, and fuel tank cleaning.

I'll take it easy and hope to make it home on Sunday.  

I'll have my AIRS list with me, but if anyone sees a bright red panel bus 
broken down between Long Island and St. Louis, please stop and say hello, or 
at least honk and wave as you drive by.
