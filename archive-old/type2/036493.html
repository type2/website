Subject: Anyone around Lockwood CA?

Which is apparently about the middle of nowhere as CA goes, maybe
halfway between SF and LA on US 101.  Nearest towns of any size
maybe King City, Paso Robles, and San Luis Obispo (that's pushing it.)

Need a Bus camper looked at, can't offer much for the favor, maybe
a case of beer if I actually come out and buy the thing.

Need someone who can look at body and interior more than anything
else, the mechanicals aren't so important to me.

Thanks,

John
