Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AMP meter and shunt

i missed a real answer here....
the shunt resistor is in series with the load and the meter reads across
it.

               shunt
-----------0--/\/\/\--0---------
           |          |
           --(meter)--

a little math. shunt resistor .25ohms and current for max deflection
4amps.
4 x .25 = 1 volt _at_ max deflection.

really simply if you want 4x the range just divide the shunt by 4.
.25 / 4 = .0625 ohm for max deflection at 16 amps.
and power requirement for said r is 16(2) x .0625 = 16 watts.


im not sure if you are going to find a 1/16 ohm 20w resistor so easily.
a simple  solution is 2  1/8 ohm 10w resistors in parallel.

a little math to show its correct?
16 x .0625 = same 1 volt we got originally.

hope that helps.

and i hope i havent gotten mad cow and just made up some
nonsensical gibberish mooo hoo hooh ooh oooooooo


&gt; Did you mean to write 1 mA? There's a ton of
&gt; difference between 1 MA and 1 mA. 1 MA, (megaampere),
&gt; is 1,000,000 amps and 1 mA, (milliampere), is .001
&gt; amp.

&gt; &gt;I recently bought a 4 amp meter that has these
&gt; &gt;instructions:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot; Westinghouse panel meter manufactured for RCA with
&gt; &gt;a range of 4 amps DC. Please note that a .25 ohm _at_ 5
&gt; &gt;watt meter shunt is required. The basic movement of
&gt; &gt;this meter is 1 MA. &quot;
