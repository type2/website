1) I'm a big fan of Mobile One 15w-50 syn, opinions vary, but I've 
documenteded a 15 deg. (f) decrease in oil temp with this stuff. Expensive. 
Castrol GTX 20w-50 should also do right by you.
2)89 oct. gas. I cruise at 70-75mph, no problems. Oil temp, at 90+deg. and 
mucho humidity tops at 215(F) oil pressure at 42psi, 3625 rpm. All of this is 
at near sea level, however. 
Semi stock eng., ' 78 2.0L FI, everything zero balanced, 8.25-1 compression 
ratio(MSHP Zero deck height heads, six stud system), C/W crank, CDI ign, 
along with a Pertronix Ignitor.
Good luck,
Parker
