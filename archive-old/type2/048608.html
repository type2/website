Seats aren't all that hard to do.  You can buy upholstery from various
sources already sewn up and ready to install.  You strip the old fabric
and padding from your seats, repair broken springs, the replace the
padding and fabric.  The padding is available preformed or you can make
your own from carpet and foam.

The upholstery goes on like a sock, no sewing required.
