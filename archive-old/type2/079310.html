Subject: Re: type2 Digest 11 Jan 2002 16:00:00 -0000 Issue 579

dot 5 is made for modern cars - specifically, ones that have never had 3 or
4 in em!  unless you take your bus to a good shop to vacuum out the old
fluid, flush with alcohol or sumpin and then put in the 5, you will have
trouble.

i believe there are some issues with older rubber, too, but they were on an
old ch*vy truck list, so can't say about the german rubber.
if i remember it has something to do w/ the silicone content.

last, this fluid is NOT hygroscopic - ie, it will not absorb water. this
would SEEM to be a good thing, but it means that water will accumulate in
your system... like in a low spot in a brake line, or a cylinder, leading
to internal rust, unless you periodically empty and completely flush it
with wood alcohol... like  racers do! the old, hygroscopic stuff absorbs
the water, and helps prevent some of this rusting;  when your brake fluid
turns cloudy, it is time to replace it!
i'm not sure what the makers of dot 5 think about this issue on a modern
car... likely, they think 'hey, when the brake system rusts out, they'll
need a new car!  cool!'

its just like using GL5 tranny oil in a bus - DON'T!!  many new products
ARE better than the old stuff, but many are designed to work SPECIFICALLY
with modern cars, which use different materials/production methods.


and whatevr you do DO NOT ask the guys at the parts counter about stuff
like this - 'oh yeah, ya NEED that stuff nowadays. everyone uses it. $12.95
pleez.'   research it yourself, in the archives and on the web.........
