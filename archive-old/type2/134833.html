Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

THIRD TIMES A ....!?

Ummm it takes HP to run the alternator that produces the 12v DC that the A/C
unit runs on... It will definitely draw more HP with the A/C on. As you say,
the bigger issue is the ugly rooftop A/C unit. :-)

I will follow this one for sure, I'm in SW Florida, want a bus and always
watch for different A/C solutions that come up.

PS, how the heck does anyone get a friggin reply through with any quoted
material in it? (I though I figured it out about 10 times over now but every
new reply is back to &quot;FAILURE NOTICE&quot;, no wonder I reply so infrequently to
the list...
