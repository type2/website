Subject: 56K or 156K miles

As I have mentioned before, I recently purchased a 1970 Camper with
supposedly 56K original miles, but I have no documentation to prove this.
Judging by the shape, that is probably true, but here are my questions...

My motor is out and I posted last week about what I should do while it is
out.  I decided to pull the heads off today and noticed that the surface of
the exhaust valves are rather &quot;crusty&quot;.  Like rough...

1) I am thinking it is no biggie, but is it?  Also, the intake valves all
look good except for #3.  All the others have a nice shiny oily look, while
number 3 looks to have carbon or something on it, and have a flat
appearance, not glossy because of oil like the others...Hmmm.

I want to do whatever I can while the motor is out, but at the same time
want to keep all the original stuff that I can if at all possible.  How can
I find out if these are the original pistons and jugs?  Ditto for the
heads.  That I think will give me some type of indication if I am looking
at 56K or 156K.  I don't think I would have 105# of compression if they
were the originals and the mileage was 156K.

2) As I said, my compression was 105# when I checked it before I removed
it, so I really don't want to replace the jugs unless I have to because I
don't think it needs it.  Plus if these are the originals, I would rather
keep them as long as possible.  However, should I ring it?  I am replacing
the seals and cleaning all the mating sufraces, so the jugs will be off
anyway.

2.5)  If I do repalce the jugs, is that a bad idea to just do that and not
split the case?  I mean, does it create any
i-don't'know-pressure-or-something on the internal parts to not split the
case and just do everything?

3)  I have the original VW fuel pump and oil cooler.  I am of course going
to clean out the fuel pump and repalce the filters inside, but is there any
reason to replace it?  Again, I would rather keep the VW one if possible.
Ditto for the oil cooler.

4)  Any magic solution to clean up the heads and will it hurt anything to
soak them complete (all assemebled) ?  I may try the hot TSP.

Thanks for reading my ramblings and answering any of the above questions.
I want this Westy to be a daily driver, so I want to make sure things are
done right.  I don't feel it needs a full rebuild, but would like opinions.

Ask quesitions...That's how you learn stuff...
