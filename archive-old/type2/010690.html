I have a BA6 too, but wouldn't really use it for a &quot;camper heater&quot;. Although
the thing totally kicks butt when you are moving down the road, I've found
that if you ignite the heater while you're sitting around, exhaust fumes are
everywhere. It would work okay for a quick heat up while you get dressed in
the am, but will wear a battery down pretty quick (glow plug, combustion
blower, aux fan blower) if you use it too much.
