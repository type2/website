&gt; Well, I have my first sorta serious problem.  I went to fill the bus yesterday
&gt; &amp; fuel came leaking out from the left side.  I am assuming it is one of the
&gt; hoses to the tank.  Maybe both are bad.  I know the top one is available from
&gt; Bus Depot but the bottom hose is NLA.  I have searched the archives &amp; believe
&gt; that the 2 1/4&quot; ID fuel hose from NAPA will work for both hoses.  Is this
&gt; correct?  Does anyone know how many feet I will need?  I have the microfiche
&gt; of the area but it is not really to scale.  This is scary stuff.  I want to
&gt; fix this this weekend.

When I fixed my tank in March I went to NAPA for hose.  I bought:

1055 NBH GAS HOSE $16.49

It's sold by the foot so you can make one major mistake.  This part # is the
right fit.  It's also the right kind of hose for gasoline.

While you are in there replace the filler neck also:

I also bought some better hose clamps to make see it was a tight fit:

705-1019 BK HOS CLMP $1.19 (each x 3)

See this image:

Because the original hose had a bend in it you'll need to approximate the
bend by cutting one end of your hose at an angle.  Keep making bigger angles
until you've got a good right around the back.

If you can find a molded piece that is gasoline compatible and the right
size go with that obviously.
