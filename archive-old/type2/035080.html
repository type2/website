&gt; sell it IF your heart can afford it... :-(
well,

i will respectfully disagree with you here sami...  I have put over 50k
miles on my bus in the last 2 years give or take, and i found that driving
my bus everywhere has been a cure for my automotive hypochondria.  What i
have had to do is research and learn and research and learn.  Once my
knowledge of my bus got to a sufficient point and i learned to trust my
own mechanical judgement i was able to relax and trust my bus.

Also, driving it everywhere all the time we have kindf of bonded and i can
feel whats going on, i have a deeper appreciation for it having lived with
it regularly for a couple of years.

My recommendation is to have a good place to store stuff and STOCK UP on
spare parts.  Have whatever you need on hand so that you can get your bus
running again in a weekend no matter what happens (personaly i have a
spare engine, transmission, brakes, bearings, cv's etc.)

I have a second car when my bus just wont go, and i recommend this.  IMHO,
get on old watercooled vw for this duty, or a bug, or a bus, whatever
your heart desires...  Or have a rental car fund to get you through the
week until you can fix your bus on the weekend.

Keeping spares on hand isnt expensive, just space consuming.  I have been
picking up my spares as i run into good deals over time, and nothing has
set me back a big bunch...

If you get in over your head, suck up and find a mechanic that KNOWS
busses, im sure they can get it going in short order.  Join a VW club
in your area and ask around for who is good. 

I drive my bus daily and plan on doing so until i cant anymore.

peas,

Steve
