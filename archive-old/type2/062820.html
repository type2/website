Subject: Advice needed for a 78' bus (fwd)

I just bought a 78 bus for $400. It has a progressive dual carb rather 
than fuel injection so at least one thing is in my favor.
 The transmission is stuck in second and 
the muffler assemble is in the back seat. There is some heavy rust on 
the corner front wheel well and holes on the steps.  But in general the 
body is whole. The help I need is trying to figure out where to start. 
Take out the rust on the edges or get the damn thing running. The engine 
does run but the CV are currently in the back seat. Oh yes the heater 
pipes are missing under the body. Except for rust on the edges the metal 
on the interior is fine. Any suggestions except crushing it into a block 
would be appreciated :)

Thanks,
Steve Hajasz
