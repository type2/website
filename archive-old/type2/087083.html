Subject: Re: [T2] MAX out your Propane Capacity / Do propane tanks HAVE to
 be Cylindrical?

&gt; I am toying with the idea of a dual fuel setup (there is a 
&gt; guy in the UK that has kits for air cooled vans). But to 
&gt; make this worthwhile at all I need more propane capacity, 

a lot more since propane has a lower btu than gasoline

&gt; under the sliding door (No I dont want to put the tank 
&gt; inside the van, nor do I want a larger or second gas tank).

inside is usually illegal for that size/volumne
&gt; 
&gt; Must a propane tank be cylindrical to hold the gas safely? 

actually round is better, cyl is a compromise

&gt; What kind of PSI do they hold? My scuba tanks are rated for 
&gt; 3000 PSI 

some considerably more. especially the carbon fibre tanks

&gt; and I assume they too are cylindrical for 
&gt; engineering reasons.

yup
&gt; 
&gt; In an ideal world, laws of physics aside (OK maybe the sides 
&gt; could be rounded), I would love to get a tank that was only 
&gt; about 4 to 6&quot; tall x 12&quot; wide x 36&quot; long. This would fit 
&gt; neatly under each sliding door.
&gt; 
&gt; What about the possibility of putting two 6&quot; tanks side by 
&gt; side between the fame rails for a total of 4 tanks? How 

that is what most vehicle applications do.  I work in the transit industry
and LPG, LNG, CNG are popular alternative.  some buses have tanks on the
roof 15-20 ft long and 8 inches or so in diameter, 4 of these will get a
single deck, 40ft (12meter)bus about 100 miles

&gt; would you link them all together? How would you do a fill?

with a manifold, fairly straight forward and simple.  emergency shut off
valves etc.  if you put em under the bus be sure to put a skid plate under
them to protect em.

good luck, keep us up to date on your success
