&gt; 
&gt; Here's one I hope someone can help me out with.  I have a '63 kombi that
was
&gt; mostly complete when I got it.  However a few things were missing, one of
&gt; which was the starter.  I'll be buying a new one this weekend and just
need
&gt; to figure out where the wires hook up to it.  When I look at the space
where
&gt; it goes, there's a small box mounted above where the starter goes with
three
&gt; wires coming out of it.  Two are black and one is red.  one of the black
ones
&gt; has a push on connector and the other black wire and the red one have the
&gt; round type connectors that go over a bolt.  Basically, I'd just like to
know
&gt; what the box is and where the three wires hook up.  If no one knows, I'm
sure
&gt; I can figure it out, but I thought it would be easier to ask.  Also,
where
&gt; does the positive wire from the battery go- to the starter or the
solenoid?
&gt;  Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

The little box is an aftermarket (generic) relay installed to eliminate the
classic turn-the-key-nothing-happens syndrome. One wire connects to the
battery, one to the starter solenoid and one to the wire from the ignition
switch (apparently this one gets ground from the mounting screws). Using a
jumper from the battery, touch each of the connections, the one that makes
it click is the connection for the starter switch.  One of the others
should be marked with a B (hopefully) for battery if you clean off the
grease. It might be worth getting a new relay at your generic auto parts
house just to get the wiring schematic and a new/reliable relay. They only
cost about $5.00
