&gt;Do I hear a HUNDRED BUCKS??????? Let's move it on out.

I have several offers of $100. Must offer more to be in the running. Offers
considered until
cash or cash equivalent is in my hands.

This is a liquidation designed to get this thing out from in front of my
shop ASAP.

For freight info, contant Friday Harbor Freight Lines, (360) 378-2012, fax
360 378-6999.

I will not even think about where to get a pallet to mount it on until cash
is in hand.

Thank you for your interest.
