I painted my bus rattle can style, and it is a good 20/20 (looks ok at
20ft or at 20mph)

&gt; bus and it will never be a show bus nor would i ever want it to be a show 
&gt; bus....but i want to to be rust free and in good mechanical shape.

one of the nice things about rattle can paint is that if something happens
it is easy to touch up, vandals hit mine about 2 years ago and painted
grafitti on the side panels, only took a couple hours to sand the worst
off and hit it with some paint from the same color batch..._dot_can't tell
where it happened

&gt; I don't expect my spray can job to last long but figure I might want it 
&gt; another color in a year or two anyways or maybe next time i'll do it the 
&gt; right way.

well mine has lasted 8 years and still looks decent..but I did use high
quality automotive rattle cans, about 6-7 dollars a can or so...
