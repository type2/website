Hey all,

A few questions... anyone in New Jersey that really knows how the new
inspection/emissions testing relates to us people with a '73 bus (with a Weber
conversion)? I got lucky and don't have to worry about it till next year, but
I want to plan ahead.

Second, has anyone reproduced the side window seals (with vents), or is anyone
planning on it? There must be thouands of bay window buses left that need
these seals.

Thanks,
Rodney
