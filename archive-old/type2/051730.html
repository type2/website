Subject: [T2] Axle Beam Project-DONE!

Hey Folks,
   Well , it's been 4 (maybe 5) long weekends (and some weeknights)but
today I finished my axle beam replacement. All I had to do today was hook
up the brake fluid reservoir to the master cylinder and bleed the brakes.
That didn't take too long, and she finally had the front wheels back on and
I moved her out into the driveway for a bath. The only problem I noticed
was is with the shifter-I replaced the front shift rod bushing while I had
everything apart, and now it does not want to go from third to second.
First to second is fine, and I can get it into every other gear fine, but
it binds going from third to second. This has been a real education, and
I've enjoyed doing it, but I'm glad it's done. Many thanks to Steve Dolan
and Mike Gensler for their excellent write up's in the type2 library. I
ended up replacing far more parts than I had planned on, and I took the
time to take each and every part I removed and clean/repaint it, and
replacing every seal/grommet/bushing I came across, which is why it took so
long. Also, all new brake hoses and lines. PO was quoted a $1,000.00 to do
this job, and while that probably didn't include all the stuff I replaced,
it's easily worth every penny. I'm one step closer to Everybus 2001!   
Jeff S.
