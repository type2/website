Dean,

The two words, good, and cheap are not synonymous.

You could go to K-Mart and get yourself a roller and a brush, and buy
some house paint, and do it that way, but it wouldn't last.

You could buy some cheap enamel and Wagner airless spray gun, and spit
the paint on, but that wouldn't last either.

If you really want to splurge, take it Earl Scheib, or Maaco, and this
might buy you a year or two, for a couple of hundred bucks.
They use the cheapest automotive paint on earth, no primer, barely any
preparation.

These are the cheapest methods available.

(&quot; The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the Sweetness of
the good deal is gone&quot;)

Have Fun,
