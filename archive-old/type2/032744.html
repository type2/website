Subject: Bus for sale(page moved)

Hey Volks, Yesterday, I created my first page with a
bus for Sale..Well, I can't get it to pull up so I
went with an easier Method. The 123 from AOL..much
easier and it worked. Check it out if your interested
in buying a great bus..or if you just interested. I
know the page is a lil cheezy but what can you do..Oh,
A big THANK YOU to the person who sent me the bracket
for my little table that connects to the sink and ice
box. It works perfect. I lost your email address but
wanted to say thanks. Anyway, check out my page and
buy my bus! I can't afford to have two buses right
now.

Thanks,

Greg
