&gt;Letsee, 2.0 FI on a carbed 1.7. That's different cam profiles, different

OK lets have a look at some facts.  L-jet is the first of the Bosch
AFC systems, that's air flow controlled boys and girls.  As in,
doesn't really matter a bit about most of the afore mentioned
problems.  L-jet is real simple, a given air flow equals a given
amount of fuel, slightly richer than stoichiometric.  Up to the 1.7
liters of gulping at any given rpm, the L-jet won't care what size
engine it is on.  Now I will quantify a few things.  I've only put it on
a 1.8, not a 1.7, BUT see above discourse.  There will be two
problems, the idle mixture is adjusted for a 2.0, as is the full throttle
enrichment, BUT both of these will be rich, and rich doesn't kill
engines.  The idle you can adjust, the full throttle will always be slightly
rich, but you really don't operate at full throttle that much of the
time.  Cam profiles, been there, changes are trivial over the years at
best, plus you sure aren't going to be replacing that stick with anything
but the one available stock grind now days for use in ANY solid lifter
engine from 1,7 to 2,0 so that doesn't hold, and if you are running an
origional, unrebuilt, 1.7 then you probably don't indeed need the
conversion as the thing is a 50k mile garage queen.  Combustion
chamber design differences, trivial, CR damn near the same all engines
in bus service.

&gt;Cross your fingers and start swapping parts. Can you say &quot;iterative
&gt;process&quot;? Stock is ALWAYS the shortest route to lowest cost street
&gt;drivability, ALWAYS. Cause it was designed by a team of engineers everyone

Simply is not the case, Tim fails to note he probably bought damn near
the last available new set of dual carbs on the planet, and I'd warrant 8
or 10 of the last 1.7's or 1.8's I've seen have been sporting a nice single
Weber (right.)  Now I recall Ron wanting about $400 for the set, and I
don't recall if that included linkage and manifolds, and it sure didn't
include the air cleaner, idle crossover system, etc. etc.  So buying a
&quot;stock&quot; dual carb set is largely academic, you're heading for the yards,
and those will need rebushed, and finding all the bits is pretty damn tough
these days.  Any way round I'd guess to the tune of at LEAST $500 if
you start with nothing to bring a set to reliable serviceable condition.

Now I'm not arguing if you've got good running dual carbs to run out and
swap to FI (I would personally though) but if you got a POS Weber and
it ices up, and runs like crap, dollar for dollar you can take a good
running 2.0 FI system and bolt it right on, and it will run clean, powerful,
and never have a worry about winter mornings, altitude changes, or any
of the other carb problems.  That team of engineers switched to FI 2
years later, and the same engineers had D-jet and L-jet on the contemporay
year 914's.  If you are that worried you could track down a 1.8 L-jet system
to be closer to displacement, but I wouldn't bother with the 411/412 or
914 D-jet, there isn't a need.  Late buses with good FI are a dime a dozen
in yards all across the country if you look a bit.  Yeah like I said, you need
to get it all (including the distributor) and you need to be sure it ran OK
before you pulled it.

&gt;an engineer who recognizes excellent design and function when he sees it.

As am I, just I'm an engineer who appreciated progress and have never
been afraid of it.

&gt;As long as you resonably MAINTAIN everything in spec per factory interval
&gt;or better, which for the large majority of us is a servere use schedule of
&gt;inspections, your cost per mile for the interval of ownership will bring
&gt;tears to the eyes of anyone with a roan Scottish tint to their hair. Just
&gt;think of it. No tow bills to the shop from hell to have it fixed wrong and
&gt;re-fail in short order, no late to work screwdriver pokin' slang creation
&gt;sessions, no unforseen problems attacking your budget due to inadvertent
&gt;failure founded in lack of maintenance. It is so much cheaper to over
&gt;maintain your vehicle than to under maintain it, when you honestly consider
&gt;ALL the costs.

I fully agree, try to go buy jets or rebuild parts for those carbs.  It's
easier
to find and maintain the FI if you don't fear it, it does require as I said at
the outset, common sense and some skill, if you have neither it is not a
conversion for you, but then again you probably can't set up a set of VW
dual carbs either.  If I had a 1.7 with a weber or worn stock dual carbs, or
even a set of DRLA's or IDF's without electric chokes, you can better believe
that for around here (WV with 2000 ft elevation changes and subfreezing
winters) I'd swap immediately to a 2.0 FI setup, in fact I have a 1.8, and
drove it EVERYDAY all winter, 70 miles each way on a commute to work.
I'm not saying I wouldn't install a set of new dual carbs if I could get them
I'm just saying it is unrealistic to expect I could, and would cost more than
a FI system I would trust equally.  I'll note in closing, the L-jet is a very,
very reliable system.  Seldom does an ECU truly fail (ususally just idiot
mechanics misdiagnosing problems), and everything else is pretty
bulletproof given as Tim says, normal regular maintainence.  Injectors and
fuel pumps are the worst, but still good for over 100k miles if you change
your fuel filter and ideally install the CA vanagon secondary filter.  AFM's
will go 150k if they aren't &quot;tinkered with.&quot;  Even if you bought new injectors
($100) a new pump Piersburg pump ($100) and a rebuilt AFM ($250 or so)
you'd still be better off IMHO, and I wouldn't do a one of those I'd just get
good used spares.
