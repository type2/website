Subject: free vanagon/late bay? rear seat in the eugene/spfld area
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was at the St. Vincent, DE Paul as is store on Broadway in Eugene yesterday 
and saw a brown vinyl late model bay or vanagon seat sitting outside the 
fence. Guess somebody dumped it off after hours and they didn't think enough 
of it to bring it in. upholstery looked to be in good shape. some cleaning 
needed. Please don't ask me to go get it and send it anywhere. Just thought 
I'd post for the hordes of bus owners in Eugene.
