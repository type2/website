Subject: [T2] DPD Air Conditioning unit

I recently bought a '69 Bus and was suprised to find this cool a/c unit
under the dash. This is my first air-cooled VW and am unfamiliar with all
these spiffy after-market add on's. I'm getting totally obsessed with fixing
my Bus and buying manuals; thus, my question:

Is there anyone out there with spec sheets or and operating manual for this
a/c unit. It was installed in the Bus in '72 in San Antonio, TX. I looked
all through the archives and found some interesting info, but no leads in my
direction. The company seems to be defunct-at least no where to be found in
San Antonio. I'll pay for xerox copies and shipping (I live in Austin).

Thanks for all the help this list brings as I have been finding it
overwhelmingly helpful in the rebuilding of my '69.
