Subject: Clutch Pedal Travel Question

My '77 bus had nothing on the floorin the front until last night, just bare sheet metal, I made a 1 piece mat out of 3/8&quot; horse stall mat from the ranch supply, it turned out very cool, quieted down the noise and cut down on the frostbite on my toes.

A few months ago I lost my clutch getting on the freeway and it turned out that the top bolt where the end of the cable attaches to the tranny had busted off.

I am thinking now that the pedal travel was designed for the pedal to not go all the way to the sheetmetal so repeated full travel hits busted the bolt.

Wouldn't the pedal be designed to have a carpet and insulating pad under it?  So having full travel to the sheetmetal is actually too far?

I can't feel anything wrong with the clutch now that it is hitting this 3/8&quot; mat but I also do not know how to tell if I am not pressing the clutch far enough.

Should I be worried that I may not be pressing the clutch far enough?

If I should be worried how can I check?

I cut out the entire perimeter of the gas pedal so it goes all the way down still, if the brake pedal makes it to the mat I have bigger problems.

Thanks,
James
