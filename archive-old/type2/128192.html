Subject: Re: [T2] How does one aquire H20 in gastank?

&gt;You may want to drop the tank to inspect it.  

I agree with Tom here and want to state that it is pretty easy to drop. 
I blocked up the front of the tank and let the rear down with a scissor
jack (floor jack better) to reach in and disconnect the wire to the fuel
gage sender.  Can't remeber if I removed the filler neck first - seems
like one would have to.  Then I believe I had a few blocks towards the
rear and let it down on those.  It's pretty light. I just slid it out at
that point on cardboard. I replaced all the vent lines, fuel lines and
filler neck seal at that time.  I cleaned and painted the tank and you
would not beleive how much dirt and grime accumulated on top.  If this
was in a wet climate, I can see how the top of thank would rust.
