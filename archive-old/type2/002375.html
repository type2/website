Well it is about time I announce that I am Tim and a VW junkie.  I was 
given a 74 Sunbug and now own the sunbug a super beetle a 68 7 passenger 
and a 70 campmobile.  I have learned that VW's are like potato chips no 
body can own just one. 

Any how the super beetle and the 68 bus are becoming donors and thus the 
next few questions.

All vehicles are type 1 motors. 

Is the starter the same for the busses and the beetles?

Are the bug and bus trannies interchangeable?

Can I take the Disc brakes off the Super and put them on the bus if not 
will they go on the sunbug (std beetle)

I pulled the engine from the super beetle (75 or 76) and put it in the 
bus.  It had an alternator on it.  I couldn't figure out the wiring on 
it so I put the old gen on it.  I would prefer the alternator.  It is 
the same as the one on my bug but different from the ones I have seen.
Most I see have posts similar to a gen but this one has a round plug 
harness on the top.  After that I don't know where to turn for help I 
really would rather have the alt
