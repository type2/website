Hi all, just wanted to tell you about my expierence entering my transvair
bus in my first car show, this was a corvair show in Palm Springs, Calif. 
last weekend, and I was in the enginered class, along with corvair powered
myers maxes and trikes etc. All my work paid off and the bus turned alot of
heads and was photographed alot and will soon be on the internet, so all
can check it out, especially some of the skeptics on the type 2 list. as
soon as I get the address I'll pas it on.
   I drive this bus everyday to work and back which is 86 miles and I go
over a 3,000 ft mountain top to get there....I just wanted to say for a
daily driver this bus is clean and I am very proud of it and it was great
to get some appreciation for all my efforts.

                                                 thanks to all my corvair
friends and type 2 friends
                                                  the best combination on
the planet..........Keith
