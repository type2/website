Subject: Re: [T2] Freaky Electrical Problem on '68 Bus

Just a guess, but I would check the dimmer relay. The headlight switch sends
power runs through the dimmer relay en route to the high and low beams.
Turning the lights off and on may jolt a failing dimmer relay unshorting it
for a while.

Cheers,

Subject: [T2] Freaky Electrical Problem on '68 Bus


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; My 68 Bus has been having the worst electrical problems. Right now after
&gt; driving for a few minutes I will suddenly lose all power to the motor,
&gt; lights, radio - everything! It became the most noticeable in the past few
&gt; weeks when I would turn on the directional and the indicator lights would
&gt; not come on and sometimes I would also get the dim generator light but
this
&gt; would only last for less than a minute then all would be fine again. More
&gt; recently I would get this same problem but now I would have to shock(?)
the
&gt; power back on again by turning the headlights on which simultaniously
&gt; results in a quick loss of power to the engine (would almost stall it out)
&gt; but then this (headlight flashing action) gives me my power back again.
&gt;
&gt; Right now when I go to start the car it will usually start but then it
will
&gt; suddenly lose power and stall as if the battery is dead (very very dim
dash
&gt; lights). When this happens I can eventually get it started by just playing
&gt; with the headlight and or ignition switch a few times when it will just
&gt; suddenly come back to life as if there was no problem. If this happens
while
&gt; I'm driving I can get the power back by using my light switch shocking
&gt; method. When I get the this problem while I'm still in the driveway I jump
&gt; out and start wiggling all the battery connections and starter wiring
&gt; connections (which all seem very solid and clean) but this never fixes the
&gt; problem like fidling with the light or ignition switch does which leads me
&gt; to believe their is a wiring problem somewhere else. I have even removed,
&gt; cleaned and replaced the large red wires connections going to the light
&gt; switch and fuse box and still no change in this problem.
&gt;  Over the last year I have replaced the battery, starter (bad solenoid),
the
&gt; positive battery cable connector, and since this problem has been showing
up
&gt; I recently upgraded to a new Bosch (internal regulator) alternator (which
&gt; did not fix the problem or change it in any other way).
&gt;
&gt; Please help I am completely losing my mind over this.
&gt;
&gt; Brett
