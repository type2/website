Subject: 2 Free Westies

From the Wetwesties list. I know nothing about these buses. Respond to
the advertiser:

 I am giving away 2 Westy's. 1968 and 1970. Free! You tow and get out
of my yard. I am not parting them out, you must take the whole thing!
There is enough to make 1 good bus. Please call me at 831-761-9398. On
Wednesday I will have the salvage yard tow them, but I will give Joe's
group first dibs. They are located in Watsonville, Ca.

Again, please do not call about parts.

CJ
