Subject: RE: Helium emissions would be too high to pass the smog test (friday)

&gt; Note: This option would not be practical in California
&gt; because your Helium emissions would be too high to
&gt; pass the smog test.

You must have test-driven this vehicle somewhere in Russia. I heard about an
area near Chernobyl where they don't really care about emissions ;-)
