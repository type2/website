Subject: Re: Weber 40DCNF carbs

My '76 2L had dual Solex that I replaced with a single two barrel
progressive Weber. I can tell that there is a big improvement in starting
and acceleration. Unfortunately, just before I did the swap the engine
dropped a valve seat and I haven't experienced the full difference between
the different carb setups. Engine is getting fixed this week.

Most everybody I talked to on the different web sites felt fuel injection
was a better application and I know from my 87 VW  fuel injected Golf that
it is very fast.

If I had a choice on my bus I'd like to see how it runs fuel injected.

&gt; Hi all Tooers
&gt; Recent joiner. Just bought a very nice 83 Westy with what appears to be
&gt; a dropped seat. I have a good 76 2.0 engine with 40 DCNF carbs and
&gt; assume it will fit with the 83 tin but will need a new exhaust system at
&gt; a horrific price. No Smog check here in FL so could use aftermarket
&gt; stuff but what about heat exchanger match up? Also, what is the
&gt; consensus about the Webers? I have 2 complete FI systems and can go
&gt; either way.
&gt; I have researched the archives and library but found little re the
&gt; Webers. All advise appreciated. Thanks, Jack- Rover SD1, 1960 Gemini FJ.
