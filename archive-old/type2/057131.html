I don't know :-(  I, too, have not been able to get on there and miss it
greatly.  I wrote to Marc (our most generous host) but have not gotten a
response.

I am thinking of proposing we all move to one of the public nets
(DALnet, IRCnet, etc.) and stake out a room of our own.  If anyone has any
thoughts on this, by all means let me know!  It would have to be an IRC
channel, as I am unable to use the other chat utilities, but am listening
to hear if anyone has a favorite among the different nets.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
