Subject: RE: [T2] Best 75-78 Exhaust?

I have had the best luck with an S&amp;S, thunderbird style header with a
replacement muffler.  Order the whole kit including the muffler from S&amp;S and
install it.  Take it down to your local muffler shop (Midas, etc..) and have
them cut the muffler off and replace it with a real muffler.  Make sure to
tell them that you want the muffler supported by steel strap to the header
and not with a rubber strap to the body.

I have used this type on dozens of cars with great luck.  The muffler will
outlast the header.  I have actually done this and had the muffler outlast
the engine.

&gt;I have a 1976 Bus that no longer has its stock exhaust.  It sounds like
&gt;getting all the stock parts will be next to impossible.  So, what is the
&gt;best way to go while still retaining my relatively new heater boxes?

&gt;I looked through the archives and found a lot of stories of quality
&gt;problems with the available aftermarket exhausts.  Plus, in many of the
&gt;catalogs and websites, they will refer to a &quot;Monza-style&quot; or extractor-type
&gt;exhaust but not identify the manufacturer.  Is there a way to tell who is
&gt;selling EMPI, Bugpack, S&amp;S, Pacesetter, etc.?

&gt;I'm looking for a good, durable exhaust (I'm prepared to sand and re-paint
&gt;with POR-20) that will sound good and provide decent flow when I replace
&gt;the current restrictive single 2 BBL Weber carb set-up.
