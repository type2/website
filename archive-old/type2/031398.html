Hey there,

Make sure you diagnose the problem fully before you go to this
extreame.  It is no picnic.

I did that job on my '78'.  It took me about 6 hours and made a big
mess.  It is better than removing the whole engine, unless you have other
work pending that requires an engine drop (clutch job, etc.) I don't think
the smog controls should add any difficulty to the task.

The most difficult problem I had was to get those seals to stay in
place.  Putting them on is like trying to get them to stay on a
wall...they just fall.  I use a tiny bit of gasket sealant to get them to
stay in place.  

A friend of mine had one hell of a time with his.  He got the gaskets
on..put it all back together..filled up the oil..started the engine.  Oil
began pouring out for the engine.  It turned out he had slightly crimped
one of the seals during installation.  Had to do the job all over again!

So be careful about those seals!

&gt;    I have question. Firt I have a 79 2.0L, FI, Calif Smog. I need to replace
&gt; the oil cooler seals as I believe they are leaking. I was wondering how hard
&gt; this job will be if I keep the motor in the bus. If anybody has done this
&gt; and/or anybody knows any tricks to make this job easier. Any information
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.
