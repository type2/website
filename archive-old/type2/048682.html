Subject: [T2] Christmas lights on bus

Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?  I would
love to install some this season and maybe put together a Christmas light
cruise.

I know I have seen semi's with multiple lights, but not really Christmas
lights.  I have attended one lighted Christmas parade, but the vehicles
were moving very slow, I would like to be able to drive highway speeds with
the lights on.

If you have any suggestions as to where to buy the lights (I heard there
are 12 volt ones made, but don't know where to get them), or how to install
them, please let me know.

Thank you.
