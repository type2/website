The smell of burnt oil fumes being pumped into the cab by the heater, and 
the slightly musty smell from winter moisture which hasn't had a chance 
to be dried by summer's heat all add to the, dare I say, ambience and 
'atmosphere' in a bus.
 
I suppose I took the smell of my '72 bus for granted until my brother got 
in it the other day. He currently drives a '76 2000l FI bus. 

He said the smell of my bus reminded him of his earlier baywindow busses. 

I guess the 2000l FI engine doesn't smell as much.

I wonder do campers have cooking smells? You know, hot cooking oil, burnt 
eggs, bacon and such.
