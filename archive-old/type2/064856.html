&gt;Are you sure this is why they rejected the story? If so, then,
&gt;yes, that is pretty fucking lame of them ('scuse me). If not,
&gt;that's still pretty weird -- I seem to remember you were lined
&gt;up for this months &amp; months ago???

Ya know what? The manuscript wasn't even read! Call me
anal - but the way it was presented to them made it easy to
see that it hadn't even been opened! Although the photo
submission had been opened - and - shucks, no tits!

Under the advice of the professional photographer who
helped with the photo shoot, I called Simurda (the editor -
who positively responded to my query letter) and asked him
if he wasn't going to use the story OR photographs would
he please return them... in the self addressed, stamped
envelope I had enclosed? He acted really dumb... and said 
 &quot;Ummmmm....... I think it's around here somewhere.... 
It's probably filed somewhere... er.. umm.. I'll try to
find it and either run it next month or send it back to you.&quot;

This was SIX MONTHS after her had received it. It was
back in my hands the week after the phone call... Like I
said, UNREAD and UNPUBLISHED!

It did sorta torque my jaws!

Thanks for the info on the UK mag.
