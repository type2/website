Subject: Followup: [T2] Help Please, I failed my emissions test

Hi,

Ok, so a quick compression test reveals the following:
1 -&gt; 115
2 -&gt; 115
3 -&gt; 110
4 -&gt; 125

Now the book (idiot's guide) says that the values should be within 5 points of
each other. Should I worry about number 4?

Also, the plugs were very carbon fouled. So, as Richard suggested, I'll work
with the emissions tester to get the fuel mix down to 2% CO.

The other question that I have is will a exhaust leak (I have one) have any
bearing on the results of my emissions test?


Thanks,
Harry


Quoting Tom Young &lt;tomyoung1_at_comcast_dot_net&gt;:

*&gt; If you really want to do this right, then it's time for a compression check
*&gt; and a complete tune-up: all hoses and connections inpected and any vacuum
*&gt; leaks eliminated, all components of ignition tested and brought up to snuff,
*&gt; then the FI components tested and adjusted or replaced as necessary.
