Subject: Re: Oil Gallery Plug Repair

&gt;I then notice sitting on one of the shelves on the engine case, a distorted
&gt;piece of aluminum, roundish in shape and obviously chewed up.
&gt;I then look closer at the case, below the center line of the case are three
&gt;round plug-looking places and the mishapen piece of metal has blown out of
&gt;one of these.

Here's a re-run of a Hoover sermon that (I think!) addresses your problem.


		Oil Gallery Plug Repair

Based on your description your engine appears to have blown-out the plug
sealing one of the main oil galleries to your cam-followers.   Oversize plugs
are available but chances are you won't be able to find them locally.   The
only truly reliable alternative is to thread the bore to accept a set-screw of
suitable diameter and install it with loctite.   Unfortunately, tapping the
thread
will contaminate an extremely critical portion of your engine with the metal
particles produced by the tapping operation.

The usual field repair in such a case is to provide a pressurized source of
lubricant to the oil gallery and to do the tapping while the lubricant is
flooding
from the open bore, carrying with it (hopefully!) all of the swarf produced by
the tapping operation.   Once tapped, the lubricant must be drained and all
oil removed from the threads.   The bore and set-screw are then primed and
installed with loctite or similar sealant.

The lubricant need not be under high pressure, only sufficient to insure a
positive flow through the bore inorder to carry away the swarf.   Spent lubri-
cant can not be reused, however, since you must consider it to be contami-
nated with metal particles.   You must weigh the mess, preparation and cost
of the gallon or two of oil against the alternative - tearing down the engine
- or the less positive repair procedure described below.

The usual method of setting-up for this job (which also applies to the earlier
engines) is to introduced the pressured supply of oil at the oil pressure
sensor.   Being downstream from the oil-pressure control valve, you can get
a good flow with only a few pounds of pressure.   (If you introduce the flow
upstream from the oil-pressure control valve you would have to overcome
the tension of the valve's spring, typically 28 to 45 psi, depending on the
engine.   The lower the pressure you must work with, the better off you are.)
There are a number of methods of providing a pressurized source of lubri-
cant but for low pressures the handiest means is to modify a tank-type gar-
den sprayer by installing a suitable fixture in the sprayer's hose.   (This is
how you 'pre-lube' a newly assembled engine before running it for the first
time.)

Understand, this method introduces oil THROUGHOUT the engine - you
will very quickly fill up the crankcase.   If you're careful to stop
tapping and let
the threads flush, you may drain the crankcase as many times as necessary
during this process.   Oil from the sump may be used in the pressure bottle
but any oil coming from the threaded bore must be thrown away.

However, since you have the old plug there is a somewhat riskier but less
messy procedure that may result in an effective and reliable repair.  That is
to knurl the plug so as to increase it's outside diameter, clean the bore,
removing all trace of oil, treat the bore and plug with loctite, and drive the
thing back in.  Once in place, it should be straked, then allowed to stand for
24 hours for the sealant to harden.

This type of knurling can be easily accomplished using the procedure de-
scribed in one of my articles on fire prevention.  The procedure calls for
roll-
ing the plug on a board using a mill-cut file.  A light amount of pressure on
the file will emboss (or knurl) the plug.  The metal raised by the knurling
process effectively increases the diameter of the plug - hopefully enough
to make it a tight fit in the bore.  But since this type of hand-knurling pro-
duces linear channels, the thing will still leak unless a suitable sealant is
used and allowed to properly cure.

Straking simply means displacing metal with a punch.  To strake a plug in
the bore you make a series of center-punch marks around the periphery of
the bore.  The displacement of the metal of the crankcase toward the plug
will serve to lock it in place... but only against a moderate amount of
internal
pressure.  Since the gallery will see up to 70 psi, and since the plug has
appreciable surface area, the straking alone is not sufficient to insure the
thing will stay tight and leak-free.  You need to use all three of the proce-
dures - knurling, hardening sealant, and straking - to give you the bests
odds of success.
