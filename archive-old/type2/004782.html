Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring VDO Cylinder Head temp.


&gt;I just purchased and *almost* installed a VDO cylender head temp gauge.
&gt;I am assuming that this gauge isnt nuclear powered and will require
&gt;power.
&gt;So how does this bubba hook up?

As a matter of fact, it is nuclear powered. Seriously, I don't know what
powers it, but no 12 volt power is required.
VDO has a website with instructions for all their gauges.
