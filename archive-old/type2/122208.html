Subject: Compression check &amp; Valve adjustment

OK, I took the  heads off my '72 1.7 liter engine.

After a bit of head work, I buttoned it all back up and just did a 
compression check.  I  got 1 - 110; 2 - 105; 3 - 90; 4 - 110.  [I am going 
to buy a better compression checker, so I can get a better reading.]

If I now re-adjust the valves and do another compression check, should I 
expect to see different  [better] values??

After all, the valves WERE adjusted before I took the heads off and pulled 
the valves and bead blasted the heads and lapped the valves and swapped out 
a pair of exhaust valves and put on new head gaskets....  But that shouldn't 
matter, right?!?!?!
