Subject: fuel pump

Our bus had a problem were it would run but would stall out under the 
slightest load.  I though it was the fuel pump because it went from 
being quite noisy to silence.  I put in a new fuel pump but still hear 
nothing.  Also, there are two terminals on the fuel pump, I have the red 
wire on the passenger side terminal and the brown on the drivers side,  
Is this right?
Jon
