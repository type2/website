Subject: Re: Weird Brake Happenings ('74)

Hi all
After reading Jonathan's post I got to thinking about the 
little amount of time I have actually drivin my bus. I noticed
that when I put on the brakes with the clutch in, the idle
increases. I thought this was normal but now I don't know.
Is this normal??????
