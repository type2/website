&gt;Chris' definition that deadhead stickers have to do with a busses
&gt;impending death, the more, the closer to death, is simply wrong.  
&gt;

Jeff's definition, though seemingly informed, is not consistent with the pop
culture definition, which I will elaborate heretofore:

&quot;Deadhead&quot; is a slang used for the once prolific garciasaurus, which during
the Jurassic period was predominantly found in the northwestern US. Though
estimated at something over 100 feet tall, the only part of the garciasaurus
that has been unearthed to date is the head, thus leading to the nickname
&quot;deadhead.&quot;

Native Americans carried forward legend of the deadhead's song, which has
been incorporated into some modern music. Some people say that you must be
in an altered state, natural or naturally induced, in order to absorb the
true source of harmony with all being that emerges from the song of the
garciasaurus, though there is, in my mind, significant evidence that this is
not true.

The stickers symbolize oneness with all living things. The phrase &quot;deadhead
sticker on a cadillac&quot; is antithetic. VWs were, especially during the late
60s, seen as harmonious vehicles, where the cadillac is the penultimate
symbol of the industrialist notion that all things must serve man and that
man's comfort is the foremost consideration.

...either that, or it may be referring to one of those &quot;Grateful Dead&quot;
stickers with the skull that you so often see on splitties and loafs.
...Naaaaaaaaahhh. ;) Joe
