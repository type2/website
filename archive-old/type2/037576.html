That may go back to me in September of last year where I was hearing 
the same thing you are, even down to stethoscope on the fuel pump, 
etc., and suspected the gear coming loose from the camshaft.
Turned out the camshaft and gear were still very tight to each other.
The noise was camshaft bearings !
