My PO put a Franz oil filter on my motor, and I have to say it appears to
have done a great job so far.  The sump is spotless when I change the oil.
But, this is the type that uses a roll of toilet paper for the filter
element.  So...I've got a collection of oil saturated toilet paper rolls
accumulating.  I don't like it.  Does anyone know of an off the shelf remote
filter kit that will go on the hoses to my can?  Or recommend a remote kit
(including it's own hoses/fittings) that will replace my set?
