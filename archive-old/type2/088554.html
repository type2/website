Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot

It's tough to get reliable responses to &quot;is my oil too hot&quot; questions since
everybody drives with a different style, over varying terrains, using
different temp sensors located at different places on the engine.  The
closest &quot;universal&quot; test is the old &quot;dipstick&quot; test.  After a run go back
and pull the dipstick.  If it's too hot to handle, or you can just barely
handle it, then your oil is too hot.  By reference I can drive my '81 at
freeway speeds (65-70) for several hours and then *easily* handle the
dipstick - it's barely warm.

A rebuilt engine will probably run a little hotter than an engine that's
well broken in, so slightly higher temps on a new rebuild should be
expected.

If you did a comprehensive rebuild (including bottom end) then you shouldn't
be getting an oil light flicker at idle after 20 minutes, assuming your
sensor is OK.  Maybe first put a mechanical sensor on the engine and read
oil pressure from there.

&gt; I am new to this list, I have just gotten a 80
&gt; Westy(air cooled)- rebuilt the engine(2.0L), it seems
&gt; to be running a little hot, not knowing what it should
&gt; be thought I would ask. temp after a 20 mile run is
&gt; 245 F., the oil light flickers at idle. I have not
&gt; checked the pressure yet. Phil
