Subject: RE: [T2] auto tranny

&quot;Sorry for the moment but it was mine.&quot;

James,
Although this is not helping the Listee that is looking for the auto tranny, 
I agree. I used to know a guy who had a bunch of Buses with no tranny for 
the very same reason. Yes he had a lot of Buggie friends. I second your 
&quot;Ick&quot;. Can't they build those with Honda Trannies?

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
