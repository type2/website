Brennan,

I am not sure what you are getting from the bus depot. The '72-'74 stock
system would consist of the heat exchangers (one piece), connecting pipes (4
two forward and two aft), muffler, tailpipe and gasket installation set.
There are 4 copper oval gaskets to mate the exchanger to the head. There are
2 trapezoidal gaskets to mate the exchangers to the muffler and a triangular
gasket to mate the tail pipe to the muffler. Also some new copper self
locking nuts are needed to bolt it all up. The four pipes are different than
you stock system The flapper boxes (valves) will do fine.

I have a 1978 champagne edition westy w/ very bad exhaust.  I am going to
convert to the 72-75 stock system.  I already have the heat exchangers and
some sort of valves (black and look like elbows w/ a vent thing on one end)
I have the stock system coming from bus depot.

Do I need anything else?  gaskets, tubing, bolts, anything?

Thanks for your help...also will this system and the heat exchangers bolt
right into my stock 78 engine, or will any modifications need to be made?

Thanks again.

Brennan
