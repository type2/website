I just joined the 100  mile tow club at AAA.  I signed my daughte up as a
partnes, a second account.

YOU DONT NEE your AAA card to get roadside assistance, or even remember your
member number.  Just call 1-800 AAA HELP and they will be glad to find you
in the system, and get the tow truck to you.

The two times I used the AAA tow, the tow operator did not ask to see my AAA
card.

So if IRC, even if you are with a driver who is is NOT and AAA member, you
can still get roadside service for that vehicle.

What, no body talked about a 6mm hex key to undo/redo the alternetor bolt
when you break your alt belt??
