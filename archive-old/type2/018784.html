&gt; She has a pop-top, but it goes straight up like a Sportsmobile.  Unlike a

&gt; This is/was a Canadian bus.

Rob &amp; list,

I recently hauled a '67 Kombi with this &quot;Hanover Mfg. Co.&quot; conversion
down from Vancouver Island. While the bus is pretty rusty, I will
attempt to put her back together. There is a home-built, rather
butchered interior which I am sure is not original. 

I would be interested to know if this firm is still alive and if there
are any other owners of this unusual conversion on either t-2 or vintage
lists. The conversion was done to a non-sunroof bus by cutting out most
of the top from b-pillar to the last cross-brace. The resulting hole was
then reinforced with heavy angle iron and the lift mechanism and top
attaches to this. It gives about 6'-4&quot; of clear standing room in the
bus, plus a large top bunk, possibly the only bunk.
