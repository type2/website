Hi Volks,

I won't mix in... I won't mix in... I won't mix in... I tried.  Lord 
knows I tried.  And I failed, predictably.  ;-)

Cut the bashing, everyone.  Please.  Pretty pretty please.  It 
frankly does not matter if someone is rude in their p-mail, if 
someone is worthy of being a subscriber, or God knows what 
accusations and so-called opinions else we were forced to read these 
days.  This is not the place to discuss it.  And in doing so, harm 
enough was caused to drive people off the list.  If I'm any 
indication, many are seriously considering signing off right now.

If we don't stop this now, we're more than likely to destroy this 
resource.  And it will be everyone's fault.  So I urge everybody on 
here: grind your teeth, swallow your pride, open your eyes, and stop 
it now.  I'd hate to see this thing die just because of a bunch of 
individuals too self-absorbed to take flame and personal insult 
off-list where they belong.

Feel free to flame me - every message will be read and answered.  I'm 
looking forward to discussing this with you.  But please do it off-list.

I never thought the day would come where I'd miss a &quot;Please kill this 
thread&quot; message from Ken.  How could it get so bad this fast?  :-(

Obligatory bus content: thanks for mentioning www.bulli_dot_org on the 
links list, but the Community of Interest T2 will reside under 
www.bulli_dot_org/t2ig/, where useful content is scheduled to appear 
later this week.  

Peace, everybody.  Read a digest from two weeks ago, compare it to 
the latest one, and decide which you liked better.

Yours,
    Erik.
