The only time I've ever seen one was in a movie.  There were these 3 people
in the front, who were smuggling soldiers through some middle eastern country.
It was a double cab with a tent, and there were about 15 soldiers in the back.
The part of the movie that had the truck showed the truck well, from all angles
inside and out.  It was cool.  I don't know what the movie was but it was 
cool.

I did not know VW covered wagons existed before that!
