Subject: Generator help! (bit long).


my gen. had been making a new &quot;whirling&quot; sound for a
couple weeks tht was audible when driving around town.

my gen light came on bright the other night--all at
once. And the whirling sound seemed to be gone.

Belt was adjusted right. Eninge Not hot. Checked all
the wires and they appear fine. gen and regulator seem
grounded fine.

read muir, bentley and stuff in vw library. did some
primitive diagnositics. Hooked up a voltmeter between
the B+ and ground (a la bentley). NO voltage, even at
high rpms. Pushed on brushes etc. 

took off belt reached around to the fan nut and tried
to wiggle the generator/fan shaft. Miniscule movement
(i expected a lot more if the bearings had gone out).
Brushes seem to be in contact and are only about 1/3
worn. Gen make a healthy sound and spins freely by
hand. (Makes a clicking sound when it goes
counter-clockwise.

QUESTION: I had hoped to get away with new bearings
and brushes. But if i have so little play, i'm
guessing there something more serious wrong in the
generator--our with my diagnostics.

Any help appreciated. It's not the $ of a new
generator, it's just that I'd hate to go through the
time and pain of putting it in, just to find out it's
something else.

Any help appreciated.
