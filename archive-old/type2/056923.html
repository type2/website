John, I'm sure you'll get lots of good advice from the more experienced, but
one thing that caught my eye on the Weber adjust, was the # of turns on the
mixture screw. The Weber tweak sheet (we have the same carb on a 78 and a 77
engine) calls for setting idle at 1000 RPM's, closing mixture adjustment til
you get a 50 RPM dropoff, opening it 1/4 turn, and then resetting to spec
idle (850-950?). Works great on ours..one with a 009 and one with a vac
dizzy. Regards, Marv Krupp 78 loaf/72 hightop/74 camper(77 eng) whose brakes
are going to be 4.0 this week, thanks to Karl /63 1500S
