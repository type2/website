Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is now water-cooled.

Sorry to hear about that Greg, 
 
I to sat road side this weekend with just over 1000 miles on the wife's 72  
westy. We suffered a blown clutch / tranny, something gave way. There was no  
slipping no shifting problems it acted like 2 other clutch problems with 2 
other  72 buses I worked on. this seems to be common with them.
 
The wife wants her new daily driver....guess I know what work I'm doing at  
the shop today...lol
