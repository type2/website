Howdy,

I've been lurking a while to settle in but feel at home enough now to start
asking the odd question.

Searched the Library and archives but couldn't find an answer to my
specific question, so here goes!

Disregarding the varying emission (smog) regulations which seem to vary
from state to state over there in the US (I'm British based!), can anyone
tell me what a *healthy*  CO reading should be on a stock t/p 1600 _at_ 800
rpm.

I can find many sources quoting upper limits as far as the passing of
various Govt. tests is concerned and indeed methods of attaining those
levels but, as we all know, what's good for the Govt (and probably our own
lungs!) is not necessarily automatically healthy for a VW engine.

In the UK we are fortunate enough that smog emission legislation was
introduced later than in much of the US and was not retrospective;
therefore, virtually all aircooled VW's escape scrutinization and I have
the freedom to tune my bus as suits HER rather than other folks.
So, without any intention of harming others, anyone know what would be a
good healthy (not so lean as my valves won't last the winter) readout
percentage on the gas anylyser??

Cheers in anticipation,
