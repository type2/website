Subject: Re: [T2] dual carbs to single.

&gt; The carb on an engine is used to vaporize fuel...
&gt; The longer the manifold, (that is, the
&gt; furthur the gas has to travel) the better the chances of it starting to
turn
&gt; back to a liquid.

I'm confused.  I thought the manifold further vaporized fuel, not
recondensed it.  Isn't that why there's a heat riser tube, so the manifold
is nice and hot to vaporize gas?
Do you not need reat risers on a dual-carb motor because the manifolds are
so close to the heads, and therefore hot?
I live in the cold and high, and I'm thinking about Kadrons for my 1600DP,
so I'd appreciate any insight on their winter (or all around) performance.
TIA.
