&gt; This is how things happen now on my 77 with fuel injection.
&gt;
&gt; It runs as it should when its cold. A little lumpy. This doesn't last long
&gt; at all a couple minutes. I expect this, I removed the cold start hardware.
&gt; After this smoothes out it runs nice and strong. I get out on the interstate
&gt; and runt it at 70 for 3 -4 miles and I start to feel the surging issue
&gt; again. It feels like its got a cylinder dropping out at random. Its hard to
&gt; describe but the best I can do is say that it comes and goes ( the surges )
&gt; every second to second and a half. Theres no pattern or certain cadence to
&gt; the surges and seem to be at random. This will hast for another mile or two
&gt; and then it stays running rough after that. No more surges just run rough
&gt; now. Sounds like a lawnmower. I can park it and let it cool for an hour or
&gt; so and then hop in it then the same story as I stated above all over again.
&gt; Starts out strong, somewhere in the middle there is a transitionary phase
&gt; between running good and running crappy and it cant make its mid up what it
&gt; wants to do, and then finally it runs crappy until I shut it off and let it
&gt; cool down.

I had a similar problem and it turned out to be a tiny hole in the
diaphram in the vacuum timing advance unit.  when it gets hot take a spare
piece of tubing and put it on the vacuum advance unit and suck on it and
see if it holds the vacuum, also make sure the plate inside the
distributor with the points on it moves when you suck on it, it doesn't
move much but it must move....


&gt; What the surging issue feels like to me is an ignition issue ( could be
&gt; wrong ). It feels like one cylinder is coming and going. I'm new to these
&gt; volkie engines so all I have to go off of are v6's and v8's and rotarys.
&gt;
also you might want to check for loose wire connections they can drive you
nuts and we have all probably had our share.
