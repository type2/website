Subject: Re: Argh ... type2_dot_com is now frames only

&gt;&quot;Sorry, this site now requires a frames-capable browser&quot;

&gt;I hope the webpage-keepers will rethink their decision to obsolete us
&gt;unix-users.

I'd like to code a no-frames alternative and also a text-only version, I
don't have a lot of time lately and am more interested in getting
everything working, all offers of help gleefully considered.

Please check out the new interface and send me your comments off-list. I'm
especially interested in how you think it flows, how it could be more
intuitive, whether the categories on the left are appropriate and
self-explanatory, etc.
