Subject: Re: Oil cooler lines

&gt; I'm about to mount an additional oil cooler on my 1983 Air Cooled
&gt; 2000cc. I'm using a sandwich type filter adapter and a stock (standard
&gt; cooler for the 2000cc) additional VW cooler.
&gt; I'd like to put it forward of the rear axles under the van for plenty of
&gt; air flow and was just wondering about the distance that I can run the
&gt; cooler lines...

Go for it. That's just how I did it on my '78 bus. It's probably about 4.5
feet one way to the aux cooler, 9 foot round trip. I still have 60psi+
pressure when running, as measured by the sensor immediately after this
loop. It's been in place for 7 years with no real problems and much cooler
engine operating temps as a result.

Have fun,
