Subject: [type2] How much Vinyl for back of 72 westy?

Hi All,

I tried to find the answer to this question in the
archives but couldn't (I'm sure it's there, just don't
have hours to look for it)

My question: How many yards (approx 5' wide) of vinyl
fabric do I need to re-cover the back of a 72 Westy?
(there is the rear facing seat as in late 60's
Westies).  If any one has an approx. answer that's
fine.  

I tend to buy way too much if I'm unsure. So if all
any one has is a ballpark fiqure that's great.

Thanks a ton!

Rae
72 Westy with 76 drive train (and soon new seat
covers!!)
