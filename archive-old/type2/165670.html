&gt; Here in Tucson there's some old common wisdom that says you're  
&gt; better off without the flaps.  I think it's hogwash, but  
&gt; practically all the old timers at the VW parts shops told me over  
&gt; and over again that in Tucson you just don't need the thermostat or  
&gt; flaps.

What a coincidence that they don't recommend parts they don't sell.  
Sheesh.

&gt; After installing them the warmup time has improved dramatically.   
&gt; It used to be that the thing positively wouldn't warm up (this was  
&gt; in the winter-time, mind you) just idling; it had to be driven a  
&gt; couple of miles (and those miles were a pain in the neck).  Now, a  
&gt; couple minutes of idling in the driveway is all it takes.  The  
&gt; difference is impressive.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, when the outside temps are in the triple digits all day  
&gt; and the high 80s all night the system won't do me any good, but it  
&gt; also won't do any harm.  I mostly want the flaps installed for when  
&gt; the weather is cool.

It's still working. The thermostat doesn't open until 85-90C  
(185-194F). When the engine is &quot;cold&quot; it's still 100F below  
thermostat opening temp.

Don said the flaps are a must on the Type 4 engine. He couldn't be  
more right:

Without that flap, the air just blows right on by and the oil temps  
go nuts.
