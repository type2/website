Subject: Re: [T2] Soft Brakes?

&gt;The pros are right - the rear brakes need to be adjusted to prevent the 
&gt;condition you describe.  It took me many years of bus-driving (pre 
&gt;type2-list) to figure this out.  My rear brakes seem to need tightening 
&gt;every few months to prevent the soft pedal syndrome, and it's a real 
&gt;annoyance.  One day I'm going to figure out how to install auto-adjusting 
&gt;drums on the rear.
&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing you probably haven't been tightening your rear brakes every 
&gt;few months.  If not, and if you are missing any of those black plastic 
&gt;plugs in the shield, your adjusting stars are likely frozen and may 
&gt;require disassembly and maintenance before you can adjust the brakes and 
&gt;firm up your pedal.  That has been my experience anyway.

Wouldn't Vanagon drums do the job (I mean the self adjusting gig?)

Amazing that as late as the end of the 70's a mainstream car manufacturer 
was putting non-self adjusting brakes on a mid-priced vehicle. Especially 
on a &quot;deluxe&quot; vehicle like some of the Westfalias that were equal in cost 
to a Volvo.

Anyone made any progress towards rear disc brakes? I know there was one 
fellow that had done it on a Vanagon .

I'd like to have vented front disc to while I'm dreaming.
