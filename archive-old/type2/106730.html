Subject: Re: [T2] Dumb Guy needs help

Makes perfect sense-they only torque to like 5lbs
the only stud thats a bear to replace is the one that also holds the oil
pickup tube down, the rest can be replaced with step studs. Just be careful
to clean well after you tap it oversize (use heavy grease on the opposite
side to catch the shaveings)

&gt; While doing an oil change this weekend on my 70 westy, I somehow stripped
one
&gt; of those 6 studs that hold that plate that covers the oil screen. &gt;
