Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Lawrence

Just a miny Buskatiers event at the Free State Brewery.  You are in the area
of many Buskatiers, so watch out, you may get a very large dose of friendly
bus people, we do have a good time with our busses!!  In the area of
Lawrence there are over 40 busses that belong to Buskatiers, you should be
one.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I'm in Lawrence, KS on business and today I'm seeing a larger than usual
&gt; number of Buses around.  We've got an orange and white late bay in front of
&gt; the Free State brewpub, a grey/primer split across the street in front of the
&gt; candle shop and I just saw a blue early bay Westy come out of the parking lot
&gt; behind the Eldridge hotel.  Some sort of Bus event I didn't know about?
&gt; Anyone on the list?
&gt; 
&gt; This seems an unusual concentration of Buses for a one-block area :-)
