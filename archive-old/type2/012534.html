&gt;might prove real useful for getting light into tight spaces and/or 
&gt;aiming it at specific spots. You just slip it over the flashlight 
&gt;lens, you can get either a 6 or 20 inch length of fiber optic

I noticed these same things last week in of all places, Walmart.
So I bought one.  Not great, not bad.  It was like $5 (the 6&quot; one)
