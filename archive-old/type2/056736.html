The third annual VW-van lists/LiMBO drive in night will be held on
Saturday, August 8 at the Rustic Drive-in on RT 146 in Smithfield RI (20
minutes north of Providence RI...and just north of the 146 &amp; I-295
junction). Last year we had approx 25 VW vans.

The Rustic is a three screen drive-in, so there should be something showing
for every taste. The Rustic does not post its movies until the middle of
the week, so please do not ask, e-mail, etc. what will be showing that
night...I will post the information during the days prior to the event.

Hope to see you there!

Ric
