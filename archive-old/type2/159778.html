&gt; folks, gotta friend with a bad zamboni. It has a good

&gt; cleared almost the whole ice and then 10' from the
&gt; gate started to sputter and finally die at the gate.
&gt; it idles ok, but as soon as it gets gas, it dies.
&gt; Kaput. it will run with any one plug wire removed,
&gt; othre than #3. when #3 is out, it dies. 

Sounds to me like it could perhaps be a fouled plug or something wrong 
with the distributor cap. I.E. not a very good spark at all but #3 plug. 
It's also possible there is something more major like burnt valves or 
something wrong with a head. If new plugs don't work out, I would 
consider doing a quick compression test to verify the engine is 
mechanically correct.
