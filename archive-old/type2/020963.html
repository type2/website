&gt; Another Vanagon question (can you tell the weather was nice here??)
&gt;
&gt; The Vanagon is stumbling and missing under load, but it idles nicely and
&gt; has pickup until about 2600 RPM. If this was a *real* van (like my '71)
&gt; I would suspect points or condenser. But, the Vanagon has a Hall
&gt; distributor. Plugs, wires, cap and rotor all look OK, clean under the cap,
&gt; rotor checks out on the multimeter. Coil checks out but is marginal.
&gt; Would a bad coil cause this kind of stumble?

Chris:
Possibly weak spark, coil or wires. I'd rather expect fuel delivery, probably
fuel filter, pump, or possibly fuel pump pushrod.(This often happened in 72-74
wiht dual carbs and mechanical pump.)
