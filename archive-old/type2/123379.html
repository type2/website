Subject: Re: [T2] Van will start...20 seconds later it dies by
  itself?????

My '78 FI bus would start, run like a top for 3 seconds, then die.  It would 
not re-start for a few hours, but when it did, it would do the exact same 
thing.  I replaced the air flow meter to no avail.  It turned out to be a 
broken spring on an intake valve.  Or was it exhaust?  I slept since then, 
but a quick peek at your valves should tell you if that was the problem.  My 
spring was broken in two different places, and came out in 3 pieces.


&gt; &gt;She starts.  I step on the accelerator to let her warm up and then
&gt; &gt;the engine dies on its own from 2000 rpm to 0 in 5 secs.  Eventually
&gt; &gt;the engine will start again and run fine until unpredictably the
&gt; &gt;problems occurs again.
