Subject: RE: [T2] Air Conditioning???

&gt;Ive wondered if it would be possible to use copper pipe for the long
&gt;fore/aft run and put some flexible hoses with fittings where needed.
&gt;Even I have a little A/C on the brain.


I think it might be a challenge to get the fittings attatched to the pipe, 
but other than that I think the idea is a sound one.
