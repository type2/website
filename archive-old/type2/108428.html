Subject: Fw: [T2] Update On Alice's Maiden Voyage

You have to unbolt the steering column from the steering box to find these
connections. They are mucho hidden. Remove the 13mm nut from the cross bolt
holding the flange onto the steering box shaft, then pop the steering column
up off the shaft. To do this, you will need to unscrew and unbolt several
screws holding the column to the dashboard, and don't lose any of the
plastic coated washers, plus remember where they came from.  You have to
nylon tie strap the upper column to the dash, so the wires don't get ripped
out when the column leans over. At the bottom of the column, there is a male
tab, and there is a little cutaway in the body facing forward. When you push
the wire hiding under the column onto this tab, there is a little trick to
it, you have to hold it near the cutaway and push the column forward into
it. Then, put the flange back onto the steering box, and line up the groove
on the box shaft with the hole the bolt goes through. Use a new M8 nylok nut
here, you sure don't want this nut falling off. Good time to clean up the
ring connector that comes down through the column and goes around one of the
steering coupler bolts. Replace the coupler if it needs it.

ps  There may be an easier way to do this, if so someone please pipe up.
