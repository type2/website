&gt; &gt; Don't know if it is true or not.  But supposedly if you change the design
&gt; &gt; (ever so slightly) you should be safe :)
&gt; &gt; Any one know if this is true?
&gt;
&gt; There's no &quot;10% change&quot; rule in US copyright law.  There's a misconception
&gt; that you can change something a little and it's not a violation of the
&gt; copyright.  The law is written so that it's pretty much up to the perception
&gt; of the copyright owner whether or not you've violated their property right
&gt; to the copyrighted item.
&gt;
&gt; If they think you've violated their copyright, you have until otherwise
&gt; proven in court.  And since most jealously guarded copyrights have wealthy
&gt; owners behind them (along with well-paid lawyers), you stand very little
&gt; chance of winning a case against them.

if that isn't right. just locally we had a Phillipine woman that had an
asian restaurant, here name was &quot;Sony Florendo&quot;  her restaurant had been
Sony's Restaurant for over 20 years when the TV giant decided they somehow
had their copyrighted name offended and sued this woman.

she did not have the resources to fight them and they very generously gave
her a year to phase in a new name....

next time in Baltimore stop in at &quot;Florendo's Restaurant&quot;
Bus content, she thinks the buses are really neat and are invited to park
right in front
