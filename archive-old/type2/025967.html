&gt; 1) Rather than take 2 heads, I'd take 1 head and a spare piston and rings.
&gt; If you drop a valve it's quite possible that the cylinder and connecting rod
&gt; will be semi-ok, but the piston will be toast! (Ask me how I know). Also
&gt; I've had a piston split in 2 about 15,000 miles after a rebuild! ( I assume
&gt; the piston was flawed to begin with). In both of these cases a spare piston
&gt; will see you through.

I'd take two piston/cylinder/ring sets, and at least one connecting rod.
That's how they come, and if you need to change a piston, it's no more
trouble to put on a new cylinder than to reinstall the old one.
