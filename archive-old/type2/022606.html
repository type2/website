I've just ended a minor battle trying to get my '76 bus to start.  The problem
first developed two weeks ago.  The starter was turning over but very weakly,
then nothing.  The battery was obviously old, and it tested low so I replaced
it.  Then everything was fine for about a day.  Next, the starter sounded
great, the engine turned over merrily but it would not start.  Finally, by
running a substitute I determined that the wire from the distributor to the
ignition switch was bad, so I replaced it and now it starts up just fine.
During these two weeks, I went over miles of wires and replaced tons of
connectors, and tested the fuel pump relay several times.  Somewhere along the
line I noticed that when I turn the key to &quot;on&quot; before I start it the fuel
pump comes on.  I can hear it, and I don't remember ever hearing it before it
seems to be loud enough that I would have noticed it at least with the windows
open in the summer.  I tested the pressure in the ring main (didn't disconnect
the vacuum line) and ran the starter and the pressure was about 36.  So my
question is, is the fuel pump supposed to come on before the starter is
activated?  From what I've read I don't believe it is.  If it's not what do I
do? Can I drive it, or will it continue building up fuel pressure until it
explodes or something?  I've followed the procedures for trouble shooting FI
on the type2 home page, and it seems to check out, but it hasn't been as easy
to do as it seemed.
Thanks,
