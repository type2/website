Hi Rick,

10 seconds and a dollars grease for extra protection does not seem like a
waste to me.  With the Valvo-Moly and mild hub packing it simply keeps the
needles constantly greased under any condition. I like that.  I don't mind
thoroughly cleaning at repack time.  Those who experience grease exiting the
seal or cap can be sure the job was not done right in the first place.  It
also means that water can enter the hub, which I have also seen on countless
occasion.

In a completely, air tight, sealed industrial use I agree with you 100%.

Those poor neglected rear bearings...agree with you there as well.

Coating the inside of the hub would be fine for rust prevention, but packing
the inside is a waste of time and money, you are going to have to clean all
that back out to clean all the small particles that could re-enter the
bearing causing damage.
