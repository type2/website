&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anybody know of a good, reasonably priced source for micrometers?
&gt;
&gt;I got an NSK at Snap-On about five years ago for about fifty dollars.
&gt;Beautiful piece of work. It's probably the best tool I own. &quot;Dial Caliper,&quot;
&gt;it calls itself, measures both ID and OD. Moves smooth as glass.
&gt;
        Probably not as accurate as a micrometer, but it's likely good
enough for VW work. A micrometer *should* be a highly accruate (+/- .001&quot;)
instrument, while a Caliper will likely have a slightly looser tolerance
(+/- .002-.005&quot; or more, depending on the qualitly of the manufacturer).

Peace,
