&gt; I consider myself very fortunate (thanks Tobin!) to have acquired a
&gt; BA-6 Eberspacher gas heater, albeit with a few missing parts and in
&gt; unknown operating condition.  Since these things were regularly installed
&gt; in Canadian-bound type 2s, I've tried to locate parts and service stations
&gt; in Canada to no avail.  JB's got a few parts in Castle Rock, CO but he's
&gt; much more into the Stewart Warner burners.


In case anyone is interested, this was one of my finds in Europe - one brand
new, never-installed BA6 gas heater.  Alas, it is not fully complete.  Not
included are the combustion air blower (available for about $175 if you
wanted a new one), the temp sensor that mounts underneath the front cabin
area, and the underdash relays and dash switch.  Present is the heater body
itself, with the other ancilliary parts attached, and the wiring harness.  I
suspect that the blower was robbed from it many years ago to repair another
unit when it was on the dealer's parts shelf; the other ancilliary parts
probably were sold separately in the first place. If you had a used BA6 to
rob the minor parts off of, you would be able to install under your bus
perhaps the last remaining brand-new BA6 gas heater.  The price is $349,
as-is. Warning: installing a gasoline heater is a relatively difficult job
and is done at your own risk.  The heater will be here in about 10 days as
part of my shipment of parts from Europe.
