&gt; I have a 1979 2litre with twin carbs. (CJ engine)

&gt; I replaced the left hand head with a complete new head a couple of weeks ago
&gt; 
&gt; Since then the engine has been running hot.  You don't notice this on short

did you get that rod that controls the cooling flaps back under the tin
correctly if not right it will jam (ask me how I know)

&gt; I have checked all the tinware, fans, valve clearances, plugs, ignition
&gt; timing etc and it is all spot on, also the fuel economy is best it has been.

the better fuel mileage could be a sign that you are running lean.  did
you disturb the timing or carb settings

&gt; Could the new head be the wrong type?  Someone told me that because my 79
&gt; Heat exchangers fitted it must be the correct head.

I think the only differences in the 2L heads are weather or not you have
hyl lifters and I am not sure there

&gt; Could it be a clogged oil passageway?

possible but unlikely
&gt; 
&gt; things I can do to keep the engine cool?
&gt; 
&gt; Leave the auxillary fan runnung and disconnect the hot air tube under the
&gt; cab?

would have no effect

&gt; Block the 2 passageways that let air flow from the main fan to the heat
&gt; exchangers. So that all the coolong air goes to the engine?

would help a little, but probably not more than one or two degrees

&gt; I would be most gratefull for any help as the whole familly is deperate to
&gt; go on this trip?

good luck.  check that cooling flaps, also did you get all the foam etc
back in after the head was put on.
