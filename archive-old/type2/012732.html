&gt;I continue to dial in my carbs on my 2liter, and 50's seem pretty good, 
&gt;but would love to try 47.5's because 45's are too low. Gene Berg does 
&gt;not have em......any other leads are appreciated.

Take your 45's to a shop that specializes in carburetors or maybe a high 
performance speed shop or a good machine shop.  They'll have drill bits for the 
half-sizes and can drill them out for you.  As far as I know you can't buy the 
half sizes over the counter any where.
