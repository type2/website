Subject: 3 More Early Busses Rescued - Pics!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi all-

Three more early busses  born to the world today.    Two 1967 Deluxe's (one a
21 window) and a 1961 Crewcab truck.  I finally was able to get a phone number
to the owner of these three busses in the mountains.  I had heard of them for
the last two years but was never able to track them down.  Went up for a nice
sunny Sunday drive to look at them after he returned my call this morning.
Came down thru the worst hail storm of my life that broke my front windshild.
Go figure.  El Nino is still with us.  

Seen the 21 window first and knew they had to be rescued.  The other two
busses were at the back of the property and equally impressive.   All are very
restorable.  All are drivers.  This was one hellava fun trip to be sure.....

The 21 has a fixable dent in the nose and passenger rear corner.  There is
some typical rust in small areas of the rockers, lower nose and the cab floor.
Nice sunroof top.  No back bumper or rear seats (so whats new??).  The bus
runs and drives.

The deluxe has a fairly new engine (5k miles with reciepts) and drives.  Not
much rust or dents that I could find.  No rear seats or back bumper.  BTW, of
the 15 or more busses that I have rescued in the last two years, few have had
the rear seat and none have had middle seats......  none.  Nice bus.

The crew cab is decent.  Minor rust in the cab floor,  Cherry gates.  Surface
rust on the truck bed but strait.  A rebuilt engine was sitting under plastic
in the bed.  Lots of parts also.  Really ugly yellow paint.  The seller said
he got it from auction years ago in San Fran.  It used to be a FBI sting truck
or something like that.  Hmm......  Has the original canvas bows in the truck
bed that have been shortended to roof hieght.  

The seller had complete reciepts for all vehicles since and before he got
them.  All have title.  I have about 8 or more busses to be rescue once I get
the time.  Stay tuned!
