Subject: RE: please stop the politcal bs
The Subject line says it all....If I wanted to listen to political crap, =
I'd turn on the tv...if I wanted political E-mail, I'd join a political =
discussion group.

Obviously I am doing neither by currently typing this response to a VW =
list.

For those of you who insist on putting their (unwanted) $.002 in....find =
another forum...just as you wouldn't be discussing Volkswagens in a =
political (or anyother group) discussion group, please don't be talking =
politics here.

Remember folks, this isn't a U.S. only group...you don't hear our =
bretheren from the UK, France, Germany, etc., talking their brand of =
politics here on the VW list. They have the courtesy to keep the =
politics out of the list...please reciprocate.

Thank you.

Ric
