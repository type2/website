Yeah, Herr Zeidler from the vanagon list inquired about this club
quebecois and I checked out their homepage (URL is not handy right now,
but it's in French anyway; ask and I'll dig it up). Very snotty indeed; 
they even made up a fancy coat of arms and spelled out a small
constitution. Very cute. The guy who formed the club (the Founding
Father?) nominated himself as &quot;President&quot;.  :-) Now, I find it odd that
this Westfalia club will actually accept non-Westfalia conversions
(provided, however, that they're based on a VW transporter, have a &quot;hinged
fiberglass top&quot;, and are not homemade). 

Jean-Baptiste, did you actually inquire about your eligibility or did you
just assume you're persona westfalica non desirata from reading their
homepage?
