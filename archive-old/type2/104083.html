This could be perhaps the infamous (so famous it's infamous) temp
sendsor II, which is very easy to replace &amp; check. but read on.

&gt; It has had a recent tune-up; 

First did the symptoms start right after this tune-up? 
if not, what did the tune up entale. Specifically what was done to the
engine?

&gt; all the fuel lines have been replaced
&gt; (healthy fear of fires); I replaced the fuel filter and the air
&gt; filter.  A cracked vacuum line was replaced, which helped only a
&gt; tiny bit.  

BTW, what is your vacuum at idle?

&gt; The timing is ok.  

I know this sounds insulting, but what was the timing set to? Also
just to double check what is the part number for your distributor
(it's located on the body of it.

&gt; The compression is 120 all around.  I am  getting depressed because
&gt; I strive to take good care of my bus and am under the impression
&gt; that lots of you guys are able to use your busses for daily
&gt; transport, not just shows and stuff.  

Until I parked it a few months ago I drove mine every day 85 miles
round trip. It always performed flawless. I only took it off the road
to retire the 236k engine &amp; rebuild it. I hope to have that done in
the next few weeks, so here's hoping. :) So they can become very
dependable transportation.

&gt; I will be heartbroken if I have to take it off the road; I know in
&gt; my gut that I will not have to , I guess I just need a little
&gt; emotional support.  Thanks in advance, Beth in NJ

Hang in there. After you get it in tip top shape, it will treat you
just as good as you are trying to treat it now.
