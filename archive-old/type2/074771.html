Subject: Re: [T2] 6K for a 1970 hardtop Westie? How to buy a bus.


&gt;I've found a bus that is really nice, but I think they might be asking too
&gt;much, so I wanted to get your opinion on the bus.   It's a 1970 westy
&gt;hardtop (supposedly).   The price they're asking is $6000.   Its been
&gt;completely stripped and all rust removed then repainted to white.   The
&gt;interior is completely redone to (supposedly) original condition.   The
&gt;motor and gearbox have been rebuilt approx. 10k  miles ago to original
&gt;specs.  It has a new braking system including master cylinder and all drums
&gt;and shoes.    The seller showed me receipts that totalled to about 10k.   3k
&gt;alone for the body and paint.

I paid approx. $3200 for mine (actually traded an Accord hatch that at the 
time I valued at $3200)  and I put another $750-$1K in paint (basic paint 
job), another $600-$750 in rubber and seals, a few hundred in a quicky 
motor rebuild, a few hundred in tires, a bit in powdercoating the rims and 
propane tank, a bit over $150 for AutoZone half shafts (local VW FLAPS CV 
boots failed in under a year), and still have to restore the interior, new 
poptop tent, etc. Oh and mine was a clean 175K mile bus. Original tranny.

When I get done - not including time and effort I will have over $6K in my 
bus. That does not include any of my wise guy ideas like a Corvair 
transplant, and any suspension, wheel, or brakes upgrades I dream alot about.

Read anything you can about buying vintage vehicles. Be aware of the basic 
cost of parts. Be aware of what you are ready to tackle personally and what 
you will have to hire a mechanic to do. Figure up the cost of parts needing 
attention, the cost of labor, and the cost of materials. Then decide if the 
bus is still worth buying to you. Like somebody else mentioned there will 
always be another bus to be bought so don't be too eager to jump on this one.

Even if they show receipts don't believe that the engine is guaranteed to 
be trouble free. Mine was sloppy and required new bearings. And this was a 
fairly new engine. I recognized this before I bought it. It may be new but 
it may also be a sloppy build. Is the motor and cooling system fairly 
complete?

Rust. Did I mention rust? Crawl all over this thing. Look under the floor 
mats, fender wells, behind the front tires, under the batteries. Do not buy 
a rusty bus for top dollar. You have to tackle and kill the rust or you 
will not have a decent bus for long (depending on the climate of the area 
you live in). I have seen very nice vehicles with new parts and paint that 
were worth half of their asking price b/c the new paint and parts hid rust 
rot, collision damage, and a long list of problems never really solved. If 
you can't do your own work repairing these items it could get expensive.

Lastly are you aware of the different busses and the camper and engine 
options they were offered with? Will you be happy with a Beetle powered 
bus? Are you aware of the VW heating system shortcomings? Are you aware of 
a busses slow progress from here to there? Are you used to the limits of an 
old vehicle.

I want to ask this just b/c I didn't notice whether this was your first bus 
or if you're an old hand at VW's or if this was your first old car and what 
your expectations were for it.

I have had alot of friends tell me they had often thought of buying an old 
VW bus but these same folks could not change their own oil or ever stand a 
chance of changing a clutch on their own and don't want to learn. Some of 
these folks think an old VW bus is like a 10 year old Honda which requires 
only a trip to Jiffy Lube every 3000 miles without considering the care 
that any old vehicle requires and what that can cost.

Good luck and keep us updated!
