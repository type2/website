Subject: Re: [T2] Help! Oil leaks without engine running? Help!


&gt;aluminium cooling fins mostly on the right but also a
&gt;little on the left side of the engine. The pushrods
&gt;are not immersed in oil are they? what about the oil
&gt;cooler? Help. Giles Clement

Wash off the engine and then watch the engine for a leak. The oil may be 
coming from further than you think. If it is a crack - worry not you might 
be able to fix it with JB Weld for many, many miles.

May be a pushrod tube. Mine leaked at the base once when I overfilled the 
engine...
