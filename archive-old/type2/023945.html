Subject: Hella dual battery relay fuse keeps blowing
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I installed the Hella dual battery kit exactly as per instructions, and it 
worked great for a week, then I noticed aux batttery wasn't charging.  The 
15A fuse attached to the relay was blown. so I replaced it.  Another week, 
and it worked fine (I checked it every time I drove it), then again this 
weekend, after a five hour drive to New Jersey, fuse is blown.  Blowing fuses 
in the engine compartment scares me just a little, so I was wondering if 
anyone else has had a similar problem, or might know what I may be doing 
wrong.  

Thanks, Don
