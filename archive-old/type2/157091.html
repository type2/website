Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Allen Head bolts (complete version)

--- Blissful Bus &lt;blissfullycrusin_at_gmail_dot_com&gt; wrote:

&gt; So, despite my best efforts (Soaking the bolts in pb
&gt; blaster on the
&gt; front and back side, hex bit on a socket) I still
&gt; managed to strip the
&gt; 3 allen bolts that holds the fan onto the hub.  I
&gt; believe they're #10
&gt; in this picture:

Quite often the problem with allen wrenches and socket
head bolts is that the allen wrench was unable to
reach very deep into the socket due to debris in the
hole. There could still be enough good surface at the
bottom of the hole... Prob #2 is that most allen
wrenches are slightly chamfered on the ends...

Solutions that have worked for me in the past:
(Combine all these steps!) Buy an &quot;Impact Driver&quot; (you
should have one of these anyway) These are to be used
with a hammer and a screwdriver bit and usually have a
3/8&quot; or 1/2&quot; square drive. Clean the inside of the
socket by blasting it out with brake cleaner spray and
the little tube nozzle thingy and follow up with a
needle or straight pin. grind the end of the
appropriate allen bit so it is flat and not chamfered.

Pound the modified bit into the bolt with a hammer.
Attach the impact driver to the bit. Hold tension on
the impact driver in the loosening direction. Smack
that impact driver hard and direct with a two pound
hammer.

If that fails, drill the heads off, remove the fan,
then you have the shafts of the bolts exposed to work
with.
Hope this helps. -BaH
