Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Child's Cot Storage




&gt;The correct cot for the 76 has telescopic poles that allow them &gt;to fit under
the back seat.  Found out the hard way that the &gt;width must be bigger when I
tried to use a cot from a 71 in my &gt;own 76.

&gt;Anyone want to trade?

James, good luck finding 76 to 79 collapsible bars. It took me almost 5 years to
find a set for my daughters 77.

68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4'' long.
74/75 bars are 57 1/4'' long.
76 to 79 half moons are 57 1/4'' wide. Yes, you can use 74/75 bars but 1) they
are just as tough to find and 2) you will nowhere to store them.....
