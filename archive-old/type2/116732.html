Subject: Re: [T2] kids and seat belts

I found this really helpful and enjoyed checking out the pics everyone has
for modding their vans.

I think if Im unsure about the safetly I wll simply keep them in their seats
and maybe devise a way to slightly tilt them (seats) so their heads dont' 
always seem
to be at hurtful angles.

It's one of those things I guess.. you don't want them flying around in the
event of an accident. But realistically the van is full of potential missles 
that
could hurt them anyway.

Sure is a change of thinking between yesteryear and nowadays :) Same
as the whole TV in the van chat.  We all have our feelings and it's a matter
of responsibility and safety (in this discussion anyway)

On another note.. it's -20 celcius and the 78 van is still cruising good.
Darn car is going to take another 3 weeks to get fixed :(

&gt;I forgot to comment on sleeping sideways in the rear bedseat when not
&gt;unfolded- this is less safe than sleeping in the rear with a barrier to
&gt;keep you from smashing into the hard cabinet or into the front seats.
&gt;I've tried to sleep on the full 74 bedseat we put into the 78 camper
&gt;( http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin - if down, too many hits and
&gt;email me for pics)- but it is awkward to use the stock belt and I make
&gt;sure any passenger doing this has their head on the noncabinet side or
&gt;rig up the tarp I discussed to prevent flying off the seat.
