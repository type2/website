Subject: Westfalia Tent Repair Parts and [f]

Happy Friday

I just purchased a westy tent from a fellow list member (hi, Darren) and
need sources/advice for a few missing bits. This is a later style tent with
floor which is a grey rubberized fabric. Along the edges of the floor,
there are &quot;loops&quot; for staking it down. The &quot;loops&quot; are actually a moulded
rubber piece which is glued onto the tent floor. I'm missing a handful of
these, and either 1) need to find a source for replacements, (preferrable)
or, 2) substitute something else in their place. Does anyone know of a
source for Westfalia tent parts or have a good alternative? My wife
commented that they looked like something that might also be seen on a
rubber raft for securing ropes to. Ring any bells? As always, thanks.

And... since it is Friday I'm enclosing the below story. Hope it doesn't
offend anyone. I got it earlier this week and made me laugh out loud in the
middle of a fairly crappy day.

One day at the end of class little Billy's teacher has the class go home
and think of a story and then conclude the moral of that story....

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their
story, little Suzy raises her hand.  &quot;My Dad owns a farm and every
Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell
them at the market.  Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and al the eggs flew
out of the basket and onto the road. &quot;  The teacher asks for the moral of
the story... Suzy replies, &quot;don't keep all your eggs in one basket.&quot;

Next is little Lucy...&quot;well my Dad owns a farm too and every weekend we
take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator.  Last weekend only
8 of the 12 eggs hatched&quot;...teacher asks for the moral of the story...
Lucy replies &quot;don't count your eggs before they're hatched.&quot;

Last is little Billy, &quot;My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, his plane
was shot down over enemy territory, he jumped out before it crashed with
only a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete.  On the way down he
drank the case of beer.  Unfortunately, he landed right in the middle of
100 Vietnamese soldiers.  He shot 70 with his machine gun, but ran out of
bullets so he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more.  The blade on
his machete broke, so he killed the last 10 with his bare hands.&quot;

Teacher looks in shock at Billy and asks if there is possibly any moral
to his story...  Billy replies, &quot;Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's
been drinking.&quot;
