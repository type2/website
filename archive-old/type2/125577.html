Subject: Re: Distrutor Drive alignment

Ahh, now THAT'S the type of golden nugget of info I've been waiting for. I didn't realize they were adjustable! 

The Dist. Drive Gear is the the little one on the bottom of the Dist. Shaft right? Yay, off to the Archives to see what I can find on Dist. Drive Gears. :)

Thanks 
Chris



&gt; Have you verified that the dist drive gear is installed correctly?
&gt; That might be your only problem. If it's off anyway, it might be a
&gt; good idea to set it correct, the distributor might fit now. IIRC it's
&gt; something like 12 degrees off from perpendulular when #1 at TDC of the
&gt; firing stroke.
