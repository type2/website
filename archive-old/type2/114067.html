Subject: Re: [T2] Re:smelly noisy brakes + loss of power

&gt;  After you drive your bus give it a wakaround inspection to see if
&gt;the wheels are hot.  Be careful as the wheels could get hot enough to
&gt;burn your hands.  Approach each one as if it were hot and then
&gt;determine if it is or not.  If the brakes are dragging it could be
&gt;caused by a number of different reasons.  Solve that and you may solve
&gt;your power problem too.

And use the backs of your hands so you don't injure the side of your hands 
that you use for work...
