Subject: Re: [T2] What is the deal with H4 lamps?

&gt; Ok, I have read some stuff about H4 headlamps and all, but nothing that

&gt; 1) Are they that much brighter?

No, unless you run brighter bulbs.  Stock bulbs are the same wattage as
sealed-beams

&gt; 2) If they are brighter, why?

Oddly, if aimed properly they appear dimmer!  The reason is that the light
is more evenly distributed without &quot;hot spots&quot;.  &quot;Hot spots&quot; actually
reduce your seeing ability.  The advantage to H4 lights isn't their
brightness, but the well-controlled beam.

&gt; 3) Do they give off a less yellow, more natural light?

The light is a bit more toward the blue end of the spectrum.  Not a big
deal except to the ad-writers.

&gt; 4) What do you think, ....think you could get away with them not being DOT
&gt; approved for regular use?

Many people do.  The only time you get looked at is if they are misaimed,
you use really bright bulbs, or if you have annual vehicle inspections.
