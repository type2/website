Subject: Re: Sway bar kit blow-out

Hey Folks,

I installed a set of these (gottem from
busboys...$175.00 *is* a great price) on my '69 and
the difference in handling is truly phenomenal! I
can't recommend them highly enough.

The kit comes with all the hardware you will need for
the installation, and the install is about as easy as
it gets. I've run mine for 2+ years with *zero*
complaints;-)
