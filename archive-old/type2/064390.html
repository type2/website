Subject: Starting problem - FI?

Hi all-

My 76 was not starting well, so I thought I'd try to fix it myself before 
coming here for help.  When I try to start the engine cold, it will not 
start right up like it used to.  It takes maybe 10-15 sec or cranking the 
starter, it will rumble a few times, and then finally start.  After it 
has started, it runs just fine.  It does not do this when the engine is 
warm.  It is tuned up.

So my logic was - what is different between starting and running?  Two 
things came to mind- the starter and the cold-start 5th fuel injector.  
It sounds like the starter is turning plenty fast.  And since this only 
occurs in a cold engine, I thought it might be the cold start valve. To 
test it, I disconnected the upper screw there, bend it back so I could 
see the injector, and had someone try to start it (The coil was 
disconnected too....).  The valve was squirting fine.  

So I guess my questions are:
Could the cold start valve be working only when I am messing with it?  I 
thought that if there was a bad connection, that when I pushed it I might 
temporarily fix that connection.  Is there anyway to tell if it is 
working without touching it?  Does that require a fuel pressure gauge?

Or, what else could I look at?

Many thanks-
Jess
