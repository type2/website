Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker lens seal

&lt;If your friend has to have the seals I think he will have to purchase 
&lt;the entire bulbholder unit which does come with a seal.  

If you are handy with a pair of surgical scissors you can cut out a new seal 
from rubber gasket material or closed cell foam sheeting salvaged from an old 
wet suit.
Use the old seal as a template.
Improvise adapt overcome!

Rusty
