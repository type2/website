Hi Duke

On 11/16/03, you wrote:

&gt; Not sure what to make of this one. Went to start it up on a cold
&gt; day. It fired right up and I let it run for about four or five
&gt; minutes. Backed out of my parking spot, put it in first, gave it
&gt; some gas and it died. At first I thought I just stalled it, so I
&gt; restarted it, let it run for a minute, and then it died again before
&gt; I even put it in gear. And would not start after that. The engine
&gt; turns over but it won't catch. I think it might not be getting spark
&gt; but I'm not sure. Any help is appreciated.

weather is turning cold here....how about you?

fuel filter?
moisture in your gas?
aux air valve not staying open long enough?
temperature sensor on head gone bad?
temperature sensor in AFM?


Sincerely,
