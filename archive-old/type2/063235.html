&gt; Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously
covered
&gt; by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.
&gt;

Campmobile 70 is the interior code for that particular interior, which was used
for several years, just as SO-42 was the model number for the earlier westy
interior.
So, It's probably a '71 with that interior.
To be sure, look at the vin, which should begin 231. Also check for disc
brakes, and flat hubcaps.
