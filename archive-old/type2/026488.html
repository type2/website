I don't normally do this, but I thought it was appropriate in this case.  I
found the following item on eBay and decided to foward it to the lists due
to the popular interest by many of you in 8-tracks.  I don't have any
connection with the seller so don't contact me about it.

Title of item:	PIONEER 8 TRACK &amp; TAPES A 35 YEAR COLLECTION
Seller:	terrljb_at_aol_dot_com
Starts:	04/06/99 12:24:14 PDT 
Ends:	04/11/99 12:24:14 PDT 
Price:	Currently $2.00
To bid on the item, go to:

Hope this didn't pi## anyone off too much.
