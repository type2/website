Hey ya'll..okay, I'm about ready to begin repairing the 
rust on my bus..I bought some POR 15. Here is my question. What is the
best type of paint I can use to repaint the spots that have rust damage?
Also, I Have rust around the windows and in various other places. Is it
safe to apply POR 15 to the spots around the window or are those just
better left alone? Any advice on rust repair will be appreciated. Please
email me directly.

Thanks,

Greg
