Importance: Normal

My old stock 1600 used to run around 220F pretty consistently on the highway
60MPH in the summertime. I had it up to 250F more than a few times( that's
usually teh limit where I would pull over and let her cool) without
suffering catastrophic failure.

I have since rebuilt my engine and installed a doghouse oil cooler and tin.
Now with summer fast approaching I haven't seen the temp much past 210F on a
hot day and usually running around 190 - 200F.

Depending on the ambient temp 220-30 may not be an unrealistic temp in the
summer on the highway. I have driven on road trips with other busses (same
engine 1600 single port) and we have compared temps at around 220-230F on a
hot day in july.
