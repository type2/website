Subject: Not getting the bus

Hi Volks...
I'm not getting the '66. It was a deluxe with the camper gear installed....
that would have been fine. The bus was actually really cute. The problem...
was the Rust.... There was rust, and a lot of it... I was wondering why he
never took pictures through the cargo doors... and it was because of the
rust, on the bottom of the doors, the floorboard, everywhere... it had eaten
through so bad, you could see through it...
So, I'm still looking for my &quot;Ripple&quot;...
If anyone sees a '63-69 in good condition, little to no rust, I'd like
original camper gear, if possible. I have the money to spend... Now I need
to find the &quot;Deal&quot;...
Keep in Touch...
Karen*
