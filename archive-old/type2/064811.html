New bushings, the front one are available.  I just bought one from a local
garage.  He had to order it from Boise but I had it in two days.  The rear
connector is available from (at least) JCW and RMMW.

&gt; Hoping that Mr. Hoover writes and I am just adding a &quot;me too&quot;, let me say
&gt; that I do believe that you are on the right track.  Alas, new bushings
&gt; are, as far as I know, not available.  In addition, installation involves
&gt; pulling the engine/transmission, which may make it worth your while to put
&gt; up with the problem :-).  If you do want the problem fixed, you will have
&gt; to haunt junkyards and fine a nice shift rod, without knowing what one
&gt; looks like, which means finding and measuring half-a-dozen and picking the
&gt; best.  An all-round bummer, IMHO.  I have the same problem, and am
&gt; learning to live with it, given that I don't feel the alternatives are
&gt; viable options :-(
