Subject: Re: [T2] oil leaks in upright bus engine

Well if oil cooler leaks you've got to begin there, which means remove
fan and engine. Since you'll be removing the fan pulling heads would
come almost for free that time.

However remember that whenever you pull the heads you are also signing
up for one engine pull in about 5000 miles to re-torque the heads.

It may be that the pushrod tubes leak because the heads are a tad
loose. In this case you're better off keeping the pushrods and their
seals in place and just torque the heads.

I'd begin by checking the torque on the 4 lower head nuts. If they are
not at spec, you need to torque all 8 nuts.
