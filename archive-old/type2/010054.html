Hey There,

Looking to contact a group called the &quot;Rhode Island
Aircooled Owners Association&quot;, or something like that.
A search of the web turns up nothing. This group
sponsors a vw car show at Scotts VW in East
Providence, RI.

The &quot;shake down&quot; continues on my '78 Westy, finally
inspected, cv-boots and engine seal (thanks ron!) go
in this weekend. Feels great driving a bus that was
rescued after sitting forgotten by the PO for 2 years.


Also looking for VW junkyards in Rhode Island, or
nearby South Eastern, MA with baywindow busses, so I
can grab some missing bits and pieces.

Thanks in Advance,
