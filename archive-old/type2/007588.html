	Well, I need some neat gauges to fill the hole in my dash where a radio
ought to be(Wish I knew why it's gone, or where it is now. Funny that the
P/O passed the radio manual on to me..) About what size gauge can I fit in
there? How many gauges could I fit. It's a '77 Westy. As for a radio, can I
set one to hang under the dash, and how should I handle that?

&gt; The new J.C.Whipme catalog, on page 125, lists an air/fuel gauge which
&gt; requires an oxygen sensor for a sender. It is a nulticolored bar
&gt; graph type
&gt; gauge showing a rich to lean condition. Being a gauge fanatic, this sounds
&gt; great to me (one more thing for my paranoid self to worry about). Anyone
&gt; ever used one? Anyone see any benefit aside from tuning the engine? TBear
