might 
&gt;want to see if it has a different VIN, and run that number by the local 
&gt;police dept...

Okay, it _is_ unethical, but sometimes you have a nice van with a lost, destroyed or otherwise un-obtainable title (depending upon how nutzo your state is about salvage titles/junk titles) and a junk van with a clear title and hey, what do you do?  Nobody stole anything from anybody.  You're just cutting through the state's red tape.  True - its also illegal but ask me about what Ky. is asking me to do to try and get a title for my ohio van and i'll tell you why it's gonna become a 78... 

-orange 75' with a title lost in the void...&gt;
