Subject: First trip in Bus ... tonight

Hello Everyone,

I have finally gotten my turn signal problem corrected...It was 2 things 

1. Turn signal relay was filled with water
2. Turn signal switch was missing many internal parts. When taking it out, I realized that broken tabs, and cut wires meant it had been worked on/replaced in the past...got one out of a junk yard, and after blowing a few fuses because I wired it up wrong, all is ok.

(I will post more on my site ( http://cowgar_dot_com/bus/ ) about this problem come Monday)

Now I am ready for my first trip. A friend of mine and myself are going canoeing at Beaver Creek State park here in Ohio. For us it's about a 2 hour trip. I know, not far, but I want to &quot;test the waters&quot; before taking a week long trip.

So, does anyone have any advice of things I should check, do, tighten, etc before camping trips? Usual stuff like tire pressure, oil, brake fluid but anything else? Anything I should take on the trip for my busses need?

Thanks!
