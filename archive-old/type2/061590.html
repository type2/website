Subject: Tan middle and rear seat in boneyard...

Hey folks....last weekend I heard tell of a bus that landed in a local
junkyard just a few days before.  They guys tells me &quot;looks just like that
one, but it's black&quot;.  (i'm driving the 66) to be sure, I'm like: &quot;It has
TWO windshields, right??&quot;

&quot;yeah, just like that one&quot;

Went out there, and found.......a black 76-79 with a blown engine.  *sigh*

It DOES have excellent condition tan middle (2/3) and rear seats.  If you
plan on being in the vicenity of augusta, or whatever, and have any
interest in these, let me know.  (even if you dont plan on being in the
vicenity, I'm sure we can figure some arrangement...:)

Not sure what they will charge for them,but the normally charge 20 bucks
for a bucket seat.._dot_can find out, though.

later...david
