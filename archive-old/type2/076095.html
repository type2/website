Subject: Re: Clutch Cable Grease Suggestions?

If you cannot take it out easily to re-grease it, get some of that lithium
grease in a spray can. It has a little tube on it like WD40. When you spray
it, it comes out mixed with a volatile carrier which evaporates and leaves
the thicker grease behind. The stuff is great for throttle, ebrake, and
clutch cables.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;I recently had to a first-time, emergency clutch cable replacement in my 79
&gt;bus and although I replaced the cable OK (w/ three manuals spread about), I
&gt;had to put it in with very little lubrication - I had none on board, and
&gt;all I was able to use was what grease was still on the old broken cable and
&gt;its clevis pin.  Since each manual I have (Muir, Bentley, Haynes) called
&gt;for the new cable to be lubricated liberally, I assume this is important
&gt;and plan to re-remove the new cable, grease it up and re-install it.  But,
&gt;I have no clue what kind of grease to use for this - can anyone suggest
&gt;what would be the best stuff to use for this application?  Thank you for
&gt;your help!
