&gt;&gt; Be careful about your phone number, though.  Lots of

&gt;Which is why I always give 'em my phone number from
&gt;.. was that three or four moves ago?  Been so long I
&gt;don't remember.  SnackShack, the Safeway/Albertsons/
&gt;wherever &quot;rewards card&quot; signups, various websites,
&gt;etc., etc..  
&gt; ...

Several years ago I had a Vons market discount card.
I used an old phone number and the name 'Ben Pon'.
Around two(?) years ago Vons/Albertsons/Ralphs employees
went on strike.  I quit shopping at those stores then.

The only thing I miss about that is the cashier saying,
&quot;Thank you Mr.Pon; you saved $2.47 today.&quot;     :-)
