Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Coil - Good to have or don't leave home without
  it?

what are the symptoms of a failing coil??



Well, one for sure that I know all too well is a bucking and jerking as you
get to the upper range in each gear. Had this problem one year on the way
to Everybus. Even though the problem looked FI related, it turned out to be
the coil, which I purchased at an Auto Zone in Lynchburg Va. on the way
home. And, BTW, it was a nearly new Bosch Blue coil that failed. The Auto
Zone one was some unknown brand, but it worked fine!    Jeff
