Subject: Gauges

Hi All,
Thanks for all the suggestions. Now comes the fun part of fitting them (read
find time!!). I'll just have to remember to watch the road and not the
gauges once they're in. If finances permit I will consider the Cyl. Head
temp. gauge (Thanks Steve D).
One question I did forget to ask regarding the Vacuum gauge is where to tap
in? On the Type 4 with carbs. I have two options. Either in the line from
the carb. to the vac. advance on the distributor, or in the line off the
central idle tube that operates the hot/cold air valve on the filter inlet.
Which is the better one to monitor?
Thanks,
Richard
