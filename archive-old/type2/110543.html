Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA supports AIR cooled community

&gt; but I got a letter today from VWoA,  really nice VW letterhead and envelope.
&gt;
&gt; it was a promotion for the Michigan VW Club annual event which VWoA is
&gt; getting involved with.

Me too. I was impressed that it was on VW stationary.
