Brad,
If you friend is looking for a restored westy, I will most likely be selling my restored 71.  Needs the engine put back in and lack of garage and driveway prevent me from finishing.  Have him e-mail me at atoz96_at_optonline_dot_net if he is interested.  It is located on Long island in NY.

I have a buddy who has located a '78 Deluxe Westy, Dakota Beige, 14500 =
miles, all original, no wear whatsoever, and is contemplating buying it. =
 I have seen this vehicle and it is in almost showroom condition.  =
However, the price is $16000 firm.
