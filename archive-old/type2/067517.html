&gt;I am not familiar with any of these parks, but I do have a suggestion of my

&gt;pretty common spot for VW enthusiasts.  I stumbled upon it in my first, and
&gt;quite spur-of-the-moment road trip and really enoyed the atmosphere of the
&gt;park as well as the town of Hot Springs.  I think I mentioned before that I
&gt;met a family at the campsite who were living out of a great old school bus
&gt;and working wherever they could.  They were also teaching their 7- or 8-
&gt;year old child Japanese.  Wow.  That's pretty much in a centrally-located
&gt;position as well, so maybe I can enter it in as a nomination?

I'll definately go to that one - Hot Springs is only a couple of hours from
me!  It's going to be a little chilly this time of year though...
