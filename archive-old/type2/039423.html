&gt; A lean mixture can cause this. If it has leaned out due to failure of
&gt; something from sitting, it may or may not be adjustable. Draining the old
&gt; gas and changing the fuel filter is in order. You may well have
&gt; contaminated the injectors.

--&gt; A lean mixture on an FI bus is also a very common symptom of a vacuum
leak somewhere.  Because this is an open-loop FI system, it can't
compensate for any air that doesn't get in through the AFM.  Check all the
vacuum hoses and manifold boots for looseness or cracks.  A common
culprit is the brake booster hose.

Another very common cause of a lean mixture is a bad cylinder head
temperature sensor.  The one on my '75 once failed shorted, making the bus
run full lean all the time.  Check it with an ohmmeter.

Your wandering timing may be a symptom of your other problem.  If the idle
speed wanders around, the timing will too!
