Subject: Brand new German VW 2.0 liter engines F/S

I have posted the availability of these engines once. I have had
requests to post more info and price about the engines from others
on the list, including a person who wants two and wants to keep another
is his garage for spare, so here we go:

These are 2.0 liter engines w/ hydraulic lifters
new VW German case (carb or fuel injected models)
new VW German heads (square port)
new VW German oil cooler
new VW oil filter

There are only 14 available and I am holding them till early next week
for the list and then a WD is going to take the rest (if any are
left) and raise the prices. This has got to be the last of these
available. Very rare find from one of the VW plants.

The price is $1990.00 plus freight from Calif.
