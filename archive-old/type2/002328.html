X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

List,

I've acquired a 7k VDO tach in an internet auction, and although it appears
as new there is no documentation with it. If anyone can help me with setup
info I would appreciate it.

The number on a sticker on the case is 1 211 001 972A. It has three
electrical terminals in a horizontal row, labeled (L-R) 4,3,2. It has a
plastic case, so I assume the terminals are for 12v, Ground, and input. The
question is which is which.

It has 3 dip switches, also in a horizontal row. I assume the purpose of
these is to set the number of engine cylinders.

TIA
