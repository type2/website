Subject: Re: Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to California!

You guys cracked me up. Thanks! I really needed that!

This weekend is going to be the deal maker/breaker for me since I went
and bought a third compression gauge (Still wondering where the last
one went to.) I can't get my carbs to balance for some reason, and I
discovered the other day the right carb was barely sucking air. My
concern is there is no compression on one cyl. I'm hoping for a stuck
valve or bad adjustment or somehting similar.

If it turns out to be more than a head, this bus is out of the trip.
Not to worry, though. I still have another bus that MIGHT be able to
do the job. It's my 71 with a shiny new 1776 that still needs bits
like muffler, generator, pulleys, dist (hate the 009), and either a
dual carb wiz to dial in the 40 IDFs or a stock 34 pict with intake. I
have HEs and 2 complete (I think) sets of tinwork.

I'll let everybody know!
