Subject: Re: Zelenda (???) and 12-point star sockets

&gt;&gt; BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?  Anyone know what
&gt;&gt; size?  If I try Torx, am I just asking for stripped bolt heads?
&gt;&gt; On the 12-point thingermajigger, if I do find a place that sells it,
&gt;&gt; what size do I need?

I was not able to torque the bolts all the way to spec with the Torx
thingermajigger.  It would slip before it was &quot;tight enough&quot;.  I'd
look for the 12-point one.  Unless your CV is already toasted, its
probably going to last the week it would take to get a local tool shop
to order you one.  (I say probably with all the knowledge and
confidence of someone who still looks over the manual when doing a
valve adjustment, so have some salt with this advice:)

take care,
        brandy
