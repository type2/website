List,
Didn't the old adventurewagen steps originally retract
when the door was closed?

I have one of these steps from a 71, but i never found
any linkage that would cause it to retract
automatically. May have been removed.

It is retractable, but manually -meaning you get out
and push it back under the bus.
About 2 feet wide and mounts to the frame and
crossmembers.
