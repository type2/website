Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Scale

Thanks for the tip. I know that there are a couple of places I mail order
one from in the US, but cross-border mailorder is a bit of a PITA, and I
would like to avoid it if I can. I am just hoping that someone has a
picture, or can just tell me what the three notches in the scale represent.
Cheers,
Matthew

&gt; Matthew,
 Have you looked at www.bustedbus_dot_com
 They have used parts and such, $5 for a timing scale.
 Look under [ engine - clutch ] , sub menu [ housing fan ]
 Alex.
