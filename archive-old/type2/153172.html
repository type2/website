Subject: woohoo - passed emissions

i'm always amused when i do... as it never seems to make sense!

  HC idle limit/measured: 500/382
CO idle  limit: 5.50/1.36

  HC load:500/207
CO load: 4.20/3.56

1685cc, this is with a newish brasol 30/31, 125 main, 135z air, idle 
and pilots 65.  my afm gauge reads full rich most of the time, and 
the tailpipe is sooty black. so i SHOULD be rich. i know that if i go 
up in main size, i get rotten mpg and boggy performance; down, i get 
hot heads.

i do have a honking great exhaust leak on the left side - wonder if 
that was leaning out my readings on th test stand?  at least THIS 
time i only had to do idle/load tests.... before, they made it do a 
profile run simulating a freeway trip, and the test monkeys ALWAYS 
missed shifts and kept having to redo it.....
