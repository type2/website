Subject: [T2] 1968 color wiring diagram

List,

We're getting ready to replace the main harness in our 68. We have the
Bentley with a b/w diagram, does anyone have (or know of a place online) a
copy of the color diagram? The archives directed us to the Vintage Bus
wiring diagram page, but of course, they don't have one for the 68 model.
TIA

Jon
