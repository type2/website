Subject: VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify these
  tires.

The quick and dirty;
VW recommends these tires for your 1971-1979 van:

185 R 14 C, load range C
185 SR 14 Reinforced
LT 185 R 14 Load Range C.

A close fit, that works (personal experience) is a LT 195/75R14 Load Range C
(almost the same size, ~.5&quot; wider than 185R14).
Note: LT does not always appear on the tire. If it has a &quot;Load Range&quot; rating
letter, it's a LT (or truck) tire.

Caveats: Make sure the tire is Reinforced or a LT tire.
Make sure the tire has a max inflation greater than it says on your van, be
it in the gas door, doorjamb, or steering column.
Make sure the &quot;Maximum Load&quot; is greater than 1/2 the GAW of the axle you're
installing it on.


Before you respond, please read the rest.


Quoted from my 1979 Type 2  Volkswagen Owner's Manual:

Page 53
&quot;Your VW is equipped with tubeless tires of either designation:

185 R 14 C 6 PR*
or 185 SR 14 Reinforced

* The 'C' type tire also bears the label 'Load range C.'&quot;

&lt;snip&gt;

Now this is interesting. Read the last sentence above and these next two
carefully, as there are two &quot;C's&quot; involved, and they mean entirely different
things.

&quot;The letter 'C' stands for 'commercial,' the European rating similar to the
domestic 'LT,' meaning a tire for light trucks.  The words 'Load Range C'
stand for load range C in a COMMERCIAL tire.&quot; (emphasis not added)


From what I gather, an LT tire sold here in the states is equivalent to a
&quot;commercial&quot; tire sold in Europe. The tires sold on the van when new were a
load range C. Therefore, an LT 185R14 load range C would be a VW recommended
replacement, according to the owner's manual.


Nowhere in the owner's manual did I find any reference to &quot;maximum load.&quot;
Maybe there is a reference in the &quot;Campmobile&quot; supplement.


This is not to say it did not exist in manuals from other years/regions, but
it isn't in mine, and I suspect it hasn't been since the vans were equipped
with radials when new (1971). It isn't likely you'll find LT tires in the
load range of C that do not meet the &quot;maximum load&quot; required of this
vehicle, but I would ~always~ verify that the tires meet at least half the
Gross Axe Weight of the axle they're being installed on. See below (in
&quot;Overloading&quot;) regarding the Bently take on this.


On to Sir Bently.


8.13.1 Wheels
&quot;...Tires of nonstandard size may be used only if the tire manufacturer
specifies them for your make and model VW.&quot;

8.13.2 Tire Types And Pressures
&quot;...Caution-Not all bias ply or radial ply tires are the same. When you buy
replacement tires, select only bias ply tires that have an 8 ply rating;
select radial ply tires designated 'reinforced' or, for Delivery Vans and
Station Wagons, with the suffix 'C.' Other tires of identical size may have
inadequate load carrying capacity.&quot; (remember, that suffix means
&quot;commercial,&quot; which equates to LT, not &quot;load range C.&quot; -ed)

8.14 Brakes and Wheels Technical Data
III Tire Data
  Footnotes (referring to the two types of OE tires, *Reinforced and
**Commercial, -ed.)
   &quot;* Correct replacement tire must bear the word 'REINFORCED'. The maximum
inflation listed on the tire should be 40psi.
   ** Correct replacement tire must bear the letter 'C' immediately after
the number 14 in the size designation-and not elsewhere. The maximum load
inflation pressure listed on the tire should be 55psi. (I believe this to be
a misprint or an outdated spec. ...virtually ALL load range C tires have a
max. load inflation of 50psi. -ed).&quot;

So, passenger car tires are not recommended unless they are designated
&quot;Reinforced,&quot; regardless of their &quot;maximum load&quot; rating. They simply do not
have adequate sidewall strength.

The only reference to &quot;maximum load&quot; I found in Bently is in 13.7:
Overloading
&quot;...The maximum load capacity... added to the weight of the vehicle, must
never exceed the total load capacity of the four tires (marked on their
sidewalls.&quot;
For my '79 Kombi (the Kombi has the greatest GVW, not the campmobile), that
works out to 5070 lbs. (ACK! Two and a half TONS?) divided by four tires is
1267.5 lbs.

The above are the manufacturer's recommendations, not mine, and vary by
model.

The &quot;C&quot; (as in commercial), &quot;LT,&quot; and &quot;Reinforced&quot; have more to do with
sidewall strength than load carrying capacity. If you look only at the
maximum load capacity of the tire, you're missing out on the sidewall
strength, one specification stressed as necessary by VW.

The &quot;Load Range&quot; indicates the capacity of the tire to hold air (i.e., load
range C has a max inflation of 50psi, D is 65, etc., this varies as tires
get larger). As compared to ply ratings, yes, more plies = more ability to
hold back air pressure. The maximum load of a tire is rated at its maximum
pressure.

Given two identical tires, one load range C and one D, the D will have a
higher maximum weight capacity because you can pump 15 psi more air into it,
which in turn will prevent it from flattening out as easily.
Does that mean it will support more weight if you don't add more pressure?
Absolutely not. It's the air supporting the weight, not the tire.
