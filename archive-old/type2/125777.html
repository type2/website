Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

I painted the floor of my trunk in an old Mercedes with it once. I was
amazed at how the floor seemed to get stronger. This was made further
evident a year later when I hit a speed bump a little too fast and the
floor stayed together but dropped out of the trunk. My lesson there was
to paint even where you don't see the rust, and to do the opposite side.

&gt; As for waiting untill it's dry man, make sure you give it a good LONG
&gt; time to dry. Like several days if not a week. It feels dry and is hard
&gt; after 12  hours or so, but it gets stronger and stronger untill it's
&gt; fully cured. If you cut off the moisture supply (yeah, it cures faster
&gt; with higher humidity, go figure) by spraying in bedliner too soon, you
&gt; may prevent it from fully curing.
