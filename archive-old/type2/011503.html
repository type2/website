Subject: Wanted to Trade  - childs cot
To: LagWagens Rule &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey there Volks,

I have a childs cot from a 69-73 westy (56 1/4 inch poles) in
excellent condition, that I'd like to trade for childs cot for a
76-79 (2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, galvanized poles) in similar
condition.

If anyone has a single 2 piece pole from a 76-79 westy for sale I'd
be interested in hearing from you. 

Pmail me at grnmnstr_at_yahoo_dot_com .

Thanks,

=====
