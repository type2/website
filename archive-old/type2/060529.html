Subject: Re: gas in oil

       You don't mention anything about having a pressure regulator in
between the electric fuel pump and the carbs. It's a *MUST HAVE*. In
fact, if you are trying to use the pump for the FI setup, take it out
immediately and replace it with a $25-30 unit from your FLAPS, that has
much lower pressure. But even then you need a pressure regulator, unless
the pump is truly *low* pressure.
       What's happening is that the needle valves in the float chamber
just get pushed aside by the high pressure. And that FI pump is very
high pressure -- heck, sell it. They're $200 new.
