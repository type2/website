&gt; Now I am tired of hearing one poster
&gt; saying you CAN'T use a stock cam with hydraulics and another saying you
&gt; CAN..and the claim the case supplies oil differently to hydraulic
&gt; lifters-what is the real bottom line story here?  Karl?

When I talked with Steve and Debbie at webcam over the phone a few months
ago they told me the ramp of the solid cam vs. hydraulic cam was different
and you shouldn't swap in lifters designed for another cam.
