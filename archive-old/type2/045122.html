Subject: [T2] Electronic Ignition

Sorry to ask this of the list, I tried to use the archive search but was
messaged that it is down for maintenance.

Has anyone used a MagFire electronic ignition system?  Is it reliable?
I'll be placing it into a 1600 CC Single Port with a 009 distributor.
(It came that way in the bus - 69 Westy).
