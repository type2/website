Subject: RE: [T2] Asbestos?




&gt; Thanks for all this Richard,  I had noticed the collars that fits on the
&gt; end of the heat exchanger and the flexi pipe before.  What I'm actually
&gt; looking at  is the long tube that goes straight up the centre of the van
&gt; and has the insulation all the way round it, is this insulation also made
&gt; of asbestos?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again
&gt; Matt
