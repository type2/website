Subject: Bus Electrical Purgatory

Hello all, thank you in advance for any advice that can be offered.  Here's
the situation:
I drive a '73 transporter, 1700cc engine, factory Air Conditioning, actually
was manufactured in November of 72, but its the 73 model year, so that's
what I'll go by.  The jist of the situation is the electrical system hates
me, I try and be nice to it but lately it hates me.  The bus won't start,
that's the main problem, well it will start when I've just charged the
battery but after I only drive it for
like 10 minutes its jumper cable time.  I've replaced the
battery, the generator, the voltage regulator, the heater blower relay (J14
on the Bentley schematics), the
battery cables are new, I just installed a new ignition switch, and I just
last evening installed a &quot;Hard Start&quot; relay kit from Bosch that claimed to
let me start at a lower battery voltage by eliminating 15 feet of wiring.  I
don't have any current electrical readings, but I can get them if anyone is
interested.  I'm very frustrated at this point, and have more than once
considered buying a new car and giving up.  But now I've decided that I
can't let this beat me, so I'm re-organizing my attack pattern.  There are
two other problems that are occurring, the cable that connects the left side
heater control lever to the mechanism that changes between heater and
defroster is broken, and secondly the generator light and the brake lights
come on, only halfway until the temperature lever is pulled down then they
come on all the way, and stay on all the time.  Anyhow, if anyone has any
ideas and or input on what do to, please let me know, all help is
appreciated.
