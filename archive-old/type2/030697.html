FOR SALE: (Near Pontiac Michigan)
1971 Westy - Red, 118000 miles, Runs Great, Drives Well. Arizona Bus, now
transplanted in South Eastern Michigan for the past 4 years.  No Rust, but
large dent in rear passenger corner.  Have New Canvas Tent for it.

1971 Bus - Parts Bus. Red/White, No Engine, Has trans, Drivers side
damaged (Middle Panel), and Front Nose Damage. Rear Passenger Panel
perfect for replacing dented one on the Westy.

Parts from a 1972 Bus also availible (no motor or trans). Seats, Glass,
Doors, Hatches, Gauges, wheels, tires, etc.

PRICE?? The first $2500 takes it all!  I'm a poor college student who
really can't afford to have 5 cars... My beloved projects must go,
tuition and loans are due...All reasonable offers considered, and Large
parts from the parts busses can also be purchased separately (Not
Preffered, but can accomodate.)

ALSO For the W/C crowd...
1983 GTI - Black, Red Interior. New Parts (Less than 6 months and less
than 2000 miles): Both Driveshafts, front discs + pads, heater core, hood,
full tune up (plugs, wires, cap, rotor, oil, etc). Runs like new, 197000
miles, but still drives great. 20-22 MPG. Originally equipped with A/C and
Cruise control, however both are non-functional currently... Originally
purchased for Autocrossing, but the suspension setup I wanted costs twice
as much as the books for my classes this term. Has aftermarket upper
stress bar on front. NO RUST!! Small dent over driverside rear
wheelhousing.

Asking $1000 or best offer for GTI.
