Subject: Yellow Westy Bay on I-75

Was zipping along on I-75 heading back south from Lexington, KY after 
adopting a Blue Beltian English Setter in our CR-V running about 80 mph 
with the rest of the traffic.

Come up on a tangle of slowing cars, everybody trying to merge into the 
fast lane - rigs and cars and vans.

Wondering what the problem is I wait for my turn to pass the tangle of 
slowing cars only to see a late 70's VW Westy bay buzzing along at 60 mph. 
It was a New York Westy (with the standard issue rust peeking through 
everywhere) and had stuff painted all over it announcing they were 
poisonous snake experts and warned of them being carried on board.

Was just a reminder that on fast highways our busses are a bit out of their 
element! &lt;grin&gt; Seems like a good reason for a big Raby, Boston Bob, or 
Trans-Vair conversion just so we can keep up.

Was this anyone on our list?

By the way the dog is doing GREAT! She is well behaved, anxious to please, 
and very patient. I've had many over the years but never one so well 
behaved. She was a bit timid but that is wearing off. Got to get her 
spayed. We discovered the world is FULL of unwanted dogs and puppies and 
waiting for a rescue just like this good girl was. Spay or neuter your dog 
please. Off my soapbox.

Ciao!
