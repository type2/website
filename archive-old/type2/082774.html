&gt; I vote for Glacier National Park and the Tetons and skip Yellowstone.  Have
&gt; a great time, I'm jealous.

John,

NO! NO!  Don't drop Yellowstone!  *ADD* Glacier and the Tetons!  of
course, he'll need to  add a week, but hey... since we are planning his
trip, we can dream, can't  we? :-)

Glacier is one of the few Nat'l Parks in the lower 48 I have not gotten
to.  Big Bend down in Texas is another.  Both are way out of the way from
anywhere and supposed to be worth every mile.

&gt; 6) It would help to get some sort of guide book before going to
&gt; Yellowstone. Planning is good.

Excellent advice!  more reading is always good.  the more you know before
you start, the better the trip will be.

&gt; 7) Another nice stop nearby is Thermopolis, WY, about 90 miles south of
&gt; Cody. Thermopolis is the home of the world's largest mineral hot spring.

YES!!!  BTDT!  well worth the effort.

&gt; 8) Tensleep Pass (in WY) over the Bighorns is a spectacular drive.

I want to do this one someday very badly.  Again, it has an excellent rep.

&gt; 10) The Grand Tetons are really beautiful.

The Grand Tetons are, however, not for people in VW buses :-)  At the very
least, do *not* be tempted by Rt. 22 coming out!  It is the *steepest*
road I have ever been on!!!  the SUVs were in 2nd!  I agree that it is
among the most beautiful places on earth, but it is also among the most
abrupt.  do it if you want, but an oil temp gauge should be required,
like chains in the passes in the winter.  No gauge, no go.

&gt; 11) Wind Cave National Park has a small campground that costs about
&gt; $10 a night,and has a resident herd of bison. It's about 6 miles north
&gt; of Hot Springs, SD, which has a operational woolly mammoth dig that
&gt; was discovered during excavation of an apartment complex about 25
&gt; years ago: worth the visit. The caves at Wind Cave and Jewel Cave are
&gt; both worth visiting.

How did I forget this!?!?!?  A big Amen to David!  What a wonderful
experience the cave was and the mammoth dig was also incredible.

&gt; 14) About reliability: we've had problems each year we've driven out,
&gt; including the year we took our F*rd Taurus. We're coming close to
&gt; accepting them as part of the journey.

Yup!  Same here.  At the same time, there is nothing to unite you and your
bus like changing out a dying clutch cable in the NFS campground above St.
George, Utah :-)

Which brings up National Forest Service (NFS) campgrounds.... I love them
and rely on them!  they are marked in most atlases and are cheap and good.
