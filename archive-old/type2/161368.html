this is a classic sunken valve seat. i have at least 10 heads here  
that look exactly the same. you probably drove for 100's or maybe  
even 1000's of miles for it to look like that. it is always the  
intake valve that goes, and almost all of the heads that do it this  
way are 2 litre heads. It is almost always #2 intake also. I think  
the instructions for CHT gauge installation should be changed to  
using #2 cylinder for the sender, because there is pretty good  
evidence #2 runs the hottest.

when you repair the engine you have to repair the cause of that  
overheating condition.
