&gt; Here are a couple of ideas you might want to check out...........
&gt; 
&gt; When I need matching paint for any of my cars I trip on down to my local 
&gt; NAPA.  They have a paint match system and if the guy who's using it is any good, 
&gt; you'll get a terrific product.  Yes, they can put your color into rattlecans 
&gt; also.  Cost the last time I went this way was $45 for three rattlecans.  By the 
&gt; way, perfect match!

there also is the &quot;Preval&quot; load it yourself spray bottle, it is a glass
jar with a screw on presure can and spray nozzle...not cheap but not $15
each either, I got em at the local FLAPS
