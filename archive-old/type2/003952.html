I am having a problem with the fuel gauge on my '77 Westi.  Most of the time
when you start the engine the needle will climb to where the fuel level is
(I think/hope) and then slowly drop down past empty.  The other times the
gauge does not register at all.  When the needle climbs it sometimes
shudders like it is stuck and when it fall it bounces.  The PO said the
sender needs to be replaced and it would cost approx. $300.00 CDN to cut the
access hole and fix it.  Is this the only way to correct my problem?  I
would like to have this looked after ASAP since I plan on doing allot of
travelling this year.  Also, there is a fuel smell at times in the cabin,
especially after filling it and going around turns.  I think the vent
hose(s) are leaking.  Can this be fixed as well when they cut an access hole
for the sender?

As a final note, can anyone tell me where in Niagara Fall is the 13th Annual
June Jitter Bug being held.

Thanks,

Peter
