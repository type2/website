Subject: engine out, time to replace seal!

Well after dinner I invited my 2 biggest friends over to pull the engine 
out, only a couple of snags, and a lot of rusty bolts. Turned out to be a 
little tougher than that bug engine I pulled this summer, and somewhat 
heavier (thats what the big guys were for). So tomorrow I will install the 
rear input shaft seal and hopefully the engine will slide right back in. As 
always suggestions are welcome.

Lookin forward to gettin back on the open road,
Nathan
