&gt;
&gt;i can't imagine a class III huricane packing 115mph is gonna be all that
&gt;weak when it heads 2 hours inland. hmm, question is, will Rumba the 74
&gt;Retrowestie get me home without being blown off the road. anyone driven
&gt;a van in a hurricane before and are still around to talk about it? :-)
&gt;maybe they will let us go home early? i don't think a van is what you
&gt;want to drive if you have to drive in a storm like this.....

&gt;jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Ru/\/\bA)

I think the question is will it blow over while parked?
I flew my van home once in 40MPH crosswinds, and it was one of the wildest 
drives I've had in my life. Makes freezing rain look sticky. I made the 
week of white water kayakig I was returning form look tame.
sort of like rrrrrrRRRRRRrrrrRRrrrrrRRRRRRRRR!!!!rrrrRRRRRR!Aaaaaaah!!rrrr
