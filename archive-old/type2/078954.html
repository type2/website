What the heck are you doing in Calgary!! ?  :-)
I guess you checked Canadian Tire eh? Let me look at my friends house, he
came down from kamloops and I thought he said he had one that went on the
sump plate of a Type1 engine. If he has it still, I'll see if he wants to
move it on. Lots of work still in Calgary?
Take care,
Courtney

&gt; &gt; Hello again all listees, just moved back from Victoria, BC Canada (on
the wet west coast) for those who don't know shangri-la to icy Calgary,
Alberta (hi Courtney).  I'm badly in need of a block heater for my '76 bus.
I've looked high &amp; low on every website I know (cip1_dot_com, bus depot, etc)
and nobody has them.  Not very surprising as how many people drive their
busses in the winter?  That is, true winter, Canuk style.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've seen magnetic ones at FLAPS which are around 3&quot; wide and 5&quot; long
which could mount on the bottom of the engine but I don't know how much heat
would actually transmit through to the oil.
&gt;
&gt; I have one that slips into the dipstick,  seems to work reasonably well
&gt; especially if the engine is warm when you turn it on.
&gt;
&gt; picked it up at the local FLAPS
