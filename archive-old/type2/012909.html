Paul,

Where in San DIego do you have your locks done?  I've
got a hatch lid latch that I need to either have a key made for
or rekeyed for my '71...

Thanks,
	tom in PB

&gt; I just had 3 copies made for my '72 Westy.  If all else fails, you can
&gt; send them to me and I'll get them done here in San Diego.  Cheaper than
&gt; RMMW.   But check a few more local places first.  Real locksmiths, not
&gt; Home Depot.
