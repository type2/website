Subject: Bus paint jobs

My bus was covered in faded house paint when I took it to different
shops for estimates.  Each of the shops made a painful looking face when
I showed it to them, and then one guy's eyes lit up when he saw it and
he got excited about what all he could do with it.  That was the guy I
decided to take it to.  He was a small, self-owned shop, and
unfortunately isn't in business anymore, but he got the job because he
didn't look at my bus like it was going to be a nightmare, that and he
cut us a good deal.  I was heading into my first year of college then,
and couldn't have my bus at school anyway, so he stored it for us for
the year and worked on it in his spare time.  I guess the point of this
is don't just look at the popular name places.  There may be a smaller,
independently employed person somewhere who would give your bus alot
more TLC.
