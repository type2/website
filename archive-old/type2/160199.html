Also I was lucky enough to pick up a set of for lack of a better way to
describe them (ambulance fans) for my bay window. Such as the ones pictured
here:

Looking at the picture on the ad I would assume that the fans blow the wind
towards you looking at the face of the fans. But in fact mine blow them out
the back where the winding is (towards the top if your looking at the
picture). I've looked at my Bently wiring diagram and have the wires in the
correct place.

I guess I just need to know what way the fans should be blowing looking at
the picture (up or down)?
