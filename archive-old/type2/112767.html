&gt; Subject: Junk / Parts
&gt;
&gt; I'm clearing out my shed and I have a few parts I don't know what to do
&gt; with.  I have a 72 bus transmission I bought a few years back as a
&gt; &quot;rebuilt&quot; from some cut rate dealer advertised in Hot VW's.  It leaked
&gt; oil from the beginning and finally wouldn't stay in first gear after
&gt; about a year.  Before I haul it off the the scrap heap I thought I'd
&gt; make sure this is not some super rare part that somebody could have
&gt; used.  Does anybody want this, free?

I'm not sure where you're at but here in California a Bus tranny is worth at least $50
just as a core. There's a guy that makes a living by running up and down the state to
all the VW FLAPS delivering rebuilt engines and trannys and picking up cores to deliver
to the builders in SoCal. I think that's why its so hard to find a Bus tranny in the
Pick-n-Pulls around here.
