Subject: McMaster Carr

Hi folks,
    They do have a catolog and website filled with all sorts of neat stuff.
Someone else said they felt like a kid in a candy store looking through the
catolog, and I'm going to second that.  Best of all, they DO sell retail to
the consumer.   I know, I've ordered from them.  My experience has been to
recieve good service when ordering by phone and the product shows up
quickly.
    All that said, if I can get a product from one of our VW vendors I
ALWAYS go that route first.  After all Mcmaster Carr is never going to sell
the automotive parts to keep our buses running well.  I want these vendors
to still be around when I need the stricktly automotive stuff, so they are
the ones who get my business first.

good day everbody
