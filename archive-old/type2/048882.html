Subject: [T2] Hall Sender Unit

Has anyone ever experienced problems with their Hall sender unit.  My '79 
California style FI bus apparently needs a new Hall sender unit.  The flars 
guy wants to charge me $255.00 to do this. I believe replacing the Hall 
sender unit is not that difficult.  Is the Hall sender the same thing as the 
electronic ignition.  Is it the piece that fits down inside the distributer? 
  Could it cause my bus to run fine for a day or two and then die only to 
start the next day fine?  I really don't want to pay the money to replace 
something that doesn't need it.  I guess I should trust the mechanic but I 
have a hard time doing so.  I could do it except for the time.  I need my 
car and I would have to wait to have the part sent to me.  Any suggestions 
or past experience with a Hall sender would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Meredith
