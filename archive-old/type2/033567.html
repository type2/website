&gt;&gt;The 27&quot; size nets you about an inch of ground clearance and I think about
&gt;&gt;5mph speedo error at 70mph.
&gt;
&gt;When I put the 27&quot; BFG's on my bus, it corrected my speedo error.  It used
&gt;to read over 6% fast, now it reads only 2% fast (according to police
&gt;radar).  Those of you that think you are going 85+ in your busses (Gensler

David makes a real good point the Bus speedos are so notoriously optimistic
that the hypothetical error I mentioned is actually a positive thing most times.
I'd also note it was 27x8.5 BFG's I'd run before as well, so I still won't garantee
the Firestone will fit a Bus, probably will and it is a good, cheaper, tire.

I've about 25k on these things I think though they have been on 3 Vanagons so
I've lost track and they are still in very, very, good shape, still handle wonderfully
and are easily up to any load.  Firestone ATXII buy a set for yourself, feel the
extra inch it takes to hoist your ass into the Bus.
