Subject: Brake Lights

Greetings, List-

I have noticed that it takes very firm pedal pressure to make my brake
lights come on. I have new pressure switches installed since putting the bus
on the road about a year ago. The brakes themselves work great- high pedal,
firm stopping power. It's just that the brake lights don't come on from
moderate pedal pressure; you know, the kind of pressure you use in traffic.

Is this normal or do I have a problem?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
