Subject: Re: [T2] Pop Top


Hi Chris,
	I have an entire '71 Westy I'm trying to unload.  The top is in great 
shape, as is the rest of the vehicle.

	Eron Crites


&gt;To the List,
&gt;
&gt;I'm  looking for a replacement pop top for my 71 westy.
&gt;I pulled the top off my 72 and when put against the green 71 I saw that the 
&gt;front of the top was warped by years in the sun.
&gt;
&gt;I was hoping to find a Country Homes or Sportsman top but have not been 
&gt;able to find one as I wood like to sleep 4 without doing the cutting for 
&gt;the 74 top or newer. I may just sick with the original stile.  but hope 
&gt;someone can help.
&gt;
&gt;Chris

&gt;Thank you,
&gt;
&gt;Chris Jackson
