Graham,

Well, as to the deep cycle batteries, consider the weight to gain ratio along
with your needs.Now that I have researched solar options, I am sure you can
never justify it financially. When I have the $800-1000 needed to put solar
cells on the roof (3-2.5 amp panels), I will, but I will never try to justify it
beyond that it is something I just want to do. It looked like about $150 an amp
to me, and even then for only 12 hours of the day at best. Remember:
Watts/Volts=Amps.

But this VW bus of ours is really much more than any practical pursuit!

&gt; I intend to put a bunch of deep cycle batteries (12 volt) into my 75 bus...
&gt; any comments? Also I want to put solar panels on the roof... recently I saw
&gt; a mention of this on the list. Can some *generous* person direct me to the
&gt; link?
