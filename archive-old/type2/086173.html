&gt;I have finally done it!! I just purchased my first VW. It is a 70 Bus pop 
&gt;top.. I have been researching VW's for around 6 months now. I am from 
&gt;Jackson, Mississippi, and will be traveling to Sarasota Flordia to pick the 
&gt;van up. I have purchased the Muir manual and have read pretty much all of it. 
&gt;Anyways, I wanted to send this to everyone who will be on the route I will be 
&gt;taking home. I would appreciate anyone along I-75 and I-10 to send me their 
&gt;numbers so I can keep just incase something were to go wrong...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks-Look foward to talkin to everyone as my first VW project comes along.
