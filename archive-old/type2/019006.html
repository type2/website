Re Dr Tim's comment about oil starvation using an external oil cooler:
Back in my formative days, I took the sumplate off my 71 bus and welded
(braised) in two  1/2&quot; pipe elbows (the pickup pipe extended into the
elbow; the sump pipe was virtually flush with the plate). Then ran pipe
to a finned radiator (4 pass and an oil filter in series.  Basically,
the oil was sucked through the filter and cooler and then on to the
usual stock cooler or bypass if cold.   Since this was all below the
level of the sump, I never worried about draindown, and it took longer
to reach pressure only after an oil change.  Recall I went around the
country in '76 that way- real easy to change oil; just pulled a hose
clamp!  Only problem I recall with that engine was a cracked oil passage
right behind the flywheel (a bitch; at first assumed it was a leaky oil
seal!!!!!)-can't say if that was before or after this cooling
trick.         Since you are a mechanic, Tim, you'd appreciate this
story- I did a lot of trips to Fla from Syracuse Un. NY to visit the
retired parents, and once put on big bore cylinders, not realizing the
wonders this does to your compression ratio- bombed down to Fla with
great power, but within 50 mi of arriving it was running on 3 cylinders;
I vaguely recall disabling the bad cylinder (pulled plug; prevented
valves from opening by pulling pushrods???) and being poor, pulled the
motor in parent's drive, removed the bad head, and the ex. valve looked
like a 3 cornered revolutionary hat!  Seat looked all warped, so I
bought one good valve and a whizz disk (carborundum cloth disk for a
drill)- epoxied a piece of carborundum disk to the valve head (ground it
down to fit the piece) and inserted it into the head and put a drill on
the stem- spun it to round out the seat, lapped the piss out of the new
valve, and reassembled the motor- to adjust that sucker, I had to grind
some metal off the valve end, it sat so deep!  Got me home fine, and ran
a long time that way, with me using HIGH TEST!
