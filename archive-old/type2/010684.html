C'mon you guys!

There's got to be a good way to do this. I got one response about a type of clamp with only one bolt on one side. Any other 
ideas? I'll look for one of those, meanwhile

snip&gt;&gt;The clamps that hold the muffler to the exhaust tubes, (you know the compressed
material ones with the two hemispherical peices held together with 2 long bolts)
end up sitting directly on the seam of the engine support beam. Try as I 
may, I can't get the darn things on. Anyone have a suggestion? What if I 
remove the bolt holding the engine to the support beam to the engine and then 
jack the engine up slightly to get a little room in there? There's only about
 1/4&quot; in there now which isn't enough for the clamp!
