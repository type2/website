Subject: RE: bolts in head

If you have access to a mig welder (and/or his/her equipment) you can try
this: Get yourself a piece of thick walled square steel tube stock (from a
welding shop) with an inside diameter a little bigger than the stud. Cut a
slot in the side of the square tube at one end about a 1/4&quot; wide and as long
as what's left of the stud. Slide this piece over the stud and weld it to
the stud all along both edges of the slot (the slot is so you can
effectively join the tube to the stud). If you've done a good job, two
things happen: You've turned the slippery, round stud into an easy-to-grip
square piece of steel, and you've heated the stud VERY nicely, helping to
break the corrosion bonds which prevent the thing from turning. Put a wrench
on it and see if it'll turn. Works about 60% of the time, if everything is
done properly.

Good luck!
