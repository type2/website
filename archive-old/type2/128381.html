&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I'm running ad dual port 1600 with a 34PICT 3 in a 69 bus and I can't
get it to Idle. It behaves like a vaccum leak but I'm almost posetive
that everything is sealed. I'm considering rebuilding or replacing the
carb. I wan't to fix it right and for good and I don't mind spending a
little money. any advice on the best way to go??

Wiggle the throttle shaft.  Most original carbs of this age have a shaft
that is pretty wiggly and which will let air in intermittantly.

They can be rebushed by folks like RIMCO
