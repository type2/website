&gt; Speaking of Don, that new pic on your profile is
&gt; awesome. Can you send me a full size copy?


Full size isn't much bigger than that. It's on my website too. I only
made it for my avatar on The Samba.

I'd been on the fence about the name for my bus. Since my handle for
years has been &quot;DurocShark&quot;, and I kind of have a thing for sharks, it
only made sense to name it - Great White. It's big and white. LoL! So
I went looking for that pic to merge my bus into. Found it, about 300
pix across, on a poster website. Photochopped in my bus and voila!

Also, I've finally started updating my site... Go have a lookesee:

To get back on topic:

I can't recommend the clear lenses. I have the Brazilian stock style
lenses and the clear portions yellowed in just a few months. Smoked
ones might be ok, since the yellowing would be much less noticable..
