Hi, everyone,

For those looking for canvas for the type IIs/Vanagon, I found a guy 
in Texas that makes kits in over 100 colors.  He sent me a color 
brochure within a few days of my call to him.

I plan to order a kit for my 1971 Campmobile in a custom color ($299 
+ $7 S&amp;H).  Standard colors are tan or light gray and cost $249 for 
my model.

He has all kinds of kits including 67 and earlier through the Vanagon.
  He also sells the rear door screen ($59.95). canvas cot ($49.95), 
child's cot ($49.95) and curtain sets (among other things).

Send a Self-addressed two stamped envelop to:

VW Canvas
101 Hillcrest
La Vernia, TX  78121

Phone is (210) 779-2136.

I met a guy at a show who had installed this kit and it looked great. 
 And, no.  I don't work for this guy.

Scott
