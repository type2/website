Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy firewall removal?

Oh yea! Been there, done that! You need an ohm meter or a battery powered
continuity tester. Connect one test lead to the terminal you removed the guage
wire from. Connect the other lead to the metal part that holds the sender in
the gas tank or the ground lug if it has one. Very slowly move the float from
one end to the other. If you are using an ohm meter you should see the reading
increase/decreace in proportion to the position of the float. Observe carfully
that the meter never goes to infinity, if it does you have a bad spot. If you
use the continuity tester, the light should stay lit and/or the buzzer should
keep sounding no matter the position of the float. If the light or buzzer quit
as you slowly move the float you have found a bad spot.


  Is there a way to test the fuel sender when it is out? I have mine out now
  and would like to check it before I reinstall it.
