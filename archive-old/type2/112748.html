Subject: pushrods

I hope to get my 79 GE engine in and running this weekend but am
confused about Bentley's description of my pushrods.  It says on a 78
and 79 they should be solid steel, not tubular.  Mine feel pretty heavy
but are tubular in that they have a tiny hollow from one end to the
other.  I assume this is for oil to travel to the rocker arms.  Do I
have the wrong pushrods on this engine? please forgive the many
questions I've asked but this is my first experience with an FI engine
and hydraulic lifters.  tx, Greg
