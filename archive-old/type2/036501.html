Subject: Re: need CV boot bolt spacers

Did my CV's yesterday.  The new boot kits do not come with washers.  I had to
reuse my old ones on one side. On the other side I had didn't have any.  So I
just used regular washers.  Time will tell if it works.

&gt; I just checked up under my Westie and noticed the &quot;highly qualified
&gt; mecanics&quot; who replaced my CV boots neglected to replace the spacers that go
&gt; under the CV bolts on the drivers side. Of course, the passenger side has
&gt; them in place.   So, I need six of these spacers. Anyone out there save
&gt; theirs from their last CV boot repacement job?
