Subject: heat exchanger

Hi, I am in search of to things.  The first one is an item, the second is
information.  I need a heat exchanger or pair of exchangers for a 1973 type
IV 1700 motor.  They only have to have solid tubing.  I do not care about
the sheet metal outside because I am converting them to J pipes.  The info I
need is about a pair of Weber 34's I am installing on the same 1700 motor.
These Webers have separate cables from each carb going into a 90 degree
aluminum bracket which has a pivot to hold both the indivdual carb cables
and the accerator cable.  It has a hole and bolt on one end.  Does this bolt
onto the motor or in the engine compartment.  Can anyone help me?  

Thanks Brian
1974 Transporter with soon to be 73 motor
