In the last few weeks, I have put HeatShield in my van.  It is a soft 
recycled cottony fiber (but dense) with an aluminum layer on one 
side.  This stuff is VERY easy to work with (scissors, utility knife and 
alum. tape for the seams)

I put a layer with the alum. facing outside in the walls, sliding door and 
on the floor.  (I had to use just a tiny bit of spray adhesive for the 
layer in the walls, just to tack it up.)  I also put a layer of R-9 insul. 
with the alum. facing in, in the walls.  I then placed a 4.5 ml vapor 
barrier over the walls before I put the wall panel back up.  I placed wall 
to wall carpet over the Heatshield on the floor.

I know get a thud instead of a &quot;ting&quot; when I shut the doors.  The 
Heatshield came in a 4'X6' roll from JCWhitney.  I paid $19.95 a roll on 
sale.  If you do order this...order it over the phone, because the web site 
NEVER reflect the sale prices (regular price is $24.95.)

I just recently bought 2 more rolls, to replace the insul. in the top 
portion of the engine compartment and to line inside front of the nose 
behind the kick panels.

Just my $.02
