Subject: re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob's tome

The principle of a Hydraulic lifter is to adjust the loading so it is in
the MIDDLE of its range of motion, allowing for both wear and stretching
due to heating.  I once measured the piston range and it was at least
2mm as I recall; the 2 turns puts this in the middle.  Too few turns and
you risk the piston slapping the snap ring (don't see how this could
cause valve seat hammering), and too much, the piston can bottom out or
not let the valve fully seat.  As I said before, I question that an
AIRBOUND lifter can prevent a valve from seating completely, as air
compresses, and you feel a &quot;squishy&quot; rocker; to me this would result in
a valve not opening enough.

The 1.5 turns logic is so: too much and the lifter could bottom out, too
little and the valve seat will get hammered. Without anyone providing
data
through experiment at both extremes, 1.5 became the magic number. A
quiet
valve train and good compression seem to bear it out.
