Subject: fuel tankage?
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19991020211321.0092d5b0_at_students.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

i was having some troubles with my 69 westy over the summer with the engine
losing power and cutting out at highway speeds, bucking at the same speeds
and so forth.  examination of my fuel filter has shown me that there is a
whole lotta crap in the tank.  seems like the filter gets pretty dirty in
about 300-500 miles (the van sat with little use for about 12 years before
i started driving it during warm weather 5 years ago) .

since its in the garage for the winter, i have been thinking about pulling
the gas tank out and cleaning it or having it cleaned by someone else.  i
have the POR-15 catalog, and it shows a &quot;auto fuel tank repair kit.&quot;  its
49.95 and basically contains a degreaser (tank clean), metal ready, and us
standard tank sealer.  i have a vw trends article showing how they did, and
it seemed to work ok.  

has anyone out there tried this stuff or something similar?  the tank just
needs a good cleaning, it doesnt leak or anything like that.  would i be
better off taking it somewhere to have this done?

thanks.
