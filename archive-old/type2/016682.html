Subject: Shift Rod Boots Found!

Volks;
Many of you had asked me to forward info on my quest for the ellusive
shift rod boot.  Well, I'm happy to report that they have been found!
Just Kampers of the U.K. has them in stock.  Not quite an exact replica
but perfectly functional.  I would suggest you fax in your order as I
had some difficulty with delivery due to miscommunication over the
phone.  The price was just under $20 including shipping and should take
about 1-2 weeks to arrive.  The URL is :
