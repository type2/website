72 upright 1600. (I'm in the UK)
A friend of mine has replaced my missing flaps and thermostat setup (Thanks again Andy), unfortunately he was missing the thermostat bracket, thermostat and rod. The rod and 'squirrels accordian' (I love that!) are no problem as most suppliers have them. I am not so sure about the bracket though. Anyone any ideas, does VW still stock them, do any of the UK suppliers stock them or failing that, has anyone got the dimensions so that I can make one?

Thanks
Mike
