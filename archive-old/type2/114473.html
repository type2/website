I did a TransVair kit in 87 on a 77 bus with a rebuilt 64 140 hp spider on a
slush-a-matic transaxle. I had added the  fan belt protector/guide and super
fan and bearing set with a Holly 450 carb into a four point manifold. The
heater tunnel adapters slipped right into place and the added cable hooked up
like the instructions said. Got right up and wrinkled the tires. Ended up
selling it to a guy on the east coast who used to work as the gasket repop for
Clarks Corvair. Peppy little van, too bad it wasn't a camper otherwise I would
have kept it.

With risk of being flamed, I still say that one should consider the
Corvair engine / tranny swap as a legitimate alternative to building up
a Type II or even a Type IV engine. About the same amount of money will
be spent beefing up a VW engine as will be spent doing the Corvair swap.
The two best flavors of the Corvair engines for VWs were the 94 HP and
the 110 HP. They have the nice torquey low end that busses need.
Displacement on the later model Corvair engine is 2.7 liters. That
horizontally opposed air cooled flat 6 is one smooth motor.
