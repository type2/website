&gt;&gt; Dr. Tim has the best point yet.
&gt;&gt; The best fire fighting system in the world
&gt;&gt; is a system that prevents the fire from starting.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I've never heard of a bus catching fire that didn't involve old fuel hoses
&gt;&gt; breaking, or the brass fuel inlet pipe falling out of the carb???
&gt;&gt; Fix it first, and don't worry about Halon systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a type IV engine catch fire when the cold start valve malfunctioned
&gt; and continued dumping fuel into the engine, fire started in the air box,
&gt; spread to rest of engine compartment, (engine continued to run) was in
&gt; Downtown DC and people on the street alerted me, fortunately my fire Ext
&gt; and someone who stopped put the fire out quite quickly.  insurance paid
&gt; for the repairs and I was back on the road in less than a week, next to
&gt; mine in the dealers yard was another FI engined VW that was totaled by
&gt; fire.

I figure it's better to be safe than sorry. Yes, change your fuel hoses
every year. Yes, run your fuel lines through a bulkhead fitting like Hoover
says to. And use a metal fuel filter bolted to the body so it won't shake
loose, double up your hose clamps, tap your brass fuel inlet pipe in
regularly--hell, thread the place it goes into and a pipe to fit, and screw
it in.

Given all that, remember that s*** still happens--fixed fire suppression
systems are still a good idea. If you have the thing 40 years and it never
discharges once, it was still a good investment.
