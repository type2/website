Subject: gas tank dimensions
Message-ID: &lt;3727B01F.5C51_at_penn_dot_com&gt;

The dimensions of the fuel tank in a 1978 van are as follows:
	36 1/2&quot; long
	14&quot;  wide       
	10&quot; thick (about)
        These measurements include the edge flanges but exclude the 
	spouts and vents.

Good fueling.
