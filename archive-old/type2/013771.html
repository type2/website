Mike:

If you're in no hurry, take Highway 1, especially from Monterey on.  You'll pass Pebble Beach, Carmel, Point Lobos, Big Sur, etc...

If you happen to be in the Bay area during the last weekend of July, the city of Gilroy has their annual Garlic Festival.  If you like garlic, this can't be missed.  P-mail me if you need any details about places to stop, or the Garlic Festival.
