I'm still working on the CSS layout of the site so it's still a little 
rough.  But you can see pics of the campout from 2002 at 
http://calivw78_dot_com/wordpress/wp-gallery2.php?g2_itemId=734.  Like many 
have already said, the crazy stuff happens late into the night ;)  This 
campout rocks when it comes to hanging out with the family and having a 
good time.  Too bad we missed it this year.

Peace...

Troy
