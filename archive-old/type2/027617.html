Subject: battery bracket?

I think I heard the bolt in the battery tray I had put in a year ago on my 
71 westy is for some sort of strap or bracket to hold the battery, which I 
don't have. My battery always slides around, making loud noises and me 
nervous. Anyone know where i can get such a bracket/strap?
wink
71 westy, &quot;Julie&quot;
