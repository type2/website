Subject: Re: seeking bus skeleton/art project

Good Morning Kynd Folk, such a beautiful sky there is arising out of the
darkness. :o)

I DID major in art in college, so as an art proposal I am wanting to put out
an all points bulletin, that I am looking for a FREE RUSTED UP BURNT UP
SHELL OF A BUS, this thing can be just a literal SKELETON, I really want to
get one because I'm making a sculpture in my front yard with the bus halfway
sunk into the ground.
It will also serve as a cool hideout for my birds I have around here.

I live in KANSAS........and I DO have means of towing the bus.
Just gimme an email if anyone knows of one close to me at all.
Or perhaps close enough we can get it here somehow.

Thanks everyone for listening to my morning ART PROPOSAL.

Peace,
Sunshine
