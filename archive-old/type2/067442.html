In my continuing saga of trying to &quot;throw away&quot; my Vanagon, I have been
getting the vast majority of calls asking variations of the &quot;Is it a
camper?&quot; question. I have regressed to the point of saying that it could be
camped in (sitting upright in the seats). ;-)

A good and funny call came in the other night from a fella who &quot;knew&quot; about
them Whist-phillies. &quot;Mom-an-nems had one back home.&quot;  He promised to come
over right after all the trick or treaters were in bed. I am still waiting
and it's Friday night...

I *SWEAR* that as soon as I piss this bus away there will be a flood of
folks saying that if I only had told them about it that they certianly
woulda bought it and woulda given more money than what I took. I'm about to
burn this B*tch just to get rid of it. It doesn't need *jacksh....* to drive
it for a long time. Absolute perfect for the student or family. I will even
mess it up if you want body damage and rust. Right now it has neither! It's
so nice and complete that we even considered blowing out the '83 aircooled
Westy and keeping it ourselves.
If anyone who's serious wants to see pics of it (the '80 7 psgr) I can send
them as attachments on Monday. Please specifiy Uuencode, Mime, etc.

Am I nuts? Do you list members think that I am nuts for trying to get
$2300.00 out of a rust free, undamaged, intact, nicely interiored, perfectly
driving '80 Vanagon? What are these things worth in your part of the world?
I am exasperated!
