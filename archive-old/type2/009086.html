Hi everybody!

It's time to replace what is left of the engine  compartment seal in the '69
bus. The motor is the original stock 1600spsr setup. I purchased the seal
&gt;from Bus Depot and I am ready to do this but am unsure about a few things.
First the seal is in 3 parts. Two of the seals are the same length and are
split. The other is shorter and without the split. I took a look at what is
left the seal(s) that are in situ (man they are shot) and It appears that
one of the long ones goes around the rear tin(front is front of bus ) and
the other goes around the front tin. Where does the short piece go? 

On the '72 the type4 seal is a breeze to install. I looks a little more
involved in the upright in the '69. Would you recomend removal of the rear
valance or even the engine in order to remove that remains of the old seal
and to install the new ones. 

It will be dark soon and the engine is still a little warm from the commute
home so I will tackle this job tomorrow. Any advice would be appreciated.
