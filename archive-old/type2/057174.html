Subject: Re: Timing marks on '81 Westy

&gt;RMMW, for instance, calls the
&gt;flywheel seal the &quot;rear&quot; and the other the &quot;crankshaft, fan end&quot;. Seems
&gt;logical to me to refer to parts the same way VW does, otherwise
&gt;confusion reigns. It's also fairly logical, if, when you are looking
&gt;into the engine compartment from the hatch, to refer to the stuff
&gt;farthest away as at the *rear* of the compartment, or *rear* of the
&gt;engine.

RMMW is not going to stay up late writing you messages about how to fix
your recalcitrant bus. Things situated further toward the nose of the bus
are &quot;front&quot;, things further toward the tailpipe end are &quot;rear&quot;. This is the
way we've done it for years and it's the only way to keep everything
straight.

It can lead to point-of-view peculiarities (things that are closer to you
can be &quot;behind&quot; things that are farther away) but this phrasing is only
unusual, it is not irrational.

Otherwise confusion reigns. There are several hundred megs of archives
written with this protocol and if you try to change it now I suspect you
will be the only one talking your language.
