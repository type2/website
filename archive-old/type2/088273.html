Subject: Re: [T2] Are these tires  a potential death trap?




&gt; And the bus will drive much better with much less wander with better
tires.
&gt; Chris Mills in TN
&gt;

I second that. The bus I bought almost a year had passenger car tires,
2-ply, load capacity 850 pounds. Still they worked, sort of.

And judging by their appearance and treadwear had been doing service for
some time. But the bus had a soggy, squishy feel you would not believe.

New Michelin Agilises (Agililae?) fixed that. Now the bus by comparison
feels almost  like it is riding on rails.

Years ago I learned not to skimp on tires. Quality tires will more than pay
for themselves in extended wear. They will rarely need to be balanced. You
will be rewarded each to you drive your vehicle by the excellence of your
ride. It is the most important upgrade you can do.

Cheers,
