25N                             buildt 25th November

425  025  114  

UF  2513  42178  1205857

I believe the 425 is not listed, the 025 are seatbelt anchors and 114 is for
six pop out side windows. Also my engine #0300727 I'd like to know what
size, year or any other helpfull info.
- - - - 

I think 425 is the code for US specs
UF - imported to US at port F (?)
2513      is the body code - deluxe bus LHD DD R i think, w/o looking it up

The engine number is inaccessible to me as my cat (Foam Unit!) is anchoring
me, look it up in the Idiot Book
