Subject: Nosecone removal

Joe,

Bustedbus' post stated that the tranny had to be removed. This is probably smart for the do-it-yourselfer, but I will tell you that after losing R,3,4 last week, My mechanic suggested the same part fix.

My mechanic put the bus up on a lift, disco'd the linkage, and was able to move the tranny enough to replace the part without dropping the tranny.

3 hrs labor, 5.00 part.

Improvement? Amazing, better than I expected.

Billy

I have a '78 Weekender that will not shift. There is some leakage at the nosecone. I purchased a &quot;hockey stick&quot; bushing in the hopes that this is all that it is. Questions are:

1. Can I remove the nosecone without dropping the tranny?
