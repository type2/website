Subject: Parking Brake

Good Morning List,

     I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me out with a
parking brake problem.  I have a 72 and you need to adjust underneath by
holding the slotted cables and turning a nut.  Well I did this, with the
parking brake pulled out six inches.  I did not have good results.  I
either got both tires locked up and could pull the brake or one tire
locked up when the brake was pulled.  So now I am thinking I need to
adjust the rear drums.  Has anyone had problems with trying to adjust
the parking brake?  Is adjusting the rear drums going to solve the
problem?

Thanks Dean

P.S. Does anyone happen to have any extra engine tin they may want to
get rid of.  I'm looking for the rear left  engine tin, used on a 1972
to 1978. The part number is 021-119-527CU.  I am also looking for the
warm air duct on the lower right,  used on a 1972 to 1974, 1980 to
1983.  The part number is 021-119-356CU.
