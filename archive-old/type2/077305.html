Subject: Re: [T2] Weird wire under dash in my 79 Westy

&gt; The healight swtich needed replacing so, as I was looking under there and
&gt; swtiching wires over to the new swtich, I noticed a wire that had been taped
&gt; off and left under the dash near the headlight switch. It is a sky blue
&gt; color with two lime green stripes on it. I can't find anything showing this
&gt; wire. Does anyone know where it's supposed to hook up to? It has the really
&gt; small push on connector on the end, only about 1/8&quot;, so won't fit the usual
&gt; size spades.

where does the other end go??
