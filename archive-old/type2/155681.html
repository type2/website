Subject: The Guac goes to California, v2.0

Yep. Yet another family issue (my mom was diagnosed with several cancers)
has prompted me to make another drive to CA.

The plan as it stands is to drive out on the 14th, hopefully to arrive on
the afternoon of the 16th. I'll stay a month, commuting from Garden Grove to
Rancho Cucamonga so I can keep working. (This is still tentative, but
likely.)

Since I'll be commuting 100 miles per day, on the oh-so-lovely 91, I need to
track down some parts this week. Things that aren't a big deal here, but
will be there.

1978 bottom tin: Since I'm rarely stuck in traffic here in CO, I didn't
worry about that. But since I'll probably spend a month sitting in hot
traffic I need them. Both sides.
Front shifter bushing.
Shift plate (possible... it feels worn)

I'm gonna see what BustedBus has. If anybody in CO has the stuff, let me
know. Hopefully I can tackle it this weekend. Remember: No changes to bus
immediately before a road trip! Drive a few days around town first!

=)

So, any shows or gatherings in SoCal the last half of this month through the
first half of August?
