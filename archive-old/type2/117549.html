Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

&gt; Has anyone ever tried those LED cluster bulb replacements for tail
&gt; light bulbs?  They are supposed to be brighter and turn on faster.

I'm working on it

&gt; Autozone has them for $16.00 a pair.  Are they worth it? The rear
&gt; lights on my 71 could use more brightness.  Do you have to make any
&gt; changes, other than the bulbs, to use them?

no the cheap ones won't work right.  I am working with the heavy duty
units for buses and trucks, figure 30-50 dollars, plus some cut and past,
as soon as I get it figured out I will post details
