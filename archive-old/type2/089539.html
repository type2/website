Subject: fridge replacements?

Was just cruising a mess of RV sites and manufactures of 12V fridges.  
Was noticing that there are quite a few out there and they seem to be a 
lot more efficient to use.  has anybody here ever replaced the fridges 
in their vanagon/westies with a newer model?  As I have already had to 
disconnect the gas to mine a straight 12v is okay to me.
