Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Very Intermittent Loss of Power


I have had nothing but bad luck with the Pertronix units. IMHO (slowly
learning list lingo) the Pertronix units are junk. I use the Allison
Ignition units now and have not had one problem. I think Allison units are
now sold under the Crane Cams name, vendors could help here. The Allison
unit uses a heavy duty box and I believe has an optical sensor verses the
magnetic Pertonix unit which typically has trouble supplying enough juice
to ge the job done.
     I'm no engineer, I can only speak for the VW's I' ve put these units
in. A good friend of mine is a Citroen mechanic and he swears by the
Allison units and curses the Pertronix...

&gt;If the loss of power events return, then I'll go after the air
&gt;control/electrical components.

In your original post you said you were all stock except for a Pertronix.
Don't rule out the posibility that it is causing your problem.  I
experienced a
really wierd intermittent problem on my 73 (dying when cold) for a year and

tried a LOT of different things to fix it.  I Finally removed the Pertronix
and
the problem is now gone.  Not saying this is your problem, but it is pretty

easy (and cheap) to swap back in the points/condensor and check it out.
