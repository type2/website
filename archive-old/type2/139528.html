&gt; I am curious as to what your opinion is on painting tin, I was thinking
&gt; about painting my fan shroud and cylinder head tin pieces and such with
&gt; super high temp paint.

Like the other 2 replies stated. The tin is there to direct the air where
it needs to go and heep some of the radiant heat from the exhaust from
drifting up into the engine bay. It doesn't get all that hot.

Pick a color, any color. Paint it with a good auto paint using proper prep
techniques for a long lasting finish or clean it and spray it with
Krylon(tm) if you don't mind repainting every year or two.

Pull it all and take it somewhere for powdercoating for a finish that's
pretty much permanent.

Getting it chromed would probably be a bad idea. I think it would reflect
way too much heat back at the heat sources -- but the discussion about
chrome tin is pretty much a &quot;religious war&quot; that should be avoided.
