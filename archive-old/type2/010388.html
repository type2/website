Are ['71 single cabs] different than normal bus ones and if so, does 
anyone know who carries them?

	YES, they're different, the square corner of the bed carries
down to the tuck-under of the sides and back. Quite unlike a stock
bus butt :) You CAN get a repair battery tray, but my impression
is that it doesn't fit well, and though I found three at two
different prices all of them turned out to be the same chunk of
metal.
	I'd save money and get the stock repair tray since you'll be 
fabricating anyway. The exterior sheetmetal you'll have to have made 
or find a donor- I'd think new would be better here.

	YMMV
