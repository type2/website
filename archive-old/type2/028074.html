There are beetle engines; then there are bus engines. In pre-68 buses, and maybe even up to '70, the two terms could be used synonymously. But '71-on engines, I know (and I *think* 68-70 as well), required bracing in the back of the engine. 

True Beetle engines did not include the mounting points for the rear &quot;engine hangar.&quot; What you need is a 1600 universal case (AE series, dual-oil pressure relief). You may want to search the archives to find the source for the tinware you need to install a 1600 in a later bus. I think it's also available through the Bus Depot.

I am not certain, but I imagine the Beetlemex engines are universal case engines. $1000 for that engine; $250 for exhaust; $350 for euro-tin. These are guesses.

Have fun! Joe
