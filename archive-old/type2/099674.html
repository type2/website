I never cease to be amazed by the number of people who *want* an
old VW, yet think they are.....entitled.....to zip around as if it were a new
BMW coupe, or some SUV with a ten liter, turbo-charged, engine.

Increasing engine size also requires an increase in the brake system--
the factory always did so--but few owner/improvers do.....it's still
on my &quot;to do&quot; list.  This is one of the reasons I keep my speed down,
in the bus.  (The bug, though it has only improved carburation and
exhaust, HAS been upgraded to front disc brakes--stops really quick.)

Even with a 78 x 88 type1 engine, improved carburation and exhaust,
and a CDI--the bus *really likes* to go 54mph.  I often go 60 - 65 when
need be, but I can tell that it isn't all that happy about it.

In a big hurry?  Perhaps a little Japanese car would be more pleasing.
When you've got a little time, hop in the bus, and see the road from
the right lane.
