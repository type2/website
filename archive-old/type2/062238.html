&gt; I recall that both offered a &quot;Deluxe&quot; top with windows on the side panels
as
&gt; well as in the end panel, and that one company did 'em with velcro 
&gt; while the other used zippers, but I seem to have misplaced all my old
&gt; brochures, so I can't tell which was which. I think CA had zippers.

VW Canvas in TX is the one with the zippers...very nicely done.  I  love
mine.
