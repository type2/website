Hello again list,

   Well I am happy to say I got my bus running. However no that she is 
running there are a few things I have discovered.

1) No Reverse. If I am not mistaken the reverse is down and all the way 
left. At least that's what the sticker on the ashtray says. I cannot seem to 
get her in reverse. Any Ideas?

2) In the process of installing the new ignition switch I seem to have 
screwed up the turn signals. Does any one have the proper wiring diagram for 
this? I am sure I have plugged something in wrong.

3) When driving down the road she seems to pull to the right. Especially 
when I put on the breaks.

Once I get this taken care of hopefully I can get her tagged and on the 
road. Any help the members of this list can give is very much appreciated.

Best Regards,

Joe
