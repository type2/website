&gt; Been running the Tiger 581 CDI, Pertronix Ignitor, and Bosch +4 Plat. plugs 
&gt; for almost two years now ( 33,581mi) on my ' 78 2.0L FI Westy. I had access 
&gt; to a chasis dyno at the time I did the swap-over from stock ign. parts. 
&gt; Gained a total of  4.87 rear wheel hp.( _at_ 4278 RPM) 9.73ft. lbs of torque,( _at_ 
&gt; 2970RPM) and about 3.1mpg avarage,( Stock eng.,  82,000mi., original.) with 
&gt; the new components.

I'm glad that you saw an improvement.  The question is, what caused the
improvement?  Few people do this sort of conversion start with a fresh,
well-adjusted stock ignition.  I'd venture that a fresh plugs would result
in pretty much the gains you cite over worn plugs.

Also, was it the Pertronics, the CDI, or the plugs that resulted in the
gains cited?  It's hard to figure out what is going on when you change
more than one thing at a time.

&gt; Was it worth it? To me, hell yes. No tune ups. Change the 
&gt; plugs every 60k miles or so. Never check the advance again. No hassle starts 
&gt; at -10f. More Torque, no points bounce, mis-fires or weirdness associated 
&gt; with a Kettering Ignition System.

I must be charmed.  I've never experienced those symptoms with points.
The electronic systems are clearly superior in performance, but the points
aren't as bad as many make them out to be.  The big advantage, IMO, is
that they can be easily fixed if they go south, an important consideration
if you venture to places where AAA won't go.

&gt; Will the 200.00 price tag buy you a butt 
&gt; load of points and condensors? Yup. Is it worth it to almost NEVER have to 
&gt; jack with my Ignition System?  To me, with a business, wife, two kids under 
&gt; four, and a Westy that is my Daily Driver, all I can say is , Hell Yes.( And 
&gt; thank GOD for Hydro. Lifters!!!)

I'm pretty much in the same position, but I've found that the &quot;no
maintainance&quot; solutions have, in the long run, resulted in fewer small
hassles (like valve adjustments) and more big hassles (like
hydraulic lifter problems)  I'm willing to deal with the small stuff in
order to be assured that the bus will get me to my destination.

I suppose that it's a matter of philosophy.  I'm glad that we're both
happy with ours.

George
