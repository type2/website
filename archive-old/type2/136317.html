Subject: Describe this emotion..... and some help.

So its I actually pulled it out of the garage.  The
kids didn't know the garage was so big, ut it's
leaking oil from the flange where the heat exchanger
connects to the muffler.  Where is it coming from?  I
am also seeing white smoke from the muffler.  So I'm
happy, but dreading what this problem may really be.
