Subject: clues-56 r  156K miles

Suggestions on figuring out 56K or 1566K bus:  It's a consensus of the
following- note that wear clues on the bus would be more reliable than
figuring out the engine, which may have been rebuilt 60K ago...
1.  Look at the bus- Are the tires old?  Feel the play in the engine hatch
lid- was it opened a lot?  Open the jalousies on both sides half way and
then try to lift one by hand- is it tight or has it 1/2&quot; or so of up/down
play?  Is the gear tight when rolling the window up and down?   Is there a
lot of play when you take a wiper arm and move it up and down?  Does the
windshield look like it had 156K of grits flying at it?  Jack up a rear
wheel and move the wheel forward and back- this checks differential play.
Should be tight (1&quot; vs 2&quot;!!).  In-out play should be minimal.  Usually the
rear shoes are still original at 56K!!  Look at the the star adjustors
(peer in the port)- do the stars look all beat up or nice and new?  Pulling
a wheel drum will show if it's worn down a lot (156K), not much in 56K.
Consider pulling a CV axle and studying the balls/cage- 56k is not a lot of
wear (just shiny areas); pitting could be from sitting a long time if boot
was torn.  156K would show areas worn in on both the outer ring and the
inner hub.
2.  Look at parts that tend to wear with lots of use- the sliding door
track is a good clue- is the glider all worn in back or tight? Is there a
groove worn in the floor where the roller glides?  Is the driver seat all
worn from a butt sliding in a lot or pretty new with the piping still
intact?  Is there lots of wear on the surface of the clutch/brake pedal
covers or did someone just replace them?  Is the carpet worn from lots of
heel digging?  Pull the steering wheel and look at the tracks of the
contactor for signalling left/right- is it very worn?
3. Engine clues. A 56 K engine shouldn't be rebuilt before about 80K or
later.  Does the engine perimeter seal look original?  Does the fan belt
look old and cracked as an original might?
-I'd look at the mating surface-does it have recent sealing compound
sticking out (especially some other color than what I think was dark
brown?)  Do the nuts have wrench mark signs?  Did the shrouding screws come
off easy/show scoring from visegrips, etc, or did they still look new and
&quot;corroded&quot; in place with time?
-An engine that's original but so old should give clues- like the pushrods
seals would leak from age?  Do they look new?  You pulled the oil cooler-
an old one should still have original &quot;stuff&quot; blown over it by the fan?
-Pull the clutch- very easy- is it well worn (close to the rivets or shows
lots of depth?  Is the release plate ring (or fingers) rather worn from
lots of clutching?
-Pull the valve covers and look at the valves- when I bought my 75 bus with
&quot;60K&quot; miles, I was skeptical until I did that and noticed they looked like
a screwdriver had hardly been on them- remove some adjustors and look at
the ends- are they flattened, or nice and round?  Go a little further and
undo the rocker.  Then look at the warpy washer spacers- are they really
worn flat from friction or still thick at the bends?  Most rebuilders are
not likely to mess with this part.  Look at the valve ends-do they look
like they've been tapped for 156K?
-Try pulling the oil pump and looking at the gears- 156K would show lots of
scoring of the cover plate and quite a backlash on the gears.
-If you are pulling the jugs, check the rod play- is there too much side
clearance?  Did someone repeen the rod nuts?
I agree that 156K is a lot for an original engine, whose compression ought
to be 90 by then or less!  Thus if the body wear tests show not a lot of
wear, it's likley 56K.   I'd try to dig up some past history (many or few
owners, repair records, etc.
