15 powers the coil. You have to follow the current path that connect the fuses together.

The ignition switch gets it power from 30 which leads to a fuse S9 which comes goes directly to the battery. Bosch terminal 30 means (input from + battery terminal, direct) but you have to take fuses into account.
