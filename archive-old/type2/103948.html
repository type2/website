&gt; &gt; Hello to all bus pilots,
&gt; &gt; I have been kicking around an idea for a wind powered battery charger.
&gt; &gt; Being of the artistic bent I like to make windmills from found objects.
&gt; &gt; My idea is to build a mill onto a 38 amp bus generator with a regulator to
&gt; &gt; Does this sound possible?
&gt; &gt; What kind of rpm's do I need in order to generate a useable current?
&gt;
&gt;You will need about 4000RPM at the generator to make a reasonable amount
&gt;of current.  You're talking about a big windmill and a goodly amount of
&gt;gearing to make this work.
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I think that solar is more practical.  I don't like to camp
&gt;where it is windy!  :)

I have to AGREE with George on this one.
As a demonstration as to how much work it takes to generate electricity, I 
have an exercise bike set up at school with an alternator attached to 
it.  I use a 9V battery to separately excite it just to get it going and 
then switch it to self excited.

As a load, I have a lamp bank connected to it with 5 switchable 50W 12V 
light bulbs.  Its kind of fun to call out the class loud mouth and 
challenge him to light up all five bulbs.  Usually he gets to three bulbs 
and is huffing and puffing and can't quite get anywhere beyond three, maybe 
four for a few seconds.  Its quite a dramatic demonstration into power in 
and power out.

The real fun part of the demonstration is after they can't muster up the 
power to light up more than 3 or four  bulbs, they try and turn the tables 
on me with &quot;OH yea, lets see how many the teacher can light up&quot;  (expecting 
one or two, like some of their classmates).  That's where my keeping in 
relatively decent condition after all those years running pays off.  I 
quickly bring all 5 lights on line and then keep them on for about a 
minute.  They always walk away shaking their heads, convinced that I must 
have some &quot;trick&quot;

I have a 25 watt solar panel and you can get panels of much larger output 
capacity at a reasonable price.  Great for camping.  One thing about wind 
charger is that they are NOISEY.  All that rotating machinery makes lots of 
noise.  I think if one were to compare the cost of a 75 watt panel (under 
$300) vs the cost of a windmill, frame, pole to mount it on, guy wires, 
then add it the time to assemble, dissemble place to store it in the bus, 
pissing off neighbor campers with its constant noise, solar starts looking 
real good.
