Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; If you're familiar with wood-working tools (goes with having a Morgan...)
&gt; then you realize what a joke the &quot;Ridgid&quot; name on non-plumbing tools
&gt; is...Emerson Electric must have paid plenty to use it on a vacuum
&gt; cleaner.

From Ridge Tools' site:

&gt; Ridge Tool is a subsidiary of Emerson of St. Louis, Missouri. Emerson is a
&gt; global manufacturer with high-quality products, systems and services for
&gt; commercial, industrial, and consumer markets. With headquarters in St. Louis,
&gt; Emerson has more than 60 divisions selling products in more than 150
&gt; countries.

IOW, I don't think Emerson Electric paid very much to use the name on the
Home Depot tools. Besides, the Ridgid stuff is the same bad line Sears sold
for many years, until they decided to seek Taiwanese machinery. (Weird thing
is, the Taiwanese stuff Sears has now is better than the American machines
they used to carry.)
