Subject: Re: [T2] single port heads...and a strange speedometer thang...

&gt; also, a strange instrument panel thing...the gas gauge &quot;flickers&quot;...it does

Test it:

The one change I would make to the article would be to use 1W resistors or
larger. VW also recommends 1W:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dakhlia/images/VW-90.3.jpg

The reason is that I was testing a handful of voltage stabalizers the other
day and bad units caused the 1W resistors I was using to get very hot very
quickly.

FYI, good units (bi-metallic style) all gave similar readings but not
exactly the same as each other which I found interesting. If anyone needs
one because theirs is toast, pmail as I have a bunch from the junkyard that
I've tested.

&gt; the 
&gt; speedometer does the same thing....in the past i have seen speedometers do
&gt; that, as a result of a wore out dust cap...but this one seems fine...even
&gt; tossed a little jb weld on it to assure its stability...but it still
&gt; fluctuates maddeningly, bouncing from 45 to 70 when iam doing 55...so, must be
&gt; in the gauge itself, right? so, replacing the instrument panel seems the
&gt; logical thing to do...

The speedo cable turns a disc inside the instrument cluster. The disc rubs
against another disc attached to the needle. The coefficient of friction
between the two discs causes the needle to deflect based on the rotating
speed of the first disc.  When I discovered the mechanism by which it worked
I immediately wondered how the speedometer would behave once the disc wore
out.

Not sure what the problem is but I wanted to pass that info along.
