The spedo cable is in two pieces. Drop your spare and take a look.

That little box that connects to your spedo and has a button it as well
as connecting the spedo to the front wheel.

When your EGR light comes on and it will every 15,000 miles you press
that little button to reset it and in another 15,000 miles your EGR light
will come on again.
