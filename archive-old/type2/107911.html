Subject: Color of U-piece for sliding door hinge

Anyone know the correct color of the big U-piece that pivots outward on the
rear hinge of the sliding door on my '78 CE Westy?  The bus is being painted
and the bodyman noticed that the back side was silver and thought that might
be the original color rather than the white that was on the front side of the
piece.  It's possible that the white was sprayed on the last time it was
painted.  I haven't found any clear pictures of the piece in its original
form.

Thanks!
Brad
