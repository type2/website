Subject: Re: [T2] top end rebuild ?'s dear lord... =(

According to Those Who Know, honing cylinders and re-ringing is a Complete
and Utter Waste of Time.  Because of the horizontal layout of the engine the
cylinders tend to wear in an egg-shaped pattern and honing will NEVER get
them round again.  Besides, if you've only got 67K on the engine, unless its
been abused, it probably doesn't need it.  Have you had them do a
compression check yet?

&gt; &gt;Reality check - blowby will not be cured with a top-end rebuild!  Unless
&gt; &gt;their idea of a top-end rebuild includes honing the cylinders and
replacing
&gt; &gt;the rings.
&gt;
&gt; This is exactly what they mentioned doing, sorry for missing that part. Is
&gt; that not a typical part of a top end rebuild?
&gt;
&gt; With honing the cylinders and replacing the rings, along with rebuilt
heads
&gt; and labor, is this now a $1700 job?
&gt;
&gt; I haven't paid for anything yet, so they can round up the parts. While
they
&gt; might be pissed, I can still cancel this thing and go elsewhere if this
&gt; process sounds shady. I really like these guys, and they never pressed me
to
&gt; do this in the first place, just brought it up as an option.
&gt;
&gt; I think the re-ringing thing was what they wanted to do to fix the oil
leak,
&gt; but the rebuilding of the heads was what they mentioned I may want to do
&gt; while tackling this issue.
