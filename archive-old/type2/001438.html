Just a note to let you know that I now have repros of the rear tables used
in '74-79 Westies. This is the first time they've been available in 15
years.  They are the same look, wood grain, and dimensions as the original,
except that they lack the small fold-out leaf found on the original.  They
are available without an arm or mount for $99.95, or with both arm and mount
for $169.95.  The mount supplied is actually the later style (used on '85-up
Westies), and the arm is similar to the original except that it accepts this
later style mount and is brown power-coated rather than unpainted.  If you
would like to use the new table with a stock '76-79 arm that you already
have, you can purchase a functional mount at a hardware store for a few
bucks that will work with the original arm.
