Subject: Re: [T2] dansk heater boxes, rant

Fair rant, Dan, but it got me thinking about what to do about it.

I recall, from my distant past in the business world, that there's a 
guy in every company who is invested in making shoddy crap. If others 
in the company point out that it's crap, this guy invariably says &quot;we 
haven't gotten any complaints.&quot;

Somehow, you've got to get your complaint to this guy's boss (and cc'ed 
to the guy). You've already banged up the heat exchanger, so you cannot 
return it. How about sending the company a bill for your fitting time 
(don't expect to collect).

The way to make that approach work is to find out some names: the name 
of the guy, the name of his boss, and the name of the person in 
accounts payable. The bill has to go to this third person as well. 
While the other two can ignore your bill, the accountant is going to 
freak, and will insist that SOMETHING be done with your bill.

Whether you go to the retailer with the same complaint or not, I don't 
know. Probably.

The danger in this approach is that Dansk isn't committed to making 
these parts, and will just cease producing them rather than make an 
effort to make them better.

Mark &quot;I'll caveat your emptor&quot; Hineline
