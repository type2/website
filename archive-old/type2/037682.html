Subject: Timesert/Bigsert tap or installer in Boston area? 

Hello,

I'm hoping to find a timesert or bigsert kit in Boston
area to &quot;rent&quot;, or a person or shop who will install a
 Timesert or bigsert for me. 

My heads are off (72 bus).  I've got the inserts, and
I'd be happy to do the work myself, but don't have the
insert kit.

Any help appreciated.  I'm in Wakefield, and can drive
another vehicle anywhere up to an hour or so of
Boston.

Thanks,

Shawn
