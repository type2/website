You can get LEDs with various light patterns.  Common designs either
focus light in a 10 degree cone or in a 30 degree cone.  For taillights,
the 10 degree varity is ideal, as any oncoming traffic from the rear will
be well within 5 degrees from the F-R axis of the vehicle.  If they are
more off-axis than that, you're not going straight down the road!

&gt; What I want is a set of taillights that naturally sit right at eye level for
&gt; truckers and 4WD folk, don't require an cosmetic change to the bus, and are
&gt; easily removed.

Sounds like you want the LED bar at the base of the rear window  You
could also go with LEDs on the luggage rack if you run one.
