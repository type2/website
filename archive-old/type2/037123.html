Subject: Re: por 15 primer report

I painted parts of my bus with por-15 after I sandblasted all the rust
away.  The main parts were the window sills.  I've only brushed the stuff
on, but it does seem to be a good filler in the pitted areas.  Also, I
started to sand blast the nose &amp; paint that with por-15 also.  It looks
really nice so far &amp; I'm a picky person.  I personally found the foam
brushes to work better than the bristle ones.  The foam brush put a smooth
finish on &amp; the bristle ones seemed to leave 'streaks'.

Soon to be workin' on the bus again,
