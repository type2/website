&gt; The other week, I had just finished tuning up the dizzy for my '67--
&gt; new points, condenser, cap, rotor, the works! -- when one of the clips
&gt; that holds the cap on came loose and dropped somewhere.  Given that I
&gt; have yet to find it, I doubt I will, so I'm stuck searching for a
&gt; replacement.  It's odd, because the other dizzys that I have all have
&gt; clips that screw on as opposed to just sticking into the bottom of the
&gt; dizzy.

Get one of those telescoping pen shaped magnets and probe around the dizzy
until you find it. IIRC they are held on with screws so that will be down
there also.
