Subject: Re: Where do I get a yellow fire extinguisher?


In addition to a fire extinguisher, I suggest welders gloves or similar. 
I had a Triumph TR-250 (Similar to TR-4 / TR-6) with a rear opening hood
that burned to the ground.  I had a fire extinguisher but could not use
it because the hood was too hot to open the second latch.  

I believe you might find the same with a bus, especially a vanagon.  I
keep a pair of welders gloves right behind the drivers seat along with a
fire extinguisher.  Yes, they might be awkward to use (perhaps I should
practice!), but I know from experience that the engine lid might be just
too hot to handle and then you are there with the extinguisher trying to
shoot in from the wheel wells.

If anyone has any other glove ideas - send them my way!
