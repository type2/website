Subject: [T2]  68 to 73 Westy Luggage rack questions

&gt; The PO of the 72 once removed the luggage rack to clean it. When it 
&gt; was reinstalled it was done crookedly. The PO told me it was a real 
&gt; bear to get the rack back on. I was thinking about pulling it off and 
&gt; trying to readjust it. Any thoughts?

I found my late '73 Westfalia luggage rack attached with sheet
metal screws.  Three screws in the back go through tall rubber
stand-offs.  The rubbers in the front are more like washers and
fit betw the steel roof and the fiberglass rack.  Try and line
'er up with the pop-up closed and resting on the rack.


&gt; Has anyone found stainless steel replacement for the luggage tie 
&gt; downs on the surrond the luggage rack?  ...

I think it's called an 'eye' or a 'pad eye'.
They are found on boats.  Try a marine hardware store.

Good luck,
