Sorry to hear that. No fun at all.

If that's a type IV motor, somebody fouled up on the assembly. Something
was not spec. Broken cranks are extremely rare with that motor, or any
other bottom end problems, unless it be at least a copla hundred thousand
miles with mediocre maintenance or oil starvation or other lubrication
system failure.

Bottom line is, you just can't know the extent of damage with a broken
crank without tearing down the motor for inspection and measures. Might
just need a crank and bearings or a rod, or could need a new case and most
hard parts replaced. Worst case is if the rod comes loose and drives it up
through the cam but that would be a LOUD &quot;KA-CHUNK-A!!!&quot; and oil spilled
through the cracks or holes in the case. 

Hope your dealing with a mechanic that stands behind his workmanship, or
lack thereof.
