Subject: Re: [T2] GWB with its top off

Hi Don,

Obviously you have never seen an east-coast bus. Or other vehicle.   
We drive them like that all the time..... except that out east it's  
the undercarriage that's rusting through. The rockers go first,  
followed by the battery tray, the sliding door track and the (final  
kiss of death) front beam.

Get on the bus (so to speak) and weld some metal. Or cave and pave,  
as Terry so eloquently puts it.  I've seen people get many a good  
year from a vehicle in FAR worse condition. YMMV.

If it were my bus I'd POR-15 the remaining metal and then use 3M  
autobody adhesive to attach a donor roof-skin over the existing roof.  
Or graft a 68-79 westfalia or sportsmobile/adventurewagen top on  
there in place of the high top.

Heck... THAT IS WHAT I DID!!

(except I used a welder... no-one told me about the adhesive)

Happy trails,

&gt; The pics don't really tell the tale. But the rust around where the top

&gt; Decision time. What to do?
