&gt;now I have to &quot;guess which one doesn't belong:&quot;
&gt; 

&gt; 1:  The wire to the condenser

that would be one of them

&gt; auxilary heater blower.  The white wire heads towards the front-right
&gt; of the engine compartment.
&gt; 

and that would be the other

&gt; 3.  A black wire coming out of the same loom as #2.  this wire has hot
&gt; current when the key is on and warms up the pos. coil connections when
&gt; 1,2 and 3 are connected at once.
&gt; 

should be +

&gt; 4.  A black wire with an in-line fuse coming from the left firewall.
&gt; 
also +

&gt; As noted, if I have the black wire (#3 above) connected with #1 and #2
&gt; on the + side of the coil, the heat would indicate that I am creating
&gt; a short.  
&gt;  Have I done any
&gt; potential damage to any components by hooking things up this way?
&gt; 
Not sure, but there is potential :-(
Hopefully the short was power from wire #3 being grounded through the
points, but that white wire goes to the brain. If you fried your brain,
that would be a bad thing.
