I just picked up Martha at the Airport this evening. She and Bradley both
looked tired and in need of a bit of rest after their flight from Zurich.

I expect that they'll both be back on line within a day or two and I'm sure
we'll be getting some of their trip notes.

Send 'em a hello when you have a chance.
