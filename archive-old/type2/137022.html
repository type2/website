Hahahahaaa, even worse!! California Import Parts is a CANADIAN company from
Langley B.C. with a drop ship warehouse in Blaine Wa. to beat the taxman.
But having said that, they are excellent to deal with whenever I have used
them, (mainly because they are about 30 miles away from me here on Vancouver
Island). However, I still cannot find ANYONE who can beat Ron Salmon's
service or prices at BusDepot.

&gt; The fact that they sell GEX engines is the reason I don't buy ANYTHING

&gt; from Cip1. That and why would a company in another state use

&gt; California in the name?!?!?! Makes one wonder...

&gt;

Maybe they were once actually based in CA. The more likely explanation is
the image/emotions they want to evoke from potential customer. CA after all
was the birthplace of the kewel cal look hot rod vw scene. Just muy guess
though.
