In response to my flame about selling 'free parts', Steven White wrote:

&gt;My old heaterboxes werent terribly rusted out or anything... if i am
&gt;expected to give the new ones away, i have lost the right to sell the 
&gt;oldones to someone other than vwoa.  In that case, i have paid 
&gt;VWOA for the new heaterboxes by giving up my right to sell the old 
&gt;ones.

My most sincere and humblest apologies to Steven.  In my self-righteous
haste, it never crossed my mind that the Le Coz thing was an exchange rather
than a give-away.  Of course it makes sense now that it has been pointed out
to me, but I've already flamed a fellow listee.  I hope anyone that read my
first post reads this one as well and doesn't think too poorly of me for my
mistake.
