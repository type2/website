&gt;Where can I find the resistance specs for the temp 2 sender on my '76

Go to the archives on type2_dot_com

Somewhere in the archives I did a study of the head temp sender in hot
oil calibrated against the average of 3 thermometers.  I don't have the data
anymore.  Would be about 1.5-2.5 years ago, searching likely for John
Anderson and head temp sensor.  Some books list the values at 3 points
in some manuals the one I have at hand says 68F at 2500 ohm, at oil temp
above 175F less than 300 ohm.  My curve also had freezing and continuous
data from 75F to 450F or so.  Regardless you want 2200-2500 at &quot;room
temp&quot; depending on how hot the &quot;room&quot; is and I distinctly recall
that under 25 ohms is WAY hot like you never want to see those
readings if the sender is OK.  The curve is exponential.

FWIW I don't think it makes much sense to &quot;check&quot; these anyway as
they are notoriously finicky compared to that wide VW specification.  If
you doubt it, it is cheap (under $20) just replace it.  If it is no
different or
doesn't change anything, you got a spare.  Buses tend to run with bad
sensors but run badly paticularly during warmup.  A common sympton is
start but no power, stalls upon trying to move, that may get better after
the bus idles (if it will) for 10 minutes.
