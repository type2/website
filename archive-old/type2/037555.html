Subject: westy vinyl source

the closest vinyl ive been able to find (yellow i assume) is Naugahyde
Spirit Millenium in Goldenrod US-324
try  http://www.fabricsbyous_dot_com/spiritmillenium.htm
they quoted me a price of around 13.50 a yard Id appreciate if anyone
finds either a closer match or better price to let me know.
This vinyl is a hair brighter and lacks the faux leather graining of my
original but its the best I could find.
