Subject: RE: [T2] Brake adjustment UPDATE

A properly adjusted p-brake will work just like the
one on your civic...sounds like you're not quite there
yet.  It's worth the trouble to do it right,
especially if you park on hills.

New cables are worth it too, that will get you a solid
brake with only a few clicks of the handle.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
I guess I am too used to the fact that I can pull the
parking brake on my
Civic, take it out of gear, and it stays put. Overall,
I am sure that at
some point in the future, new cables will be needed.
