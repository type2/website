Hey,
Didnt we have this same conversation the other day about heping strangers on
the side of the road. I remember we all went sadly on about the lack of
goodwill between folks nowadays. What harm to help? Lifts the vibe a bit and
everybody wins.

&gt; my $.02 would be to keep it public.   id help anyone
&gt; in need, especially if you have a bus.   it is after
&gt; all a listing of people willing to help, thats why my
&gt; name is on there.   if someone isn't lucky enough to
&gt; know about the type2 site yet, but somehow still gets
&gt; ahold of the list, so be it.  if they are a royal PIA,
&gt; then i wasted a little of my time.   on the other
&gt; hand, you could make someones whole trip, so to me it
&gt; would be worth it.   anyways if the individual turns
&gt; out to be a jerk, then my ability to help suddenly
&gt; becomes a lot less is all.   of course its only my
&gt; opinion so take it FWIW.   we all know me and my karma
&gt; philosophy so i tend to throw on the rose colored
&gt; glasses when i see someone in need, especially a bus
&gt; owner.

&gt; &gt; When the AIRS site first went up I expressed my
&gt; &gt; concern that it be
&gt; &gt; access limited. This is exactly why. So perhaps this
&gt; &gt; is a well meaning
&gt; &gt; guy who would be interested in helping others in
&gt; &gt; turn. But maybe not.
&gt; &gt; Neato doesnt publish the travel directory to non
&gt; &gt; members and I dont
&gt; &gt; think this should be either. Opinions?
