Subject: Re: backwards Bus

Those boneheads flopped the cover photo, sacrificing accuracy for
aesthetics. It's really fun to look for the backwards writing that the
editors didn't catch. D'oh!

&gt; I got my copy of the June 2000 DB&amp;Hot VW's and right on the cover of the mag
&gt; is a real nice picture of a 67 SO42 Westy pop top. However it is completely
&gt; backwards, righthanddrive, side doors on the left and the interior is
&gt; reverced. But then I open it up and it majicly switched back to a normal
&gt; Bus. What are those guys up to? I would sure love to have one like is on the
&gt; cover, what a RARE beast that would be here in the USA.
