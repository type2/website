Subject: Bleeding hydraulic clutch
Date: Wed, 3 Mar 1999 18:00:39 -0600

Hi volks!

Went out this morning to drive the '82 Westy and the clutch pedal goes
almost to the floor before it engages.  As a result, it won't fully release
the clutch.  This did not just happen overnight.  For the past 3 -4 weeks I
thought that the pedal freeplay was increasing.  Now I have proof :)  I
looked at the fluid resevoir and it is completely full.  After searching
the archives I'm hopeful that bleeding the system will fix me right up. 
What I couldn't find is the answer to this question:  Can this be done
without a pressure bleeder?  How?

Many TIA,
Erich Elmer
