Welcome to the family.  I too have a '78 Westy.  I had
my gas tank cleaned when I had my engine out for a
rebuild.  Removing the gas tank with the engine out
was very simple.  Not having tried to pull the tank
out with the engine installed, I'd say if it was
possible, it would be a complete pain in the ass.  If
it were easy, I'd pull my own out to replace the gas
guage sender, but I'm not up for that type of
punishment.  Since the bus is new to you, there are
several things you could do to while the engine is
out.  First and foremost, replace ALL of the fuel line
with high quality fuel line.  This is done much easier
with the engine removed.  I'd replace the fuel guage
sender too if you have the engine out.  I'd also check
the bird beak elbow as it's much easier to replace
with the engine out as well.  The bird beak elbow is
the piece of rubber the nozzle of the gas pump inserts
into when you fill 'er up with petrol.

I'm sure this was overwhelming, but I wanted to fill
your ear on the off chance you choose to have the gas
tank cleaned.  Maybe somebody on the list can confirm
if it's possible to remove the tank without removing
the engine.  I have removed the gas tank cover without
removing the engine for what its worth.

Good Luck

&gt; Brand new to VWs.  I just bought a 78 transporter,
&gt; cheap.  Now I know why.  It had been sitting for 5
&gt; or
&gt; so years with no gas in the tank.  The mechanic
&gt; looking at it found the fuel filter jammed with
&gt; rust. 
&gt; The tank probably is too. The mech said that removal
&gt; of engine is necessary to get to tank to take it out
&gt; to repair or replace.  Anybody care to confirm that?
&gt; 
&gt; I do not want to screw up the FI by getting rust
&gt; into
&gt; it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Any help is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Kindest Regards,
