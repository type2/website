Subject: [T2] sleeping arrangements Dormobile fashion

Travelling Monday for a month, part of Europe on a plate before us.
Thing is: 71 Dormobile, double bed downstairs.....taken by my lovely wife
and feeding/nursing 1 month old son.
Two bunks upstairs for myself and our two year old daughter ............you
might have noticed I said two year old....
still prone to rolling about in her sleep.
Any members got any tips on keeping a small child up there, as it is one
hellava fall !!!
Also, has anyone ever tried to merge those two bunks at night for the same
reason using cloth etc, etc.....
Any help appreciated
Garp
