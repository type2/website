Re: the following exchange between Scott and Ron:
&gt;   I am thinking about parting out my 73 Bus and was wanting to know if

&gt; the Exhaust(complete system) could be installed on my 77.

&quot;Yes, if you also swap out the heat exchangers.  The ports on the heads
are a slightly different shape, but the difference is small enough that
the  gaskets will make up the difference.&quot;

Ron, you are not referring to the rectangular ports, are you?  I think
they started in '79.  There, the difference is also the depth of the
ports in the heads, right?  What other difference is there between '73
and '77?

&gt;    The other Question is will the AFC's from a 411 or 412 fit or work
in a Bus?

&quot;I'm fairly certain they are not interchangeable - at least on the 411's
I've seen.&quot;

The 411/2 isn't AFC, I thought.  Isn't it the Pressure controlled fuel
injection, like the type 3 (D-Jetronic, where &quot;D&quot; is for the German word
for pressure, as opposed to L-Jetronic, where &quot;L&quot; stands for Luft,
right?).
