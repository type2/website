Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

So... You're saying my typical 65-75 cruising speed in my stock 73 is
a bad thing?

;-)

I know I should keep it down, but the bus is just so happy to run at
65! I try to do 55 and he starts creeping up without telling me! 75
takes just a wee bit of extra effort judging by the engine note.

I suppose that my tranny could be an aftermarket &quot;freeway flier&quot; type,
but I doubt it. Too bad there's no easy way to check without a tach in
the dash.

How come there are no cheap tachs?
