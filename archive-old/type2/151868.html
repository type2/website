Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp?

Phil.

Richard had my test report on these on his site at one point.

Basically, they have gross errors and the temps shown will change by 25C 
or so just by having them tilted in your installation rather than 
perfectly vertical.

Much better to pull the gauge and sender and do your own test and 
calibration in the oven....with a *good* digital gauge.

Otherwise, all bets are off and the numbers are just that....a reference 
point with no real meaning.

Cheers, dave
