&gt;Repost with subject of: RX7 Oil cooler the real skinny
&gt;Even after thoroughly examining the RX7 oil cooler that I 
recently
&gt;installed on my 83 Air Cooled Westfalia I still had some 
questions.
&gt;I contacted the RX7 group on the Internet that has expertise 
on the
&gt;generation three Mazda Rotary engine.
&gt;I have made a simple drawing of the functions of the RX7 
cooler.
&gt;http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/stanvan/portp.jpg
&gt;Apparently the Mazda generates over 100psi on cold morning 
startups and
&gt;runs at approximately 60 PSI at 3300 RPMs. The nature of the 
engine
&gt;requires a lot of oil flow and the cooler is designed to 
give un
&gt;obstructed flow at all operating temperatures and oil 
pressure levels.
&gt;The diagram is not to scale and valve porting is 
approximated in PSI.
&gt;I hope this is helpful to anyone considering the 
installation of this oil
&gt;cooler.
&gt;I have had pricing on these coolers at retail for as much as 
$700.00
&gt;(Mazda Dealer) $485.00 (After market) Thermostat $85.00
&gt;I paid $20.00 for my cooler with the lines.
&gt;Try to get the cooler with the lines. New Banjo Bolts $6.85, 
New copper
&gt;sealing washers $2.85 each, The large banjo hose connectors 
are expensive
&gt;and you need the ones on the lines.
&gt;I think this cooler is a viable solution to cooling down hot 
oil, I've
&gt;never gotten over 210 so far in the most adverse conditions 
of fighting
&gt;25 mph head winds on 85 degree days. The real test will be 
coming this
&gt;summer when ambient temperatures in Texas reach 110 and over 
100 for 30
&gt;consecutive days.
&gt;If you have a good functioning oil pressure gauge you will 
see a slight
&gt;bump on your needle as the cooler actuates at the specified 
pressure
&gt;porting points. They get this on Mazda as well.

or post to
&gt;vanagon_at_GERRY.VANAGON.COM , I am not on the type 2list.
