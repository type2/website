Subject: Re: [T2] Timing marks?

Jason,

I just sold my '76 which had a '79 california engine with the dual vacuum canister like yours.

&gt;Does that mark look like it's in the right place?

Seriously, don't mess around here. Calfornia fails you on smog if you're more than 3 degrees off, and your bus runs crappier besides. Get the scale on your bus, have busdepot overnight you one if need be. Busboys in Redding probably has them.

&gt;Ok, my confusion: I do have a 1976, and the engine &gt;code stamped on the housing does start with GD.  &gt;However, I have a dual-vacuum distributor, 
&gt;and thus have &quot;hose(s)&quot;, as opposed to &quot;hose&quot;.

Verify your distributor part#, because that tells you what to time it to. Engine codes mean nothing 20-30 years down the road.

Get the volkswagon or bosch part# and then cross reference it to the chart located here:

That will tell you exactly what and how to time it to.

Also, your engine should be timed dynamically with a timing light. Static will get you in the ball park, but you're not really on it till you strobe it. 

Billy
