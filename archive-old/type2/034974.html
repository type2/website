Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

One other idea on heating...

It may be possible to put some of those modern electrically heated (front)
seats into a bus from a modern vehicle.  (I wouldn't do it myself - I'd
rather keep the stock ones.)   But it is at least a possibility.  
I imagine they take a fair bit of juice from the battery, and you'd almost
certainly want an alternator (not generator) fitted.  It may even be
possible to take the heating elements (etc...) from a modern car and
actually fit this into a standard bus seat.  (Obviously there are safety
implications - all that VW horse-hair style padding may not mix with
electricity too well !?)  But some brave soul might like to try it.
