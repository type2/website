Subject: Someone said -

Someone just told me that the heads from a 1.8 fuel injected engine, the 
heads without  air injection holes, have an advantage in that they could be 
used on the early 2 liters.

OK, I imagine this to be without opening up the heads; so if my assumption 
is correct, is that right?!?!


Could you pull the 1.8 heads off a '75 FI engine and bolt them to a 2.0 '76 
FI engine??

Are the size of the valves on the 1.8 FI heads, and the 1.8 carbureted-fed 
heads  the same size??



Thank you.
