welcome

&gt; Looking underneath, I noticed a slight leak at the fuel filter 
&gt; and have decided to replace both it and all the fuel lines. 

good.

&gt; My questions are:
&gt; 1. What is the best way of draining the fuel tank?

running the engine.  I would plug the current leak as best possible and
let the engine run. 
second choice, siphion
third choice, gas can into another car.

&gt; 2. How much does a fuel tank hold?

a lot, the bay holds 14.8gal I suspect the brick holds pretty close to the
same

&gt; 3. Once the fuel lines are replaced how do you remove the air 
&gt; from the lines. 

turn on the engine, it will clear itself
