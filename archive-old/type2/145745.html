&gt; My daughter slashed a Wrangler LT on some construction metal- can anyone

IF you have the tire model and size, the tire dealer should be able to
match and order a replacement, if it is still in production.

The 185R14 Reinforced tires were used by various utility vehicles in
Europe.  Only the VWs made it to the US.

Some Toyota pickups used 185R14 load range D tires, which are compatible
with our buses.

Others have provided lists of brands.  Good Hunting!
