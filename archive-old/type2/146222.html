Subject: Re: [T2] need new engine

I'll add my 3.95 Slovenian Tolars...

My family has two Subies (wife has an Outback Wagon, I drive an Outback 
Sport) and we just put a fresh 1600 in our 69 Westy. Quite happy with 
that, since the bus runs GREAT and in Charleston, SC there are no real 
hills to climb. A few bridges, but that's what 3rd gear is for!

Time and energy and all that aside, I still subscribe to OEM = better. 
Not to say that I don't think the idea of a Subie-powered 79 Bus 
doesn't have merit...I just wouldn't do it.

I am quite happy with our current set-up.

&gt; Buy an Outback and go home happy. In the end this will be a much

&gt; Seriously this is a huge waist of money and time for something that is 
&gt; and always will remain a 1979 bus.
