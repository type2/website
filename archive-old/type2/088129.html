Subject: Re: [T2] mixture distributor pipe for dual carbs

I believe that is the air injection pipe for the diverter valve. Do you or did
you have a smog pump on your engine? Did you have air injection ports on the
cylinder heads, either 2 on each side or 2 on one and 1 on the other?
Some of it is shown in Bentley, section 5, page 21. But not the tubes and
plumbing. The pump is belt driven. The air produced is sent to the heads thru
a diverter valve. The air gets pumped into the exhaust ports to complete the
burn. The exhaust is a little rich and has fuel and fire, but is missing
oxygen. The pump adds oxygen to complete the burn. However you cannot pump air
in during deceleration when the system is over-rich due to the throttle plates
being closed and a very high vacuum drawing in idle fuel. If you add air now,
you will have serious backfires in the exhaust. Have you ever heard american
cars from the late 60's/early 70's do this every time they slow down for a red
light? Slow down and POW in the exhaust. This is why the diverter or dump
valve is installed. Ford used a dump valve so they did not have to put the
additional piping in. On deceleration, the air output would dump into the
atmosphere. All others that used the diverter valve would divert the output
air into the intake manifold below the throttle plates to add fresh air to the
mixture to stop the over-rich condition. The diverter valve is controlled by
manifold vacuum. When you have high rpms and a closed throttle, manifold
vacuum goes up and this opens the valve. Standard idle vacuum of 15-20 inches
will not open it.
#9 IS and always will be the balance tube.
If you do NOT have the pump and diverter valve, you do not need this pipe.
Here is a better pic of the pipe and the valve:

#7 is the pipe and #28 is the valve

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey folks, I'm sorry to bother y'all with this, but I'm in need of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; mixture distributor pipe for a dual carb engine.  This is a metal pipe
&gt; &gt;&gt; about 1/2 inch in diameter that connects to the upper inside front (f i
f)
&gt; &gt;&gt; part of the left hand carb, the left intake manifold, goes across the
&gt; &gt;&gt; engine under the air cleaner, and then connects to the right intake
&gt; &gt;&gt; manifold.  I'm also going to place an ad on thesamba_dot_com because I don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; think I'll have much luck finding this contraption.  does anyone who's
&gt; &gt;&gt; converted to dual webers or the like have one of these mixture pipes
lying
&gt; &gt;&gt; around that they would like to sell to me?   many thanks, Greg
