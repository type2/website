All tire questions should run the gauntlet of the Type2 Library, Tire
Section, please:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/library/tires.htm

If that doesn't work, try creative searches in the Archive. If that doesn't
work, try hanging from your teeth by your hair. If that doesn't work,
please do ask tire questions on the list--everybody else certainly has at
some time in the past. =^ )
