Subject: muffler installation

Here's one to add to the muffler installation thread.  When I put my 
german muffler on I was advised ty a  mechanic to punch in the baffles 
on the inside of the muffler.  These are intended to put back pressure 
at the exhaust ports on the heads.  Anyway I did this.  Was this a bad 
idea?  Now my engine acts like it has an exhaust leak mainly when I 
down shift.  Thanks for all your help.
