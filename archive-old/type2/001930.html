Chris you can forward this to all who need to know, I'm sorry to say we will
have to cancel the tour this year, due to some major construction work that
i hope will be under way at that time. I'll post more details on the monthly
news page on the web pages. Basicaly we are tearing down my old shop that i
used for storage of my project thing , and Jim Chows 57 23 window, and also
about 15 years of acumalated junk and crap. thats what i'll be doing on
saturday's for the month . The end result is a new 24x24 shop in the old
one's place, the plan is to move all the fabbing tools and stuff to the
smaller shop and clear out the big one for restoring buses. I hope every one
will understand my situation. Hopefully we will add another helper to speed
things up as well .This place is normally a disaster area anyway, but with
the stuff out of the old shop its gonna be one ungodly mess. thanks for
hopefully understanding. I will be attending the campout though. thanks ,,
