&gt; Just having a debate here about the effects of driving a Kombi with a stock

&gt; Has anyone ever taken readings to compare head and oils temps with it open and
&gt; closed?

yes I have, and when stopped or at VERY slow speeds it stays cooler with
the lid propped open, but driving at even normal speeds it is cooler with
the lid closed, and the faster your driving the bigger the difference.

at speed there is a piece of &quot;Dead&quot; air behind the bus so I guess it sucks
the air up from underneath, where the already used cooling air is
exhausted
