Subject: The Heads are cracked

 After all the shit, yes shit I have gone thru on the parts I was 
going to install in said heads. (see &quot;bitch of the week&quot;), soaked and
scrubbed and all studs removed and stuck them in the sink and scrubbed 
again with a tooth-brush, they were finally clean enough to put some
heat on them and look for cracks.

 Both heads, front cylinders, between the seats have cracks.

 &quot;When the wolf shows his teeth it does not mean he's smiling&quot;

 Yes they were &quot;used heads&quot; etc. This is my own doing.

 I'm starting to feel a little pressure here.

 My karma is running bad. I need a new chant or something.

 It could be worse, they could have been put on with out the &quot;hot
check&quot; and lasted to the bottom of my hill.

 I have considered throwing it in and just picking up a pair of 
&quot;rebuilt&quot;.

 I'm afraid to. 

 You can get a set for abouut $58 each.

 I took a look at the economics. It's a &quot;government&quot; word but we poor
people can pretend. 

 Core is worth $25 so the rebuilder has that much in up front.

 Labor rates at best in a garage in the poor part of town will be
about $25 an hour. Even if the guy doing the work is only paid $5/hr
there is still the &quot;overhead&quot;.

 So the guy is doing hundreds at a time, his &quot;cost per&quot; is low and he
can afford some tooling. That's a joke really. He isn't doing hundreds.

 Let's say he gets all his parts at half what I pay.

 Set of valves say $12. Set of guides say another $10.
 
 Valve Seats? I have no idea, let's say they are re-used.

 Re-use all the springs and stuff.

 So we have $25 core + $12 + $10, that's $47.

 We still have $11 left to play with for things like labor.

 That leaves about 1/2 hour for &quot;Jesus&quot; to dis-assemble, clean, inspect,
remove old seats and guides, inspect, weld the cracks,
grind out the imperfect weld, install new seats and valve guides,
grind all the valve seats, re-assemble, paint it silver and ship it.

 &quot;Jesus&quot; (pronounced Hay-soos for you &quot;foreigners&quot;) works hard for his
 money but I really feel he's taking a few short-cuts.

 Well now that I have that off my chest I can say in all honesty,
&quot;Venting&quot; is not nearly as satisfying as &quot;Felonious Assault&quot;.
