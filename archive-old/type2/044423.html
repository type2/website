&gt;I did it
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If the hatch springs right up when it is unlatched, then the air
pressure
&gt;&gt; in the engine compartment is positive.  If it does not, and tugging at
it
&gt;&gt; will not raise it, then the air pressure is negative.
&gt;
&gt;the differntial is quite small, as neither did it pop up nor was it hard
&gt;to open.  I suspect but have no evidence that it is slightly negative
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Second, the engine is noisier than you think!  Do not be shocked at how
&gt;&gt; loud it sounds with the cover off :-)
&gt;
&gt;and how!  took putting the cover back on to convince me the engine was not
&gt;blowing up!

I have done this at 65MPH also with the EXACT same results on my 78. My
wife was driving and even though I told her I was going to do it she almost
panicked from the noise, thought I had fallen in and was being sucked
through the fan.
