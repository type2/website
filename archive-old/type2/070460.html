Subject: Re: engine seal and CV boots

You don't have to pull the motor to replace the engine seal! It,s a tight 
fit but it can be threaded in.I start on the right side after removing 
the the intake elbows an slowly inch it through.The axles are removed 
with six flange bolts(24 in all).The Bently has a good discription on 
replacingg boots.-Mike

&gt; Hi all
&gt;       I was planning on pulling my engine today to change
&gt; the engine seal. I just read a post about a guy who did it
&gt; with out removing the engine. Is this possible or am I
&gt; dreaming. I really do not have a burning desire to pull
&gt; the motor so if I can do it with out......Hurrahhh!!!!!
&gt;       Also, I have not yet purchased a manual and I was
&gt; wondering if I will need to pull the tranny to change the CV
&gt; boots? Once agian, I sure hope not.
&gt;       I am still looking for anyone who has experience with
&gt; any particular insulation under their carpet in their bus. JC W
&gt; offers several differnet kinds and I am not sure which one 
&gt; I should get.
&gt; 
&gt; A quick update on what i have done so far. I pulled the interior
&gt; and found the rust is worse than I thought, but still not all
&gt; that bad. I plan on using a wire brush and my drill to scrape it
&gt; off and prep it for painting. So that is where I am at.
&gt; I hope to locate a compression tester today( borrow or rent) and
&gt; check the engine out. If the compression sucks I will be pulling her
&gt; anyway, but still not what I want to do. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well thanks .........Chip
