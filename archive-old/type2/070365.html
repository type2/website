Do people actually know the origin of that bear?

I asked that same question once when I was at a Dead show in 
Ventura, seeing those dancing bears everywhere and feeling, uh, pretty good.

I learned that there was a (pretty obscure, small release) 
Grateful Dead album called &quot;Bear's Choice.&quot; Those dancing teddy
bears were part of the album cover art.

Since then I've seen thousands of bears on bumpers, but to this day have not
seen a copy of Bear's Choice. I hear it's out there, though. 

There is a very nice Grateful Dead concordance website (don't have the URL 
handy now- just search on Grateful Dead) that could probably tell you all 
about it.
