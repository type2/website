Subject: Re: [T2] 68 rear drum - what will interchange

&gt; When I looked in my old 68+ parts book, there is a handwritten note that says 'use 211 609 439D / 440D only'
&gt; to chassis no. 210 2300 000. The original number is the same as above. I have not found any clue as to what
&gt; the handwritten in part numbers refer to....

I cant find 439 or 440d anywhere. mystery part number?
