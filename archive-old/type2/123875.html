Subject: RE: [T2] Engine tin painting/prep question

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. What did I do wrong? &lt;&lt;&lt; 

The key to preventing flash rusting is to keep it saturated. Like
SOAKED. And when you dry, dry it with a towel, then use a heat gun on
high heat to Flash Dry it. 


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Is there any possible way that this is really rust?&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yeah, it's really rust, but it's called Flash Rust, and it's not so bad.
In fact somewhere on the POR15_dot_com site they say that a little bit of it
actually helps the POR products to adhere better.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. If I sand the pieces again to remove the spots, will I have to
reapply the metal prep? &lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes, if you sand the pieces again, they'll need re-prepped. 


Cheers
Chris
