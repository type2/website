Subject: re: re: advice please

I've taken baby steps -
10w30 oil is out, 20-50 is in, oil filter is changed, new spark plugs, 
cleaned the oil sreen, took the tins off and had a look-see, and wiped down 
the oily parts with baby wipes (they're great - I used to clean my butcher 
tray with them when I was using oil paints.)

I'll share pics when I can find the cord to the camera, but here's a summary 
of what I found:
The oil filter was really wet and too easy to unscrew!! It was on, but I 
think there was a gap there. Everything around it was oily-ish. The tin next 
to it was covered in sludge. Passenger's side tin was fine.
There's a little oil seepage from the 4 central tubes at the engine top, and 
it looks from the bottom like the push-rod tube seals are leaking. I had a 
little bit of spray (a pththt) of the old oil out of the tailpipe when 
starting it up after the new oil refill. None since,  ...so far.
#4 spark plug had a little white residue, #3 and #1 were a little oily - not 
much. #2 I can't remember 'cuz I dropped the blasted thing so many times 
inside the tin - then had to get the new one in. Ugh!

It's all back together, with the new oil - so we took it out for a drive 
earlier tonight. the power is not what it used to be. That was true before I 
touched it today. When beginning the drive, and upon a hard acceleration, we 
have been making a cloud. Got home 1/2 hour ago - and the dipstick was still 
hot, but all the oil is still there, ...so far. No difference in 
'performance' from before - so the loose oil filter didn't matter.

It has been in need of a timing adjustment, but it seems more so now - 
idling low. If it's running too rich along with need of tune-up - that would 
explain a bit.

I don't have a compression check tool yet -  low compression results won't 
be a surprise. I'll need to get a good atv jack or engine jack, and a few 
more tools, then parts, then I can do more. I'm in a bind since this is the 
one family car for the moment.

Any red flags?

Stef
