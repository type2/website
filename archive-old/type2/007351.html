Subject: Re: Q: Adjusting Hydraulic Lifter Valves
Mime-Version: 1.0

The usual purpose for adjusting hydraulic lifters is to get the piston into
its center of free play range to allow for wear and warming up of the
engine valve train.   Since wear tends to be more in the direction of the
valves tightening as they seat deeper or stretch, the fewer turns of
adjustment allow for a longer time to next adjustment. (around 20k).
Lifters that don't pump up are bottoming out while opening the valve LESS,
and I don't think this causes a big problem if they pump up withing 15
minutes.  A lifter adjusted too loose will likely not open the valve
enough, especially while pumping up/warming up, and encourage slapping of
the piston against the snap-ring?
