Subject: VDO Oil Temp Sender plate!

Somebody told me that the cyl.head temp sender I was looking for was
available as a seperate item from BusBoys, and while I was looking, I
saw that they also had available for $19.95 that little sump plate,
pre-drilled for the oil temp sender. Sure wish I'd known that before I
ruined two plates (first one I had the wrong sender and it was too big,
second one I put the hole in the exact right place, but had the plate
upside down, so -- anyway, the 3rd time was good).
