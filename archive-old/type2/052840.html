Subject: Re: [VB] New Acronym

&gt; My take is
&gt; There is Acid Rain Falling on My Bus

No you've got it all wrong.... It's:

Then I Accidentaly Rudely Farted On My Bus

or

There I Am, Rambunctiously Falling Outta My Bus

or how about

There Is A Really Fuzzy Oyster On My Butt

It think this one is a winner:

Think I Am Ready For One More Bus

Yes I am
