&gt;The engine and transaxle from an Intrepid.

ACK! TBTHTPTHTD!

I thought the point of replacing the bus engine was not only to increase
power, but also increase reliability!  Not exactly what I think of when the
word &quot;Chrysler&quot; is mentioned.

I don't care if Chrysler is now German owned, they still have a way to go
quality-wise.

My vote for most reliable and most livable replacement engine is still the
Pinto(Ford) 4banger,
and a more powerful alternative would be the Merkur XR4ti turbo.  Note that
Ford has been producing this motor since time immemorial, and it is a proven
little engine.  Also, you're not sailing in uncharted waters, as sandrail
guys have used this engine for years.  Do a little websurfing.  There's
plenty of suppliers for this line, as well.

I have met two folks with this setup (chevette radiator mounted in place of
the rear hatch with a big cooling fan on the inside, with Pinto 4) and both
loved it.  Smooth running, uses a Weber 2-bbl, does not overheat with proper
care.

Have fun-
