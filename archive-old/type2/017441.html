Thanks a bunch volks for all the helpful info you've given me re: my
foray into the world of F.I. . I took the advice to test the head temp
sensor over #3 and found it to be in good shape, and then I did reseat
it , but I think it was working all along. I did find that , as I
suspected, the PO had messed with the throttle linkage, idle screw and
idle mixture screw in the air flow meter, probably in that order. The
throttle linkage was repaired/altered in a rinky dink sort of way and
I've fixed that. Much smoother operation now, but not perfect. I do have
access to a CA smog machine that a relative has at his garage and we did
a bit of troubleshooting. It does pass CA smog regs for that year but
just barely, by the very slightest margin, and I am definitely running
rich. So, now there is the question of the cold start valve. Is it
leaking? does it ever shut off?? Beats me but I will be tackling that
tomorrow. We have set everything else back to spec and to be truthful I
am running a LOT better. I think I should be able to go uphill faster
than 35 with no load though, and I'm all but certain that I ought to be
able to go faster than 65 on the highwway, again with no load. Or maybe
I'm deluding myself. This is the first time I've had a loaded up Westy.
Am I expecting too much ? In any case I think this engine has maybe 10
grand left on it. It was definitely abused but it is functional. There
was just about no metal when I didi the last oil change but I do notice
that when i adjusted my valves, and then checked them again, the intake
on #3 and 4 were tight again...not good I think....maybe the roda are
stretching. I'm guessing there is a rebuilt in my future...probably from
avp. In any case, thanks again for all the help and I'll let you know
how this thing progresses!

Cheers!
