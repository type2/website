It's nearly two years since I've had the Bus and after all the usual
mechanical repairs, fault fixing and service, I think I can now paint her. 
Not having much cash, I'm going to hand paint with a purpose made synthetic
enamel paint.  Trade named Repaint, made by Jenolite.  First I have body
preparation to do.  To make the work easier I would like to use hand power
tools.  Can anyone advise me if Palm/Rotary sanders are suitable to use on
the Bus bodywork?  Or is a drill with sanding attachment better?  I've read
some info on websites, but there have been no mention of power sanders.
