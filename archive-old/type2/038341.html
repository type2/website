Subject: Carbs, FI and a change of mind

Well I have had a number of posts regarding my desired change over to carbs
from FI.  The majority of you overwhelmingly said
	&quot;DON'T DO IT.&quot;
Well I may have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night, (actually
I wasn't born at night, but that is whole different issue and hardly the
point of this post),  and given the effects of age, every once in a while I
can actually manage to take good advice when it is slapping me in the face.
This would be one of those situations.  So for me, I will &quot;just say NO to
carbs!&quot;

Thank you to the many folks who replied with info.  Some special thanks to
David S. who explained some of why I should stay with the FI., Karl who
tells me I will find some good info on the system in the Bentley manual.  I
have ordered it and the idiot guide, and expect them to be here today or
tomorrow.

expect more questions... thanks
