After looking in the usual locations for words of wisdom, I've come to the
list for leads/advice:

I desperately need to repad the seats in my '75 Riviera.  Driver's side is
okay, but passenger seat will not meet approval of GF for long roadtrip to
Lake Tahoe over July 4th weekend.  The horsehair is nearly completely gone
&gt;from it, as is the under padding.  I've seen a couple old magazine articles
that allude to the subject, but can't find a really good, detailed breakdown
of the process.  I suppose I could do a quickie job with some foam and
carpet padding, which would work short-term, but am wondering if there are
better, more lasting methods of doing this.

Please advise.
