Subject: Re: Exhaust Emissions Help ?

        Chris,
        4X HC spec at idle? 1000ppm?? Good Grief! My '70 does 195. 
        Borderline at 2500rpm isn't good either.

        Didn't the smog-check guy offer to adjust the mixture? 

        No question, your vehicle emissions can be improved. Your Vanagon
is NOT headed for the crusher. Your milage may even improve after
you fix this.

        You've correctly diagnosed the problem- you're smelling
unburned gas in the exhaust. Your mixture is WAY too rich. I'm not
a T4 expert but I've gotta believe there's a mixture control in
there somewhere. Or a failure (Like a bad hose or wire) in the
injection system which is causing the system to run you rich. (I'm
assuming an '82, even non-California, is fuel-injection. Yes? 
And no Catalyst?)

        One obvious candidate, if you have one in that model,
is the O2 or Lambda sensor. Anyone know if he should have one? 
In a typical Bosch injection system, failure or disconnection of
the O2 sensor sends the mixture full-rich.

        I'm sorry to say it but this is the situation the smog laws 
are designed to fix: the vehicle runs fine, you want to keep it in good 
shape, but its a stinker. Without the semi-annual check, you wouldn't
have known.
