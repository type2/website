         That's one of the things I don't understand about the archives --
why is there any delay at all in archiving???  My only experience with
running a list is with majordomo, but with that, it's automatic. Why isn't
it here?
        There is the other part of the archives, where you can look at the
more recent stuff, but that doesn't always go back far enough, or so it
seems. And I know there's been times when I've searched for messages that I
*KNOW* had to be there -- like something David said on a specific subject,
and couldn't find it.

&gt; &gt;           I have to wonder what's wrong with the archives -- we just
&gt; &gt;discussed this at length not too long ago, and then even earlier about a
&gt; &gt;year ago or so.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, Harmon, the archives are confusing. The 'Complex Search'
&gt; says it is 'a few months behind' but the 'Standard search' and
&gt; 'advanced search' say that they are '6 months behind'
&gt;
&gt; Which, if either, is right?

            No clue.
