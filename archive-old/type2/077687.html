Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Interior Panel Patterns

Chris and everybody...
   If you have a custom cabinet shop nearby, ask if they use imported birch
plywood. A local shop here does and they order the stuff by the truckload. The
Euro-spec plywood (roughly 5'x5') comes in bundles. The plywood itself is close
to US spec stuff, but does require slightly different tooling for dados and such.

   Anyhow, getting to the point, these bundles have a sacrificial cover sheet (2
per bundle) of 1/8&quot; (not actually, but darn close) birch plywood. It is usually
tossed in the dumpster. One side of the plywood is usually munged up with
forklift scars and/or bootprints, but the side that was facing the inside of the
bundle is usually clean.

   I've stashed away a couple sheets for when I get around to the interior of my
project bus. Check your local shops and you might get lucky.

&gt; &gt;The issue regarding available plywood material sizes has been with us for a
&gt; &gt;while, but it's good to know there is a source for oversized sheets.  Anyone
&gt; &gt;have contact info on Harbor Sales?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; They have it:  http://www.aircraftspruce_dot_com/main.html
&gt;
&gt; And a great free catalog. (They'll make their money off of me when i buy
&gt; another set of engine instruments).
