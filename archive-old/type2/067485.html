Hi All,

I have a 1982 passenger Vanagon that my wife sayz, &quot;MUST GO!&quot;.  It's been
on 'her' side of the garage for quite a while now.

It has 90,000 miles, a hitch, decent tires, runs good. Two tone blue. Very
minor seam rust.

The lr has been hit, but not bad.  Needs a lr taillight. Driver's seat has
some wear, but interior is in good shape.  Exhaust needs work, but is very
drivable.

$950 where is (Kansas City area) and as is.  email me for more details.
