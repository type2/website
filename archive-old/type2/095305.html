Subject: Re: [T2] Starter problem 

There is a site that has a pretty good write-up + pictures on reconditioning 
the solenoid, the REAL culprit in the hot start.

I just picked up a replacement starter/solenoid and I want to recondition 
the solenoid before I install it.\

Does anyone have the web site??  I was just there a few weeks ago.

Thanks

Barry sends
