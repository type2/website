&gt; well if you take your time it does much heavier work, I've done decent
&gt; frame welding slow&gt;&gt;

&gt; If ya have a lot of time on your hands, it'll get the job done.
&gt;
&gt; I get it.
&gt;



&gt; So will a torch using coat hanger's.

I built a dune buggy that way, never broke in half so i guess it worked.

&gt; I didn't want to be working within the limitations of the cord outa the
&gt; outlet, and the stinger cord.

I use a generator...no power at all in my garage.

&gt; The Miller can run 035 or 045 wire day in and day out, at 200 amps
&gt; without taking a nap every 20 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion would be is that if anyone is looking to buy a half assed
&gt; decent mig welder, take a good hard look at more than you need.
&gt;
&gt; You'll never want more later down the road once you become proficient in
&gt; welding.
&gt;
&gt; I just got tired of waiting for it to cool down between it's duty
&gt; cycles.
&gt;
&gt; I paid $2300.00 for it--I'll sell it for $900.00.


and that is the reason most of us, especially those who are not into this
as an occupation cannot justify that much money.   I went to buy more gas
this week (and I only use the 80 bottle) and it had been 2 years since I
last bought gas..  so a little prudence is in order too.

my suggestion has always been &quot;buy the best you can afford for the job
your going to do&quot;  wasn't going into production, will only weld on MY bus
and some hobby type stuff for the house/garage.  not production type work.

big or important jobs I hire someone to do....I'm a better grinder than
weldor....

 Now my eyes are more important and spent almost as  much for mask as I
did for welder..
