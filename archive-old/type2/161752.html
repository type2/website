Subject: RE: [T2] Popping out of 4th gear at times?

We used to have a VW FLAPS here in Nashville that could get rebuilt 002s for
~475-500 (excluding core deposit which was like 200).

I found a builder that built mine for a flat labor rate and I ordered all the
parts and had them shipped to him. This way I knew that it got everything it
needed and wasn't just &quot;patched&quot;. I think total for parts and labor was around
500 and he did a fantastic job.

Bus depot has some on their site for $579.95 plus core. Pricey to ship
transmissions though - but you could get a replacement pretty quickly compared
to having someone build it.

&gt; So what is one typically looking at to have a tranny&gt; rebuilt? I know mine
needs to be done, but I thought I&gt; was looking at about $1000-$1200.
