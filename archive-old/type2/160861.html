Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Library Links

Ahh, there's the article.

Thanks for the working link.

To get to the broken one:
Open up type2_dot_com
Click the Library Link
Scroll down and click the &quot;Brakes&quot; Link, Brakes page opens
Scroll down to &quot;Convert to Self-Adjusting Brakes by Karl von Salzen&quot;
Note 404 error.

The critical difference is that this link points to &quot;selfadjust.html&quot;
while it should point to &quot;selfadjust.htm&quot;. The extra &quot;l&quot; is the link
breaker.

Back to bus content (although it is Friday) - self-adjusting rear
brakes seems like a great upgrade. With the proper availability one
might even be able to make it happen with new components. If I'm
reading it right you'd need 2 backing plates, 2 wheel cylinders, 4
shoes, and all the springs etc, but not new drums because you could
use the bay drum with the vanagon backing plate?

&gt; Strange, I went to www.type2_dot_com and clicked on library, scrolled down to Karl von Salzen and clicked on the
&gt; 1st link, convert to self-adjusting brakes and it opened right up.
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/library/brakes/selfadjust.htm
&gt;
&gt; Only difference between your dead link and mine is the www........
