Subject: [T2] tuning help needed on rebuild

Well,  the elation of the rebuild is still in me but it's getting 
pushed aside by the frustration with the tuning of the carb and idling
and timimg.  I'm no expert by any means and I could really use some tips
and pointers.

Here's what I'm working with:  34pict3 carb (german rebuilt by myself)
Dual vac advance dizzy VW# 113 905 205 AJ,  New bosch blue coil, new
points and condensor, rebuilt generator

I've set initial timing at 5 deg ATDC (to the left of the mark) and it 
seems very erratic.  Idle seems to hover around 800 to 900 but isn't 
rock steady.  I've set the idle mixture screw at 2.5 turns out.

Now my understanding is that when I turn the air mixture screw the idle
should increase/decrease depending on how I turn it.  Well, it doesn't
change at all.  And the engine seems to run horridly at 5 deg ATDC.

It actually ran better at 5-7 deg BTDC!!!

Could I have a vacuum leak?

BTW dwell is set at 48 deg.

please give me some thoughts.  I spent a few hours in the archives last
night and received some good tips and looking for more thoughts.

Thanks
