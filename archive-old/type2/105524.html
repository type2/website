&gt; Except for the clutch.  One the way down, I was able to shift from 1st
&gt; through 3rd okay (35 mph speed limit).  A little stiff, but it worked.  But
&gt; after about 6-7 minutes, I had a devil of a time shifting in and out of
&gt; gear.  Like the clutch would work.  I could shift into gear with the bus
&gt; off, and I could shift from 1st to 2nd to 4th while driving if I was very,
&gt; very careful.

Somewhat related but did someone already mention to check the transmission
fluid level?
