&gt;Bob, did you remove the clips ? There are clips  (3?) that hold the pressure
&gt;plate in that position during shipment. They must be removed before
&gt;installation. They look like big staples... Have a look.

Yes, I removed the &quot;staples&quot;.
I think the &quot;new&quot; clutch I got is not right, and I may have to put the old 
one back in. :-(

It seems to my mind that the release ring and the release levers would 
normally be loaded / nest AWAY from the clutch plate, and the release 
bearing then pushes them inward during gear changing.

Damn !
