Subject: what dual carbs for a T4 2. liter

I'm looking to replace my Weber progressive with a set of dual carbs for my
'78 bus.

 

What to get???

Dells, Webbers, Kadrons, solexes?????

What size???

What type is better on gas mileage???

What will help my motor run cooler???

I want to keep my vacuum dizzy, will this matter???

Who is a recommended retailer????

I also want to be able to pull a &quot;Gregg Potts&quot; style trailer.

 

 

TIA

MikeL
