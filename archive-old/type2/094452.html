Maybe you could elaborate on your goal/problem...

&gt; I pulled the two wires off the #1 terminal on the coil to diable the
&gt; spark and re-cranked but no fuel came out of the injectors -  but I am
&gt; not sure if I disabled the electrical signal to the injectors by pulling
&gt; these wires.

IIRC (at least it applies to my model year) the FI wiring harness is
connected to the coil and pulses the fuel injectors in time with the coil.
If you disable the coil the injectors won't fire.
