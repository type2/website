Subject: '72 Weekender for sale

I am selling my '72 hardtop camper (1.7 L engine). It does not have the
poptop. It came from VW (originally sold in Chattanooga, I have the
owners manual and papers) as a Weekender model (full width fold out bed,
and canvis cot for child. The cot installs over the front seats. I also
have the fitted snap-in curtain for the front window. The bus needs some
work, but when last driven, ran great. The engine and transmission are
not installed, but I have them. I also have another engine (2.0 L) that
goes with the bus.
The body needs paint, but overall, is in nice shape. The interior is
clean and ready to use for camping.
I have an almost complete set of never before installed door and window
rubber seals. Also included are new (not installed) front disks and flex
brake lines.
I have an aftermarket set of dual dellorto carburettors that I ran on
this bus.
The transmission was removed in order to install new shiftrod bushings
(but I never finished the install) There are also several new type 2 oil
filters, and many assorted parts that I just can't remember, and
probably doen't even know I have at this time.
The bus is being sold due to a divorce, and must leave the house soon.
Daisy has been a GREAT bus since I drove her home 12 years ago, and I
hate to see her go. If you are interested, please understand that VW
busses are friends, and just a car, and must be treated nice.
I will listen to offers, but due to the amount of new parts included,
and the overall good condition of the bus, I will not move much on the
price.
Also, the key fits ALL the locks and the ignition switch. The sliding
door moves free and easy, with no binding or jumping out of track.
The bus is located about 1 mile North of the LaFayette, GA Wal-Mart. I
don't have photos yet, but I will be able to take some early next week.
