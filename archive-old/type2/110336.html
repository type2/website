Subject: adjusting hydraulic valves LR

If you have to swap out seals on the pushrod tubes...being that you have to 
remove the rocker arms...how long do you have to wait before readjusting valves 
so that lifters bleed down? and is it possible to cause problems readjusting 
hydraulic valves that have already been worn in 40K+
