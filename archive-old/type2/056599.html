Subject: Re: 3rd gear synchro bad

Hi,

&gt;  bad news is that the 3rd gear
&gt; syncro seems to
&gt; be non-functional.  Is is possible to have a single syncro into a tranny
&gt; at a reasonable cost?  

 How bad is it? I get a &quot;crunch&quot; if I upshift to third too quickly but if I pause for a heartbeat just before engaging the gear (ie slide the shifter up to the gate, pause, engage the gear) then it's OK (downshifting is fine).
 I expect that it'll work like this for years.

&gt; Perhaps I can get used to double clutching like in the pre-syncronized
&gt; days.  At least now I have a core for a rebuild with a somewhat
&gt; functional bus 'till then.

 Sounds like you're getting it on the downshift, too. DDCing should work fine, in fact you probably don't even need to do that, just rev-matching the downshift will probably work.

Cheers,
        W.
