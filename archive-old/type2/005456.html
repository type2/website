Hi all, I tried to advise this discussion be taken off list. I hold Erin in
great regard and I admit I don't know Kevin but have corresponded with him
by p-mail and have found him to be courteous. It's nice to see all of the
posts on the subject to mainly be nice and I enjoy the list for many
reasons. I admire all who stick their neck out and post to these lists since
they open themselves up to criticism. There are some who are consistent
posters who I stop and read every word and others who I &quot;Delete&quot; when I see
their name. It's a shame that we might lose a resource but being multi
thumbed I can understand how much effort must go into compiling these lists.
  Hopefully this can be put to rest and we can go on sharing ideas and
asking questions.

Has anyone removed the sink/icebox from a Westy and made a set of drawers
 no Lou not pants) to go in their place? I have an incomplete sink/icebox
and want to use the space wisely.
