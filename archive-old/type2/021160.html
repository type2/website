&gt; a friend of mine called me today and said his 71 bus would only move in
&gt; reverse...
&gt;
&gt; it would go in neutral , and the othe gears but not move forward....
&gt; if he put it in reverse and revved up the motor pretty high it would move in
&gt; reverse......
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas ?
&gt;
&gt; my thoughts are either :
&gt; internal tranny damage
&gt; dead CV that only catches in reverse
&gt; splines are dead in the rear drum hub allowingaxle to freewheel

Old:
The brakes might be locked up. There is more gear reduction in reverse than any
other gear. Possibly rusted emergency brake cable, or bad hydraulic hoses that
are internally plugged.
Could also be linkage. Is the trans actually going into 1st gear? Does it kill
when he lets out the clutch, or is it still in neutral?
