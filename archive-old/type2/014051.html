Subject: 1975 westy wiring

I'm looking for a wiring diagram for my 75 Westy.  The
fridge still needs to be hooked up...and it is a
stove/fridge unit from what I believe, is from a 78.

Anyway, it appears that I have some extra wires.  I
found a wiring diagram for a '78, but I'm not sure if
this is sufficient.

I had a no start today.  I drove to the second day of
my ultimate tourney...played, lost...eliminated, then
tried to go for some lunch.  No start.  A jump got me
going.  It's a new battery, but I need to find the
power drain.  I didn't get a warning light on the
dash, about the alternator.  I was running the lights,
wipers, a stereo and an amp.  Anyway, the search is on
for the power drain.

Also...my new oil pressure sender appears to be
working, and here's the other question.  When I'm at a
stoplight at idle (automatic,) my oil pressure idiot
light comes on.  Now, i have to run a lead wire for
the dash gauge...so I don't know what pressure I'm
usually running at.  Is this normal?  Or is it just a
matter of pouring some extra oil down in the extension
hose that I used?  Is the oil having issues getting to
the sender due to the extension?

Thanks again volks!
Missy:)
