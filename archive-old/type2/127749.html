Subject: Re: Firewall gasline grommets

Tim, I've been going grommet crazy for the past couple weeks with my 
bus. I took all the grommets out to get my tin powdercoated. I found 
grommets of every size at Lowe's. Go to the fasteners section, then find 
the drawers labled &quot;hard to find parts&quot; and find the drawer labled 
&quot;Rubber Grommets.&quot; It should be near the rubber stoppers, which also serve 
great purposes when dealing with westy cabinet doors, etc. I found the 
rubber firewall battery cable grommets at busdepot. You could alter one 
of those to fit the gas line if you wanted to go VW instead of Lowe's.

Does anyone have a source for fire wall tin rubber grommet for the gas 
line. I have a stock '79 bus.

Thanks
