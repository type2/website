Hy guys

I have been reading the archives trying to see if I can understand the =
mistery around settings points with a dwell meter, and by now (but still =
looking) I have three quiestion I must ask in order to gethe whole =
picture.

1. To take a reading from the dwwell meter the engine must be running, =
just cranked or it is the same ?

2. Can I using a Volt/Ohm meter set the points of my 6V with a reading =
of 3.35V ?

3. I found in the archives that somebody uses a Volt/Ohm meter to static =
time the bus, How could do that ?


Thanks

Roberto
