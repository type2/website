&gt; I had to take a blunt screwdriver / chisel and hammer to one of my star wheels.
&gt; Once I got it moving, after definately causing some minor damage, I resorted to
&gt; vice grips and LW and finally got it out.
&gt; I then cleaned it and filed the damage off.  It was reuseable so I was lucky.
&gt; This seems to be a part that is quite readily available in these parts at the
&gt; wreckers.  I'm sure you could find one or a whole set or someone near you could.

You can get the adjuster stars made of brass which really reduce seizing.
I have brass stars and liberal antiseize in there and it works well.
