&gt; I just purchased a 1978 VW Automatic Transporter. The thing is in pretty
&gt; good shape with only 129,000 miles. I have a small tranny leak that I'll be
&gt; having repaired here later this week.

I have a 78 auto type 2 also
&gt; 
&gt; My question is regarding general maintainance. What the best type of oil to
&gt; us in the 2000cc engine? What other things should be looked at on a regular
&gt; basis? Any information would be helpful. Thanks!

drop the tranny pan, put in a GOOD fluid and clean the filter, this is
frequently overlooked, also check the final drive which uses a 90 weight
gear oil.

I always use a synthetic oil in my 2L engine with excellent results (but
there is a lot of controversy over synthetics)

check all your brake lines and fuel lines, the fuel lines especially as
they are run at a pretty good presure (28psi) which can leak and start a
fire

also the cold start valve should be replaced with the newer ones, the old
ones would fail in the &quot;on&quot; position and could cause a fire, the newer
ones fail in the &quot;off&quot; position.  (not a common occurance, but once can
ruin your whole day!)
 &gt; 
&gt; Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to get a seal
&gt; for that? And how tough is it to install?

can't help you with the roof, mine is solid
