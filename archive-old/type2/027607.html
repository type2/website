I was on my way to Dodge City, KS yesterday about 8 hours from Columbia, MO. 
I stoped to get gas and when I came back out I then checked my oil and 
looked underneath the bus to make sure its not leaking any. Well there was a 
huge puddle at the front of the engine. Which of course was tranny oil, 
which means blown tranny seal. I know there was a thread on tranny oil a 
week ago or so, but I didn't catch most of it. All that was available to put 
in it was 80w-90 high presure GL-5 transmision oil. It smelled about the 
same and was as thick so I filled up with it. I think GL-5 messes something 
up eventually, but other then that should it get back home to Missouri as 
long as I keep it full?? It doesn't shift as smoothly as before but at least 
the tranny isn't dry.

Any suggestions welcome,
Nathan
