Though I have no personal experience to back this up, I think that 
camper-converted buses are a little like apartments. When you get into a 
long-term relationship, you get another apartment together. Same with a 
bus, although you can hold onto the adventurewagon for yourself. 

What better way to take a relationship to the next stage than to go 
shopping for a bus together?

Way better than hacking into the bulkhead.
