Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative


&gt;The subject of gas cut foo valves made me think of the
&gt;cut off valve used on my motorcycle's gas tank. Here
&gt;is an article about converting a generic petcock to
&gt;use on a sx650. Any way, I thought the picture could
&gt;be helpful. I know that these are made to screw
&gt;directly into a gas tank but you could just take a
&gt;large diameter piece of fuel line and slip it over the
&gt;threaded end with a hose clamp. then, you would just
&gt;need to buy one of those plastic fuel line step down
&gt;fittings and connect that to your fuel line from the
&gt;tank. If I am not mistaken, the filter on it comes out
&gt;if it makes it easier. This little gadget only costs
&gt;about $15.00 from what I understand.

The only problem is that it is too small to flow enough gasoline just like 
the first electric solenoid I posted.

The only cheap alternative I know of right now is a used gas tank selector 
valve from a full size Ford p/u. To stop fuel flow you set the switch to 
the gas tank that isn't there (and to the nipples that have been capped off).

Cheap and basic.
