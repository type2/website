Subject: [T2] Oil Leak


&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; During my engine rebuilt, because of a compression problem (less 30 %), i
&gt; noticed that i have an oil leak betwen the case and the cilinder and
betwen
&gt; the cilinder  and the cilinder head i wounder if this could be the problem
&gt; in compression. The valves seem ok even very durty. I would like to
replace
&gt; the piston rings but i would like to know if it's necesary any special
tool
&gt; to do this and if i'll have any problems putting the pistons back in the
&gt; cilinder.
&gt;
&gt; thank's in advance.
