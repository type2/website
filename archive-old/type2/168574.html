Subject: Flux Core Welding Problems

Jason,

I have some limited experience with both stick welding &amp; MIG (took
classes =
locally) &amp; with a Harbor Freight flux-core that was just too
inexpensive =
to pass up. My recent experience has been with a mower deck made of
steel =
1/16&quot; to 1/8&quot; thick. Sounds like you're either not running enough
amperage =
or you've got a bad ground connection. Don is correct about turning
down =
the wire speed &amp; going slower, too. compared to a 3/32&quot; welding rod,
say, =
a .035&quot; wire is tiny. It's easy enough to make a big molten blob, but
for =
good penetration, you have to remember that you're making miniature
welds. =
I had to adjust all my reflexes, &amp; I still get a lot of bad ones from
=
trying to go too fast. Nevertheless, my little &quot;buzz box&quot; has been
really =
handy around the shop, &amp; has more than paid for itself. I wouldn't try
to =
do sheet metal with it, though * a true MIG with gas is the ticket for
=
thin stuff.

Ground can be tricky. Check to see that your ground clamp is in good =
shape, not loose on the wire, corroded, or beat up. Make sure the metal
=
you're clamping it to has been ground clean. You may have to not only
grid =
clean both pieces you're trying to join, but clamp them together, as
well, =
to make sure they're both well grounded. Flux-core welding will leave
slag =
on the weld bead, just like stick welding, When you stop, you have to
wire =
brush the junk off the weld before starting again, to get good fusion.

If you have a good ground, &amp; enough amps, the right wire speed, &amp;
you're =
going slow enough, You'll hear a characteristic steady buzzing sound
that =
lets you know you're &quot;in the zone&quot;. If any of these  elements are off,
=
you'll hear sizzling &amp; popping that sounds like frying bacon. The
&quot;frying =
bacon&quot; sound will also happen if you're using solid wire &amp; forget to
turn =
the gas on. Molten slag will fly everywhere, too, annoying bystanders
=
immensly.=20

Ask me how I know!

Hope this helps,


Bzzzzzzzz..Pop!! Dang it!!!...

I posed this question to Stiles, but I guess he's busy - no problem.

I have a Craftsman Professional wire-feed welder that is running
flux-core
wire. No gas just wire.

I cut up an old steel bed frame to practice one, but am having one hell
of =
a
time getting penetration through the steel!
