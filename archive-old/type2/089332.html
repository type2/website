Congratulations, Bob, for being a combination mechanic and contortionist!
Did you take a video to share with us all (of you, upside down, feet against
the headrest)? But why? I just removed an instrument cluster from a '79, and
all it takes is removing four screws at the corner, pulling off three
colored airvent knobs, and disconnecting the speedo cable.. That comes off
by hand and is easy to locate. There are still some wires on there, but no
need to disconnect any of them (still plenty of room to pull it out and work
on it) and this would give you a chance to replace any burned out bulbs in
the instrument cluster also.  Jan B

 I just installed a tach in the clock cavity ............
 without removing the dash faceplate !!

 It was a bear of a job !!
Beer, patience, magic words, and the help of my cousin !

Oh! I see.. You provided the beer, patience, and magic words, while your
cousin &quot;helped&quot;.. So HIS feet were on the headrest! LOL..
Just kidding, you know! Jan B
