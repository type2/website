&gt;Hey Tim-
&gt;
&gt;THnaks so much for your suggestion- as stated I am not fairly ignorant of 
&gt;Bosch starter so was looking for info on a) if their starters are up to 
&gt;the task of starting as it seems to be a common complaint i have heard of 
&gt;them prematurely croaking

90% of starter, switch and wiring problems have to do with poor battery 
maintenance. If reliable amps are available from the battery, you get no 
excess heat stresses sucking the life out of everything else.

&gt;and b) if it was worth the extra expen$e to go with aftermarket. Generally 
&gt;I defer to factory as i know I won't have any hassles, but am not opposed 
&gt;to small improvements if they don't make life more complicated!

Improve the life of all the electrical components by keeping the battery 
clean at all times. Waste no money on overcoming this foundation weakness 
by using components designed to draw MORE amps than stock. The least 
complication is stock or approved alternate per the Bosch ReMan/NewMan 
listings.
