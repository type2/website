Subject: Re: [T2] NEEDED 78 stub axle, Baltimore

well found out what the expensive noise was today

took out my left rear bearings.

got new bearings coming but just found out the stub axle is damaged

can't get a hold of my usual sources (suspects)

in any case, anyone in the mid Atlantic area have a 78 stub axle in decent
shape handy?????

thanks
Bob
