Subject: '78 Camper For Sale in Seattle
Message-ID: &lt;19990629005940.54393.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Once again, and for good this time, my '78 Riviera pop-top camper is for 
sale. Sorry about the undecidedness last time but now I'm sure I want to 
sell it.

So here are the details.

2.0 litre Fuel Injection. Runs great.  93,000 miles!
hydraulic lifters
body is light brown on top, dar brown on bottom with stripes all the way 
around (I think it is the Champagne Edition)
Body is in good shape with a tiny bit of rust and a few minor dents and 
scraches.
Interior is in great shape. Has five seat belts. Rear seat/couch/bed is 
split in the middle so it can fold out half at a time. A nice feature 
Westies don't have.
pop-top is in great shape. it isn't a cot, it is a real bed.
Sink/closet is behind the driver. Sink works.
No stove/ice box but this creates alot of extra space which I like better. 
Still has the propane tank underneath though.

Overall it is a very reliable car and is a great camper. I have taken it to 
Oregon ang it was great.

I live in the White Center area of Seattle and would be happy for you to 
come look at it or I could come to you.
My address is 10746 27th S.W. 98146 Seattle
or you can reach me at (206) 431-9023

The reason I'm selling it is to pay for a 3 month training school to prepare 
me to go on missionary trips. The school costs $2500 so I'm asking $2500 
which is a very good price for this camper which has many good years left in 
it. I think it has only been used for camping by the previous 2 owners.

Thanks for all inquiries,
                           Simon King
