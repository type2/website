&lt;&lt; Everyone who he spammed should call numerous times and hang up when he

answers. You get charged Per CALL with an 800 number (anywhere from 10 cents

to 50 cents a call), run up his phone bill and he will regret ever spamming

Certain neighborhoods in NJ get targeted by various groups for marketing
purposes... Some areas get flooded by calls and fliers for home repairs,
some by 'attorney mills', soliciting 'pain and suffering' cases, etc. Some-
one got 'very' tired of the solicitation and spent a few bucks at Kinkos
to get a little revenge...He/she printed a few hundred fliers with the
800 number of an attorney's office. Quite quickly, the attorney's num-
ber crashed (and left him with a large phone bill, I'd gather), after he
got thousands of calls on his number. Oh yeah, the flier? A rather
fetching picture of a young lady, the 800 number, and the offer...
' Free Fone Sex '...8-)
