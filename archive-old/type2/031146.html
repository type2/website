Subject: Re: Removing rear composite drums
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.96.990318105756.6349A-100000_at_excalibur.onate.nmhs_dot_edu&gt;

The composite drums on my Vanagon were not coming off, even after repeated
assults with a hammer (not surprising since it hadn't moved in about three
years).  I was told to loosen the two retaining bolts, then backup and hit
the brakes hard.  Move forward and repeat.  Do the whole thing a couple of
times.  When I jacked it up and pulled the wheel, the drum virtually fell
off. 

Hope this helps!

CUL,
Dale
