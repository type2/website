All:

My friend is stumped with a problem with his motor, it applies to 71 and
older busses so i have posted to both lists (even though his is a 64.)

He is not on either list so if you have suggestions please reply to him
directly, or if you wish to post to the list you can reply to all as i
have cc'ed him on this message.

(his e-mail is kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net)

thanks for your help,

Steve

Heya Spacemonkeys!

I am in need of some sage-like advice in regards to my recent bus problems.

As some of you may be aware, I've been having some serious trouble with the
bus lately.  It all started when I noticed that exhaust valve on #3 cylinder
was getting tighter with each adjustment.  Not long ago, I had to resort to
shimming out the rocker to adjust the valve!  Not long after that, the Turk
was having some serious lack of power, running rough, and generally feeling
like it was running on 3 cylinders only.

I did a compression test...  Cyl 1: 120psi Cyl 2: 150psi Cyl 3: 60psi and
Cyl 4: 145psi.  That being that, I removed the engine, tore it down and
inspected the heads.  Being a dual-port, it of course had cracks from the
spark plug holes to the exhaust valves in all chambers (and people wonder
why I hate dual-ports!) and the exhaust valve in #3 was WAY sunk down.

I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

The rest of the motor seemed in great shape though. Very little carbon
buildup in chambers and on tops of heads, and I could still see cross-hatch
after 80,000 miles of service!  End play good, no rod knockings, good oil
pressure, etc.

So, I tote'em down to Archway, and get me a pair of brand spankin' new heads
(hey, crappy refurbished ones where only like 15$ cheaper, so why not eh?)
Jim ensures me the chamber volumes are 52cc's - they've done like jillions
of these new heads, so he should know he says.

So, I take'em home, and spend like the next 12 hours filling away all the
damned mold-flashing clogging up the fins and such, and the next day start
to installing them.  I do a check of my deck-height (forget what it was
offhand), and I *should* end up with a compression ratio of 7.1:1  Fine.
Get'em on, put the motor back together, adjust valves, etc.  Install engine,
get it started, adjust carb, timing, etc.

She runs SMOOTH AS SILK, revs up great, no hesitation.  Just sitting there
and revving, everything seems fine.  No funny smells. No funny noises.
Gauges read good temps.

I am Jack's overwhelming sense of joy.

I pull out of the garage, head down the road, and damned thing ONLY DOES
40MPH, wide open throttle.  F^&amp;K!!!!

I try the highway, get it up to 60.. sorta..  just barely... any hills and I
would have been toast.

I am Jack's agony of defeat.

Go home.  What's that big glowing orange orb in the sky?  OH, that's the
SUN!  It's 6AM..  I've been up all night.

Screw it.  I go ridding with the scooter club on Sunday instead of working
more on the bus.

Today, after class, I get home and head back out.  Did a valve adjustment
(some were loose) and checked the bottom head nuts for proper torque.  Most
OK, but a couple seemed tight.  Fixed that.  I removed the carb, and cleaned
it up per Ed's suggestion.  Did another compression test... 1: 130 2:130
3:130 4:130.. HOT DAMM!  Checked timing again.  30 degrees total advance..
Close enough.  Motor fires right up, idles perfectly.  Choke works fine.

Another test drive.  MAYBE a bit more powerful this time.  I get up to 60,
but that's pedal to the matt.  Still seems like there's not as much power as
I used to have.  Unfortunenately, there aren't that good of hill on 44
between Kingshighway and Lindberg, but I can tell ya, even the kiddie slopes
had be boggin out some.   At least my speedo was INDICATING 60mph.. seemed
like I was haulin' ass though. Hmmmm.

Head temps were low  275-300deg.  Oil was higher than normal though 220 deg,
but pressure was the same at 40something pounds at highway speed.

Took her home, back in the garage.. where the hell do I go from here??
Could I have 130 pounds compression, yet have a crappy enough CR to get no
power like this??  I have a tie-rod going bad.. could bad alignment be
producing enough drag to slow me down this much?  I just don't know.

Thanks in advance for any tips/advice!

I am Jacks sleepy head..
time to hit the sack!
