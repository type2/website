&gt; &gt; hey guys and gals, i have a stewart warner southwind gas heater for a
&gt; &gt; bus model #8332b-12V.
&gt; &gt; I have run the gas line with a filter in it and i have had it running
&gt; &gt; for only a few seconds ,
&gt; &gt;  but it backfires and then theres no fire..i have resoldered the
&gt; &gt; condenser for better contact,
&gt; &gt; but it has not helped...any ideas? also after it backfires i smell raw
&gt; &gt; gas...thanks joe
