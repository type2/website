Mike,

It is very astute of you to raise this subject.  You don't often need a
surface plate in automotive work but it is one tool for whose purpose and
role there is no substitute.  There are times when you must measure things
relative to a known standard of accuracy.  The dead-flat top of a surface
plate serves as the base-line not only for basic measurements, it allows you
to periodically gauge and adjust your precision measuring instruments.  The
precision and accuracy of your machine work, and much of your assembly work,
depends on having a standard of known accuracy and precision against which
you may gauge your tools and components for assembly. 
 
Although a small, commercial-grade (as compared to laboratory-grade) surface
plate is not especially expensive, for automotive work there are a couple of
acceptable alternatives.  The flattest stuff commonly available throughout
America is a gravestone,  a slab of polished stone, with granite preferred
over marble.  After that comes a hunk of  polished plate glass.

Minimum size needed for working with veedubs is about a foot by a foot and a
half.

Surface plates are usually made of granite.  Their surface is true to within
half a tenth (.0005&quot;) across the longest dimension of the plate, that is,
from corner to corner.  They must  be properly supported.  Even a three inch
plate will show some droop if you support only the corners.  The usual trick
is to place the plate on a pad of felt or a piece of carpet.

A cover of light plywood, with a piece of felt or cloth glued to the
contacting surface, is usually made to cover the plate when not in use.

After polished stone and glass, a heavy hunk of cast iron is probably your
best bet.  You can blue the top of the plate and work it flat with scrapers
and chisels.  This used to be one of the first chores for every apprentice
machinest.  Some machinest's  training programs in England and Germany
started with the kids making their (wooden) tool box.  At each level of the
program the bottom layer of students was peeled away, directed toward less
demanding trades, each of which had paths of advancement paralleling the
other trades.  Woodworking is very much related to machine work since the
patterns used in every foundry start as wooden models.

American programs of the same era typically started at the forge, the
spun-off skills including farriers, wain-wrights (ie, wagon-makers),
wheel-wrights, blacksmiths and so on up the ladder culminating with men who
made the machines to make the machines, if you get my drift.

An engine lathe is often described as the only machine capable of reproducing
itself (which happens to be true).  One of the best stories of the modern age
is how the FIRST thread-cutting lathe was created.  Oddly enough, the tale
involves computers, or at least their historic analog -- Babbage's
'Analytical Engine'.  

In the automotive world of today 'mechanic' is used to describe someone who
can plug in a diagnostic machine, and who knows how to replace entire
assemblies.  Traditional automotive mechanics has become the realm of the
'automotive machinest,' the fellow in the back of the shop who understands
tolerance and fit, a fellow who can build an engine from scratch if that is
what's needed.  Subscribers to this list are a lot closer to the back of the
shop than the front :-) 

There's more to being a good mechanic than owning a set of greasy
fingernails.
