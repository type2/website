&lt;&lt; VW busses have a dead spot in their windflow that can cause exhaust fumes 
from the muffler to raise up the rear of the bus into the engine compartment 
through deterioating/missing seals. &gt;&gt;

Make sure the exhaust exits off to the side of the bus like the the stock 
system did.  DO NOT let yourself get talked into installing a bug muffler or 
cheap &quot;monza&quot; exhaust that has the tailpipes exiting directly behind the bus!

The exhaust MUST exit well of to the side in the passing &quot;slip stream&quot;.  If 
not, the exhaust gases will behave just as Isaiah states and accumulate in 
the dead air space directly behind the bus to be eventually sucked into the 
heat exchangers or around the seals on your rear hatch and into the cab.
