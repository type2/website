Subject: starter relay blowing fuses

Hi
Haven't done any research or testing yet, but I thought I'd throw this out 
in case anyone has similar experience. Preface: I have a '78 bus that 
someone modified with a new ignition key that looks like it was just patched 
into the stock ignition wiring. Not sure why, and I haven't gone through 
wiring. The cold start valve is not getting any electricity. Haven't figured 
out if the thermo switch isn't grounding it, or maybe the double relay isn't 
sending power to the csv. That's all I think I know about csv's.
Anyway, I've installed a hard start relay which has greatly improved my 
starting. I've been driving around town without problem for a few weeks. 
Today - no ignition. Checked the battery, it's fine. Checked the starter 
connections: fine. The starter relay fuse, 15 amp, is blown. Put a new one 
in. Turn the key, click, nothing. Check the fuse - it's blown.
Bad ground somewhere? Nothing else has changed - I drove around all day 
yesterday.

Thanks
Mat
