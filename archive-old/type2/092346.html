Subject: Adding Oxygen Sensor.

Hi All:

I have an 82 Federal Vanagon, aircooled 1970 cc with FI. The 82's came
with Bosch's L-Jetronic FI, which for federal vehicles run open loop
without an oxygen sensor. Looking through the Bosch L-Jetronic manual it
indicates that running open loop will ruin the catalytic converter
sooner as the air/fuel mixture may not remain ideal. As I have just got
all the parts to replace my old exhaust system (including new cat) I
want to make them last as long as possible.

From what I can tell the ECU can accommodate an oxygen sensor on pins 24
and 23 (shield). Has anyone ever added a sensor to a federal vehicle?
Does only the ECU for CA support the oxygen sensor as I think the ECU's
for CA have different part numbers than the federal ones? One difference
is that the CA ECU's do not need the series resistors for the injectors.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Regards,
