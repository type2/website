Tony, have you considered moving south?  I  lived in Houston for 5 years and wondered why I ever left Chattanooga  when I returned.  2 hours from Atlanta, 2 hours from Knoxville,  2.5 hours from Nashville, and great scenery all in between.  Think  about it.  Cheers...KR

    Since I live in the most densely populated area in the US -
The NY-NJ permajam area - I can understand this...My guess
would be that most cars are primarily used for commuting
and most of the greater (and lesser) metropolitan areas are
also filled with cars, slowly crawling to and from work...A
&quot;driver's car&quot; would be quite out of place in all of these areas
and probably not much fun to drive. A better stereo would
be a performance upgrade with better results in driving pleasure
than a set of Pirelli P6's...I mean how much fun would it be to
drive a Bugatti Veyron (top speed over 250 mph) for the forty-
five minutes it takes to go down the Helix to the Lincoln Tunnel
at about five mph... ?-(
