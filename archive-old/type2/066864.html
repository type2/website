&gt;&gt;I think pure sodium can explode when exposed to the atmosphere.  My
&gt;&gt;chemistry teacher in college kept the sodium immersed in oil.
&gt;
&gt;That would be phosphorus, not sodium.

Actually, sodium *is* also extremely reactive (i.e., flammable).
It's fun to carve off a chunk of sodium (which you can do with a
butter knife--it's very soft) and toss it on a puddle.  It
skitters around and burns.  Like phosphorus, once it starts
burning, it's pretty much going to finish no matter what you do.

Storing it in oil (or inside a valve stem) keeps the oxygen away
so it doesn't oxidize (i.e., burn).

Did we just have the discussion on whether sodium-filled valves
are worth it and I missed it?  I've been gone for a few weeks.
I'm planning on rebuilding my 1700 (to be an 1800 at least), and
I don't know where to find sodium-filled valves.  Any sources
out there?

Thanks,
Dennis
