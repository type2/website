&gt;I was wondering what purpose the two holes with welded nuts are for.  I

&gt;of me figure out what the two holes/nuts were for.  Does anyone know?

If they are at the bottom it's for securing a wide 5 tire (5x205) with two lug bolts. It's a universal tire mount: the three studs are for 5x112 (71-79) wheels.
