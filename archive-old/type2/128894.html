Yes, and everyone knows that all of William Shakespeare's plays were 
written by another playwrite with the same name.

&quot;No such thing as suction&quot; is interesting high school physics (sorry 
George), but I've never heard anyone who says that tell me what they 
think suction would be if there were such a thing. Suction is just a 
word that describes a pressure differential. Same thing.
