Subject: Re: [T2] Chassis black

Seth,

Chasis black is *just* paint.  Do the por-15 or powder coating and get
far better protection.

My personal choice would be for por-15 since I care about the protection
more than any possibility that some sun on the beam may fade it a little.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Chassis Black from Eastwood and was wondering if anybody has used this 
&gt; product and how pleased were they with the results?
