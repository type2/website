Hi,

&gt; I'm a new bus owner in the UK. I was wandering if there are any problems
&gt; with running my 75 bay window on lead replacement fuel rather than regular
&gt; leaded petrol which you can no longer get in the UK, or if the lack of
lead
&gt; will lead to overheating?

 Paul, what type of engine do you have. If it's a &quot;pancake&quot; (1700-2000cc
type-4 engine) then you can run regular 95RON unleaded.
 If it's a 1600cc &quot;upright&quot; then things are a little more complicated,
though
you won't get overheating as a result.
 The absence of lead in fuel _may_ result in problems with increased wear
on the valve seats. As I understand it it's not clear that this will
definitely
cause problems for VWs anyway, since they have hardened valve seats by
necessity
of their aluminium cylinder heads. Even if it does it's only likely to be a 
problem under high stress conditions and the residual lead in the engine is 
likely to provide protection for quite a while. Ultimately the valves will
wear out anyway so this may happen a little quicker, or may not. You could
just monitor the wear by keeping track of valve adjustments since recession
of the seat will result in the valves tightening- if you have to loosen
a valve on successive adjustments then it may be failing either as a result
of seat recession or stretching. Either way it's better to fix before it
fails catastrophically.
 Most heads are reckoned to be OK, there are a few uprights which were sold
in
the UK that are regarded as questionable- a reputable VW engine specialist
or your VW dealer may be able to advise.

HTH.

Cheers,
	W.


 Incidentally, Leaded fuel is still available from certain garages. I can't
remember the name of the chain but they have some representation across most
of the UK.
