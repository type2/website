Subject: Re: Taking a federal car into CA

David,
Good news. A court ruling has overturned the previously imposed one-time 
$300 at registration &quot;smog mitigation fee&quot; here in California for 
out-of-state (&quot;49 state&quot;) vehicles. So as far as I know, the smog 
requirements you would have to meet are those for the federal vehicle as 
originally set. The only question still to be answered is whether Sacramento 
is going to return the illegally taken monies all the way back to the early 
nineties when this was imposed, or just try to get away with a 3-year 
statute of limitations refund. I've filed to get mine back and am waiting to 
see (brought in a car in '93 and had to pay it, even though the only 
difference was it lacked a $5 part, and they wouldn't let me add it to avoid 
the fee!).
