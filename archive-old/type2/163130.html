Subject: Re: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

Hmmm...

Where do I start? How about the first sentence in the description: &quot;frame
off ground up complete restoration.&quot;  On a unibody? And the pics... What
part of the interior looks like it has been restored?

Second sentence: &quot;dual webber factory correct&quot; engine. Pic 2 shows the
vacuum line to the dizzy just cut off. What's that? Someone asked the seller
why he hadn't run the engine. His reply was &quot;last night I stabbed the
distributor and she fired right up.&quot; Not sure exactly what he meant by
&quot;stabbed,&quot; but the dizzy was obviously already in the engine.

All new rubber? Obviously not all. I'm pretty certain the steps on the front
bumper are old. Nothing instide was replaced.

All glass replaced? Not with new glass. Where'd he get that rear window with
the defrost grid? How about the vent wing windows?

Factory AC works great? How can you know that if you haven't run the engine?
Factory? Never available from the factory (in the US).

Pic 4: What are those two white tablets in the bottom left corner? Did the
guy drop some of the speed he was on when he painted the van?

WTF with the wiring uinder the dash? Engine compartment has wires hanging
out of it too.

&quot;The seats are in excellent condition.&quot; ??????????


All that aside, this van does have a few things going for it. Number one,
the deluxe trim looks good in the photos. Saphire AM radio. Tires, if
they're the correct rating (my money is that they're not). Headliner looks
good, as do the hinge covers and spare tire cover. Front &amp; rear bumpers
pretty straight (hard to find for this year).

Overall, this is not a restoration, but a sloppy whack job done in poor
taste.

I find it hard to believe the seller has a 95%  positive rating.
