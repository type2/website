&gt;  i'm about to take off my front stablizer bar, in order to get the torsion 
&gt;  arms off. The bentley manual says just replace the clips, but that was 
&gt;  written 20 years ago.  Are they still available, or better yet, is there a 
&gt;  trick to saving them when removing them? If not, is there a trick to 
setting 
&gt; 
&gt;  the new ones, if found, back in place with regular ol' shade tree type 
tools?

Well the Bently manual is right, you just takes 'em off - bend down the tab 
at the wide end of the slide on clip at the bottom of the clamp and hit the 
tab with a large hammer and it just slides off.

These sure are still availlable - I've seen them in the Rocky Mountain Motor 
Works catalogue - they even do them in stainless steel. I guess Bus Depot and 
all the other VW parts dealers sale them just as they do in the UK.

New clips are cheep and your old ones are probably 20 years old so although 
it is possible to renew them they are probably due for a change same applies 
to the rubber too.

while the sway bar is off - at least slide the rubber to the side to inpect 
the bar underneath I had a bar fail with a fatique crack just inside of the 
rubber; there was a exceeding load bang followed by a extreemly noisey 
banging and increased sway as I went round a corner. I thought the whole 
front end had gone for the noise it made!

There is a trick to refitting them as the sides of the clamp need to be drawn 
together before the sliding part can be hammered on. I achieved this useing 2 
pairs of vice grips - put one on the jaws of the clamp tighten the other a 
liitle more and put on the clamp, remove the first pair tighten and repeat - 
when drawn together enough the wide end of the sliding part can be put on by 
hand then whack it with a hammer to slide it on, remove vice grips when half 
way on bend up tap when fully on.

My first clamp took me about 6 hours then I discovered the vice grip trick 
and the second one took 15 minutes.

Good luck
