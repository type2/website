&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the advice.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll have a look at the ignition systanm and the #2 temp sensor and see if that does any good.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem seems to occur when the engine is warm - usually after we
&gt; have been cruising for 80 - 100 km - it then feels as if the whole
&gt; engine dies and comes back to life sometimes forcing us to stop and wait
&gt; a minute or so.  This makes me think of ignition problems before the
&gt; distributor or something else. 

--&gt;  Yes, but this would also be symptomatic of a loose Temp. Sensor
2...it's high resistance when the engine's cold, low when it's hot.  When
it rattles around, it intermittently looks like a high resistance, causing
the engine to go full rich momentarily and miss.  This drove me nuts for a
while, since on the FI engine I had the P.O. had stripped the threads the
sensor screws into.  (see below)

&gt; 
&gt; A couple of questions - if there is an erratic problem like the
&gt; grounding of the #2 temp sensor, will I be able to spot it when the
&gt; problem is not actually happening? 

--&gt;  Maybe not, but all you need to do is put a wrench on it and see if
it's snug.  Don't tighten it too hard -- those threads are aluminum and
strip easy.  Just &quot;snug and a tug&quot;.  While you're at it, you can check the
resistance with an ohmmeter and make sure it's not defective.  They do go
bad on occasion, and it's a cheap part...$15, last I needed one.
