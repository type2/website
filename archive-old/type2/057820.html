Subject: Adjust the Shift linkage

Hi Volks,
	I have  my newly purchased '78 T-2 bus running after a complete tune
up, but it doesn't want to shift out of 2nd and seems to have no 3rd or
4th gear. I can't find any procedures in Muir or Bently for
troubleshooting this problem.  any suggestions?  As always, thanks in
advance for any help.Aloha,   Gary
