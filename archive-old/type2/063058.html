&gt; Here are some tips, isocynates are not anywhere near new or soley relegated
&gt; to POR-15 if indeed that product contains them.  They originated on the auto

&gt; acryllic enamel easily 10-20 years ago now.  Are they dangerous, sure, have
&gt; people been spraying without any masks at all using them for years, sure.
&gt; A smart road is in between.  If I were brushing a product containing them out
&gt; of a can, I'd hardly worry about more than a quality filter style respirator,
&gt; with organic vapor cartrige.  For occasional spraying with them I have used
&gt; such a mask in fact though usually use a better mask from the local paint shop
&gt; custom made for the purpose (refill inserts about $40 a pop).  Now if I were
&gt; really serious, there has been a company in HMN's advertising a total fresh air
&gt; mask system for $369 for some time now, Fastech Corp, 1-800-462-2471.  I am
&gt; likely going to buy one in fact for sand blasting and painting.  Another alternative
&gt; I have been exploring though is rolling my own with one of the new semi-scuba
&gt; style regulators that are out where you &quot;scuba&quot; with an attached high pressure
&gt; air hose run off a teflon ringed compressor.  Any way around it be safe but
&gt; don't flip out and buy $400 worth of protective equipment to brush paint out in
&gt; the open air.
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of POR-15 I have only tried their high heat stuff and have been
&gt; slightly less than satisfied, though admittedly I did not prep the parts as
&gt; suggested.  On the new '85 exhaust I merely removed the factory primer with solvent
&gt; and roughed with steel wool as I had no place to sandblast inside in February.
&gt; The POR-15 has not adhered well whatsoever, but now that I picked up a grit blast
&gt; cabinet I will likely retry the procedure but have been too lazy to take that SOB
&gt; of an exhaust off again.
&gt; 

Home Depot sells a respirator that has a combined organic vapor filter and dust mask
for $34.00. It is designed specifically for paint spraying.
