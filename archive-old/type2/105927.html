&gt; Ive narrowed it down to these choices:

&gt; Bridgestone Dueler A/T 195 75 14 max load 1435			$66
&gt; Firestone Wilderness AT III 27 x 8.5 SR14C max load 1515	$74
&gt; BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A K/O 27x8.5 max load 1515		$89

Only the first two of these have a high enough load rating for a bus,
particularly a loaded Westy,


&gt; The first question is whether to go with
&gt; all-terrain tires...  Also,
&gt; realistically the worst terrain we drive on are dirt roads in state parks
&gt; and we have never had any trouble even with passenger tires.  Is there any
&gt; thing else I should consider about all terrain tires?  Is there any other
&gt; reason to select them over the other options?

Only if you really like noise!

I found that I got stuck faster with aggressive tires than I did with
highway tread tires.  The highway tires can spin without digging a hole.
