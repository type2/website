&gt;IN the lock cylinders you will find a series of thin brass plates that
&gt;control the lock.  The key repositions the plates to unlock the door.  You
&gt;can change the order of the plates to match your ignition key.

Those plates are called &quot;wafers&quot;.
As previously mentioned, insert any key and file them flat.
Leave a few out if you like.
If you feel the urge to examine them, do not work on a table
with carpet on the floor, the springs will be history.
