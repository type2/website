Subject: Re: Dead Stickers: Probable Cause?

&gt; their shows. But I do like some of their music &amp; my wife loves the stickers
&gt; with the bears- mainly because she loves teddy bears. It's too bad that I
&gt; have to be afraid to display a bear sticker on my camper because of police
&gt; attitudes....

Don't think I'm defending harassing people because of their stickers, 
because I think it's contemptible, but the fact is that if there is any 
sticker in the entire universe that is going to be regarded as a flag, 
it's one of those teddy bears, because of their provenance and their 
metaphorical value...
