Subject: `77 EFI controller available

From: &quot;Wakanska&quot; &lt;Wakanska_at_sbcglobal_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where these brain modules can be gotten now? I'd like to
&gt; have a spare, &quot;just in case&quot;.

I've already had one offer for this one.  I don't know which it is, US or
CA, but will get ID number(s) after I attempt to get it out of the bus.

Other offers, Anyone?

I'm also a bit embarrassed that I didn't look in my Haynes, to start with.
There's a really nice picture, several actually, of the EFI Controller with
labels and everything... [hides under bus in shame]

I'll pull it either today or tonight.
