Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Oil Cooler

Lucas is an old racer's trick that has come to the general public.  Lucas
will reduce friction (a main cause of high oil temps) and thus reduce wear
on the engine.  A word of caution, I wouldn't put it in an engine with under
10K on it, or you'll never break in the rings.  I first put Lucas in my
140,000 mile engine before last summer's Cal trip and had a noticeable
difference in cooling and the way it ran.  I've put 25,000 mile on the
engine since.  

The cheapest place I have found Lucas is Auto Zone for about $6.50 a quart.
I add half a quart at oil change, then the other half around 1,000 miles.
Last weekend, going to Lincoln Neb. with my '76 westy and it's now 2 liter
165,000 mile engine, using Lucas and 50w racing oil, with 95 outside temps
at 65mph PULLING A JET SKI, I am seeing 50-60 psi oil pressure at 220-230
oil temps.

&gt;&gt; Your best money spent is to check all sheet metal to make sure it is tight,
&gt;&gt; make sure your engine compartment seal is in good shape and have your engine
&gt;&gt; tuned up with new parts.  Put some good 50 weight racing oil in and a bottle
&gt;&gt; of Lucas oil treatment.  Then make sure you are DRIVING your bus correctly,
&gt;&gt; no lugging or excessive RPM's, keep it as close to 3800 RPM as you can.
&gt; =====================&gt;
&gt; With you on all, but the Lucas oil treatment.
&gt; What is it, what does it do ?
