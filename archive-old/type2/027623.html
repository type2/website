the engine code starts with ED, and I saw in some rebuilding book (not 
bentley) that that was a 2L 1975 engine.  But, this must be a mistake.  I 
will check my bentley when i get home. I have no idea where this bus has 
been or what its been through.  its in real rough shape and has been rigged 
every way possible to keep it on the road.

&gt;there wasn't a 2000cc (1970cc) engine in 1975 is because there wasn't (as
&gt;far a I have seen or heard of).  The 1800 and 2000 are identical in more
&gt;ways than not.  It is most likely that your bus has had a 2.0L installed
&gt;later in life or its 1800 has been upgraded with larger pistons and
&gt;cylinders.  Check the Bentley and your engine code will tell you if indeed
&gt;you have a 76 or later 2.0L.  I think the code is GD, but I'm at work and
&gt;I'm not certain off the top of my head.
