Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Gauges for 16 yr old's mega tour

I'd add an extremely large armed law enforcement
officer to that one, myself, as well as...

Oil pressure
Head and/or oil temp
Voltmeter
Ammeter
Perimeter alarm
Make sure the gas gauge works!
Rev limiter
Speed governor

Hell, if you're going to go, go all out. Personally,
I'd chain my 16-year-old to a post in the garage for
two years before I'd let him go on any sort of &quot;mega
tour&quot; without supervision, but that's MHO.

&gt; I guess if I was sending my kid out the two main
&gt; gauges I'd want him to have
&gt; would be an air bag, and 5ft of fairly unrusted
&gt; crumple zone.
&gt; Just my opinion of course.
