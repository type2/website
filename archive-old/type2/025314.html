&gt; Yes!  I believe Magnesium burns at about 1800 degrees.
&gt; 
&gt; The preferred extinguishing agent,  would be foam!  Since water would cause
&gt; it to explode......

Nope. I did a search on &quot;Class D fire extinguishers.&quot; The extinguishing
agent is sodium chloride--plain old table salt--in a fine powder that's
sprayed onto the fire with a very large nozzle. The salt melts and forms a
cake on your burning magnesium, which chokes out the air.

The extinguisher I found on the Web is an Amerex Model 570, which contains
150 lbs (it comes with a cart to move it) of their special salt mixture.
Said to be effective on magnesium, sodium, potassium, sodium-potassium
alloys, uranium and powdered aluminum.

Amerex also sells a Copper-based extinguishing agent they say the Navy
invented to fight lithium fires. With all the lithium batteries in
electronics these days, I can see why the Navy would need a fire
extinguisher like that. The Amerex 571 has 250 lbs. of extinguishing agent
in it, and both extinguishers have the same tank.

The sand another poster mentioned works too, and I'd imagine a garbage can
full of rock salt and a shovel would do the trick too.
