&gt; Well, my top pops straight up also.  There is a
&gt; luggage rack over the
&gt; driver, and the rest of the roof pops up.  There is
&gt; a bed with another board
&gt; that can be slid forward to make for a huge sleeping
&gt; area.
&gt; 
&gt; Back seat folds down and extends the area the over
&gt; engine are to make
&gt; another bed.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a propane stove and a fridge.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a plate on the side of van that I just
&gt; noticed that reads
&gt; something along the lines of
&gt; Manufactured by: Automotive Services
&gt; 2001 W. 4th Plain
&gt; Vancouver, WN
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure but I am guessing WN is supposed to be
&gt; Washington, even though
&gt; I know Washington to be WA.  Mapquest shows this to
&gt; be a valid address, but
&gt; I don't know if they actually did the conversion or
&gt; if they are still there.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all.
