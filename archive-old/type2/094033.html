Subject: fuel line replacement a go!

First off, many thanks to Karl and Dave Bolen for their thoughts while I bought parts:

7.5mm high pressure NBR fuel line (3 meters)

3/8&quot;/9.5mm low pressure fuel line (1 foot)

(10mm line would have to be ordered by the meter at 18.00 per meter and I need 4 inches, which the guy gave me for free. Am I messing up real bad here over .5mm?)

fuel filter

mercedes benz style fuel line clamps (10) need more?

7.5mm fuel line grommet thru fire wall

fuel injection system cleaner (berrymans brand any thoughts?)

fuel injector seal kit (4)

(the mechanic who sold me the line is a jag guy from the UK. he said not to even mess with the injectors to test spray patters or to change the seals if I don't suspect anything's wrong. he said to listen to them with a probe and make sure they were clicking regularly, not thumping. any thoughts?)

Thanks everybody, this will be one of the bigger prev. maint. jobs I've done and I'm really looking forward to hearing your ideas before I go this weekend.

Later,

Billy
