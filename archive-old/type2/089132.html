Subject: Pulling Plug Wires

Maybe a dumb-sounding question, but........

I've read a lot of posts that say to remove the plug wires one at a time
while the engine is running to see if any one wire makes a difference in the
idle. Where are you pulling the wire? At the plug end? The distributor cap
end? Somewhere else I'm not aware of? And what do you use to insulate
yourself from the 'bite'?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Thanks,
Dave
