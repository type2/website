David,

Can you please tell me what the difference is between the &quot;deluxe&quot; and
&quot;regular&quot; versions of the '79 Westfalia?  I'm new to this whole
Volkswagen
thing and am trying to educate myself as much as possible about the
Westfalias.

Have you ever heard of the &quot;Champaign Edition&quot; of the Westfalia?  How
does
it compare with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version?

Thanks in advance for whatever info/advice/help you can send my way.

David
