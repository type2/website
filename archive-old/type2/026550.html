Help!  I want to replace the bushings on the rear trailing arms (referred to
in Bentley's as 'diagonal arms').  The one on the right looks deformed and
the wheel on that side has always sat just a little funny.  

But I can't find this part listed anywhere.  My Haynes manual says they were
vulcanized into the arm and so replacement means new arms.  But no one sells
new arms either.  Am I SOL or does someone know where I can get the parts?

Thanks for any and all suggestions!
