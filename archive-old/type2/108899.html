Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Children in a T2 camper ?

A kot ! That would be an interesting option !
But where do you keep the kot when not using it ?

What kind of space is there in the pop-top ? Is it a bed ?
I really need to go looking for a nice T2 soon.

Summer is almost over here... :)

Regards
Oscar

&gt;  &gt; I guess that there are not 4 sleeping places for mom, dad and two kids
? Or
&gt;  &gt; are there ?
&gt;  &gt; Or is a fronttent (how do you guys call that..:)) neccesary for this?
&gt;
&gt; I think there are cots suitable for children available that mount in the
&gt; front seat area.  Older children would probably do great (and have a
&gt; fantastic time) sleeping in the pop-top.
