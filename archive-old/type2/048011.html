Hello Everyone!

     I'm going to buy Steve Blackham's wheels, and I was wondering if
I'm going to have any problems putting them on my bus? Its a 79' bus,
with 205 70 r14 tires(which I'll be putting on these wheels). Will I
have any clearance problems in my rear wheel wells?
Any info will be great
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
