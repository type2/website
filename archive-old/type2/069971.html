The temperature of the burning gas is way higher than that of the heat
generated from friction.  True, this heat is distributed more widely than
the heat in the combustion chamber, but I'm sure if you take the (heat)
energy in a unit of gas it is much higher than the (heat) energy produced
by friction.  In fact, it is probably much higher.  Engines are very
inefficient, I'm sure less than 30% efficient.  Nearly all, of the gas
gets burned, so where is the extra energy (heat) going? Some is lost
turning the alternator, some is lost moving the valves, but most of this
lost energy is in the form of heat from friction.  I have the numbers
somewhere, but gasoline has a lot of stored energy.  If our cars converted
all of this energy to forward motion, our buses would move at 200 miles an
hour and get 100 miles per gallon.

As far as the alternator, it was a bad example.  Feel your transmission
after a long drive.  Very hot.  No combustion either.
