Subject: Happy 2k y'all

Happy New Year folks... (Although mine doesn't hit for another 2.5 hrs.)

    No bus content here, but I can offer some geek y2k humor, so what the 
heck...

    Screenshots of Apple Computer and BBC Radio homepages, a little over 
2 hours past GMT (most servers run on GMT, and translate to local time, 
so Y2K essentially happened around 4PM PST). The BBC has regressed to 
1900, while Apple is way ahead of the times as usual. You see, it's the 
year 20100 as far as Apple's concerned...   ;-) Also, 2600_dot_com went down 
with a rather funny message...
