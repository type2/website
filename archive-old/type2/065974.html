&gt; This winter will be the time to replace the front floor of the crew cab.  To
&gt; all of you who have replaced the front floor, how hard is it to get out?  I
&gt; assume the steering column, parking brake, shifter, and all pedals need to
&gt; be removed.  How many welds need to be broken?

I cheated and made slots for mine...

Do you have the replacement piece yet?  I haven't seen a replacement (repro) 
piece that covers the size of the area you describe.
 
&gt; I also have a nose dent by the floor that needs to be pounded out - would it
&gt; be better to do this with the floor out or in?

Unless you are going to take the whole bus apart, it doesn't matter.  There
are a couple other pieces that will also be in your way...

&gt; And one more simple question - what's a &quot;dogleg&quot;?  Is it the inner fender
&gt; piece that the '68-'72 bumper step is bolted to?

Yes, the area on the body beneath the door.
