Subject: Re: [T2] Megasquirt Conversion

Wouldn't one need all of the other stuff off of the FI system?  Such as the AFM, injectors, sensors, hoses, wiring, etc.?  I don't have any of the original parts off of my bus.  What else would I need in addition to the MS controllers, etc.?  I have a '76 bus with a 1.7 single Weber in it now.  No FI remnants at all.  Now what's it going to cost???  Thanks...KR

The V3 board with the MSII processor kit is $243.  You'll probably also 
want to get the stimulator for testing ($45).  While not required, the 
relay board is extremely helpful as it has all the needed relays and 
makes hooking up easy ($65).  Other than that, you just need wire to 
connect everything and a laptop for tuning.  A WB02 sensor is very 
helpful for tuning ($200 for LC-1).  You'll need to get one or two 
sensors at around $10 each.  I'm going to try setting up a trigger wheel 
on the back-side of my fan with a pickup ($40 used) instead of using the 
distributor.  My goal is to allow the MS to control spark and fuel. 
*That* is going to be cool!
