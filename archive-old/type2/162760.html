Subject: Re: [T2] coil kaplueee

Bob,

Betting that you have fried the coil.  :-((

Coil will get hot if you just leave the ignition on...and yes, I have 
fried one that way too....walked off and forgot ignition was on for about 
45 minutes.

Ok, down to the real nitty gritty(frothy beverage in hand).

Coil only needs a make and break to ground from the points side to make a 
spark.

unplug pertronix and everything else on the coil.

Run hot wire directly to coil.

run a piece of wire from points side of coil and momentarily touch it to 
ground and then back from ground.

Make spark?  Try it with a different coil.

Cheers, dave

&gt;&gt;&gt; getting nothing from the coil, no spark at all.......
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just to double check all bases, are you still getting 12v to the coil?
&gt;
&gt; yup nice and hot
&gt;
&gt; thanks
