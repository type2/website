You will get no public argument from me for your hammering. I lived more than 20 years in
the Dallas area working (and camping) all over Texas in outside jobs and know how overnight
temps can drift upward from seasonal norms there 
at times.

I also do my share of camping on the Florida peninsula Gulf Coast which is notoriously the 
buggiest, muggiest, most oppressively uncomfortable place to camp in summer. It gets so bad 
here many Florida State Parks lower their prices. I still won't bother with A/C in my bus.

My situation differs from yours in that:

1. I am responsible for no one's comfort but my own (key point).
2. I am retired and able to adjust my climate by turning my bus key.

To those in situations similar to yours with spouses, families, and ordinary vacation windows, 
&quot;silly&quot; was an insensitive and insulting word to use to describe my view of 
installing a window-shaker A/C unit in a VW bus.

My public apologies for that.
