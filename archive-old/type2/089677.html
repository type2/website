Subject: Re: [T2] flaky panelling

&gt;&gt; i have a 1970 westy with the wood panelling overhead. there is, i have
&gt;&gt; to guess, old varnish or something flaking off the ceiling and wall
&gt;&gt; panels. any time anyone touches it, it sticks to them and is difficult
&gt;&gt; to get off. i have tried a wet cloth to wipe the stuff off, but it
&gt;&gt; just gets all

My '74 was the same when when I first got it. I took the top cabinet out
of the back (four bolts) and slid all the panels out. I then sanded then
down and stained them. Took all of about three hours and looks fantastic -
probably better than new. It's surprisingly easy, just take your time.

I'm actually looking to buy some more of this panelling to cut new door
panels so it matches.

-Eric
