Actually your entire bus is a vital part of your new Homeland Security
Terrorism Protection system. You may now refer to it as your self contained
&quot;incident evacuation vehicle&quot;. All you need to do is throw some extra
clothes, a couple jugs of water, and some canned food in the back and your
all set. Rendezvous point for evacuees will be the HCBF campsite.
