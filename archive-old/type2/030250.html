&gt; I've used George's method several times.  It always works for me. 
&gt; One thing I always do so that I don't have to do it again on the same
&gt; adjuster is to thinly coat the star, bolt and cup that the star goes
&gt; in with high temperature grease.  There's supposed to be a special
&gt; lubricant for brakes but I've never tried it.  Use it sparingly.  You
&gt; don't want to have it drip on to the drums and shoes.

I use anti-sieze grease.  Seems to work, though I live in a relatively
benign area, corrosion-wise.
