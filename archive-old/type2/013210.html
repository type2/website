&gt;&gt; This is to let you know that in the background there have been a batch 
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; changes recently in the non-structure that is type2_dot_com.

Then Ken said:

&gt;I want to thank Steve Dolan from the bottom of my heart for all he's 
&gt;done for us. In addition to being a superb admin, Steve has been 
&gt;carrying a GREAT DEAL of the site's financial burden for a very long 
&gt;time. I'm not supposed to tell that but I don't care. Steve is a man of 
&gt;wisdom and grace and judgement and incredible generosity, we are very 
&gt;lucky to have had him for as long as we did.

I want to second this as well, I was about to mention it myself,
if no-one else brought this up.  I asked Steve about a YEAR ago how
much money we had left and he mentioned we had run out of money
a while back.  He payed that monthly bill personaly folks, and although
not a bum off the street I know he ain't personally wealthy.  Steve knows
I think he is one of the greatest most generous people I've ever meant, with
his time and with his money.  I give him hell but there are few people I know
I can count on like him.  He has been a bit of a grouch for these last few
years of his tender as co-admin though, so maybe that will improve 8-)  I
tried the job on for about 2 weeks back when I was just starting med
school and rapidly realized there was no way in the world I'd put up
with the crap and work that goes with the job.  I have infinite respect
for Gerry, Ken, Steve, and all the new guys.

I al$o want to $ay when the time come$ volk$ it$ time to anty up already.
A$k your$elf how much time at $50/hour labor and money have you
$aved following thi$ li$t.

Certainly worth $50 of my money for the last 3-4 years.
