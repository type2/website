Subject: looking for K and N filter part number for a Kadron carb

------=_NextPart_000_00A5_01C22778.7370DB50
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I can't seem to find the right site for this info.  I have an older set =
of Kads, and my current filters are those old timey ones that have like =
a perforated steel around a paper filter........they have had =
it...........

The filters the car currently has are 5 1/2 inches wide (O.D.) and are =
about 3 1/8 &quot; tall.   These dimensions are key for otherwise the tops to =
the filters will not bolt down............

ANY help is appreciated.  Would prefer K N even thought they may cost a =
little more.........
