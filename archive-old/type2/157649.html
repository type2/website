&gt; folks, i need two side markers for a 72. the rear red

I got mine from Ronnie at Old Volks Home in Havasu.  They are OK
reproductions, but I had to drill out the clips that normally hook the
bulb-holder to the body and use nylon screws to attach them.  The plastic
clips just wouldn't attach to the body.

They come with either silver or black rims, depending upon the year of
your bus.
