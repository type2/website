&gt;  the answer is &quot;yes and no&quot;

Snip
&gt;the nose cone, the bell
&gt;housings are slightly different ('78 has hanger bolt holes, '80 does not
&gt;(this may not make a difference, it may interfere with the body)), the '78
&gt;does not have holes to mount the clutch slave cylinder (I don't even think
the bosses are there, but they could be welded on, of course).

I agree I just took a close look at both units.  Different carrier, 
nose cone, diff, etc.  I want to keep the 78 anyway for my 77, just 
in case. Now I just need to find a  good rebuilt 83 (83.5 were 
waterbaxer).

Thanks for the help
