The screwdriver out of an eyeglass repair kit($1.49 at the drug store
checkout) fits this screw perfectly.

&gt; One can also use a latch from a 72-79 beetle- the finger part that hangs
down
&gt; is just a little longer. What's this about $ 80 latches? That's insane-
I'd
&gt; screw gun the thing shut first. As for rekeying, it's not a pin, it's a
very
&gt; tiny flathead setscrew- clean the threadlock/ goo out of the head(it has
to
&gt; be in the unlocked position to do this- to find it, push down halfway) and
&gt; unscrew it, then put a key of the same blank in and wiggle, it'll pull
out.At
&gt; that point. you'll either be able to figure it out, or you'll know someone
&gt; who can switch the wafers for you.   Ed
