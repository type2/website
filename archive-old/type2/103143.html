Subject: Oil (was: VW Trends)

Hi Folks,

I don't want to start yet another long thread about dino vs synthetic oil, 
as the archives are already pretty full of stuff like this.

However, it would seem to me that synthetic oil these days would be as good 
or better than dino oil.  First, the oil manufacturing technology has been 
around for about 25 years, so I'd imagine that it's pretty well nailed down. 
  Mainly, though, I'd think that a machine manufactured by people would work 
better with an oil manufactured by people, rather than an oil manufactured 
by nature.  Tolerances, viscosities, breakdown points, etc. have all been 
worked through by engineers -- similar people to those who work through all 
the same stuff for engines ... right?

I've been using Mobil 1 in my Raby-built engine since the break-in period 
was over.  It's powerful and it runs a little hot, so I like the comfort of 
having a high-temp oil breakdown point.  I have full-flow filtration as 
well, so I change every 3K or so -- not too much waste, and the added cost 
of synthetic doesn't seem excessive for an investment such as an engine.

As always, YMMV.  As someone else said, &quot;Your bus, your decision.&quot;
