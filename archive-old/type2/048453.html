Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof

&gt; You have to weld in tabs at the back end of the assembly to make the roof
lift
&gt; up when fully closed.  You'll probably need to look at a sunroof bus to
get
&gt; the right shape.  You also need to install drain tubes.  If you don't the
rain
&gt; will leak into you bus, more like rain in your bus, causing rusting from
the
&gt; inside out.
&gt;
&gt; PS Any one looking for sunroof cables I have a set for sale.  Make offer.
I
&gt; am in South Carolina but will ship.

what exactly does this mean, and what are the tabs you are talking about,
were are they exactly? Also what can be done about the drain holes? I just
recently took out a sunroof from a bus to put in my 71 westy and need new
cables and the plastic cable guides at the front. Any help/advice would be
appreciated.
