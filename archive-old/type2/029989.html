&gt; &gt; I did mine this week and I took the bus to a guy with a lift. I kept
&gt; &gt; thinking what a huge chore this would have been on my back in the driveway.
&gt; &gt; All the bolts were mucked up and had to be cleaned to get them out.
&gt; 
&gt; Ric, Luis:
&gt; Yeah, a LIFT, what a concept! I worked at a shop when I was 16 that had 3!!
&gt; (That was 35 years ago and there WERE NO CV JOINTS on Vw's in 1966!) I've
&gt; changed a lot of them lying on the ground in the meantime.

Otoh, if you do it with the suspension somewhat compressed it makes it a
lot easier to start all those bolts into their threaded holes in the
flanges.  I use a small floor jack and carefully jack beneath the shock
mount.  Since the shock mount is behind the axle, this gives a greater
torque on the torsion bar and compresses the suspension a bit more.  I
just barely lift the tire off of the ground so I can rotate the axle to
get at all the bolts and then hold the tire with my knee to torque the
bolts.  That way I can do them all at one time.

Needless to say, I block all three remaining wheels securely before
working under the bus supported in this manner.  With the wheel on, if the
jack fails the bus won't drop, since the wheel will simply drop a quarter
inch or so to the ground

&gt; Ric touched on something very important: Clean out the sockets of the socket
&gt; head screws. I use a baby straight blade screwdriver. dig it out till it comes
&gt; out clean. Next, use a 6mm allen (or corresponding correct size triple square)
&gt; Snap-on or mac or Matco Quality 3/8 adapter and an air impact wrench. This is
&gt; one place where an air impact (and the right allen adapter) is PRICELESS.

Well, no it's pretty darned pricy!  Someday when I'm either wealthy or
making my living by working on VWs...

&gt; You
&gt; don't ever want to find out how much trouble it is to get one of these bolts
&gt; out
&gt; if you round out the  socket head screw. Cutting torch time!!

No, it's big vise-grips time!  If you really can't budge the bolts, drill
the heads off as described below for the Vanagon.  No sense in risking
damage to those expensive CVs.

 Even worse on the
&gt; outers of a Vanagon because it's inside the trailing arm.

Get a drill a bit larger than the shank of the bolt.  Drill the head of
the bolt off by drilling straight into the socket.

&gt; I will add, that if they start making noise, and you're no where near a place to
&gt; fix them, I've cut a small incision in the boot and lubed them with spray grease
&gt; and bought over 20,000 miles. I change the boots always when I re-lube them
&gt; anyway, so the incision is not a big deal to me. Might feel differently if I was
&gt; in the desert in the midst of a lot of sand.

My Rockford boots have the old-style clamp on the flange side of the boot.
I replaced the crimp clamp with a narrow worm drive hose clamp.  Adding
lube is just a matter of loosening the clamp and prying the boot from the
flange.  Not all that hard to do, but be sure to clean everything first so
that dirt won't find its way into the lube.
