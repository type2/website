Here on my side of the Saint Croix/Missippi Rivers RV plates are less than 
car plates and Historic Vehicle plates are even less than that.  I have RV 
plates on mine as do a lot of others that I know.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;     Wanted to take a Friday opportunity to share  a unique (to me) DMV 
thing.
&gt;     Went to the DMV to register my newly acquired 79 Westy.  Instead of 
&gt;  getting regular car (or truck) plates- Ms. DMV hands me &quot;motorhome&quot; 
plates. 
&gt; I 
&gt;  explain that this is not a class A land yacht- just a small VW bus.   
&gt;  Besides, everyone I know with a Westy has regular car plates. 
&gt;     She tells me that because it can be used as a &quot;temporary dwelling&quot;, it 
is 
&gt; 
&gt;  now classified as a motorhome. 
&gt;       BTW- I didn't tell them that it was a westy, but apparently some PO 
&gt; must 
&gt;  have titled it as a motorhome or something. This is the only way I figure 
&gt;  they would have known. I don't know which plates PO had on it.
&gt;      This is a bummer for 2 reasons. First off, you surely know that 
&gt; motorhome 
&gt;  plates are more expensive to get and maintain registration.  But secondly- 
&gt;  these plates in WI here are QUARTERLY. That means that the plates I just 
got 
&gt; 
&gt;  expire in March already!  Car plates are yearly, of course.
&gt;      I have two ways out of this. I can either get &quot;collector&quot; plates, 
which 
&gt;  will cost more money, plus are more expensive for a &quot;motorhome&quot;, or, I can 
&gt;  somehow convince them to let me use regular car plates. 
&gt;     Anyone else have to title their Westy as a camper? Or did I manage to 
&gt; find 
&gt;  the one witty DMV worker here?
