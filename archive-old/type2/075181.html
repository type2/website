Subject: [T2] tapping noise in newly rebuilt engine

&gt;  I just wanted to get some thoughts about a loud tapping noise in our newly
&gt;rebuilt engine.
&gt; It starts making this noise only after the engine is warmed up. It
&gt;is a 78 hydraulic valved bus,but I don't think it is the valves because it
&gt;does not make this noise at startup.

Could be a loose valve seat. Normally, serious noises will be there
hot or cold, but with engine heat as a parameter, fewer choices.
Try a compression test with a fully warm engine.
