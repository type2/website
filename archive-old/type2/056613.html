Subject: re: Smog in CA

&gt; Hello everyone! I just got a 73 bus and I live in Cali, does anyone
know
&gt; the last year that doesn't have to be smogged by chance?  I heard it
was
&gt; 73 but it wasn't from a reliable source.  Thanx

Dustin,

Jim Thomas &lt;jim_at_oldvolkshome_dot_com&gt; originally posted the following
message. Just as a point of reference, SB42 which was passed here in CA
last year, and took effect on January 1 of this year states (paraphrased
by Jim) the following:

1973 and EARLIER vehicles are exempt from all regulations regarding
automotive emissions controls from January 1, 1998 thru December 31,
2003.
Period.

Beginning on January 1, 2004, vehicles 30 years and older are exempt
from
smog inspections.  Each succeeding year advances the exemption, ie:

2004	1974
2005	1975
2006	1976
2007	1977
2008	1978
2009	1979

and so on, and so on, etc.

This includes Registrations, Re-Registrations, Ownership Transfers,
Roadside Inspections and sniffers.

However, if one of those on-ramp sniffers says you're a &quot;Gross
Polluter&quot;,
you must take it in for at least a sniff test - a visual inspection is
not
required.
