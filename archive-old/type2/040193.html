Subject: Accel. Cable Help.

What's up? I have a 68 Westy and the Accel. cable broke off at the
pedal. I've changed these in other VW's but they were water-cooled.
Which way do I pull it through? Any tricks?What's the best type of
lube?Any pointers will help out a bunch.  Anybody going to the show in
Vallejo, Ca. tomororow(Sunday the 21`st)?
Thanks,
Casey
