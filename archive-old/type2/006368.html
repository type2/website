Subject: Re: tar in gas tank
Date: Sun, 21 Mar 1999 18:28:21 -0500



&gt;I've seen this before in junk yard busses -- black gooey tar-like
&gt;substance slowly (imperceptibly) oozing out of the gas outlet (and, in
&gt;the case of this fuel injected vehicle, out of the return inlet too).
&gt;I'm assuming this is a product of old long bad gasoline
&gt;
&gt;BTW, what am I supposed to do with the bad gasoline that drained
&gt;(slowly!)
I fought this battle with the Turtle.  It had been sitting at least six
years and no gas was coming out.  I started pulling fuel lines and yellow
gas and targoo drizzled out, sloooowly.  The answer was to remove all the
fuel lines and tossem. Then remove the hexnut plug where the tank feeds.  A
screen type filter lives underneath, and is plugged with goo.  Make sure you
have a big funnel and gas cans ready.  The tank will drain along with the
goo.  Then with the bottom still open I sprayed a big can of gumout into the
gas filler.  A couple of flushes with the old dirty gas, with the goo
strained out, and the tank is probably pretty clean.  As for the dirty gas,
I mixed about a gal. at a time into a nearly full 20 gal tank in my pickup.
Diluted like that with good gas, it just burned away.  That's the
environmently correct method IMO.
