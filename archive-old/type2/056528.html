Subject: Speedo replacement

The speedo in my 70 Westy has been wildly inaccurate for years--reads 85
mph plus at highway speeds.  If I'm going 85 then everyone else is doing
110, because I'm not passing anybody :)

So I decided it was time to do something about the problem. Took the entire
speedo/clock unit out of the 71 parts bus. There are only a few screws
holding the backing plate to the dash unit, and after taking them off the
the fuel gauge warning light assembly and speedo are accessible. I did the
same with the unit out of mine. I swapped both the speedo and the fuel
gauge (in an effort to cure a serious case of fuel gauge needle
jump--easier than replacing the sending unit).

Put the thing back in and suddenly I know how fast I'm going. Whole job
took maybe an hour.

One tip: Number all the wires on the backside of the instrument panel
before you take them off. There are about 10 connections back there, easy
to get them mixed up. I put little tape tags on the wires and used a magic
marker to number the receptacles. That way the numbers will still be there
the next time I have to take this thing apart again.

I've seen speedo units for sale cheeeep at many a swap meet, so there's
really no need to be guessing how fast you are going. Though I do miss the
hairy-chested machismo of pointing out my buried speedo to passengers...
