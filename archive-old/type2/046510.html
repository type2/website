Subject: [T2] if you were/are a mechanic, would it bother you????

Ok, so im a fairly new bus owner, lets get that out of the way.

My bus rocks, no real major issues thus far, but I want to start doing the 
points, valve jobs, misc maitenence myself when I can, but I simply dont 
have the mechanical knowledge to really feel all that comfortable using even 
the Muir guide to tackle it all by myself the first time.

What im thinking is this : maybe I could pay someone to do these things to 
my bus the next time they are do (which is soon, im going on another trip 
over ol Mt Shasta in a few weeks) and a little extra to learn as they go???

Im in the San Francisco area, and there are a number of people here that 
will work on the old type2 but usually would rather not touch anything older 
than 1980, so maybe they would be happy to teach, get payed, and not 
bothered about it again?

I guess im looking for a 'keep it runnin' lesson, and im willing to pay 
someone to show me. Im new to the coast otherwise id be calling on the 
friends that used to help me out to come over and show me already. I just 
dont know where to turn, and maybe getting a mechanic to show me will be the 
best bet?

I just dont want to ask if its something that I should know will piss them 
off. Or if you know a really nice person in the bay area, who will pass on a 
little knowledge for payment of their time and a few beers, let me know!


in the real rat race, the cheese is poisoned,
so take your time!

Oh, and the BBC was in town doing a story about the club scene here in san 
francisco, and I happen to do that sort of thing. Long story short - they 
are going to have about 5 full minutes if futage of me and my friends 
cruzing around in my bus all over san francisco. Ill let you guys know when 
to watch, they really loved my bus. &quot;Id love to get some shots of you blokes 
drivin around in the kombi!&quot; - BBC director
