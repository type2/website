When you have 165,000 miles on your engine I'll listen more intently.  You 
also failed to mention the year of your bus.  There is a large difference 
between the type 4 and type 1 engines and also between the early and late 
type 4's.  The original post was from an owner of a '71, the same year bus 
I've been driving for the last 18 years.  I have put well over 200,000 miles 
on this bus and have made my share of mistakes, euphemistically know as 
learning experiences.  George Lyle, who also responded to this thread and 
owns a '71 said his bus is happiest at 58 MPH as is mine.  And I can 
document cylinder head and oil temps, but it seems you don't but much value 
on them. 
You may have an exceptional engine.  You may be driving a 2 L bus.  You may 
be exceptionally lucky.  But common knowledge and the experience of large 
numbers of people say a '71 bus driven at 70 MPH consistently wont last.  
Busses have lots of head/exhaust valve problems.  These are caused by too 
much heat.  Driving a '71 bus at 70 MPH is equivalent to driving any other 
car at full, or near full throttle all the time.  And remember there is no 
temperature gauge in a bus, just a little light that comes on when oil 
pressure is below about 2-3 PSI.  
If you want your type 1 bus to last keep your top speed around 60 MPH.
