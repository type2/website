Subject: hankooks

just received my hankook 185 r75cs today at 5:40 pm via ups.  should be
installed tuesday.  then, coupled with my new front shocks i'll have a new
feeling ride.  put on sachs shocks. much softer than my gas adjust.  quick
question.  because the shocks were painted over by PO i don't know if the
rear shocks are gas adjust.  is it dangerous to have oil filled up front and
gas adjust on the back end?  i guess i'll try to scrape some paint and see
what they are.
