Robert,

Give Walter at *The Bus Boys- 800-792-2697* a try, I think he can get it for
you.   Or,  he can proly have one custom made for you, with the correct
color coded wires.

Subject: wiring harness for 70


&gt; I posted awhile ago about needing a wiring harness for a 70 standard. A
few
&gt; people replied (thank you) but I couldn't find what I was looking for: a
&gt; complete, new loom for my 70.  It seems impossible to find and even the
few
&gt; wiring shops I've talked with were reluctant to sell me anything but the
&gt; main loom.  My poor bus is in dire need of wire - the PO replaced every
wire
&gt; with a makeshift one of his own.  A complete mess and hazard.   Any help
&gt; would greatly be appreciated.
