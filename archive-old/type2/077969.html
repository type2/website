Ric,
You can get the heads semi-hemi cut to remove a few ccs, then make up the
difference with shims if need be.  I have some heads with almost 60cc
volume in them and didn't run any shims on that engine.  I think most
times the volumes run 52-56ccs on semi-hemi cut depending on how much
material they take out for 85.5 bore.  Supposedly you can run more advance
on semi-hemi heads as well.
