Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

&gt;From: scott lyons they are not &quot;the same&quot;.

&gt;any time you get into mixing and matching engine components, things get
&gt;complicated in a hurry. there are so simple answers to the questions you 
&gt;are
&gt;asking. that is not to say that some of the things you are talking about
&gt;cannot be done, but it would be irresponsible to say &quot;this works&quot; or &quot;this
&gt;will not&quot;. it all just really depends on a lot of variables.

There were a few no answers in there...but I agree and I was confused about 
the difference.

&gt;there is a very good reason that most people end up building a bone stock
&gt;engine with original spec parts, and that is because the combination has
&gt;been worked out by someone else. if you mix and match parts like camshafts
&gt;and heads you will end up with a mongrel beast which may or may not be a
&gt;tunable, tractable machine.

Whoah now I am not going to mix and match parts if the are not the same or 
interchangable without modification(that would not be interchangable, just 
changable). I am going to upgrade and I guess what I should have asked is 
what is not interchangable between them.

&gt;do some research on a site like shoptalkforums_dot_com, in the type4um. they
&gt;have a searchable archive and it may have answers to some of your 
&gt;questions.

I was just looking for general information and that is why I asked the list. 
If someone sends me a reply that is unclear I usually post my acceptance of 
it as true or reply to it to the list for a second chance at confirmation. 
Look it worked again. &quot;They are not the same.&quot; Thanks for your help.
