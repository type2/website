Subject: Re: Carb balance tube

I still think I have the right part for you - let me look for a picture and 
we'll go from there.

I'll keep this line safe for you.  'til we decide you do or don't want it.

I think Bentley may have the picture we need to communicate. Once again it 
would be nice to have a digital camera. Maybe next century... &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;not sure what you mean by 3 nipples in the middle.  as I recall it has a 
&gt;little round metal mixture thingy in the middle....2 pipes (attached) head 
&gt;off to the left carb and one pipe heads off to the right carb.  one of the 
&gt;left carb pipes sticks up higher than the other 2 lower pipes.  greg

&gt;&gt;Yeah - sounds like the same one.

&gt;&gt;Two ends for the carbs and two (three?) nipples in the middle.

&gt;&gt;  It is unmolested, unharmed good condition. Brackets for the bolts that 
&gt;&gt; hold it are intact.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you want it it is yours for the price of shipping or you can stop by 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and pick it up.
