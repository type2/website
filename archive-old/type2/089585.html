Evening Everyone!

On the type2 irc server we now have a bot that has about 3000 volkswagen
part numbers, searchable. However, obviously, there are more parts then
that! So what I am looking for is flat text files that contain part
numbers and descriptions.  I dont want prices, but having the years
applicable would be handy. Even if the part is discontinued.

As far as format, I dont care. Comma delimited is cool, but I'll worry
about filtering it once I see it. The important part is that its text
only. I have very limited access to things like MS-Excel or Word. 

Thanks in Advance!

Tyler
