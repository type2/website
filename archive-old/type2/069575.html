Me wonders what condition the &quot;dime-sized zoobee&quot; would be in when applied
to even the most conservative summer driving in Phoenix or other SW USA
desert spots. At what temperature does the dime thing melt the center?

Larry (at GEX) put a small disk, about the size of a dime on the engine for
abuse detection... If the engine is overheated, the center of the disk
melts. This shows weather the engine has been mistreated or not.
