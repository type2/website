Subject: RE: [T2] almost up in smoke

Glad it turned out well; I had a gas leak recently (posted a couple weeks
ago). For future reference, the only ignition sources in the bus that are
hot enough to ignite gasoline are electrical sparks and hot exhaust leaks. I
guess it's  possible that a really hot catalytic converter could ignite
gasoline, but it's ingition temp would be above 500 F. Once you have the
vehicle shut off (including all electrical accessories) all you have to
worry about is cleaning up the mess.

'77 Westy &quot;Pumpkin II&quot;


&lt;SNIP&gt;
Hi all,

just wanted to share the BAD experience I had this weekend:
Some weeks ago my 2liter dual carb (solex standard) '78 westy was smelling
of gas.
Stopped, checked everything (Done two years ago: new fuel lines, clamps and
secured the clamps like it's shown in the archive.).
No dripping, everything looked clean and dry. Checked twice and finally
drove on.
The smell came in unregular intervals, I checked everything about one
hundred times, couldn't find anything. Bought myself a new fire extinguisher
