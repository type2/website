Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges

i have a question on this line.
the bus i bought has an oil pressure gauge mounted to the left under the
dash. unfortunately, it is not hooked up. i just recently got the engine
rebuilt (engine was dismantled when i bought it) and reinstalled, but the
oil pressure gauge is not hooked up. how and where does one hook it to
the engine?
