Subject: Re:Advice on buying VW bus's?

Hey Alex,

this could give a long long story, but I'll keep it short.

Some years ago (I think it was just only 22 years ago) I bought a 58 split
for about 200 US$. I was in my early twenties then, repaired it, used it,
repaired it again - and I love it up to now.

I learned to accept the infernal noise, the bad back, the freezing on cold
days, the little room inside, the hours to come from A to B.

Back in '92 I've got a '88 vanagon, suprised how warm, fast and comfortable
a bus can be.

In '95 I changed to a '77 westy, thats in my opinion the best bus. Not too
slow, not too cold, but comfortable enough to use it in modern traffic (we
have no speed-limits here on our Autobahns). And - the aircooleds are easier
to repair and cheaper and easier to keep them roadworthy.

My opinion: Buy the best bus you can get for your budget, it's easier to
keep it alive than to repair a heap of scrap. My '77 was in the 2,5k region
and much much better and more original than the '58 was after all repairs.
Be patient to find a really good one. I didn't want one in '95 and it jumped
directly into my garage.

Best wishes,
Michael from germany

58 split (the last one to sell)
77 westy (the one we really use every summer)
