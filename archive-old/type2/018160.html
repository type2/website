The procedure is described in the 17th edition (and perhaps others) of
Muir.  Look under the electrical chapter at the end of the book.  I
think it can be done for under $10.  

Another option is to make your stereo easy to take out.  Most new
stereos come with a bracket that you bend prongs out of to fix it into
the dash.  Don't do that, and if a thief comes along and wants your
radio, then at least he doesn't have to destroy your dash in the
process.  Of course you do have to find some way to &quot;fix&quot; the stereo so
that it doesn't shake or vibrate too much when you're driving (maybe
some foam?).

The other option of course is to get a theft deterent radio, such as one
with a removable faceplate.  Not a guarantee, but more likely to be left
unmolested, especially if you don't do something stupid like leave the
face on it (or in the glovebox).  A bit of a pain, but less expensive
than replacing a radio.

Just a few thoughts.
