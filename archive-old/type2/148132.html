Subject: Re: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie
  gathering!

There's kind of a neo-hippy movement among the younger generation,
bell-bottoms, 60's music, etc. Quite a few of this set are the ones
driving by in their late model cars flashing a peace sign and
enthusiastically gawking as they pass you. It's sort of and envy
thing. The trouble with the turn-on, tune-in, drop-out mentality of
some of these is that they don't have the competance to own a vintage
vw.

 Wait a minute ! ! I am getting peace signs from 10 - 12 year old kids on the
 street when I drive by with my yellow smiley faced front tire cover.  And
 from late teens as they drive past in their BMWs and Audis from the rear,
 after seeing my Jerry Garcia, crying bus, and dancing bears etchings on the
 rear window.


How is it that these [very] youngsters can relate:  VW bus + smiley face or
 JC montage = peace sign??  Was it 'That 70's Show??&quot;
