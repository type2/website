&gt;    Just have them sent COD.

Harmon's probably right, although I've never done the COD thing and have
bought and sold a fair amount of bus stuff through the list and never had a
problem.  I figure if someone rips a fellow listmember off that's bad
karma, and their engine is likely to seize somewhere between Eagle Plains
and Inuvik.  I know there have been some rip-offs from the list reported
before, so maybe that stretch of road will be good pickin's for parts buses
sometime...

Seriously though, if you opt to go non-COD, I'd suggest sending money via
money order.  MOs are particulary good for cross-border stuff since you can
get it made out in (name of country) currency even if you don't have a
(name of country's currency) account.

As for formal vendors, check out other listees reviews of them on the site.
My dealings with the mainstay vendors have always been very positive, and I
encourage other listmembers to patronize their businesses.

(Well, there was the one unnamed fellow who sold me a propex heater he had
that was gathering dust in his garage, then freaked out at me because he
couldn't understand why my money order to him was three weeks delayed after
my sister in law got in an accident, and was in ICU with a serious
brain-injury for 4 weeks...  )
