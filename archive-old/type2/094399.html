Subject: peparts_dot_com and seat belts

Does anyone know anything about www.peparts_dot_com? I noticed they share the
same mailing address as GoWesty_dot_com.

I found them in a print ad and they their website says they have a 3-point
retractable seat-belt for 68-79 busses. The print ad mentiones genuine Repa
parts so I'm interested in anyone has bought this and installed it.
