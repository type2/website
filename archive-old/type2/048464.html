Subject: [T2] Long Island  listees

Hi Folks,
   Sorry I missed friday with this, but saturday is close, right?
Anyway, if any listees live on Long Island, and would like to be part of a 
local bus group please get in touch with me.  There are a few of us who are 
thinking of starting some kind of Long Island VW bus group.
