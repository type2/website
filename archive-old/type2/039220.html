Subject: fuel filler

     The archive is down so here goes.  I have my 79 2.0L engine out doing
the heads &amp; such.  While it is out, I am considering taking the gas tank out
now to check it.  I found my fuel filler hose is screwed.  I know new ones
are unavailable.  What are my options?  Are there any other suitable
replacements?  Thanks.
