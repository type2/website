Subject: Type 4 Bruck Oil Cooler

I ordered a &quot;Bruck Germany&quot; oil cooler from CIP1_dot_com.

It came in a box too small for it (actually two boxes tapped together) and instead of 021-117-021B as the part number listed it said 113-117-021. Obviously they used the beetle oil cooler boxes but this cooler is the correct size for the Type 4 engine.

The cooler looks like it's been in storage a long time because the ports for the oil cooler seals are crusty. There are no markings on it and the holes for mounting on the studs were a tight fit. The cooler is also slightly different at the end where the securing bracket mounts. The bracket won't fit without a little trimming of the cooler (won't affect it's cooling ability or structure IMHO) but I have to wonder what non-German bus or ever other Audi/VW model this unti was really intended for. For some reason it has the same kind of foam seal the beetle coolers come with.

I'm still skeptical of the Germany markings: the box says Hecho en Alemania but I'm skeptical. I'll have to see how well it holds oil after I mount it to this 72 engine.
