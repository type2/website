Subject: Lake Tahoe adjustments? 

Just took my bus up skiing to Tahoe this weekend, and had what I guess
is my first encounter with altitude in a bus.  Forgive the imminent
rambling, I'm trying to sort it all out in my head.

	Bus ran like Krap in Tahoe (low power, low idle, crummy starts) but
seems to be running fine now that I'm back in SF.  Couldn't figure out
why until I saw my tailpipe at the Tahoe gas station: a brand new layer
of black-as-coal deposit.  I'm beginning to think this was the
altitude... so here's my reasoning:

	High altitude=less oxygen = engine runs comparatively rich = crummy
performance. 
	
	I've also been dealing with an annoying run-on problem for the past 3-4
weeks: engine seems to sputter *backwards* for a couple of revolutions
after I turn off the ignition.    Now I think it's all beginning to fit
together:

	initial run-on was caused by an overly rich mixture here at sea level,
which altitude compounded when I got to Tahoe and made performance even
worse than it would have been (mixture way, way too rich)

	Am I right in this reasoning?  If so, I need to readjust my carbs here
(lean them out a bit) but I also need to know how to adjust carbs for
subsequent runs up to Tahoe.  Did an archive check and it turns out jets
are the thing to change... could I get away with fiddling with the
volume screw instead?  I don't really feel like changing the jets for
each ski trip...

	BTW, this was also my first winter trip with a functional BN4 heater...
WOW!!! Heat in a VW is an amazing thing.  You should have seen the
disbelieving stares from people as we sat cozily in the van, no gloves
or hat, just light sweaters, looking out of a frost-free windshield...
hehehehe.  BN4's rock.
