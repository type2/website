&gt; what would be the best way to clean the padded *material* part of the
&gt; dashboard?
&gt;
&gt; the bus *71* was in one of those *shifting sands of New Mexico* paint shops
&gt; recently and we got the 10 foot special, spray job.  The windshield was
&gt; removed to do some front skin welding under it,  and when they did the
&gt; priming &amp; painting they didn't bother to cover the dash.  I have tried
&gt; simple green, but it still has this grayish white film over it when it's
&gt; dry.
&gt;
&gt; would acetone on a terrycloth towel work?  Don't want to use the wrong
&gt; stuff,  and destroy the padding.
&gt; It's actually in good condition with no cracks or damage, except for the
&gt; over spray.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
