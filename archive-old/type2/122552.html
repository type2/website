&gt; So fuel pressure is *not* constant.  So, with hi vacuum(not much

I said in my post that the pressure differential at the tip of the injector
is constant. For all purposes because that is fixed.

&gt; Connector to the coil from ecu tells *when* to inject.
&gt; AFM tells *duration* of injector opening(or how much fuel).

If you want to look at it like a math equation it's:

(rpm + afm) * (engine temp + air temp + lambda)

where lambda is optional.
 
&gt; The AFM line above is why a lot of us want to go to megasquirt...
&gt; #1, it is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a restriction in the air intake and #2,
&gt; I've &quot;heard&quot; that at about 4,000 rpm, the vane is on the max limit....so
&gt; you really don't get a longer duration of squirt, but you do get more of
&gt; them because the ecu is also watching the rpm's as well.

Aren't there theoretical limits to engine power anyway? What kind of
improvement are you expecting?
