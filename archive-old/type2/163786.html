Subject: Re: [T2] safety net for my daugter to sleep upstair wanted

Alot of newer SUVs have safety nets in them. Many Ford vehicles had them in  
the trunks of their midsize cars as far back as 93. Some have heavy duty  
latches on the ends. Just a thought I have seen many at the car lot I use to  work 
at. They aren't huge but, with minor modifications or a creative mind it  
would work. Maybe craft 2 together to be wider. The strength is  plenty.  
Hopefully half way helpful info.
