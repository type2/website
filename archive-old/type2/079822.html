Subject: Re: [T2] Very Intermittent Loss of Power

I had similar intermittant symptoms recently, dying, went to side, would
start...but it was a poor connection to the fuel pump!  Vehicle
vibration made it _at_^#%$% intermittant.

  I also had rust silt blockage a while back - terrible going up hills)
-and replacing the filter on the road helped that.  Lots of rust silt
came out the hose before the filter.  Later I blew air up the line (tank
just emptied) and heard a clunking in the tank, which must have been the
outlet screen popping off!  I flushed the line (added gas, let it run
out) and have bought some time.....and keep my air pump and spare filter
with me!
