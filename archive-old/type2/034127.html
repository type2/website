Subject: Fuel lines, Paint and heat exchangers. POR-15, etc, for 40 square feet or so.

	Went to fill up the truck yesterday and checked the engine compartment
just like I should... gas leak, the hose I did in a loop from the
steel fuel line to the intake of the fuel pump. Fabric outside of
hose was soaked and it was dripping gently on the tin. Drove home
and replaced it IMMEDIATELY with new piece of hose. I replaced all
my hoses less than 3 years ago. Check your bus regularly!
	Time to go buy more hose and repeat the &amp;#_at_)$*# process.

	So, since a fully &quot;Hoverized&quot; case gets painted black, to reject
heat and stay cool, shouldn't those in search of heat from the stock 
set-up take their heat exchangers off, clean 'em up and paint them WHITE? 

	Since Color-Rite in Campbell is gone, I don't know where to look
for POR-15 or similar products in sizes big enough to brush-paint the
rusty bed of our truck, so I can put primer and couple color coats over
and not have it get worse while we save for a real paint job.
	Any recomended sources for POR-15 or similar products in pint-2-pint-
gallon sizes in the South- or East-Bay Area?  I wouldn't mind a p-mail
on this, I don't get a chance to read all the digests. That work thing ;(

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
