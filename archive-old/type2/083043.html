Subject: Contacting Miller FI

Hi,

I looked up the website of Miller Fuel Injection &amp; was very impressed with their products &amp; interested as to how well they'd suit my applications.

But when I tried to contact Gary Miller his email address on the site kept rebounding on Mailer Daemon &amp; I haven't been able to get through.

Does any know of another address other than gmiller_at_pacifier_dot_com for Miller FI?

I wanted to ask Gary some stuff about his products.

Cheers
