When I was a kid one old formula for water proofing was to dissolve paraffin
in boiling white gasoline. It did warn you not to boil the gasoline over an
open flame. I did work. White gas didn't leave a smell like kerosene does.

In the 50's safety was an individual thing it was not societies job to
protect us.
The druggist wouldn't sell us the makings for explosives without our parents
consent. Our explosives lab was in the highway patrolman's house. We would
all go to jail for it today.

As to Thomson's water seal there are some more durable products out there
that are better on wood. I don't know how they would be on canvas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just thought I would add my $.02 worth before this thread gets killed.
&gt;The
&gt;&gt;&gt;parrafin/kerosene approach to waterproofing may well indeed work, but
this
&gt;&gt;&gt;will make your tent very flammable.  You would basically be making your
&gt;&gt;&gt;tent nto a giant candle.
