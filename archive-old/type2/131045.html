Subject: T2 chicks and remover stuff

&gt; &gt;On a whim we asked these girls to model for us.  Chicks dig vans.
&gt; &gt;http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/sitings/

&gt; OK, I gotta know:  How did you get two lovely young ladies in scanty
outfits
&gt; pose next to your bus!?

Umm I thought everyone has this happen to them on a regular basis.  The
chicks
do love my sexy magnets. Seriously, it's like pantyremover... oops can I say
that?

Anyway we just finished a pitcher of beer and were driving and I said to my
buddy
'watch me make an idiot of myself'

Two hot chicks, asked if they would mind posing with the bus and
groovysigns.
Told them I have a hobby/business with them and they said sure!

I have their email address to do more photoshoots with different cars.
I sent them the link as well and offered to print off whatever they wanted
on good
photopaper too.

The other weekend I had on my sign:
'A$$ grass or cash no one rides for free'

And this hot chick looks, smiles and says.. 'wanna take me for a ride?'
I have a girlfriend so I said maybe later (with a big big smile).
