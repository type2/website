Subject: Gas Stove on 79 ASI
Date: Fri, 17 Nov 2000 11:10:20 -0800
	charset=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;


Hi all,

I am currently restoring my ASI, and I was wondering if anyone could point
me to some documents/resources as to how I can go about overhauling my
propane stove/tank/fittings/etc.. without blowing my hand off.

Any help or recommendations would be great.

Thanks.
