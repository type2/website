Subject: Re: [T2] Stewart Warner Gas Heater vs. Eberspacher

Bob said:

if you can find a junkyard/pick n pull 411/412 you can find all the pieces
but they are well hidden...lets see you need:
 
 the heater itself,
heater should also have glow/spark plug, burner fan, exhaust pipe,
ignition coil, thermo switch..
seperately there is
temp regulating switch
fuel pump
main switch
temp sensor
dual relay
safety switch
heater air blower
overheat switch

think that is all.  fuel pump, plug and burner fan are not easy to funge
around others can be worked around but not easy.
