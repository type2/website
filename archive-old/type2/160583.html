Subject: Re: lock cylinder removal

I finally got a replacement lock cylinder for my front door handle, and
the thing won't come out of the handle.  The other two I've removed came
out easily once the screw and spring were moved.  This one is locked and
I don't have the key.  Will they not release when they're locked?

dan, i have only removed about 10 cylinders and about 1/3 were jammed  
from dirt and corrosion. the o-rings on the key side dries out and  
lets the crud/moisture in. i have had success putting the philips  
screw back in [spring removed of course] and banging the screw into a  
hard metal object. in a junkyard, that is not too hard to find. the  
screw absorbs the shock so the cylinder is free from defect. just  
wack it correctly. spray some liquid wrench if you have it on hand.  
works for me.  - steve
