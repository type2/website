Subject: Re: [T2] Freeze 12 experience

Hi David,

Did you have a chance to check out your Freeze 12 on a
real hot day?  I hope it's still working for you.  I
can't seem to keep some of the blends I tried in my
old cars cooling for more than a couple weeks.

By the way, Freezone has a nice web site with info on
many types of refrigerant &lt;www.freezonerb276_dot_com&gt;.  It
turns out that Freezone is almost exactly the same as
Freeze 12.  They both have about 20% HCFC 142b and 80%
R134a.  I've heard that both work well, but wanted to
hear how your Mustang is cooling these days.  I'll
have to order through the mail, and although Freezone
costs more at $10/can, I think you can buy just a few
cans to try it.

Rob

&gt; Volks,

&gt; I wanted to share my experience with Freeze 12
&gt; refrigerant as a replacement

&gt; I then started the car and put in two cans of Freeze
&gt; 12.  Yup, no flush or
&gt; oil change required - works fine with mineral oil. 
&gt; car for a ride, it was 80 degrees out, dark and
&gt; humid.  Nearly froze my
&gt; face but I wanted to reserve judgement until a 90
&gt; degree day with the sun

&gt; OBC:  If Freeze 12 works as well as I think it does,
&gt; I am going to strongly
&gt; consider dumping the 134a from the A/C in the bus
&gt; and replacing it with
&gt; Freeze 12.  I have ester oil in the bus but Freeze
&gt; 12 is compatable with it
&gt; - in fact, they recommend it if you need to add oil
&gt; to the system.
&gt;
