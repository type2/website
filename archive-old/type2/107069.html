Subject: Westrailer II

Hi Volks,

Last spring I built the Westrailer, a box trailer with type2 
tail-lights and a fibreglass westy pop-top. This allowed me to get a 
lot of gear out of the bus when traveling with the family, which 
greatly simplifies the bus's transition from road warrior to campsite 
activity center.

This weekend I completed the new 2003 Westrailer. It features a quick 
set-up roadside or campsite kitchen that is more suitable for touring 
with a family of five than what is found in a standard westy. Over the 
winter I changed the hinge from the front to the driver's side, and 
integrated a 5-gallon water tank, cooler and stove storage and a 
10-square foot countertop. The trailer still has over 40 cubic feet of 
secure storage. And it tows quite easily, too, as I proved pulling it 
1800 miles to and from Everybus a few weeks ago.

Check out the new pics, they're online at:

Happy trails,
