Subject: Re: [T2] MPG Westys


I get 18-19 mpg. Mostly highway driving _at_ 70 -75 mph. Bus is '78 Westy with
all the camper stuff. Engine 2.0 oval port heads, FI, all stock with the
exception of a webcam grind number 74 I think. Also all moving parts in
engine were balanced many dynamicaly the rest static. I have about 2500
miles on this motor and love it. I have yet to give it a real good tuning.
I'm guessing dwell is probably a little off, timing and idle set at 100
miles. I was hoping to get your mileage. I would like to know how fast are
you driving to get this mpg? My mileage improves when I keep it under 65
but who likes to go that slow...  Also do you have electronic ignition? I
have heard that can help mileage a little.

Was written************************************
Several people aked about the mileage I am getting
with the ICT's I just installed.I saw a 4 mpg
improvement on average over theProgressive Weber.
I was getting about 11 mpg in town, went up to 15
immediately.I got 18.5 on the road this weekend, never
saw betterthan 15 before.
************************************************

Lat week we took our 79 Westy fully loaded with three
people and two dogs with camping gear for five days
and a car top carrier/box mounted on the pop top and I
averaged 22.4 MPG. Stock 2L hydro lifters and fuel
injection.
What are other late westy's getting on mpg ?
