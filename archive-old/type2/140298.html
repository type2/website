Subject: Switches

Just returned from Mexico (again) and I have about 20 push button
switches that will fit the light fixture (the one over the fold up table) in
the camper vans.  Not an exact duplicate, but pretty close.  They cost
me 85 cents apiece.  Just got them for people on the list here so if anyone
needs them, how about $3 for 2 switches and the cost of mailing them.
If anyone is interested P-mail me.
BTW is there an equivilant Type1 list?  I am thinking about finding a
65 - 67 beetle to keep me off the streets and out of the bars.
