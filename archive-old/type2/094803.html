Subject: Re: [T2] the Little Brakes that wouldn't (the punch line) 


I guess that's where I left off
six years ago

Why did you stop?

Isn't it amazing how the brain fades with years of drug
abuse and abnormal sexual practices?

Umm... I don't remember.

Now, with functioning brakes --&gt; today my bus moved,
under it's own power, for the first time, since I bought it ten
years ago!  HOO-fuckin'-ray!!

Amen.

When I figure out where
I stashed the seat belts, ten years ago, I can venture out
onto the road.

Just change the fluids.
