Heh heh. 

Good write up.

I don't at the moment but I can relate WHY it's a good
thing;

- There is something about having all that cubic area
traveling down the road with you.

- There is also something about the seating position,
esp. re: the steering wheel. I think a lot of SUV
drivers like this similar thing, the visibility and
everything.

- There is a certain utilitarian aspect to it: hauling
stuff or hauling people, it's very useful.

- There are other, cool, like minded people who you
can hang out with. Even some cool, not-like minded
people you find you can hang out with.

- With proper care and maintenance they are both semi
indestructible AND worth saving.

- There's this karma thing, I'm trying not too hard to
puzzle out all the details on this one, just let it
flow as it sees fit.

- It's a house, it's a truck, it's a den, it's a
conveyance through the space/time continuum- It's a
Party on Wheels!
