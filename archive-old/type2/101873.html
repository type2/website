Hi Eric,

Indeed, welcome to the list!

On your second trip to the FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Supplier) 
you may want to check out some tires. If your bus isn't already running 
with Load C or D rated 185/14's with dual-ply sidewalls you will 
sincerely appreciate this upgrade, it makes a huge improvement in 
handling. Ray Nemo wrote a great tire FAQ following a long thread here 
on tires, it's available at: 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/nemobuscaptain/tires.html

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;&gt; Im new to your mailing list and a new VW owner.
&gt;&gt; I just bought a 77 Westy this week. Since this is my first VW, Im 
&gt;&gt; sure I
&gt;&gt; will be asking a lot of questions.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having a great forum strictly for type II owners.
&gt;
&gt; Hey on your first shopping list put fire extinguisher, new flexible 
&gt; brake lines, and replace the WHOLE fuel system (all the rubber vent 
&gt; lines, rubber fuel lines, etc.). Better to have a bus that will not 
&gt; catch fire and one that will stop if it does. (I'M SERIOUS).
