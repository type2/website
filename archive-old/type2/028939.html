There are connecting rods that attaches the motor arm to the wiper arms
these silver metal rods just snap into the pivot. When the motor is of via
the ignition switch for know look up under the dash and see if one looks to
be hanging. You can pull the glove box off pretty quick to see the wiper
rack a little better. If this is not the problem then the nut on the motor
arm came off.

Ok switch. Either you have a faulty switch, na I think that if you reach up
under the dash and grab the back of the switch you will feel that it is
loose. You will need to unscrew the knob and get a pair of snap ring pliers
to tighten the flat washer looking nut with two grooves in it.

I hope this helps. You can find a good illustration of all these parts on
our website www.bustedvw_dot_com under electrical equipment then windshield
wipers. Good luck

okay...i go to take the bus for state inspection.  i last drove it on
tuesday.  since then it has been moved once by a third party (the owner's
of the house that the bus is staying at.)

anyway, i get in and start him up.  i notice that the windshield wipers are
half way up the windshield.  i tested the wipers on my way to my alignment
appointment on tuesday and they worked fine.  i did not however use them
when i got back....so, i am not the one that turned on the wipers last.

so, i go to use the wipers to put them back in their resting position.  no
dice.  the motor is working, but the wipers are not moving.  the first
switch on the wipers is a good pace (from the motor sound) and the second
switch is much faster.  well, the motors sounds somewhat okay.

now, i go to put the wiper switch all the way down to turn of the
motor....once again, no dice.  the motor is still running!  i can carefully
position the wiper switch to stay between what should be off (now slow
running speed) and the first speed position.

so, i didn't bother taking it for the inspection.

unfortunately, i cannot ask the individual that moved the bus...what he
did, because he left for a funeral out of town yesterday and won't be back
for awhile.

help!  i need to get this sucker inspected and the wipers obviously need to
work for this to happen.  any input would be much appreciated!  i'm
beginning to lose my patience.

thanks in advance.
