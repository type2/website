Subject: BN4

hi  all - i pulled a BN4 gas heater and ducts from a junkyard a few weeks
ago. it came off a 72 bus. i noticed it did not have a switch, but was
connected to a heater cable at the instrument panel - the stock
heater/defrost on off. how can this be? if a switch, part# 411 963 107 C
were to be available, would it be more preferable than setting it up the
way i found it? confused, i've never even thought about one of these units
before... and am still not sure what i'm looking at. THANKS!  - steve
