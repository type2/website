Subject: Re: Dizzyness: Canister on wrong side 

Is this a rebuilt engine? It sounds like the dist. dive shaft in the case is 
in backwards. This is the what happened with the engine in my Beetle, the 
guy I bought the car from had put the shaft in 180 deg. out and since it has 
an 009 in it there was no vac. canister to clue me in. I figured it out the 
first time I did a valve adjustment and nothing lined up right. With an 009 
you can just stick it in backwards so the static timing mark for #1tdc 
cylinder lines up, with a vacuum advance that mark would be for #3tdc. 
Swapping the spark plug wires should work.
