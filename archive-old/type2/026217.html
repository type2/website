	the highest compresion &quot;Stock&quot; in a VW ac engine was the 1500S
engine.
	never offically exported to the USA, less than 10,000 ever
built...12.8-1
	was the claimed Compression Ratio.

Where'd you get those figures?  The 1500 S engine was used with all dual
carb Type 3s in '64 &amp; '65.  The compression ratio was 8.5:1 and put out 54
b.p.h. (DIN) / 66 b.p.h. (SAE).  During this time the 7.8:1 single carb
version was still being produced.  Almost all of the 14,240 Type 3 Ghias
produced during those years were of the 1500 S variety.  A few single carb
T34s were undoubtedly produced for countries without access to higher octane
gas but no sales brochures mention this version.  Pinning a total production
on the rest of the Type 3 line would be harder because both models were
offered but 10,000 engines for the whole Type 3 line is certainly a very low
number.  For the '66 model year, VW found they could keep the horsepower
virtually the same by bumping the P/Cs up to 85s (1600cc) and lowering the
compression.
