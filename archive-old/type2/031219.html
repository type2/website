&gt; &lt;&lt;OK, now I have a dumb question.... I am still new to this great
&gt; adventure of Bus ownership. I just assumed my windshield washer pump was
&gt; bad, but hadn't checked yet. I noticed a funny little hose with what
&gt; appeared to be an air valve on it. Does the washer reservoir actually
&gt; use air pressure?!&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;yep, however I can't remember the last time I've seen one of em work,
&gt; I have a new bottle since mine leaks like a sieve, if this doesn't work
&gt; 
&gt;      One thing I have not seen yet is you pump it up to 42 PSI. And mine


at a LOT less than 42psi I have a front seat sprinkler system!!!!
