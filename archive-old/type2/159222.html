Subject: Re: [T2] VW powered air compressor

Mark-
Diagnosis confirmed.
Since I use mine for sandblasting as well,
my complaint is that oil mist contaminates
the surface for following paint application.
And the hose gets so damn hot you can't hold
it without gloves.
I haven't put a filter trap in the output yet,
which should resolve the issue of oil mist.
It would have to match the huge delivery rate.

Dave

     Mark-
     When I built this compressor, I noticed the oil mist,
     so I broke it down and swapped pc from engine to pump.
     The engine pc rings were seated, good compression and
     no visible emissions. Same result, oil through the pump.
     That was over three years ago, I use it a lot.
     This leads me to believe their hypothesis, and I don't see
     a fix for that. Do you have this problem?
     Dave

hey Dave  yes mine kinda does the same.  I found that it would gum up a
Da sander ,so I only use it for sandblasting and blowing stuff.  I
wouldn't use it for painting at all  later  mark D
