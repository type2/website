&gt; ah ha,, check all your heavy ground wires from the frame to the tranny...

Ya know, I've never been able to figure out where those ground straps
actually are, or at least I've never been able to spot them while under the
bus.

And my starter finally quit weeks ago (lots of gentle inclines for starting
down here, if you're careful where you park), and still trying to fit a
rebuilt into the budget.

I'd look in my Haynes (haven't been able to get the other books, yet), but
can't figure out where I left it last.

Anyone out there have a pic of an actual trannie w/straps installed?
