Subject: RE:rear shock bolt size

Top is 100mm; bottom is 85mm.

This brings up another question (I just meant to post this ...): does the
lower just pass through ist hole in the bearing carrier assembly or is this
part threaded? Reason for my question is that I have a very hard time
removing this bolt. The nut is off and the bolt spins - but only using a
breaker bar and lots of force.

does anyone know the length of the top and bottom 12M bolts that hold 
the rear shocks on my 78 westy?
