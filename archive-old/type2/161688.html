Subject: best SIZE 15&quot; tire for a 1971 Westfalia

I have purchased 15&quot; rims for my 71 Westy, and am ready to upgrade the 
tires/suspension. I have read great information from RATWELL and others 
about 15&quot; tire sizes, but noticing much is for VANAGONS.... and I have a 
BAY.

So.... what is the best size for clearance and not rubbing during braking 
(when the axle shifts/bends to the rear of the front wheel well ? 205's or 
215's ??? (read below)

Please do not comment on the rear, or the spacers, as I will deal with that 
after I establish the correct height for the front tires... again 205's or 
215's ???

ADDITIONALLY, I would really like to hear from bay owners running 15&quot; rims 
and tires.... please no, I've read, heard, or thought... REALLY need the 
actual owners.
