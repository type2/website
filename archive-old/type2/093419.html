&gt;Is there any way that you can remove the flexible shaft on a 71 bus
&gt;speedometer cable to grease it.  I looked in Bentley but could only find
&gt;instructions on how to remove and replace the complete unit.
========================&gt;
I have successfully used some spray lubricants on them.
It might take several applications for the stuff to &quot;walk&quot; it's way down 
the cable as the cable turns while in use.

Try alternating squirts of white lithium grease from a spray can and 
plastic tube, and Valvoline Synpower penetrating lubricant from the same 
type of squirt configuration.

WD-40 could be used as a &quot;starter&quot; fluid for the above lubricants, as it 
will sort of start the carrier action of these better lubricants. WD-40, by 
itself, will not do too much, nor will it last too long within the cable 
assembly.
