Subject: Re: [T2] 79 California FI is idling right!

It will surge 1,2,3 times and then run fine for 2 miles, give a surge.
Run fine for a few more 
&gt; miles. 

Believe it or not! Little tiny cracks in your fuel lines or hard seals
under your injectors can cause the surge.
When you have good vacuum it sucks in air at these locations. Previous to
having good vacuum they operate fine.
