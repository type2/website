Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper 

 &gt;&gt;But
why not just tie or bracket the license plate so that it sits very low
when in storage (between the bottom of the cover and the ground), or
even tape or tie it to the outside of the cover?&lt;&lt;

maybe i'm being pessimistic here, but isn't that absolutely begging 
someone to steal your license plate?
