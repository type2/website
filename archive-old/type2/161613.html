Subject: Re: [T2] trading time?

They're in Long Beach, CA - close to CSULB. I'm not in a big hurry - but 
it's be nice to see them go to someone who will use 'em. I'll go get the 
serial #'s... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

O.k., here we go:
the only serial # I found was on the cabinet beneath the z-bed. Label reads:

Westfalia Werke-K-G
Campmobile 70, (serial # stamped): 9 04126

looks similar to this one, 
http://images.google_dot_com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/archives/manuals/stoermer/70westymanpage8.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/archives/manuals/manuals70westy.php&amp;h=881&amp;w=1275&amp;sz=140&amp;hl=en&amp;start=16&amp;tbnid=oYGb8NrwpehGaM:&amp;tbnh=104&amp;tbnw=150&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dwestfalia%2Bcampmobile%2B70%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26sa%3DG
but the clothes closet I have appears to be 1/2 as tall. The rubber/plastic 
trim is black, not white. Insides of the z-bed cabinet and behind the panel 
is a waffle-weave white vinyl.

Oh yeah, label on the panel says:
&quot;Fix table on top of the motor while driving&quot; in German, English, then 
Spanish??-can't remember. I'm all about multi-tasking, but how do ya pull 
that one off?

here's a link w/some pics to someone who sold a &quot;westfalia campmobile 70&quot;:
