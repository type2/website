Well, all the people who have been hooting and jumping on the furniture and
throwing food have agreed to settle down.

After many requests because of its many deficiencies, the info file has
been updated. I'll post it in a message to follow, called PLEASE SAVE THIS
MESSAGE. The info file contains subscribe/unsubscribe instructions that
many people seen not to have on hand, along with much interesting and
practical information. ;)

Newbies, please pay particular attention to things like &quot;cut quotes to the
bone.&quot;

Eddie still hasn't resubscribed, but at least he's home safe, so I wanted
to say, welcome back Inuvikers!

One last thing: At Gerry's request, and I have to concur because of concern
for the bleeding eyeballs of the double-listers, we are asking that you do
not cross-post Friday Funnies. Post them, groovy, but don't cross-post
them. Sorry.
