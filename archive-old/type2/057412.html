&gt; Not a joke at all -- look at any sandrail or dunebuggy...they
definitely don't have sealed engine compartments.

No they don't, which means that they are less likely to recirculate
warmed air.  Vehicles with full bodies tend to trap the warmed air and
recirculate it.

&gt; Also look at VW powered aircraft
&gt; no cooling tin at all, or even fans.

Well, there's that big one on the front!  Aircraft have very carefully
designed cowlings and baffling (internal ducting) to make sure that
air flows over the cylinders and is then exhausted far enough away
that it won't be recirculated.

&gt; I also ran a VW powered sawmill
&gt; for many years -- only minimal cooling tin.

Not having seen it, I can't comment except to say that applications
such as this don't usually demand full power from the engine, and thus
don't make huge demands on cooling.  The engine was probably fairly
open (no bodywork around it) as well.
