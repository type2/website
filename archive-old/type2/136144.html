&gt; Well, I've been putting it off for some time now, that little tiny leak

&gt; Glad this is a Type4 engine, being a '73 1700, so I can do it with the 
&gt; engine in.

yes, it's an easy job. remove the valve covers, then rocker arms. take
the push rods out. This will allow you to easily remove the push rod
tubes. What type of seals do you have to replace them with? The brown
viton seals are fantastic, and worked well on my bus. You shouldn't
have to put any sealent on it. I just used a bit of motor oil as a
lubricant to help get it to slide in.
