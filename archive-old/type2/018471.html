Subject: Low Idle Miss(tery)
Message-ID: &lt;3762B532.CBFD3704_at_west_dot_net&gt;

Recently purchased 74 1800, dual carbs: Cylinders #3 and #2 are not
firing at low idle. I can pull the spark plug wires, no difference, the
engine just gallumps along at about 500 rpm. I'm getting spark from the
distributor through the wires &amp; the plugs are a nice tan color. (For
what that's worth.)

I tried loosening the idle circuit solenoid as David Schwarze has
suggested elsewhere. This yeilds no change in engine behavior, although
disconecting the solenoid does--the engine drops rpm and runs
erratically.

Any ideas?

(I realize that I need to check timing &amp; probably replace cap &amp; rotor
because the contacts are pretty worn. Anything else?)
