&gt; My question is, if money were no object (and of course it is, but
&gt; just for the sake of knowledge!), what would you check or replace as long
&gt; as the engine was already out?  I'd hate to discover two months from now
&gt; I had to pull the thing again for some standard maintenance item I just
&gt; didn't know to worry about.

Assuming you have good compression, the engine runs well, etc., etc., etc.
(IOW, the only justification for dropping the engine is to replace the front
seal)...I would:

* Replace both crank seals, front as well as rear.
* Replace the pushrod tube seals. This goes for Type 1 engines as well--
maybe more so there; you can replace these seals on a Type 4 with the engine
in the vehicle, but on a Type 1 unless you've got collapsible pushrod tubes
the engine has to come out to replace the seals
* Replace the oil cooler seals
* Check and set crankshaft end play
* Clean and repaint the tin

Okay! Okay! Fantasy mode on...replace the crank with one of John Connolly's
78mm stroker cranks, replace the cam with a split-duration special (John has
those too), throw in a set of 105mm pistons on Chevy rods with titanium rod
bolts, powder-coat the fan shroud the same color as the exterior of the Bus,
change the clutch...
