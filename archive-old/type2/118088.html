&gt; I checked compression, as per Bentley, and it read around 150psi on all 
&gt; four cylinders.
&gt; Now, when I removed the spark plugs, the left side ones were OK but both 
&gt; right side ones were
&gt; oil fouled. (These were new plugs as of yesterday!) I replace the fouled 
&gt; plugs and fired up.
&gt; Well, the problem was still there. Hard time starting, uneven idling, no 
&gt; power and some backfiring...
&gt; According to the manuals I have (Bentley and Haynes) oil on the spark plugs 
&gt; is caused either by
&gt; worn valve guides or piston rings. Now, if the compression seems right, 
&gt; does that mean it's the valve guides?
&gt; 

Hi Yall,
Excuse me as I have just jumped in the middle of this thread.
If your compression is good then wouldn't the rings, valves and guides be 
good?
Did you check the plug wires for proper firing order or possible cross fire 
condition?
It was running OK before the tune-up?
Be sure to cover the basics before you remove the engine.
Sorry if I've covered old ground here but it should be checked twice and once 
more by a friend.
Rusty
