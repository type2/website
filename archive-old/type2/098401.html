&gt; I am wondering if anyone is brave enough to admit the minimum number of

&gt; You *have* to have that or the starter will flex in the housing.  With the
&gt; rear bearer bar, tho.... I am thinking that that may be the irreducable
&gt; minimum! (with at least one stud in the case as a locator pin)  Anyone
&gt; actually had occasion to run like that?

The limiting factor would be the fact that using the clutch pushes the
engine away from the transmission.  If you use only one bolt the entire
force applies a moment to the one bolted flange which would result very
quickly in a broken flange
