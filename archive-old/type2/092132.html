Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting poll

Well this has been interesting.  So far it seems that
Im the only one who had to rush and intersection in
second and then went straight to 4th.

Im a dangerous man with a manual. But here is what mine
says

1st 0-15 
2nd 10-32 
3rd 15-52 
4th 30 and up (I never let mine get over 70, on
canadian roads)
That is for recommended shifting.  

Then it says for better fuel economy
2nd 10 to 23 
3rd 15 to 35 
4th 30 to 50 

All in mile per hour!

Any other questions?
