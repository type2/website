Nope, never ever drove with them open.  I always make sure they are tight 
closed.

And it is only the window on the sliding door.  It must be that I slam the 
sliding door too hard.

In fact, I usually open a window or a front door (usually the passenger door 
if I am outside the vehicle, or a rear vent wing if I am inside the 
vehicle)to relieve the pressure from inside so I can shut the sliding door 
more easily.

And if I get a passenger coming in next to me, I generally crack open my 
window so that they can shut their door!!  (Or I open my door; I know 
exactly how hard to shut my driver's door.)

Another:  to raise my poptop, I absolutely MUST open a door.  It is usually 
the sliding door, since I would be in the back, anyway, trying to hump the 
top up!!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, how replace the pivots of the window panes in my jalousie window?  
&gt;(Man, can you feel my 'pane.'  My brother is a chiropractor.  His shingle 
&gt;says 'champagne' - {sham-pain , get it!!}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone who can speak from experience, please speak up!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Over the years, the pivot has worn a larger (w)hole, and it makes 
&gt;serious
&gt; &gt; noise whenever I go over even the the smallest bump.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
