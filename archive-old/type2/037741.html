Subject: Fuel pump

Took my '77 on an errand this morning, and when I went out for lunch a
number of hours later, my fuel pump was just busy working away delivering
fuel to engine, but my engine was nice and shut off.

Well I searched the archives for an answer to this one.  (thanks to a fellow
list member for pointing me that direction first).  The archives had lots of
discussion on the fuel pump not working and not pumping, but not where it
didn't shut off.

Anyone seen anything like this before?  Any idea of where to look for this
one?
