Welcome Greg,

For those who don't know, Greg is host to the type3 mailing list, a special
guest for the type2 list by my account.

After the list problems here clear up, please go ahead and re-post your
intro &quot;Gottabus&quot; -- I'd like to hear the story!

(I posted a big, long &quot;Gottabus&quot; post &amp; intro over the weekend, around the
time the server problems started.  Honestly don't think it made it.  Also,
I don't know if I used anything to get my message filtered out... I've seen
people write things like &quot;B*g&quot; here, and suspect that this is may be why.
I'd very much like a list of taboo phrases if this is the case!)
