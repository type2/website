Subject: Disc Brake Drag

I've checked the archives and found the question to have been ask before but
no real answers, other than one about the booster.  With new disc put on a Bay
front-end (79) how much drag should there be on the wheels?  I can turn them
by hand and no high spot felt, but they will not free spin.  I've checked and
verified the rod adjustment.  The caliber are real tight sliding over the
disc.
