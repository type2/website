Subject: Re: Fuel Filter Saga

Sorry this is so late, as I was backpacking all weekend.

Travis, I'll bet you a dollar I know exactly what is wrong with your
bus, as I had the same problem in my '79 Westy: clogged fuel tank.

Here's my story and how I fixed it (dredged and adapted from the
archives):

This past summer, while travelling in my 79 Westy through Washington, I 
experienced an intermittant loss of power.  Every time I'd
shift into a higher gear and start accelerating, the bus would
suddenly lose power.  Eventually, the problem became constant and I
couldn't get the bus over 50mph.  I suspected a fuel line problem, maybe
even gunk in the tank (the PO kept the bus sitting in a garage for years.)
 
By some luck, I found a VW shop called &quot;Denny's&quot; nearby and asked for
some help.  Denny had an extra fuel filter, but that didn't do the trick.
After a few other checks and some discussion, Denny came to the conclusion
that there was something in the tank clogging the fuel lines.  He
suggessted that the tank be removed and cleaned!
 
Denny was kind enough to let me use his driveway and I was able to do
the work myself (and I didn't even have to drop the engine.)  It took two
days to do the entire job (what a royal PITA), but here's what I found:

Once the tank was removed and allowed to dry, a big chunk of rubber
fell out.  It turns out that a piece of rubber eroded from the fuel filler 
neck, fell into the tank, and once in a while it would settle to the 
bottom and cover the holes leading to the fuel lines!  
 
This piece of rubber is the part of the filler neck that looks like a
bird beak (I'm assuming it prevents one from using the leaded gas
nozzles).  The weird thing is, it looks like some PO actually replaced 
this filler neck since it had the same &quot;bird beak&quot; which exactly matched
what i found in the tank. The part was badly eroded and looked like it was
about to fall into the tank as well!  Needless to say, I just cut the
damned beak off.

After I put the tank back, the problem disappeared.  I still keep the
chunk of rubber on the dash to illustrate my stories ;^)

My recommendation to you Travis: before you yank the tank, see if you can
find some sort of instrument to probe the inside (be sure to drain the
tank first.)  Ideally, you'd want one of those miniature cameras at the
end of a flexible tube, but I have no idea where to find one of these.  My
next idea is this: get a stiff piece of wire (coat hanger will do) and
probe the tank from underneath (where the fuel outlet and return are
located.)  My bet is that you eventually encounter some resistance when
you poke up and the wire hits the chunk of rubber (or other garbage that
settled to the bottom of the tank.)  If indeed you find something, you
will now have to find a way to remove it.  Keep me posted and I'll walk
you through tank removal without dropping the engine.  You may even be
able to invent some sort of tool to recover the debris.

Good luck!
