Subject: Push Rod Seals

I remember awhile back there was talk on push rod seals.  So a couple of 
weeks ago I pulled off those 2 tins under the heads.  cleaned them, and put 
them back on.

1)      While the tins were off I noticed that the rods up above looked wet 
only on one side. Not completely dripping, but wet looking.  Again only on 
the passenger side of the car.  Is this anything to worry about or normal??

Then we went out to the desert this weekend and pulled over after driving a 
few hours and noticed my normal oil leak and another up by the push rods.  
It looked like it was leaking off a corner of the passenger side pan.  The 
ones I had just cleaned off.

2)        Does this mean my push rod seals are leaking?

3)        If so, how much will it run me? I figure mine as well do all of 
them

I have a 1600 dualport with about 40,000 miles on it.

How come nothing is in the idiots guide on push rod seals???
