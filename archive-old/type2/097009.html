Subject: RE: [T2] thermostat ?

My take: on an old bus, there's absolutely no guarantee at all that the
flaps are spring-loaded to stay open, unless you've personally verified
that it's still so.  When I purchased my bus, the little hole in the fan
shroud tin that once anchored the thermostat return spring was worn
through completely, so the spring wasn't doing anything at all.  After I
replaced the worn flaps and reattached the spring, I tested the flap
mechanism through its normal range of movement.  And guess what?  As
soon as it was stretched out (flaps closed), the spring broke.  My
lesson learned: any original parts are 20-30 years old, and there's no
good reason for me to assume that they're working unless I've checked.
