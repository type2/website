Subject: anyone know the exhaust temps at the headers?

Does anyone know the exhaust temps at the headers, just before it joins 
up with the &quot;U&quot; joint?  I have a narrowband o2 sensor mounted there 
which works great, but I'm going to be purchasing a wideband o2 sensor 
and it can only tolerate 900 degrees F max.

Here's a picture to give you an idea of the location that I'm talking about:

If you look towards the bottom right, you'll see a rectangular piece of 
metal sticking out from the exhaust joint (my o2 rock-guard).  That is 
where I mounted the sensor.  I'm wondering if that location will be too 
hot for the wideband sensor.

This is a 78 2.0 btw.

Thanks!
Mike
