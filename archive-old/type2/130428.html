Subject: Re: [T2] Bolts needed to attach pressure plate to 215mm 
  flywheel

Thanks Karl,

You are an asset to this list unsurpassed  in the ability to supply 
accurate info so quickly.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I promise never to EVER ask you 
about westy cot poles.

Tonight I will be able to re-install the engine. My vacation plans 
remain unaffected, except that now I will no longer have to worry about 
the clutch from here to Dixie Bus Gathering (Mt Vernon OH) and back. A 
win-win situation!

Happy trails,

&gt; 210 and 228 are 8mm.

&gt; The correct 215 bolts are triple-square. They are 7 x 1.0 x 20mm
