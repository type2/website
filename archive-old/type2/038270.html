Subject: Gas Tank cleaning

From: Chris Collier:

&gt;Just pulled my tank out of '78 and after pouring out about a pound of
rust (and a gas pump nozzle) I was wondering the best procedure for
cleaning.

Chris, if nothing is in archives, let me know. I have KG Bentley that covers 
only 3 years of T1's..so it covers lots of extra stuff... and it has an 
excellent write up on tank cleaning/preserving. If nothing else is 
available, I could post it.
