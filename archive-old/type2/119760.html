&gt;  Fortunately  I ordered a complete set of CV Bolts (24) a month ago from Bus
&gt; Depot to replace some that were stripping.  These however did not come with

&gt; purpose?  If so what should I look for.

The serrated washers are special and can be obtained from Volkswagen and
should be as the instructions say not to reuse them.  I do not know if the
double plate can be obtained from Volkswagen but would bet it is
available.  Most CV boot kits contain both bolts and serrated washers.
I cannot remember off-hand if any contain the double plate. I vaguely
remember at least one that did but would not bet on it.

                             OOK!
