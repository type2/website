&gt; I want to add an additional

&gt; experience with this sort of
&gt; heater? Is it reliable and safe?  Easy or hard
&gt; to install&lt;&lt;

Unless you have a water cooled Vanagon, this heater will be worthless to you
because the ad says that it uses the water that cools the engine for the heat,
and in an Air-Cooled bus, well, you get the picture....
