&gt; I have seen a lot of people talking about torsion bars lately and the
&gt; group thought on it seems to be that hi mileage vehicles(bugs and busses)
&gt; probably just need both sides replaced.
&gt;
&gt; The reasoning is that the metal is fatiguing after 30-50 years and
&gt; adjustment may help for awhile, but apparently the bug folks are starting
&gt; to break theirs after adjustment.

I've seen bars broken after being adjusted too high (for more clearance)
on Baja Bugs, but have never seen one on a bus.  My bus has been driving
around for 8 years on readjusted bars and is still at stock ride height.

Has anyone on the list broken their bars after adjustment?

For metal in continuous flexing like torsion bars, the fatigue life is
usually designed to be infinite.
