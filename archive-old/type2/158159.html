Subject: Re: [T2] compressed air zero-emission motor bus

&gt; Now here's a good idea: to convert VW buses to air-powered motors! The
&gt; ultimate fresh-air vehicle, even producing cold, clean air as an
&gt; emission! And 2000 KM per fill up on test models.

&gt; 
&gt; There's no free lunch...The emissions on a compressed air
car are only moved upstream. I'd be really doubtful about
that 2000 km number, too...
UPS has a hybrid system that uses hydraulic fluid...Two
tanks and a Maxwell's Demon Valve between them...Lift
off the gas and the vehicles motion pumps the fluid into
one tank...Step on the gas and the Demon Valve helps turn
the wheels...
