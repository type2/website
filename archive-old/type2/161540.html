Subject: Westy florescent interior light

Hey all,

I just picked up a really sweet '76 Westy and with a little work I've got the
fridge and sink pump working again, but the florescent light above the sink
does not have any power. The fuses in the fuse box are good and so are the
in-line fuses I've located. The light comes on when I put some juice to the
light assembly with a battery so I know that works. Is there another in-line
fuse somewhere I'm missing? Has anyone re-wired one these successfully?

Also the PO installed new pop top canvas a year ago (I told you it was sweet).
I would like to put a hard nylon edge of some sort on the joint of the frame
where it rubs against the canvas. Anyone ever seen anything like that? If
nothing else I'll polish the edge up with some 1000 grit sandpaper so it's
smooth. I am also curious if I should treat the canvas with something to
protect it from UV rays? I would like to delay the canvas from getting as
brittle and torn as my old Bus' was as long as possible.

Thanks,
Doug
