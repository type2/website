Subject: DIY tent patterns?

Hey all!

Anyone ever sewed their own pop-top tent canopy?  Mine's looking pretty 
manky, as the DPO didn't replace the seals and a fold of it got all 
mouldy and tore, but I just don't have $300 (Canadian)...  Whereas I 
could get cotton duck for around $15/m, or sunbrella for twice that, 
and sewing shouldn't be that hard...  But anyone happen to have a 
pattern (this is a 1981 Vanagon; they probably all differ a bit)?  I 
took some measurements today, and most of the pieces don't look like 
they are quite square and right-angled.  I haven't found patterns 
anywhere on line.  I guess I could take the old one apart, but that 
would be burning a bit of a bridge, if for whatever reason sewing the 
new one doesn't work out right...

Thanks,

Anton.
