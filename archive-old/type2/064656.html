Subject: busses in Portland OR

There are 3 vans in today's Oregonian (Saturday, 9/28) that sound 
interesting.

1960 23-window bus, new engine, $3500. 591-8565.
1957 panel bus, runs, needs work $1800/ofr 655-6481.
1959 bus runs good, 36HP, easy restoration project $1700, 777-0183.

There's also a mess of other busses, post 69, including a few campers.

The area code is 503.

I called on the 60. It has a new 1641 dual port engine (less than a 
year, still under warranty), and is a daily driver. It has rust in the 
cargo floor and no middle seat. It has pinholes in the front floor 
panels. I passed.

I'm hoping for a call back on the others.
