Subject: Fuel Injection to Carb conversion?
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990513092502.007a4620_at_mail.ikansas_dot_com&gt;

I'm talking to a guy about a bus... sound familiar to anyone? It's a '76
Westy, and
I'm not exacly in a position to go look at it right now. The last time it
was overhauled (about 40K ago) the PO did something I'm unfamiliar with. He
removed the FI system and installed a carb (a -28 or -30, the current owner
can't remember which). I guess my question is -- is this a good thing? I
would think that doing this would be possible, but problematic. Could
anyone point me to information about this kind of conversion so that (if I
buy this bus--please God) I can maintain it properly...

Thanks!

&quot;Fraser, there's a guy on my corner who asks me every morning if I've
seen God; do you really think he expects me to point Him out?&quot;
&quot;Well you know, Ray, if you did, perhaps he'd stop asking.&quot;
