Subject: Re: [T2] raising (ground clearance) a 71 type II

Yes, (to quote your statement) You CAN raise the rear
end with destroying the CV joints! I raised mine
slightly more (I thought) than eliminating the sag.
The suspension TOPPED out over any little dip and the
new set of CV's was junk in about 6 months. There is
already waaaayyyy too much air under there - what do
you hope to accomplish? It seems to me you are taking
a number of negatives related to our vehicles and
expanding upon them! The bad aspects of T2 handling
will be increased tremendously with your plan. I
really would like to know what the goal is! -BaH

&gt; 
&gt; I already plan on 15&quot; x 5&quot; rims, with correctly
&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
&gt; and may have to purchase one of these in the future,
&gt; but I want to be sure 
&gt; that it can be performed, and I can elevate the rear
&gt; (with destroying the 
&gt; CV's) to match the front (new height).
