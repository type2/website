Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Engine Fan?

on 6/3/03 14:12, you related:

&gt; one that was slightly
&gt; better designed the allowed more air to flow? Any idea?

the stock fan is very well designed, there is no need to improve it, but you
are correct to be concerned if it is missing blades. it will move less air,
and also be out of balance.

you can replace it with the motor in place. used parts vendors sell them,
i've seen them on ebay often, chances are someone on this list can offer you
one.

it would be a good idea to have the new fan balanced before installing it.
