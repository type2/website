Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

Not to encourage forgery, but I know of someone who, in trying to bring =
a very rare car across the ocean not only replaced the vin plates but =
also cut the stamped chassis numbers out of a donor (lost title) car and =
then welded them into the desired vehicle before bringing it over.  He =
then replaced the european chassis # and vin plate in the donor car and =
got the donor retitled with the new #s.  Some states are easier than =
others for retitling and sure it took a bunch of time and effort, but =
he's got the car now.  Is it worth it for a Bus, I don't know, there's =
some pretty nice restored buses out there for a lot less $$$ but to each =
his/her own.
