Subject: Re: canvas pop-top replacement

&gt;From: Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_metrowerks_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I see there are several places that sell replacement canvas pop-top.  What's
&gt;the best material to look out for?  I image that cotton was what rotted in
&gt;the first place.

If you live in a warm climate, you might consider just replacing it with screen.  That's what I did with mine ('71); it cost about $20.  True, it's a drawback in cold or 
rainy weather, but I've camped in both since then and haven't really found it to be a problem.  I string a tarp over the poptop to give me &quot;eaves&quot; if the weather's 
wet-looking, and if it's really cold, I just don't pop the top.

In mild-to-warm weather it's awesome, though.  Plenty of circulation and great view of the stars at night.

YMMV,
Joe Clark
