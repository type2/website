Subject: gas tanks

Hey,

thanks to those who responded to my gas tank q's.

got it out finally, the feed tube to the engine compartment really hung up and I had to bend some of the sheet metal out of it's way.

q1: whats the insulation under the tank made of? any asbestos? I had to tear some away (wore my ventilator).

q2. my tank was very clean, bare metal all around, maybe a 1/2cup of orange laquer in the very bottom. I like the marine clean idea raised, as I try to shy away from home-chemical storage. is this stuff biodegradable?

q3. tank sealer?

q4. anyone remeber my rear seat/carpet questions?

thanks,

Billy
