Subject: June Bug Jamboree/Busses on '66' (Springfield, MO)

This is my last post about this -- really. (Could someone forward it to
the VintagVW list?)

----------------
June 3 (Saturday):  The Sixth Annual June Bug Jamboree in Springfield,
MO. Sponsored by the General Registry of Ozarks Volkswagen Enthusiasts
(GROOVE).  Over 30 show classes, swap meet, car corral,  food &amp; fun for
the whole family.  New location at Chesterfield Village in SW Springfield!
Contact Greg Crane at (417) 890-0275 or Mark Mihalik at (417) 753-2919 or
e-mail vwgc72_at_freewwweb_dot_com

June 2 - 4 (Friday - Sunday): Fifth Annual Busses on 66 All-VW Bus
camping event. Located at the KOA Kampground (1-800-562-1228) off Historic
Route 66 near Springfield, MO. Sponsored by SAMBA, GROOVE, NEATO and
LiMBO, these three days of VW Bus fun and fellowship are a must for anyone
attending the June Bug Jamboree. For more information call Lance Moeller
at (417) 889-8813 or Bob Hufford at (417) 833-2047 or e-mail

Chesterfield Village is located just NW of the intersection of James River
Freeway (south edge of Springfield) and Kansas Expressway (take Hwy. 65,
south from I-44 -- or north from Branson, MO -- to James River Freeway
(cloverleaf interchange), then west on James River to Kansas Expwy.,
north to Chesterfield Village which will pop up quickly on the left (looks
like old brick buildings).

Or, if coming in Hwy. 13 from areas north, just stay on it as it turns
into Kansas Expressway (as it crosses I-44) and follow it south all the
way across town to just before the James River Freeway and you'll see
Chesterfield Village on the right.

The KOA is easy to find if you plan to camp.  Take I-44 west past
Springfield to Exit 72 and follow the signs (south of the Interstate as
you bisect the golf course).

If you need to call me I'll be at the number above Friday evening (unless
I'm out doing last minute show running or at the KOA).  I'll be
e-mail-less as my home PC died last Sunday and I need to do a complete
reload (and haven't found the time).  I will be back into work briefly
this evening, so I can do an e-mail check then, but don't expect a quick
response.  You can try Shane Hood &lt;nixaguy_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt; or Lance Moeller
&lt;LNWN4VWS_at_aol_dot_com&gt;, but I can't guarantee timely resposes there either.

The Kampground number is 1-800-562-1228 if you want to ask them about
fees, reservations, etc.

There is no additional charge by SAMBA for Busses on '66'.

Drive carefully and we'll see you at the show!

&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; 
&gt; Since I didn't know until Thursday evening that I'd be able to go, I'm now
&gt; scramblin' to get my '55 Fatherland Tour '99 Deluxe Sunroof and myself
&gt; ready to go.  I fly a &quot;turnaround&quot; this morning to Columbus, Ohio and back
&gt; and will try to depart for Springfield this afternoon around 4pm.  Could
&gt; you e-mail to me any and all info on the show location, the campground info
&gt; and directions, and anything else I might need to find you guys and the
&gt; event!  Is there an event website?  Thanks a bunch!
