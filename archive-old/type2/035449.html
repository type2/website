Subject: RE: Snow/Ice Driving Impressions 

Hi All,

Well I don't see much Snow or Ice in Australia but you want to see what a
Bus can do, checkout my Baja Bus site at http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi There's
pics of real everyday Buses geting air on sand dunes and even one bus
pulling a bogged 4WD outta the sand with ease  My own Bus runs 29&quot;x9.5&quot;
tires on the rear and has NEVER got stuck in anything, the only problem I
have is in the mud and slosh where the rear grips so well it can push the
front through the mud but I don't get much grip for steering. I normally
find I chicken out before the Bus actually gets stuck.  I carry a Hi-lift
jack with me just incase but have only ever used it to replace a wheel
bearing after it collapsed in the bush.  Who needs 4wd (thinking of geting a
sticker for the bus but I'm sure the day I do is the day I get bogged and
need that tow)

Cheers
Steve

&gt;Hello All. I have just had the pleasure of taking my ' 78 Westy out for a 
&gt;little drive in the most horrendous driving conditions that central NC has 
&gt;seen in all of recorded history. All I can say is &quot;Wow!!!&quot;. This machine
goes 
&gt;through snow, ice, slush, curbs&lt;it was burried under 20 inches of snow&gt; 
&gt;etc...I even had the unique experience of pulling a big macho 4wd truck out

&gt;of the ditch. A very humbling thing for the driver of said vehicle, to be 
&gt;sure! I am frankly dumbstruck by the westy's  ability to navigate through 
&gt;what I thought were un-drivable conditions.
