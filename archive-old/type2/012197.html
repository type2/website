After looking at the website, http://www.7net7_dot_com/glasnet/sealers.htm, I
started wondering if some of these more pliable sealants can be used to get
a little extra life out of other rubber parts such as ball joint boots? The
reason I ask is that prior to her trip to the body shop in 94-95, I had new
ball joints installed on my 71. Since then it's been driven maybe a total
of 40 miles. Although the ball joints installed were zero miles, they
certainly weren't &quot;made yesterday&quot; parts. Problem is that the older rubber
is beginning to show signs of cracking around the grooves in the accordion
portion of the seals. Hasn't broken through yet though. I damn sure don't
want to dissassemble everything simply to install new boots. I was just
wondering if anyone has ever tried filling in the cracks with any of these
sealant compounds and what kind of results you got. If nothing else, I'll
probably try something to this effect prior to anything more drastic.
Thought I would ask first to see if anyone else has &quot;invented the wheel&quot;
before me so to speak to save on some of the trial and error involved.
Final question on sealing windshields after the fact. With the 3M
injectable sealant, does much ooze out onto the glass and if so, does it
clean off well so that it's not noticeable? Thanks for the bandwidth.
