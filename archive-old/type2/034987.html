Subject: test your injectors!

I had to bench-test eight old injectors (4 from the former bus engine and 4
from the '79 bug) before I found 4 good ones, i.e., injectors with a good
spray pattern and that wouldn't leak. After a year of head-scratching, the
bug now finally runs like a champ! I really recommend that you too
bench-test your 20+ year old injectors if you have an drivability problem.
You should certainly do so if you're rebuilding your engine.
