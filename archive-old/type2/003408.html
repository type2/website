Subject: safari window question
Message-ID: &lt;002f01bebce2$7911e800$2259fed0_at_default&gt;

Has anybody ever put safari windows (or 1 big one) on a Vanagon? I've been
thinking about that lately. Man would it be cool.... I need to take the
windshield out soon anyway to fix some rust on the metal at the bottom.
Would turning the stock windshield into safari be feasable? Maybe with 3 or
4 clamps at the bottom. I dont think I'd have it open at highway speeds,
just cruising around town ya know. Any ideas, suggestions?
