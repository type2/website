Subject: RE: [T2] Left rear shock....

Hi Troy,

I had a similar problem with my left-rear shock making a clunk noise.  It 
turns out that the shock was tight enough for the top bolt not to move, but 
loose enough to move around when jarred.  Anyway, I jacked up the rear wheel 
very slowly, and checked the alignment of the shock &amp; bolt -- there was a 
point at which the shock was uncompressed _and_ the torsion bar wasn't all 
the way down on its stop.  At that point, the bolt was loose enough to run 
farther in.  You may have to raise and lower the wheel/jack/Bus a few times 
to find the right spot, but I bet there's a spot where you can run the bolt 
in tighter than it currently is.

If not, your shock may be shot and may need replacement anyway.  If so, be 
sure to attach the top bolt first.  That way, your raise/lower process is a 
lot easier since there's a straight-thru bolt/nut on the bottom.

Good Luck!
