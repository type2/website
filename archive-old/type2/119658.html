Subject: Distributer, schematic request (long)

I had the same problem with a distributor shaft that had slop.  This meant
the points bounced unpredictably and I could not get a constant dwell and
timing.  The Pertronix kit obviated the problem as all it measures are
degree of rotation.  Very easy to put on, EXCEPT the magnetic collar which
requires much more force than you would expect putting it on.  I used the
butt of a hammer on mine and down it went on the shaft, but broke off the
top ring.  Made no difference in functionality.  Now I have dead on dwell
and timing and never have to replace or adjust points.  Not a pleasant or
easy thing give the Type II distributor placement.
