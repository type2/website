Subject: Turn signal/headlight dimmer sw

71 SC: 2 wires (brwn and a brown/white one) inside the turn signal assy, are
connected to nothing..and of course the dimmer sw..and prolly the brake lght
sw, according to the Bentley wiring diagram, are inoperative. I don't see an
obvious place, on the top bendable plate, to solder them back on to the
place they came off. Anyone have a disassembled sw handy..or know where a
pic is available to help me get this truck back up to 4.0? (All else of the
great ign sw repair is hunky-dory now..but if I want to continue
spotlighting deer...I'll need that hi-beam sw working :)

Thanks, Marv Krupp

PS As I recall, the wires are # 30 and # 5
