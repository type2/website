&gt; Hey now busmates,
&gt;(clip)
&gt; anyone shed some light on why there is such a difference.  The smaller set
&gt; defintely will fit on my bus but why is the body of the exchanger so much
&gt; smaller on this set?

I think they might be type 4 heat exchangers. They were physically
intechangeable with type 2's but had only two pipes inside the covers
instead of the cast aluminum radiator-like heat exchagers. I think  
type 4's all had the BA4 gas heaters and about 1/3 the cubic volume of a
bus, so they didn't need such a large heat exchanger.
