Subject: engine removal finished

Well this weekend I finally managed to pull the engine. What read like quite
a simple procedure in Muir actually turned into quite the ordeal.  Anyways
after dropping the engine and then figuring out that the carbs would have to
be taken off to fit under the trailer hitch, I finally managed to lure the
beast out of its cave and have a good look at it.  In hindsight it probably
would have been much easier to get rid of all of the exhaust equipment first
but who knew?  Anyways just a couple of questions, first of all how tightly
is the cooling tin supposed to seal the engine compartment.  There seemed to
be a centimeter gap or so around the sides of the tin and I'm not too sure
what the deal is.  also how many pieces of tin are there?  My second
question is what the heck is that big sausage sitting on the left hand side
(Left is Driver) of the engine compartment. Am I blessed with some sort of
auxiliary heater or what.  It has some german writing on it and has a tube
which extends into the cabin but has no gas lines which lead to it, only a
few wires which don't seem to lead anywhere.  Anyways that's it for now
tomorrow I start tearing everything apart, and looking for my little lack of
compression problem.  Thats it for now
