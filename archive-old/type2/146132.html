Subject: Re: [T2] Paint new trailer to match my bus?

Hi Teri,

If there's a professional, old-school sign shop nearby, drop in and  
ask if they still do signs with enamel paint. The sign industry uses  
a special blend of enamel that is available in a wide range of  
colors, goes on super-smooth with a brush, lasts a long time and is  
very, very opaque. It ain't cheap, but it's a good fit for what  
you're trying to do.

Otherwise I'd recommend a good gray primer under the beige, and  
expect to use multiple coats of the beige.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I just got a new trailer from Horrible Freight, and am  
&gt; contemplating rattle-canning it to match my bus.  It's a typical  
&gt; cheapie Chinese thing, the paint is thin in spots and dinged from  
&gt; shipment.  I had picked up a spray can of automotive paint at Wally  
&gt; World a few years back that was a great match for the Mexico Beige  
&gt; of my bus to use for touchup, hopefully they still carry it.
