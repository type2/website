Subject: the carburetor small round plug plate?

This morning my wife tried to drive to her exercise class, but though
the engine seemed to idle ok, it had no power at all, and coughed and
sputtered when trying to accellerate. She gave up, parked it and
drove the other van.

I looked at the engine later and discovered that the little round
(about the size of a dime) dust (?) cover on the back of the
carburetor was missing. Can these be replaced? maybe glued in? Muir
does not mention this cover in his book. It is a Solex 31PICT3
carburetor. I put a 31PICT1 spare carb in its place as a temporary
measure.
