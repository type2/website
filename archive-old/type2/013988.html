Subject: Nut size on the exhaust studs

Was wondering if someone could answer this question.  This past
weekend I was removing the heat exchangers from two different 1700 cc
engines for a 73 Bus.  On some nuts I had to use my 13 mm socket and
on others I had to use my 12 mm socket.  I can't remember if it was on
the nuts closer to the case or the other way around but there seemed
to be a consistency as to which nuts used which socket.  When I
reinstall the nuts, which some I need to replace, can I just use a 13
mm  or what?  The size of the studs are the same, just the nuts are
different.  Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kevin
