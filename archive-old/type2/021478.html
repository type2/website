 Quoth Jon R.:
&gt;I took the air filter off which is the oil kind and it idle even better and ran stronger (a lot stronger) but it still is weak. How can I go about fixing this.&lt;
....in your case I'd first suspect blocked (dirty) air cleaner.
 
It's been a while since I had a 71 with a carb, but I remember one trick
in checking idle mix the gurus may wish to comment on-......slowly block
off the air with a piece of cardboard and notice what happens before it
dies- if it gets better before dying you were likely too lean; if it
seems to do nothing and die with just about 1/2&quot; of space left it's
correct; if it dies before this you were too rich to begin with.  Can't
remember if this works when running it beyond the idle curcuit.
