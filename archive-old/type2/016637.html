Subject: Alternator woes

Hello All,

I am a long time lurker but rarely post. I am taking the plunge today
though at the risk of embarrassing myself. I have consulted the library,
the archives, the Muir book, and the Haynes manual. I know the basics
about cars and have some hands-on experience. Lately it feels like the
more I learn, the more I realize how little I know.

A few days back the alternator and oxs lights came on, and stayed on,
when I started up my '82 Westy in the morning. The oxs light I knew not
to fret over but the alternator light worried me. I drove it though and
predictably, the battery eventually died and the car is now a
nice-looking flowerpot. 

Here is what I know: The alternator belt is intact but has kind of a
worn stripe along the outside of it. Other than that, there is no
visible fraying. The belt feels tight (about 1/2&quot; play in it when I push
down in the middle) but I haven't checked one before so it's hard to
compare. The alternator itself does spin when the engine is running and
there are no funky noises emanating from it. When I loosenend the
mounting bolt and tensioning bracket, and then tightened the belt, the
alternator light stayed on. 

What I don't know: 1)When I should give in and replace the alternator.
2)What it means that both lights came on simultaneously. Could there be
some simple wiring problem going on?
3)If I should bother checking the brushes because the light came on
suddenly and strongly (I -mistakenly?- assume that bad brushes would
lead to a gradual decline, flickering light, etc.)
4)What I should try next...

I would love to fix this one myself. The independence factor is
obviously important but also I would love to save some money (especially
after spending thousands in September to replace her pistons, cylinders,
and heads). 

Can anyone out there help? It would be much appreciated.
