Subject: why the red light?
Message-ID: &lt;0.89cea88b.25525d6e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well, my dash had a new addition, a red light.  We couldn't have that so I 
took care of the problem in one swift shot.  New alternator, regulator, and 
battery with cables and all new fuses and a belt.  I thought for sure my 
problem was soon to pass.  All installed (still whining) and the red light is 
back to pay me a visit again only not as bright, almost glowing.  When the 
bus is running the light can barely be seen, turn signals on and it starts to 
flash a little bit brighter glow, then headlights on and it becomes a 
constant very soft glow, but evident.  What gives I've replaced everything 
and there are no new changes in the electric department to explain this.  I'm 
looking for any body with a similar experience or story (with conclusion), 
because my buddy Murphy has long term reservations but the banker says throw 
in the towel.
Peace Out
