I am currently employed in the Advertising Dept of a medium-sized upscale
retailer, based in mid-Michigan. My main function is print production, with
a minor in riding herd on a bunch of creative types Macintoshes (you would
not believe what these people will do to an innocent computer!).  My bus
helps me to reconnect to what is real and good in this world, after
spending all day selling high-priced junk to people who don't need it.
