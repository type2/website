Subject: RE: [T2] What's wrong with it now.

Did you check to see that your getting voltage to the coil? If it's hot
I'm assuming you are though. How are you testing for spark at the coil
btw? Might you be doing something wrong their? Try connecting a probe
between POS and NEG on the coil Terminals, and turning your engine over.
That should tell you if your points are opening and closing. They need
to close to ground the coil to make spark. The probe should light on and
off as you spin the engine. If it doesn't go on, then you should check
out your points and/or the wire coming from the distributor to the coils
NEG post. 

If the probe DOES light, but you have no spark at the coil itself, then
double check your getting good high voltage at the coil. Other than
that, I'm out of ideas. 

Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt; After turning over the engine my coil was pretty warm to the touch,
so 
I checked the spark from the coil. It appears I have no spark. I 
thought the coil must be the problem so I installed a new one. 
Evidently the coil wasn't the problem. Still no spark.

Any ideas? Thanks.
