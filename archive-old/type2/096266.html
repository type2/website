&gt; okay, i understand. the lock nut i am able to buy, but the rubber boot -
&gt; no? my FLAPS feller told me there was no rubber of any kind on the other
&gt; side; that it was tapered metal and that was enough. we couldn't find an
&gt; exploded view of the valve. no improvising on the rubber, huh.

try a good plumbing supply house they have just about every shape washer
you can imagine.  bet something would fit, and since it is &quot;only&quot; vapors
maybe the rubber would hold up a reasonable amount of time, and the part
would probably be 10cents max
