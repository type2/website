Subject: flatbed trailer needed for borrow and barter

hey guys, i need to borrow a flat bed trailer to get rid of my 72 bus here
in a few weeks.  does anyone in so cal (long beach area preferably) have
one i could borrow for a few hours.  i'll let you have my front suspension
off of it even and it also has the dash padding in great shape if you need
that which i'm sure fits 68-72 but i'm not sure about later busses if it
fits.
