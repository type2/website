Subject: Re: [T2] A possible solution to leaky S-Boots?

Busahalic said: &quot;I have read, in this list, several references to
&quot;intake gaskets&quot; in the past couple weeks. I decided
if I kept quiet that I would eventually get enough
clues to figure out what they're referring to. Okay,
this is it! WHAT do you mean by &quot;intake gaskets?&quot;&quot;



When you say &quot;intake gaskets&quot;, are you referring to this post??

on 'throttle body seals' - I am sorry, but I could not find the recent
threads about intake gaskets
