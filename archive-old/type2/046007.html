What a trip!

Good ol' Lurch made it just fine somehow.

I left Knoxville, TN for Brevard, NC about 7:00 PM.  For once I decided to 
top off the tank (it was 3/4 full to begin with).  I usually just put 10 
gallons in, run it out, then calculate MPG (10 is an easy divisor).

For a bus with 95psi in #3 (all others are 120) and a 4th gear that's held in 
by a bungee (I had to stretch it even more this time), the trip was entirely 
uneventful.  I found the place (WAY off the beaten path) in the dark -- drove 
up about 10:45.

The festivities were in full swing.  It was great to meet familiar 
acquaintances, and I met new ones.  What a great bunch!  And the place!  This 
was the first annual in a long line of Picasso Moon &quot;bus festibals&quot; (Emma's 
words). 

Alas, neither Emma, Greta, or Melissa made it this time and I was bemoaning 
this fact to everyone there, especially after DocRic and Teddy got there 
Saturday around noon.  This is a place where dogs and kids roam free, and 
moms &amp; dads and everyone else just sort of mixes and mingles.  Lurch will be 
full of people (and pets) for next year's event.

Saturday night multiple pots of chili were offered up for judging by the 
masses.  I forget who won, but we all enjoyed A LOT of chili.

The weather was perfect.  NO RAIN!  Highs maybe got up to 70 - lows in the 
40's.  I got some sunburn.

The drive back was REALLY cool.  Five buses formed a caravan down about 10 
miles of windy one-lane dirt road through the forest primeval.  We arrived at 
the fish hatchery on the other side of the mountain about an hour later.

&gt;From there it was the 3-hour drive home.  Again, uneventful, but I really, 
really, REALLY gotta put another engine and tranny (they are waiting in the 
garage) in Lurch before the next &quot;bus festibal&quot;

Oktoberbus, maybe?
