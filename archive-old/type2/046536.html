&gt; I am interested in getting a roll out awning that would attach to the
&gt; rain gutter

i've been contemplating the carefree sidewinder II. i've seen a few vans
around town with them. they unroll from the bottom which should minimize
leakage. you can add on camper rooms/screens; and they have mounting
brackets for buses. cost looks around $300 for the awning and brackets.
