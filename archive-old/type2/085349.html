Subject: Need left rear quarter window frame for a '72 Westy-WTB

Hi all,

I'm in the middle of restoring my '72 westy and am in need of a part. When
removing the left side rear quarter window (fresh air window) I found that
the frame was rusted beyond repair. Rather than source a whole glass window
from another bus I am trying to find the correct window piece for my Westy.

As Westy parts (windows) are as rare as hens teeth over here in good old
Sweden, I am asking if any of you listees might have one you are willing to
part with.  If you should happen to have one or any good tips, please p-mail
so we don't waste bandwidth.

TIA,

John B.

'72 Westy
'65 Beetle


And: my previous '72 Custom Camper. I bought it back from the guy I sold it
to who, it turned out, was actually evil and should never ever have had a
bus....especially mine. It will now go to a GOOD home.
