Subject: Re: [T2] k&amp;n air filter

George(and all),

One of the best things I ever did(besides this list) was to 
sign up for an online subscription to autospeed_dot_com.

Mostly because I was looking for good serious *tested* articles on
engine and car improvement.  They guy who does the magazine is(in my 
opinion) fantastic.

In one article, he show how to hunt for &quot;negative boost&quot; in your 
intake....in other words, anything that causes a restriction in the
air intake...all the way down to the heads.

He used a Dwyer Magnehelic Differential Pressure Gauge,  which is an 
expensive version of a very sensitive vacuum gauge that measures from two 
different places...for instance, before the air filter, and after the air 
filter.  I actually own one of these devices now.


After looking at the article(well actually a *5* part article, his results 
matched what I had read about air filters before....they just don't 
restrict the air flow that much(infinitesimally actually, as long as they 
are ****clean****).

So, I won't buy them for my cars.

Disclaimer....I *do* own a pair of them because that is all I can find to 
go on webber 48 ida's...and the ones I have, I custom fabricated to fit 
under the deck lid of this car.  
http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/pumaengine/picture-002.html

Yes, they are nice when you custom fabricate(re-engineer) them and you can 
clean them and re oil them.  I suppose that you could also make an 
argument on the environmental side of the issue for them as 
well...I.E....reuseable rather than use and trash.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Here is an interesting test of K&amp;N against other filters. Granted, the base subject was a Chevrolet filter,
&gt; &gt; but the comparison was using other filters that fit the same vehicle. It would not matter if it were all Yugo
&gt; &gt; filters or all Mercedes filters. The results are not skewed.

&gt; &gt; I would love to see REAL results to contradict this, NOT seat-of-the-pants BS like 'It felt more powerfull'
&gt; &gt; crap.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For my street-driven cars I wouldn't run a K&amp;N on a bet.  They let a lot
&gt; of small particulates through.  In the short term this is not a problem,
&gt; but the long term effects are not good.
