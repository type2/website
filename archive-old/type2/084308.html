Subject: Re: [T2] Engine installation woes...

Tom,

On a type IV motor the flaps are essential.  Without them, the fan does
not push air through the oil cooler.  You *can* live without the
thermostat, but your new motor will not live long without the flaps...

Remember Kettering's words... &quot;Parts left out cost nothing and have an
infinite service life.&quot;  If the motor didn't NEED those parts, VW
wouldn't have spent the money to put them there.  If you mechanic
doesn't understand their importance, it's time to find a new mechanic.
(Or become your own mechanic!)

Jim
