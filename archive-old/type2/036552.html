Subject: Update on my '69s turn-signal/brake light problems (ideas?)

All,

Well, it's been snowing/raining here for the better
part of the past week, so I wasn't able to do any real
diagnostic work on my '69s turn-signal/brake light
problems (right-rear turn-signal and brakelight don't
work; all other lights *do* work).

I do have another piece of the puzzle though. When I
push down on the brake pedal, there's a distinct
tinct-tinct sound...like a relay opening and
closing...that comes from under the dash. It doesn't
happen every time, either. It seems to me, that this
sound was not always there, either.

I crawled under the dash the other day and tried to
locate the source of this noise and it seems to be
coming from the turn-signal relay box. It's also the
*exact* same sound the relay makes when you turn on
the turn-signals, but shorter in duration (like if the
turn-signal light blinked on, then off only once).

This leads me to believe that it's this relay unit
that is causing my problems (the brake light wire goes
through this relay box as well). This was suggested to
me by a fellow listee as well. But I talked to several
parts-knowledgeable people and one solid mechanic and
both doubted the relay box could fail in this manner.

Has anybody else experienced this? I'm not exactly
flush with cash right now and don't want to  spend
$40.00 on a new one if it's not the problem.

Muir's test only covers it if the unit has completely
failed, which mine hasn't; the other three turn
signals all work.


As usual, any help will be greatly apreciated!


Jaime
