AMEN TO THAT;-) Just check out the various different
SO-67 versions there are...sheesh!

It seems a fair amount of people (myself included;-)
have simultaneously decided that covering the poptop
hole is a good idea for several reasons. I find it
rather interesting that we all came to the same
conclusion at roughly the same time, even though I've
never seen/heard of anyone doing it before. Is this
kind of like the &quot;100th Monkey&quot; thing, or what????


Anyway...I have a few things people might want to
consider before installing the sunroof to block the
hole (though if they can be worked-out, I think it's a
great idea):
1-How are you going to secure the poptop with the
sunroof closed? On my '69, there are 3 rubber
hold-downs that run from the poptop, *through* the
hole, and secure between the &quot;roof&quot; sheet-metal and
&quot;ceiling&quot; sheet-metal. It seems there might be a
&quot;version-conflict&quot;, here ;-)

I suppose you could simply put some of these same
straps on the outside, but that seems to be a bit
risky...anyone could release them while you're at
work, in the store, etc. Why tempt fate?

2-Even with all of my straps in place and a new poptop
seal, my top shakes, rattles and rolls when I pass a
semi heading the other way (not to mention when I used
to travel through the Columbia River
Gorge.....GGGGGGGOOOOODDDDDDDD....SCARY). It seems to
me, that sealing that hole with a sunroof would make
matters even worse, as the air/wind would be trapped
between the poptop and the sunroof.

Granted, after '70, you have that nifty little hook
(yeah, I'm jealous, so what???;-) that holds the front
down, but still, it seems you are tempting fate again.


Now, if it seems I'm a bit paranoid, there's a reason;
I had my poptop go up while I was driving across the
Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Or...a mere 3 days after
buying my bus! The top was missing one of the front
straps and the other was pretty cracked, but I thought
I'd be okay for a few days, when....

I was hit by a sudden 40mph side-gust while travelling
at 25-30mph. The only thing that saved me, was the
fact that seconds before it happened, I saw one of
those 100' long American flags atop some building
across the river go from hanging-limp to pretty much
horizontal in the blink of an eye and slowed down... I
was also able to grab the remnants of the
previously-cracked-strap as it gave way and kept the
top from going &quot;full-gonzo&quot;.

I was white as a sheet before I got the bus to the
other side of the bridge, but I'd have to say; the
guys driving behind and to the side of me looked a
*lot* worse than I felt! If you've ever been over the
Hawthorne (or any bridge in Portland), you know why:
LOOOOONG drop to the water....plenty of time to ponder
your fate, balance the check-book, brush/floss, write
your memoirs, etc..! 8-]


So....I'm just a *little* paranoid about this
particular issue! To this day, I carry *two* spare
straps and check them religiously, before, during and
after every trip over 20 miles!!!!


Just be careful!
