Subject: Re: GEX Fallout

Yeah... you said that your Bus needs work in other areas, right? Your
best bet is to try to fix up your bus, with the GEX motor in there. Just
use the GEX motor for what it's worth and for as long as it'll last.
There's really nothing else you can do unless you have the space to pull
the motor and have the bus sitting around until you can piece the motor
back together. 

By the way, you don't happen to own a 1982 Pontiac TransAm, do you?
(sorry, bad joke)

&gt; Todd ,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the email of hope. I am going to pull this engine very 
&gt; soon and 
&gt; hope to find better than expected situations. I can already see 
&gt; missing 
&gt; parts of this and that. I just want to know about the good 
&gt; experiences with 
&gt; the engines and then I want to know what are the major problems to 
&gt; look for 
&gt; without saying complete tear down, although I think it is inevitable 
&gt; for my 
&gt; piece of mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
