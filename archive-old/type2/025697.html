&gt; I forgot to mention this, the mechanic who told me to use additional
&gt; support told me that letting the tranny hang makes the driveshafts
&gt; function as a tripod hence aolt of compression forces placed on cv's etc
&gt; and the thrid part of the tripod being the mount on the front of the
&gt; tranny, it makes sense to me ... the three manuals i have all say to
&gt; support the tranny.

Huh? If the transmission is attached correctly to the vehicle, there is a
bonded rubber mount at the front (BTW, anyone know where to get these? I
need a new one) and two bolts on top of the transmission at the back. (In
your Bentley, these are part no. 3 in the picture of the transmission,
diagram 4-1.)

With it bolted in at both ends, there shouldn't be any compression forces on
the CVs.

They told me the same thing about Bug transmissions, and I even bought some
angle iron and chains to hold the transmission in when I did a Bug...hmmm,
what are these two huge bolts doing here?
