&gt;Oh, my, there are so many!  My personal favorite is, &quot;If you drive a T4
&gt;engine bus and your gen light comes on, you can keep going because the fan
&gt;is bolted to the end of the crank.&quot; This one, too, is absolutley FALSE!
&gt;We have had half a dozen cases (one recently) on this list where the fan
&gt;hub or bolts sheared off and the fan stopped turning (and cooling the
&gt;engine).

Of course, if you get out and verify that your fan is still turning and the 
belt has simply broken, then you can keep going.  Happened to me once and I 
was very happy to have a type IV engine... that day.  :-)
