Why does the gasket for the standard three bolt header always
discenigrate?
The one that goes between the Header and the muffler.  Every time I
change that gasket it is gone in about a week.  What type of gasket
should I be using to stop this problem?  I use the cardboard looking
ones.  Also does anyone make  a hideaway muffler that tucks up under
the rear of a 68 bus?  I have dual Quietpacks on a lowered bus and they
bottom out frequently.  Please don't tell me to raise my bus to fix the
problem. I already know I could do that, but I like it lowered.
