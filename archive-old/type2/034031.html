Subject: Weber fuel pressure to high ?

Hello Everybody,

Need some input here.

On a '72 bus - I'm replacing the dual Solex carbs on a 2.0 liter engine
with an electric fuel pump.
Going on is a single Weber two barrel conversion. The only number I know
on it is the order number
43-0670-8.

I got the carb kit today and I read in the directions to install a
pressure regulator to reduce the pressure down to 1.5 to 2.0 psi.

Anybody ever run a Weber without the pressure regulator. How well will
it work without one ? Any recommendations where to get a pressure
regulator without having to order it. I'm in San Francisco.

The reason I'm asking is I wanted to install the carb tomorrow and take
the van out of town next week.

I don't want the begin if I have to go find a regulator.

Thanx for any suggestions.
