&gt; Hello all - 
&gt;  
&gt; I have a Vanagon 81 with Automatic.  I need a gasket for the final drive bottom pan, and I'm also leaking out the Govenor, so I need new gaskets for that.
&gt;  
&gt; Any idea where I can order such things?  The Bus Depot can't get them.
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks -

First, I haven't bought from these places but found them in some quick 
searches (they seem to list some transmission seals)....

requires Java  -  https://www.rockauto_dot_com/dbphp/mak,VOLKSWAGEN

Also, according to:

http://www.gowesty_dot_com/AT_failure2.htm

the AT section hasn't changed since '72 and the designation is &quot;010&quot; and 
was used in Audis and VWs until '93.

A full rebuild kit is listed for $195 here:

Hope this helps...
