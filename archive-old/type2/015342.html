Hello Volks,

After some dianostic work I discovered that the poor performance of my
beloved 81 Vanagon results from the #3 cylinder not firing.  I have
replaced the points, plugs and plug wires and set the timing and point gap
with a dwell tach and timing light with no improvement. I then pulled all
the plugs and noticed the #3 plug was covered in black soot. Next I took
the plug wires off one at a time and there was no difference in the running
of the engine when I removed #3. Replacing the #3 plug and plug wire with
one from the old set also made no difference.

I think I have pretty much nailed down that #3 aint firing.

There is a clacking noise coming from the 3 and 4 bank but this doesnt seem
to have changed and this noise has been in the engine since I bought the
thing two months ago. A look under the 3 and 4 value cover didnt indicate
any problems....everything looked and felt tight and in good working order.

What I plan to do next is:

1. Run a compression test to see if the clacking noise is more than I think
it is.

2. Test the fuel injector on the #3 cylinder per the Haynes manual.

Am I headed in the right direction or are there other things that I should
do or consider first.

Thanks for the help and the great advise I get from this list.
