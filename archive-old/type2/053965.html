I have used it and it has been an essential tool with my new engine which is
larger and has a higher compression than stock but I am using the stock CA
FI unit and exhaust.

I think it's worth the cash but I spent a lot on my motor and needed to make
sure I was getting it to run richer than stock.  The fuel injection was
continually trying to put the ratio at about 14 to 14.7 to 1 and I needed to
be at 13 to 13.5.  The gauge allows me to get a pretty good idea of what the
mixture is under load (driving on the freeway) 
Getting the fuel injection to run richer was another story.

I've been browsing around and I've come upon an A/F Gauge from C.B.
Performance.  Has anyone tried this unit and is it worth the cash?
