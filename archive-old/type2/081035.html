I believe that a cb with a linear amplifier would do just that when the mic
is keyed. Perhaps George would know more. Might be fun to key down and watch
the flames from the trunk

&gt; I'd love to create some radio transmitter that would overcome the stereo
in
&gt; the next thumper car that came along and help them appear to tell the
world
&gt; all their inner secrets at top volume. Some sort of Buck Rogers
transmitter
&gt; ray gun...
&gt;
&gt; I'll never forget a large truck in Italy that had such a high power
&gt; transmitter on his radio (would it still be a CB in Italy?) that he broke
&gt; into what I was listening to on the tape deck in my car.
&gt;
&gt; Sounded like an Italian speaking devil - all deep and rumbling. I did not
&gt; know what it was at first and it scared the hell out of me!!!
