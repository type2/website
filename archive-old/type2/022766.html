Subject: Westy  Tent poles - how many???
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Anyone know how many pieces are needed for the frame of a 68-70s Westy tent ?

I do not want to go put it up just to check if I have them all........

I have  4 corners with a small pole attached (welded)
2 of the center peak connectors
and 14 straight poles

is that right ?

thanks for your help.........
