Subject: Re: [T2] Better gas mileage by attaching a metal garbage can
  lid to  front mounted spare?

&gt;The spare in front that produced less wind resistance
&gt;in my testing over the years had an insert of
&gt;corrugated plastic to keep the tight-fitting vinyl
&gt;cover nice and flat in front. A large rounded style
&gt;hubcap would probably be even better. -BaH

To make a better slipstream around the front mounted
spare tire I am using an older Mercedes-Benz hubcap.
It's the metal painted style hubcap found on the 108,
114, 115, 116 &amp; 123 series MB cars.

The metal clips on the hubcap hold it firmly onto the
stock steel VW bus rim.  It will not blow off the rim.
