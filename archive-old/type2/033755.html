Subject: Getting Engine Ready

I have spent most of the day getting the 1/2 inch layer of oil and muck off
of my engine tin for the 1800 longblock I hope to receive this week. It has
been chore but I want the paint to stick when I spay it.
I have some regular auto paint that I used to paint a bug pan with, can I
use this paint on my tin? Or do I need some High Heat Paint?
Thanks
