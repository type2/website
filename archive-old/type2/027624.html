Frank, and anyone else running a non fuel injected bus.
   There is another filter in the bottom of your gas tank on a 71.  It 
usually doesn't get changed or cleaned and you wind up with 30 years of 
&quot;stuff&quot; in it which blocks off fuel flow.  I had the same problem last year.
   You'll need to drain your tank, and then right at the outlet on the 
bottom, you'll see a hex.  Remove the fuel line from that fitting and then 
using the hex, screw it out.  Now pull the filter out of the hole and I bet 
you find it covered with rust and who knows what else.  I guess you could 
clean it, but I put in a new one with new seals.  Check the various 
catalogs, most of the vendors have it.  If you have the time to pull the 
fuel tank it would be ideal to flush and seal it now.  I didn't, so instead 
I flushed it in place using gallons of alcohol.  I poured it in and then 
caught it in a big metal pan.  I was able to run it through the tank several 
times before it all evapoated.  It washed out quite a bit of stuff into the 
pan and then evaporated quickly, so I didn't have any disposal problems as 
you would if you used other solvents.  And of course this would be the ideal 
time to REPLACE YOUR FUEL LINES and filter.
   Good Luck.
