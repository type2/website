&gt;On a whim we asked these girls to model for us.  Chicks dig vans.
&gt;http://www.firestrike_dot_net/van/sitings/
&gt;(check the ladiesvan pics.)

OK, I gotta know:  How did you get two lovely young ladies in scanty outfits
pose next to your bus!?

I've been driving a bus for over 13 years and all I've ever managed to
photograph with my bus is 
   a: guys with loud Hawaiian shirts and beer bellies
   b: skinny guys with long hair that haven't bathed for 2 weeks
   c: guys with no shirts and goofy grins  

Being a guy myself (and fitting each of the 3 above descriptions at some
point or another), I really don't find any of my bus pictures worthy of
posting to the list and saying, &quot;Hey!  Look at these great shots!&quot;

So what's the secret?  Blinding good looks?  Telling them you work for
Rolling Stone?  Cash?  

I feel like Wayne and Garth in &quot;Wayne's World&quot; when they meet Alice Cooper,
&quot;We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!&quot;  :)
