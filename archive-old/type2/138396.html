Hm.  Maybe that's why I've dropped from ~17-18 during the summer to 
~15mpg now, (yeah, ok, there were a few stretches of 75MPH freeway 
driving in that latest computation which is bound to affect the result) 
... though I don't recall exactly what California does wrt seasonal 
formulation changes.

My father-in-law works for ExxonMobil ... maybe I'll ask him for the 
low-down.
