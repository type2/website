Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus 1600cc dual port connecting rod

&gt; I guess the bearing in the &quot;new&quot; rod isn't
&gt; thick enough?

Playing mix and match with these parts isn't a good idea.  You probably
have a crank that has been machined undersize and a standard rod bearing.
Your best bet is to figure out what crank you have and then to buy
appropriate new bearings to fit.
