Subject: [T2] My New Van is on my web page now, and bumper still for sale

Hello all,
  I finnaly got around to putting up new 85 Westy on my web page. I still have
not gone to pick it up so these are just the pictures that the owner(previous)
sent me. I will be picking it up around the 1st. I plan to go get it with a
dolly, but it does run. It has 175K on it, so I am making plans to drive it
till it quits, but in the mean time I am saving up for parts to do a Jetta/Golf
engine conversion. I will update more as time goes on.
  I still have the 71 Bus rear bumper for sale. This is the one with the super
hitch. I will let it go for $75, or I will take it to the spring meet with me
and get ride of it there. I am willing to hold it if needed as long as I get
the money up front.
So have a look at both my new van and the bumper, they are both on my web page.
