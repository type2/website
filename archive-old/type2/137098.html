Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 master cylinder WTB

Craig,
	The one I purchased from Busdepot a year or two ago came with two brake 
light switch hookups. It was ~30.00 (perhaps more, I can't really 
remember as it wasn't very expensive...). I did, however, have a problem 
in that the bores into the cylinder to which the brake lines attached 
were too deep. I had to change out the metal lines to get connectors 
that would actually seat correctly in the master cylinder. I went to my 
local foreign car parts store, and their master cylinder had the same 
problem.
	I hope yours doesn't. Anywho--that was my experience.
