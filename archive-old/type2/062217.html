&gt; Bradley,
&gt; The truth is you should only expect about 19 mpg in stop/go traffic
&gt; Maybe 24 mpg at max on hiway-only driving.
&gt; 
&gt; If your #'s are below this, I would recommend firstly using 87 octane
&gt; gas EVERY TIME.  It WILL give you the best mileage....
&gt; Also, try a bottle of Chevron Techron(the original stuff).
&gt; This can be had at your FLAPS for about $6.
&gt; Run the bus w/ this stuff and see how your mileage is after like 4 tanks...
&gt; 
&gt; -PaulThanks for the advice.  BTW what is FLAPS I have seen this several times 
on the list threads but I have not seen it anywhere else.  Is this a 
chain store?  I'm in San Fernando Valley are there any around the LA area 
that I should know of?
