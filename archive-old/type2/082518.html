Subject: ac &amp; engine pull

hello-

I am dismantling my '78 Bus (stock) for restoration &amp;
I have the dealer-installed AC system.  I plan to keep
the system, perhaps replacing the york with a sanden. 
For now, I want to get the engine out and wonder how
to deal with the attached compressor.

Can I detach the hoses from the top of the compressor
and drop the engine with compressor attached?

Can I detach the compressor leaving the hoses attached
(bloody knuckles, for sure) from the engine and set it
aside in the left &quot;battery tray&quot; while I drop the
engine?

Is it common for AC repair shops to have a mobile
discharge unit that can come to my house and discharge
the AC system (cheaper than towing the Bus to a shop
for this operation)?

I promise to take plenty of pictures of the process to
add to the list archives/library in exchange for any
help you can provide here.

Thanks
