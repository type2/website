&gt;The brown
&gt;viton seals are fantastic, and worked well on my bus.

I have been unable to order these lately either from Bus Depot or German Supply. From Bus Depot the small seals were brown but he large ones green (or vice versa).

Whatever viton seals you find, be sure to have them on hand to replace all of the seals. If you replace just the ones that are leaking but remove the tubes to inspect the others, you may find that the original black seal has swelled with oil and will not go back into the bore.

&gt;You shouldn't
&gt;have to put any sealent on it. I just used a bit of motor oil as a
&gt;lubricant to help get it to slide in.

Agreed, just oil. I recently saw this advice to use loctite 518 on them but it's surely a bad idea:
