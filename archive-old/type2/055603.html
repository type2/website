&gt; 
&gt; Try a shot of starting fluid ( CAREFULLY).  If it kicks over momentarily, you have a fuel problem. If it does'nt, you have a spark problem. This usually works for me when i'm alone and have no one to man the key for me. Good luck. Jim Duncan OUT

Another way is to smell for raw gasoline at the tailpipe after cranking.
I had a fuel pump go out on the road and that's what twigged me to not
getting gas to the cylinders.
