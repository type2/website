Subject: Re: [T2] Bus-boys ball joints

Just a small point of experience (like the point on my head).

I had a local shop replace all four of the ball joints on my '73 panel
last year.  This shop was recommended to me by my VW oriented FLAPS who
highly recommended that I don't do this job myself.  I supplied the ball
joints and the shop did the labor for $260.00.

Afterwards, no more squeak squeak and the ride seemed better.

I thought all was fine until I lifted the van and pulled the wheel to
work on the drivers side floor board.  Much to my horror, there was the
upper arm with the ball joint hanging 3/4 of the way out of the arm.  As
I lifted the wheel, the ball joint slid in and out of it's socket on the
arm.  I looked the procedures up in Bentley and saw that once the joint
is pressed into the socket it is supposed to be press peened (my term)
on top so that it will not slip out.  It was obvious that that part of
the installation was not done.  After looking at both the arm and joint
and one of the old joints (souvenir) I decided that the arm and joint
would have to be replaced.  In the mean time it would be safe to weld
the two together.  So I pressed the two together using the weight of the
van and carefully used a drift punch to ensure they were seated
together.  Then I carefully ran short weld beads around the top until I
had a full bead all the way around.  They won't separate anymore and are
holding together fine until I replace them with a proper set from
Bus-Boys or other source.  I also confirmed that the joints were no
restricted in motion.

When I asked the shop about how they did the job, the explanation was
that they did it all on the van.  They did not remove them and use the 6
ton press per Bentley.

I don't know what would happen down the line, but I could just see
hitting a bump somewhere just right and having the wheel fold under the
van at 60 mph.  Not pretty.

&gt; Dear List,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm starting a full body transplant and the new body needs, among a hundred
&gt; other things, all four ball joints replaced. I noticed bus-boys have ready
&gt; to go joints and torsion arms pre-pressed.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 211-498-101BX  Torsion Arm Set (4) Bus/Pickup 1970 to 1979  $174.95 set PLUS
&gt; $50.00 Core Charge
&gt; 
&gt; Far less expensive than my outstanding local shop. Plus, I get to do the
&gt; work. Has anyone used these and is this a good idea? Any thoughts? Is there
&gt; another way without using a press? Heat maybe? Any thoughts appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Brandt
