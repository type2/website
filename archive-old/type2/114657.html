&lt;&lt; thanks for all that can shed light into a oily place...
lol.. &gt;&gt;

From the we kid you not file:
                                            You might have to call around 
various
FLAPS to see who carries it, but there is a flourescent dye that 
can be added to the oil to trace leaks. You'll need a &quot;black light&quot; bulb
in your drop light to see it, but it does work...Add the dye to the oil
and fire 'er up (evening is obviously best...) and watch for the light
show... 8-)

Next week: How to &quot;colour-tune&quot; your engine... ;-)
