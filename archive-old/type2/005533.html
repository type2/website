Hello All,
 
LONG time lurker and first time poster, I finally got the time to begin the overhaul of my 76 Westy. She's got a 74-75 1800 single weber carb and mech adv 009 Bosch dizzy. My questions are a follows:
 
    After compression test due to lack of power, discovered that cyl 3 and 4 are at 0. Pulled the motor, tried to remove the head over 3/4 and it is stuck to the cylinders. Also the 4 piston is frozen in the cylinder. Any idea on how to free this mess? Is it worth rebuilding or should I start new?
 
    If I purchase a rebuilt motor, I am thinking of putting in a 2.0L motor with hyd. lifters. Are the motors interchangeable in buses and is there any advantage over solid lifters?
 
Thank you ahead of time for your help. All of you have made a world of difference in my air cooled education thus far.
 
Chris Hengstenberg
76 Westy Deluxe (eventually)
