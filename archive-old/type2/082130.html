Try this for the repair on the reservoir---

( I repaired my expansion tank yesterday on my 85 GL this way )

Take a Weller soldering gun, with the plastic cutting tip on it, and
heat the area that is cracked until the plastic gets to a molten
state--and move the gun back and forth over the crack--it'll weld it
closed.

Then I roughed up the area with 80 grit paper, and laid a patch over the
welded area with some 3-M plastic bumper repair material---

This repair worked under the pressure and heat of the cooling
system----I believe this would do just fine for a repair on the master
cylinder reservoir also---

For the paint color, have the paint supplier
 look into his paint books---- It would be easier to at least tell him
what year, and vehicle the paint was available on----


Later,


Terry

Hello all, I need a brake fluid reservoir for my 1968 bus. I am going to
try to jb weld the old one, since it doesn't need to hold any pressure,
just fluid. But would like to replace it with a new one if possible.
Looked at Rocky Mt., but couldn't find it there. 
Plus, what do I tell the person who is painting my bus &quot;exactly&quot; what
&quot;titian red&quot; is? 
Thank you very much,
Jennifer of South Carolina
