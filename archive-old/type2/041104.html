Subject: Re: Tires and rims (Bay / Vanagon)

Hi,
	(Hey, Jan: you misspelled &quot;tyres&quot; :-)

&gt; Continental is AFAIK the 'the default' tire for all VWs (I suspect
&gt; VW has a stake in Conti).

 In the UK, at least, T4s come with Klebers from the factory. Kleber
are owned by Michelin. OTOH, Audis and (as you say) T3s came with
Contis.

&gt; However recently I choose the new Michelin Agilis81 for my '81 Vanagon.
&gt; These seem to be very good strong tires with a high load ratio and and
&gt; awesomely big thread.

 Yeah- I just got these for my new alloys in a 195/70R15C. They are great,
though not as sticky as I would like. Maybe the Agilis-51 in 205/65 would
be better? Sami- do you want to try these out for us? :-)

 I believe that the Agilis range replaces the older Michelin van tyres like
the MXLs and MXTs, as well as the XC-4S and XCA. There are different models
suitable for busses as follows:

 14&quot; Rims:

185 R14C AGILIS 61 TL 99R		(6-ply rating?)
185 R14C AGILIS 81 TL 102R		(8-ply rating?)

 15&quot; Rims:

195/70 R15  AGILIS 41 RENF TL 97S	(Reinforced: note lack of &quot;C&quot;
suffix)
195/70 R15C AGILIS 61 TL 100R		(6-ply rating?)
195/70 R15C AGILIS 81 TL 104R		(8-ply rating?

205/65 R15C AGILIS 51 TL 102T		(Higher speed- VR6 T4?)

 They also do some 195/75R14s (106R), if that's your thing. Check out:

	http://www.michelin_dot_ca/ca/eng/news/agilis/1.htm

 ... and links, for the full story. Interestingly, they don't seem to do
a 205/70R14 tyre.

 Steve- do you want to add this to your tyre library (I have 195/70R15C
Agilis 81s on Mercedes 15x7&quot; rims and am very pleased with the stability,
a considerable improvement on the 185R14C 8 and 6-plys I had before).
 I wanted to respond to your original request for info but the tyres I
was using at the time were all over the place: off brand items in different
ratings- so wouldn't have added much value.

Cheers,
	 W.
