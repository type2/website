Subject: Re: [T2] strange thing by my front wheel

This would be the receiver-dryer. This is part of an
a/c system. If the hoses have been cut then this is no
longer any good. This is a part that is often replaced
when refurbishing an a/c systen that has been
disassembled for any length of time. the descant
inside becomes ruined by prolonged exposure to outside
air. If the rest of your a/c is gone and you don't
plan on reinstalling it, toss it. If you want to
reinstall the a/c, keep if for reference when you go
to buy a new one.

Have a great day!

&gt; can anyone enlighten me? in trying to do the

&gt; strange object mounted to
&gt; the wheel well. ... i
&gt; asked pete and he said
&gt; it looked like an A/C hose... said hose also comes
&gt; out under the dash,
&gt; with a connector on the end that someone told me
&gt; looked like an A/C
&gt; connector... now pete said the thing in the wheel
&gt; well looks like it
 does anyone know for sure what this thing is and
&gt; what else i need to make
&gt; the A/C work (including the parts that mount to the
&gt; engine)... at this
&gt; point, i have hoses and this odd thing, if it is
&gt; even an A/C part, and i
&gt; am not even sure it still works!

&gt; thanks for your wealth of knowledge,
