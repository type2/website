Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus brake booster vacuum hose

Hi Jenny,

I don't think the brakes have anything to do with it. I think it is
just a convenient place to get manifold vacuum.

 I looked harder in the manual.  EGR system has a line going to the
 brake booster vacuum line.  This is supposed to go to some sort of
 solenoid setup, and allow vaccum to get to the diaphragms on the
 intake manifold.

 I cannot find this solenoid.  I can't even find where the small tube
 from the brake booster went to.  The T on the vacuum hose is forward
 of the 1 way valve.  Somehow the brakes control EGR?
