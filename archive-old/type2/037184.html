Subject: Re: Key Blank Source

&gt; &gt;I've searched the library, archives and net for an NOS or repro key for
&gt; &gt;my bus, but can't find one.  I think WWest and RMMW carry them, but not
&gt; &gt;the L-profile.

I got 2 steel key blanks for my 73 Westy from RMMW about a year ago.  That was
the easy part.  The harder part was finding a locksmith who would cut 'em, since
they're steel.  I went to three places before I found a guy who was willing to
do it, but I think he was regretful afterwards.

Oh, and if you can, get the original key code to have a brand new key made.  I
did this and it made a big difference in how easy the key was to use, especially
on the ignition.
