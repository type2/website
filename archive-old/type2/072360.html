Yakima has some great stuff have one for my jetta, and my 79 westfalia.
For camper tops you need the A1 towers with the side loader mounts, 
you have to drill into the camper top (missing the canvas) and bolt 
it on. One thing tho, Yakima told me that two bikes are ok, but 
getting anything larger might be a problem because the air traveling 
under the kayaks/canoes/etc pull forces upward. This can cause the 
rack to possibility rip from the top onto the road/car behind. I only 
intend to have my mountain bike up there (maybe my road too or a 
friends bike), but just as a precautionary measure I picked up a tie 
down strap with the hooks, the kind that cranks tight used for back 
of truck beds, at Kmart. Im going to hook it under the gutter of bus, 
strap it though the top tube of the bike(s) to the other gutter and 
crank it down. I figure it will help to keep the top from wanting to 
even come up.

&gt;I need to get some gutter feet and a rack that will hold my
&gt;
&gt;windsurfer above
&gt;the roof of my 72 Riviera. 
&gt;
&gt;Grant,
&gt;  Although I dont have a westy. My impression from the Volks
&gt;in the Wet Westy tribe would indicate that you could look
&gt;into Yakima Racks. They have many more configurations than
&gt;what you might think. Good luck!
