Are you sure it's bearing noise?

Just a dumb question, but have you recently installed new tires? can they be 
rubbing on something when you turn? or maybe something is under your 
wheelwell?

Probably not, but you never know.

&gt;List-
&gt;Haven't posted in a long time but I try to keep an eye on what is going on.
&gt;I have what I think is wheel bearing noise in the front end of my 72 Westy.
&gt;I hear it when I turn   but not when going straight. I took one hub apart
&gt;and all is well. However I can't figure out how to set the play that is
&gt;supposed to be there. Haynes says .03 -.12 mm at the spindle.  It also
&gt;says: &quot;This seems like a lot and can result in some quite noticible rock at
&gt;the outer rim of the wheel&quot;
&gt;How much rock? Does anyone have a procedure for getting this right? If
&gt;there is that much play maybe the bearing noise while turning is normal.
