Subject: Custom Wheels

Has anybody had any success recently in finding custom alloy wheels to
fit their bus? My bus is a '79 Riviera with a 5-112 bolt pattern and I
can't find any wheels other than the stock ones. I'm looking for a 15,
16, or 17 inch wheel with a mid offset.  I've tried the American Racing
Aero, but the dust cover on the axle hub protrudes too far. Who makes a
wheel that fits out of the box?
 
Thanks
