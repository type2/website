I'm wondering just how hot my heater tubes might get?  Reason, my connecting pipes (between heater box and heater controls) are rusted, and a new set would cost $140 for both (busdepot_dot_com).  I was considering rapping the rusted pieces in a layer kitty-hair Bondo for a fix.  Or replacing with small dryer vent pipes.

I know this might be a bad idea because they might get too hot, or would they? 

Also, is it a bad idea to use a 3 inch PVC pipe in the straight section after the heater controls?  I replaced the old drip-fuel heater unit that was rusted out.
