Subject: Alcohol instead of petrol/gasoline (Brazil?)

I thought in Brazil they run almost all gas engines with a alcohol mixture.

Given the experimentation with electric / propane / -- is there any
advantage to running alcohol fuel instead of petrol/gasoline?  Besides the
political benefits of staying out of middle east wars, is there any
environmental benefit?

I presume that are beloved Type1 engine is run in Brazil with alcohol --
I've heard reference to this, but not seen a good discussion on it.

Any technical information on the differences?  It is just normal carbs with
some mods, or a completely different carb setup?

Or, I could have all my facts wrong and this topic should die off :)
