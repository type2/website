Subject: Re: [T2] Propane stuff and tips

&gt; to  avoid this, give the container a shake after you fill it.  If you
don't
&gt; feel a good slosh, vent some of the propane back into the big bottle
&gt; before the little bottle warms up.

I would agree that's sound advice....I've never seen a propane cylinder
explode .... but I've heard it's possible. I am rather happy that our westy
tanks are exempt from the OPD valve requirement but I'm told it's not easy
to overfill them if you use the proper technique of opening the vent valve
and filling until you get liquid propane out of the vent valve. You are
supposed to stop filling as soon as you get liquid out of the small vent
valve... then you will be at 80 percent full and &quot;safe&quot;.

As far as the law goes, I'll keep $500 handy just in case I have to pay the
fine for transporting refilled disposable containers. Because, to simply
pick up a canister and carry it across the campsite could be technically
considered to be transporting it..I guess... remind me to avoid traveling
with Bus driving police and lawyers and Federal Agents ..... it makes these
sorts of issues non-events.
