Subject: Re: [T2] carb question

Zach, I'm with you, man. My 71 1776 dual Kadron setup lets me reach the 
right hand mixture screw only. The doghouse is totally in the way of the 
left hand carb's screw. I asked the nice guys at RAMVA for suggestions 
on how to &quot;remote&quot; the adjustment and a lot of ideas were tossed around, 
including magic bendy screwdrivers. The best idea there was to shove a 
bit of fuel line hose (or other) over the head of the screw, and bring 
the other end rearward so you can grab 'n' turn. John at aircooled_dot_net 
claims you can reach around the left carb with two hands and grab that 
screw between opposing fingers. I need to try that. Will discover how 
hot is is in there.

I'm installing new linkage on the carbs in a couple days and will try 
these ideas to see if it is humanly possible to adjust the mixture.
