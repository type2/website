Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

&gt;Other than than being in violation of several Federal laws with
&gt;hefty fines?? Besides, unless the donor bus is old enough to
&gt;be exempt from inspection, how will a diesel pass smog??
&gt;Of course, having said this, I've driven a bug made out of any
&gt;number of other parts and a windshield VIN and title from an
&gt;already cut up and disposed one...

Actually the diesel may pass smog quite easily in a number of
states, as in, it won't and won't have to.  A few diesel EV's have
made it in this way apparently.  And the bus body should be crash
worthy but perhaps not for it's year (80's or 90's) of manufacture.
I'd bet in most free living states though emissions may be a non
issue.  Still not cost effective, buy a diesel Vanagon out of a
yard, weld up a motor mount bar, toss the thing in.  I really doubt
this will be as much effort as some of the naysayers have whined.
I say this because 1. I have an article somewhere from the early
80's of a guy who did it with a turbo which is a whole other can
of complications. 2. Diesels are dead easy dumb, like the fuel
system is a joke, you run a hose from the tank to the injection
pump and that is that, no electronics, no ignition, no complications,
if it ran in the source vehicle it will run in the Bus with the attachment
of one big honking wire to the battery for the glow plugs. 3. Mechanical
wise it will be a joke IF you get the diesel parter, in fact with the extra
bus tranny hanger supports assuming those mounts are on the
diesel bellhousing (which may in fact not be true) it could be a
real joke as the rear hanger wouldn't need to be much, even if it
did you can bolt it all up and just jig it in place to attach to a cut
up bus mount bar.  My worries off hand are length which may or
may not be an issue as both have type 4's stock but the Vanagon
tin is a bit deeper so you may have to chop up the rear sill on the
bus a bit but no more than an inch or so I reckon, and of course
the cooling.  That will be the number one pain in the but with this
conversion just like it is for any water cooled bus conversion.  I still
recall this guy angling two big motorcycle radiators in the back
corners, relocating the battery inside, and avoiding the long front
to rear coolant lines, real slick install idea.  I don't figure height will
be an issue as the bus compartment is much taller than the Van.
You'd also need to rig the throttle cable, big whoop tee do there.
I'd guess a '74 tranny would be ideal for such a conversion with a
normally aspirated engine as the 4.57 will be a bit too much 
overdrive for a diesel 1600, but I'd say the 4.83 combined with the
lighter weight of a Bus would make the finished product even or
better than a Vanagon diesel, but that certainly doesn't say much.

I think it's a real interesting conversion idea, it's a proven conversion,
most of the parts are bolt in, it would probably turn in 35mpg or so,
and that engine is a 250k mile mill.  I think doing it with a 1900 normal
aspirated (if you drive to Canada and find one) or better yet with a
1600 turbo (fairly common to find in '88-'91 Jettas) would make for a
real neat 45mpg bus that would probably best a 2.0 up through the
gears until the very top.  A TDI would likely best any US production
VW transporter made until the VR6 but that would be a royal PITA.
