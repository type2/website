Subject: Re: [T2] Reversing exhaust manifolds and bending some exhaust
  pipe

Hi Courtney,

I considered that, but the first muffler guy I talked to came up with  
the Harley pipes and the conversation stopped then and there.

If I was gonna Y the system I would design the system bring the  
exhaust forward, then connect the pipes up front and bring the  
exhaust out just behind the driver's rear wheel. Running the muffler  
in that location would keep it in the slipstream and there would be  
less heat radiated towards the engine air intake.

Happy trails,

&gt; After checking out Greg Potts Harley pipes welded to reversed exhaust

&gt; Greg et al, what do you think of some exhaust pipe bent to fit and Y'd
&gt; together. These would then allow an aftermarket 40 dollar muffler  
&gt; from a FLAPS
&gt; etc. to sit sideways across the rear of the van just as the stock  
&gt; one does.
&gt; I'm thinking replacing a 40 dollar muffler 4 times would still beat  
&gt; the cost
&gt; of buying one stock muffler for me up here in Canada. If the pipes  
&gt; were
&gt; ceramic coated, they'd last forever.
&gt; I am NOT interested in having heater boxes, so that argument is  
&gt; null and
&gt; void.
&gt; Would love to hear any feedback on this idea, pro or con.
