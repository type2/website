Subject: 1971 Bus Air Conditioning??

I have a 1971 Bus which I would like to get some form of air conditioning
in.  I looked in the archives and only saw a few articles for 1972 on up.
Whether I have to hang one, or stick on between the seats.. it doesnt
matter...

Is there any VW or after market solution anyone recommends.  The engine is a
fairly beefy new engine, so I should have enough horsepower for it.

Any suggestions are apprecaited!

Ken
