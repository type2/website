Subject: BN 4 Gas Heater FS

 I used to be active on this list but ran out  of time and unsubscribed b/c of too much e-mail even in digest mode...  Anyway I have a BN 4 heater to sell and thought I would ask you guys,  before I list it on E-Barf. I have pictures I can p-mail. It is missing  the exhaust pipe and dash controls. Everything else is in good order  and I fired it up a year ago to make sure it worked, Its been in my  attic ever since. I was thinking $200 but make me an offer or tell my  why I'm crazy to ask that much... Oh yeah I'm selling it because I  found a BA 6 for my bus. Located in Annapolis, MD. 
  
  Thanks
