Subject: Bigger seatbed into 78 Westy
Mime-Version: 1.0

I had a query on this, and am posting what I did to replace the rear
seatbed with a wider one from a 74 Westy:
     I decided that the space/usefulness ratio of the frig. was too high,
and removed it.  We rarely need the frig when hauling people around town,
and when camping, I use either a Coleman thermocouple frig (usually for
long trips) or a rolling cooler that has lots of room, doubles as a camping
stool, and fits behind the passenger seat (turned either way), behind the
seatbed, or BETWEEN the sink/storage unit and the rear seatbed (with the
table brackets removed; never use the _at_%##$ heavy, spacewasting table
anyway- whewn camped I use a folding table; when rolling I made one that
flips up from the sliding door, and made a hinged one (from the top of the
front between seats table) that sits nearly level with and rearward of the
Deluxe sink cover.
     Also took out the seatbed, and installed the triple seatbed from a 74
Westy (blue/green plaid- goes nice with my Hunter green bumpers and tire
rims). The fit is fine but I didn't want to lose the rear closet shelves to
the small cabinet of the 74, and modified the 78's by cutting the doorway
in the SIDE of the cabinet, blocking off the original hole with a
foamed/uphostered panel (same plaid taken from old seat).  The cabinet was
cut out below where the flipbed will hit it when pulled out; it's about 4&quot;
up from the &quot;floor&quot; and 2&quot; back. This can't be seen when seat us up.  Also
one has to drill a hole to insert a bolt for the bed upper bracket, and
there is a lower bracket that is bolted thru the wheelwell (mirrors the
other side).  The floor bolts are the same.   Paneling was scrounged off
the 74 to piece in what's exposed next to the seat.  I put speakers inside
the green armrests/side padding on each side of the bedseat.  Got lots of
room now underneath and put in an inverter
and a converter; inverter powers electric planket when rolling.  I added a
3rd shoulder/seatbelt (taken from a front seat) that can be bolted to the
hidden existing hole under the rear window (look at passenger side to
measure it; I used a 1.5&quot; circle saw at the right spot thru the wood panel
covering the window to bolt it in; you &quot;could&quot; remove the rear closet to
get this belt in also.  The lower part of the belt was bolted to the wall
where it forms an&quot;X&quot; behind the paneling.  I wanted this as a semi-shoulder
belt to make sure that if one bends forward, you can't hit your head/chin
on the Frig/storage unit.   As for pics of this; if one has room on a web
site, I could scan some and send as files .
