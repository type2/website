Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust manifold heat shield

Hmmm... I just looked at them again and there is definately some kind of
material that lines these shields. They *are* VW manifolds as I can still
make out the VW symbol stamped into them. Could the shields be something
that some one put on themselves? They are formed and shaped to match the
manifolds and look to be crimped to hold them on at the top. It looks
somewhat like the same kind of cardboard type material that is sandwiched
between the metal exhaust gaskets.

Should I just take the shields off or leave them on?

&gt; There is nothing between the shield and the manifold from the factory.
Just air space.
