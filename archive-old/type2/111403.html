Subject: Re: [T2] Seats

Dang! I keep forgetting that people NOT in California don't
ahve such access to the goods!  I have the origional seats
from the '80 westy in my friends attic...was going to
install in the '78 westy, but if I can get teh BMW 325is
leather ones to fit, they may come available...not
realisticly able to ship over there though...in the
pick-n-pull yards here they are often abundant.

&gt; &gt; Put Vanagon seats in it.  On the driver's side, it'll
&gt; slide right in.
&gt; &gt; Passenger side you have to add the seat tracks.  A
&gt; worthy addition.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have a `77 Bay, and I would be a happy camper to
&gt; find a set of usable
&gt; (not mint) Vanagon seats for my bus somewhere near to the
&gt; Augusta, Georgia
&gt; area.  Heck, I'd probably consider throwing some repro's
&gt; into the deal.

&gt; Anyone got the goods out there? :O)
