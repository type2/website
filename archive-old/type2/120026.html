Subject: Manual tranny oil

Rus-
Typically the gear oil never needs changing.  However, you should 
change it after a tranny rebuild or if you just want a fresh start.  It 
certainly can't hurt and one benefit of changing it is to upgrade to 
synthetic.
I recommend Redline MT-90.  Great stuff- you'll notice a difference in 
shifting, especially in cold weather.
You'll need an M17 Hex head wrench or socket.  Loosen the filler first 
(on the side of the trans. and loosened first in case it won't loosen 
so you don't drain prematurely) then loosen the drainer (on bottom) and 
drain.  Refill with a pump until it flows out and cap it fast.  If you 
use the Redline, it comes in small bottles (you'll need 4) and you'll 
have to cut the tops off to make the pump fit over them.  If you use 
Sta-lube or whatever, the pump fits right on top of the gallon container.  
It is a very easy job assuming your plugs are not stuck tight.  Good 
luck.
