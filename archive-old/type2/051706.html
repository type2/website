Your comments would apply equally on this side of the Pond...

For nearly 50 years I've dealt with a local, single store, family owned
FLAPS.  Because a son [now owner] spent time overseas in the service back in
the '50s he brought an interest in foreign-made vehicles into the business
upon his return to civilian life.

At least 9 times out of 10 I can walk in the door 7-days/week and the person
at the counter can pull what I need right off the shelf.  Doesn't matter
much what make or model of vehicle.  If it's a real emergency, and the exact
part isn't in stock, the staff's enormous knowledge and experience means we
can usually put our heads together and fabricate or jerry-rig a fix on the
spot to get by until the precise part is delivered.

These folks have found rare, oddball, and obscure brake parts, engine
bearings,  and engine gasket sets for me from sources all over the world
when no one, including sources in the vehicle's country of origin, could
supply the needed parts.

This point was driven home yet again recently, when I need a little molded
hose for a Ren**lt's cooling system.  Officially NLA from any source - the
local independent parts and repair shop has been scrounging for replacements
for over 2 years.  Not only did my FLAPS have it in their computer, they had
2 sitting on the counter in 24 hours for  ~$3.00 each!

I don't doubt for a minute that much of what I buy could be obtained
elsewhere, often at substantial savings.  But in the long run you really do
get what you pay for, tangibly and intangibly.

The name of the FLAPS is Narrows Discount Auto Parts, of Tacoma, WA, and I'm
proud to be their customer.

OBC:  Two years ago Narrows was about to close, and they sold off their
large stock of air-cooled VW parts and accessories..  Loyal customers
convinced them to stick around.  They've also re-stocked their VW stuff by
popular request.  And the real kicker here  -  the owner hates VWs and has
never even ridden in a Type 2...

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  In the end a big DIY store wants to sell 10 6&quot; wood screws in a nice
plastic
non bio-degradable pack for £3, where as my local hardware store will sell
the 2 that I need for 50 pence &amp; they come in a brown paper bag! For the
sake of  pocket change use your local stores, it's good for your local
economy &amp; community. Just visit any area where most of the local stores have
closed down, the local area begins to degenerate as jobs are lost &amp; passing
trade in other store reduces. Just my rant (and all over a hose!).  &lt;&lt;
