Subject: Re: [T2] Door locks

Thank you, George! I haven't even looked at the article yet, but now that
you mention a &quot;little spring&quot;, it makes perfect sense. The door lock
mechanism works, but doesn't quite activate the mechanism. It feels as if a
little extra push or pull is needed, and a little spring could do just the
trick. ;0)
