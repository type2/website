Subject: Original Fuel Line Clamp removal

Hello Guys and Gals,
I seem to have a few clamps that resemble a spade or a diamond or even a
heart shaped top.  The camp appears to be solid.
I have mangled two now in getting  the fuel lines replaced.
Any helpful hints to removing these before I hurt something?

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
