  Advice?

You can replace that vent window with plexiglass. We often did this in Naples, IT when there were not any donor windows to be had. 

My CR-X had a plexiglass &quot;window&quot; in the rear hatch for about 4 years. Finally I could no see through it, was cracked and such. Went to a junkyard to look for a few minor items I needed and found a whole hatch with glass intact for $60. May your fortunes be so good. 

Chris
