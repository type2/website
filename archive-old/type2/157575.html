Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Heater Group Buy

I'll look into that. I think I have both parts lists
around here somewhere but it may be July before I find
'em! The diesel one I have works great. Two gallons of
diesel will run it 24 hours a day for a few days -
full blast! (Full blast would cause you to leave the
slider open in 20 degree cold!) -BaH

&gt; &gt; citing liability.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have access to a parts list to see what
&gt; parts are different on the
&gt; diesel versus gas heaters?  I'm willing to bet that
&gt; the difference is just
&gt; a jet or nozzle.  Buy the diesel heater, retrofit
&gt; the gasoline part(s) and
&gt; you get the heater we need.  The manufacturer is off
&gt; the liability hook
&gt; since the customer altered the heater.
