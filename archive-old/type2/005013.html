Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

There's a company somewhere (eastwood?) that makes a kit for welding on an
estension for broken exhaust studs with a mig welder.  I recently had to do
something a little bit similar with my mig welder.  I wanted to take the
strip off my Riviera top that holds one end of the canopy.  This was held on
by a bunch of steel screws that were so rusty the slot in the heads would
crumble when a screwdriver was turned in them.  I mig welded a nail to the
screw heads, and sometimes just the heat was enough to unscrew them without
even attaching the nail.  When I did have to weld the nails on, I was able
to just twist the screws out with the nails.

For head studs, best thing may be to weld a nut to the broken stud.  This
will tend to confine your heat, and will give something to pur a wrench on.
The heat may loosen up the threads.

Regards,

Grant
