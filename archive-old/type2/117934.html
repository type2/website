Subject: Re: [T2] Where do you keep your fire extinguisher?

&gt;Hi Volks- I just checked my fire extinguisher and found it was out of date.
&gt;Bought a new one (5 lb) and need to know the best place to keep it

Hi Ted,

I keep mine bungee-corded to the vertical arm of the parking brake 
mechanism, right in front of the shifter and behind the veritcal heating 
duct.  Keep it on the passenger's side of the arm, and you don't have to 
worry about it getting in the way of the pedals or the driver.  I tried with 
several places, but a 5 lb extinguisher is difficult to stow where it can be 
easily accessed at the speed of a gasoline or propane flame front.  Despite 
the fact that it's not the most aesthetically pleasing place, it is very 
accessible, and the bungee cord attachment makes for one less thing to worry 
about in case of fire -- just grab the handle, pull it out of the bungee, 
and get to work!

Good luck, and as always, YMMV.
