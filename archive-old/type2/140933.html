Subject: RE: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

So....I had thought about this.  But wasn't sure about a couple things.
One, where would I attach the come-a-long?  Could I take chain between the
two front D rings in the floor and place the come-a-long in the middle?
Also, I have had a hard time finding one with enough cable to reach all the
way out the back of the trailer.

Any thoughts?

Thanks again,

Troy Wical

I dunno much about winches.. I have always used a hand come-a-long rated at 
about 1 ton.
