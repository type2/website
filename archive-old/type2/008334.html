Subject: Re: Engine Advice on 36hp Deck Height 
Cc: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;I had gotten to the point of measuring my Deck height of my 36hp engine that
&gt;I am rebuilding only to find a fairly large discrepency in the DH  #1 .050&quot;,
&gt;#2 .040&quot;, #3 .025&quot;, #4 .032&quot;.
&gt;Now I thought I had done everything right as I had sent everything to Rimco
&gt;for machining.
&gt;I the following done:
&gt;Bore checked (which was in spec)
&gt;Deck Height (resurfaced cylinder openings)
&gt;Crank polished
&gt;Rods rebushed and honed (They checked and threw out a previous set for being
&gt;out of spec,  I thought I was having them checked for end to end length also
&gt;but it does not look it from my Deck Height results)
&gt;Everything dynamically balanced(crank,rods,pulley,flywheel,pistons).
&gt;Heads flycut rebuilt etc. (46.5cc per head opening)
&gt;
&gt;The question I guess is it most likely coming from the rods, or maybe from
&gt;mis-aligned crank bore.  And if its the Rods since I have had them balanced
&gt;should it be ok to simply shim each cylinder to the maximum Deck Height of
&gt;.050 and a CR of 6.6 (will be Judson powered if this makes a difference).  I
&gt;am not sure if I can get custom thickness shims to match them.  I will call
&gt;Rimco on that.
&gt;If it is the crank case bore should I rip apart everything and get it align
&gt;bored?
&gt;Any other ideas as to what it may be?
&gt;

  Craig . . there is a post called &quot;balancing the CR, long 'n short
of it&quot; which leads to a couple others that get into details . .

 David Raistrick has up on his site . .  or archives 

 Basically it amounts to the fact that all these parts, including
the case have tolerances for the machinist to work to . .
Say plus or minus .005 inches . .

 You will have parts in spec even tho they are 5 mils short or 
5 mils long . . from one to the other tho, they can be .010&quot; diff.

 So you have a deck face at the spigot opening, a rod length, 
a piston from pin to top, a jug length that could add up to .040&quot;
(1 mm) from your shortest to your longest . .

 So the idea is to get these all labeled and put the long rod with 
the short piston and the long piston/rod in long hole of case and
juggle the jug in there too . .

 You shift these around until you have less than .005&quot; difference.

 Normally you can achieve this without machining . .
