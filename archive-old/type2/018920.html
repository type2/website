&lt;&lt; My opinion on this subject is that the factory is well aware that buses 
run 
 hot.  They run so hot that they often fail catastrophically because of it. &gt;&gt;

I suspect it has much more to do with maintenance and driving habits and less 
to do with a corporate conspiracy dating back to Ben Pon and Hienz Nordhoff.  
: )  I never drove my old type 1 powered buses faster than 60 - 65 mph and 
always practiced by the book maintenance.  I did not have a temp. gauge and 
never felt that it would tell me anything other than the obvious.

I routinely see folks driving the same 1500 and 1600 buses during the heat of 
summer at speeds approaching 75 mph.  I suspect all a gauge is going to do is 
tell these folks what they should already know about their vehicle and don't 
want to hear, SLOW DOWN, it will run cooler and last longer!!!  

If you have to drive at these kind of speeds get a vehicle that is designed 
to_better_take_it.  If you want an aircooled VW bus, a late 2 liter bay 
window bus with bigger oil cooler, bigger main bearings, better oiling, 
bigger valves, tougher aluminum case, oil filter, fuel injection etc. will 
take higher speed operation and last a bit longer.  A gauge on one of these 
buses will no doubt also give you the same somewhat obvious information.

One of our &quot;wet westies&quot; members just did battle with a VDO cylinder head 
temp setup that was discovered to be off by 150 degrees.  It_helped_him waste 
several days valuable time trouble shooting non existent problems!
