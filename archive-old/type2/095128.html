Subject: Re: [T2] cv boot kit


&gt;
&gt;My Meisterwhatever kits had the little crimp clamps.  Unfortunately the
&gt;boots didn't last all that long once on.  I think that quality varies
&gt;widely.


I've used the RHineland boots, and I've used American boots, and I've got to 
say that the M**g boots were the best quality.

	Just my fiftieth of a dollar...
