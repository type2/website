Subject: Re: [T2] sceond battery ... or the xpower600?

I saw that too, and I think it's a pretty neat little package.  A 
lot of functionality for the money.  The battery inside, at 40 amp-
hours might be a little small depending on what you would use it 
for.  It would only power the inverter at full load for ~20 
minutes.  Don't believe the &quot;1200 watt surge&quot; rating - it will 
shut down at just above 600 watts.  If you were going to buy the 
inverter, battery charger, and jumper cables anyway, then it's a 
great deal.  On the other hand, you can get a 90 amp-hour battery 
alone for under $50.  The battery will also tuck neatly away under 
the seat whereas that xPower device will probably not fit.

&gt;I was in Sam's Club today and spotted this gizmo:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.statpower_dot_com/xPower600.htm
&gt;
&gt;I was about to install a second battery in my '71 (even bought 
the relay from 
&gt;Bus Depot), but this looks like it might be a better gimmick.
&gt;
&gt;It recharges principally with AC, but can be recharged with its 
DC/cigarette 
&gt;lighter adapter, too (as long as the car's running).
&gt;
&gt;It was about $140 at Sam's.
&gt;
&gt;Thoughts?
