Subject: Re: gas leak

-----------------
i came out to discover a puddle of gasoline
underneath the drivers side of the vehicle. i popped
the engine lid and to my dismay saw gas running down
the inside wall(and coming out the bootom of the
vehicle). what the hell is going on here!!!???  
-----------------
  There are metal condensation lines that run from the
firewall area (driver's side) towards the back of the
bus...and up into the vent area. If you look into the
vents you can see them. Trace the lines back from the
vent with your hand...unless you are into sticken your
head in the engine compartment.... Anyway! at some
point you will feel a short length of rubber hose
which is a splice as the metal line is not one
piece(length) it does have a break which requires this
rubber hose. This section of hose is generally unknown
and not looked at.. say around 6&quot; long? cant remember
for sure. At any rate betcha a Guiness extra stout
that this is your problem. Replace it anyway.. easy
maint. item.
