&gt;Volks- I need an oil filler tube for a type4 engine (1800). I guess it

&gt;old engine. I'm supposed to leave for a  long trip in two weeks, and I
&gt;can't go without this part. 

Search the yellow pages on line for Avver's, Longview, WA. They will have
your filler tube used, as well any VW dealer if new means anything. Rocky
Mouintain Motor Works is worth a try, as is Bus Depot.

For those metal shards  to get to the filter, they will first have to run
through the bearings to the pan then to the oil pump and finally to the
filter. A bearing will get starved if a single shard  clogs an oil galley.
If it makes it through the galley and into a bearing, it will score the
bearing and crank journal. That's one shard of a few thousandts inch size
or larger. 

Sorry, but that is the ugly fact. If the filter would catch shards in that
area, no one would need mention the necessity of no shards at all in this
procedure.
