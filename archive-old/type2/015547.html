&gt;    Help, please,,,,,,,
&gt;This morning I went out to start her/him up, to no avail.
&gt;I tried to crank it over &amp; wound up once or twice then ALL power went out.
&gt;Dome light, Radio, etc,,, I got my trusty digital meter out, the battery
&gt;seems fine, power going to the starter. Every so often Either I wiggle
&gt;something or about every 3/5 minutes the radio &amp; dome light go back on, I
&gt;try to crank it again, they go back out. &amp; no turn of the starter. Could it
&gt;be the starter???

Verify good contact at both ends of the posative and negative battery
cables, then verify good contact at the ground cable from the front of the
tranny to the chassis. If the battery is old and filthy, replace it, or at
least clean it and load test it to confirm function.

Make sure the starter motor bolts are tight as well. Sounds like main
voltage path resistance due to loose and/or coorroded connections. Could as
well be the ignition switch contacts for the same reason, coorroded/pitted
contacts. Verify voltage drop from Batt + to starter solinoid feed from the
switch. If less than 9 volts at the solinoid, it's a switch path problem.
If 9.5v or more, it's a burned/pitted starter. Jump the ignition feed
terminal at the starter to the large Batt + stud with a 10 guage wire to
activate the solinoid. If that don't work, run the jumpwire from the Batt +
post at the battery. If now it works, it's a main cables problem. If that
don't work either, the starter motor ist toast. 

&gt;PLUS, I am moving in the end of June, SO I have already sold it for $600.00
&gt;to a friend &amp; Im sure they would like the thing to be running.

If you already sold it, you don't own it any more. Let the owner be
responsible for getting the vehicle out of there. No rational person would
sell a vehicle for $600 and warrent that it will start and run tomorrow. If
you got cash in hand and signed the title, point to the new owner if
someone asks you about it. Let them know they are in peril of getting towed
and YOU can't do anything about it.

Otherwise, if you don't have the $600 in hand, then it isn't really sold.
Hook a rope to it and tow it out of there. Then push start it and drive it
to an alternate site, like the new owner's driveway. Then get your $600,
after offering them further inspection if they wish. Old T-II's many times
come with old starters and switches and aftermarket relays and such and
they are getting what they are paying for, super low bucks for a chance of
some miles with no serious problems, like no-starts, or no brakes. If they
did a reasonable inspection, they know of the weaknesses in the vehicle. If
they didn't, well, who is obligated to protect fools from themselves???
