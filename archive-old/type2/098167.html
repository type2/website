Subject: Re: [VB] lube it or just go at it dry?

When I was running AA Fuel Dragsters and AA Fuel Rails and Even 266cid
Inboard Hydroplanes, we chucked up (in a lathe) a modified dummy piston,
clamped down the rings and cut a bevel on the rings.
They seated in one minute and ten minutes later were turning the engine
9000 rpms.
Never knew if it was an oil burner but it used 6.5 gallons of 98% nitro
methane racing fuel in less than 1/4 mile.

&gt; Dave, when I was racing at Bonneville in 75 we used zero clearance 
&gt; rings on
&gt; bone dry freshly honed cylinders. But this was a first time up the 
&gt; track
