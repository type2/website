Hey, idiot, just because you got burned is no reason to call me a
ripoff! I don't try to make my mortgage payment from 1 sale,  as I'm not
really in the business of selling used VW parts. Just because I can get
better deals than you means 1 of 2 things: I'm in a place that doesn't
have the obviously higher overhead your location, or that I'm a better
bargainer than you are! Not a ripoff, just have better person to person
skills. Folks around here don't put such a high value on 'old Volkswagen
parts', cause they're just that, old car parts. If you want to debate
why I can get them cheaper, I suggest you give me a call, as I will be
posting my newest finds real soon.

&gt; I do not know WHAT fantasy world you live in, BUT if you LOOK at what
&gt; shops
&gt; charge for cores you can see my price is in line and NOT price gouging
&gt; as you
&gt; charge.  And should I JUST give you the block, no better should I pay
&gt; you to
&gt; take it because is SO cheap???  I THINK NOT.
&gt;
&gt;   The T4 engines ARE not being made and that drives the cost up, plus
&gt; it is
&gt; highly sought after especially for the T1 to T4 conversions.
&gt; SO do not ask me to sell it cheap JUST because YOU are TOO cheap to
&gt; pay a
&gt; fair price.
&gt; SO do you buy cheap and sell high??? As you continue to rip off the
&gt; unsuspecting...

I don't want your parts, as I have 3 2.0L cases and assorted parts.
