Subject: Re: [T2] RE: jalousie windows &amp; cup holders et al

That's a beautiful list!!

My comfort mods are:

Small console between front seats with cupholders and storage.
Electric 12v/Battery cooler for drinks and snacks when on longish trips.
Fast and the Furious purple fluorescent light wired to switch over
sliding door (hey, it was $2.99 at Pep Boys!)
Started tinting with 3% pass tint. I suck at tinting, but it's better
than the bubbled and faded stuff that's there now.
Padded seat covers for front seats. Pass seat has no padding left, so
this is all it gets. Driver's seat has TMI pads under the cover that
blow chunks. Saving for WW hair pads.
Carpet and 1/3&quot; padding all around.
$14 speakers in custom door panels.
$9.99 box speakers on the top bunk for rear audio.

I could talk about all the stuff I &quot;plan&quot; on doing, but who knows when
I'll get one of them roundtoits.
