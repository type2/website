Subject: Re: shifting problems

Okay guys, I need some help again on my 71 bus.  The  last two days I 
have 
been having a difficult time getting the bus in  reverse.  When I think

I have 
it in reverse, it's really in second.  I  let the clutch out and it 
moves 
forward so I disengage the clutch and have to  push down hard and move 
the stick to 
the left almost touching my right leg and  then it will go in reverse. 

-------------------------------------------------------

Sounds like the linkage coupler is giving it up.. back at the tranny
linkage interface. 15 dollar or so part. keep the set screw from
the original as it is real steel... the ones that come with the
new couplers are crappy.
