Rich -

Something doesn't sound right. If you checked the oil just a days prior (but
how many miles?), I can't believe you ran it out of oil.

You said the engine stalled, as if some electricity wasn't where it was
supposed to be, not &quot;The engine made this horrific chunking noise as it got
real rough for about 3 seconds, then locked solid&quot;. Did the oil pressure
light come on?

Were you there when the mechanic first checked the dipstick? You also said
there's no glaring signs of oil seeping at a rate of .7 qts per day?

Something just doesn't pan out - not that I'm calling the mechanic a
rip-off, or anything... Well, okay, I might be. I'd ask for a detailed
analysis of why he thinks &quot;engine is shot&quot;, at the very least.

&gt; i thought it was a loose battery terminal...the
&gt; mechanic said those 3 little words, &quot;engines
&gt; shot...sorry&quot;.   He said there was no oil in the
&gt; engine, i saw no telltale signs.
