&gt; i will gladly contribute to any fund you may have for those flowers. The 
&gt; tragedy touched so many of us, it would be nice to participate a bit and you 
&gt; don't have to feel like you need to foot the bill for all of us. (Alhough it 
&gt; is much appreciated)

same here, post an address to send a check
