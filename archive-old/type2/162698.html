&gt; Sounds exactly like Nyssa's 75 bus problems- great spark, all checked

&gt; the thermotime switch was not letting the cold start valve get juice for
&gt; adding gas while cranking.  Easy to check with voltmeter.  Since the TTS

would agree with you except it is very easy to flood, if I crank too much
I have to let it sit for a while (15-20 minutes) then it will start right
up,.  worried that it was fuel presure but when I put a guage on the fuel
ring it was textbook to spec and held the presure for two days...


&gt; is in an impossible spot,

an understatment if there ever was one

&gt; Another issue was that she had sticking weights in the distributor that
&gt; really messed up the starting timing and rpms after being hot-(left too
&gt; advanced)- figured this out with a timing light used AT STARTUP, and
&gt; noticing it would not always drop after advancing- beat on the body of
&gt; the distrib. and it drops back down.  Switched her distrib. with (Thanks
&gt; Teddebare) the $5 one from Ted's bargain box.

don't think that is it, have checked the timing with a light and it is
where it should be.

the temp sensor sounds more like it. but I am often wrong

thanks
Bob
