Subject: Re: [T2] custom exhaust

&gt; I was thinking about making a custom exhaust for our 2.0l bus engine. I have
&gt; good heater boxes but thought maybe I'll eliminate them cause we dont drive it
&gt; int the cold, and I thought maybe a little less weight is good. So my
&gt; question is, what about running this bus with a custom exhaust and how much back
&gt; pressure should I worry about or the more open the better. Thanks any help is well

I have run my 2liter for over 100,000 miles with just J pipes connected to
the regular muffler.
