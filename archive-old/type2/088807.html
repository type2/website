You are correct, EZ.
For this test, a little play in
the front wheel bearings is good.
Thanx for reading .

&gt;Correct me if I am wrong.. but if you grab the top
&gt;of the front tire and do the push-pull thing isnt
&gt;there supposed to be a little play? I was lead to
&gt;understand that no play at all indicated that it was
&gt;to tight. hhmmm
