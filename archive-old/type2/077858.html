Subject: Re: [T2] Cops &amp; Buses


It depends a lot on what area you're in, really. Buses are common in Salt 
Lake - as compared to anywhere else I've been, anyway. I've never been 
pulled over in mine. I've also never been pulled over in it anywhere in the 
shoreline area of CT, where I used to live, nor anywhere on i-95 between New 
Haven and Fredericton, New Brunswick. On the other hand, I've been pulled 
over dozens of times in Saabs and once in a borrowed cherry red Grand Am - 
and I've only driven that twice, total under two hours! One nice thing about 
these old crates - it's darn hard to be pulled over for speeding!

On the other hand, I've nearly been arrested for loitering on a park bench. 
Apparently the cop didn't appreciate being asked &quot;why is the bench here if 
it can't be sat upon?&quot;...

So, it really depends almost completely on where you are, not what you 
drive. The drug kids where I grew up drove Camaros and Firebirds, so those 
were the profiled cars. Southerners don't take well to us long-haired 
hippies (whether we have long hair or not), and small town cops are ready to 
pick on /anything/ with out-of-state plates.

It helps to keep your bus looking nice. I bet a rust heap bus will be pulled 
over ten times as often as a show-quality bus.
