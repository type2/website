Subject: Low Oil Pressure on Rebuild

I just made some measurements on my recent 1980
Westfalia engine rebuild.  It's a 2L CV block with
hydraulic lifters, and a Muelling high volume oil
pump. I wasn't too happy with the results, although
the van seems to run good.  I'm beginning to think
reasonable hot idle oil pressures must be extremely
rare.  Here's what I found out:

1. Hot idle is 10 psi with AC off, and 7 psi when AC
on (Ac just lowers idle speed).  It takes 15 to 30
minutes running at 55 mph to see these low pressures. 
When first started cold the pressure is 70 psi.  I
talked with Boston Bob who was totally unconcerned
about 7 psi.  I also talked with Mofoco who said 7 psi
 is what their rebuilders typically see, and 3 psi is
where you worry about damage.  I would have thought 20
to 30 psi at hot idle would be a lot more reasonable.

2. At 55 mph I usually get 36 psi, which isn't too
bad.  However, I would have thought 50 0r 60 would
have been more reasonable.

3. My new VDO gage is off, making the pressures seem
worse than they are.  At 10 psi I only had 4 psi on
the VDO).  I calibrated my VDO with regulated air
pressure against two other pressure gages.  With VDO
when you ground out the sensor lead the meter should
read zero.  Mine reads -4 psi, so the problem appears
to be the meter, not the sender.  Also, when you open
the sensor lead the meter is supposed to peg off
scale.

4. The original VW pressure switch doesn't close until
4,5 psi (this is consistant with what Mofoco said
about damage at 3 psi).  I never see the idiot light
come on when using this switch.

5. The VDO pressure switch (I have the dual sender)
closes at 10.5 psi.  If I used this switch I would
have the idiot light on all the time when the AC is on
at hot idle.  Why did VDO place the threshold at 10.5
when VW placed it at 4.5? 

6. Compression after about 3K miles is low but uniform
at 95 to 105 psi.  I would have thought 135 would have
been a lot better.  I'm not sure how much power or gas
mileage I lose at 100 vrs 135, anybody ever figure
this out?

7. Best gas mileage (manual trans) is 19.4 on flat
land.  Not too bad, but I used to get as much as 23
with the old engine that was leaking oil out of every
seam.

The engine's still under warranty, but I don't want to
be unreasonable.  I can't find any rebuilders who'll
promise higher oil pressures and compression.  GEX
said they would quote a figure when they received
their Bentley manuals for the vanagon, which
apparently they were out of (how scientific is that?).
 I think Mark Stephens spec'd pressures, but I'm
beginning to think he took that secret with him when
he closed shop.  What other good rebuilders are ther
other than GEX, Boston Engines, and maybe Mofoco?

Also, it could be my rebuild (done by a mechanic with
over 20 years experience) was done for longevity
rather than performance.  What do you guys think? 
Does it make much difference if you only have 7 to 10
psi at hot idle with a new rebuild?  I've heard
stories of owners driving for many tens of thousands
of miles with the oil light flickering at hot idle. 
Should I just chuck that VDO and keep truckin?  Am I
losing much performance or gas mileage at 100 vrs 135
psi compression?
