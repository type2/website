&gt; 1. One of the exhaust studs is missing. Local VW FLAPS told me it's an 8x9mm
&gt;    stud. He doesn't stock them. I pulled one from a spare 1.8l that I have
&gt;    and it's 8x8mm, but when I put it in the head it's loose. Would that be
&gt;    because the hole is stripped or did some heads really come with 8x9mm
&gt;    studs and others 8x8mm? I need to get a new stud ASAP (I'm not going to
&gt;    put the engine back together until I have it) and I need to know whether
&gt;    I'll be tapping out a 9mm hole or not. If so, is this something I can do
&gt;    with the head still bolted on (is it a blind hole or will I have to worry
&gt;    about bits of metal getting in the cylinder?)

Steve,

The original spec was an 8x8 stud, as you have found.  The VW-supplied
repair for pulled studs was the 8x9 stepped stud and I have seen a *lot*
of them.  If you still have an 8mm hole, then I would say &quot;thank you&quot; and
head down to a *good* hardware store and buy an 8x8 stud (way easier to
find than the stepped stud in the real world) and install it.
