Subject: [T2] Insulation on and off the road

We use Wool (from sheep) insulation, same configuration as fibreglass but
without the health disadvantages, only costs 12% more. Smells wonderful,
great to sleep under and the kids can roll around in it too. Probably goes
soggy when wet, never tried that though !
