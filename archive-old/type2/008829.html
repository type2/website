To holli and perplexed listees:
Well, I have a 78 and an IQ of ... and from memory, the routine for #2 plug
goes like this :*)

You have to REMOVE the air cleaner/air sensor to reach the plug.   This
involves (1) loosening the phillips screw to the hose clamp left of the
silver box with the black top which is the air sensor. (2) pull off the
wire plug to the air sensor (it faces FRONT) (3) pull off any rubber hoses
entering the air cleaner. (4) Remove the large hose connecting the aux. air
blower down to the heater box below. (5) unclip the the wire clip UNDER the
air cleaner and push the air cleaner up to clear a hole in its platform,
then pull out to clear a hole in the rear....pull it towards you and left.
    Now if you remove the upper engine cover and climb in the back of the
bus and shine your light down where you yanked the plug wire, you should
see the plug.  72 bus owners can use a mirror.  Get a 6-10&quot; extension that
LOCKS to the socket (Sears; when you lose the lock they'll replace it
forever) and make sure the gripping ring of foam/rubber is in the socket-
it should hold a loose plug- test it!!!!  Slip this into the hole at about
the angle you saw the plug and feel it over the plug.  MEMORIZE the right
angle by using an extra long estension that goes nearly to the ceiling of
the compartment and MARKING where it hits the ceiling!!  Roughly, it points
right and rear of the actual hole in the tin.  This makes reinstalling
later much easier, since you will be hand twirling the extension to start
the plug in again!
Push the ratchet onto the expension and GET A GRIP on the handle as you
hold the socket end of the extension with the other hand.  The plug should
unscrew.  Reinstall by using antizieze compound (comes in little tube or
tub) rubbed around the threads with your fingertip.  DO NOT use the ratchet
initially- feel that you have started the plug by twirling the extension at
the right angle until you feel the plug threading in without binding.  Then
comes the fun of feeling on that plug wire end!
