Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy


&gt;Because if played at the intended volume in an urban setting it subjects
&gt;everyone within 50 yards of the vehicle to the musical tastes of the
&gt;stereo owner.

Been there done that. Lived on a busy corner in town, bunches of folks 
thought nothing of sharing their music at 2 AM. Apparently nobody sleeps at 
2 AM... &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;I've installed quite a few stereos as well, and I've gone through the &quot;big
&gt;amp&quot; phase of life myself.  Now I realize how inconsiderate I was of those
&gt;around me, and I was only playing with 50W per channel or so, not the
&gt;kilowatt that is the current norm.  Face it, when some yahoo comes up at
&gt;a light with his stereo thumping away it is annoying, not impressive, to
&gt;the majority of the people forced to listen to it.

Agreed.

Harley's and dualled out large pickups - gas and diesel. Sport bikes, etc.

There is a time and place.

I recommend investing in the hearing aid companies because there is a whole 
generation that will need them in a few decades.
