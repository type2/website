Subject: Re: [T2] Electric VS mechanical fuel pump


Whats wrong with the fuel pump that is on the engine now? Are you having
problems with it? If so why dont you replace it now? If not, why are you so
worried about it? If you are worried about things failing I would take it to
a mechanic and have him check your WHOLE bus over before you head out on
your trip.




&gt; I have a simple question; I have a mechanical fuel pump on my 1700cc
 (73'), as I said before I am preparing a long trip to Mexico and the
 southern USA next February.
 So I wonder about this pump being reliable, for sure I will try to buy a
 spare one (I think Busdepot sells one?) I also have in my spare parts
 what seem to be an electric metal fuel pump (wall mounted).

 Question one:
 Can I buy a rebuilt kit for the mechanical one or should I buy a spare
 one or both.

 Question two:
 If I use the electric one (mine or the one sold by various parts
 dealers), what is regulating the pressure of this one? (my Vanagon had
 a fuel pressure regulator, do I have to add one if I use a electric
 pump?)
 Many thanks, Ben from Montreal, Canada&lt;
