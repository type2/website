Subject: mystery fuel injection ECU

I bought (cheap) a Bosch fuel injection Electronic Control Unit at the 
Litchfield VW show flea market today,  and I am trying to identify it. 
It has a green sticker on its side which lists two part numbers. One is 
a VW number: 043 906 021. The other number is: 0 280 000 105 (I am 
guessing this is a Bosch number).  These numbers don't correspond to 
the numbers listed in Bentley. However, it looks like a bus ECU.

Is this a Bus ECU? I bought it hoping I can keep it as a spare for 
either my '78 or my '79.

Thanks.

P.S.  The Litchfield show was very nice today. What a beautiful day. 
Quite a number of transporters were on hand.
