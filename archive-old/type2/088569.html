Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms

&gt;  Second,
&gt; the tubes rust out, usually at the flanges.  Again, noisy but not
&gt; dangerous.

The tubes will never rust out. They are non-magnetic stainless steel. As are
the afterburner U pipes.
Yes, the flanges themselves will rust away.
Biggest problem with the tubes is vibration from lack of support. Heat makes
the tubes very brittle and a shoke will crack them. Usually always the right
side, just past #2 joint.
