Subject: Re: Reliability - my two cents worth (longish)

I
&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; But to state the locus of disagreement, it is this: human 
relationships 
  are 
   complex and unpredictable systems. Volkswagens, by comparison, are 
   simplicity itself.

  If you are a hardliner VW nut, please delete this and move on.
  Now as much as I like Volkswagens, and I do, I just could not recommend one 
  to a guy as an only means of transportation unless it has been COMPLETELY 
  disassembled and rebuilt replacing all questionable components, which would 
  be very pricey.  As it is, the newest busses are twenty years old, and as 
  such they are subject to failures at a higher rate of both frequency and 
  severity (in general).
  I would drive my wife's Cherokee the seven hours to the Bug Out with only a 
  passing thought to spares.  I know that it is certainly possible for this 
  Jeep to break, but experience has shown me that it is more reliable than a 
  VW.  
  Now don't get me wrong - I love my VWs, but a trip in the Jeep is a trip.  
A 
  trip In a VW is an adventure. (or at least a potential adventure).  I've 
  never had to change a stripped Jeep drive part in a restaurant in 
 Winchester, 
  VA, or put out an engine fire and then rob wires and hoses from other parts 
  of the car to get back on the road. 
  The Jeep is just newer and less prone to failure of worn parts or corroded 
  terminals. 
  Is a '73 VW as reliable as a '73 Ford?  Probably.  Both are the same age.
  VWs were (are) well designed and built machines, but age and misuse take 
  their toll.
  On the other hand, VWs are easy and relatively inexpensive to repair, parts 
  are still pretty easy to come by, they enjoy a devoted following, and VW 
  folks are the best I've ever seen to help out in a jam (witness this list 
 and 
  the Type 2 site, a fantastic resource).
  And like the other fellow said, how many people look out into the driveway 
  and says  &quot; Man, I'm gonna keep that Pinto forever!&quot; (paraphrased)
  Still and all, if a fellow new to VWs were to come up to me and ask if I 
  thought that a '78 bus, even a well maintained, low mileage one, would be 
  reliable enough for him and his wife and small kids to use as an only means 
  of transportation through the cold winter I would hang my head and mutter 
  &quot;No.&quot;
  Just my unsolicited opinion.  Take it for what it is worth.
