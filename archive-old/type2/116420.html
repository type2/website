&gt; So now I'm back to hunting vacuum leaks, I guess.  All of the small 
&gt; hoses are new (except for throttle body hose, but that hose looked 
&gt; quite new already), so I guess I'm down to:
&gt;
&gt; 	- Decel valve vacuum hoses
&gt; 	- Brake booster vacuum hose
&gt; 	- Boot between AFM and throttle body

Well, I think I found it.  See the series of photos and descriptive 
text at:

     
http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/pod/liveframe.cgi/throttle-boot-leak

The nipple in question is the one below the Y-fitting that connects the 
decel valve to the throttle boot.  The hose is saturated with stinky 
oil.  Is that the oil breather that the other end of the hose connects 
to?

Anyway, as you can also see in the photos, the boot has a lot of oil on 
it.  I think I'm going to pull it off completely, give it a thorough 
cleaning, and use some Ultra Black to re-seal the fittings into the 
boot.  I'm also going to replace that hose.

I guess I should be careful, following Sage Green's post about a leaky 
(and NLA) gasket between the throttle body and the air plenum.  Would I 
be well advised to go ahead and pull the throttle while I have the rest 
of this apart and make sure it's sealed up as well?
