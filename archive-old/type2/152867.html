&gt; What about the problem of the 28 (or so) coolant
&gt; hoses costing around $1000 to replace every few
&gt; years?  

Hey Ray  What this about I have had 3 vanagons  my sycro has over 300K on it 
and came out of OHIO where they use liquid salt  the brake lines rusted thur 
but have had no problems with the water lines or any water leaks.  My first one 
I just sold cause I got myself a 85 westy but it had over 150K and no water 
leaks,   I havent seen a single pipe other that the H pipe in the 1.9L go bad , 
 Same goes for the trannies,    Maybe I am just lucky or maybe you aren&quot;t     
I personally like the earlier ones with the 1.9 cause I dont like the way the 
computor controls everything on the later vanagons.   I also have been using 
standard  antifrezze  you know that green stuff.  After 40 years of camping in 
splitties the vanagon is a whole lot better to drive long distances in and a 
lot safer traveling at interstate speeds.   To each his own  later  Mark 
Dearing
