&gt; Seems as though I am frequently removing my tires from their rims.
&gt; Sometimes to paint the rims; sometimes to install port-a-walls.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to have the ability to do this in the garage instead of
&gt; trusting the job to a local service station.
&gt; 
&gt; In the Northern catalog are listed three gadgets for doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone used one of these home remedies?  Do they work? Do they
injure
&gt; the seal or the rim?

There's no trick to dismounting a tire.  The hardest part is getting
the bead broken from the rim.  For this I use the bus jack and a 3
foot length of 2X4.

First, if you are planning to remount the tire, mark the tire next to
the valve stem so that you can remount the tire in the same
orientation near the rim.

Take the air out of the tire and lay the tire next to the bus under
the rear jack point.  Lay the 2x4 on top of the tire with the free end
extending under the bus and the end on top of the tire even with the
edge of the rim nearest the bus.  The idea is that you want to push
down as close to the bead as possible.

Next, put your jack on the jack point and push down on the 2X4 as
close to the bead end as possible.  The bead should dismount fairly
easily.  Repeat the process on the other side.

Now you need to dismount the rim.  You can buy tire irons at some
FLAPS, but I got mine at a motorcycle shop.  Get a set of three that
are at least a foot long, 18 inches is better.  Lay the tire on its
side, push one side of the bead into the &quot;valley&quot; of the rim, and use
the hooked end of the tire iron to pull the bead over the edge of the
rim.  Using the other tire iron, work the bead around the rim until
the bead is on top of the rim.  Repeat the process to get the other
bead off.

To reinstall, reverse the above :).  Well, you use the straight end of
the tire irons to put the tire on, then you have to inflate the tire
to seat the beads.  Lay the tire flat, and never let your head or body
get over the tire or rim while inflating the tire.  Figure that you
have 30 pounds of pressure on every square inch of that tire, so if
something lets go the rim is going somewhere (usually up) in a _big_
hurry!  I use WD-40 to lubricate the beads while seating them. 
Obviously an air compressor is a good thing to have to seat the beads!
