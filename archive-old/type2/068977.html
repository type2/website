Subject: Re: Tool FAQ [F]

Top ten tools you don't find in best-buy assortments:

1. Blocks of wood. I like squares of 2 x 6&quot;. Keep at least a dozen where
you can get at them. Some are beveled on one edge to serve as primitive
chocks (that's what I use the hatchet for). There is nothing you can't lift
as high as you please with a bottle jack and a bunch of blocks.

2. Razor blades.

3. Punches, assorted sizes between shear pin and full-fledged drift.

4. Vise Grips, large, strong, what they lack in elegance they make up for
in intimidation.

5. Vise. Also vice. Read that however you like. ;)

6. Flashlight. Not some little keychain trinket, I mean a real flashlight
and batteries in it, too.

5. Crank. I don't know the name of this thing, in essence it's a 1/2&quot;
socket drive but it's shaped like a crank. They may not even sell these
anymore. Extremely useful for torqueing fasteners spread out over a flat
surface and spinning nuts onto crudded-up studs.

6. BFS. A screwdriver of surpassing size.

7. Three-pound sledge.

8. JB Weld.

9. Six-foot water pipe.

10. Duct tape, duct tape, duct tape!
