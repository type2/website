Subject: Looking for ignition switch contact for 78 westy

Hey Everyone,
It's getting more and more difficult to start the car (78 westy), so I'm 
thinking that the plastic electric switch that hooks onto the bottom of 
the keyed ignition switch is probably cracked and slowly dying.  Does 
anyone know the part number for this part?  They have a few on BD, but I 
just want to confirm that I'm getting the right one.

Thanks!
Mike
