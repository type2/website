Subject: BusDepot rubber seat pedestal mats

Someone posted recently asking about installation of these but I lost the
message. On the inner wrap around mat, I used 3M Super Trim Adhesive spray
part# 08090 and it worked well. I installed the outer mat without any adhesive
and so far it doesn't seem to want to come out. On both pieces, there is a
portion on the top that folds over and slides into a recess in the pedestal. I
found that I had to trim these about 1/16&quot; or so with a utility knife to keep
them from bottoming out in the slot.

On the inner mat, it is easier if you *don't* apply adhesive to all 3 sides at
once as it is virtually impossible to get it all positioned properly this way
(ask me how I know!). What worked better was to wrap the entire mat around the
pedestal without adhesive and fold the above mentioned portion over into the
slot. When everything is positioned the way you want it, have someone on the
opposite side of the car hold their fingers firmly over this section to keep
the rubber from coming out of the slot. Then lift the mat up from the bottom
so that you can spray the adhesive and just glue the section toward the center
of the car at this time. When this is dry, then go back and glue the front and
rear sections.

Good luck,
