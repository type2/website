&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any tips for removing the input pilot shaft seal on the
&gt; transmission while the shaft and the bellhousing are installed?

You need a seal puller. You can make one with a piece of hard steel wire
1/8&quot; dia. with a tiny hook on the end. Then fashion a tee handle from 1&quot; or
so dowel so you can pull hard on the hook. The hook on the end should look
like the business end of a crochet hook - smooth in one direction and have a
barb in the other. You can then force this into the space between the shaft
and the seal and slowly work you way around the seal. The case in magnesium
and will dent easily, so be careful.

I believe there are purpose built tools for this kind of job also, but I
made the tool described above and it works.
