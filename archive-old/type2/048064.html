Subject: [T2] cast iron &quot;filling material&quot; of choice?

Friends,
I'm going over a newly acquired VW, not an air-cooled van but rather a '91 
Jetta, watercooled 1.8L. Here's my problem, at the junction of a water 
outlet from the block and a water manifold made of bakelite or some other 
plastic, I have a very slight coolant leak. The seal between the parts is 
done by a rubber O-ring held in a groove on the bakelite side of the 
junction. The leak I now see, after replacing to O-ring, is due to there 
being a very slight depression in the otherwise flat face on the mating 
surface of the block, right at the O-ring seal location. It is about 1/8 
inch in length and maybe 1/32 inch deep, just enough that the O-ring won't 
quite seal the depressed area under pressure during operation (its dry when 
cold). My question, how can I either fill the depression, or otherwise apply 
some sealing compound (which?) to the O-ring and block surface that would 
effectively complete the seal. It is not a signigicant leak at all (more 
like a sweating), but over time and unexpectedly it might get worse to the 
point of causing trouble. What compound could I press into the depression 
and then file flat, or perhaps a form-a-gasket compund I could apply to the 
joint at time of reassembly that would be compatible with rubber and iron 
and withstand coolant? Any suggestions would be welcomed.
Roland - '75 Westy and '91 Jetta (in the &quot;family&quot;)
