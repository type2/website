Subject: Re: Bucking

&gt;&gt;I'll be going along and then suddenly its like my car loses power for a
couple of seconds or like its running out of gas.  the tachometer skips all
over the place and then if I push in the clutch and then let it out again it
seems to stop.  It almost always happens when I have just shifted into a
gear.  Is this a fuel injection problem, a coil problem, fuel pump, or
distributor problem?  or something else?&lt;&lt;

Drew,
Your symptoms pretty much match those that I had a few years ago that turned
out to be gunk (rusty internal pieces, most likely) in my fuel tank clogging
the outlets where fuel exits the tank.  I was advised to remove the tank and
either replace it or clean it out.  My second option was to try and not let
the fuel level get below half-empty in hopes of the particles not getting
low enough to clog the outlets again.  Although sometimes a PITA, that 2nd
approach has worked for me ever since.
