 &gt;
 &gt;Which cars and trucks and vans share the same wheel bolt patterns with the
 &gt;later model Baywindow busses?


You can get any wheel you want for any car.  The question is, do you feel 
like paying for it?  When I was looking for rims for my convertible bug.. I 
wanted flashy and good looking.  The rims I wanted were only made for newer 
cars, mostly American models.  I spoke with the guys at the rim company, 
and they suggested either have custom rims made (about $2000 for the set) 
or the other idea we talked through was possibly buying &quot;Blank&quot; drums and 
rotors.  Blank drums and rotors are basically where you buy them before 
they are drilled for any particular bolt pattern.  Once you find the rims 
you want, take the blanks to a competent machine shop that can and will 
drill them to the bolt pattern of the rim selected.  This is also a way to 
get brake parts less expensive...

Essentially what I have found is that nobody really makes any thing for the 
small 5 bolt pattern of new bay window busses.


Unbeatable performance?
