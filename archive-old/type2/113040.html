Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia goes thru tree

well someone always needs another opinion. i have had the bra on zapper since 1988. 
i never take it off it took
there were no signs of abrasion or wear till about 7 years into it. and it was just 
around the top edge and under the tire. now i also have little varicose rust veins 
but my vinyl has not faded and my bus looks a lot better with her bra than with out.
;-)
i believe if you wax the car and normally let the underside dry out by loosening the 
edges it should work great.  btw richard it looks like a great color match!!  great job.

&gt; You may want to rethink the whole water test thing with the bra on
&gt; if you can avoid it.  I have several friends in various states of
&gt; duress due to leaving their bra's on their vehicles during the rainy
&gt; season.  Water tends to make them cling to the vehicle and any road
&gt; dust that got under the bra turns into an abrasive at that point and
&gt; will damage the paint.  I went to a body shop guy I know and his
&gt; opinion was that a bra should be used primarily in a dry climate.
&gt; Although often there is no way to keep it dry when the rain catches
&gt; you while on the road.  Anybody else on this list have any
&gt; experiences with bra's of the vehicle variety damaging paint?
