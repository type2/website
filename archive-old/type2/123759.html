Subject: RE: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd prefer the 50/50 windows myself to these louvered ones. But I
live in SoCal so cooling is more necessary than rain resistance.&lt;&lt;

Yeah,I prefer the 50/50 too to the louvered ones. I just don't like the
visibility of the Louvered. Even though I live in Seattle and it rains
TONS. I'd much rather just deal with not having open back windows during
the rainy season(s).  I got a thing for letting the light in, what
little light there is. I write this as it pours down rain outside my
window. It's the middle of July, and it's cold and raining. :(  Bah,
hope it gets sunny later on. 

Hey hey, Cap'N Nemo! Methinks you may be getting some 'chip' poisoning.
Maybe ya' oughta lay off 'em a bit. Lol  ::teases mercilesly::

P.S. Don't feel bad guys, that electrical mess I posted is a toughie.
I'll have to go out their with a LONG continuity tester or something and
figure it all out methinks.
