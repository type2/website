Subject: [T2] murder information web site for Kristin...  www.yourvw_dot_com/Kristi 	n/

Site for info:

  http://www.yourvw_dot_com/Kristin/

sorry that the site has had a few problems today, all fixed.

I just put up the Obituary Link... looks like the funeral is Saturday?

I have not received any info on official list flowers or collection, if
there info, please email me and I will put it on the web site.

P.S.  The List Archives are being updated as we speak, should be online by
noon Saturday.
