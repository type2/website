it would be to remove the heads with the engine still bolted up. Looks like
lots'o'room to me!


Realized I didn't have a cylinder hone. Pep Boys run. Picked up a set of
strap wrenches too. You know the ones Bob Vila pitches for Craftsman? Worked
OUTSTANDING on the pushrod tubes!

Troy pulled the heads. Easier to lower them down than pull them up. Cool.
Pulled the cylinders off as well.
