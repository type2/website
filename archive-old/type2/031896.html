Chris:

The pilot bearing is a press fit into the flywheel.  There's no need to 
remove the flywheel to refit the pilot bearing.

The pilot bearing is most easily removed with an appropriate sized 
puller, though there are other methods that also work.  The new pilot 
bearing (a $2 or $3 part) is then &quot;pressed&quot; into place.  The word 
&quot;pressed&quot; is in quotes because everybody uses a socket of the appropriate 
size and then gently tap, tap, taps the bearing into place.

&gt; Engine is out. Subject is a 1972 1.7 liter CB engien code. Removal of clutch
&gt; brought out some needles from the pilot bearing. A review of Bentley
&gt; suggests that the pilot bearing is pressed into flywheel hub. Flywheel is
&gt; removed by the loosening of the 5 bolts holding it to the crankshaft.
&gt; However there does not seem to be a clear procedure for replaceing the pilot
&gt; bearing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bus Depot lists part#111 105 313A as &quot;pilot shaft needle bearing '72-83
&gt; bus/vanogon.&quot; Is this the only part necessary. Is it as simple as removing
&gt; the flywheel, inserting the bearing from the rear of flywheel and
&gt; reinstalling?
