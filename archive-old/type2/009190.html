&gt;Here is how to solve the question:  How many list members have successfully
&gt;used the coil-over shocks, and how many have experienced unsuccessful
&gt;outcomes?  Only those with actual first-hand experience should respond.

I originally posted to the list about the Napa shocks. I had used them for 2 
years on my Westy before posting. I have over 49,000 trouble free miles on 
them, so far. I do a lot of off-road driving and camping as I look for that 
elusive yellow stuff [AU=gold fever].
