Subject: Ext Oil Cooler
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Recently bought a $400 camper, a 74 with a rebuilt 77 eng, and it has a
large ext cooler, made by RVEECO. Don't believe such is neccessary, but the
bus had lived in Mexico for awhile. Go on lots of VW campouts here in
western NC, and it seems to run about 15-20 degrees cooler than friends on
the average (if there is such a think among 20-30 year old vehicles. )  BTW,
the feed lines run under the bus, thermostated to open at 180 degrees and
the very top I've seen running all day here in the mountains, is 230 Degrees
up long/steep grades. Not saying this is necessarily good...just what is.

I wouldn't have put on in, but starting to change my mind about pulling it
out as originally planned. Regards, Marv Krupp, from 0 busses to 3 in 18
months.
