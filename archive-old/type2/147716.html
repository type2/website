&gt; Sounds like your battery is shagged! If I understand things  
&gt; correctly, the alternator light comes on when there is a voltage  
&gt; differential between the alternator and the battery ie either of  
&gt; them is at a lower voltage than the other. Sounds like the battery  
&gt; voltage is low (slow cranking) and the alternator works (light goes  
&gt; off and you can drive long distances) - though I would be concerned  
&gt; about how long it takes the light to go out.

I would test DF (green wire) at the voltage regulator against ground.  
If there is little to no voltage (vs. ~5V) when the alt warning light  
is on then I would guess it's an alternator/VR problem rather than a  
battery problem.
