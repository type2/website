Subject: need stock 1971 vacum advance unit to pass smog - CA

        Well it's that time of the year and the state wants me to give
        them more money - SMOG CHECK.....

        The Bus passed 2 years ago with a 60k engine, but since then, a
        long block replacement due to distributor vacum unit failure
        (burnt 3td piston)

        Been running a 009 since the rebuilt without a single problem
        (28 degrees total advance, 180-210 oil temp), but everyone says
        I will not pass the visual part without the stock dist.

        ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!

        All the local shops want _at_ 80-100$ for the bosch unit + 30 for
        the test and 7$ for the certificate - COME ON!!! my tags are
        only 50$.

        Anyone near Fresno, CA. have a unit they can spare for
        a resonable price?

        Or loan me one so I can do the smog &quot;thang&quot;

        PLEASE....... only have till mid Sept. to take care of this.

        (and they want 15$ to non-op a car now too? can you spell
         G-R-E-E-D-Y, I knew that you could)

        Actually I'm up 41 in Oakhurst, near Yosemite. I would be
        willing to swap a place to stay/campout (the folks have 7
        acres), a beer and a shower for some fellow Bussers traveling
        to/from the park?

        Any takers? &quot;CCC&quot; people?
