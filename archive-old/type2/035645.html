Subject: Looking to trade a 77 bay (no engine)

About a month an a half ago I bought a 77 bay with no engine and no
bench seats.  It has the tranny, and AC.  I don't know if either work
but I was told by the guy I bought it from that the tranny works.  The
previous owner lives around the corner but I don't know him well since
I've just moved into this neighborhood.  The body has no dents and no
rust holes, but some surface rust.  I have the
rear bumper but it's detached.  I have a couple pics is someone would
like to see them 
 &lt;http://home.inreach_dot_com/george70/bus.html&gt;

 I picked this up without really thinking it over and now that I have
it's not what I want.  I don't want to deal with getting it smogged if I
ever get an engine.  The less I have to deal with the bureaucracy the
better.

 I'd like to trade it for a tranny for my '70 Westy.  Does anyone near
Patterson, CA have working used tranny that they'd be willing to trade.
