Subject: New Plugs =?iso-8859-1?q?=3D?=
  =?iso-8859-1?q?_Backfire=3F=3F=3F?=

OK, I've got a stumper...1600 single port, 009 (I know, I know), 30/31
carb. I just adjusted my valves (only about 3 or 4, the rest were     
fine), changed my oil, and put in new Bosch w8ac plugs. Engine still  
runs fine, but seems like it takes a little longer to warm up, and the
kicker is that it now backfires at idle. Not a whole lot, and not     
really loud ones, just little pops, which seem to go away as soon as I
up the RPM's...                                                       
Any thoughts? Ideas?                                                  
Thanks,
