&gt;From: Courtney Hook &lt;courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca&gt;
&gt;My 1200cc standard VW has just decided the other day to sit and idle fine,
&gt;but will hesitate, pop through the carb on occasion, and stumble if you give
&gt;it any gas under load. It does better while sitting still, but under load
&gt;will display all the above symptoms. I can barely get it up a hill in 3rd,
&gt;have to go back to 2nd to get the revs up and stumble, jerk, cut out up the

This is EXACTLY the same symptoms that I had. Ran fine at idle but would 
buck and choke under load, especially after it got warmed up. Pull the 
capacitor (just disconnect the wire) and see if that makes it better.
