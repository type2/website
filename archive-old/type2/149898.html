Subject: Re: [T2] Power Brake Conversion

I am doing a power disc brake conversion on my 68 DC. Where do I hook up the
positive vacuum pressure line
from the engine that routs to the booster assembly?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am sure you mean the vacuum UNDERpressure line?

Yes of course... :)

It needs to connect to your intake manifold. What heads, carb(s), and intake
are you running?

Redline/Weber IDF Multiport fuel injection, MOFOCO 044 Heads.
How much negative pressure do I need to make the booster work? The IDF
Throttle bodies already have a vacuum system, but if I tap into it, won9t it
screw up the MAP sensor by drawing off too much vacuum?
