Subject: part request

Hello everyone,
I am in need of a lock cylinder. And I need it cheap.  I don't actually need 
the whole thing, just the tailpiece, so I don't care what kind of condition 
the rest of it is in. And it doesn't matter if it is from a bus, beetle, 
vanagon. As long as it is from a 71 or later it will work.
If anyone has an old cylinder or just the tailpiece please let me know. I'm 
going through withdrawl. It has been weeks since I have driven a bus.
Thanks,
Kyle
