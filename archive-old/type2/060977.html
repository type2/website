A winner if you want to drive around on undersized, undercapacity tires.
The capacity of this size and load rating is 1435 pounds, well below
the capacity the bus requires and even lower than the much-maligned
standard load 185R14!

For $20 more I bought a set of Bridgestones in 185R14 load range D
from an ordinary (at least in the US) Firestone store.  These tires
have over 400 pounds more capacity and aren't blemished.  They are
taller, so the engine runs 4% slower at any given speed.  They are
less likely to shed their tread and trash the battery or (gasp) gas
heater.

With correct-sized tires available at reasonable prices from
Bridgestone, Yokohama, Cooper, Hercules, etc., why do folks still put
the wrong tires on their buses?  Are the tire salesmen really that
persuasive?
