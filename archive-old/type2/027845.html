Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden Loud Clatter, and then a Dead Engine...

Thanks for all the advice so far... I have expectations of the worst but 
will keep my fingers crossed till it's confirmed (and will post back to the 
list when I know).  Guess it serves me right for getting seduced by this 
relatively rust-free beauty (which also happened to be relatively 
history-less).   In the meantime, anyone know of a good re-builder in New 
England (SE COnnecticut or thereabouts) since this repair may be beyond my 
abilities (though my finances may force me to learn fast)??

&gt;
&gt;Good advice from all. My 75 did a similar thing before I bought it. The po
&gt;description sounded much the same. If the engine has not turned since it
&gt;stopped, I would suggest you pull the valve covers as recommended but also 
&gt;pull
&gt;the spark plugs and take a look as best you can. While inspecting the dead
&gt;engine in my van before I bought it, the valve train looked ok under the 
&gt;valve
&gt;covers. Looking inside cylinder #3 I saw what looked like brass instead of 
&gt;steel
&gt;or aluminum. A likely indication of a dropped valve guide. You can't see 
&gt;much
&gt;but what you do see might tell the whole story.
&gt;
&gt;Be sure to follow Bobs advice about turning it by hand after looking 
&gt;inside.
&gt;Don't force it. In my case I found a piece of valve guide about an inch and 
&gt;a
&gt;half long inside the cylinder. Any force on the crank when turning by hand 
&gt;could
&gt;have made a bad situation worse.
&gt;
&gt;Hoping your repairs are cheap simple and effective!

&gt; &gt; I bought my 75 bus (1.8L FI) at the beginning of the summer and have put
&gt; &gt; about 2500 miles on it so far with not more than a few hiccups as I've 
&gt;been
&gt; &gt; learning the ropes.
