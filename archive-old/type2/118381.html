Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator or regulator or something else

You didn't mention if you had to jump start the bus or charge the battery,
but you should check the battery first.  A really bad battery might have an
internal short that could drag down the rest of the system. disconnect it
(both wires) and check the voltage (ideally about 12.5V) If it's low, try
charging it with an external charger for a few hours, then check again. Also
check the battery fluid level (unless your unit is sealed).

If that's ok, check the all connections, then the alternator &amp; VR; one of
them is likely to be the culprit (make sure your alternator belt is not
loose enough to slip under load). You didn't say if the alternator light
comes on; it might be burned out. Does it come on prior to engine start with
the key on (it should)?

Low electrical system voltage could decrease the ability of the ignition
system to make spark, causing performance trouble.

battery runs down
brake warning light is dimly illuminated when the headlights are on (there
is a connection to the voltage regulator, according to the wiring diagram).

maybe related:

occasionally, near total loss of power (originally, I thought this was
ignition related and have replaced every ignition components and have
installed a pertronix system.  I now think it is electrically or fuel
related - maybe a intermittent fuel blockage).
