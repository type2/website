Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem - Fixed

&gt;From: &quot;John Baird&quot;

&gt;If I remember right...as I am rotating the ALT bolt -the Exhaust- opens
&gt;first I think, then intake in/out, then I have to rotate it another 3
&gt;inches... nothing seems to move during these last 3 inches or so.
&gt;John


Sounds like 180 off then.

Remember:

Intake open, piston is pulled down.Fuel/air comes in.
Intake closes, piston comes up(Compressed fuel Mixture, TDC, fire).
Piston is pushed down.
Exhaust Valve opens, piston is pushed up. Exhaust releases.

Good luck,
