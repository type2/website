I have a tiny 'pinch type' flashlight on a chain, attached to the inside of 
my engine hatch.

In just a year, I must have used it 20 times to read the oil on my dipstick, 
but more so to find the hole to slip the dip stick back into.

And I even painted the dip stick 'keeper' tube a fluorescent green!!
