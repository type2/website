Hi Joe.
I had the same symptoms a while back and it ended up being a bad coil.  They
recurred a couple weeks later and it ended up being a bad coil again.  The
tach was killing coils, but it took me a while to figure that out.  Got
tired of being stuck of the side of the road in the middle of nowhere and
once I took the tach off the coild the Burrito Express has been real happy.
