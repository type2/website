Subject: Re: [T2] Oil filler cap

Previously I wrote:

&gt; Is there supposed to be a sealing gasket between the oil filler tube and the
&gt; cap?

There IS supposed to be a seal and now that I have one I'm not getting
condensation foam in the oil filler tube anymore. I took off the hose going
from the s-boot to the oil breather and it was full of the same foam.  You
might want to give it a clean now and again.
