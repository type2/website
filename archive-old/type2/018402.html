&gt; But these questions aside, I've been wondering just how easy or

&gt; me of their direct experience doing so, if any.

     I've ordered stuff from Europe with no problems before, and I'm
seriously considering buying a trike from Russia. It's no different than
buying mailorder in the US. Actually, buying from net dealers is quite a bit
safer than buying from regular mail order places, because of the tremendous
potential you have to squawk loud and clear to the whole world. Somebody
rips you off, just start posting their name and address to all the pertinent
lists and newsgroups.
