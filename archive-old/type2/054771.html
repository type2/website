Subject: Re: Bus won't return to idle

Steve,
Make sure that your vacuum advance and retard is working correctly.  If
you have the distributor vacuum can with two ports, one is
advance(towards right side of engine) and the other one is
retard(towards left).  The retard is the one that comes from the top of
the engine case and goes into the left side of the can.  If that isn't
working correctly, or your breaker plate is frozen, I think that may add
to the problem.

Also, check your vacuum hoses, including your aux air/cold start/let
more air in valve (I forget what it's called).  If that is faulty, then
you may be getting air bypassing the throttle housing and going straight
into the intake manifold through that valve.  Bentley explains how to
check it.

Lastly, check the bosch efi manuals to see if they have any
troubleshooting guides to solve high idle...

Hope that helps,
MIke

&gt; &gt; Well, I flunked my first try at emissions today.  The problem is that it
&gt; &gt; will not return to idle on its own.  when you start it, it idles at ~900,

&gt; &gt; Oh, mighty list, is there anything else it might be?  anything I have not

&gt; I got by the same problem by tightening up the return spring, there above
&gt; the air box to the throttle lever (not the one in the accelerator linkage)
