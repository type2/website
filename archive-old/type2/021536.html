I got one that's even better...

I was driving on the freeway and all of a sudden I heard this rumbling
noise from rear passenger side.  So, I pulled over and it was a flat..
&quot;Shoot,&quot; I said, &quot;and I don't have a spare.. argh..&quot;

So, I walked down to the gas station and called AAA.  I went back to my
car and when the truck arrived I greeted the guy and I said, &quot;I don't
have a spare so what do you want to do because the back tire is totally
shredded.&quot;  He replied, &quot;what about the spare tire on the front of your
car&quot;

DOH!!!  Granted, I never had a bus with a tire on the front, but
shoooooot I was dull..

needless to say, I was slightly embarassed :)

&gt; Anyone wanna make me feel better, by admitting that they, too, have been
&gt; totally clueless about their bus at one time?
&gt; 
&gt; In a short trip today, the bus went from OK, to the point where I couldn't
&gt; get it into gear at the lights, EVENTUALLY, it got locked into reverse &amp; I
&gt; ended up calling roadside assistance, CERTAIN that I was up for a long tow &amp;
&gt; new transaxle. I got underneath, but was stumped by the plate covering the
&gt; gear selector (more later on this).
&gt; 
&gt; When the guy turned up, we rocked it out of gear in about 10 seconds, and he
&gt; followed me over to my house (I'd almost made it myself, just a few more
&gt; KM). His suggestion was that the clutch needed looking at (as well as the
&gt; gear selector that I was fixating on), which made sense when I FINALLY
&gt; stopped to think, as I could select gear with the engine off, but not with
&gt; the engine running, and the bus stalled when stopped in gear (clutch
&gt; dragging).
&gt; 
&gt; After trying to find the manual &amp; spare clutch cable in the van (show's how
&gt; long it's been since I've used them, but in my defence, I didn't get to use
&gt; her for about 18 months after a break-up), I asked my builder friend (who's
&gt; working on my house and has been a bus only driver for 30 odd years), where
&gt; the clutch adjustment was, he showed me where it was, put 4-5 turns on the
&gt; adjuster, and it was fine after that.
&gt; 
&gt; So, to stop me slashing my wrists and/or selling the bus to someone who DOES
&gt; have a clue, anyone else want to admit to having been this clueless at some
&gt; point in their bus ownership? Knowing that there's some chance of redemption
&gt; would be nice :o(
