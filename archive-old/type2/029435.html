Oh, my!  I had not meant to excite such interest.  Below are answers to
some of the comments posted so far:

Where did I get it?
Karl von Salzen posted a bit back that he had them, and I asked for one.  
I am leaving it to him to say if he has any left, and how much they would
be.  By all means, if he has any, take advantage!  I really don't need the
security where I live, but I love having all the bells and whistles :-)

Can I get it re-keyed to my current locks?
Yes, I am certain that you can.  It is likely to be pricy, unless you do
it yourself.  The process is fairly simple (Nikki even taught *me* to do
it :-), but the problem is that you have to get the cylinder out first.  
The cylinder is usually retained by a fairly fine roll pin on VW locks.
Sometimes the drilling for the pin goes all the way thru, sometimes it is
a &quot;blind&quot; drilling.  The drilling on the lock Karl sent me is of the
&quot;blind&quot; variety.  That is the pin is easy to press in, and I have no idea
how you would get it out!  Perhaps it could be drilled out with a fine
bit, but I would want a competent machinist to do this.  I sure ain't up
to it.  Alternatively, a hole could be drilled from the other side to
provide access for a punch to drive the pin out.  I dunno... I just put
mine in and added the key to may chain.

&gt; Mebbee time for a little rattlecan tidyup?  :)

Craig,

You are *spoiled*!  That counts as &quot;rust free&quot; here in the salt states :-)
The frame is straight and not rusted out.  The rest of it... eh... it
could be better.  At least, starting out orange, it has not changed color
any too much :-)
