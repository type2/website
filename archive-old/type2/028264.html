Subject: Can I block EGR ('77)
Message-ID: &lt;LBPCMCMFMEHLDAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Bottom line questions: Can I just plug the line coming up to the FI system from my EGR filter? Should I bail on FI and go to carburetion? 

Scenario follows:

I may have goofed. In my search for a balance between economy and longevity, it appears I'm trying to make a Frankenstein of an engine:

- '77 case w/FI
- earlier heads (1800) ...dude knew I was building a 2.0 liter FI engine, but on phone last night, describes the heads he's already sold me as (1800/2000 heads). I don't know what this means, but I'm guessing it's geared toward carburated engines?
- earlier exhaust ('72)

Now, in trying to figure out where I'm going to mount all my FI stuff inside the '72 bus (oh yeah, one more twist...I've never *seen* a FI engine installed), I find this section in Bentley on the EGR filter and valve and I'm thinking &quot;Hey, I don't have one of those. They're showing this thing hooking up to a '77-later exhaust. My '72 exhaust ain't made like that! Yikes!&quot;

So, where do I go from here? If I plug that EGR valve, I'll run rich, won't I? If I leave that thing sucking air, I'll run lean and probably damage the FI, right?

I'm wondering if I should just bail on the FI right now and install a carburetor (of course, I'll need a carburetor and manifold conversion if I do--something else I've never seen, but have heard about).

Any suggestions or offers to sell working carburation setups for a 2.0 engine would be appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
