Subject: WANTED: 091 4.86 or 5.43 (diesel) tranny/R&amp;P

Hey all,

I'm looking for a good lower ring and pinion, or entire transmission
at a reasonable cost.  Particularly say from a diesel that has had
a gas inline 4 conversion, and you swapped in a gas tranny so you
could cruise lower rpm's.  An entire '83ish side shifter diesel 091 would
be perfect, but I'll consider a 4.86 or 5.43 that had found its way into
some other 091 box.

A 4.86 would be exceptional, but I'm not really sure how common
these are for the 091, and if they were VW origin or aftermarket.

002 rears need not apply, sorry.

If someone has a diesel and has been yearning to do the conversion
to the 4.57 I can give in partial trade a good running '82 box with 4.57
which is unfortunately extremely corroded externally (WV winter salt)
particularly the bellhousing, not that that will matter as you'd be swapping
on the diesel bellhousing.  I figure this tranny has about $100 value
(runs OK looks bad on the outside, doesn't pop out of any gear, unknown
mileage as it is a junkyard replacement that found its way into the '81,
has had nice GL4 oil change and showed no chunks at the time.) 

If anyone has a dead diesel box that say probably merely had syncro
trouble (pops out of 4, whatever) that would be ideal if the ring and pinion
made no noise and are likely OK, I'll give offer corresponding to condition.

Thanks, will all trade any parts still left off my '81 or '87 for the same
in part trade, OK front bumper from the '87 comes to mind, don't know
what else really.
