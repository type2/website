&lt;&lt; AA)
 Let's say I go to order a set of spare points just to have on hand for my 
 Vac advance dizzy  in the event that my Compufire module fails on the road.
 BB)
 Also, I want to order a set of points for the spare .009 that I also keep 
 stashed in my spares box in the event of a &quot;total&quot; dizzy failure on the 
 part of the Vac advance installation. &gt;&gt;

Try this:

combine AA) and BB)    ( ABAB)?? ) and just keep the spare dist., all set up 
to go, as a spare.  Its just as much work to replace the points/condensor and 
reset them as it would be to replace the entire dist.
