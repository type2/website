Subject: Kustom Kombi Project - Update

Hello Volks!

Here is a status report on my Kustom Kombi project.  I guess I am looking 
to cause trouble as posting this will get Roy and all the purists on my 
ass (again). ;-)  I don't care though, as Sarah says &quot;It's my Bus&quot;.

For those of you who don't know, the Kustom Kombi project is a '66 
Microbus that I found last week that is virtually rust free and from 
Calif.  Over the next few months, I am going to be rebuilding it and 
customizing the heck out of it.

The 1641cc engine I have been building on the bench is almost done.  
Right now it is just a matter of bolting on the tin and accessories.  
Engine features include a mild cam, dual Weber 34ICTs, 009 with Petronix, 
deep sump, full-flow oil pump with spin on filter, and bugpack header 
with dual quiet-packs.

Yesterday, I called up Bus Boys and ordered the &quot;Albatross&quot; Beam and 
their IRS axle kit.  This will allow me to safely lower the Bus the 
4-inches I want in both front and rear.  I will not be putting 
dropped-spindles on as we originally discussed.  The Bus Boys &quot;Albatross&quot; 
Beam is a much better design.  I have Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of 
next week set aside for the new suspension to be installed.

Tyres/Wheel dept: My polished 5-spoke EMPI wheels came in yesterday and 
my plan is to wrap them in Pirelli tyres.  195/50x15's in front and 
205/60x15's in the rear.

Ok, are you guys starting to form the lynch mob yet? ;-)  As always, I 
will keep everyone posted.

Ciao!
