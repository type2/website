joseph,
im not real familiar with what holds down the westy
pop tops, but my riviera camper has metal hold downs
identical to ones on any Jeep CJ or Wrangler hood to
hold them down.   there is one in each corner of my
poptop opening (inside the bus) and they hold down the
poptop great.  they are not really noticeable inside
and im assuming they were ASI/Riviera installed.  
would be an easy add on as any 4WD/off road store or
probably RV stores would have these in stock.   just
my humble $.02 ;v)

73 riviera camper &quot;Lizzy&quot; (asking&quot;does that mean im
part Jeep?&quot;)
