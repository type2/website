Thanks for the helpful responses! I agree that the setup of the type1 1600cc in the  North American spec 1976 Westy has some shortcoming and pitfalls. I want to offer some background about this project which is something of a rescue mission. The mostly complete (except for a motor) but wrecked 1976 Westfalia camper was picked up for pocket change. The 1974 donor bus (in a most deplorable state) was free. The running (for now:) motor cost less than the 1976 bus. The goal here is to take  two abandoned buses and make one decent camper that will serve as a weekend driver. The cost ceiling is about $500 on this project and it looks like it might come in under budget. I agree that a type 4 motor is a better choice for endless reasons and it is the hope of the owner to ultimately install one which is why we want to avoid cutting the input shaft. Although this bus will never be a show winner it should serve the family well who owns it. 

Thanks to everyone for their responses :)!

Chris
