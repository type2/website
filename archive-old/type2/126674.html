Subject: Re: [T2] Air Compressor - What size?

I don't own a compressor but have used them for years. Buy the largest capacity machine you can afford and pay attention to the SCFM rating... I have seldom used an air compressor that could pump more air than I used when it comes to grinders and sand blasters. I've seen alot of big machines and some of them push very little volume of pressurized air. On the flip side I've got a tiny little compressor for pumping up tires and it makes all sorts of pressure but no volume.
