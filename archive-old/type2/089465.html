Attention list,

My friend whom I talked out of his blown engine has decided to part with =
his 72 transporter. This bus is in pretty decent shape.  Interior pretty =
clean.  He wants $500 for it, but I believe that he will wheel and deal. =
 If anyone is interested, PM me and I will get you in touch with him.  =
Please keep in mind that this bus has no engine, it's mine now (insert =
sinister laughter)
