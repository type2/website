Subject: Side View Mirrors

I need to replace the glass in both my side view
mirrors and just called Elite Auto Glass to see about
them cutting a few pieces for me.

They wanted $30 per mirror. Is that a fairly standard
rate? Anyone else had to replace a mirror lately? 

I just thought that $30 per mirror seemed kind of
steep. Especially when I can get the good OEM ones
from BD for a few bucks more new!

I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
