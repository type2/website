Subject: 67 Westy For Sale in MS

Well, after numerous attempts to talk him out of it, my friend has
decided to sell his 67 Westy.

Here are the particulars:
GREAT SHAPE
VERY LITTLE rust(If any)
original paint (white)
all interior stuff is there, e.g. curtains, cabinets, etc.
~60,000 miles
good poptop canvas
roof rack
original upholstery

one of the best split bodies I've ever seen.  (Not many here in the deep
south)
The caveat:
Engine problems.  Was overheated the last time driven, ~3 months ago.
Will crank and run.

He wants ~$4000 but will deal.  His info is:
Johnathan Poole
601.236.3387
Oxford, MS

Please help this bus go to a good home.

thanks
Shawn Clark
71 Westy (undergoing heart transplant)
