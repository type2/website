Joe, Karl, and John,
I checked John's data of 8/3/99 in the archive and determined that the 
values Joe stated for the resistance of his temp sensors was associated with 
temperatures of between 100 and 125 degrees F. Joe said it was a cold engine 
when he measured the resistances, which to my way of thinking could be 
&quot;unwarm to the touch&quot;, not necessarily ambient.
So I would be concerned to know before investing in new sensors, Joe, what 
was the actual temperature of the head at the time of your measurement?
And John, would an error in temperature ascertainment this slight be a cause 
for backfiring?
Just trying to save Joe a few bucks and more frustration...
