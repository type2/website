Subject: How do the retractable belts work in an accident??

So I installed the 3 point retracting belts into my 70 bug so my daughter
would be a little safer, but they don't seem to 'lock up' unless I really
pull them out quickly and even then only about half the time. Is this normal
? I believe they have some sort of locking up mechanism that requires hard
deceleration to come into play?? They are out of a 73 bug, and installed
just like the factory did.
Thanks,
Courtney
