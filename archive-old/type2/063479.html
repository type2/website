Subject: Clock wanted

Hey all,
I'm looking for a clock to fit my '73 Campmobile.  I realize that it will be
difficult to find the proper one, so I will take any of the clocks that will
fit  the 'loaf, including a type 3 clock.  Not running is fine, even
preferable since I'll probably have it rebuilt anyway.

Knowing that several recently changed hands at prices of $5-$20 on the list,
I got kinda anxious.

Thanks,
Dean
