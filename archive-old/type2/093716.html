Subject: wiring help needed

I have succeeded in removing and installing the engine/tranny from my first
VW bus, a 78 Westy.  Through experience I found that tagging wires with
masking tape is a REAL bad idea, because after they get greasy the tags are
illegible.  I have everything hooked up but two mysteries

There are two wires with push on connectors near the starter and two male
push on terminals on the solenoid, but how do I identify which wire goes to
which terminal?  The five wires with round connectors obviously go to the
screw post so I think no problem there.

Second Question:  I have a 4-6 inch piece of blue/black striped wire with a
female connector at each end, but no idea of where it goes.  Any help would
be appreciated.  

I got the District of Columbia DMV to very reluctantly give me a 30 day
extension on my temporary tags, to allow for inspection.  The bus in in
Delaware in my back yard still on ramps, but I do need to get it running
ASAP  to either drive back to DC to inspect, title and register, or
alternatively, do it in Delaware.

I will state that although because of a stripped CV joint bolt I had to take
engine and tranny out separately, It was a lot easier putting the joined
pair back in than just the engine by itself.  I will never ever take out
just the engine again
