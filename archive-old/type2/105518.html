&gt; - Headlight &quot;Tear&quot;: Another, &quot;Just a thought&quot;.  This one would be an easy
&gt; &quot;do&quot;, but I've not quite figured out the significance of the crying VW
bus,
&gt; yet.  Anyone want to clear up my ignorance?

My thanks for the many replies that I got on this one.  I now know a lot
about the Grateful Dead, and have a graphic of the (original?) tear bus from
the RS ad.  (I never really got into rock and roll, in spite of being a
teenager in the 60's and early 70's.)

BTW, this isn't a sticker or applique... [grin]

- Horn Button... mastering mold partially complete...

- VW Nose Logo Replacement: Giacomo's is missing...

Peace symbols, smilies and bus club logos seem the route to go.  Though I
could always scale up and sculpt the end bit from a &quot;loaf&quot; of bread bag, the
end of the bag that opens up, complete with a twist tie.

I could also do up a &quot;blank&quot; frame sort of thing that would allow the bus
owner to add their own art to it.  If someone was interested, I could also
supply them to an artist at wholesale for use and resale as a painted end
product.  Family crests, anyone?
