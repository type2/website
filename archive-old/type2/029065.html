Subject: re: brake diagnosis

Hi George
A wheel cylinder may be leaking into the boot yet the leak may not yet be
apparent unless you actually pull the wheels and pry into the boots.  Same
applies to a master cylinder, except you don't have to pull the wheels.
How's the fluid level been?

&lt;On the first brake application of the day, pedal goes halfway to floor
before brakes engage.  After a couple of applications, play reduces to
normal.  If you let the car sit for several hours, the symptom repeats, but
if it only sits for a few minutes it does not.&gt;
