Subject: Crappy Muffler - Update

Wednesday night I stripped the paint off the new muffler and welded up all
the seams and joints, and filled up the gaps around the heater clamshell
thingies.  The metal on this muffler is real thin, making it a PITA to weld,
even on the lowest heat setting and a pretty slow wire setting.  The top and
bottom long seams were pretty sketchy.

I then painted it with Rustoleum BBQ paint.  I really don't expect the paint
to last too long, but I had it laying around, so what the hey.  It will
hopefully last longer than the original stuff.  The stuff has been drying in
the warm house since Wed night, and hopefully tomorrow I'll get it put on.
