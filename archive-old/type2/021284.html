Steve:
I see where this is headed and am really concerned that some of you out there
are considering using the BN-4 or BA-6 as a camping heater. Carver (or Porpex)
made camping heaters and possibly the newer Espars for truck sleeper use, might
be okay, but I sure wouldn't trust any of the old Eberspaechers that I've had
to make heat clean enough to sleep in all night! I'd want to add a flexible
exhaust pipe about 10 feet long at least. IOW, they were ALL stinky! Clean
enough if you were moving, but scarey if sleeping. I don't think they were ever
made for that.
At very least I'd carrry a portable CO detector.

&gt; &gt; Also has anybody else thought or gone through with installing the heater
&gt; &gt; somewhere else besides the engine compartment? I was thinking maybe
&gt; &gt; under the z-bed.
&gt; Hmm,
&gt;
&gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much less
&gt; burning it there.  You are on your own, but from a safety standpoint i
&gt; dont think i'd ever consider putting a gas heater inside the bus. What if
&gt; it springs a leak in the middle of the night, you want it separated from
&gt; yoru sleeping loved ones (or if you are single &amp; love yourself, loved
&gt; one) by 1 foot of airspace or a firewall?
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, I know some old splitties had one inder the dash inside the bus 3
&gt; inches from the passengers Knee, but ask me if I am looking for one...
&gt;
&gt; take care,
&gt;
