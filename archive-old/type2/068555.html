When spotting a spliitie bus on TV yelled out. He thinks he has officially
&quot;lost it.&quot; 

VanBondo thinks that he is close but (new Friday thread?)

**You know that you have TOTALLY lost it when...  **

While watching TV you are rolling video tape, per the usual, &quot;just in case&quot;
and then subject the tape to single framing computer graphic techniques to
enhance street signs or other landmarks and then go to Bakersfield and try
to track it down.

or

You are happy to watch &quot;the Odessa Files&quot; with the sound off while listening
to an old &quot;Autobahn&quot; album, taking notes on how many various VWs are in the
background while sipping Reinskeller's worst. Totally loosing it means that
you do this while dressed in leiderhosen and oversized bumwoolens.

or... ?
