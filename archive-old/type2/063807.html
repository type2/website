Subject: Mysterious electrical box - what is it???

Volks,

While attempting to rewire my dashboard/fuse box, I ran into a small, metal
box mounted upside down on the metal piece that supports the steering
column.  It is rectangular, and has the lettering, &quot;150-10 12V&quot; stamped on
the side of it.

There are several wires coming off of this box that go to various places,
none of which I can find listed in either the Haynes or Bentley manuals.
One large red wire runs to the back of the bus somewhere - another goes to
the headlight switch, and another is spliced into an always-hot wire from
the fuse box.

On the back of the box there are five lugs, numbered 1 through 5.

1)   Center, 2 spade connectors
2)   No spade connectors at all
3)   1 spade connector
4)   1 spade connector
5)   1 spade connector

I'm thinking this isn't something from VW, although it looks like it's been
in the bus for a long time.  I think maybe it was something put in by
Safare.  I suspect it's some sort of relay, but I really don't know.  I'd
like to remove it if it serves no useful purpose.

Anyone care to guess what this is?  Does anyone else have one in their bus?
Please help, I really need to get my dashboard put back together.  :)

Thanks,

- -David
