Was there Saturday, in my favorite junk yard, and there is TWO SOLID 
stands/bases for seats, and two crummy living room bucket .

For an interested individual with a regular bus, you could mount one or two 
of the stands/bases right behind the passenger/drivers seats, and make your 
5 passenger bus into a conversation pit for 7 passengers.

Simply pull the tracks (home made tracks on both the seats and the bases, 
but workable) off the crummy living room seats (silly green bucket seats!!) 
and attach them to regular VW bus seats or the seats of your choice.  Bolt 
the bases to the floor as you wish.

Of course, the seats would not turn, but what the heck, you could bolt/weld 
on two turntables from some Westy passenger seats and make it happen.  I 
think Ron even has two turntables in his inventory.

of course you could get the same product from any van conversion shop, but 
not at junk yard prices.
