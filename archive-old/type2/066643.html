Subject: Re: Warranty hassles

Thanks to everyone who replied, I really appreciate your input.

Rehash: A mechanic trying to back out of a rebuilt warranty which has &lt; 
2000 miles and only 90 lbs in #3.

An update: I've talked to the mechanic again telling him that his 87 octane
causing a rebuilt engine to overheat is not valid. Telling him about all of
the feedback I got here seemed to get him to abandon that tack. 

I've done a bit of legal research and found out a couple of things. To have
any legal recourse should it be needed, I have to have him do the work. I
have no option there other than to do it myself and give up on the warranty. 
I asked him what circumstances might cause the warranty to be invalid. He
could only come up with a paper towel caught in the fan causing it to
overheat. 

Has this happened to anyone? It runs all right and doesn't feel overly
dipstick-hot even after a good stretch on the freeway. He said the paper
towel thing several times, so I'm afraid he's up to something. Are there any
other things that he could legitimately say are not his responsibility? No
one but him has worked on this engine, and he did the 500 mile tune up. 

I've found that should it come down to it, I have a really strong
small-claims court case (doesn't hurt to have a sweetie in law school...) I
really don't want it to come to that, but I've had enough negative mechanic
experiences to want to cover myself, not to mention this guy's octane excuse,
not returning my phone calls, etc. 

This whole thing seems weird to me because I've done all my own VW work 
including engine rebuild for 5 years now. But weighing a bunch of 
work-shed hours in the cold damp Oregon autumn vs. free work that was 
guaranteed leaves me trying to get him to do the right thing.

Knowledge and experiences are greatly appreciated.
