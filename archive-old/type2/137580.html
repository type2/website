Subject: Weber 34 ict air cleaner + brake hose

I am in the process of fitting Weber 34 icts to my van and have a few 
questions. The engine in question is a 2 l TIV with a single weber 
progressive. (I know that I can do better than the 34 ict carbs but I hope 
that they will be much better than the progressive).

- Has anyone tried fitting the stock dual carb air cleaner to the weber 
icts? I am hoping to get some warm air in to overcome the lack of chokes on 
this carb and also to get cooler air in when the engine warms up.

- What is the internal diameter of the brake booster hose? I have seen both 
15/32&quot; and 1/2&quot; suggested. I presume the original hose was a metric size 
(12 mm?)

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
