Subject: chuckle head

should i chuck my 1600SP cylinder head? while grinding my valves i found
2/5 of the aluminum is chipped off an exhaust valve guide. some say it'll
be okay; that a lot of rebuilders get sloppy. others say there's less than
5-10 thousand miles left before a valve gets burned. others say new head -
don't think about it, feed it to the core pile. what is your opinion, great
list? have you burnt a valve this way, is there life worth saving within
this cylinder head?
