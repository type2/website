Subject: Re: [T2] ridge at top of ring travel

I have 7k on the engine.  I overheated one cylinder and I'm replacing
that cylinder and piston (put a hole through the piston).  I also wanted
to change the rings on all the cylinders so that the compressions match
up...

Will cylinders that new have a ridge?

I will measure them to see what they're like.

Mike

&gt; If you have much of a ridge, expect the piston to cylinder clearance to be
&gt; excessive. If it is out of spec, new rings won't last long. Replace pistons
&gt; and cylinders. A spezial tool is used to remove the ridge on motors that
&gt; are designed for this type of rebuilding (Not VW AC). It is called a ridge
&gt; reamer. If you use the hone, by the time you get the excess off the top of
&gt; the cylinder you will have honed a big taper into it. Just can't be
&gt; expected to work. Measure the clearance between the piston and cylinder at
&gt; the top just under the ridge. Compare to spec. Before you waste time/money
&gt; with overhauling used cylinders.

&gt; &gt;I was reading the instructions that came with my new rings, and it says
&gt; &gt;to remove the ridge in the cylinder at the top of the ring travel or
&gt; &gt;risk messing up the new rings.  How do I do this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I just ordered a craftsman honing tool to break the glaze on the
&gt; &gt;cylinders.  Will this be sufficient to drop that ridge down?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
