Subject: Bus stalls at lights, no idle

My daily driver blew up just after Labor Day, so my 73 is my driver for now.
  She's been doing just FINE, we are as one, you should see us slide through 
L.A. traffic, like buttah. We passed Dan in his '79 on the freeway on the 
way home last night.

So this morning I start her up to haul some stuff to my other job which is 
a mere three blocks away, and it seemed like she just wouldn't get warmed 
up, even though we sat for 10 minutes before we left. And she stalled at all 
the stops and lights. When I went out to get some lunch and do some grocery 
shopping, she was no better. I tried raising the idle, but there was absolutely 
no change when I adjusted the idle screw on the left carb. The connections 
between the carbs look okay, the boots are on and not cracked. The little 
spring on the left carb that broke on my way to San Antonio was there and 
looked okay. There doesn't seem to be untoward slack in the throttle cable.

It's just like before -- once she's going, she seems to run fine on the open 
road, but as soon as the speed and the idle drop, she stalls.

When I got home this evening, I pulled the distributor and here's what I found:

a) The cap had fine metal shavings in it
b) The top of the rotor looked pretty funky
c) When I pulled the distributor out, I heard something fall out of it, but 
when I dug around on top of the engine I just came up with some charred bits,
  no metal, nothing like a screw or anything
d) The points gap was tight and the contact point was icky (a very small point,
  not as bad as I've seen the points fried before)

I replaced and regapped the points, cleaned up the contact points on the rotor 
with an emery board (it still had a black dot in the center), did the same 
to the center point inside the cap (which is not stationary but &quot;floats,&quot; which 
surprised me), put it all back together, and checked the dwell (right on, IN 
ONE!). But I had to prop The Club on the gas pedal to hold idle to check the 
dwell. Back to Square One.

Mr. Dolan is convinced it's something to do with vacuum, since it was borderline 
low when he checked it back in Georgia. That stuff is all Greek to me, but 
I traced all the hoses as best I could, checked the brake booster line, and 
couldn't find anything loose, unplugged, or cracked. However, I know enough 
to fear that hissing noise I hear in the engine compartment.

Oh, and The Spark Plug Wire Test at the distributor indicates that the right 
side is not pulling its weight, but I do have spark jumping the gap from the 
wire to the distributor on those two wires. When I pull 3 and 4, the engine 
falters; not so with 1 and 2.

Yrgh. Any ideas? I'm supposed to be in L.A. at 8:30 tomorrow morning, and 
I'll hear no end of grief for being late (I wish I had a dollar for every 
time someone asked me why I don't buy a new car), but I'm thinking of just 
showing up at my mechanic's when they open at 8:00 to see if they can figure 
out this vacuum thing.
