Mike sends:

&gt; in the June 2001 issue of VW trends there is an article on indexing your
&gt; spark plugs, (facing the gap in the right direction), does any body know the
&gt; correct direction for a 2000cc engine????

Doesn't matter, unless you have a Robert Yates engine in your Bus.

Indexing the plugs in high-compression racing engines is important mainly
because the piston has been known to hit the side electrode and bend it in
if it's not aligned properly. There are also flamefront issues that should
really only concern people for whom a half-horsepower on a 750-horsepower
engine could be the difference between a fifth-place finish and a
seventh-place finish.

For the rest of us, making sure you've got anti-seize on the threads and 25
lb-ft of torque on the plug is more important than in what direction the
side electrode's pointed.
