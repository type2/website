I would hardly consider the &quot;Mean People Suck&quot; sticker something for bus lovers
to rally around, since I've seen 'em on lowered homeboy trucks and old Honda
Civics. &quot;kill your television&quot; is a more likely choice.

&gt; Rochester.  Keep an eye out for an orange bus with a &quot;mean people suck&quot; 
&gt; sticker on the back...that'll be me.

Yow!  A &quot;Mean People Suck&quot; sticker!  I don't have one of those for my
disguise-a-bus collection yet--nor one of its hilarious [but perhaps too
naughty for mention, even on a Friday] sequels, which I've also seen
around town. 

Have a good trip, Tom--and meanwhile, list members, what other bus-for-
all-seasons window stickers should we be collecting, to keep all the bases
covered? [I gather there are no stickers yet for
type-2_at_lists.primenet_dot_com?]

curiously,
