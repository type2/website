&lt;&lt;I'm looking for tires for FreeBird because the PO put passenger tires on it

not knowing any better. I have been looking at the Michelins MXT (205/75-14)

vs Yokohama Y370 (195/75-14) tires.

The Yokohamas have a higher load range (D) than the Michelins and have a

more aggressive tread pattern. Since I live in a &quot;all season&quot; area, I need a

more aggressive tread pattern like the Yokohamas. One of the other major

items is costs. There again, the Yokohamas are less money making them more

cost agreeable for me.



In a nutshell:

Michelin MXT (205/75-14) Sears $110/ea,

                                      Costco $69/ea.

Yokohama Y370(D)(195/75-14)Tire Rack delivered price $71/ea,      Sears

matching and beating price $66/ea.



The Yokohamas win hands down. Less costs, higher load rating, better tread

for all season driving. Plus many list members testify

to their quality.



I placed my order with Sears (5ea Yokohama Y370 (D)) today.

&gt;&gt;

I use the Yokohama Y370s on my '74 Campmobile and like them.  Their
availability in the past has been sketchy though.  A little less known tire
that I recently put on my '93 EV is the Nokian.  If you're looking for a great
M + S tire in a D rating, check out 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.inhouse_dot_ca/nokianALT/nrw-tmsc.html&quot;&gt;Nokian Tyres (North
America) Ltd.&lt;/A&gt;

The NRW is available in a couple of different sizes.    It is priced about the
same as the Y370.
