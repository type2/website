Hi Dok,

&gt; Letsee, 2.0 FI on a carbed 1.7. That's different cam profiles, different

&gt; combustion chambers, different compression ratios.

So, all 2.0L engines must remain bone stock? No cam changes? No distributor
changes? No matching of head volume? No flow improvements? No after market
mufflers?

Tell me it ain't so Tim.

And when I buy that long block 2.0L rebuilt, or used, engine do I have to find
the specific fuel injection system for the CA manual trans, auto trans, 49
state manual trans, auto trans, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, GD or GD, hyd or
mech lifter engine?
