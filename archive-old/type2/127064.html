That's the spring washer that goes around the axle, and it is indeed to
be omitted on the bus (but left in on the bug, for some reason).  The
washer they are talking about here goes under the triple-square bolts.

As an aside, I've always reused these washers without any loosening.  I
didn't know that they were supposed to be replaced!
