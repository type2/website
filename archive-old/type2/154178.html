  FIXED!!!!)

It's never a bad time to mention it.  When I did the rebuild on the engine
that's in the Guac, there was no better time to replace all the lines.  I
replaced all the vent lines as well.  I wanted to replace the larger line
from the pump to the filter with the correct one instead of something that
would just work from FLAPS.  In the end, I had forgotten about it.  Don't
make this same mistake!

umm, would this be a good time to say 'everyone replace your fuel lines?'

if you don't know how old your fuel lines are, or if they're more than 
__ years old--
REPLACE YOUR FUEL LINES!!!

ALL OF THEM!!!
