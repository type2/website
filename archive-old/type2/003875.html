Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop hinge question


 [...]

&gt; Today I removed the hinges from a 72, a 73, and a 68. All BUT the 68 were
&gt; metal-to-paint. The 68 has a very thin vinyl liner on the bottom.
&gt; I found out another one-year-only difference. I already knew the 73's were
&gt; improved using flat stock steel like 74 and up, instead of aluminum tubular
&gt; guaranteed-to- bend stock. [sorry, the 74's I removed were junk so I left
them].

OOPS  = Typo.... that should say ''sorry, the 73's I removed were junk so I left
them''.
