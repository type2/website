Subject: Re: 72 bus progress?- flood problems!?

In my experience a flood vehicle is not worth the bother/expense- I
boutht a Karman Ghia when I was in college, and it had been in the
Oneida flood- All the heater ducts had imposswible to get at mud/silt in
them and it would forever blow out dust!  Water and dissimilar metals
don't mix, as you found out with pulling the engine- replaceable engine
aside, the bus will have corroded connectors, rocker passageways that
will rust from the inside,
cables, brake pistons that will be frozen, switches won't work right,
and corroded bearings in the trans.  A friend's whose vehicle was in the
flood had plenty trans problems, carburation that never worked right
(turned out to be corrosion in the gas tank that kept blocking his
filter), etc!  MB 78 Westy 213,600  mi on unrestored engine!
