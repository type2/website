Subject: Asbestos?

Hello

Whilst working on my bus last night I noticed the tube that carries hot air
from the heat exchangers right through to the front of the van has
completely rotted through.

What worries me the most is the look of the insulation material used to
cover this pipe.  It looks remarkably like asbestos, I am obviously very
concerned at the thought of having such a deadly substance anywhere near my
van let alone as part of my heater system.

Does anyone know if this substance is asbestos or am I worrying over
nothing?
