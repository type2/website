Depends upon the wrecker.  If it's from a wrecking yard they are used to
dealing with wheelless wrecks.

&gt; I know that it will vary depending on the wrecker, but a knowledgable
&gt; former listee mentioned that I should consider grabbing both the front
&gt; axle beam, and, because it's a camper, the torsion bars as well.  I could
&gt; do this, and end up with it on blocks, but will I be able to get someone
&gt; to take it away in that state?

You could pull the torsion bars then reinstall the swing levers which then
would just sit on the bottoming stops.  It would still roll, although it
would be a low rider!
