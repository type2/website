Subject: Fuel leak +ACY- check your fuel lines



+AD4-I crawled under to change the fuel filter +ACY- fit a 'T' piece, I noticed a
+AD4-dark spot on the line near the outlet. I wiggled it to see if it was a leak
+AD4AJg- the pipe started to drip, by the time I had got a big fuel container the
+AD4-pipe had poped off+ACE-

This happened to me as my 79 tank is the same, only the whole L shaped pipe
fractured and came off. There was nothing to attach a pipe back on to so I
had to get a big zinc bath underneath to catch the fuel - almost 5 gallons
came out. Shit. Only recently before that we had a guy burned to death in a
camper fire in our village. I'd never met him but had seen his camper and I
went round one Sunday morning to say hello. The van was gutted and it had
nearly taken the house too. He died two weeks later.

I took as many precautions as I could but still nearly fried. The main thing
I  was trying to do was drain the tank to reduce the risk of fire before
taking it out. All I can say from this is run your tank as low as possible
first. Still it only takes half a pint of petrol and I'm told you have the
explosive power of a stick of dynamite, so there doesn't seem to be a
perfect answer to this.
