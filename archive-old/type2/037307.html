Subject: Re: compression

&gt;I really don't se a direct line of causation between p-rod seal leaking and
&gt;valve guide wear, nor do i see a relation between comoression and valve
&gt;guides.

I'd say it exists in a purely secondary form time wise.  A high mileage engine
with worn valve guides is also an engine with old rings.  An engine with old
rings is an engine pressurizing the crankcase to some extent during running,
extent varying on how much the breather is clogged up, etc.  This is leading
to pressure up the pushrod tubes, and past the outer seals, driving oil onto
the ground.  Thing is, as I've mentioned before a good tight O-ring seal of
that
size should be good for actually hydraulic range pressures, or at least up to
100's of psi.  Now I will say that if you've ever cranked a high miler without
valve covers, you do get whooshing out the valve guides as well, probably
a minor contributor though as the gas is expanding into the exhaust, but it
exists, and is enough to make those annoying whistling hisses from cracks
right behind the valves into the exhasut guide bosses, or out of incorectly
set
heat exchangers, so there is suffiecient gas pressure that can blowby the
guides as well.  They most certainly are a seal to oil and to combustion
pressure.
As to what really casues the problems, likely a whole multitude of things.

My take on it at least.  Simply a problem of higher mileage engines, not
likely corrected by new guides alone IMHO.
