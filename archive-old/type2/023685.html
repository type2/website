Subject: Swamp cooler

I forgot to mention this item that I have for sale.

It is a NOS Bon Aire VW Bus floor mount chiller in perfect original
condition, still in it's original box.

It also has a 12v transformer, so it can be carried into a motel room at
night.

It also has the original instuction sheet.
It is really a neat gizmo, as it has a bottle, or can cooler built into
the lid, and a bollte opener on the side of it.
 
I would like $250.00 OBO.

Thanks,
