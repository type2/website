&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt;      I need some input.  My 82 aircooled westy will not pass DEQ.  All the
&gt;  tuneup stuff has been done.  I took it to the shop I frequent when I can't
&gt;  do it my self &amp; this is waht they told me.  The CO is 3% before &amp; after the
&gt;  converter.  That obviously means the converter is bad.  The other thing is,
&gt;  the mechanic had to back out the CO screw on the airbox all the way to get
&gt;  it to 3%.  Here is my questions.  How much will the catalytic converter
&gt;  lower the CO? Also, would you just get a CAT &amp; try DEQ before buying a new
&gt;  AFM?  Thanks in advance for the help.

Well, the Cat on my bus emits CO at 0.00% and HC at 36ppm. I accept this 
isn't very realistic as the test station recorded the engine temp at 17C 
(63F). I would have much preferred a real test with the engine warm then the 
recorded HC should have been lower.

Good luck
