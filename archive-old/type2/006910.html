I happen to own a Sage Green 1976 Deluxe Westfalia, and mine is very close to 
stock, as I bought it from the second owner with 76,000 miles on the 
odometer, but I have no VDO clock on my dash.

'The Peace Bus' features the 110V refrigerator, stove, 12V sink, water tank 
in the cabinet, childs cot, and front and rear tables, plus of course the 
outside hookups for water and power.
