Subject: Porsche Engine Swap

I might have the opportunity to obtain (for very few $$$) a Porsche 912 
engine and 5-speed transmission.  The engine will need to be rebuilt (threw 
a rod), but the transmission is in great condition.

The 912 engine is essentially the same engine as found in the late model 
356s.  Will the engine/transmission be a simple drop-in replacement?  Will 
I need the the Porsche's half shafts (actually, I believe one of them is 
from a bug)?  What about just using the 5-speed transmission?

I have seen posts referencing &quot;lucky people with 356 engines&quot;, and I'm 
trying to figure out just how lucky these folks are :-)

TIA.
