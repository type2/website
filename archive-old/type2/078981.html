Subject: Where to and fro doth these hoses go???

Hello all,
 I am working on my 75 westy trying to get the motor cleaned up and adjusted
so that it will run and idle. I have several hoses that either end in a bolt
clamped in it or patched in to another with some kind of home made
connector. Is there any web sites that have pics or instructions as to how
to hook up these things. I looked in my bently and it wasnt much help.

Thanks,
Bryan
