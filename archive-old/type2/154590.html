Subject: Re: &amp;*%^$#$$  Heater Boxes, U-Pipes and exhaust leaks. Gotta be

Hey Courtney,

    Well... you CAN still use OEM equipment... but, if you don't really need 
or what the heater, then this is what I would do...

I would take your heater boxes and cut off the surrounding metal. I suspect 
that really the J-tubes inside of them are still in OK shape... If they 
are... then clean them up, and send them off to a place to have them ceramic 
coated. This shouldn't cost you more than say $150-200 bucks. Once you've 
got them coated, they won't rust... your Bus will run cooler, and you won't 
have any of that nasty tin work attached to it that typically rusts. Plus, 
the mounting points for the engine tin work will also still be there.

Then, you can just go with a factory OEM replacement exhaust...
Also, if you use stainless steel hardware, it'll last much much longer too.

something better.
&gt;
&gt;Ok I'm fed up with rusted, crap heater boxes, U-pipes with corroded rusty
&gt;crumbling flanges and numerous exhaust leaks. So what are my options? Do we 
&gt;have J-tubes available to &gt;replace the wholestinking heater box system?
