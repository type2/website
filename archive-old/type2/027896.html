Tommy,
Thanks for the suggestion, I'm in error. There is also a condenser on the 
dizzy, so the one I noted to be attached at the coil must be, as you say, 
for the spark noise supression of the radio. It has been so long since I 
looked at the distributor from the top, I forgot that it also had the 
condensor at the usual spot. The noise supressor cap is not shown on the 
wiring diagram, so I assumed it was the points cap, in error. It is 
interesting that the Bentley wiring diagram doesn't show the radio or its 
power supply other than to mention one fuse is set aside for accessories.
Roland
