Did you check with &quot;Mr Bubblehead&quot; Franklyn Tyler on Baily Hill Road? 
He'd know.  He has a pile of busses (renovates &amp; sells parts) and the
biggest bus model collection you'll ever see........I live in NJ but
dropped by there in 95 on a cross country trip- he started the original
VW &quot;bulletin board&quot; on the Prodigy Auto BB's in the early 90's......

&gt; Good people,
&gt; Can anyone recommend a paint shop or individual in the Eugene, OR area that
&gt; has painted buses?
