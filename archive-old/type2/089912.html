Subject: 75 bus fuel smell

--part1_199.9e75887.2a681324_boundary

Hey everyone  the wifes 75 seems to have a faint fuel smell in the front.  
She says it gets worse when the tank gets low.  I have not seen any leaks but 
last month the injector hose on 4 broke and sent gas everywere.  Yes It is 
equipped with a fire extinguisher.  Maybe she is extra sensative but im 
looking for ideas.  
Thanks
