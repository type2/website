Subject: vent window glass

Need help.I successfully rebuilt one of my front vent windows but am having
trouble with the second one.  Do you think that this glass sealant/adhesive
will work instead of pressing the glass and rubber seal into the frame?
Have any of you tried to do this before?  Is glass adhesive strong enough to
actually hold the glass in or is it only designed to work with gravity and
the weight of a windshield?    I am thinking of using the few pieces of
rubber I have left to hold the glass straight in the frame and fill in the
rest with this adhesive.   Thanks for any help you can provide.
