&gt; My engine has run hot since the beginning 

&gt; 225 the light begins to flicker or glow and if
&gt; the oil temp goes higher the light goes to a 
&gt; steady glow...this sensor told me my problem 
&gt; was more serious as the engine was over heating
&gt; on the freeway after just 10-15 miles at 65mph.
&gt; I had to go 60mph and hope there were not any
&gt; hills... [sealed up the heater hose inlets with
frozen orange juice caps]
&gt; I can travel 30 miles or more at speeds of
&gt; 65-70 and never get any hotter 
&gt; than 212 estimated temp.

Great story.  Good to here of success.  I hope
you lead others to consider there systems.  

I've heard that &quot;it's supposed to run hot&quot; and
&quot;you're supposed to run vw's hard&quot; crap from
these self-proclaimed guru's that really don't
know about making a VW run well and run for a
long time.  You'll know them by there chrome
009s.  

My guess is that, despite the list's efforts,
most are running around with hot engines, either
from poor timing, poor carburation, or poor
cooling.  I keep reading posts suggesting that
listmembers run 250 all the time.  This always
makes me cringe.  Others, usually the folks
without guages, say they floor it up the hills
and drive 70-80+ mph consistently.  No wonder
these engines don't last.  Dropped valve city.  

Kudos to you, brother.  Happy bussin.
