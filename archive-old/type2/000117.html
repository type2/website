    I have trying to split my case for a couple of days now and it won't go.  
I have a T4,1800.  I think I got all the nuts and bolts; 6 17mm nuts (bolts 
won't come out), 7 13mm nuts and bolts, 9 13mm nuts, and 2 10mm nuts.  I have 
not been able to remove the oil strainer but I did take the cover off.  Would 
the strainer hold things up?  So far the case has come apart a hair on the 
top but the bottom will not budge. I have hit it from every angle with a 
rubber mallet, knocked the notches at the corners with wood blocks, used a 
piece of wood like a wedge in the breather holes, and hit on the studs.  Can 
I use a propane torch to heat the seam?  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.
