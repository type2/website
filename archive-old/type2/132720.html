Subject: Re: [T2] Syncro Diesel Questions

Hi Mark,

The  type2 list can't really be much help with this kind of question. 
You'd be better off asking the Vanagon list.

www.vanagon_dot_com has information about the Vanagon list and there's also 
a link to the synchro list posted there.

Happy trails,

&gt; I am looking at a 86 Synchro, and was wondering what happens if the
&gt; viscous coupler goes and how much it costs to replace it? This one has 
&gt; a
&gt; 5 spd with a  96 Passat diesel motor in it. Is there anything I should
&gt; look out for with this vehicle?
