Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

&quot;Has anyone ever taken one with a lot of rust on it and sand blasted it?
...not the seal surface, but the rest of it?&quot;

No, I haven't gone to that extreme, but I have roughened my own flywheel 
using 3M's disc-brake resurfacing wheels.  They(and a drill) worked really 
well.
