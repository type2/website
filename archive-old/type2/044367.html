Subject: [T2] RE: Westy water tank leak ('79)

&gt;I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area where
&gt;the pump motor screws in.

I have the same crack in my water tank on my 78. It required a 2 part fix,
goop (a rubber cement, I'm sure silicone would work also) applied to the
crack and then a hose clamp around the threaded area to keep it from
spreading again when you screw the pump in.
