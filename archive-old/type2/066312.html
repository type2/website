Subject: '70 Camper KYB Shocks Installed &amp; Question

Veedubbers...

Well I spent yesterday afternoon doing my first ever shock install. 
Removed the old shocks from my '70 camper and installed some nice new
KYB gas-adjust shocks.  Those old things were in BAD shape and what a
difference these new ones have made. Solved my front end &quot;crunch&quot; noise
problem.  While under the front end, I noticed that some of the rubber
&quot;seals&quot; or bushings or whatever they're called, (I think they are the
&quot;ball joints&quot; from looking at Bentley book) are worn pretty bad and
nearly splitting.  Can I replace those individually i.e. without whole
new torision arms or whatever?

Oh yeah, I got the KYB shocks from a local place here in Boulder called
Recycle Auto Parts for about $38 each.  If you're ever in the area, look
them up - they have nearly everything you'd want and Jim, the owner, is
as friendly as helpful as I've experienced.  He doesn't even mind
answering my &quot;dumb&quot; newbie questions!  Of course, usual disclaimers blah
blah blah.

Mike
