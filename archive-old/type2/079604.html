Subject: Free 1972 Bus Tranny, Must Pickup

I am moving and I have a 1972 Bus Manual transmission.  Outer case is dry, so no leaks. It has been sitting for 4 years.  As far as I know it is good.  It was in a bus with an engine running on 2 cylinders so I could never get the bus to go fast enough to try 4th gear, but all the other gears I was able to try.  

I am in Arlington, MA.  You must pick it up if you want it.
