&gt; turn your engine to TDC of the compression stroke on cyl #1.
&gt; (verify this by making sure the valves on #1 don't want to move
&gt; anywhere near this position)
&gt; 

Hello  You can verify TDC by rotating the engine clockwise and watching the 
number 1 cly intake valve, When it goes in keep rotating the engine till the 
timing mark comes up  This will be TDC. Otherwise you could be at BTC which 
would be the number 3 cly  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
