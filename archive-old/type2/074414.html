Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bilge Blowers

Hey Bruce,
Thanks for the archive link - that helps.
Good idea about using the rear window defroster - mine
never works either - I also like Scott's idea of
getting a two or three speed windshield wiper switch.
I could mount one (a VW switch from a donor) and be
able to select speed!
What about Scott's comments on noise? Is your set up
loud? Any ideas about mounting the blower back under
the center of the bus to reduce noise? This might also
push more air to the rear vent when desired... My
defrost is o.k. - I am just trying to get more volume
of heat. I just don't think the little fan in the
engine bay is sufficient.

&gt; 
&gt; I followed his instructions to the letter and it
&gt; worked great.  I'd highly
&gt; recommend his approach.  I used the defroster switch
&gt; (from the rear window -
&gt; hasn't worked in years) for an on/off.  You can get
&gt; more sophisticated, but
&gt; I have the original fan blower for one level of
&gt; defrosting and kick in the
&gt; bilge blower for extra power.
&gt; 
&gt; Got mine  (Atwood) at a boating supply store /
&gt; marina;  I think it's a 3
&gt; 1/2&quot; Fit right into the heater tube under the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; P-mail me if any questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A couple questions for those that have installed a
&gt; bilge pump in-line with the bus &quot;heating&quot; system.
&gt; Where did you mount the thing? Did it replace the
&gt; existing blower motor or supplement it?? What size
&gt; blower did you go with (3&quot;- 4&quot;??) A link to where
&gt; you
&gt; found it would be cool.
&gt; Thanks for the info.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.
&gt; The unit I asked the list about previously from
&gt; Bluebird comes out to be about $150 after shipping
&gt; blah, blah, blah - so I am definitely looking for a
&gt; cheaper alternative. Bluebird has some really cool
&gt; stuff for the type2 but the darn shipping kills it!

&gt; Rick said:  For those of you
&gt; that have purchased and installed bilge blowers,
&gt; would
&gt; you please send
&gt; me a
&gt; source for them so I can order one?
&gt; 
&gt; You can purchase these at any marine supply store.
&gt; They are used to
&gt; blow gas fumes out of
&gt; inboard motors before startup.  They come in 3 &amp; 4
&gt; inch (I think) and
&gt; should only be about
&gt; &gt;$20 US.
