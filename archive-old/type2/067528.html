Subject: smoke from the alternator...!?!?!?! (fwd)

OK here is my hairy situation (and Lawrence if you are reading this...it 
is Bertha {sorry})  and I hope it is less of a problem than i am thinking 
it is:  here goes
1) tried to hook up a stereo in my 78 westy, think i grounded it out or 
something
2) dead battery, in fear of frying my FI computer, I did not jump it, 
instead pulled battery and put it on a 6 amp trickle charge
3) **First problem** read the ammeter on the charger wrong (it's upside 
down if you ask me!!!!!) and way over charged my battery, guessing if i 
look at the meter i'd say it would be reading about 125%
4) so its sunday, and my the guy i talked to before at this place that 
does VW's (only he says theyare trying to get away from type II's) is 
closed I call pepboys, open on Sunday, and he says its volts that messes 
with computer, not amps, so i should have no problem.
5) so i wrestle th battery in there...not an easy task either, hook up 
ground no problem. as i am trying to get positive on i get a few sparks 
at the terminal, and i wont fit on very well, not the problem, actually i 
thinkit may have saved me a little...here is the big problem
        SMOKE COMING FROM MY ALTERNATOR!!!!!!!!
WHY????????? is this something that i am really going to feel bad about? 
or am i just overreacting? i know i should wait until i can talk to the 
VW guy, but i have a paper to do today, and i can't get my mind off my 
beloved not moving in the past 4 days bus....i think i will ha ve to 
meditate.

So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE email me with any ideas and help, or if you live 
in The SW michigan area, near Kalamazoo, let me know if you can help at 
all, i hve been looking around for some Volks folks in the area, but 
can't seem to locate....thanks in advance

peace
