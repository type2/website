&gt;Hello Everyone...
&gt;
&gt;Today is a work day, yesterday I was able to remove the fan shroud, all engine tin, etc... Now I am down to a bunch of dirty parts caked with sludgy, caked oil. I am curious of the best way to clean these components?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

When I did the same thing i just soaked mine for a day with engine 
cleaner, spraying a decent coating every hour or so.  Then got a stiff 
nylon brush (some old clothes; you'll get small black spots on you:) and 
brushed like hell.  If you haven't planned on painting the tin I would 
do so.  Once the caked on stuff comes off you'll see that alot of the
paint does also.  Better still, powder coat them if you have the time
and bread.  Take care of any cracks in the tin now also.  I wish I had.
