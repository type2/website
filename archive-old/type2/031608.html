*snip*

I was speaking more to a gas leak, I wouldnt want to sleep with rubber gas
lines running right under my bed. Wether you are using the heater or not,
gas vapor and static electricity from moving around in the bedclothes, or
if you have some other heating device running, etc... Just doesnt seem
like a great idea. You are right, it wouldn't make a great camping heater,
but even if you dont have it going at night,  running gas lines next to
your bed might still be inadvisable. (put a can of gas hooked to an
eberspacher under your bed at home and see if it worries you or
not... maybe go from there, JUST KIDDING don't do that, but you get my
point maybe... gasoline is very dangerous stuff.)

take care,

Steve
