Here's an excerpt from
http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/Engine.html:

don't know the validity, but it sounds pretty reasonable:
--------
Exhaust wrapping is fiberglass-mesh webbing, approximately 3 millimeters
thick, and about 6 centimeters wide. It is applied by moistening the
mesh, then wrapping the exhaust spiral fashion. The webbing hardens into
a chrysalis around the pipes.

Its purpose is twofold. First, to insulate the exhaust tubing so the
waste gasses do not cool immediately after leaving the heads, thus
maintaining their velocity. This is important. If the exhaust cools
suddenly on leaving the heads, it slows down, making the motor work
harder to push it out the exahust tubing, muffler, and tailpipe. Don't
forget, it is the force of your piston that has to do the job of pushing
that exhaust out, wasting horsepower.

Second, the insulation prevents the glowing HOT exhaust tubes from
radiating tremendous heat (infrared) to the heads. we forget about this
IR heat sometimes, but if you turn your motor off after a hard run ahd
put your hand near your bare exhaust, you will feel the tremendous
toasting action. All of this IR would normally bake the lower portion of
the heads as they are trying to stay cool. Counter productive.

Finally, you want the exhaust to stay hot for another reason though:
namely more available heat in your heat exchangers. As an added benefit
you get cleaner emissions. The emissions decrease is due to the hotter
temperatures &quot;afterburning&quot; unburned exhaust/fuel products. VW's
afterburner pipe was for this reason, but the original insulation never
lasts more than a few years. This product more than adaquately replaces
that afterburning effect. Most importantly, though, all of that heat is
now available for release INSIDE your heat exchanger, driving the
heated-air temperatures through the roof.

The product works so well you can grab your exhaust system with an
ungloved hand even straight away after highway travel. This serves no 
real purpose, and is not even handy enough to be an entertaining party
gag, but it is interesting nonetheless. The total increase in
temperatures in our heat exchangers would be hard to codify but our heat
works better than many water-cooled vehicles, and I know this product
was key to acheiving this.

&gt; Tom,

&gt; Glad you're on &quot;our&quot; team.  So what you are saying is that Tex-exhaust is no
&gt; hotter that Wa-exhaust, right? ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Me thinks now the ceramic coating may be a real bad idea for air cooled
&gt; beasties of the street for the reasons you outline.  I definitely want
&gt; immediate heat dissipation from the exhaust ports.._dot_can we say overheating
&gt; and cracked heads?  It would be more conclusive if someone had accurately
&gt; measured temperature at the head before and after installing a ceramic
