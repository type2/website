&gt; You will not pass California smog inspection if you remove the EGR.  
&gt; There
&gt; is a visual inspection where you will be failed immediately if any of 
&gt; the
&gt; emissions control equipment is missing.  You can bet they check for NOx 
&gt; in
&gt; the tailpipe emissions test too.  Since your Bus is a federal model I
&gt; think California will take a $300 smog impact fee (or did they stop 
&gt; doing
&gt; that recently?)

luckily, they stopped doing this and even retroactively refunded money 
to people.
