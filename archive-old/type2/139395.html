Subject: fuel-pump cut-out alternative

Oh my, is there a limit on questions per day?

The AFM in the '78 (w/79 engine) works perfectly except that the fuel 
pump trigger is always on (with the ignition).  From the archives, I 
gather I can substitute a &quot;normally-closed&quot; relay wired in with the oil 
pressure light warning switch.  Could someone double check my circuit 
idea?  Where's a good, non-destructive place to get 12v switched power 
in the engine compartment.  I figure I'll only have to chop one harness 
wire (from the AFM to the double relay).  Hate to do it, but AFMs 
aren't that cheap!

Circuit:

Normally closed relay gets 12v switched power and ground and is 
triggered to open by oil pressure warning switch.  I'm not sure whether 
to unhook the solenoid trigger to the fuel pump (which is on while 
cranking).

thanks much,
