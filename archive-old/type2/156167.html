Subject: Re: auxiliary battery

Hi Tim -

my secondary-battery experience, for what it's worth:

I've always stuck with marine deep-cycle lead-acid batteries (would
love to try an Optima, but as yet the funds haven't been available :-)
Just don't use a regular (non-deep-cycle) battery, as you probably
already know.

I'm dismayed with the short lives of several Sears Die-Hard batteries
I've owned in different vehicles (although I guess they live up to
their name - they sure do die hard...), but apart from that, have no
real brand preference. I'm currently trying a Kirkland (Costco)
deep-cycle battery in the van. I can't see the label very well, but I
can read &quot;marine cranking amps: 750; cold cranking amps: 600&quot; - don't
see an Amp-Hours rating, but I believe the one I had before this was
around 100Ah, and it keeps my refrigerator running from Friday night
until Sunday morning on a weekend camping trip (without running the
engine after arrival). It measures about 12&quot; L x 8&quot; H x 7&quot; D, and fits
in the space below/behind my spare wheel well, on the left side of the
engine bay in my '78 westy.

Hope this helps
