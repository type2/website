&gt; I can see where Karl's comment below would be totally on target about 
&gt; the larger Benz wheels being WAY too wide.

Even if you get a set of 16&quot; rims that are narrow enough to fit in the
wheel wells, the aspect ratio (185/70/14, for example, means that the
sidewall is 70% of the tread width) will hafta be quite short to maintain
the same outside circumference of the tire...and why those huge rims on
the pimpmobiles have such thin sidewalls (and why they can't take a
pothole without blowing out and usually damaging the rim... ;-(
