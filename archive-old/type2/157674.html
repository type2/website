That story rather smacks of the &quot;200MPG carburator&quot; tale that has been
going around for many decades.

Look at it this way:  Batteries have been used in many devices for over
100 years.  The makers of the devices (most of which have never used
gasoline at any point in their history) would love to have smaller,
cheaper, and/ or higher-capacity batteries.  Battery technology has
improved incrementally over time, but is still limited by the chemistries
available for batteries.  There are a limited number of elements and it is
unlikely that a new one with a markedly higher electronegativity will be
found.

There is just no way that the energy density of a battery will exceed that
of liquid fuels  You canna' change the laws of physics.

I would put my money on someone coming up with Mr. Fusion long before
anyone comes up with a 75 pound battery that will hold as much energy as
75 pounds of gasoline!
