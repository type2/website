Subject: Moving to Atlanta

As of July 1, I'll have taken my leave of Baltimore and have taken up
residence in Atlanta.  Some questions/issues:

(1) Between now and then, I'll need to pack, and, as part of that
process, trim my stock of VW parts.  So, anyone in my present or future
vicinity that has particular needs should feel free to let them be known
to me.

(2) I'll also need to drive and/or tow to Atlanta any VWs I don't let go
here in Baltimore (that's three late model busses, a beetle, and a
squareback, with the later two needing work before they could be
driven).  I figure that, as I need to make at least one trip down to
Atlanta this month, I should drive a bus down and fly back, leaving the
bus there.  However, I don't have anyplace in mind to stash the bus.
I'm wary of leaving it someplace where it will offend somebody's
sensibilities and get towed.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

(3) I know that recent cars must pass an emissions test, but I haven't
found any info about a safety inspection requirement.  Is there one?
