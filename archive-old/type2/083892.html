Subject: Weber Prog - part two

OK. So I started her up this morning and started spraying carb cleaner
until I isolated acrack in the manifold! The rubber &quot;boots&quot; are fine. Doesn't matter how
much I spray them, theRPM remains the same. But that crack in the manifold...

I pulled the carb and manifold.
The crack is just below the vacuum port for the brake assist. I cleaned
the manifold as good asI can. Used a file to roughen up the surface and applied a liberal coat of
JB Weld over the areaof the crack.

I then turned my attention to the carb. I sprayed it off with carb cleaner
and polished it some. I looked for identifying marks but could find none.
It sure looks likeall the pictures of the Weber Progressive 32/36 DFEV. About that time the
UPS guy pulled upwith my order from BusDepot - including a rebuild kit for the DFEV. With
luck, tonight I willrebuild the carb with my father's guidance - giving me something to do
while the JB Weld setsup.

Has anyone had any experience with using JB Weld in this kind of
application? ShouldI put JB Weld on the inside of the manifold (where the crack is coming
through? I'll probablyswap this out in the fall for dual carbs, but or now I'm trying to save
bread.
