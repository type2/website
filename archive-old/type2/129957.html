Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Fresh Air/Heating Levers?

I, too, have been wondering how to get those blasted plastic clips off w/o 
breaking them.  I'm glad to see I don't have to worry about that any 
more!  Thanks for the good news.

&gt; &gt;The good news is that you will never miss them.  The levers are held in
&gt; &gt;place by the leaf springs very nicely.
