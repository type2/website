Subject: Mr Scissor hand goes wild... Dreaded cut engine wires

Hello,

I am about to tackle a serious cases of &quot;Mr..Scissor Hand&quot; going wild in the 
engine compartment. The previous owner obviously was not to impressed with 
VW's way of wiring. Some wires are cut at the firewall, others are a little 
more accessible.

So before I started is there any advice on &quot;does and don'ts&quot;? I have a donor 
wiring harness that I will be using so at least the wire color and size will 
be the same. Should I pick up new connectors for splicing wires and a 
crimper? Any good connectors and crimpers recommended? or Are they fairly 
standard?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
