Subject: Free pop top in MA.

 Hi All,
      I have a pop top in my backyard that will be cut up and disposed of this
weekend unless anyone wants it. I got it for free several years ago as a
replacement for a cracked one on my first 70 Westy. It is the same size but
different in appearance from the one on my 70 though so I think it is from an
earlier bus. I live in Brockton MA and if anyone wants it come and get it,
otherwise it will be disposed of this weekend. My friend thinks I should build
a parts shed and use it for the roof but the Wife just wants it gone.

      Thanks

-Jeff
