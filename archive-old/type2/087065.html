&gt; I get 22-24 w/ stock solexes in the flat areas

well I'm not quite as flat and I still run the stock FI system, but it
seems to get that kind of mileage you would need to be running pretty
lean??

&gt; &gt; better).  Amazing how the milage
&gt; &gt; &gt; went from ~18 to 22-24.  (and it blows half

&gt; &gt; OK  I want to know how you get 22-24 out of a
&gt; &gt; big old Westy when driving
&gt; &gt; my 78 deluxe pretty much the same way I have
&gt; &gt; never managed to get more
&gt; &gt; than 20 on a good day with a tailwind
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and of course around the city where I live I
&gt; &gt; consider it a good day when I
&gt; &gt; get 16 in stop and go traffic
