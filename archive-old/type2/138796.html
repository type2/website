Subject: Fan scraping on housing, need help

dressing my newly rebuilt 1980 engine in all the parts that go on the long
block. Turned the engine ofer by hand and discovered that the cooling fan is
scraping in the housing.
1. I have taken the fan off &amp; inspected for grit between the fan and spacer
and hub.
2. Tried a different spacer.
3. retorqued the hub.
4. Reseated the pulley on the fan.
5. loosend and reseated the housing.
Still scrapes near the 12 oclock position when the timing mark is about 3
oclock. The frustration is at it's peak. the temperature outside is dropping
and I hate cleaning up in the dark.
