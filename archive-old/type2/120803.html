&gt;The question is whether the coil functions on *all* tdc's or just number

I was thinking of how the ECU picks up the coil signal. You could divide the signal by 4 or use a trigger on wire #1.

&gt; if just number one, does that imply that everyone put their 
&gt;flywheel back on a rebuilt engine correctly?  Mine is still there on my 
&gt;original engine...like you though, just haven't had time to look yet...
&gt;and the windchill here this morning is 11 degrees!

Isn't the flywheel indexed by a pin?

&gt;Did it just have 2 wires on the plug end?

3, including ground
