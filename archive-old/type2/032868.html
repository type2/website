Subject: The Baton is Moving Again!

Just completed an exchange of messages with Chris in Knoxville and will
meet him in Sweetwater, Tennessee, at Noon tomorrow, Saturday, to pass the
baton for its next leg. I have notified those &quot;downstream&quot; and will pass it
to them within the week.

On the road again,
