&gt; That's an idea. Does JB weld add strength?
&gt; 

Hello Mark  Good to heard from ya again  .  take a die grinder and make a 
bevel on both sides of the crack then JB weld  This will increase the sealing 
surface area and make it stronger . You also do this with welding  Later and have 
fun  Mark dearing
