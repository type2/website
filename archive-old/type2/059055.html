Subject: 34 PICT-3 Tuning Anomalies

So Pandora wouldn't idle consistently, sometimes she would idle fine but
often she'd die at stoplights. I could think of no other explanation but a
blockage so I just rebuilt the carb.

Now she seems to idle consistently but I have some concerns about the idle
screws.

Maybe I should mention that the PO had soldered up the hole in the throttle
plate per the Boston Engine solution for flat spots. But since I am a bear
of limited brain and I want as few variables as possible to deal with, I
drilled the hole back out again.

Anyway, in contrast to the other 34-3s I've fooled with, the little gas
screw actually does something on this carb, in fact the idle will keep
rising as I turn it out WELL past the suggested 2.5-3 turns. It finally
tops out, and I turn it in a little like I'm supposed to. I pretend I know
what 30 rpm sounds like.

But then, to bring the idle back down to 850-900 I have to tighten the air
bypass screw all the way in.

Vacuum leak? Lemme go spray the joints, waitaminute.

No, propane doesn't make the idle change and all the gaskets are new and
tight and it doesn't run hot.

&gt;From the smell of it, turning the gas screw in makes the idle richer. In
order to keep the idle below 1000 the exhaust needs to be pretty stinky. It
seems hackneyed to bring my idle down to spec by choking the engine. I
don't know what's wrong.
