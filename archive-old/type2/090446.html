Subject: RE: [T2] AFC injection problem

40 deg total advance !!!  IMHO its sems a bit
high, ive heard the maximum its should be 32 
dgree on type 4 engine!!

But not in VW's humble opinion.  Here are the
specs from oldvolkshome_dot_com for a 7.5btdc timed
engine (note it's about the same for the 5 or 10
atdc engines): 

&quot;Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC _at_ 850-950 rpm (Man
Trans), 900-1000 rpm (Auto Trans) w/strobe,
vacumm hose connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8.5-11deg Adv _at_ 7.9
In. Hg; Centrifugal: 8-13deg _at_ 1600 rpm,
20.5-24.5 _at_ 3400 rpm&quot;

Sooooooooooo............

7.5 btdc + 11 + 24.5 = 43 total advance at 3400
rpm and full vacuum is within the high end of
spec.  

I have no clue about timing a 009 or 050 on a t4
and never intend to learn as neither can provide
anywhere near this amount of advance.
