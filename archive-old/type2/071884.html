&lt;&lt; Hmm. I think I can tell you why. Quite some time back there was 
 discussion of selling cds of the archives, to fund the list. Quite a few 
 folks pointed out that A: they owned the rights to what they had written; 
 and B: they hadn't given anybody permission to sell them for financial 
 gain-even for the non-profit support of the list.  At the time, the general 
consensus was 
 that there was no way permission could ever be gained from all of the 
 persons whose work would be in the cd. Since the job of trying to get 
 permission from all of these people was not possible, there were two 
 options. 1. publish it, and risk being sued or some such on down the 
 line, or 2. don't do it. Obviously the choice at the time was #2. &gt;&gt;

Whatever the reason, we've all lost a really valuable resource.  I know I've 
used it more than once, and it was a great help.
Oh well, all good things must come to an end, I guess.
