If you have this module in 
your ride, can you give me some direction, as to what the rotor is, before I 
&quot;fix&quot; mine. 


I am assuming by the rotor you mean the round piece that slips over the cam 
portion of the distributor shaft that is under the rotor?  If so it is simply 4 
magnets in the round piece of plastic that trigger the hall effect switch in 
the ignitor body.
