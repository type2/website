&gt; I put a 2.0 F.I. engine (known to to start and run

&gt; thought I hooked everything up correctly. I start it
&gt; and it starts right up, but then dies within 1 second,
&gt; like fuel starvation.  I thought I hooked everything
&gt; up correctly, but I have NEVER had a F.I. bus before,
&gt; so I don't even know where to start looking to
&gt; troubleshoot this particular problem. Any suggestions?

sounds like missed connection in your double relay.  the starter energizes
the fuel pump but stops when the engine starts, but the air flow meter is
then working and powers the fuel pump,  all this is controled by the
double relay.
