Subject: bubbles in fuel line

I have a stock 1600DP with one of those transparent plastic filters 
in the line between the output of the fuel pump and the 34PICT-3 The 
engine starts but won't idle.

If I keep it running at higher rpm by pumping the throttle, bubbles 
continually flow into the plastic filter. The filter stays full of 
fuel, as I think it should. But I don't recall seeing a stream of 
bubbles flowing into it.

To isolate my engine from the fuel tank / line,  I led a fuel hose 
from a jug of gas on the floor by the engine to the fuel pump input. 
Same symptom.

Any comment on these bubbles?

Thanks, jack
