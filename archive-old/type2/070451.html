Subject: Jets for Weber on Vanagon

I have a 80 Vanagon Westy, that I converted to Weber carb (the single/two
barrel progressive) because the FI died. At the same time I converted to a
header type exhaust right after the heater boxes because the exhaust
parts/cat were toooo expensive and unavailble. I now have some trouble with
the Vanagon lugging and then just taking off like a bat.  Could someone
please tell me how you they have their's set up, what jets you're running,
idle and otherwise, timing, etc.

Also my engine runs at a temp of 230-250 degrees which seems hot to me, how
about anyone else out there who may have a temp gauge?
