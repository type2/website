Subject: Introducing the Riviera Registry

Calling all Riviera owners!

The Riviera Registry, dedicated to bringing together all early (read: split
bus) Riviera owners, is now up and running!  If you own a Riviera, please
send me a picture of it with the information requested on the main
page.  If you think you might own a Riviera, check out the guide and see if
you're right!

Here's our rather cumbersome URL (we'll get a domain name soon, I'm sure):
