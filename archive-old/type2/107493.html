Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber Engine Mounts

I would replace them. If you hit a big bump you might tweak something.
Busdepot_dot_com has them PN#  021 199 231C

I know you'll have to remove some or all of the exhaust system. Then you can
remove the metal support bar (the &quot;Mustache&quot; bar).  From there I think you
can get to the top nuts for the rubber mounts. You might also need to remove
the fan &amp; the fan housing.

I'm looking at the rubber engine mounts on my 75 bus and the rubber's torn a
little on one, and both top bolts aren't connected to the rubber portion on
the engine side.  Is this a &quot;super glue&quot; job, or should i invest in some new
mounts?  Where's the best place to get new ones?
