&gt; Hello All:

&gt; Is it possible to remove the heads from the engine in a 71 bus without removing the engine from the bus?

No.  The upper head nuts are covered by the cylinder tin which is held in
place by the fan shroud and intake manifold.  To pull these you have to
take the engine out.

It really isn't that hard to pull the engine.
