Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 74 bus basically no idle

Here is another thing that might explain the high
compression ratios. Is it possible that this is a 914
engine instead of a bus engine? what is your engine
number? I know that the 914 Porsche uses hight
compression ratios. This is just a thought. Although I
do not recall reading compression readings for a 914
being that high. Anyway, good luck!
