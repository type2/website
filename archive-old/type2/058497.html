Subject: Smoke in oil

Hi Volks,

I have a fresh rebuild of a 73 1776 with a brand new weber dual carb.
Whenever I drive just two miles and open the oil filler tube I  have smoke
in my oil .  The mechanic says it is normal , but it has never done that in
the last 5 years of ownership unless it was running very hot.  Which by the
way after driving 30+ mins you can not touch the dipstick.  He is tuning it
to 10 degrees BTDC I thought it was supposed to be ATDC.  It also will
stall at every stop until warmed up and no power in first or second.  I
have already had numerous arguments with this mechanic but am now out of my
scope of knowledge.  He has had the bus 95% of the last 3 months about 5
times.  Please help with ant advice I can get to help this mechanic get my
bus into working order.  All I want is to be able to drive it normally and
trust me He will never see my bus again or any other bus owner I know.

Peace

Snoopy
