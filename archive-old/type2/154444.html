Subject: Missing third (?) cylinder

Folks, I have an interesting problem ... 2L dual carb engine - one cylinder
is missing at idle and low RPM. Once engine gets up to speed the missing
cylinders kicks in (noticable).

I did a compression test (wam): #1 170 PSI, the other 3 in the 180-190 range
(this engine has 914 P&amp;Cs).

Plugs look all good (all dry and none fouled or oily) and I regapped them to
0.6 mm (per Bentley). Cap looks good, ignition is breakerless (Vanagon).
Wires are fine, too. Pulling plugs one by one indicates that problem is with
third cylinder (no difference in idle whether plug is connected or not).
However, plug and wire are fine: good spark - I had the plug out sitting on
top of the engine to verify operation.

So, this would only leave vacuum as a possiblity, right? But this is a dual
carb eninge (36-40 PDSIT - no central idle circuit) with no emissions
contols, so the only vacuum connections are the distributor advance, balance
pipe, and brake booster connection. How can I have a vacuum leak in this
setup that would affect #3 only? The brake booster connection is on the
balance pipe - it is closest to #3 but it should affect the opposite
cylinder as well if I had a brake booster issue - right?

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Marcus
