You think that's bad - it's even worse when it's covered with black oil.  :)

&gt;On a related topic, anyone know where the notch should be pointing at max.
&gt;advance on a pancake engine?  I've heard 30 degrees bandied about, but I
&gt;think that's for an upright; is the Type 4 any different?

Good question, and I'd like to know the answer.  Mine goes well beyond the
max reading of the black plastic scale (36?  40?  can't remember) when I
accelerate.  Last time I mentioned that on the list I got grave warnings
about too much advance, impending engine explosions, etc. but it loses
power if I retard the timing back to say 32 degrees total advance.  Plus,
my engine is still running. There must be some difference (cam?) that
requires a lot more advance for the type IV.  Anyone know the answer?
Regardless, I plan to continue running 40+ degrees total advance.  Who
knows, maybe my timing mark is off?  I assumed the notch in my fan was at 0
degrees, but maybe it's really 5?  At times like this I realize how little
I really know about VW engines...
