Subject: Re: [T2] Tips on tightening oil filler tube on type 1 engine

Look down inside the filler opening and you will see a
slotted nut that needs to be tighened, VW has a
special tool for this but you can use a piece of flat
iron cut to fit the slots and a pair of vice grips to
turn it with. There is a gasket that fits it in the
O/H gasket set. Phil
