Subject: Getting to know my bus

I've got the bus on ramps (and chocked) and spent a fair amount of
time gazing, swabbing, and taking pictures of various parts I'm
concerned about.

Would you mind passing me some community advice?
73 Sportsmobile 1700 w/ Holley

~Oil leak
I've got a slight oil leak coming from behind the thermostat.  2-3
inches on concrete after parked.  I can't quite tell where it's coming
from.  Thoughts? In picture below.
Negligable loss running around village blocks.  More noticable when
learning and backing it up on ramps.:-P

~Thermostat

No cable in sight, very grimey and hard to clean.
(Thanks for the article, German Supply. If my picture is helpful,
please take it and use it..even if it is as a &quot;before&quot; picture :-})

~Fuel pump
Mechanical fuel pump with a nipple pointing down at an angle without a
line attached.  Fuel line from tank to pump, pump to carb is new. Big
lines coming from the back of the carb out sides is much tougher than
the new fuel line and no cracks in sight. Funky quarter sized
connector when viewed from behind rear tires. No fuel filter.

~Carb
There's a nipple right under the filter (facing back, above left-not
the fuel line) which has no tube or plug.
There a tube coming from right below the carberator facing the rear of
the engine which is blocked with a golfing tee.
Carb is Holley with codes &quot;L6503 2870&quot; on aluminum plate near filter.
Let me know if posting a picture would be helpful.

~Emergency Brake
Are the two cables above rear tires with accordian grommits emergency
brake cables? Mine aren't connected to anything.

~Oil Pressure Switch
Oil pressure light failed On position check. Passed when wire was
grounded. Cleaned and tightened wire and connection, still no light.
Next step is to replace oil pressure switch?

~Aesthetics
Looks damn cool with rear raised and front lowered.  Source for
swampers and hydralics?
JUST KIDDING.

Would you drive 10 miles to camp this weekend?
