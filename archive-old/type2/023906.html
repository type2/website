&gt; 
&gt; I have a '69 campmobile and really want to get a power outlet 
&gt; hooked up inside my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I know it used to have one because there is a hole where It 
&gt; used to be...
&gt; But how would I go about doing this?
&gt; 
&gt; I think the smartest thing would be to hook it up to a 
&gt; separate battery that I could put under the seat or 
&gt; something, but I also want it to charge back up while I'm driving.

&gt; Can someone point me in the right direction as to what to do 
&gt; or to any sites out there that may have info on this sort of thing?
&gt; 
Hi all,

I've recently done the same thing here, installed a deep cycle battery in
the space in the engine bay on the opposite side to the normal battery,
emulating the original battery tray etc.

I bought a kit from a company in Australia called Jaycar.  This allows me to
charge both batterys, the kit will isolate the second battery until the
first is fully charged (my starting battery) and then it will charge both.
With the ignition off the batterys are again isolated and the deep cycle
runs the fridge, lighting and stereo.  I also installed a generic fuse box
up the front of the Bus to run the accessories from.  This allows me to
switch them off and on from the drivers seat so I can turn the fridge etc
off and on whilst driving.

Checkout my Baja Bus site at http://www.baja_dot_com/Kombi and go to tech and
the electrics.  You'll find a wiring diagram and some more details there.
Hope this helps
Cheers
Steve
