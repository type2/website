&gt;         The lock cylinder and the actual switch are two different things.
&gt; Changing the lock isn't going to do diddly for your problem. Sounds like you've
&gt; got a short in the wiring somewhere. Did you actually run a wire back to the
&gt; starter and battery for your &quot;hotwire&quot; setup or did you just connect to the
&gt; burnt off wires?
&gt; 

The key got stuck in the lock cylinder and would not turn or pull out,
so I'll probably have to replace it anyway. However, I _did_ use the old
wires that were there. They fried the old switch, but I put a new one on
that handled a larger current and it works.

After a long time running, the switch I have wired up to it gets very
hot to the touch. So, is this normal? If so, then what happened to the
old one? Should I run some new wiring to make sure?

			Many thanks,
