&gt; Once the oil companies discovered this, they improved the GL5 standard to
&gt; GL5-MTI (VW aren't the only gearboxes to have bronze components), which is
&gt; NOT corrosive to VW gearboxes and is quite safe to use. GL3 and GL4
&gt; standards are quite OK too.

I found some more information:

The good news is your synchros won't corrode, according to this information:

&gt; Passenger car rear axle lubricants require score protection as well as thermal
&gt; and oxidative stability and rust protection. This is provided through the use
&gt; of sulfur-phosphorus lubricants. Requirements for these lubricants are
&gt; described in the API GL-5 specification.
&gt; 
&gt; The requirements of many equipment builders exceed those of the API
&gt; specifications. As a result, SAE and ASTM have updated GL categories to
&gt; reflect present and future needs. This action has promoted the development of
&gt; gear lubricant categories API MT-1 and proposed PG-2, which are designed to
&gt; meet the performance requirements of North American heavy-duty or commercial
&gt; equipment. 
&gt; 
&gt; API MT-1 designates oils for heavy-duty truck and bus manual transmissions.
&gt; Its focus is on improved high-temperature cleanliness and stability, oxidation
&gt; and antiwear control, and compatibility with oil seals and copper alloys.

The bad news:

&gt; GL-4    Denotes lubricants intended for axles with spiral bevel gears
operating 
&gt; under moderate to severe conditions of speed and load or axles with hypoid
&gt; gears operating under moderate speeds and loads. These oils may be used in
&gt; selected manual transmissions and transaxle applications where API MT-1
&gt; lubricants are unsuitable.

&gt; GL-5     Denotes lubricants intended for gears, particularly hypoid gears, in
&gt; axles operating under various combinations of high-speed shock loads and
&gt; low-speed, high-torque conditions. Lubricants qualified under MIL-L-2105D
&gt; satisfy the requirements of the API GL-5 specification, although the API
&gt; designation does not require military approval.

&gt; MT-1     Denotes lubricants intended for nonsynchronized manual transmissions
&gt; used in buses and heavy-duty trucks. Lubricants meeting the requirements of
&gt; API MT-1 provide protection against the combination of thermal degradation,
&gt; component wear and oil seal deterioration. API MT-1 does not address the
&gt; performance requirements of synchronized transmissions and transaxles in
&gt; passenger car and heavy-duty applications.

GL4, will you ever forgive me? ;-)
