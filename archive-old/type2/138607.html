Subject: Hal Sullivan Balanceing

Please , I was not meaning to demean you about the balance within one dime. 
You have provided a discussion where a lot of great information was given. 
Sometimes I hate to say something for fear that someone will say something 
that might make me feal bad. I did not mean to start a discussion of the 
ultimate balanceing of a race engine. I'm sure that the last 2.0 that I 
built is way off . I did not balance anything inside that engine. I figured 
that if I kept it under 60 mph it would not really matter. Cree
