Subject: [T2] VW Trends Charity Cruise Report - Save The Bay Style

&gt;Jim Hayden sez...

&gt;	IMHO the VWT staff did their homework this time

Amen to that! Next year, mebbe they can find some routes that remove more 
left-hand turns - a major contributor to string-the-cars-out-itis. Limiting 
the stops to four total was much better also.

&gt;Bay Pilot Rupert from Austria...

was totally agog with the number of old VWs, period. 95% of the cars present 
would never have passed the stringent Euro-inspection. After all, if yer 
going to be running your bus down the Autobahn at, say, 200 k/h, they want 
to make sure your steering and brakes are modern, and in top shape!

&gt;Bay window attendance severely trounced
&gt;splitty attendance.

10:2.

&gt;HVW Drag Day winner Mike Visket

Hey - that's me! The video of the event is released (!) by Ocean Street 
Video (dot-com). I got mine throught Mr. Kadron for $16 - about $1 for every 
time the Drag Announcer (not Dyno Don) called Itch the &quot;Great White Whale&quot;. 
The best thing on the video is the 12 seconds of total silence from the PA 
after I win the final race against an 8-second, 90-mph Turbo-bug. I think 
they were having a &quot;moment of silence&quot; for all the Turbo-bugs that died that 
day. Hehehe... For those of you that get the Speed Channel, Auto Week is 
showing the event November 10th and 17th. Don't miss it!!

&gt;Dyno Don in his '71 panel van with the way-cool Type 1 motor
&gt;(if ya like that sort or thing in a Bay...).

Ahem... Dyno Don's bus is freakin' AWSOME, dude! Porsche fan shroud, and 
perhaps a mild 1776? This thing is screaming &quot;Turbo me!&quot;.

&gt;Bay Window hi-jinks included
&gt;faking out the bug pushers with FRS radio coordinated lane changes

'cuz the buggers were just following the crowd, every time we'd change 
lanes, they would, see? So, ala Blue Angels, we count down a lane change, 
5,4,3,2, NOW, and all 5-6 busses perform a beautiful maneuver, and you can 
see all the bugs scrambling to get into our new lane.. Plain, unadlterated 
fun!

&gt;numerous STB-instigated Chinese Fire Drills on the way into Kymco,

Yes, the same ones we did 25-30 years ago with our high-school pals... 'cept 
there was one pilot per each of the 5-6 busses doing the drill... the wives 
just hid their faces.

&gt;High point of the cruise (from the editorial we) had to be STBs very
&gt;own Ventura County Ambassador Bob Buehling ('73 panel van) winning the
&gt;Bugpack flanged 82mm, Ch*vy journal crank.

Congrats Bob! And Bob was proudly displaying a STB sticker during the photo 
shoot, so we might see it in the VWT coverage of the event? What are the 
odds?

As an aside, folks, any multi-bus event is made so much more enjoyable with 
the FRS/GMRS's. Highly recommended for any camping or carabussing - even if 
you don't want to do the Blue Angeles lane changes, parking maneuvers, and 
CFDs.

Hope to see even more Bays next year (ahem... GL &amp; NE.. nudge nudge)!
