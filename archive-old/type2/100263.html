Subject: [T2] RE: [VB] VW Drag day March 23,2003

Folks -

Ronnie sez:

  The over all winner gets $1000 dollars. The finalist in each class gets to
run the final for the money. Practice your reaction times and figure out
your dial in ET. Wouldn't it be great if a bus won over all, it could be
done!!!

  If my new bus is ready I'll run it

ronnie

So I sez:

I just got back from vacation, perusing through my digests, when I spied 
this thread. Boy oh boy. I'm the guilty one that set the boys and girls on 
their collective ears last September.

I thought we had at least one more meet before HVWs changed the brackets. 
Word must have gotten out that STBs was going to bring some friends to the 
drags next time ;)

Be that as it may, I think I like the new format. I didn't have a chance to 
&quot;go for the money&quot; after I took the Trophy-2 class. This new format 
guarantees at least one T2 will have a crack at it.

One more thing. It doesn't matter how fast your bus is! Reaction time + 
consistency + proper dial-in = win.

I'd like to see a big T2 crowd there come March (Ronnie - is March 23 set in 
stone?). I was the lone T2 last time (which kind of made it that much 
sweeter - hehehe). Let the other brackets do their &quot;serious&quot; stuff. We're 
there to have FUN! Who's in?

BTW - I heard a rumor that there's going to be a new flyer for the March 
drags - http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/STB/HVWDD/Itch_DragDay2.jpg
