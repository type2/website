Before you completely abandon this venture...

assuming the awia is a standard DIN size, memory says that if you use it
without the DIN sleeve, you only need to open the hole about 3/16&quot; side to
side, and maybe 1/16&quot; top to bottom...to use the sleeve, you'll have to
open it a bit more.

It would probably be well worth the effort to do this...
