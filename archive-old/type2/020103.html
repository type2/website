Hi Everyone,
		I am a farirly new VW owner. I bought a 1970 camper last year and I love it.
But now there is a problem took it to get PA state inspected today and there
were problems. on the passanger side the frame rail is rusted really bad. I am
just wondering if I can just weld a new piece of sttel in there. What kind,
thickness do I need? I have a little knowlege of welding, just oxy-acetaline.
I would appreciate all the info I could get. Also that underbelly pan is
rusted. can I just use sheet metal to replacce that or what? Thank you
everyone for the help. This list is a great resource
