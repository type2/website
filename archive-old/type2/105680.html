Subject: why not to use GL5

&gt;Subject: Re: [T2] tranny oil: Rancho sez....

&gt;Takes 10 or 20 thousand miles to eat you up. Kinna like cancer. Slow,
&gt;premature death.

clip
&gt;&gt;How long is it supposed to take GL5 to do real damage, anyway?  Minutes,
&gt;&gt;days, years?

This is not a myth!
I made it 25000 miles in 3 years before I figured out something was wrong.
changed to GL4 and 5,000 miles since then, but the end is very near
(there's no bearing noise, but goodbye syncromesh)

I would love to upgrade to a late 091, anyone have one lying around?

'70 Westfalia &quot;Rebertha&quot;  crunchy
'75 BMW 2002 &quot;Crusty&quot; &lt;---also recommends GL4, but who knows what the DPO
did
