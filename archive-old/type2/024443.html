Hello All!

     Today my bus died( its been running great), with no warning, and
would not start, after messing with it for an hour in a parking lot,
with the temp. in the teens and snowing. I finally call the tow truck
had it towed to my friends shop. I knew it was the AFM, but we checked
everything else to be sure,(fuel pump_at_35psi, Relays, vacuum lines, spark
to the plugs) everything checks out.
     OK less then two years ago I replaced the AFM(with a rebuilt Bosch)
after my bus backfired and blew the AFM apart. This time my bus did not
backfire, It just died. The flapper is normal meaning its not flopping
around like the old one did. So what gives?? Any idea's or things to
check? Any help will be great! Oh Ya! Its a 79 2.0l stock FI, pertronix
ign.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
