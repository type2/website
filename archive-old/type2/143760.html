Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

Phil quotes Gene Berg:
&gt; &quot;Remember, the heavier the oil, the less it lubricates... For freezing
&gt; temperatures straight 10 weight would be my choice.&quot;

IMHO this demonstrates that Gene Berg has some pretty kooky ideas.

I haven't had a whole lot of respect for Mr. Berg's opinions since I first
read his take on gauges a few years ago.  He basically says that all gauges
under about $200 are useless due to poor and inconsistent calibration.  Now, I
buy the idea that a low-end gauge might not really mean 220 when it says 220
-- heck, new cars' factory-installed gauges usually have no calibration at
all, other than maybe a &quot;normal&quot; range -- but that's the point, which Mr. Berg
misses entirely!  The purpose of temperature and pressure gauges is to be able
to identify an abnormal operating condition *before* additional damage is
done.

&quot;The heavier the oil, the less it lubricates&quot; sounds every bit as stubbornly
reductionist as &quot;gauges are inaccurate, therefore they are useless.&quot;  If it
really were true, then we'd all be filling our oil sumps with WD-40, and our
engines would be loving us for it.
