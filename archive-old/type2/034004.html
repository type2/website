Subject: RE: Fuel neck '78 Westy

&gt; I'm talking about the 90 degree bend at the top of the filler neck just
&gt; inside the gas cap - It's made of rubber.&gt;
&gt; No one seems to have one.
&gt; What type of filler neck does the Mexi-busses or the Brazilian
&gt; busses have?


This part is unavailable for now, having been discontinued by VW in Germany
(who also supplied Motorworks, West Coast Metric, myself, and everybody
else).  I have seen two of three samples from Brazil and Mexico and they are
totally different from the version used in the U.S.  Rumor has it the third
is right, but time will tell.  Meanwhile there has been some talk of repros,
but with a break-even point of many thousands of units, nobody has exactly
jumped at the opportunity.  I suspect that the problem will be solved
relatively soon, either with a South American part or a repro.  When that
happens, everybody (but the dealer) will probably have them at roughly the
same time, although as usual I plan to have them for less. :-)
