Subject: Looking for: bottom tins for 1800 engine

Hi all,
I'm desperately looking for the 2 bottom engine tins for the 1800cc Type IV
engine.  They are the ones underneath the engine, on either side of the
case, that cover up the pushrod tubes and direct the air flow.  For some
reason, they are missing on the engine I just rebuilt, and I'd like to put
some on, both to protect the pushrod tubes etc., but also to ensure that the
thermostat I installed works well.
I'm hoping one of you have a pair of these tins to sell to me for a
reasonable price.
Regards,
  --Robert
