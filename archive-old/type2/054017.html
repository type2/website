Subject: pilot bearing removal

ok, I've got a big problem on my hands.
I tried to remove the pilot bearing with a blade from a
hack saw, which didn't do much at all. What kind of metal is this
thing made of? Maybe I just don't have a good metal cutting blade.
I destroyed most of the edge of the on the bearing and so I
don't have much to grab onto :(
Some one in the archive said use paper towels soaked in oil
and pack them into the hole. Then i used a bolt with a big
head and stuck it into the hole and hammered away.
That didnt work but it sure was a neat idea.
So I only have the shell of the bearing in there.

Well, I am off to home depot to find a better metal blade to
cut this, if there is one.

Any one got any ideas I'll try just about anything now.

Alex,
