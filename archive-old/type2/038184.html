Subject: 1972 Kombi for sale in New Hampshire

Volks,

Again, I am selling off a ton of stuff to finance my trip to Italy.

I have a running, 95.5% rust free 1972 Kombi with all the seats and floor
mats and records dating back 20 years. Also and interesting PO history with
this one.

Interior in great shape. Original Gold paint. Small dents in front.
I will send compression check and pictures. (As soon as I have them) to
anyone interested. This would be an easy project.

This vehicle is set up with dual Weber single throat 40's.

Would consider a trade for a new aftermarket, typeI fuel injection system.

$2,500 OBO. 

Could set up as daycamper for $3,000.
