Subject: Type IV Rebuild

fellas,

i have recently aquired a 79 engine from a junkyard. i
would now like to have it rebuilt so that i can put it
into my 76 westy. i am aware of raby's aircooled
technology, and boston bob, is anyone aware of anyone
else who does Type IV rebuilds well, i would like to
shop around as much as possible before dropping
thousands of dollars. i am on the east coast in
allentown, PA if that is pertanent.

also, just because i would like to know, does anyone
out there know how much horsepower a factory 2.0 FI
2000cc Type IV engine puts out? and, is there any
difference in power between a 76 and a 79 engine?
Thanks in advance.

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
