&gt; &gt; ....and I hear the leak

&gt;
&gt; hmm,,, like pfft,,, rrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft  rrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft
&gt;
&gt; like the head isn't seating against the barrel..

uh huh!
&gt;
&gt; I just came across a set of new heads.... the barrel was actually seating
&gt; for the first few thousand kilometers on the shoulder of the barrel instead
&gt; of the rim.

except I seem to have all of the bolt heads thru, and the nuts went down
evenly.  but

&gt; The head recess was something like 7mm deep,, the barrel ext from the
&gt; shoulder to the rim is only 5mm ,,, so,, I ended up having a machinist plane
&gt; 2mm off the top of the first fin on the head.

hhmmm I have a bunch of new (old style) head seals wonder if putting them
in there might help???

&gt; The casting of the head seemed to have a little tooo much alum in the mold,,
&gt; and it was high in the center,,which held the barrel from seating
&gt; properly....

these are AVP rebuilds.

&gt; when I did the compression testing.. it sounded like rrruh rrruh rrruh
&gt; pfftrrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft

thats' what it sounds like...

&gt; I didn't even have the rockers on the engine when I did a leak down, putting
&gt; air into the cylinder proved the leak was between the barrel and the head...

well tommorrow I am going to try pulling em without taking the engine out.
but it means cutting the exhaust headers, again. and of course welding em
back up
 &gt;
&gt; hope that isn't your problem

sure sounds like it, sounds like no matter what it is a head pull, again,
is in the cards.

mumble mumble this is getting old. hate doing the same job over

thanks
Bob
