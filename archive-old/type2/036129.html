Subject: What Distributor Do I have

Sorry, I had a finger/brain check on that distributor number that
I have in my '71.  The real number is 023 117 036.  My main
concern is that I do not know what the correct timing is for this
distributor.  Sorry about the invalid number.  Would appreciate
it if anyone knows more about this distributor.
