...how to prep and store gas tank

Well, I'll toss in my own twisted logic here: 

If it's a good tank, the enemy is water. If it's a bad tank, the enemy is
already rust and moisture of any kind. 

The way to keep water out is to use denatured alcohol, pretty much the same
stuff they sell as Heet, only you can buy it for cheap by the gallon at mom
and pop hardware stores. I would:

1. Drain tank of gas--that stuff's dangerous, man.
2. Put drained non-rusty gas into running bus--best way to recycle.
3. Plug tank and put in a bunch (gallon or two) of denatured alcohol.
4. Carefully slosh tank, keeping myself protected from splatters, etc.
Would be more worried about eyes; I doubt it's bad for skin...other than a
drying effect, but I can't win beauty contests anyway.
5. Drain tank completely.
6. Repeat rinse as necessary to get tank clean.

If the tank turns out to be clean, like my '72 tank was, I'd put it up and
save it for future use or donation to another listee. If the tank turns out
to be rusty inside, I'd weigh my options now. It will continue to rust
unless you saturate it with oil inside or otherwise block off all air
(vacuum sealing may work, but really isn't practical).

I have cleaned tanks with muriatic acid, also available from hardware
stores, but I don't really like doing this. It's nasty stuff...eating skin
and more. But it eats rust gladly and sometimes I've had no other viable
options.

7. Store the tank in a place where it won't get moisture inside.

Keep in mind, I'm a hobbiest and not a professional. I won't be responsible
for damage readers may incur by putting to practice any of my hairbrained
ideas. (I'm not worried about you, Chris, but I figured I'd better disclaim
for the low-common-sense crowd.)

Have fun! Joe
