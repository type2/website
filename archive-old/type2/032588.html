Subject: Re: [VB] Gear Oil Nightmare

After searching all the Kmart, Wal Mart, Autozone, Advance type places
I finally found pure 85W-90 GL4 made by StaLube at the local Napa store.

It even specifically mentions that it is hypoid rated, which put my mind
at
ease. Check with them first to avoid procurement hassles.

StaLube also sells a pump for $4 that is exactly fits their bottle
(dunno
about others). That little thing is worth $40. GET IT. It will turn a
job that
is disgusting, frustrating, and smelly into a  job that is pleasant,
delightful,
and smelly. If you wait until you get a sinus cold, you can even
minimize
the smelly!

More tips: Take out the fill plug first. You want to be sure you can get
fluid
back in before draining the old. Also, dishwashing gloves might keep the

nasty stink from lingering on you hands.

Yikes!

I just checked the archives and now I am shakin' in my Birks. It seems
the
GL5 that was put in my tranny about 400 miles ago is apt to eat up the
synchros. A prudent person would run out tomorrow and search for GL4
rated
gear oil but this might prove to be a chore based on the previous post.
I
feel I must take action.
