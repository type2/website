&gt; Can someone recommend a good VW machine shop in the Portland, OR area?
I'm
&gt; tentatively going to have my heads rebuilt, and probably hand my
crakshaft,
&gt; camshaft, case, etc. over to someone who knows what they're doing.  This
is
&gt; my first rebuilt, so a very friendly shop (who can help me decide what
&gt; needs to be replaced) would be nice.
