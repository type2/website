Subject: [T2] $300 New German Side Tents and Awnings

It's the end of the year and I have a few brand new German Bus tents to move.

To keep me from paying taxes on the inventory, and the fact that I have more 
tents on order, I'm offering these tents to the list at a very good savings 
off the website pricing.

#90088  Andria Bus Tent was $350, now $300
#90077  Nizza II Bus Tent was $495 now $395
#90078  Tourmobil Side Tent was $400 now $325

I have a few of each currently in stock.  I will wait a few a couple of days 
before offering reduced pricing on the web site.  These prices are for list 
members only, so you must request the pricing.

I also have a few Sunsail awnings.
#90032 Sunsail 2 was $152.95, now $100.00
#90034 Sunsail 3 was $174.95, now $125.00

I also have one used Nizza II that was setup at a few show and events and 
rented out for a couple of weeks.  It is in very good shape but has some 
soiling.  I will let this tent go for $295.

Shipping is additional and delivery by Christmas should be no problem.  
Please visit the website   http://EuroCampers_dot_com  and email or call to order 
or if you have any questions.
