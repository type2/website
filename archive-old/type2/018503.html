Subject: Valve cover gaskets
Message-ID: &lt;37663B2D.7B868A2C_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

I've seen the archive threads that pertain to leaky valve covers and I now know
what I must do to get them tight - concensus being clean, flat surfaces with maybe
a little gasket goo on the valve cover side and use vaselene, grease or oil on
the cork type gasket.

So having bodged it once do I have to get a new gasket and start from scratch or
can I re-use the one I put in 100 miles ago? I know they're not expensive, I'm not 
being cheap, it's just not easy to get to the parts store and I need it fixed very 
soon.

Cheers,



Cosmo
