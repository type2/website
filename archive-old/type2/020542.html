[...]A gasless welder is by definition not a MIG welder (MIG = Metal - 
Inert Gas).  I've never tried gasless, but I've owned a 110V MIG for 
many years.  It works well for all kinds of projects, and makes very 
clean, splatter-free welds under the proper conditions (i.e., surfaces 
to be welded are clean, and the wind is not blowing away your shield 
gas).  Some of the gasless welders offer an optional gas conversion kit, 
but from what I've seen, you're better off buying a true MIG (i.e., 
equipped for gas) unit to begin with. 

I would be wary of the real cheapies.  A common problem with wire feed 
welders is &quot;birdnesting&quot;, where the wire, which is pushed through the 
guide tube by the feed roller, bunches up due to excess friction in the 
guide tube.  That's the last thing you need when you're trying to get 
something done.  Also, pay attention to the duty cycle rating of the 
unit.  Some are only 20%, which means that, on average, you can only 
have the arc struck for 20% of the time the unit is in use.  For small 
jobs and tack welding, that's not going to be an issue, but when you're 
running a continuous long bead, it can be a major problem.  Mine is 
rated 80% at the low heat setting, and it has worked fine.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; . I was looking at the
&gt;&gt; sears gasless 80 amp mig welder. Any opinions on this welder? I have
&gt;&gt; never seen or used one myself.  It's main purpose will be to replace or
&gt;&gt; repair a few panels on my bus and for future tinkering
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Adequate for tinkering- if that's all you ever want to do....
&gt; However, once you start welding, the projects escalate very rapidly,
&gt; and a toy welder is not going to do it. the gasless mig makes big splatter,
&gt; nasty unprofessional welds, and requires the flux-core wire in expensive small
&gt; spools. Go to a local welding supply where they sell equipment and ask for
&gt; a demonstration ( they will let you try the machine) . you will soon see the difference.
&gt; You don't need 220v. equipment for bus projects, and it isn't very portable.
&gt; Try 110 v. welders, with and without inert gas.Thank the man, and then go buy it
&gt; at Harbor Freight .
