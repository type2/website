The Detmar is a brand name. I think you can find them at Boat US. They have
a web site, but I do not have the link handy.

Scott,  I found this very interesting and sounds like a deal compared to
J.C. Whitney.  I found a web site selling the Attwood Turbo fans for $17.95.
Thanks.  I do have on question.  I can't find any information on the Detmar.
Is it a product of Attwood?  Is that the manufacturer name? I'd like to live
in a heated wind tunnel.
