Hi all:

     As I was chipping off a bit of surface rust from my bus, I decided to
be
 thorough and sand the area down to metal. What I found was the edge of what
 I fear is a huge patch-o-bondo. This launched a whole bunch of paranoid
 thoughts like how much of that stuff is my bus made of and how much rust is
 beneath it. I also began to think of how much $$$ the repair bills could
 climb to. I am not a rich man so I have had to learn to do it myself when
it
 comes to just about everything. My questions are: Has anyone tried to use
 one of those little 110v &quot;mity-mite&quot; arc welders that are available? I
 realize that mig set ups are preferable for body work, but I thought maybe
 one of those little things might be wimpy enough to do the job fairly well.
 Also, while I'm at it I thought I might try to learn to paint as well. I
saw
 a airless sprayer for sale and wondered if those things were suitable for
 bus work. Any responses would be greatly appreciated.

     By the way, I just installed an electronic ignition unit in my bus and
tuned
 and timed it to the best of my ability and it seems that my ability isn't
so
 great. It idles perfectly and runs well (decent power and much improved
fuel
 economy) but when I accelerate from a stop, the engine bogs down and almost
 stalls (It will stall if I push the pedal down too fast, especially on a
 hill). Adjustments to the accelerator pump have not help, so I'm hoping
some
 one on the list can. The carb is a 34Pict3 with a .009 distributor.

Thanks in advance,
