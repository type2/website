Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

&gt;&gt; You can use starting fluid on a diesel, but you must have a starting fluid
&gt;&gt; injection kit on the engine. Just squirting it into the air intake from a
&gt;&gt; can, like you do on a gas engine, will blow the engine up.
&gt;
&gt;??? I owned a bus company and we had up to 17 buses, it gets pretty cold
&gt;around these parts and we used cases of starting fluid all winter and we
&gt;just sprayed it into the air cleaner.   never did damage any of those old
&gt;Detroit's that I'm aware of.  and these were &quot;MY&quot; buses so I didn't want
&gt;em damaged as I would have to pay for the repair.

You can punch a 2&quot; hole in a VW 15/1600 diesel piston using ether as
starting fluid.  On Bob's big ole Detroit diesel's maybe not, but it isn't
wise for most car diesels.  There is a wonderfully safe alternative, WD-40
will start and run a VW diesel quite nicely, ideally a warm can of WD-40
that aerosolizes well but not critical.  In high school I drove the '76 bus or
a '78 diesel Rabbit with about 250k miles on it, in WV in the winter WD-40
or a hill were my best friends.  And on real cold nights at 1:00 am after
closing at Ponderosa there was always getting a friend to bumper me
around the parking lot till I could start it when I ran out of the WD-40 or
didn't want to stand outside in the 30mph wind.
