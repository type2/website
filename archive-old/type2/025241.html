I finally broke down and pulled the two broken off oil pump studs on my own
(UPS shipping damage).  I had tried a &quot;ez-out&quot; before but I couldn't figure
it out... this time I hammered the ez-out into the hole I drilled, that was
the ticket!  Came out easy, of course, as these are brand new studs with no
rust or wear.

Anyway -- Now I'm trying to complete my engine parts list before I start to
put it all together.  I'm going with new Bosch alternator, Dual Kadrons...
I'm not using a previous engine to transfer parts, so I'm collecting new.
Already have the complete alternator parts, plus a oil pump stand.

Question 1 -- Distributor drive gear?
I know I need to install something to put my distributor in.  The Tom Wilson
book shows installing the drive gear with the engine split.  My questions
are pretty simple -- do VW FLAPS sell the parts I need new, and what is the
general cost?  Is the FLAPS going to give me a choice in size, and anything
that a new 1600CC DP that could possibly get confused?  I could go get a
used part, but I'd rather stick with new parts...

Question 2 -- Fuel Pump?
Ok, I've purchased fuel pumps before.  But I presume to start from a scratch
long block I also need a pump rod and a stand piece.  Anything else to be
aware of.  ((As an aside, I'm pretty close to deciding that the stock
&quot;alternator style&quot; round fuel pump should drive my dual Kadrons.  I've had a
few comment that it should without problem.  Anyone have other comments to
throw at me?))

P.S.  Going to Comdex / Las Vegas Sunday - Wednesday AM.  Any good VW FLAPS
or junk yards within reason?
