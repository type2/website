Subject: Re: [T2] re:decibel - ANC

I did not realized how noisy was my bus before reading this thread ! 
just kidding !!!
When I initially planned to change my car stereo and the 4 speakers , I 
change the front ones only,  arguing that changing  the back ones will 
just allow me to add even more noise to cover the rest.
I kind of remember about ANC (active Noise-canceling) , a quick google 
search showed that solutions exist out there, they even have ANC for 
mufflers. Maybe its time to decorate our bus with Mics ;-)

I was wondering if anyone has experience with this technology  ?
