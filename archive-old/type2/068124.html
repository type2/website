Subject: Taking action on a 'sermon'.

After reading one the sermons of Mr Hoover (You know, the alarming one
about VW's fuel pipe fracturing at the engine bulkhead and 'Brewing
up'),
I have spent many an innocent hour contemplating a pass-through for my
bus. And I think I have cracked it! (The pass-through not the fuel
line!) 

By taking a straight-through compression joint used for micro-bore
plumbing systems, and filing down the central nut, hey presto, a 
brass jobby like wot Bob described.

However, since my bus is in cold storage for the winter. (OK, OK cringe
if you like, but I love my bus and she deserves better than being made
to drive around in the nasty cold!) I'm not sure of the clearance 
between the bulkhead and fuel tank, just how much room do I have to 
play with?

(Blimey, things must be slow at work for me to draw that!)

Regards Simon.
