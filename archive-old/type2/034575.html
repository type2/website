Yes Nikki.  Cindy and I will come.
Any Type II gathering would be fun!
It's about time for a mid winter campout.
And Steve would make a great key note speaker!

	Attention SoCal bussers!

	The esteemed H. Steve Dolan is coming to L.A. over the weekend of
Jan.
	15 &amp; 16 and I thought I'd throw together a gathering for any listees
who
	would like to meet him. 

	Having absolutely *no* idea of the level of interest in an event
like
	this (i.e., how many people would show up), I'm not sure whether to
	invite y'all over to my humble abode, have it at a park, or possibly
	some other venue.

	So, couldja let me know if you'd be interested in getting together,
so I
	can solidify some plans for this? It would be Saturday, January
15th. I
	know it's kinda short notice, but I'd appreciate your input.

	Nikki

	P.S. I guess I should post this to the vintage and vanagon lists,
too.
	How do I do that?
