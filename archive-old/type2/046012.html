:

&lt;&lt; I find your comments about her offensive.
  &gt;&gt;

    All right, before I get lynched all my comments were tongue in cheek and 
many based on Nikki's own observations. So let it be known that Nikki and I 
are friends &lt;gulp&gt; and I was happy that it was her that was able to save 
another bus from the crushers. Let it further be known that we all, SO, kids 
and Nikki spent most of the day making sure the bus was transported safety 
and followed that up with A&amp;W floats on the way home to have a nice dinner. 
My son has decided that Nikki is his girlfriend, so in a way, she has already 
been taken home to mom. Okay put down the rope!
