Subject: Welder needed SF/Sacramento Area

Dear Bus Folks:

I apologize in advance for a slightly off-topic post.  It's not by 
Bus or my Benz that needs the welding, it's my wife's F*rd Crown Vic 
Interceptor.

She really loves this car but it got a slight crack in the 
undercarriage behind the rear wheel.  A cross-bar which was 
spot-welded to the main frame rail unwelded itself.  The frame rail 
itself is solid, it's a CA car with no rust.

You folks know (in my opinion) all there is to know about busses and 
cars in general.  I'll go up to two hours from Sacramento in any 
direction if I can get this fixed.  The car drives fine but two 
mechanics here in Davis gave it &quot;last rites&quot;.  And no, she WON'T buy 
a VW or another Benz.  I've tried that.

All suggestions helpful.  Metal Wiz, do you have a relative out here?

Thanks,

BEN
