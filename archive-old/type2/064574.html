Dave,

Because they are always moving up and down through thinner and thicker
air, airplane drivers routinely adjust the leaness/richness 
of their aircraft engines with altitude, and its often done with
the aid of an EGT gauge. The rule of thumb is to lean to the
peak temperature, then richen it up so that it is about
50 degrees below peak. 

If you used your CHT, I wonder if this would be a valid way
to figure out the proper jetting for a consistent driving 
altitude.

Just a thought,

Tom F.
