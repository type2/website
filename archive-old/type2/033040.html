&gt;1. Could someone please decipher what year engine I have. The number is
&gt;CB056530.

I'm fairly positive that's a 1700cc manual transmission motor from a 72 bus

&gt;2. On the back of the mounting stand their is a place for the brake booster
&gt;line, mine is currently under the bus not hooked up. Should I hook this
&gt;brake booster line back up?

most definitely. If you don't, you'll have a harder time braking and potential for vacuum leaks.
I would probably replace the entire hose  (with steel reinforced vacuum line - the VW line is costly though)
unless you're sure its solid, and also install a new one-way air check in-line to prevent backfiring from
blowing the seals in your brake servo.

&gt;4. I had a hard time finding a local FLAPS that had spark plug wires, I did
&gt;find a set for $30.00 does that sound right, expensive. The lines didn't
&gt;match perfect to the ones I took off but didn't know if this would be a
&gt;problem. Will this cause any problems?

I prefer to order only bosch wires and wait for them to come from the VW shop. I've had
problems with FLAPS wires in the past, including one not seating properly causing the motor
to run on 3 cylinders and overheat, or having the wire come loose from the plug connector.
Good Luck!
