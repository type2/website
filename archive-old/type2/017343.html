Tony:
A 911 tranny is certainly an intriguing idea, but I'm not sure it's
worth the work.
Plusses:
1. 5-speeds
2. All ratios and ring and pinions changeable (at enormous expense)
3. Durable
Minuses:
1. The mounts don't fit
2. The shift linkage doesn't fit
3. The c-v joints are different
4. The ratios are more ideally suited to a peaky, racing engine,than a
torquey, truck engine like is preffered in a type 2
5. Enormously expensive to repair.(typically $1000 range to overhaul)
You do the math
