Subject: Re: [T2] better'n bondo

Gentlepersons-
                       Not that I'm defending spending huge amounts of 
money...But how many
Duesenberg generators (or for that matter, Duesenbergs) are there? As opposed 
to
say Delco's or SS 396's. Besides, the build quality of either IS a 
world-apart. Ever see
a Doozie engine in the metal? Even the crankshafts were specially machined 
with egg-
shaped bearing surfaces to allow for flexing...
                       It's hard to understand that kind of dedication in a 
mass market world
and probably harder to justify the cost since after all, both the Doozie and 
a type 2 have
the same raison d'etre...going from point a to point b, but then again a 
Kodak Brownie
and a Lieca both take pictures...
Tony in NJ who wishes he had a (no not a Doozie), but one of Adrian Squire's 
self-named
roadsters...
