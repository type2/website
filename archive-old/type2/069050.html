Subject: Re: Pop-Top Question;67

Hey, I have a question similar to this posting...

 
&gt; Folks: 
&gt;       Did the early  square, small &quot;euro style&quot; pop tops 
use the 
&gt;factory sunroof hole? Reason I ask is we have one of these
&gt;pop tops, but it seems our van is not a westy-it has a vinyl
&gt;headliner (original by looks) and no other camping stuff
&gt;(There are some strangenesses, though.). The poptop isn't a
&gt;hack job, though. The hole is obviously factory: pressed in
&gt;lip like the opening for one of my Reneault R5 fabric
&gt;sunroof holes. Did we get someone's camper conversion 
&gt;project? Could a sunroof be retrofitted to this opening? 
&gt;&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;       Thanks &amp;  _Have fun_
&gt;       Chris and Buffy 
&gt;

My Question is thus;

I have a '71 Westy with the front-hinged camper top.  
Previously I had a '73 with the popular non-westy conversion. 
 I have heard these referred to as &quot;Riviera conversions.&quot;
They are the type that pop straight up with the roof rack 
portion in front.  I preferred this set up.  (I hear y'all 
gasping and moaning with horror)  What I want to know is, If 
I can find one of these Tops....  How much hassle would it be 
to replace my Westy lid?  I don't want to swap the guts out 
just the top.  My guess is that the actual cut-out portioin 
of the roof is the same, and thus the swap should at least be 
within the realm of possibility.  Shoot me down or tell me 
you've done it yourself and send the blueprints!
