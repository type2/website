Subject: initial start up!

well, started the kreeper this afternoon. sounds a little different than
my last motor but sounds good. seems like it ran a little rough. ran it
for about 15 minutes, then drained oil-nothing to speak of in the oil.
the place that built the motor (vw paradise) is going to do a free
inspection of timing and installation-make sure everything looks ok and
to validate the warranty! mind your P's and Q's thank-you! going to run
the drill- 300 miles and check heads,  valves etc. crossing my fingers
that this keeps me off the concrete and in the drivers seat a little
more often! not that i dont enjoy working on my bus, its just that in
the past week, ive spent probably 30 hours or so getting this thing
together....whew! anyway i hope everybody has a safe and happy new year!
