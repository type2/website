Subject: Re: [T2] Alternate Engine Removal Procedure

Here is where the 2&quot; x 10&quot; comes in handy, even if the HEs are not 
installed. Get it in there on the board. Raise one side, add a brick under 
the board, lift the other side add a brick. Go back to the first side and 
repeat until you have enough clearence to get it above the jack.

When I did my last one this is what we used to get it of the creeper that 
the 2&quot; x 10&quot; was centered in.

&gt;2.) If I set that engine on the ground to slide it under the bus I have
&gt;serious doubts of my ability to get it lifted high enough to get it back on
&gt;the jack without help. I've managed to get seriously out of shape working a
&gt;job where I sit on my butt 17 hours/day. I've started rectifying that with
&gt;excersize but it will be a long slow process.
