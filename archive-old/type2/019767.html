Subject: re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

This happens to me all the time. Mine is an old beat up primer grey '67,
dent in the front, no bumpers, chrome wheels, beads, etc. This morning
at McD's a kid asked me if that was my &quot;van&quot; outside. Yup, I told him.
That's tight, very cool, he told me...

A couple of times I've been approached by police officers, which of
course caused a heart rate increase (yeah, I'm one of those old skool
bus drivers). One of them said, &quot;Cool ride!&quot;. The other one proceeded to
tell me of a '73 he has in his back yard that he's trying to fix up...
