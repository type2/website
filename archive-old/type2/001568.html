Greetings...

Quick question..  I have a 71 camper w/ a 1600 dp engine.  Everything is
stock as far as I can tell.

I believe I have a sticky oil control valve.  This is the spring loaded
piston that is located on the left front bottom of the engine block (FIF).
Closest to the #3 cylinder.  This is different from the similar valve that
is on the rear right bottom of the engine, next to #2 cylinder...  If this
was sticking, would this prevent oil from getting to the oil cooler, hence
oil that is too hot all the time...?

Or better yet, what role does this valve play in the oil system of my
engine?

It is my hunch that my oil temps are so high because not enough oil is
getting to the oil cooler, or getting cooled by the oil cooler.

Thoughts?
