Subject: Carb Problems
Mime-Version: 1.0


A good weekend to all,

Well I have my new choke element installed and now the carb wishes to 
backfire (or make popping noises and spits as into the choke element.  If I 
disconnect the power source for the element the backfiring, and gas spitage 
stops.  Can anyone give me a clue as what I may have done wrong or what is 
wrong?  Oh the carb is the 34pict.


Thanks,
Mike
