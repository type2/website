Subject: [T2] rear bearing nut

OK I just managed to borrow a 46 mm socket and 3/4 inch drive, though it's
going to need a bit of an extension.

Before I do myself an injury, can anybody confirm which way I have to turn
the nut on the right hand side of the bus, to get it off. I know some
commercial vehicles have anticlockwise threads on wheel nuts, so might this
apply here?
