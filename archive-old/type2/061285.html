Subject: Engine Mounting Bolts

Anyone know the size the 3 bolts that hold the engine onto the engine
mount/support beam? It's a pain because I've got to take off the muffler to get
at them and I'd like to buy them before I take the muffler off so I don't have
to drive around with no muffler.

I had my chains on going up to Cypress mountain snowboarding. I only had two of
these bolts to start with and one of them sheared of while I was driving up the
hill.  I think the rattleing from the chains did it.

On the way home I noticed that it was even harder to get into 1st gear than
normal and also that there was  suddenly a  massive exaust leak. I adjusted the
shifter plate and went 'round back for a look at the muffler. Then I notice that
the  engine is tilted over leaning heavily to the left. Not good.

Thanks for your help
