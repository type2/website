Subject: Thanks for the JINX clutch cable posters!

So the pickup crapped out and I wasn't able to finish
all the projects on the bus. Today was second day of
driving Bussy and about half way to work the clutch
cable broke. I considered driving in sans clutch
release but decided that since I carry a spare and
there was a nice big freeway overpass I could park
under, I'd give it a try. There's always AAA if I need
to, also.

The biggest problem was cutting the last two strands
off as some of my tools didn't make it back into the
tool box after the recent cooling system work. Once
that was accomplished, the old cable was out and the
new in, and even with stopping at 7-11 on the way, I
was only twenty minutes late for work!

Big problem is that for every symptom there is an
underlying cause and the broken cable was merely a
symptom! The engine's coming out this weekend.

Oh - Trucklet? His fuel filter was so clogged that I
couldn't blow through it without a tremendous effort.
New filter and hopefully I'll get a couple more weeks
out of him so I can do Bussy right this time.

Does that mean re-working the plumbing? Maybe. It
might even mean installing engine #2 but I really am
not ready for that. The engine's ready - I just don't
have the new motor mounts worked out yet or the
transaxle rebuilt. I can't decide between two
transaxles that I have ready - guess I'll have to pull
them both apart and see which is better or less
badder! Daylight Saving time couldn't come at a more
opportune time! -BaH
