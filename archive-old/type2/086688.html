The small blue wire connects to the connector you describe there should be
anothe rsimilar guaged blue wire for it to connect to.  This wire runs
eventually to the idiot light for your charging system on the dash.

&gt; On the right side of the engine, there is a plastic sheath of wires that
&gt; come up through the engine tin (right above the mustache bar), it looks
like
&gt; it may be the wires to the alternator.  The wires fork, one set going to
a plug
&gt; that appears to belong to the voltage regulator, and then there is 1
single
&gt; heavy gauge wire (red) that has been cut-off.  I assume that this wire
goes
&gt; to the + side of the battery, sound correct?

If it's the wire I'm thinking about, it actually goes to the starter.
The other wire w/ the plug sounds correct about going to the reg.

&gt; Then, from the voltage regulator plug, there is a short wire (blue if I
remember correctly) that goes to a small plastic connector, sorta looks
like 1 side of an in-line fuse connector but rectangular, any idea what
this connects to?
&gt;

If no one else knows exactly what this goes to, I can check my bus
(79) later and try and see where it goes on mine.
