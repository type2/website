Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

&gt; I am deathly afraid of low oil pressure especially here in the
 115 degree heat of southern Arizona.  In my
 experience, the oil light on an aircooled bus
 doesn't flicker until a split second before a rod
 flies through your aluminum or magnesium case.

In my thermal accident last summer, my oil light came on at 280
degrees, about 3000 rpm at about 55 mph (62 panel, 1776 motor).
Valvoline 20-50 SR-1 Racing Oil. Very hot day, probably over 100
degrees. I find the motor very resilient and have had no trouble with
it.

&gt; You guys with oil pressure gauges, what have you
&gt; noticed with respect to thinner oils versus
&gt; straight weights?

You are supposed to have 10 psi per 1000 rpm. The 20-50 oil gives me
this pressure perfectly when warmed up. I am still way to high when
cold.

&gt; Another factor in fuel economy is temporary
&gt; polymer shear. These polymers are additives known
&gt; as viscosity index improvers (or modifiers).

True synthetic oil has less dependence on these molecules and in my
mind is the best answer to many of these problems. I will be switching
as soon as my current stocks are depleted.
