Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell metering

&gt; I have been reading the archives trying to see if I can understand the mistery around settings points with a dwell meter, and by now (but still looking) I have three quiestion I must ask in order to gethe whole picture.
&gt;
&gt; 1. To take a reading from the dwwell meter the engine must be running, just cranked or it is the same ?
running.

&gt;
&gt; 2. Can I using a Volt/Ohm meter set the points of my 6V with a reading of 3.35V ?
I dont know where you got that # but the correct dwell will have a
corresponding DC Voltage.

&gt; 3. I found in the archives that somebody uses a Volt/Ohm meter to static time the bus, How could do that ?
You could use the voltmeter in place of a light to see when to points
open.
