Hi Mark


This sounds like a good idea. But unfortunately on mine, despite a new
sender I still have the problem that when I fill up, letting the pump keep
going until it cuts off, it still doesn't reach the full mark. No doubt
somebody will have a method for bending the float on the sender so it reads
higher, but I'm not looking to go back into the tank just yet. Do we have
any electrical adjustments or can the needle be set mechanically to go to
full on the dial?

Theres a bias resistor which I think is used for smoothing out the readings
as you're sloshing the fuel around the tank whilst you're driving along the
road. Perhaps a different value here might make a difference?

Alternatively, is it that whatever mechanism they have on the gas pumps to
ensure that the tank doesn't overflow is a bit nervous and cutting off
prematurely. I remember some time back, I used to go to some pumps and they
would spill over onto the ground, but this seemed to cure itself once I'd
had the tank out, replaced the sender unit and cleaned the crap out.
