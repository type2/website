Subject: fuel tank partitions on commercials

hi - this goes out to all, especially the pick-up owners. i am seeking the
gas tank partitions. mine are way rusted out, and to make matters worse the
PO, for some unknown reason, cut 3-4&quot; holes in them. not having a
firewall...that's noisy. seems single or doublecab partitions will do. any
extras on your parts pick up? BIGthanks, steve
