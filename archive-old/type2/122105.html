Subject: what thermostat!?

When I had my oil light problem _at_ 2 months ago, one thing I read was to 
check the thermostat and make sure it wasn't jammed or stuck. Turns out it 
was just the sensor wire grounding against something.  After repeated 
attempts to find the thermostat I realised, quite certainly, that I don't 
have one.  I'm not sure about the flaps - I didn't see any pictures of 
flaps, so I couldn't be sure. I remember there was no thermostat bracket, 
thermostat, or cable. I found the holes where it should have been mounted. 
High level impact assesment: Ok, Bad, Really Bad?

I don't have a temp or oil temp gauge, just lights ('78 bus). I drive it 3 
seasons, in New Hampshire.
Which, by the way, was -17 by our kitchen thermometer at 6 a.m. when I took 
the dog out for a walk. I don't know how he doesn't even notice the 
difference........

Thanks
Mat
