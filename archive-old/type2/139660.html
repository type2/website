Subject: Re: [T2] ACCUFIRE electronic ignition 

David,

I've had nothing but *good* customer service from them.  Example:

Had a 2 week old turn signal switch fail on me...e-mailed them and got and
answer back in less than 1 hour...the only question back was &quot;where do you 
want us to send you a new one?&quot;

They didn't even want me to ship the old one back.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Cip.  I have heard bad customer service stories with them.
