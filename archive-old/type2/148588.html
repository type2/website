Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

Hi,

The steering wheel is off. Much of the plastic around the horn and the
bottom side of the wheel is already chipped off. Looks like a PO tried
the puller method unsuccessfully.

Once I found something big enough to get loose the M18 bolt (a friend
had a 1-1/16th socket in his jeep) all I did was:

Spray a squirt of PB Blaster around the splines.
Slam on the nut with a BFH while pulling straight up on the steering wheel.

and off it came. Much easier than pulling at 3-9 oclock and 6-12
oclock. That wasn't getting me anywhere.

Now, suggestion for removing a circlip without the necessary tools? I
figure maybe I can do it with some small screwdrivers.

Thanks
Jules
