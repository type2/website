Andrew,

Sometimes you just draw a blank :-)  

As I said (I think), when I did this job on the '76 and '78, the arm type
was stock and still available, so that's what I used, but the column type
is supposed to work, and is supposed to be less subject to fluctuations as
you round corners.  &lt;in his best Bronx accent&gt; Ya' pays yer money, ya'
takes yer chances :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
