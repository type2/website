Be skeptical.  A well-working stock L-Jetronic FI is a great little 
system.  I also think it's a bit easier to work on than dual 
carburetors.

As Richard said, there is not much vertical clearance in a Vanagon 
engine compartment for dual carburetors.  Similar problem as the Type 3 
cars had.  There are dual-carb kits for Type 3 cars, but I don't think 
those manifolds will fit the Type 4 engine.  They still might not 
provide proper clearance.

Besides, it's not at all clear that you could pass a smog test with 
carburetors instead of FI.  I don't know if they do those up there in 
Washington, but there's enough hand-wringing with just the stock FI 
down here in California :-)

If you want more power and a better-running / more efficient engine, I 
would consider other things, and rule out getting rid of the FI:

1. Install an electronic ignition if your engine does not already have 
one (did all of the Vanagon air-cooled have electronic ignition, or 
just the California models?).  Pertronix is a good unit ... I know 
several (including me :-) who are happy with theirs.  Compufire is 
another alternative.

2. Consider a CDI ignition, with a high-energy coil, wires, and 
high-performance plugs (don't forget to use a wider-than-stock plug 
gap).  This may also have the nice side-effect of improving your fuel 
economy (this is the primary reason that I am considering such a 
system).
