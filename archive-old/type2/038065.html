Subject: Engine Rebuilders

Hey all,

In the shopping mode for a rebuilt engine, my mechanic has used and
suggested Strictly Foreign in Grants Bend, Oregon.  Any one know of them
or have good or bad experiences?  I am also considering Mark Stephens,
based on the feedback I have seen on the list.  Someone had recently
posted about a guy he used on Long Island which he was very pleased
with.  Does anyone have that info?  It is not in the archives yet.  Any
one want to suggest another to consider?  I am on the East Coast in New
Hampshire.
