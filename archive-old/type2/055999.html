Subject: Campout

Hey Daniel-
I went to type2_dot_com and found that their interior decorator had left
the place in shambles. The home page doesn't have a link(that I could
find) for this campout. Could you please give me the address to your
page with the info, and an address(snail) to send the money. Please
send me that specific page's address... not your home page, as it must
have some incredible graphics that out do my patience(I left the
computer for a ½hr once, still didn't load). I have not as of yet
committed to going, but will send money in hopes. It is somewhat
dependent upon my newest Westy, the old one just refuses to go.
 Cheers,
    -Kent
