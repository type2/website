My local flaps gave me a 555G instead of the 555D which was the right one
for a 68. I should have known when he was fumbling around. I tried it
anyway and I think the only diff is that it has an eye at the forward end
instead of the offset bit that I expected length is fine. I used a bolt w
2 nuts (for lockdown) and it works fine.
cheers
