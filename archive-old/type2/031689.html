&gt; I have one question----
&gt; The Bentley says that with an automatic trans., the engine can be

&gt; In the VW repair manual, it says that the trans. has to come out with
&gt; the engine.
&gt; Which is true?

Bentley  (however Bentley is the VW repair manual) 

I have a 78 Automatic and routinely remove my engine without touching the
tranny.   be warned though this is one heavy engine..  also there are a
few things on the automatic engine that are not on the manual that have to
be done.

. the tranny fluid fill tube must be removed
. the accelerator linkage is different and is attached to the tranny. it
must be disconected at the throttle body and taken apart it can easily be
bent in removeing the engine.
. if you have an early (73-75) auto tranny there is some vacuum tubing to
the tranny
. you have to remove the coil, trust me you have to remove the coil
&gt; 
&gt; I would like for this to be a one time job, so I am going to do the best
&gt; for the engine that I can in using the high dollar valves, and seats.( I
&gt; wanted titanium valves but they are really big denaro's )

it was suggested and I went with Diesel valve seats, swaged in place
