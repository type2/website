Thought some one might like this....

One of the best surf/travel stories I've ever heard about was one that
was
in Surfer (U.S.) magizine about 20 years ago (Severeson?);

Some surfers were safaring down in mainland Mexico.  They stayed at a
remote
fising village.  The inhabitants of the village lived next to the Ocean
adjacent to a river mouth.  This area was known to produce some good
waves.
Unfortunally for the surfers, the fishermen would throw away the
remnants of
the days catch(fish guts) into the river , thus attracting sharks.  No
problem.

After a couple of days of surfing areas close by (still to afraid to
surf
this area due to the rep for sharks) they thought they might try this
spot
the next day.  Unfortunally the swell died.  Being bored surfers that
they
were, one of them came up with the idea to go fishing for the local
sharks
in the river mouth. The only problem they had was they did'nt have any
fishing tackle, or a boat.  One of the guys got an idea,  They bought a
chicken in the village (for bait), &amp; borrowed a big hook with rope
attacted
to it.  But how to bring in the shark when in decides  to take the
chicken?
Easy, tie the other end of the rope to their V.W., and put it in reverse
and
drag the shark to shore, no problems!

Well the shark did hit the chicken, the guys did start the bus up, put
it in
reverse, and attempted to bring da bugga in.  The shark had other plans,
it
decided to high tail it to open ocean, chicken, hook, rope,and V.W. bus
and
all.  Much to the terror of the disbeliving surfers, thier only means of
transport was starting to be dragged into the pacific ocean by one
pissed-off shark.  Literally the guy could'nt bring in the shark, and
the
driver had foot gluded to the brake.  Can you imagine the scene!  &quot;What
the
FUCK are we going to do!&quot;.

Well, they were able to cut the rope just before the bus was dragged
into
the big blue.  

Moral of the story, respect Mother Nature! it will kick your ass if you
dont.
