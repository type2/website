All,

Thanks for the info-I have one of these POS in my '69 and didn't know
about *this* particular problem....

One other thing to watch for: the brass (ok, it LOOKS like brass!)
tube fuel-inlet is apparently known to fall out as well!!!!!! YIKES!!! 

My former mechanic showed me a beetle that was in for this very
reason. Apparently, the driver was in 5:00 rush hour traffic when he
smelled a strong fuel odor. He did what he thought sensible; DROVE IT
TO THE MECHANIC!!!! He didn't pull over....didn't bother to check
anything, he just pushed on! 

I might add that it was about 90 degrees outside at the time and
sitting in traffic, on HOT pavement, the fuel could have easily hit
flash-point and....well, you get the picture!!

In the process of driving to the mechanic, this *very* lucky fellow
had to cross a draw-bridge (this was in Portland, Or.)...if the car
had caught on fire at that critical moment..............!

Anyway, I used to keep bailing wire twined around my carb and inlet
AFTER I pounded it in with a 5# sledgehammer (and yes, it moved a good
1/8&quot; when hammered!), but this carb just &lt;loves&gt; to be rebuilt, so the
wire went away.

I guess next rebuild (carb, that is) time, I'll do a more permanent
repair.

&gt; I'm sure that this has been discussed before; but it seems worth
another
&gt; posting.
&gt; 
&gt; STORY:
&gt; Earlier this week, I was called upon to help a friend who's '71
standard
&gt; beetle wasn't running well, and finally couldn't start.  Lifting the
&gt; hatch immediatly displayed the problem: the plug on the rear (rear is
&gt; rear) of the 'universal' replacement carb (30/31 PICT, Brosol, Brazil)
&gt; had defeated the three flimsy peans used to hold it in place and had
&gt; popped out and disappeared.  So I carefully ground down a dime a mm or
&gt; two all around and peaned it in place.  Yesterday, I had just picked
up
&gt; a passenger at the airport and was starting up my '71 bus when I got a
&gt; funny little backfire and terrible idle.  Lifting the hatch, what
did I
&gt; see but the same problem.  This time, the plug was to be found off to
&gt; the right side of the engine compartment, and I was able to pean it
back
&gt; in place with a tire iron and a hiking book (courtesy of my amused
&gt; passenger).
&gt; 
&gt; MORAL:
&gt; If you have one of these carbs, pean that plug better, ASAP.
