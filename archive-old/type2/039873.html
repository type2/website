&gt; Well, h_at_ll. I've got three other settings on my cute little multimeter
&gt; from Radio Shack: a little arrow, a K(omega), and CONT. I tried it on
&gt; all of them, and got a zero reading on each. Is that good news, or am I
&gt; doing something wrong?

the little arrow is probably a diode checker.
K(omega) means kilohms or thousands of ohms.  It should read zero when the
probe tips are together and infinity when they are apart.
CONT means continuity, basically a way of checking whether there is a
complete circuit.  It should read differently when the leads are apart or
together.

All of these settings are made to be used on unenergized circuits.  If
you've tried them on a powered circuit, you've probably blown the meter.
