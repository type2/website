&gt;  Took my bus on my first trip--about 120 miles, everything went
&gt;  perfectly. I had a few problems downshifting into second--wouldn't go in
&gt;  until vehicle speed was about 10 mph.
&gt;  
&gt;  About 60 miles into the return trip I either lost all my gears or got
&gt;  stuck in 3rd. Not liking any of my alternatives vis-a-vis towing/rescue,
&gt;  I opted to drive home in 3rd gear. A new clutch is probably in the stars
&gt;  for me.
&gt;  
&gt;  Judging from the archives, it sounds like something rather simple has
&gt;  gone amiss inside the nosecone. (There is a fairly healthy oil leak
&gt;  there now, it seems.) But before I pull engine and tranny, what should I
&gt;  be inspecting? Is there something I should be looking at closer to the
&gt;  shifter?
&gt;  
&gt;  

I had the same happen to me - choice of third gear or press the clutch - 
unfortunately I was nose first into a blind alley at the time so had to be 
towed out backwards with my foot on the clutch.

Those in the know all surmised that the selector carrier had broken inside 
the nose cone - its about 150mm long with a 15mm upright on each end and 
about 15mm across  (a long flat bar with the ends bent up to make a long flat 
U shape).

This selector is (so I'm told by those in know) a weak point in the system; 
in 74 or 75 VW changed the design the used two U shaped bars the second about 
1/2 the length which made the selection mechanism stronger.

I sourced a selector carrier from a VW gearbox specialist picked at 'random' 
&gt;from one of the UK VW magazines. Then pulled the gear box.
When the nose cone was removed the carrier wasn't broken!

A part that was badly worn was the rubber grommet that sits in the 'eye' at 
the top of the selector arm. The end of shift rod inside of the nose cone is 
bent to a hockey stick shape the curved end going into the hole in the 
grommet.

It was surmised (the linkage mechanism with only one selector carrier tends 
to fall apart when the nose cone is removed, and it did on mine) that the 
hockey stick had come out of the grommet. So it was put back together with a 
new grommet (sourced from the same VW gearbox specialist) and I had no 
further problems.

As the gearbox was out I also took the opportunity to replace the 
'shuttle-cock' bushings inside of the shift rod tube - if the box is out its 
a good move as 20 years of use will have worn them out.

Good luck
