alot of people have requested some info on the bus so here you guys go:

Here are the best stats on the bus that I can provide right now.  I live in
Puyallup, Washington (that is about an hour away from Seattle).  When I got
the bus the owners gave up on it because they couldnt figure out what was
wrong with it, because the bus just wouldn't start, and after putting a new
starter in it they got fed up with it and sold it to me for $300. I found out
the problem wich was a blown fourth cylinder, so after replacing that and the
alternator the bus worked fine.  It shifts great and ran fine untill something
was wrong with the fuel pump, so we replaced it with a used one from a
junkyard, and the bus worked fine again untill we kept having the problem of
it breaking down when we go up hills.  We try and start it up again and after
awhile it starts, but then breaks down again, and again even if we are on flat
hill.  as for the miles I think there are 300,000 on the engine.  I hope this
answers all your questions on it.  If you have any more dont hesitate to ask,
I am very curious as to what others think.

Thanks ,
Courtney
