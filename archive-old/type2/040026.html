I didn't read the original post, but here is the solution to your stuck
filter problems.  Stabbing the case only works when the case doesn't rip open
and leave you with nothing to grab with a real wrench.

 Go to this site:

I own one of these (got mine from the Snap-On guy, but it's exactly the same)
and I haven't had a problem with a filter since I bought it.  It's well worth
it, and it's not terribly expensive.  I think I paid less than $15.

    You can use it with a 3/8 drive ratchet or a box end wrench.  The tines
on there are just thin enough (and squeeze the filter just enough) to clear
all the tin and junk around it on my 2000 cc.  I don't know how I would
change my filter without it.

Always looking for the swingy table and leg for my westy.
