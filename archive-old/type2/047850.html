Subject: [T2] timing

Hey there.  I've a '73,  T2  that we just picked up for a steal here in
sunny Vancouver, BC.  Brand new paint, orange &amp; white, new bottom
sliding door runner, (good job!), re-contitioned full length roof rack,
and brand new brakes.  The thing drives well and is a lot lighter than
the &quot;76 Westy but here are the problems, with an attempt at being short
winded.
    The engine has a 009 distributor and a parts guy here _at_ Cal. Imports
said the best way to time these things is to put a mark on the pully 1
1/2&quot; to the right (CW) of the timing notch, rev the engine to 3500RPM
(slowly) to engage the CF advance,  and turn the dist. accordingly to
line the new mark to 12o'clock on the case.
    Has anyone here seen or done this to the 009?  I've tried it and at
idle the poor thing backfires to the carb on acceleration and to the
exhaust on deceleration.  So I tried to follow my handy mechanics
tune-up spec book as I have for 15 years on countless other engines and
got a bit of a better reaction from the engine but still backfiring to
the exh. on decel.
    I just replaced the headers and muffler as they were shot (possibly
because of the backfiring).  While under the bus, I noticed the primary?
header coming out of the head (cyl. 3)where attached was loose.  Upon
inspection, I noticed one of the bolts were stripped (great), hence an
exhaust leak.  I haven't a clue how to fix that short of tapping a
larger hole and bigger dia. bolt.
    Would you folks have any advice on the exhaust leak?
    Would that be a possible cause to the backfiring?
    How about timing advice?

Thanks for the great resource here _at_ type2_dot_com  .
