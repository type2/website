Subject: Type 2s ARE reliable

I have to agree with all that William Warburton said. And I have been 
thinking about some of the claims on this list that reinforce the belief 
that buses aren't reliable.

Not one of these claims is anything more that a statement of prejudice! 
They are myths!

There is, for instance, this myth: &quot;Older things are inherently less 
reliable than newer things.&quot; This is obviously not true, and we can see 
that even by comparing buses. The gas filler on buses up to '75, to take 
just one example, was better than the fillers on '76 through '79. 

Of the critical components of a bus, the rates of wear are all very well
known, and replacement schedules are available in black and white. 
Corrosion can be stopped or held in check. The only variable that
correlates with age and not with predictable wear is metal fatigue in some
components. And I think that if you look at just one critical component of
buses -- the body -- type2s give a good accounting of themselves. 

The next myth: &quot;Nothing is perfect; anything can fail and leave you 
stranded.&quot; Sure. But that's a statement about technology, not about any 
particular instance of technology. It has no bearing on whether a bus is 
more or less reliable than any other vehicle.

That, in a nutshell, is the rationale behind this reputation for 
unreliability. It doesn't hold water. Not a drop.

And yet it seems to be undeniable that buses are unreliable. Or is it?

First of all, unreliable compared to what? To vehicles of comparable 
wear? In that case, I think VWs are going to win hands down. I'll bet 
that as a fraction of original production, the number of buses that are 
still roadworthy is way up there on the actuarial tables. To newer 
vehicles? 

The problem here is that you just cannot compare all buses against all 
Volvos or all buses against all Hondas. The most important variable in 
this whole discussion is the maintenance record of a given vehicle.

Here is what I would predict, were we able to find comparison vehicles. 
A Volkswagen bus, maintained according to factory recommendations, and to 
which every needed repair has been promptly executed (including damage to 
body and paint) will have a record of reliability equal to or better than 
any automobile you can think of, contemporary or newer.

Type2 &quot;unreliability&quot; is a stereotype, nothing more.
