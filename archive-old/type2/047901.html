Subject: [T2] choking fuel injected  Westy

Hi everyone-
I'm new to this forum, so please bear with me....On my way home from a 3,000 
mile round trip to Montana, my bus started to kind of choke now and then.  
It seemed exactly like it wouldn't fire for a second, and then pick up and 
keep on going... As I drove it started to get worse and that's about the 
time I pulled over and slept for the night...Anyhow, the next morning it 
wouldn't start--seems very much like it's not getting gas.  After she was 
hauled home (thanks U-Haul, although you definitely screwed me) I checked 
the fuel filter (square one underneath) and that was fine.  I haven't toyed 
with the fuel pump too much, although that is my new suspect.  Does this 
sound familiar to anyone????  Thanks for the help....................Chet
                                         '77 Westy &quot;The Monkey Nugget&quot;
