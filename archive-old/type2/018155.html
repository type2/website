Hey Ya'll 
I'm probably the most excited girl in the history of the world....
I'm pickin' up The Lorax on thursday from the mech. WHH HHOOO
so it's costing me around $2000.00  all parts and labor 
things replaced and worked on are:
windshield
passenger side window
tires
gas tank grommits
brakes
rotors
wheel cyl.
master cyl.
lube
oil
patch a hole in the drivers side floor
St. inspection
and a really good vaccume!

do ya think I'm getting ripped off?  I'm not sure but it sounds pretty
good to me!
