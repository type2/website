Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor-odd #, can't find

&gt; However, the model I have,
&gt; 111 905 205T
&gt; 0 231 137 029 (Bosch #)
&gt; I can't find listed anywhere. I was told it came off
&gt; a 1600 Single Port,
&gt; and was working at the time.
&gt; Any of you folks with parts books got that one
&gt; listed?

The partsmicrofiche I have (1976) only lists:

   111 905 205 AA

According to the info printed there it was used for
B-engines which is the 1600 singleport.

&gt; Also, does it matter which vacuum port I hook it up
&gt; to?

Don't really know the answer to that question. Isn't
there just one option? I think mine has a connection
for that on the carburattor, but then US and European
carbs may be different.
