&gt; Working on a bus that currently has a auto trans with a Weber progressive.
&gt; The throttle linkage has been broken, but I'm going to weld a new 6mm stud

&gt; with a hole for the rod w/ c-clip and spring? to go thru.  Any pitfalls with
&gt; auto and carb I need to be aware of?

??? how is it set up, it &quot;Should&quot; be accelerator linkage to right side of
tranny, then rod runs to the throttle.  at the &quot;air box&quot; not sure how you
do it on a carb... but still needs to go by way of the tranny.
