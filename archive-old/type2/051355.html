David,

I wonder if you can get it tested over there to see if
it conforms to EPA, and if it does to stamp it?  I've
heard the speedometer can be as easy as taping a mph
grip om top of the speedometer (kludgey, but if it
works...).  Some of the other stuff sounds like a deal
breaker if the 94 doesn't have it (side beams,
etc...).
