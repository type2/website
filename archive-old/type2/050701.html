Subject: [T2] shops in chapel hill

&gt;              Any VW shop near Chapel Hill, NC?

of course!  in chapel hill you're got import haus (formerly bug haus). it's
only a 1 man show, you need to call before lunch time, he's usually making
parts runs in the afternoon. he has kind of an &quot;aloof&quot; attitude, and CAN be
helpful if you ask the right questions. that's just my opinion, YMMV.
919-967-7414

in durham you have hicks vw, can't say much about the service or employees,
but i've bought some wheel cylinders and headlights from them, they have a
lot of parts in stock (mostly type1 stuff) 919-596-1026

in raleigh you have transporter works. Sean is very friendly and helpful,
i've had my crankshaft replaced by them (don't ask) and they're very nice
about answering my stupid questions. 919-834-2800

hope this helps!
Peace!
