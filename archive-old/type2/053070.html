Subject: Re: Engine Drop

I like the mover's dolly idea myself.  The main difference between that and
my plan is that mine's set up to allow you go slide a hydraulic lift between
the casters to receive the engine once it's unbolted, then you lower it down
onto the dolly.  The lift then slides out and the engine moves around more
conveniently on the dolly.

But either way's OK by me.

&gt;I note that my local Home Depot has a nice rectangular mover's dolly with
&gt;2-1/2 inch heavy duty casters for $20 or so.  You can't buy the casters
&gt;for that, and the lumber can be reused for the engine stand!
