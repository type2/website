Subject: 2 cv variant-

Gentlepersons-
                       Somewhere out there on the type 2 list, is an owner
of a 2 CV...He, or someone like him, might be able to track down info
on a variant called the &quot;Africar&quot;. Like the Beetle, it was designed to
be completely, and locally, rebuildable with much wood (yes), used in
the body.
TIA
