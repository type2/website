&gt;but only now, with the weird stiffening-up (burning smell) and later
&gt;slacking off of the brake pedal during these bouts of power loss - 
&gt;and my increased reading in both books and _at_ type2_dot_com......
&gt;.............aaaaaarrrrggghh....no, not the dreaded brake booster

To test it, just pull off the vacuum line where it attaches to your carb and
plug the resulting hole (on the carb) with a similar size piece of rubber
hose with a bolt stuck firmly in the end of it.  If your problems go away,
then it's definitely in the brake booster circuit.  

To further test, you can re-attach the line to the carb, but disconnect it
where it goes into the booster and plug it there.  Then if your problem
comes back you know you've got a leak in the line somewhere.

Just be aware when you drive the bus without the power assist that it will
take a LOT more leg muscle to push the pedal.  I've been driving my 73
without power assist for 7 years now and neither me or my very petite wife
have any trouble using the brakes.

On the booster itself:  If you've been noticing a mysterious loss of brake
fluid and can't figure out where it's been going then it's probably been
leaking into the booster.  This is bad because brake fluid is very
corrosive.  You may need to replace your booster or have it repaired.  And
if it's full of brake fluid you'll need to replace or rebuild your brake
master cylinder (to keep the same thing from happening to the new booster).
