Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

This is going to sound strange but I've done it myself and I know it works.
F*rd trucks model years 85 to 88 have external bosch fuel pumps that are
identical to vw bus external fuel pumps for fuel injected vehicles.   Used
ones go quite cheaply, much cheaper then used vw pumps.  

However, before I coughed up the dough for a new pump I would check that
your fuel filter or fuel line wasn't plugged.  Vw fuel pumps are push pumps,
they don't pull fuel very well at all, so any obstruction upstream of the
fuel pump would make it seem like the pump was faulty.

hope that helps, Jason.

&gt; 
&gt; Fellow Bus owners:
&gt; 
&gt; I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up or
&gt; something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will not
&gt; pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying $127~
&gt; for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now.  I
&gt; have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt; higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale for
&gt; cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt; obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld it
&gt; back together?
&gt; 
&gt; Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
