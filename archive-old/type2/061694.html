Sorry, everyone, if this is a double-post:

Help!  Roconante has died: Sudden loss of power as if running out of gas,
no compression in #3 or #4, no smoke, spark plugs are clean, one valve in
each of these two cylinders just will not adjust.

Can anyone recommmend a reliable mechanic in Austin Texas?  If not, I will
have to hit the yellow pages in the morning.
