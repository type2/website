Subject: re:Old Paint

Brandt - 

Here's my .02 :

Paint never really dries completely. As the base
lacquer (what was originally used on buses) evaporates
over time, oxidation takes place with the remaining
pigment, hence the oxidized film on old paint.
Whether it can be buffed out depends on how thick the
remaining paint is. It's often very easy to buff right
thru to bare metal or primer at the very least.Try it
in a small spot first.
However, if there is a sufficient thickness left, you
can try one of the following methods:

1) Clean the bus THOROUGHLY, first with a good quality
car wash soap and water. Do this in the shade so you
don't bake soap and old dirt into the old paint. Make
sure you get all the nooks and crannies.
2)Clean the surface again, this time with a good
quality dewaxer/degreaser and a paper towel. Allow it
to dry before proceeding.
3) Remove the oxidation with HAND compound. Machine
compound on a buffer will take it down to metal.Red is
for heavy oxidation, white for lesser damage.
4)If, after all this work, the surface is smooth and
even, proceed to the next step. If not, or if the
surface is too thin, you will need to repaint - at
least you've prepped it well :)
5)Compounding alone will not stop oxidation; it only
removes the already oxidized paint. At this stage, put
on a nice coat of hand glaze. This seals the surface
and evens out small pits. After this has dried to a
haze and been bufed with a terry towel, proceed to wax
the finish. By this time it should look pretty good.
6)Use a good quality carnauba wax. That's all you need
- no snake oil, miracle claim stuff please. Again, let
it dry to a haze and buff with a dry terry towel. This
will stop oxidation for a while, but like anything
else, not permanently. Remember to wash the car often
(always with good quality soap) and wax it - but don't
wax more than 4 times a year; the buildup is a b!_at_#%
to get off.
7) Finally, another option is to clearcoat the finish
after step 4. Urethane clear will work well over old,
CLEAN lacquer; make sure this is what you have to
avoid compatibilty problems.
It takes quite a bit to restore an old finish - I set
aside a full weekend for the above. It can be worth
the effort and of course nice original paint is a good
thing. Cost? Maybe a hundred bucks for all the
necessary materials (don't cut corners here).
Clearcoat? 60-100 bucks for urethane; DON'T do it
yourself if you don't have the suit and air supply. A
good shop will charge you $6-800 for the task, more if
you haven't done a decent prep job.

Hope this helps!
