Greetings,

I got the missing, ratty cold idle and 300RPM ilde bounce fixed. 
The problem was a bad pressure regulator.  The weird part is that
it never showed up on the pressure guage that I had.  It wasn't 
discovered until I broke down and took it to a VW mechanic and
his guage showed the pressure bouncing up and down and thus, the
idle bounced up and down by 300 RPM.

Now, next question.

Cold and hot idle!!!

When it's cold, say sitting for a couple of hours, etc. it fires right
up but idles at about 600 RPM.  Then, after a couple minutes, when it's
hot, the RPM climbs to about 1100RPM.  The AUX air vlalve seems to
be OK.  I took it out cold and put 12V across the terminals and the
little slide closed in it.

Any ideas? &lt;G&gt;

Thanks!

Mark
