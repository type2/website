I resemble that remark and will add the only way to KNOW what it needs is
by periodic inspection and those inspections should not be hampered by
design. Then you can put your money where and when it is needed in an
efficient manner rather than take a shotgun approach and just replace parts
because someone thinks you need a &quot;tune up&quot;, so you replace the plugs for
security of function despite being in good functional order. 

Mechanically, unnecessary. Emotionally, worth paying for to some. Some so
insecure about things they gladly pay $6 per plug for the wizbang trick hot
plugs 'cause a sales pitch says deys mo betta. With lots of testamonials to
back it up. But no evidence. Half our economy is based upon those who catch
thrown money. The other half tries to create value. Guess which ones live
off of the other. Who creates the slack and who picks it up?

There is less slack in the air cooled designs of VW and Porsche with regard
to suitability for purpose than anything since the Great Pyramid. It's been
a long run for good reason. Recycling is so much better than throwing
things away but neither can hold a candle to keeping things in operation
indefinately through high specification materials and design with
reasonable maintenance.
