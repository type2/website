&gt; Caveat Emptor!  Everclear is now putting out a 151 proof (as opposed to
&gt; 186 proof) version.  This &quot;Weak *ss *hit&quot; is unacceptable in my mind
&gt; and may also not be as useful as a carb cleaner as it once was.  I have
&gt; only seen this in California -- the only place i've bought everclear
&gt; of late -- and would be interested to hear if it's still &quot;full strength&quot;
&gt; elsewhere or not.

In Fayetteville, NC, it's still the high-test stuff.

But c'mon. You're in California. The California Air Resources Board probably
demanded a low-VOC version of Everclear. What's next? Catalytic converters
on cattle, to cut down the methane emissions?
