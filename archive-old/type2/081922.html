1) you are missing the regulator!

2) you need two pieces of angle iron. The angle iron gets bolted to the two
straps. You have to drill 4 holes in 2 of the outriggers. The outriggers look
like an upside U. The first outrigger is about 4&quot; back from the front edge of
the sliding door opening. Two holes go in the front part of the U. The second
outrigger is a little over a foot back. Two holes go in the rear part of the
U. Have fun drilling!! The angle iron goes over the rolled edge of the U.

3) See the half-moon on each end of the guard? On my 77, the edge of the body,
below the sliding door, is in line with the front corner of the half-moon. The
one towards you as you have the tank laying in position.
If you don't understand what I mean, let me know and I can take pics of it.

Subject: [T2] propane tank


&gt; I picked up a nice original propane tank over the weekend. I am not sure how
&gt; to install it though. Can someone tell me how these tanks were attached
&gt; under their bus?

&gt;
&gt; I don't want to use it for anything inside the bus like a stove, etc, Its
&gt; going to be used just for external use when camping.
