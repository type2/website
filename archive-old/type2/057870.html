Subject: Re: Motor mounts?

Jim,

We had to replace one of my motor mounts when we redid the heads on my
engine.  Having done it, I would say that this is very do-able with the
engine in the car.  I would:

put a jack under the engine as if I were going to lower it; (with padding) 

loosen the nuts on top of the mounts; (this is the hairy part, if you
                                       can't get to them, now's the time
                                       to give up)

loosen the bolts that hold up the bearer bar;

drop the bearer bar and replace mounts;

replace the bearer bar;

remove jack.

Sean and I were not terribly impressed by the quality of the new mount,
but they are still available, so I guess we should be grateful.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
