Subject: transmission interchange

Is the bolt pattern on the manual transmission for buses from the 60's
to '85 the same?  I have a 74 type 4 motor and would like to hook it up
to a 1968 but manual transmission for the purpose of starting the
vehicle outside of the vehicle so I can start it and make sure it runs
before I put it into the bus.  Just hoping this would work.  Thanks,
Mark Fischer.
