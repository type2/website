Subject: Re: [T2] How to move the stove outside ...

Been there-on our 71 I made a shelf out of plexiglass that hinged flush
to the side of the door and had one of those &quot;knee&quot; hinges that locked
in place when you lifted the shelf.  To make it lay flush, I had to cut
a slot in the shelf so the knee hinge could poke through it when folded.
Used it to hold the gas stove.

Mark Hineline wrote: It requires placing a pair of
 fastening points (like the ones that clip the front table in later
Westys to the dashboard) on the outside of the slider, with a heavy and
 secure backing plate inside. That, and some additional tinkering for a
 lower bracket, makes it possible to hang a shelf from the outside of&gt;
the open door, suitable for holding a Coleman two- or even three-burner
 stove.
