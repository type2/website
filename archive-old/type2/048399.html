Subject: RE: [T2] Sunroof

Jim Mowreader:
&gt;&gt; A junkyard in your area may have a wrecked camper; unless it's been
rolled the fiberglass top should be okay, and since factory-made campers
started off life as sunroof Buses, you have a nice head start. &lt;&lt;

I have a '68 Westy and have often thought the opening looked like the
sunroof hole.  So, what would be involved in going the other direction?
Anyone in CA want to swap their working sunroof for a pop top?  The tent is
decent but the rear-screen zipper is bad (I have been putting off the new
canvas purchase), and I have both the long pass side cot and a '74 long
driver side cot.
