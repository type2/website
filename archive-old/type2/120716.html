Subject: Re: [T2] Re-attaching brakes lines to new master cylinder
  (again)

Drive slow and hammer the brakes, and see how many
wheel cylinders you can blow out.. Why not bleed the
brakes and then check to see if the pedal will hold
without hammering it, using regular pressure so as not
to harm anything in the system... Make sure they work
before putting it on the road, the life you save may
be your own. Phil
I could drive slow and really
&gt; hammer the brakes to see what
&gt; happens?
