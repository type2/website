&gt; vending machine, etc. Bad.

must be the part of the country, here in the East the Motel 6s have mostly
been renovated and are really nice, I haven't had a bad Motel 6 in years
and stay there as a first choice most times, and they have let me do
emergency work on my bus in the parking lot without hassles.
