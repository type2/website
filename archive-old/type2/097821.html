Subject: [T2] accessory vespa for bus

also anyone who wants to buy a vespa please dont import one, there are TONS 
of really good scoots in the country already and no one to buy them.  I am 
not a vespa dealer of any kind but I have a lot of friends with scooters they 
want to sell.  Let me know what you are looking for and I will find one for 
you.

Brennan.
