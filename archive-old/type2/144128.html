Subject: Westy pop-top ceiling fuzz?

Hi all -

I have removed and am currently repainting the
fibergalss pop-top from my '78 westy, ready for a new
tent that is on its way.  The question I have is
regarding the fuzzy &quot;flocking&quot; that is on the
underside of the top (i.e. the ceiling above the top
bunk). This has gone moldy, dry and powdery in places,
so I want to remove it all and just paint the inside
of the top (I assume I'll lose a modicum of
insulation, but my wife objects to breathing mold
spores and microfibers, for some strange reason ;-) 

On the front half of the top, I managed to sand it all
off; on the rear half, however, it is in better
condition, and cannot be sanded off easily, because it
is still flexible. So I have 3 questions:

1) has anyone found a good way to remove this stuff?

2) has anyone had any success just painting over the
flocking, and if so, what type of paint/prep?

3) has anyone tried any more-novel upgrades (such as
wood panelling, upholstered cloth over new insulation,
etc)?

Thanks in advance -

Matthew
