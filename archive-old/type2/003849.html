&gt;All type IV cases were created equal and are all 100% interchangeable.  You
&gt;can take any type IV long block from a 72-78, bolt on your old intake,


Actually I've already pmailed the origional poster and mostly Mike is right
but I want to note some interesting things as I have a 1700 case and a
couple 2.0 cases apart right now.  In fact all T4 cases aren't quite created
equal.  Beyond what we had been previously discussing about Vanagon cases
having the obvious breather box, dipstick tube hole, and not so obvious 10mm
bearer mounting holes there are more differences.  First off the 1700 is an
entirely different (slightly) casting than the 2.0.  If you look at the
pictures of the 914 1700 in Wilsons book you can see what I mean.  Observe
on page 123 the splitline of the case below #3 main bearing bore, just below
an M8 stud, where the oil pickup goes into the case.  This is a single wall
on the 1700 case, but somewhere along the line this becomes a dual wall
forming a little resevoir pocket of oil on the suction, a resevoir to which
the drilling from the pressure relief valve dumps in fact.  I would guess
for a VERY instantaneous loss of oil at the pickup perhaps in high g
cornering the little pocket would provide some buffer, but it is a real
small volume.  I didn't look but wonder if the length of the oil pickups
change slightly as the new wall is forward of the old one.  Another
difference, dual oil pressure relief valves.  Now this one I'm not exactly
sure on, I don't know if the second relief valve between the #1 lifters
dissapears between 1700/1800/2000 cases or if it dissapears for hydraulic
lifters.  I do know that hydraulic lifter cases only have the one main
relief valve and a plug where the second one would be and of course no
drilling for its return into the sump.  Perhaps the lifters themselves
function as relief at high temp/high rpm, would make sense, or perhaps they
need all the volume they can get.  Of course as well the fuel pump is not
drilled on FI cases and 914 cases feature the same dipstick drilling as
Vanagon cases, as perhaps do 411/412 cases.  All in all pretty trivial
changes but it does make me wonder what would be PROPER for retrofit of
hydraulic lifters to a solid lifter 1700-2000 case, particularly if the
second relief valve should be blocked (somehow blocking the return as well
obviously) or a high pressure (longer) piston like Automotion sells should
be used.  One also wonders about how much the little resevoir matters, VW
put it in as an improvement, but how much of one is hard to say, the pickup
tube lengths if different could also be an issue if you have many parts
laying about.  On an aside I note I measure a couple of solid lifter cams at
about .290 lift, the hydraulic at .250 lift.  The Boston Engine guy reports
both used occasionally in hydraulic 2.0's from VW so I also wonder if the
solid cam isn't a good idea for a little warmed over engine.

Anyway just some mindnumbing case facts.

As to the origional poster and anyone else who cares, as Mike says, and '72
to '83 actually block will bolt right in given you used '79 heat exchangers
on the '79 to '83 blocks and kept your origional fan shroud.  The bearer
mounting problem I'm guessing can be cured the same way VW cures it, it
appears to me ALL T4 cases are drilled M10x1.25 I guess and all from '72 to
'79 have helicoils in the 4 bearer holes from the factory.  One could simply
run 4 helicoils into a Vanagon case for Bus use or I guess try to extract
the inserts for Vanagon use from a Bus case.
