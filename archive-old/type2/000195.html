Volks,

  I purchased a nice salvage heater box to replace one that was bad and did 
not pay attention and now I have two of the same not a right and left heater 
box. I noticed where the cable to the heater box has two places to affix to 
the support. Are those two cable supports there so you can use a right or 
left heater box on either side????

 Thanks,

  David
