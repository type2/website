Subject: electrical gremlins update - more info...

more stuff I just noticed. 

with headlights off, everything seems to work...except...when the RIGHT
turn signal is actuated, it flashes all four lights - both signals up
front and both side marker lights at the rear. Left turn signals work
fine. With headlights on, right turn signals do not work at all. 

Emergency flashers work fine when the headlights are off - with headlights
on, they are reallllllllyyy slow. I've been having problems with the emerg
flashers - the relay has been buzzing nastily at me for a while - I
replaced the fuse for that circuit yesterday and that seemed to fix it. I
have not pulled the signal relay and tried a swap. 

thanks in advance
dan
