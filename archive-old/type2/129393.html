&gt;Hi Eric, you didn't say what year your bus is or what type of engine and what kind of shape it's in. 
&gt;
1974, 1700cc  motor, carburetod by a single  Holley,  in running shape,
with no charging system (the topic of earlier posts.)  It's very dirty,
however, and most of the tin is rusted. I don't have the tools to do a
compression test.  I will likely solve that issue shortly.  Can one be
performed while the engine is not in the vehicle?  From what I
understand, the engine has to be turned over?  Brakes are nothing
special, and the suspension isn't anything to write home about either.

&gt;I would keep the bus around (you didn't say if it's your only transpo, I'm assuming no) 
&gt;
correct.

&gt;Then strip everything from your bus and send the shell to the crusher.(This is pretty much what I did) 
&gt;  
&gt;
I think I may be just dropping the engine and possibly transmission, and
do exactly that.

&gt;By your own account, you don't expect to get much for your bus, and what are you going to do with the $$$? 
&gt;
Honestly, I got the bus for free from a friend who wanted some
carburetor work done on his car.  I could care less what I get from it. 
The money will likely just go to bills and life.

&gt; It will be gone before you know it(it doesn't sound like you are in the midst of hardship, apologies if you are).
&gt;
I owe, but I survive. The dude abides.

&gt; Good luck with your decision, I hope you get to the one that works best for you 
&gt;  
&gt;
Appreciate it.  Thanks for the good advice.

Eric
