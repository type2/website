Subject: 72 wiper motor in a 78 bus

Hey guys,
I stripped out the plastic cog in the drive assemble of my 78 wiper motor.  I 
cannot find a replacement without purchasing an entire rebuild.  So I 
happened upon a working 72 motor and wondered if I can swap it in for the 78. 
 I know that it is wired a little differently; but is it possible to rewire 
the 72 to accommodate the switch and wiring of the 78.  It looks to me like 
it is possible, but I was just wondering if any of you have done this and 
have any advice.  Or if anyone has the part to fix the original that would be 
way cool!  Thanks for your consideration and help in the past.
