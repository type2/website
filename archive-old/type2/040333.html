Subject: Re: 76 westy No start after long trips???

Hi All,

FWIW, I had exactly yhe same problem w/ a watercooled VW. It supported auto
mechanics &amp; VW dealerships up &amp; down the eastern seaboard for 2 years.
Everybody sold me parts &amp; repairs, nobody fixed it. Finally, the VW dealer
in Edmonton found a crack in the exhaust manifold that let hot exhaust blow
directly onto a section of the wiring harness. When the harness melted
sufficiently, the ignition switch was shorted out. Once it cooled, the wires
fell back into place, pulled apart, whatever, and it would start. He put a
metal tape patch over the manifold crack and the part number for a new
manifold, and I made it all the way back to Atlanta with no problems.

Good luck-


&gt; My 1976 westy is acting up. Sometimes after a long period of driving...ie:
2
&gt; hours or more my van will not start. Usually I am on the road for a few
&gt; hours then stop to gas up. When I go to start again nothing. The motor
does
&gt; not turn, there is nothing. The batteries are fully charged. I can jump
&gt; start the van and it will run fine. If i were to leave the van sit for
&gt; awhile it would start after cooling down. I'm not really sure what to look
&gt; for? Any sugestions? Any similar problems?
