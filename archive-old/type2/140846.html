Subject: FW: [T2] Fair price for instrument panel?

Gezzz Fellows... The price can vary 10 to 100....what shape the thing is
in.... Are the light all working... What about the clock... And all..

I would pay 100 to have the best quality instrument panel... And I also
would pay 10 for part... But really.. How is the shape of the panel....


Price is nothing when you have a shitty thing to sell....


My 2 cents....   So before you pay ask how nice the thing is..

Cheers

Transporter '77 2L

In Banff, Alberta.. Where no instruments panel can be found for 10$
