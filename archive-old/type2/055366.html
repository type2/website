Subject: Need information on Oberg oil filter on 1600 DP

The previous owner of my 71 bus installed an Oberg Tattle Tale oil filter on 
the 1600 DP engine.  I have no idea what type of maintenance this filter 
needs.  I assume that there is an internal element that needs to be cleaned. 
  Any information would be appreciated.
