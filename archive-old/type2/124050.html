Subject: 17mm hex plug socket attachment

&gt;Howdy. All my tools got stolen a while back, and I keep finding new things
&gt;that I'm missing. I'm looking for the 17mm hex plug socket, for the tranny
&gt;plugs, that fits onto a 3/8&quot; ratchet. I've checked around at all the
&gt;FLAPS, even the VW place, and no one has them any more. I guess I can
&gt;always just get the big hex wrench, but the one for the ratchet was always
&gt;a lot easier to use. Any leads or sources? Thanks,

I just got a big nut and bolt and welded them together. I lucked out in
looking through my parts stash and I found a bolt, with 17mm hex head, that
had threads almost all the way to the head so I could weld the nut close to
the bolt head to keep it short when I cut off all the extra threads with a
grinder. I left it long enough to bottom out in the socket and stick out far
enough to reach into the bottom of the allen head screws. It is real
convenient to use with a socket in a short 3/8&quot; rachet wrench or for more
leverage in a long 1/2&quot; rachet wrench. I later got a 17mm bent allen wrench
but it turns out, I like my socket adapter because it works better.

I admit I stole the following ascii art from someone with much more artistic
ability than I have
