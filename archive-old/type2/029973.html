Andrew, you have th eopposite problem of the poor guy with the vanagon...
your cure is simple than his... open your rear hatch, remove the panel and
any fiberglass and then the large phillips head screw that holds the latch
on.  The latch has the key-code stamped on it.  Take that latch or the
code to a locksmith and they can cut a key to that code.  Or use Steve
(vwcarlocks_at_hotmail_dot_com).  He seems to be a pretty good guy and knows VW
locks!
