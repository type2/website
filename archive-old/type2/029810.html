Volks,

Back a bit, Sean and I were in my basement rooting around in a box of
parts.  I held something up and showed it to Sean and said &quot;Know what this
is?&quot;  He immediately and correctly identified the bit (I am reserving what
is was for a future week :-)  I responded... &quot;You know too much!!!&quot;

Now here is your chance.  I have put a picture at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/whatzit/

of a bit.  This bit comes from a VW bus, I promise :-)  You task, should
you decide to accept it, is to identify this random VW bit.  Please,
please, PLEASE! respond to this e-mail address, not the list.  I will fill
in the notes at the bottom of the page as soon as I get a winner.  No
prize, just the knowledge that &quot;You know too much!&quot; :-)

I hope to run this again, next friday, with a different bit.  Suggestions
of bits to present would, of course be welcomed :-)  If you have the bit,
a digital picture would be nice as well!

                           H Steven Dolan
