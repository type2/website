Subject: Re: [T2] Progressively-Worse Missing/Hesitation

Burps, hiccups?  On our 10K trip in the US, with 150K on the engine, we
were In Arizona/New Mexico near Saguaro National Monument, when it was
*HOT* in Aug.  I experienced stalling at stops, and had to keep punching
the throttle to keep going- and uphills had no power.  When we got to
Saguaro I checked the timing/dwell, and found the timing about 12 deg
retarded and the dwell like 65 deg!  Rubbing block had split in two. 
Had to let it cool an hour, as the distributor was too hot to touch to
rotate by hand.

&gt; &gt; Hello -
&gt; &gt; On recent drives in my 79 bus I'd been noticing that about once every
&gt; 100
&gt; &gt; miles or so (mostly on the freeway), I'd feel the the engine miss
&gt; ever so
&gt; &gt; slightly - just a slight burp or hiccup now and again.....&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Check your dwell.  This could be caused by point gap closing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
