No engine builder can &quot;Guarantee&quot; oil pressure, just as they cannot
&quot;Guarantee&quot; performance.....

Hot oil pressure, depens greatly on how hot the engine oil is! Most engines
that have low oil pressure at idle, only have it with hot oil, in my
opinion, over 230 degrees.

Much of this may not be the builders fault, as he may have built a
longblock, and let the customer install accessories and set timing, and
etc...

I hot run EVERY engine we build, even longblocks, with a special shroud I
have with a 2 stroke chainsaw engine to power the cooling fan....While this
is not fool proof, we can tell alot more about the engine, plus reset
valves, and break in the cam the way it should be.. We seldom sell
longblocks, I just don't like to. I prefer to set up the engine, and test
it, the way it will be for the rest of it's life..

Boston Bob is probably trying to keep from making an obligatory statement,
that he honestly cannot accurately state. In this business, I see many
people get the bad end of deals, and it drives them to be defensive in the
future, and rightfully so, but not with those who have an excellent
reputation. I give my customers the opportunity to speak with my previously
satisfied customers that already have my engines, most of them don't even
want to..

It seems that more and more, we are forced to turn down jobs, because I'm
afraid that the customer cannot be pleased.....( I can see them a mile away)
It is very difficult to tell a customer that you cannot build his engine,
because you feel he has no chance of being satisfied. I sometimes just say
that we cannot do the job due to &quot;operational commitments&quot; and let them off
easy. I would rather go hungry from turning down these types of jobs, as to
have a customer who files suite because his engine had low oil pressure, or
that it used a bit of oil, or even had &quot;hot heads&quot;

If anyone doubts my ability, or honesty, and does not place 100% trust in
meand my shop, I refuse to do the job!

All in all, most perfectionist would be better off building their own
engine..

An engine is mechanical, and NOTHING mechanical can be guaranteed,
especially an engine that has seen almost 30 birthdays..Please don't think
I'm a jerk, but problems cannot be afforded in this business.

&gt;
&gt; If the one that you reference is an aftermarket sender it is probably a
&gt; &quot;generic&quot; designed for a broad range of applications into which VDO
includes
&gt; the VW type 4 engines.
&gt;
&gt; I wouldn't_expect_their effort at maximizing aftermarket profit to result
in
&gt; a sender that matches the specs of the one the VW engineers deemed
&gt; appropriate for this particular engine.
&gt;
&gt; A check of the archives will probably result in a number of other posts
from
&gt; folks who have had the same activation threshold problem with aftermarket
&gt; senders.  I would dare to suggest that the problem may actually be with
the
&gt; use of the sender and not the engine.
