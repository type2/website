&gt; I have a book I believe is called &quot;bosch fuel injection systems&quot;, can't remember the author's name, which may be the best resource. I've looked thru it only lightly, as of yet, but being in elec. engineering trade, I would imagine a complete schematic would've stuck in my head.

&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I am looking for internal component level schematic(s) for the 1975 through 
&gt; &gt;1979 T2 (Bosch) ECU. Anybody seen one or know how to locate them?

doubt you'll ever find it, Bosch proprietary information...you could
probably reverse engineer one but  wouldn't count on actually finding
schematic, however if you do I sure would be interested in a copy
