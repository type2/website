Subject: strange things
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

My bus has been doing strange things lately.  Usually it seems just fine when 
I'm driving it, but sometimes it doesn't want to go more than 20 mph.  It 
seems to sort of hesitate when I shift into the next gear.  I was driving it 
tonight and it was doing this, then I came to a stop and it just died.  I was 
thinking I was going to have to get out and push it, but I thought I'd start 
him up and see if he wanted to move again.  Sure enough, he took right off, 
and it drives better than it did before.  Why would that happen?  Will it 
happen again?  I have no clue.
   Thanks,
    Amy
