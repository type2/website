Subject: Movie Schedule for LiMBO &amp; VW List Nite at the Drive-In

Folks,

Here it is hot off of the Rustic Drive-In's voice mail....the movie list
for Saturday's LiMBO/VW List Nite at the Rustic Drive-In:

Screen 1	8:30 Dr. Doolittle
		10:00 Something About Mary

Screen 2	8:30 Mafia
		10:00 Amageddon

Screen 3	8:30 Small Soldiers
		10:30 Lethal Weapon 4


Admission is $12/car

Plan on arriving around 7:30 pm..vans usually sit in the back row of each
screen...this, however, is not all that bad...you have the ability to
actually see the other screens. If the kids want to see Dr. Doolittle and
you want to see Mafia, no problem, park your van facing Dr. Doolittle, and
then take your lawn chair, prop it up behind your van and face the Mafia
screen.

The Rustic broadcasts its audio on FM...so if you want to watch more than
one screen, bring a portable radio.

I'll be there in my white Eurovan MV (the one with the roof racks)...

Oh, yeah, before I forget, one more time...

The Rustic is on Rt 146 in Smithfield RI, about one mile north of the
junction of RT 146 and I-295. Its about 20 minutes north of Providence. If
you are coming from Boston or the CT or RI shore...take I95 to I295.

Also, bring lawnchairs if you want...lots of people sit outside and watch.


See you there....

Ric
