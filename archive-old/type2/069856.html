Subject: Gas heater (Um, what do I do now?)

Hey all--

So I am the proud owner of an Eberspacher BN4 (Special thanks to Wallie
Meisner), and now I'm looking at all this stuff, and I'm wondering, what do I
do now?  At least I can put my warm, but extremely unsafe  propane
heater/stove on the backup list.  You probably dont want to know... (but I
wonder how many others do stupid things like that to keep from freezing?)

So where do I start?  I dont even know where this thing goes.  Under the bus?
 In the engine compartment?  anyone know anything about this?  I know someone
posted recently about this, but I didn't see any responses to the list.  Are
these safe?  Any way to make them safer?  Anybody have any literature?
 Anyone ever convert one to propane?  Is this doable?

As far as the unit goes, it appears to be in very good shape and has very
little rust on it.  The wires look a bit old, so I'll probably update those,
as well as the fuel hoses as a matter of course.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Ned
