&lt;&lt; what motor should I get to get the most optimum driveability on the 
highway WITHOUT going 60mph. &gt;&gt;

Caleb,

Simple answer, find a good used stock bus engine from a 78 or 79.  If it is 
guaranteed by the seller to be a good runner, install it along with a 76 or 
later fuel tank and all of the fuel injection components.  You  would be good 
to go with a more reliable and powerful setup than what it sounds like was 
cobbled in by a previous owner.  If you shop around, it should also fit your 
price range.

Its a 2 liter engine with hydraulic lifters, full flow oil filter, all 
aluminum case and the toughest bottom end in any VW aircooled engine.  With 
careful, regular maintenance they easily run over a 100,000 miles before 
there is a need for major engine work.  You can also easlily retro-fit it 
with a K-jetronic (CIS) fuel injection system very similar to what was stock 
in the late 70's and early 80's golf/jetta.  Much better system (IMHO) than 
carbs, a bit simpler (non-electronic) than the stock L-jetronic.   

A bug engine in a bus gets you less horsepower, 65 mph is pushing it and at 
best 75,000 miles before you start to get nervous about cooking it.  You will 
also have to find engine tin only avialable in europe or make it yourself.
