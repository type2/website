Subject: 71 Westy

Hello all!  I have been away from this list for several years after selling my
78 Bus, but have seen the light and am actively shopping for another.  I have
found a 71 Westy that is in decent shape.  But wonder if there are any
peculiarities to this year model that I need to be aware of.  Any info
appreciated.  Thanks.
