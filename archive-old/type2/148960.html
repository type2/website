Subject: Re: [T2] heater box replacements available?

Hi James,

Take the output manifolds and swap left for right. Now they point  
straight backwards, and you can get a welding shop to attach two  
smaller mufflers, one on each. It's what I'm planning to do with  
Colleen's sunroof bus.

&gt; But I don't want to bother with a heater box.
&gt; Does anyone make a piece of pipe to bolt from the header to the  
&gt; muffler?
&gt; Ideas?
