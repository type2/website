Subject: Redo Westy Interior Upholstery

I have a 73 Westy with the poptop. It is time to redo the back upholstery.
PO just recovered the original foam and fabric and 30 years have compressed
it. I think the foam is three inches thick. I can figure out the rest,
except the jump seat. Was the jump seat back also three inch foam?

I've got an electric stapler and I am pretty good with a sewing machine. How
hard can this be?

BTW, that is the same thing I said Sunday morning when we put in the new
canvas in the poptop. Boy, was that a job!!

Glad to have the list back!

TIA
