Subject: Re: [T2] 80 engine into a 73

Well, it was just a thought. I have an 80 Vanagon for sale, but I got to 
thinking about using that engine in the 73 panel van. That way I would have 
the 2.0L engine right away. So I guess the 80 Vanagon is still for sale.

&gt;
&gt;A lot of different things and adaptations to tin, filler neck dippstick,
&gt;etc.  Let a lone the heater boxex from your 73 motor will not match up to
&gt;the heads on the 80 motor and the heads from the 80 motor will not line up
&gt;with the heat system
&gt;
&gt;Can be done but  a lot more trouble than it is worth

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell me if there would be any problems with putting an engine
&gt; &gt; from an 80 Vanagon into a 73 van ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; David
