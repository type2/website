Subject: Folly's got balls!

The Folly does in fact have lots of balls, bright shiny ones.  Ohhh what 
a tricky to have you pay attention to yet another CV Joint question.

I had a look in the archives and can't seem to find what I need to know!

The rubber boot on Folly's '72 vintage CV seemes to be moulded into the 
cover.  Seems to be... can they be parted so that I can work on the joint 
without the rubber cap?  

In the haynes book, it suggests that the balls should fit in the cage 
with a &quot;snap&quot;.  Folly's balls don't snap in the cage my friends.  They 
simply fall out of the cage. I assume this is because of wear n'est pas? 
does that mean the joint is finished?

All and any suggestions are most welcomed!
