Subject: more on heater relay

Well, I cut through the mess left by previous owner to find things not as
bad as I had envisioned.  The connector on the wiring harness is intact.
He had  performed surgery and wired in toggle switches to replace the
(presumably) fried relay. Gotta admire his patience, though - you should
see the &quot;handywork&quot;.
Anyway, I can only find this relay as a dealer part (major bucks) or used
from the yard.

Can someone recommend an aftermarket source for this relay?

Oh, and I can't find the connection point for the safety switch ground wire
- it's a short br/w wire with a spade connector and it's gotta go
somewhere, hmmm...
