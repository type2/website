Subject: Looking for a 76-82 Westy

Hey, seriously looking for a Westy from the above era, or a later H2O Westy
if its been &quot;cured&quot; :-) I'm in the Pacific North-Wet, so anything close to
my homeland of B.C. (God's Country you know :-) )  would be awesome. None
rusty of course, can't find a cure for cancer yet. :-)
Many thanks,
Courtney
