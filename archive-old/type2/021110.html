&gt; &gt; Hi Everybody,
&gt; &gt;    In an earlier post, someone said;
&gt; &gt;       &quot;... I purchased an electrical fuel pump and have installed it, and am
&gt; &gt; ready to power it up.  HOWEVER, I want to do it so that it will shut off if
&gt; &gt; the engine stops running...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   The second would be from the  output of the
&gt; &gt; generator/alternator.  In theory the way this would work is that when you
&gt; &gt; turn the key to start the bus the relay gets energized, closing the contacts
&gt; &gt; and causing the fuel pump to run.
&gt; 
&gt; not exactly,, but you don't need pressure to start a CARB engine,, there is
&gt; enough gas in the float bowls..
&gt; 
&gt; Then once the engine is running and you
&gt; &gt; let go of the key the generator provides the power to keep the relay closed.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly,, as soon as the alternator is charging,, the relay is closed, and the
&gt; pump in on
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   That way if the engine should stop running due to an accident the
&gt; &gt; generator would stop with it and let the relay open, which would cause the
&gt; &gt; fuel pump to loose electrical power.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly,,, a safety feature!
&gt; 
&gt;  I believe the wiring to both of these
&gt; &gt; sources would have to have a diode in line to prevent feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; No diode required,, and VW did this exact circuit for 73 - 76 ish era buses,,
&gt; for the aux fan blower in the engine bay,, it won't run,, unless the engine is
&gt; running,  even with the key on,, as the relay is powered off the blue wire at
&gt; the regulator
