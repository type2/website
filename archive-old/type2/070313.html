rubber engine (motor) seals on my '66 Kombi a while back. The side seals

have a 1600 dp engine with a doghouse fan shroud. Am I missing a piece of
engine tin that should go in front of the fan shroud to complete the engine
seal?

there should be a verticle piece of tin that is in front (FIF) of the fan
housing that screws at either side of the front outer corner of the tin that
goes over the cylinders.   your doghouse  fan shroud should have two pieces
of tin that vent the air that went through the cooler out through the
verticle tin.     if you are missing that piece, you need to get one with the
hole for the doghouse vent to fit through.    it was missing on my 65 camper
(DPO!)

 I got the seals from a '67 junkyard camper. They are about 2&quot; wide
and have the &quot;I&quot; shape on one side for fastening to the engine compartment,
and are shaped like the letter L on the other side, like this:

                engine compartment  I--&gt;   cooling tinAnother question: on
the sides of the engine compartment, are the seals
supposed to be above or below the engine tin? They are now above the tin,
next to the spark plug seals.

your seal should have two lips, that ideally one is above and one below the
engine tin.   but as that is a PITA,   i wouldn't stress on it, itll seal.
 but if one lip has broken off, is the seal still in good shape?  cracked?
 pieced missing?
