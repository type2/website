Jeff sez...
&lt;&lt;Before sending AAA your hard earned money, read the fine print. AAA
Potomac,
anyway, I believe says &quot;nearest authorized repair facility, up to 100 miles&quot;
and may not consider your driveway an &quot;authorized repair facility&quot;. Besides,
after being a AAA
member on and off for nearly 20 yrs., when I tried to upgrade to &quot;Plus&quot; (
gives the 100 mile towing), I was told I had to be a member for 3
consecutive
years to &quot;qualify&quot;. I said &quot;Screw you folks, give me a refund on the balance
of my current membership&quot; and then I joined Good Sam.     Jeff&gt;&gt;


	I joined AAA Plus and I'd never been a member.  Ever.  I also immediately
carried away CampBook's for about 18 states and provinces.  And all the maps
to go with them of course.  And Triptik's for 3 different possible trip
routes.  In any case I got a TON of stuff.  I've used AAA to tow VW's from
one storage spot to another.  I've used them to bring me gas.  Doh!  I've
used them to tow my car from my parking lot to my friends heated garage when
my gas line froze.  All worth the price of admission.  When my bus's
alternator bit the dust and I rolled into the truck stop by Westley, CA with
barely any lights, a AAA tow truck (that I did NOT call) offered to put my
bus on a flat bed tow truck and take me to my destination in L.A.  He could
do that by stringing together three 100 mile tows into one.  He said they
did it all the time and every other towing company (that he knew of) that
contracted with AAA would do the same thing.  I could only say, &quot;But...
but...&quot;
	I turned down his offer and just had the nice fellows at the truck stop
charge my battery over night and drove the rest of the way in daylight the
next day.  You never know when you'll REALLY need those tows!
	I have nothing but good things to say about AAA+ and would not go on a trip
without it.  It's worth every penny.
