Subject: Engine Rebuild

Hey everyone,
I am getting ready to pull the engine out of my 71 bus
(standard) and while the body work is being done im
going to rebuild it. I have the how to rebuild your vw
engine book.......and am reading it........but can
someone one clue me in as to what i might need to
replace. I believe the pistons and cylinders.......but
what else needs to be done besides the usual replacing
of the wires, coil, condenser, points,
plugs.......etc.......
Thanks for all your input.
