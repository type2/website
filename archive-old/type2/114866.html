Subject: Location of aux battery

I know this has been asked before on this list, but I cannot find any of the
old emails about it. What is the recommended location for the aux battery in
a bus with a BN4 gas heater. I currently have the battery in the left side
of the engine compartment, but the BN4 goes in this same location. I really
would like to install this heater for winter use. Does anyone have both a
heater and an aux battery installed in their bus and if so, where is it
located? I do remember the list had a lot of negative feedback about putting
the battery under the seat or anywhere in the engine compartment. 

Thanks,
Corbett
