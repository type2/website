Subject: what happened??

hey everybody,
my wife and i decided to take a cruise today and so we
jump in the bus and take off.   we take a main road,
but not a high way about 30 miles to a small town
where we look around and catch dinner.   before i left
i added a little oil as it looked about a quart low.  
ran like dream there (55-65), it has been runnin like
a dream around town lately too.   anyways, drive there
fine, drive around said town, fine, head back home,
starts out great and then seems to be going a little
slow, but its hilly i figure keep on truckin.   ive
got the windows down, no radio on, sounds fine, no
pinging at all.   we get to our turn off and she
smells a little hot, then comes the smoke, a whole
lotta blue smoke, pull over shut down.   got out, oil
drippin from underneath (left small puddle) but i can
grab onto my dipstick.   let it cool off, doesnt start
easy but she starts and putt putt home.   have the
wife get out and she says passenger side exhaust is
smokin.  damn!!!   anyways i let her cool off, add a
quart of oil and fire her up.   oil lite goes off, it
idles, but slight blue smoke out of passenger side
pipe and every couple seconds a small pop out the same
exhaust.   took a quick trip up street and back and it
had about 90% power and didnt backfire at all?   so
anyways sorry for the long dialogue, but where should
i start?   its an 1800 motor, dual carbs, both heads
replaced last 1500-2000 miles (AVP)   when heads went
on, she was retimed, valves adjusted, etc.   any help
is greatly appreciated.  ughhhh?   give me the bad
news.  i can take it.
