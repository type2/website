Subject: Re: [T2] Bay window door lock syndrome

You may have some worn out parts in there.
When I pulled my lock mechanisms apart, I was struck by the extreme quality 
engineering that went into making them. They were literally still like new. 
The stupid spring was the only problem. I would have never, ever figured out 
what was wrong without Ron Van Ness's article and the type 2 list.
However, one more though does occur to me. When I was in Medford OR when I 
bought my bus, I noticed the screwed up door locks and thought I needed a 
new handle. I went to a VW part place and bought a brank new, aftermarket 
Mex/Braz/Tai handle with new keys.  Imagine my surprise when I found that it 
wouldn't even open the door. What a POS!  Luckily I got my money back. Could 
someone have done such an indignity to your bus?

&lt;No, I don't have any problems locking or unlocking the
door.  It sometimes does it when I haven't even had it
locked.  It's just hard to squeeze sometimes.  Weird.
Thanks...KR

&gt; actions, you can no longer
&gt; unlock the door with a key?&gt;
