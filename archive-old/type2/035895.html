Of late? Karl has been the primo guy in helping me keep our vehicles on the
road for about 2 1/2 years now (Both knowledge and parts). On the downside,
if not for his help, maybe we wouldn't have ALL V-dubbs (7 of them), and
could be driving one of those neat SUK's.

PS I'll soon post details on a factory installed a/c unit, for free (The one
with the entire lower dash section) that will need a compressor rebuild
(prolly), and a drive belt..and NOTHING else...in central Florida.
