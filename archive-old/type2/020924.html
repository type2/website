I was told by tire expert that unused tires can't &quot;circulate&quot; the
plasticisers in the rubber that keeps the tires flexible, and also they
&quot;dry out&quot; due to ozone and get cracks from being stiff and brittle. 
Having had a &quot;perfectly new&quot; but aged tire (taken from spare tire well
of a 74 junker) delaminate its entire tread was enough confirming
experience for me!- had a front tire blowout coming back from the
Reading show last year.
