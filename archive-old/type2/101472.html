Subject: A kindler &amp; gentler vintagebus...

One of the few cool bits on my site is a mechanism where you can leave
comments for any of the pix that are uploaded to the gallery, so you
can add info, ask questions, etc.  It was getting polluted with all
kinds of nasty flame wars and whatnot, so I've implemented a close-loop
system, so you have to confirm comments via email.  It's already cut
the nasty stuff by 100%.  I guess I shoulda done this sooner...
