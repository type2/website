Subject: Re: heating ducts

Sayeth Mike Howles &lt;mike_howles_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;:

&gt;The heating duct that exits between the front seats and ejects hot
&gt;(hopefully) air rearwards into the passenger compartment was only fitted
&gt;to microbuses.

As opposed to...?  If we're talking Bays, I've had a '71 deluxe station wagon, a '71 westy, and a '68 westy.  All had the heater outlet in the walkthrough, and when it 
was operational, you pulled out the knob to make it so.  

IIRC the term &quot;microbus&quot; was never applied to Bays, but if you mean the fancy-trim model, those westies don't fall into that category.  (OTOH maybe they do, since 
they started with sunroof body shells?)
