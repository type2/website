&gt; What if a person installed an external oil cooler on the inside of the bus?

A quite common mod in bugs these days, neat custom job with blower
mounted and all, essentially a 200 F radiator, available from many
sources.

&gt; Would there be problems related to the distance the oil might have to be pumped?

Not really, put it close to the engine back under the rear seat with
a blower.  I know he's out of favor but Bernie sells the stuff to
basically do this on T4's as does Eurorace, with thermostat I figure
it would set you back maybe $250 or so.  I've always wondered myself
why people don't promote these for the bus, a T1 engined bus could use
the standard Bug kit I guess.  The only inconvenience I see is summer
mounting and swapping it about, I always figured it would be really
swift to somehow rig it in a little box with some flappers so in the
winter it sucked interior air and discharged to the inside but then in
summer it sucked exterior air and discharged it outside.
