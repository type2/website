Subject: Heater air followup (was: Oily Heater air)

YEA HAW!
I found that the starboard hose coming off of the fan in the engine
compartment was just hanging there, unattached to the heat exchanger.  I
cleaned up some oily areas, re-attached the hose and went for a test drive.
Not only is the oily air gone, but I can actually feel the heat in the cab
now.
Woo hoo, I feel like I can fix anything now!
