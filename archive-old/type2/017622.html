&gt; While at the local LAPS (won't call this guy friendly:^}{ ) hs tried to
&gt; sell me a vacuum advance/retard distributor.  Don't know the part #, but
&gt; it has a single vacuum can on the side with 2 hose connections.  He's
&gt; asking $80.  Too steep?  Can I get one somewhere else cheaper?
&gt; 

I think it i stoo steep. 
If you arunning a 1600sp or dp, in a 71 or earlier  ( us spec) bus, I
would look for a dual vacuum. ( push and pull, retard and advance) Later
buses, type4 engines, look for the correct single vac. (Is that right?,
been so long since I looked at a type4...)

IMHO the 009 mechanical advance is a bad idea. Many good mechanics
disagree with me here, including Muir.  My buses run better with the
correct dizzy.

I find them at swaps for between $5-20. But you have to give them a suck
test and see if the vac can is good. It should advance the whole works
when you suck on the vac port. Or go get yourself a good vac meter if
you don't suck. :)

If you need a new one, usually you can get the vac can new from Bosch
for between 25- $175.  More for the duals. (ouch!)
