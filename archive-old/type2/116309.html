Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way

Yeah, I agree. I agree 100%. I can't tell you how many times cheap parts
have come back and bitten me in the butt. Just 1 example. I had this old
beat up 1985 Fiero GT that I got for like... 1,200 bucks. The alternator was
rattling, but still working after 163k miles. I replaced it just because of
that (failing bearings). I replaced it with one from Discount Auto Parts,
and after 6 months, it died.. I casually coasted (while the engine died)
into the TOLL PLAZA off The Ronald Reagan Turnpike. Luckily it was at 10:00
at night (after a college class), so there wasn't much traffic.

Another time I got bit in the ass was with a cheap waterpump I bought. This
was also for another Fiero. It was for my 1987 Pontiac Fiero SE / V6. I
bought a cheap Coltec waterpump. The impellar was plastic. After 6 months, I
was cruising down the road on I-95, driving to the office, just minding my
own business. Not really paying attention, I was maybe going 65mph. THe
impellar broke free from the shaft and my engine started to overheat. The
temperature went WELL beyond the red area.. even so much in fact that it
went into the black, and pegged itself on the little metal peg. Luckily, I
was using Synthetic oil, so the motor didn't seize. I was also able to
rebuild it, no warped heads, or block. But it put that car out of comission
for the greater part of 2 and a half years while I found the time to work on
it and pull the motor.

SAME thing happened to my 1997 GrandAm that I drive every day. The
alternator went out at about 97 or so k miles (I drive a LOT of miles back
and forth to work), I replaced it with a cheap alternator from Discount Auto
Parts. In less then 5 months, the internal voltage regulator started to fail
and the lights flickered. I took it out and returned it for a free new one
at Discount again. By this time (just 4 months ago??) they said that they
switched brands, and now they get their remanufactured parts from a
different distributor because the last manufacturer had sub-par quality
parts. Well, I took the guys word for it. 4 months later, the car is still
kicking perfectly.. so we'll see.

But when you have the money, it's ALWAYS worth it to get GOOD quality
replacement parts.

I watched folks buy the cheapest parts and come 
back within a year to replace it again. Folks, if the original starter 
lasted 20 years then the replacement damn well better last at least 10 
more....
