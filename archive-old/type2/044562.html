&lt;&lt; howdy,

Sorry for the waste of bandwidth but can some kind soul please direct 
me to a website that allows me to date my bus? &gt;&gt;

Sounds kinda sick to me.  I like my bus, like her a lot, be we don't date, 
were just good friends.

Maybe that kinda thing is legal in NM, but not here in MO.
