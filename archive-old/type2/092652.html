&gt; &gt;Two problems with filing points. New points come with polished, radiused
&gt; &gt;faces. When you file them, you get flat surfaces that are only parallel
&gt; &gt;when open the width of the file. When they close, they contact near the
&gt;
&gt;Being radiused, doesn't that mean they will pit in the center and then the 
&gt;dwell will change whereas if they are flat the current will find the next 
&gt;shortest path, possibly resulting in the same dwell?

If the points were flat, it would spread the spring tension over more area, 
and can cause poor contact. They have a radius so that they do not make 
contact near an edge and have a smaller area of contact that insures a good 
contact. Consider just how difficult it would be to get two tiny flat 
surfaces perfectly parallel. The radius insures good contact away from the 
edges, even if they don't line up perfectly.

This is one difference between Bosch points and so many other wannabees I 
have seen. They tend to line up very near center most of the time. I can't 
remember the last time I had to tweek a set of Bosch points to get a good 
alinement. It happens, but very rarely in my experience of dozens per year 
for many years.
