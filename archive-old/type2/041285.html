Subject: Looking for an east caost gang!!  Beach blanket bingo baby!!

Anyone on the list in the eastern shore of delmarva. Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia...  I'd like to sponsor a bonfire party at Assateauqe Island.
Complete with BBQ and a Clambake.  We can roll around the island doing the
wild pony and pedestrian slolom then settle into a nice parkinglot on the
beach?  Anyone interested.
