&gt;  Do I have to loosen the fan housing such that I can pull the tin

&gt; I'd say the fan shroud has to come off no matter what.  I did this in the GWB.

I've done both heads with a 2l still in the buss, you don't have to touch
the fan shroud

&gt; I believe it actually takes more work to pull a head in the bus, but
&gt; sometimes it's necessary.

but it is at least twice as hard to do it in the bus than out,
