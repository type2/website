&gt;My question is this. Did I likely get some after market cheapie? 

Yes.

Keep your old oil strainer as long as you can.  The new strainers are 
flimsier and have a larger mesh screen.  As long as you clean it during your 
oil change procedure, it should last you through scores of oil changes.  When 
buying oil change kits, try to find the ones with thick composite(?) gaskets. 
 The thin paper gaskets don't seal that well, especially with a sump plate 
that is &quot;wallowed&quot; out.  In order to flatten my sump plate, I peened all the 
bolt holes so that it rested flat on a glass surface.
