&gt; Many thanks to those who responded to my query.  This list has helped
&gt; me out quite a few times now.
&gt;  I found a pitman arm puller at Pep Boys ($29.99) which fit
perfectly. 
&gt; I cinched it up real tight and whacked it twice with a log splitter --
&gt; off! I installed the replacement and wow!, what a improvement.  I was
&gt; careful to correctly align the pitman arm on the steering box shaft
and
&gt; the steering wheel shaft coupler only goes on one way, but my steering
&gt; wheel now has spokes at 11 and 5 o'clock when tracking straight. 
Before
&gt; installing the pitman arm (and after attaching the steering wheel
shaft)
&gt; I turned the steering wheel lock-to-lock and each extreme was a mirror
&gt; of the other, so I assumed the steering wheel was positioned correctly
&gt; relative to the box.  Now I'm not sure what to adjust in order to
center
&gt; the wheel: the drag link, the tie rods or the steering wheel at the
top
&gt; of the shaft.  Any ideas?

I, too have found that my steering wheel doesn't line up properly
after steering box replacement.  Nothing I did could make it line up
either.  If I moved the arm one spline either way, the box ran out of
worm gear before the wheels were fully turned to the lock.  As you
noted, the coupler only goes on one way.

My feeling is that the boxes vary in their steering wheel position and
that the normal thing to do when changing boxes is to reposition the
steering wheel to match.  Unfortunately, this is another &quot;special
puller&quot; job if you have an early bay.
