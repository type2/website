Subject: clunk!

--part1_161.3a8371c.291db576_boundary

My '73 auto has a rather severe clunk when I shift from forward to reverse or 
into gear from neutral. I've replaced all CV joints and also a bad rear axle 
and bearings. When I had the CV joints off the drive plates, I noticed there 
seemed to be a lot of play at the drive plates. Does this mean something in 
the final drive is worn out? Or am I overlooking other possibilities?
Thanks in advance.
