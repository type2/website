&gt; Posting for a friend: Anyone know the difference in
&gt; the starters between a 79 Auto tranny and a manual
&gt; tranny?

the auto tranny starter is bigger and has no nose bearing.

&gt; Is it possible to put a starter from a late bay auto
&gt; into a late bay manual??

maybe, some will fit some won't it depends a lot on all the mods done over
the years...  my suggestion, put in what came out...
