&gt; I've been trying to solve a fuel mixture issue with my

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if this would create some sort of
&gt; issue? He didn't seem to think so. What's the
&gt; differnce?

There should be no issues with that at all.

But I have to ask -- What does he mean, &quot;FI heads&quot;?

Does he mean &quot;heads from a Porsche 914 1.7&quot; or &quot;heads from a 411/412  
1.7&quot; or &quot;heads from a '75 Bus 1.8&quot; or &quot;heads from a '76-or-later 2.0&quot;?

The valve sizes are different on all of those heads, and there are  
going to be slight differences in which holes are there (temp sensor,  
etc.) that might need to be plugged on carb configurations.
