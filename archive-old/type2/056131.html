hello list,
just had to post after a tremendous day working on jessy. replaced her
old tattered canvas today. thanks ron. i do not know if i installed it
right but its in, no tears, windows work, and its tight.

that gave me the push to instal my clock. thanks karl. wow what a
beautiful thing that is. also went into the parts bus and replaced all
the lights in the instrament panel. cann't wait to drive at night to
enjoy the lights. previosly only the idiot lights worked. so this is a
wonderful thing.

also insalled new ignition switch. the bus came with no keys. i found
one that would start it but had a hard time turning off. completely
oppisate from what we read on hear. got one from a flaps, much cheeper
than what i have wasted on locksmiths. and this works.

so the bus gods must be smiling, to be able to do all this and still be
able to drive to the store afterwards. just thought i'd share.
