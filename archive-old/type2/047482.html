&lt;&lt; Also, I'm looking for a child's cot that will fit 74-75 Westfalia (i.e. 
solid stamped galvanized poles measuring 57 1/4 inches).  After purchasing 3 
wrong child's cots, I think I've learned my lesson on determining that it's 
the correct one before sending money :-(

The child's cot was missing when I bought my '74 and I looked around until I 
found one.  Now that I have it, I always leave it at home.  It is a PITA to 
install and you will end up scratching your paint.

Unless you have a child to put in it, I say don't bother finding the right 
one.
