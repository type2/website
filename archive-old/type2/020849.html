Subject: Westy Interiors - more questions

Hello list-ees,
This seems to have been a fairly hot topics over the past few days so I
thought I'd ask
a few questions while it's in our minds.

Can anyone give more specific information on the different Westy
interiors, preferably
with links to pictures?
SO44 looks like .....
SO69 looks like.....
How many different styles?  What does each one looks like?
What interiors came with what years?

I recently purchased my first bus, a '72 Westy pop-top, walk-through and
obviously
I have no idea what type of interior I have.  Little ugly box seat
behind the driver.
Sink/icebox behind the passenger.  1 piece shelving unit to rear of
sliding door,
w/ coat closet.  Over bed shelf.  In the grand scheme of things, it's
not that important
but I would just like to know.
Here's the M-plate in case it helps.  I've pretty well deciphered it,
but found nothing on
the interior styling other than &quot;camper.&quot;
22 089 174
172 507 518
992651 A02 P31 027 095
51 4 7509 TE 2319 41

Note the &quot;TE&quot; destination code.  Interesting, especially in combination
with the
California emissions.

Thanks all,
Paul Morgavo
'72 Westy
