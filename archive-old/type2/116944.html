John,

You really should take off your flame suit and put on your ridiculous hat, because if you wanna claim &quot;the 60's&quot; all to yourself, and say that no one else can get to the personal nirvana of your summer of love, then you've forgotten how transcendental all those ideas really are. Which was kinda the point.

What you saw was a cyclical manifestation of a theme in human culture that has been here before and will be here again.

Don't be the burnout guy with the comb-over ponytail listenin' to zeppelin in an old tie-dye mumbling to yourself &quot;nobody digs it, man.&quot; 

You're playing to your own ego.

Billy

p.s. the anti-war rallies of this generation were the largest ever to take place on this planet. It only took a few months to organize, not 20 years.

&gt;No, nothing like it before or since. 
&gt;(Asbestos suit on).
