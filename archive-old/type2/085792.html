Subject: Re: [T2] Air-fuel gauge results

If you have pretty much eliminated vacuum leaks there are other reasons for 
a lean running pre-lambda L-Jetronic system (stock 75 thu 78 VW bus models). 
As an example fuel pump dropout.

One cause of fuel pump drop out is the gradual increase in value with time 
(Age) and temperature of the resistor in series with the pump solenoid 
located in the Double Relay. Drop out may be intermittent at first and 
finally degrading to the point that after starting the engine completly dies 
(in start the resistor is by passed). To check for this condition measure 
the resistance to ground on pin 36 in the AFM cable connector on your 78. A 
normal value is around 60 ohms. A value of 200 ohms has been observed to 
cause severe run after start problems.

Also non-stock (improved flow) exhaust systems can tilt the air/fuel ratio 
to the lean side. so can hot cams and ported heads. Reasons to keep it stock 
for long engine life.

Keep up the good work.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Well, I gave up and bought myself an LED gauge (Autometer) to connect to 
&gt;the Oxygen sensor that I added to my '78 for tuning. It actually looks like 
&gt;my voltmeter was giving me the correct readings after all, but the gauge 
&gt;does make it much easier to see the swings in  mixture.
&gt;
&gt;I'm curious to hear from other listees (78 or before) who are using an 
&gt;oxygen sensor and an air/fuel mixture gauge. I'd especially like to know 
&gt;whether during light acceleration/cruise whether a (very) lean condition is 
&gt;normal. I have my AFM tuned to be a little on the rich side most of the 
&gt;time, but under certain conditions light throttle/cruise the gauge displays 
&gt;lean. I don't know whether this is normal, a problem, or an exhaust leak 
&gt;that I haven't found yet. I'm swapping in another AFM soon to see if it 
&gt;behaves different, but your experiences would be useful to know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!!
&gt;
