Mike,

When I was with Media General and traveling back and forth between my 
TV stations (I was the Interactive Media Regional Pres.) during the 
summer, not having A/C would have been VERY bad form for me.

In fact, in your town, I used to stay at the Radisson Riverfront since 
it was directly across the street from WJBF. Just walking out the hotel 
door and across the street to JBF was enough for me to look like i had 
just taken a shower...at 8 a.m.!

/Grin

A/C = Anton looked like an executive, instead of wet roadkill!

Good times.
