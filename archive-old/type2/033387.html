Subject: RE: sooby in a bus

Another option for a hidden radiator is on the front of the bus in full
view... just make it look like a spare tire :)  Checkout my Wild VW site at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811 and go to buses, there's one
there that uses this method.

As for the adapter, you'll need one for sure and maybe a spacer for your
clutch throw out bearing so the clutch disengages properly, the adapter
plate increases the gap between flywheel and clutch plate on some
conversions.  What soob engine, the 2.0LT fuel injected ones are not an easy
fit, they're quite tall and long and the inlet manifold and air flow meter
can hit the cover over the petrol tank etc.

For my V8 conversion I mounted the radiator behind a bull bar, with it
painted black it's not too obvious and it gets good airflow, radiators
mounted at the rear need to be very efficient and you have to make sure hot
air from the engine doesn't flow through the radiator as well otherwise you
have problems.  In saying this I know of one 2.0LT Soob bus with the
radiator at the rear and it runs fine, although we're only just geting into
the hot Australian summer days :) so time will tell.  Puting the radiator
under the front sounds OK too, I know of a 2.6lt Bus with the radiator there
and it works fine, it's on my website too somewhere.

If you use the air vents for the radiator you'll also find your super
heating the air drawn into the carb/air flow meter and this can cause
performance problems, I'm yet to put ducting to my big holley carb to get
around this but I certainly notice the difference after the bus has been
running in traffic for awhile.

Anyway, hope all this helps a little
Cheers

Subject: sooby in a bus...

well in my progress to decide to sell the bus, or put a sooby engine in, i
have not completely decided.  but...a few listees wrote asking about the
radiator problem.  i plan on puting one where an a/c condensor goes under
the floor of a bus.  the radiator would have a temp-controlled fan, so
forced air would only help supplement the cooling of the radiator.  or the
other choice is to put it where the *second* battery would go in the back.
this option allows air to be forced down the *shaft* where the air vents
draw in air as you zip down the road.

thats where i am at so far.  i do want to know tho if anyone knows if i for
SURE need an adapter plate to bolt it in or will it go directly on the
tranny.??

thanks,
