Subject: `71 BUS MASTER CYLINDER CONVERSION HELP!

Hi folks, here is a good one for ya...

We have a `71 bus here, picked it up free.  We have her running and
ready to drive.  She is kinda rough hit in nose soem rust but still not
worth scraping.  All works fine.

Brakes are as follows...original drums in rear. The front end is off a
`73 bus disc brakes.  Bus has Power brakes set up. Bus has been sitting
for 5 years brakes are shot.  I can get the rear cylinders cheap and the
front calipers rebuilt fairly cheap. 

I dug into the Master cylinder and she is junk...also noticed vaccum
leak and found it is the servo in front of the Master cylinder so she is
junk too.  New servo is $150+ and master cylinder is $40...to pricely
for this old junker...we just wanna drive her as a sceond beater truck. 
Noticed that you could get this bus withOUT power brakes...problem is
that Master cylinder is $135!!!  

Here is my question and idea...I see there is a bracket already in place
on the bus for the NON power master cylinder. This looks identical to
the bracket on my `65 bus.  Master cylinder for that bus is
cheap...single curcit unit but works great!  $29 I think !  Anyhow...she
will mount right up to the existing bracket....and I can fab the correct
push rod and cut an access hole for the resevoir.

Anyhow...my question IS can I use this earlier bus Master culinder in
conjuction with the disc brakes in front and rear drums in
back...basically stock?  I would assume this would work fine.

Anybody donw this...hints bad points.._dot_can it be done or not...

Our #1 priority on this bus is cheap...it is whooped and we just wanna
get her driving.  Thanks for your help!
