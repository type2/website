Subject: Covering VW emblem?

I seem to remember some discussion on the list of covering the VW emblems at 
a publicized bus gathering.  Is that gathering EB?  Is everyone still 
convinced that VW is trying to run our parts suppliers out of business?  If 
yes to both of these, are people going to be covering their VW logos/badges 
for photo ops?

If so, please please please pass these pics along.  I'd love to see them, 
maybe even forward them around in a god-awful email chain that some somebody 
up in VW corp might see.

Have fun at EB!
