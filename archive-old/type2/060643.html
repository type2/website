Subject: EGR Filter

With the advent of dyno testing of emissions here in New Jersey, no
longer just at idle, I'm once again thinking about EGR.  It's very
important for control of NOx at part throttle, and that's what they're
going to be looking for now.

I fully comprehend the principles of the EGR system, but what I'm
wondering about is the filter.  What is it intended to filter out of the
exhaust gases?

I'm again thinking of re-activating my EGR system simply with tubing -
without any expen$ive filter in the line.
