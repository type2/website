Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak from big screw in case - what's the tool

&gt; Have an oil leak from a big srew in piece about 1.5

&gt; to tighten or do I just need a gargantuan flat head screwdriver?

Sounds like the oil pressure relief valve. That would be a big screwdriver.
What do people use?

I've seen such a tool in the Porsche tool catalogs but it was $30 so there
must be an inexpensive alternative.

BTW, there is an o-ring under the screw...
