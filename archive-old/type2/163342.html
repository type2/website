Subject: Re: [T2] bosch w8cc superspark

As I was reading this email I happened to be on the phone with my Bosch
contact, told him what the email said, and his reaction was WTF?  He said
maybe Autozone's discontinued them from their line (prolly &quot;cost-cutting
measure&quot;), Bosch has NO plans to ever discontinue the W8CC.  Fits so many
European &amp; Japanese makes.

NGK B5ES is the equivalent (you can use BPR5ES [Bosch W8DC]) and either one
works fine, but out of habit I just prefer the Bosch.

My 2 cents worth.....

&gt; Tried to pick up a set of the w8cc's from autozone and had no luck. They
&gt; told me
&gt; that the bosch w8cc's were discontinued. Is this true? Also, would anyone
&gt; know
&gt; which NGK plug would be best for a 2.0 FI for hot weather use? Thanks.
