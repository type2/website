Subject: Clutch/Pressure plate Q -- '71

As you might recall, I replaced the clutch cable on the campmobile
a couple of weeks ago. Well, I just readjusted the thing for the
third time -- I have about 1/4 inch of threads left before I run
out of clutch cable.

I also had a problem with the clutch not catching -- shifting from 
3rd to 4th up a hill, warm, the engine spun a bit until I let off the
throttle a bit, then it caught.

I'd like to revisit the thought on a bad pressure plate...does this 
sound like it could be a contributing factor?  The last time I had
the engine out, I noticed that some of the ends of the fingers (this
is the multi-leaved pressure plate with no ring in the center) had
what I can only call notches in the tips -- they were still full-length, 
but some of the corners in the center were knocked off.

What are the symptoms of a failing pressure plate? Or does it just 
let loose all at once? I've never had one go out on me --I think this
one came in the BAP rebuild I bought about 4 years/ 65000 mi ago. I
might have reused this one though...I'm not sure.

Anyway - I don't have a real good feeling that this is just clutch
cable wear-in..The old cable was showing the same symptoms (frequent
adjustments), so I replaced it, but it didn't show the usual fraying
that all the others I've replaced had (at least the ones I caught before
they snapped).

Kibbitzing Welcomed.
