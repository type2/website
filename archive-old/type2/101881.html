&gt;    This weekend I paid $100.00 for a set of new repo  VW mud flaps with &quot;65&quot;
&gt; on them, and I was happier then hell. It was at BBB7 and I bought $100.00
&gt; worth of raffle tickets and they are all I won.

At least you got a VW part.  I am the proud owner of a $40 toilet brush :)

&gt; The big winners were the kids of Lake Havasu.

Amen to that.  Some of those letters the kids write are real tear-jerkers.
Those kids are the most worthwhile charity I can think of.

Had a great time.  A more detailed trip report is coming soon!
