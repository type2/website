Subject: still no luck in provo

I've tried all the type2 resources, but still no luck. My wife is getting a 
tow into Provo tonight, then in the morning we'll keep on looking. Any help 
on finding a provo VW shop would be great.

What a trip it has been, first the overheating, then the starter motor, now 
the Altrenator.

Thanks!
