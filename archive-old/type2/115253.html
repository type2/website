Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy, won't idle, backfires after oil change, new
  coil, new  plugs

I replaced the coil because the old one was of indeterminate age, and looked
like it had been used as a soccerball one too many times. It seemed like
good piece of mind on the open road for not too many bucks. The old one
still worked however, and I have tried putting it back in, but it made no
difference. I believe I have it hooked up correctly: condenser is to
negative, and it did run fine for a while.

Thanks,
Matthew

 Why did you replace the coil?
 Did you hook it up backwards?  Does the green condenser lead go to the - or
negative side?
