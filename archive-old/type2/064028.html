External electrical connections different?

&gt; 2.Can someone explain how the tailights work on a Euro bus? It appears that
&gt; they are two filament or soemthing like that?

I think they are a two bulb system.  The &quot;chrome&quot; bezel is painted onto 
the lense itself as opposed to the US export's separate bezel.  It also 
requires a different seal.
