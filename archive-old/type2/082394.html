&gt; &gt;  I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course
&gt; &gt; since nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded
&gt; &gt; fitting
&gt; &gt; at the end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring
&gt; &gt;main.  Not deterred and after seriously considering cutting=20
&gt; off the end
&gt; &gt; =20
&gt; &gt;  Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at=20
&gt; least something
&gt;=20
&gt; in the 30-34 psi range

I figured it would read at least a couple of PSI since fuel is coming =
out...

&gt; was gonna answer more of your questions but got tired of manually
&gt; formatting your original message, turn on your word wrap and set it at
&gt; about 74 or so then repost and I'll answer the rest of your=20
&gt; questions, or
&gt; maybe someone else will.

Sorry.  We've been forced to switch to Outlook at work (no way to set
word-wrap for some reason.)  The post was sent from home using the
Outlook Web Access, also no settings for word wrap, I'll repost later
(with hard carriage returns I suppose.)

Thanks,

Rob
