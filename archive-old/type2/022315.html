Subject: Urethane Primer question
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.1.19991022111927.00af2250_at_pop.multipro_dot_com&gt;

I'm refinishing some fiberglass (poptop) on my VW bus.

Figured somebody out there has used Urethane primer so you might have some 
insight.

The paint supply store salesman said that the primer did not have to be 
thinned out. He said mix to the instructions on the can, add the catalyst, 
and shoot. Well my little compressor wouldn't squirt it - too thick. Not 
surprising, it's a non-tank, rotary compressor - so it's small! (And my gun 
is probably too big since it's for a tank-equipped compressor). But this is 
not the question. I'll borrow the right size gun tomorrow.

The instructions on the can says to thin with urethane reducer. My friend 
suggested that I might try  substituting acrylic enamel reducer. Since my 
paint was already in the gun, and this first coat was being shot after dusk 
(!!!) - I ran out of time and light - I figured what the hell?

It shot fine, and seems to lay fine, and since the surface of the 
fiberglass (gel coat mostly gone due to age) is rough and will have to 
receive alot of sanding, I'm not too worried.

But for future reference, when I have the same situation, and need to shoot 
some Urethane primer when it really counts --- will this substitution make 
a difference?

On a side note, I love this primer. I have used lacquer primer, and it 
works fine, but his urethane primer is really great stuff - a high build 
primer. I had not used it personally on any of my cars, only assisted with 
other people's projects. If I can afford it, I'll be using this primer all 
over the next car I paint (my '65 Beetle with a 914 spec motor and 
hopefully a Porsche 5 speed eventually).

Thank you all in advance.

We return you to your previously scheduled discussion, already in 
progress....  &lt;grin&gt;
