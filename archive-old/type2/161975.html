Hi Courtney,

I have my radio wired to the battery full-time and it has not been a  
problem. The LED on the faceplate does not draw enough power to worry  
about, even if the bus stays put for a week or more. If I am away  
from the bus any longer than that I usually pull off the faceplate,  
and the radio and battery have lived like that in harmony for months  
at a time over the winter.

I'd suggest you check out the current draw when off before  
permanently instaling the radio, in case you happen to have a more  
thirsty rig like Bruce does.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I've just bought a CD/Mp3 player that I'm going to install into my  
&gt; 77 Westy.
&gt; Our vehicles do not have an accessory spot on the ignitions, just  
&gt; off or on.
&gt; How are people wiring their players in? I have a yellow wire to go  
&gt; to +12volts
&gt; always on for the memory, but then I have a red one that is to go  
&gt; to accessory
&gt; on, which we don't have on our vehicles. Should I just wire it  
&gt; direct to the
&gt; same place then as the yellow wire? I can't think of any other way  
&gt; in a
&gt; vehicle like this? How much does the LED face on these units draw?  
&gt; I'd hate to
&gt; have my battery dead if I left it parked for a week as I often do.
