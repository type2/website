Subject: help on a 69 beatle engine in a 72 westy

hey,

this is my first time on this list and i was hoping you guys could help me 
out.
i have a 72 westy that has been sitting for 3 mnths and i recently bought a 
69 beatle that my freind roled last summer. the body is a write off so i 
bought it to put in my westy. I blew my engine in it in sept.
The bugs engine was rebuilt a little while back and is in super shape.
I'm looking for help on how to do this. what conversions do i have to do and 
if i need extra parts, where do i get them.
please don't email me if your going bto tell me that i'm an idiot for doing 
this. my brother, well actually the past owner of my brothers bus also did 
this. his bus is doing awsome, apart from a little less power. The same 
years were used in his conversion also.
any help would be greatly appreciated.

kenny
