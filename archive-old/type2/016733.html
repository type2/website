Subject: curtains &amp; tires

My original camper's curtain do not look too classy anymore and I am
looking for original curtains for a 1972 Campmobile, in new or almost
new condition. Were stock curtains in 1972 Campmobiles all the same
orange-brown plaid or were there different colours and styles to choose
from? E-mail me if you have any for sale or if you know someone who has
them for sale and can mail them. I live in the Central Arctic but we
have regular dogteam mail service from anywhere in the world. It just
take 6 months to get here!

I also plan to get four new tires on time for the next summer vacations;
the posts the past few weeks on correct tires for buses were really an
eye opener for me. I admit I never realized the importance of this
issue. I find aesthetically that 185s are a bit skinny, especially on a
camper with a high top (I think mine looks like a Safare but I can't
find any proof and I never saw one in person). Does anyone have
suggestions about larger tires, with the correct load range, that would
fit on the stock rims? I only use the bus a couple of months in summer
and don't usually spend a lot of money on it so I plan to get the best
available tire, and safety of my travelling tribe (I have four kids)
will not be sacrified because of price.
Thanks
P.S. Any list member from the Northwest Territories out there?
