Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

I'll probably get &quot;moderated&quot; (again), but...  What Duane said.

Mat, have you considered a Toyota... or perhaps a Honda? Maybe a Lexus 
or H2 would work.

When I saw the coming together of the community, I was reminded once 
again what a great crowd we hang with.  This type of outpouring of 
support is why I didn't hesitate to add my name to the AIRS list with 
the notation, &quot;You can park in my driveway.&quot;

We're a family. And families help one another out.

Jim
