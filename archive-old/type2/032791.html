Subject: An &quot;internal&quot; external oil cooler?

Greetings -

All this talk of external oils coolers is making me... wonder. I figure a
&quot;little cool&quot; is better than a &quot;little hot&quot; (yes? no?). I don't think my
motor runs too hot, but I live in a hilly region, so I'm fairly certain I'm
raising the oil temp now and then when going up the long hills.

I have a (doghouse 1915) DP motor with the upright oil cooler in my '69, and
it has that rear motor mount that *almost* covers up where the rear oil pump
would go. CB Performance sells what they claim to be an external pump that
fits in that space. Assuming that pump gives me an external hookup, I would
like to mount a mesa-type oil cooler inside the engine compartment, as has
been recently mentioned on the list. I know, I know...

My questions:

1. Does anybody have oil/head temperature readings before and after doing
this type of mod? I realize the air is going to be a tad warmer going into
the fan, but how much warmer? The other vent is still sucking cooler air.

2. Does anybody have any horror stories after doing this type of mod?

3. Is it *really* advantageous to put an external filter in-line while
adding the external cooler?

Thanks -
