&gt;Just to clarify:
&gt;
&gt;TDC = TOP DEAD CENTER (Mark corresponding to Zero on the pulley)
&gt;BTDC = BEFORE TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located
&gt;counter-clockwise on the pulley)
&gt;ATDC = AFTER TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located
&gt;clockwise on the pulley)

That is exactly backwards. The pulley rotates clockwise.

If you're using a pulley with degree marks (which is what you're 
describing - &quot;on the pulley&quot;), and comparing that to a fixed pointer on 
the engine, BTDC is clockwise (on the pulley) from 0.

At least on a stock AC 2.0 engine, there's a single mark on the pulley, 
and a scale fixed to the engine - with that setup, BTDC is 
counterclockwise (on the fixed scale).


&gt;As for my motor, the idle timing is 7.5 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center 
&gt;at 800
&gt;RPM (Revolutions per minute). The centrifugal advance works like it 
&gt;should
&gt;and progresses the timing to 28 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center at 3000 
&gt;RPM.

Timing _advance_ is when ignition occurs earlier (more BTDC). What 
you're describing is timing _retard_. You're obviously confusing the 
two - a VW engine won't run 28 degrees ATDC at 3000 RPM.
