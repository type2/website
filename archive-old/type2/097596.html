Subject: Re: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

Oh yeah!!! Well Ron actually chartered a 747 full of NOS parts for my 72
Westy and personally did a ground up resto right in front of me while
supplying free beer and dancing girls. Then he refused any payment, gave me
his first born child, donated a million dollars to the Cancer Fund, and gave
me his American Express Platinum Card. Beat that!!! :-)
