I am doing a set of rims as we speak.  I had them sandblasted ($10) a rim
(both sides of rim), then por-15'd the whole rim, now I am lightly sanding
them to apply the color I want.  then next week I will go have the new tires
put on.  I left the old tires on for now.  I have not had a tire store mess
up a freshly painted rim.

that's the way I am doing it anyway

&gt; While I wait for my AVP Engine I wanted to start on the rims and need for
&gt; tires. The rims on my bus are fairly heavy with surface rust, I want to
sand
&gt; blast them and paint them. I will sand blast them with the old tires on
the
&gt; rim, However I was wondering in what order should I paint them. Before I
get
&gt; the new tires so I dont have to worry about over spray ; or will they get
&gt; beat up when I take them to get tires? Or should I have the tires mounted
to
&gt; the clean sandblasted rims, mask the tires, and then paint?
&gt; Never done it so don't know, if you do please fill me in, THANKS.
