Subject: Re: Wire for Sump Oil Temp Sender (was &quot;Oil Temp, Safe or Not?&quot;)

In Response To:
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've had the same wire running under my bus since I put the gauge in
about twelve years ago.  The insulation has stiffened and cracked a little
at the end but otherwise it is in good shape, and I've done my fair share
of rough-roading in the bus.  The wire does not hang down below sump
level.&lt;&lt;&lt;

David, what do you use as insulation for your under-bus oil temperature
sender wire?  I've always wondered about that little detail and have never
seen anything about it here.  (If anyone else has input to this, please
contribute as well.)  Thanks!
