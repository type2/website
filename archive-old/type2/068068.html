Dave,

A couple of data points for you decision:

Yesterday, Pat Flynn and I went out and looked at a '78 at a local
breakers (junk) yard.  I bought the sliding door (no window, no rust
bubbles, one bent corner w/surface rust there) for $40US.  This has been
my standard solution to rusty doors, tho I suspect that with time this
source will dry up.  

I got an estimate of ~$500 back a bit for re-skinning and repainting a 3&quot;
strip along the bottom of a sliding door.

If a used door is the wrong color, repainting is ~$200 assuming you strip
and prep it.  

While all breadloaf doors will *fit* all breadloaf vans (in my experience
{'72-'79}), the lock and handle mechanisms changed substantially thru the
years, and you may be forced ito carrying more keys than you are
comfortable with. 

Just grist for the mill.  If you can't find any good used doors, then
re-skinning is really your only option, but it will be expensive.
