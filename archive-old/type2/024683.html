So after a year of driving on an AVP rebuild, and learning some of the ins
and outs of a '76 Westy with a Type IV, the time has come for me to tackle
my own rebuild job.  I want to do this once, and do it right, but seeing as
this is my first rebuild, I won't exactly know what right is until I've made
the mistakes.  That's where you guys come in.  Here comes a big list of
questions (sorry if some of this is in the archives, but I have searched for
a couple of hours and only ended up confused).

Here are my requirements (or wishes - depends on what is achievable):
* I would like a little more power - enough to get me through the mountain
passes without lagging uncomfortably behind traffic (this scares my wife too
much) - we're talking 50-55 on most grades without overheating.
* I want reliability and maintainability - read FI, hydraulic, engine that
lasts 100,000 miles with good maintenance (I see some 200,000+ engines on
the list, and the one that I took out of my bus last year had 201,000 - can
a rebuild last that long?)
* Cost isn't too much of an issue - a $4000 engine is a lot less than a new
car - and is very good value if it lasts 200,000.
* I don't need the heat from the heater boxes, I have a BN-4 for that - so
is there a better exhaust system to use?

Is something like this doable?  If yes, then suggestions on sources for
heads (Reichert?), cases (Reichert?), valves, cranks (Demello? Scat?), P&amp;C
(Mahle?), cams (Engle? Webcam?) etc... would be appreciated.

This is starting to seem like way too many questions for one email, and I
still haven't touched on any of the stuff about
porting/polishing/unshrouding/CCing heads, CW vs. standard cranks, shot
peened rods etc... (ie what the heck is all of this stuff and do I need
it/want it?), so I'll sign off for now.

Thanks,
Niall
