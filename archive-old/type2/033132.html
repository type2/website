I believe you need 3/4&quot; plywood in the bus. Your closet won't quite reach
it's height of glory if you go thinner. On my bus, the rear seat needs 3/4&quot;
to work properly...but it's a Riviera with a different design than the
westy seat. Still, I think you'll run into the same problem. I had a '71
westy and I recall that when I replaced the floor I had to go thick rather
than thin.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;Being a single guy, i spent most of T-day gutting my 71 Westy and
&gt;discovering all it's flaws and relative lack of rust etc. Nice shape,

&gt;the metal and the bus is empty and now clean and scrubbed.

&gt;am considering a fiberglass reinforced white sheet panel that they sell,
&gt;as it would be waterproof, easy to handle and non directional. Any
&gt;comments on this? no wood product in it at all... Sounds good, and at
&gt;$24 per sheet, priced ok. also found an really good looking carpet rem
&gt;for the floor after i replace the underlay. I'll put this down and then
&gt;replace the Westy stuff for a good look. I was also going to use the
&gt;extra carpet to  cover the metal over the motor area for a bit of noise
&gt;insulation, 
&gt;
&gt;Short of brute force, how do you get the headliner wood out? Slide it
&gt;forward? pull down then push edge out? Trick here?  It's in good enough
&gt;shape to use as a pattern, as is most of the old wood panelling.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the info as i read the digest. This is a fun project.
