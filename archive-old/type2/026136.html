I just did that job last weekend.  I'm not surprised you had trouble if you
used the standard 5.5mm hose, the vent pipes are too big for that.  I don't
know what the official VW size is, but I used 1/4&quot; (6.35mm).  Went on a
treat.  That one up on the left hand side near the bulkhead is a bit of a
pig to get at though.

&gt; I can't get the little #_at_*%!!! two inch hose joints reinstalled on the
&gt; gas tank vent tubes. (Using new VW fuel hose.)
