Subject: Re: [T2] funny sign

I heard a story several years ago that Bill Gates bought a brand new  Jaguar.  This was after he got rich but before he got super  rich.  Of course it leaked oil and he never checked it.  He  drove it down to San Francisco to a meeting and burned up the  motor.  When they told him what the problem was, he just traded it  in on another one.  Must be nice.   Cheers....KR


Along that note, the company next door has done
repairs to Microsoft Bill's Lexus several times. The
doors on that thing must weigh 500 pounds each! The
window is prob an inch thick. -BaH
