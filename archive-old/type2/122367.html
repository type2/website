&gt; How and where can I

Travis,  

Like George I think said, you have to take the handles completely off the
bus, then take them all apart, clean and lubricate, then re-assemble. This
sounds difficult, but it isn't, really. They are easy to remove and simple
to take apart and put back together. One trick I use is to make sure you
have a key installed in the lock cylinder when you are removing it from the
handle, this will prevent the lock wafers from sproinging out on you. I use
a small jar of lacquer thinner to soak them in and you can shake everything
up to help remove the goop.

Taking the locks apart in this way will fix your problem for good, and if
you are breaking keys then the problem is severe. Spraying lubricant inside
them on the bus will not help at all if they are gummed up, it may actually
make the problem worse.
