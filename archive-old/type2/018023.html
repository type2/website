   Seems like it should work that way. I wonder if it's precise enough
to make it a viable fuel enrichment device for the turbo. That would be
pretty neat.

&gt; Hmm, interesting question!
&gt; Assuming that the regulator works so that at high vacuum (idle) fuel
&gt; pressure is lowest and at low vacuum (WOT) fuel pressure is highest,
&gt; seems like manifold pressure would result in higher fuel pressure
&gt; because the manifold pressure would be pushing on the diaphragm in the
&gt; regulator, helping to keep the return line covered.
&gt; Am I thinking about this right?
