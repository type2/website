&gt; Hydraulic lifters will make a fair bit of noise when you first fire up a
&gt; newly rebuilt engine until they &quot;pump up&quot; that is until they get full of oil
&gt; and lift up to the required height.... those first few seconds sound
&gt; terrible but when they pump up the engine should quieten down a whole heap.
&gt; Also when the engine sits for a while you may get some tappet noise until
&gt; the lifters &quot;pump up&quot; again, this should only be for a second or two as
&gt; well.

if you hear hyd noise after they are pumped up if you hear em while
driving your engine is being oil starved.  find out why, fast.

one cause is lugging the engine on a grade
