Subject: 81 brake master cylinder

The mc leaks. Seems to be unrelated to braking but the plugs or seals that
the fluid resevoir fits into seem to be wet. I suspect those plugs are tired,
it's a matter of a few drips a day. Is this to be expected?

It looks like those can simply be replaced by pulling the resevoir and
fitting new plugs without actually removing the mc. Are those available
somewhere?

Thanks,

Weston
