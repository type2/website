I hope that this is not considered too far off-topic, but I had an
opportunity to visit the show (I'm in town for another trade show).

I visited the VW booth, and am sad to report that the Neu Bus Concept was
not present.  I did, however, speak to a VW rep about it, and the impression
that I got was that they were hoping to bring it, but did not end up doing
so.  (But implicit in the comment was that the beast *does* exist!)

Anyhow, just thought I'd report to the list -- I apologize in advance for
the wasted bandwidth, if it is considered such...
