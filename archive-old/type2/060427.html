Subject: Re:sagging rear ends  - westie t-bars

&gt;Also applicable to the sagging rear end question is the different rear
&gt;torsion bars that VW used.  Did you know that the panels and Westies got
&gt;heavier-duty torsion bars in the rear than the passenger vans??  My
&gt;passenger van was sagging severely, but my Westies have all been quite
&gt;level!  Something to consider next time you see a Westy in a junk yard!


I have now stripped three different hard-top campers, 70-72 (don't worry: a
rollover, a crushed rearend and a sat-in-the-mud rustbucket!); all had the
same torsion bars as my 9 passenger. The paint dots on the end were red as
I recall...

I think the heavier bars had brown paint on them (might have this reversed).

Seems VW thought all the extra weight from poptop and body reinforcements
was greater than hauling 9 people + luggage around.
A little odd, too, they felt a hardtop camper would be less-heavily loaded
than a popup.

Something to keep in mind if you go looking for a van to grab heavier tbars
out of - don't waste your strength with anything save a pop-top!
