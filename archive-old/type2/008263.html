&gt;Not the dash lights or the radio, just the headlights. I was within
&gt;yards of an exit that would take me home so I
&gt;pulled off. As I continued on the exit ramp the lights went ON! and all
&gt;was fine. About 1/4 of a mile later the lights went out again and then
&gt;back on. This happened two more times then the lights stayed on for the
&gt;remainder of the ride home.
&gt;Q. Do I have a short?
&gt;Q  Is this my Alternator?
&gt;Q  Do I have a loose wire?
&gt;Q. Can I replace the Alt without removing the engine?
&gt;
&gt;Has this happened to anyone else? Or does the bus have Gremlins?
&gt;Thanks for any help!

I am restoring a '69 Westy and while doing the electrical system I 
constantly had similar problems.  Each time I would shake my head and 
begin to trace the problem only to have the lights come back on without 
me doing anything.  As it turned out I had a couple of BAD fuses, but 
not BLOWN fuses.  The metal strips in the fuses were so old and brittle 
they would sometimes carry current and sometimes they woudn't.  They 
looked fine, but when I removed them the metal strips would crumble at a 
touch.  For a few bucks I replaced all the fuses regardless of how they 
looked.  Now my lights work very reliably and they are also much 
brighter.  This may not fix your problem, but definitely won't hurt.
