What a great source of information this list is!!  Within 15 minutes, I had
the answer, twice (from Karl and Jeffery Adams, thanks guys!!!!), and
probably more to come.  The answer was a missing ground.  I just went
outside and hooked up at temporary ground wire.  Everything worked GREAT.  I
now need to make the temporary connection a permanent one, and I need to
replace the turn signal switch (it has some wires broken off of it, and I
can't see where it was supposed to go, but it's the wire that switches to
high beams.  I also need to replace a bad headlamp, and clean the
connections to all the bulbs for the break lights and running lights.  Man,
I am happy now.

I still need to verify the timing, dwell, and adjust the carburetor so that
it will run just a bit leaner.  The exhaust smells very strongly of unburned
fuel.  Which adjustment do I need to make?

Take care,
Stuart
