#17 is the white pair of wires that connects to the block underneath the
throttle body ( above cyl #3).  Are there contacts in the harness plug to
the ECU for 16 &amp; 17?.

It comes off the harness at the same place as the Cold start, thermo time
switch and the Aux air valve.  I don't think your engine will run without
these?

Have fun
