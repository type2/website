Subject: RE: [T2] So what does this mean for parts?

So maybe EV parts may become reasonable (but made
in Mex or Brazil)?

VW VAN PARTS FORMULAS

Bus Parts= Reasonable price for the item + $10
shipping and handling + a 1-12 week wait

Vanagon Parts= Reasonable price for the item x 3
+ $45 + $10 shipping and handling + a 1-24 week
wait.

Eurovan Parts= Double the cost of vanagon parts
plus 1-12 month wait.

&gt; &gt; So what does the elimination of the VW
&gt; factory in Brazil mean for
&gt; &gt; all of us who own Air Cooled VW busses?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They're not actually eliminating all
&gt; manufacturing there, just production of
&gt; the Bus.  This was not exactly unforseen.  When
&gt; VW tooled up for the EuroVan
&gt; in Brazil, the handwriting was on the wall for
&gt; the Bus.  It seemed very
&gt; unlikely that they would continue Bus
&gt; production along side of it.  Every
&gt; consumer product has a life cycle, and
&gt; certainly the Kombi has had a longer
&gt; one than almost any other vehicle.  Ben Pon
&gt; should be proud that his modest
&gt; design continued production straight into the
&gt; 21st centrury.
&gt; 
&gt; As for what it mean to us:  Short term,
&gt; nothing.  For some time, replacement
&gt; parts will continue to be made, to support
&gt; those busses that were recently
&gt; sold. When VW discontinued the German bus in
&gt; 1979, it was several years
&gt; later before they began obsoleting parts for
&gt; it. For a number of years you
&gt; could still get most Bus parts at your VW
&gt; dealer (if, of course, you were
&gt; willing to pay the price).  However, as was the
&gt; case with bus parts here,
&gt; eventually VW/Brazil will of course stop
&gt; supplying replacement parts for a
&gt; discontinued vehicle.  So in the long run, it
&gt; will mean that some parts will
&gt; either become unavailable, or available only in
&gt; the aftermarket.
