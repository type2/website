Brandy, I see you attend the University of Hard Knocks. I'm working on my
degree down here at the Memphis campus. I'm hoping to study with Ken Hooper
(maybe even this weekend). I wouldn't take it too hard; maybe it's just
&quot;tough love&quot; from your bus. ;)

&gt;1) how do you keep the flywheel from turning when you want to remove

There's this $8 tool called a flywheel lock. (I've only worked on 1600s, so
forgive me if this doesn't apply to you.) I thought I'd attempt an ASCII
illustration, but this isn't really very good. If you have the Busboys or
RMMV (Bus Stop) catalog or other, look it up--a picture's worth a thousand
characters. You can fabricate something to do the same job, but you may also
be able to get a flywheel lock reasonably at a local shop. If it looks a lot
like the one I've drawn here, don't buy it. It'll never work!

You bolt the flywheel lock onto one of the four bolts that attach the engine
to the transmission bellhousing, positioning the &quot;teeth&quot; of the flywheel
lock so that it catches the teeth of the flywheel. Tighten the nut on the
bolt snug so the lock doesn't flex or work it's way off. This keeps the
flywheel from turning as you remove the gland nut or the pressure plate.

Note: when you remove the pressure plate, do it slowly. Turn quarter turns
on opposite sides at first. Work up to half turns after about 3 times
around. Your objective is to not spring the pressure plate. Wilson has the
steps for this. You'll need your torque wrench to install the pressure plate.

Another thing you'll have to do is support the engine so it doesn't tip over
when you loosen the gland nut. There are a variety of ways to do this. I
tend to use a gorilla and a strong piece of metal bolted to the bottom bolts
that attach to the bellhousing. A heavy gorilla is handy for many chores,
but don't let them use the hammer! You'll have to figure this out based on
what's handy. Long angle iron works. So does a modified support off of a
heavy non-VW roof rack 8).

You'll need longer arms to get the gland nut off, so find that piece of pipe!
Have you thought about what you're going to do when you get it off? How are
you going to get it back on to check end-play? You have the oil seal?

I highly recommend Tom Wilson's book if you don't already have it! It
answers many of these questions, and the publishers thought enough of his
work to put it in print. If Bob wrote a book, though, I'd buy that first.
He's one of my favorite writers!

Once you get the gland nut off, take the flywheel lock off and wiggle the
flywheel off. Unless the dowels are worn or the holes for the dowels are too
big, you won't be able to notice the flywheel wiggling much at first.
Eventually, it'll come off. If you have to use leverage, be gentle. Don't
mess up your case trying to pry off a flywheel. Wiggle til you giggle. ;) Joe

PS. There may be other, better ways. Sometimes I think I'm the Forest Gump
of the list. My mother used to tell me &quot;Son, get me that box of chocolates....&quot;
