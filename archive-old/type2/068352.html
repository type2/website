Subject: Most useful air tools

This question is for all of you who use air tools.  What tools to do find
most useful.  I believe most of the work performed will be mechanic work
but I am interest in hearing about everything.  So far I am looking towards
an impact wrench or a rachet.  What else is there?
And yes, I have a compressor and tank that should be able to run most air
tools, I just have no tools yet.
