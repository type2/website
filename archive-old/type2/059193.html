Subject: oil filter location on '71 bus

Hope this hasn't been beaten to death, but can
someone advise on where they put the oil filter on a
'71 bus?  I tapped my case for a full-flow system
last year, and am in the process of making some other
repairs and would like to move the filter out of the
engine compartment.  Gene Berg says to mount the
thing on the engine cross member, but how it fits,
they shed no light. Seems too tight to mount it
behind and left of the cross member, and no way it
fits in front of the cross member as the muffler is
right there. The Empi mounting bracket I'm using has
the inlet/outlet ports facing left.   How have you
folks mounted it?
