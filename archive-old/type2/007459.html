&gt; George,
&gt; 
&gt; I believe your logic makes sense.  But what about the concern that the
&gt; steering box is at the mid-point of its range when driving straight
&gt; ahead?  Is this critical on a newly rebuilt box, or just on a used box
&gt; which may have begun to establish a center wear point?

The problem here is that the pitman arm travel is just barely enough
to take the steering between its physical limits (locks).  If you go
to either side of the center position you will find the steering
limited by the worm in the box, not by the stops on the swing lever. 
I have a feeling (not substantiated, but I don't feel like risking
$300 to find out) that allowing the box to go to the end of the worm
is damaging if it hits the end with any force.

Also, the steering wheel play is a minimum at the center position.  If
you use any other position, you will have more play in the steering
wheel while driving straight.  If the box is later adjusted at the new
&quot;center&quot; position, it will be too tight at the real center position.

&gt; I think I'll start with a correct toe-in adjustment, adjust the drag
&gt; link so the wheel stops are making contact at each extreme and then
&gt; adjust the steering wheel accordingly. The turn signal canceller
didn't
&gt; cancel correctly before or after the steering box replacement, so I
&gt; guess I can deal with that when the steering wheel is off.  Another
&gt; puller! -- is it a good thing to spend more on tools than parts?

If you come up with a VW steering wheel puller you will have dozens of
newfound close friends wanting to borrow it, including myself!  The
&quot;official&quot; VW puller is in the &quot;hens teeth&quot; catagory of rareness. 
Fabbing one shouldn't be too difficult if you are properly equipped.
