&gt; My fi 78t2  does about 4000 rpm at about 70 mph. doees this sound right.

This has everything to do with what diameter tires you are running both in the front (for speedo measurement purposes) and in the rear (for the actual
revolutions per mile). I've driven '70 and '71 Busses for a number of years assuming that 185R14 was the gospel but I recently found that before VW started
offering radials on new Busses the bias ply tire they used actually had a bigger diameter (fewer revs per mile). During the early days of radials VW
actually had the bias tire listed as stock for the 'working class' Bus and a radial for the 'luxury class' Bus. Yet, while these 2 versions obviously rolled
down the road at different revolutions per mile there were no differences between them for the tranny, engine, or speedometer. I came to the conclusion that
the speedometer on a radial equipped luxury class Bus of that vintage is actually incorrect and when it says you're going 70 you are probably only going
about 67 AND your engine is spinning higher RPMs to achieve it.  So I went looking for tires that match the diameter of the earlier bias tires (about 26.1
inches) and ended up with 205/75 14. Now when I go down the highway at 65 I actually blend right in with the traffic and my engine isn't working overtime to
get there.

Since that time I have acquired an '84 Vanagon which, with the 185R14 tires does not exhibit the same symptoms. The engine speed is not up in the high rev
zone and the speedo seems relatively accurate when compared with surrounding traffic. I have a feeling that VW, at some point between '71 and '84, changed
either the gearing or the speedo or both to reflect the new tire diameter in use.
