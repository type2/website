&gt; This is important discussion, especially with Kelly voting for welding! I
&gt; was told that the rivet/adhesive approach avoids any of the heat problems
&gt; with welding, and is actually a stronger repair.

&gt; Disclaimer: I don't know jack about rivet/adhesive OR welding. ;)

&gt;    Either method is superior depending on the skill of the mechanic...
The Morgan Aero 8 has a bonded and riveted chassis, but those 
aren't Home Depot rivets and a Harbor Freight rivet gun, either...
AFAIK, the adhesive also requires proper prep and careful temp-
erature controlled curing.
Same goes with welding...IF you know what you're doin' ...Buying 
a Craftsman 110v welder and reading the directions ain't gonna
make you Ron Covell... ;-(
