What is so tough about using the archives??
Go to www.type2_dot_com and click on archives, select
type2. Type in 'child cot bars' and the FIRST item
that comes up is this one:

Subject: [T2] Westfalia Child's Hammock -- Cot

Karl [aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net] p-mailed me some
info that I think should be in
the archive.  I have edited it for clarity and
key-worded the subject:
 
68 - 79 Westfalia Child's Hammock info:

*	The half-moon mounting brackets are the same from 68
to 79 -- 2
lefts and 2 rights.
*	68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4&quot; long.  68-73 were stored
above the right side cabinet.
*	Your 68 bars should be round and black.
*	Starting in 69, they were 3 sided galvanized steel
-- much stronger.
The round ones bend very easily......
*	74 and up, the half-moons were moved lower on the
posts.
*	From 74 you would need bars that are 57 1/4&quot; long.
*	74-75 bars are one piece and store below the full
width bed/bench seat.
*	76-79 bars are 2 piece collapsible. The reason is
because of where they are stored. The bed/bench seat
is 3/4 width.
