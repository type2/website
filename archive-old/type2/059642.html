&gt;Fascinating Catalogue!

These folks carry repop heater tube bellows for early bays, to my knowledge
they are the only source. I got a pair by way of a listee with a big order
last year, the quality was good.

But look, UK people help me with this:

It says here you can get a 34 PICT-4 which is not available in the US but
is just what we think, a late carb for a 1600, for L99, which would be
something around $88 US? Did I get that right?
