&gt; why not just use a  batttery operated Sawzall.  they are cheaper and
&gt; easier to use than the hook up you planned.  not to mention the fact that
&gt; you could recharge the battery right from the bus lighter socket if needed

I don't have a sawzall, and I am only investing in the portable power supply
and the inverter.  And a lot of times I used a battery screwdriver  where I
should have been using a higher speed drill....

I would use a grinder/cutting wheel to take out the base of a swivel seat,
or these little buggers.

I may be able to use this for some other junk yard cutting, and thanks to
Billy Price, I can guestimate my time at 30 minutes of full out
cutting/grinding.  Heck, I can even drive out to the country to do my
grinding now!!

The portable power 950 can be recharged from a 120V plug, or lined in with
the cigarette lighter while driving.

Yes, there are better ways, and probably cheaper ways, but if that was my
concern(s), what the h%$l am I doing driving a 1978 VW bus!!!

Barry says, let the adventure begin (I have AAA deluxe and I am secure)
