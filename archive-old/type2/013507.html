I figure i'll run a rad out of a toyota truck (22r -2.4L - the next conversion
idea if this one works out) and run the 12v fan all the time - angle the rad
down towards the front so it'll scoop a little - maybe run the fan so it sucks
up through it rather than blowing down, so as not to counteract the natural
airflow...
Is there a vacuum under a bus?

Not gonna tweak on the tranny. I figure if i beat up a $500 suby engine, its
still better than beating up a $1000 vw engine...
The 3-rib tranny is $150-200 around here...rebuilt even.

Once i get all the mounting/wiring/exhaust worked out, the replacement will be
cake - *if* i kill it...

thanks,
clark

I have read somewhere that any horizontal radiator arrangements will have 
to be several times bigger than the original vertical radiator for your 
powerplant. Many cooling fans for traffic?

It can be done but will require creative guessing towards the size 
necessary to keep your engine cool.

You might also look at your gearing in your tranny. You may be able to run 
the later bus tranny which is stronger (I've heard) and will have a 
slightly higher gear ratio.
