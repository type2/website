Subject: Oil cooler question

Thanks Scott. I guess that's why Bentley makes no mention of them as
spacers. I can't believe that the chilton manual says they are spacers and
are required to keep from squashing the seals too much. Ouch. I don't know
if I'll ever open that chilton again!

&gt; &gt; My question is, could these spacers be keeping the seals from being
&gt; &gt; compressed
&gt; &gt; enough to do their job?
&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; They are not spacers, they are thick washers. They go on the outside of
&gt; the
&gt; cooler, there is also a wavy washer on top.
