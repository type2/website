Subject: [T2]Higher oil Temp gauge?

just curious if past couple days on the east coast since its gotten hotter past couple of days....has anyone elses oil temp gauge went up  more... ?
i mean i know its hotter outside but heres what i experienced...
 
day before yesterday the oil temp gauge took no time to reach 220 and then beyond to a scary point of almost 240... i usually run at the hottest day so far right at 220 usually not even above it.... but maye touch 220..... this day and yesterday it went up past that,....
i went to stop at a redlight and the bus acted like it was going to cut off and the idle had went low on me...?
the oil light then begin to flicker only the oil light not the battery or etc...
 
its time for a oil change and thats what i am going to do tomorrow. maybe oil has gotten really thin cause of the extreme heat this year... 7000 miles on a new motor.... got less than 7000 miles on it at the most very high estimate....
 
so could she just of been running hot when the oil light came on.... ??
i was able to give a little gas and she purred but the oil temp was still high or to me it was and the light went out ......
 
she did that to me yesterday also with very little driving....
 
is this normal....?
its been hot past couple of days though very hot so hot i can ride down road with vent open and windows and still dripping sweat.....
 
does this sound common and just what i described a hot engine,..?
if so... besides a external oil cooler what else are my options here to get her cooler if that is whats happening...?since its gotten hotter(climate)..
 
she still seems to be running fine besides the occasional jerk maybe.... on take offs... but i think that might be my rotten need to be fixed ball joints..and sway bar bushing etc.. assembly...?
 
 
thanks
cha
