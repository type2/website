I too have been lurking on this thread, and thought it about time to thrown 
in my .03 (I work in the wonderful world of publishing, and therefore feel 
my opinion has a little more weight.)

I won't bore you with how things work in the real world of freelance 
writers, except to say that being treated like sh** by ANY magazine is par 
for the course for freelancers. They are regularly exploited, underpaid, 
sent to do the crappiest work, promised the moon then blown off, etc. So 
Kathy--don't take it personally. For all you know, the article could have 
been killed because it was lost, because an advertiser killed an ad and the 
magazine lost some space, because the editor working on it is considered a 
jerk at the office, because it was submitted in a format the editors 
couldn't handle, etc., etc., etc. Knowing first-hand how many things can 
stand between a good article and publication, I would be very hesitant to 
jump to the conclusion that they dumped you because you're a woman, or 
because of a lack of eye candy in your shots.

On the other hand, Trends has little regard for things like copy editing, 
style, spelling, editorial integrity, etc. Maybe they dumped you because 
you'd make the rest of the mag look bad.

Freelancing sucks. I've been there, and am glad I don't make my living doing 
it anymore. Now I survive by dealing with freelancers, and I make it a point 
to try and treat them better than I was treated. (No, I don't work for a 
VW-related publication.)

Keep after it and you'll get it published.
