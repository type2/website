X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey All,
  I was lucky to have been off work this last week and my wife took the kids
down to Oregon to spend time with her family. So I stayed behind and worked
on the 71 Westy. 
  What started out to be a simple engine swap and rust hole repair turned
into a week of late nights and busted knuckles.
I wanted to repair a rust hole above the right rear wheel, I started to
remove the paint and found that there had been a lot of damage done other
that just rust. Some time back the bus had been hit right at the sliding
door. The pilar at the rear of the door had been smashed and not repaired
correctly. I ended up cutting out the pilar, the inner support, and all ,
all the way to the floor. I then removed the quarter panel from the gas
filler down, from the slider back to the rear corner seam. All this was
replaced with stuff from a donor 73. I also found rust in the inner fender
that had to be cut out and removed.
   My engine swap did not go any better. It sounded simple, pull th motor
out of the 72 Bug and install it into the 71 Bus. The rear engine support
was my only concern, as it turned out, it was no big deal. I pulled the
engine and found that the Bug motor had the mount bosses, but no holes. I
had a hard time finding the right tap and drill but it went OK. I did not
want to use the Bug muffler so I started to install the header type system I
had and before I even got the brand new nuts to touch the flange, one of the
studs broke. Iwelded a nut to the stud and it broke again, I did it two more
time only to break more and more stud off. I then used my die grinder and
cut it flat and drilled and taped it out. Once the muffler was on I tried to
hook up the intake manifold heat risers. No luck. after two hours with the
torch and welder I made it all work. I slid the engine over to the Bus and
$^%$^%$, I forgot the Bus had a Vacuum powered brake booster, the Bug
manifold had no port. So I swaped the manifold. As I was putting it together
I remembered that I had a good Alternator I wanted to install. So I added
that. Once I got that together and ready to go I reached up to do something
with the carb and found that the carb linkage hits the Alt!!! Now I am
angry, I rip off the stuff one more time and grab the Kadrons off the shelf
and put those on. This is only about half of the thing that went wrong(like
removing the Aircleaner shelf), but the others are to hard to discribe. 
  However, I got it all installed last night and took it for a drive, Holy
smokes!!, that Kadron/Exstractor setup works fantastick on that Bus. I have
not had that kind of power in a Bus before and it is great. I will start to
drive it regularly tomorrow and see how it does after I get it all dialed
in. 
  My brother and I are working on a new web page also. It will show all the
work on my Bus, Bug and Vert. It will also show pics of my shop and stuff I
have for sale from time to time. It should be up and running around the end
of Jan. And thanks to Brian Tipsword for donating a scanner, I can load pics
of all this stuff.
