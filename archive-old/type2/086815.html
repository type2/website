yes you can do it with the engine in.

I changed mine out on my 78 without touching the engine removing only the
firewall and the air intake system down to the throttle body, which stayed
in place.

   I lay on the compartment and worked through the access hatch. it takes
skinny hands and many appropriate words of encouragement.  

   trick, it comes out easier (maybe the only way) to the side away from
the fuel fill.  getting that bugger back in with that sealing ring is the
ultimate PITA, give yourself all day

&gt; Hi guys, 
&gt; The fuel guage on my 77 9-seater Microbus is pretty
&gt; unreliable.
&gt; When you fill up the tank it's fine &amp; reads well down
&gt; to about half way.
&gt; Then the gremlin gets in the works and it goes on and
&gt; off like a yo-yo!
&gt; I took it to the auto-electricians yesterday and they
&gt; said they think it's the sender after examining the
&gt; guage.
&gt; Problem is, apparently the only way to reach the
&gt; sensor is either to cut through the floor or to remove
&gt; the engine, and to be honest, I'd rather avoid both
&gt; methods if at all possible.
&gt; I have nowhere to lay under the car at home &amp; so I
&gt; really can't do the work myself.
&gt; Will the engine have to be removed to get at it or is
&gt; there a tricky way to do it without such a major
&gt; manouvre?
&gt; If not, should I just wait until I get the clutch
&gt; replaced(probably later this year) &amp; have it repaired
&gt; then?
&gt; The problem about the fuel guage is that I live in the
&gt; country 20kms(12 miles) outside of town &amp; each run in
&gt; &amp; out uses a visible amount of fuel........I really
&gt; can't afford to not know how much is there.
&gt; Any clue would be a help.....
&gt; :-)
&gt; Cheers
