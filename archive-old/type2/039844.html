&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for your much-needed assistance.  I have a 1974 VW Westy
&gt;with a 2.0L, Carb, Pancake Engine.  If you went to Everybus, its the orange
&gt;one with the University of Florida Tags and Gator Sticker.
&gt;
&gt;Decided to clean the heat exchangers.
&gt;Drove Bus onto ramps to get room underneath.
&gt;Taking off heat exchanger and 2 nuts came off with 1/2 the bolt leaving
&gt;other 1/2 in heads
&gt;  Tried WD-40, Liquid Wrench, Propane Torch, Vice Grips, etc... no luck.
&gt;Cleaned and painted heat exchangers (used Rust-O-Leum High Heat Paint)
&gt;Put it all back together (minus 1/2 of two bolts).
&gt;Drove off ramps and cranked bus.
&gt;  LOUD!  LOUD!  LOUD!  Oh yeah, and it backfired a lot.  Especially after
&gt;hold throttle, let off, backfire.
&gt;  Puffing exhaust out from the cylinder where the bolts sheered off.  Also,
&gt;seems to be cooking my paint.
&gt;Feeling pretty bad and typing letter to Type2 friends for help.
&gt;
&gt;QUESTIONS!
&gt;1)  How do I get the bolts out?

If there is enough of a nub sticking above the case, a stud removal tool
will do it. A set of them in Chinese Cheese costs $30. Real ones cost real
money. They are not designed for removing broken studs, just for removal
and replacement of whole studs without damage to the threads. They look
like a deep socket with a cam action mechanism inside.

Try welding a nut to the nub, then turn it out with a socket.

If no nub, it's 50/50 for me to get it out with an ez-out. It requires
drilling precisely down through the center, nothing like easy to do without
pulling the head, and even then it takes a very serious attitude. 

Pull the head and take it to a machinist before you break off the ez-out. 

&gt;2)  Where do I get new ones (threaded on both sides, plain in the middle)

Any good stocked hardware store, except in Montana where metrics are
forbidden by the militia.

&gt;3)  Why is it backfiring?
Air getting sucked into the exhaust and mixing with unburned fuel.

&gt;4)  What kind of paint should I have used?
&gt;5)  Is the Bus safe to drive like this?

Valve damage is possable but not too likely. Answer=maybe yes, maybe no. 

&gt;6)  Is there any easier way to learn how to work on your own VW? (Can I get
&gt;a tutor?)

For $62 per hour plus expenses you could hire me. But I'm sure that's not
what you had in mind. Many Community Colleges have auto shop classes. Could
be a good value for getting basic knowledge quickly. Don't expect to be
using T-II's as project examples, though.

The list is the easiest way to go. It ain't no cakewalk.
