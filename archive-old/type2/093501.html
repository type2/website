Subject: Re: [T2] CA DMV auto dismantlers

I called on the bus and spoke with the dismantler.

Here's the deal

1. In the five years he's been running the program, he has never had a 
request to purchase the vehicle outright.  They just put them in the yard 
and part them out.  He is checking on the program and what the selling 
price would be to sell it as one piece.

2. In the absence of #1 happening, the bus will be put into the yard for 
stripping.  The same guy said that if #1 didn't work out, he would give me 
a heads up as to what day it would hit the yard after sitting for its 
mandatory waiting period.

The yard is located in Chula Vista

I'll keep the list posted
