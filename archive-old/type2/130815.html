Subject: re: [T2] Raby

Thanks, Jake, for your recent lessons.  I've been a T2 listmember for some
number of years now, and I don't recall seeing you post much before; I
sincerely appreciate your level-headed approach to breaking down the
technical aspects of the TIV.

While I will not likely ever actually *apply* the lessons, it has most
certainly inspired me to better understand my powerplant.  Oh, and I
absolutely will be submitting a workorder at Aircooled Technology when my
stocker 2.0 finally gives up the ghost.

Just my .02
