Subject: Re: [T2] Lopsided - not firing on all four

Chris,

I'm gonna ramble thru my thought process here...
Vacum gauge shows good...so probably not cam, valve or lifter
problems...hmmmm

I might check lift at the valves for #1 &amp; #2 just to be sure that you
didn't have something weird going on there....shorter/longer pushrod by
chance???

Rocker arm is not loose on that side? Correct rockers on 1 &amp; 2??

I am also assuming stock vacuum advance dist....if it is stock dist, then
timing for #3 should be a little retarded over the others....could you
have dist 180 degrees off and somehow have retard that is supposed to be
on #3 on #2?  I can't imagine such a thing, but it is worth checking the
timing on all 4(not just #1).  This will show spark on #2 as well...always
get spark, or is it missing cause no spark is getting there?...if the
timing light always shows spark(no dropouts) then probably something else.

Might also be why the 009 seemed a little better as there is not a retard
for #3 on 009 distributors(late model ones anyway).

Something in the intake causing the fuel to condense again(not be in vapor
state) on the way to #2?

You say that you switched plugs?  Try switching what you have between #1
and #2 and see if it follows the plug.

Try switching the wires between #1 and #2 and see what follows(if any).

Shrouded spark plug? from the head being rebuilt?  Spark plug not exposed
in the cylinder head properly?

Just my 2 cents.


Cheers, dave

&gt; This has been going on (intermittently) since the engine was rebuilt.  I have 
&gt; a few thousand miles on it now.  It was rebuilt last June, so obviously not a 
&gt; daily driver.
&gt; 
&gt; I got back the long block and then put everything back on.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cylinder #2 appears to be running cold.  It misses and the spark plug gets 
&gt; black quickly.  It's worse when cold, but seems to go away (mostly) when hot.
&gt; 
&gt; When I first got this engine back, I discovered a crack in the spark plug 
&gt; connector (Bakelite?), so I replaced all the spark plug wires.  Still there.
&gt; 
&gt; I've switched distributors without any noticeable difference (in fact, it 
&gt; seemed better with the 009).
&gt; 
&gt; I put in a new coil without any noticeable difference.
&gt; 
&gt; I switched spark plugs without any noticeable difference.  Spark plug gap OK.
&gt; 
&gt; Put in new points, condenser, cap -- no noticeable difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Timing good -- advances OK, either distributor.  Dwell at 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Sprayed everything along the respiratory system with ether while idling, no 
&gt; change.  A vacuum leak would make things run lean anyway, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Valves spot on.  Compression good with no intracylinder differences to speak 
&gt; of.
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum gauge shows a steady needle at idle -- about 15 mm Hg., which is what 
&gt; I've seen for every 1600 DP I've owned (and that's been since the '70s).
&gt; 
&gt; What am I missing?
