Subject: [T2]HighTop transport and questions

ok i have asked before but somehow did something with the email...?
  i wil ask again in hopes that i get as good as a answer as before or better,,.
   
  i am going to pick up a hightop up north but in case i cant make it i want to consider having it shipped... 
   
  now i know ups, fed ex or the likes might not ship something that big?
   
  btw this is just the top not the whole bus..
   
  it is the full adventurewagon top without the luggage rack indention in it like pictured here
  http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/medium/1121226.jpg
  ^excpet that one doe have tghe luggage rack in it but you cant really tell it from that angle...so the top i am getting looks like that ....
   
  i do not know a few things about this top like.
   
  how long? how wide? how tall is it? and how heavy?
   
  these are all things that will be accounted for if i have to ship it. oi even by me going to pick it up.. problem is i have a penthouse pop top so how i would carry it back would be a major concern.... i would thnk safety would be a issue if i tried to strap it to the bus on top of the penthouse top....????? thoughts here how to transport it back with a penthouse top already installed to the bus...? woudl it even fit with straps on top of the penthouse or just be to much,...?
   
  also can anyone reccomend someone that can ship it...since that might be a more seasonable thing to do i am thinking depending on cost of course and i would love to see the north sometime exspecially since it is finally warm weather up there...in new hampshire...
   
  i am right now looking at http://www.pakmail_dot_com/quote/  but i gotta know these types things in order to get a quote,,.,.,.?
   
  thanks for any or all help ... the type 2 list is a wonderful thing...
  peace and love
  chai
