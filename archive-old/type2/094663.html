Subject: RE: [T2] Gauges - final

Bob,

Not to insult you or anything, but I personally thing putting the gauges
under the dash is not a bright idea. I have learned from experience that
you need to keep an eye on gauges (saved my Mercedes 300D from an
untimely death many a time by watching them). Having them under the dash
would cause you to have to look down, and not see the road, whereas with
top of the dash you have some view of the road, with it under the dash
you would have none. Again, this is not to insult you, but it is just
what I see as being a logical reason not to put them under the dash.

&gt; OK, let me see if I can tell you what the pod is all about. The pod is

&gt; not VDO. I cannot find a VDO pod, so the pod from the supplier is a 
&gt; 3rd party sourced one that comes in either left or right angled meter 
&gt; mount. The pod I am getting would normally mount on the dash, and to 
&gt; the left side of the steering wheel, with the meters slanted to the 
&gt; right for easy viewing.
&gt; Upside down, it will mount so that the meters slant to the left.
&gt;
&gt; To my mind, but unable to see an actual installation, I sort of 
&gt; thought
&gt; the pod on the dash would be the way to go.
&gt;
&gt; Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod
&gt; being mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided 
&gt; configuration
&gt; mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then 
&gt; return the one I decide to not use.
&gt;
&gt; What you think ??
