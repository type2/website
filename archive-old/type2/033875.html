Subject: alternator/fuel pump rod

I had just put the finishing touches on the Tinkertoy and chuffled off
for her 1st drive in 5 years.  Made it 10 miles with a grin so big it
was probably illegal when she up and quit like she ran outta gas.  If
she sat she'd fire after a bit but promptly die.  I whipped out my
trusty AAA card and enjoyed a dinner that couldn't be beat at a total
strangers house waiting for the tow truck to come.  When we got home I
did the fuel pump output test and sure enough there wasn't any.  Pulled
the pump and the same damage, broken pump actuator rocker.  I found a
correct fuel pump rod and a new alternator style fuel pump and haven't
had a lick o'trouble in the fuel system since.
