Need a little help in finding a good mechanic in Colorado Springs.  My daughter lives there and her car has been broken down for about a month, she now has money to get it fixed but has only lived there a short time and has no idea where to take it that will not rip her head off.  No... it is not a VW..... it is an Old*mobile.  If any one can let me know I would really appreciate it.
TIA
