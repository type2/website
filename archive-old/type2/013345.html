Hi Sean,

I have an 80 Westy also.  It has a lot of ground
clearance and seems solid like a truck, so I agree it
would probably go places the EVC wouldn't.  Is your 95
EVC the type that has Winnebago cabinets (a Eurobago)?
 I wasn't aware that 95 EVCs came with a drivers air
bag.  With Eurobagos I thought 95s had no air bags at
all, and you had to go to the 97 V6 models to get
them.  What kind of mileage do you get with your 95,
and is it an automatic?

Rob
