Subject: busses in Tallahassee, FL

        I am looking at colleges now, and one of the factors (a minor one 
according to my parents) is whether or not I can take my bus with me.  If 
I go out of state(non-NC) then I would want my bus so I can drive back 
home for vacations and holidays, plane tickets seem to get expensive 
after a while(of course so does gas, but Im ignoring that fact right 
now).  I am seriously considering Fl State University, and want to know 
if there is a large bus populus there, and about mechanics.  I am just 
now taking my first autotech class, and only know basics.  When big 
problems happen, I turn to my dad, who will be 12 hours away, and can't 
just come over and fix it.  If anyone knows about busses in the 
Tallahassee area, Id appreciate any information you can pass on.
                                                Dallas
