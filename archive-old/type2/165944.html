Subject: Re: [T2] digital timing light power source...

Hey Bill,

Sounds like a necessity for the Great North American Extreme Bus Race!  Hey, the motorcycle guys stole my idea.  They have a Key West to Prudhoe Bay road rally for bikes coming up sometime.  I forget where I saw that.  Have a great weekend.  Cheers...KR

said that you can run a 12 v timing light on a portable 12 v battery and use
it to time a 6 v system.  That would be great for around the garage at home.

Okay, next question, anyone do this before?  Do you have to drag a full size
12 v car battery around on a road trip in a 6 v car in case you might need to
run the timing light, or can a small/tiny 12 v battery of some kind do the
trick?  What would work?  I know about those small 12 v jump start batteries
units about the size of a small briefcase, but I'm wondering about something
even smaller.

Ideas/experiences?

Thanks again!

Bill Bowman
