Subject: I Need Single Weber Jets!

Good day gentlemen's,
Am having fun with my single Weber right now, NOT!!!!
Well, am close to a good adjustment but i need bigger idle jet (Primary 
&amp; Secondary)
My carbs is a Single Weber progressive 32-36DFEV (pretty sure)

I was wondering, is there a place / part dealer that sell jets as a 
pair/single for the DFEV series and not the DGEV (un less they use the 
same jets and gasket kit).  The jets box is a bit on the expensive side 
(90$), i am only looking for 60, 65 and 70 idle jets.

Or if any of you guys have some to sell me???

Any web link?

Cheers, Ben
