This is a series of submittals addressing basic Maintenance Repair
and Restoration of European Vehicles, all of which owe homage to the
German Engineering Philosophy, hereinafter refered to as the
Deutsches Methode (DM).

All Porsche air cooled designs, including of course VW, can be provided
the best long term economy by understanding the mind of the good
Doktor Porsche and others of the German technical schools who practice
the DM.

Today we give you some brake inspection and service ideas and procedures.

German disc brake rotors, calipers and pads and wheels, tires and 
suspensions are designed as a harmonious unit with regard to materials.
If you use the soft black pads the vehicle originally came with, 
the original rotors will last through some 5 to 7 sets of pads
before reaching the minimum specified thickness. Your brakes will
never overheat or glaze or wear unevenly or score the rotors.
That assumes you are renewing ALL the brake fluid yearly to prevent
varnish, crud and coorosion from jaming the calipers which is the DM.
It also assumes that you are not having the rotors turned every time
you replace the pads, which is not the DM.

In fact, in most of the German factory manuals it will say that if the 
rotors show glazing or cracking or scoring, replace them. Uneven
but rounded wear patterns are not a problem when the proper pads are
used, but put in a set of those wizbang metalics and not only do you
eat up your rotors if you can stand the noise, they will never mate
during the break-in process. There is no rotor turning procedure
advised or given. You guys and gals check your Bently Official VW
manuals and find the pages that describe the procedure for the 
tuning of rotors. Take all day if you like. 

The brake specialty shops either have never read the factory procedures
or choose to ignore them. Every rotor gets turned every time. This 
gaurantees you will never get more than three sets of pads per rotor
replacement because most of the rotor width is taken off with the
lathe. Of course, if you are interested is selling rotors, that's the
way to do it. If you appreciate the economy of the DM, it's wrong.

You say you don't like that black dust on your wheels all the time.
DM says if your wheels are dirty, wash them. Rarely if ever will
you find these German pads or rotors at the FLAPS. There you will
get parts designed to be cheap cause that's what sells best in
America. Why do you suppose there are no NAPA stores in Germany???
Cause the German on the street will not buy Pakistani iron for
his properly engineered vehicle. German materials engineering is
not a triffling activity. If he wants an improvement in braking
he goes for the even more expensive factory update set of calipers
rotors, pads, wheels, tires and suspension as a harmoniously 
designed package. They don't just stick in a wizbang set of pads
to &quot;see what happens&quot; or cause they're cheaper, which is not the DM.

My 78 Mercedes 280CE now has 60,000 original miles. I put in the 
third set of pads last year. The rotors are original and show 0.5mm
wear. They have another mm or more to go before they will need
replacing. They never have nor will they ever be turned on a lathe
to help shorten their life. I flush the brake fluid before it turns
brown. They never make noise. They never pull unevenly. This is the
result of the DM.

A large percentage of the brake work I do every year is associated
with a recent trip to the Midas shop or fluid as black as carbon.
If one caliper or cylinder is leaking due to contaminated fluid
the WHOLE SYSTEM is contaminated. If you fix the one leak you have
a repeat customer for the other cylinders/calipers as they begin
to leak in the months ahead. How economical is that???? 

I've only had one comeback in the last ten years on a brake job.
The rear pads on this Mercedes sedan were at the 2mm wear limit.
The rotors were just thick enough that they could be expected to
last one more set of pads before reaching the minimum specified
thickness. I put in a new set of factory pads. Client complained
a few weeks later of squeeking. This was an occasional little 
itsy bitsy squeek just as the vehicle came to a stop.

I replaced the rotors and conditioned the pads with abrasive.
Problem solved. Let's see, that's one problem in perhaps a
coupla hundred brake jobs. This is the kind of efficasy provided
by the DM.

Stubborn rigorous adherence to specifications and procedures established 
by the team of German engineers who designed the vehicle is not 
an option if the DM is to be honored. The problems come with
compromise.

Questions, anyone??????
