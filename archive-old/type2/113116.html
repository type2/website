&gt; Frank,
&gt; Sounds to me like that's about right. Don't forget sticks usually only get
&gt; 20mpg or so. Autos get worse gas milage 

Hmm,, If we are speaking USA mpg,, I get the exact same mileage as Dave, 
I drive a '74 calif 1.8liter dual carb , points ign.,Manual trans, Westy Camper
usually Fully loaded for 5 people

Dave drives a '73 1.8 liter dual carb, points ign. AUTO trans, Westy Camper
usually 3/4 loaded 

we both get 20 mpg using the US gal, highway driving on U.S. interstates From
Buffalo to N.C. about 65-70mph

Check that you have the factory style distributor and that the advance is
working,, 

I agree with the rest of your thorough advice


&gt; Other tips to increase gas milage:
&gt; 
&gt;correct tire inflation ,Make sure your brakes aren't hanging up and your e-brake is off.
&gt; Make sure your bearings are smooth. Avoid jackrabit starts,
snip


&gt; But my guess is 14-17 mpg is about right...if you have a camper or weekender
&gt; or are hauling heavy loads, that also eats away gas milage.

I think 14 is pretty low... 

&gt; Always thought it would be a great study to see how much gas we burn in
&gt; America with our overweight population. 50 extra pounds has to amount to a
&gt; mile less per gallon or something like that?

I have recently installed a 2.0 liter with fuel injection, and increased the mpg
to about 22 miles per U.S. gallon
