&gt;I have a 78 bus; if you get the VW dealer oil filter (looks like an Audi
&gt;part), you can suck and push air through it like it has no valve.. The Beck
&gt;Arnley version from local FLAPS has some sort of a valve.  Since the filter
&gt;sits at the bottom, I don't think it needs an antisiphon valve, and prefer
&gt;the free-flowing kind...any comments??
I might not know what I'm talking about (having a filter-less '71 bus) but
I think the valve isn't so much an antisiphon valve as it is a pressure
bypass valve.  Ie. when the oil pressure gets super high (wrong weight oil,
super cold, etc.) a valve in the filter kicks in and takes the filter out
of the circuit.  Oil just flows in and right back on its way without going
inside the filter.  This prevents the filter from exploding.  But the thing
is, don't all later engines (DP 1600's and type IV's) have a valve in the
case to bypass the cooler/filter when the pressure's too high?
