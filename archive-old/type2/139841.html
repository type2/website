&gt; Also, at the local train store here in Reno they have

&gt; cool...about 50$ each, I'm sure I will get myself one soon.

I have actually seen one of these many years ago as a splitty and it was
here in the USA,  tried to buy the &quot;hy-rail&quot; gear from the person but I
was pretty broke at the time and the scrap dealer could offer him more
money than I could, it was pretty heavy steel.  somewhere  in my mess of a
slide collection I have photos of the thing..

oh and this was in the 12inch to the foot scale
