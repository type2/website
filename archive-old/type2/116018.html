&gt; I went to my VW dealer and asked for a gasket for a '78 and

&gt; Sooo..... the secret (other than to hurry!) is to ask for an '83 aircooled
&gt; gasket.  I made a page of the new gasket I picked up on friday and it is

I know Steve will find a way to find another one but I have to have to try
to have the final word.

As of Monday the VW parts warehouse in Dallas and only that one had 3 left.
As of Tue they had zero after some people ordered them. This item is NLA
through VW. No, I didn't get one if you're thinking of asking.
