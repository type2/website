&gt; I just found a complete bus motor (with FI) on craigslist this  
&gt; morning with new heads. It came out of a 1981 bus,

&gt;  I am considering putting this in my 72 westy for the timeb eing  
&gt; because if it is complete and serviceable it is cheaper then a set  
&gt; of fual carbs which my bus currently needs.

&gt; Before I plunk down any money I just want to be sure that the  
&gt; larger 2.0l isnt a problem to fit into cavity in my westy once I  
&gt; get all the FI crap installed too. I would much much rather have  
&gt; carbs on it, since i want to keep it nearly completly stock with  
&gt; the exception of the flooring and paneling, but finances currently  
&gt; do not allow for that heh

Gerry,

See my vacuum hose article. It shows how all the hoses route on 75-83  
FI models:
