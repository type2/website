Subject: 78 steering problem

Thanks to all (esp. to H Steven Dolan, Dan Soiney, johnny Stutsman, and
Robert Taylor) for the responses to my dash questions.

I'm also having a strange problem with the steering. The steering wheel
seems to get out of the proper alignment from time to time. In other words,
sometimes after we make a hard turn (either right or left), the steering
wheel does not return to the position it should be in for going straight.
The steering does not feel particularly loose (it's considerably tighter
than in our 74).

There is no play that I can discern in the horizontal or vertical planes of
the wheels (grasping the wheels at 3 and 9 o'clock, then 6 and 12). Also,
there is no grinding when we turn the steering wheel. It turns smooth
throughout.

Neither Muir nor Bentley explicitly address this problem, as far as I can tell.

Any ideas? Steering box adjustment? If the steering box is shot, will one
from a 74 work?

On the plus side, the bus is running great. On the last fillup, we got over
24 mpg. In the next couple months, we'll be working on patching up the
minor rust, getting the gas heater going, and generally preparing for
winter. This is our daily driver, and I wish to do what I can to keep it as
long as I can.

Thanks, as usual,
