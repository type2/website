Subject: '76 Engine FI questions

Hello Volks
Just spent the evening trying to figure out why the engine runs so
poorly in the'76 Westy I just bought for my son.  It idles real rich
and lacks power under accelleration       

1.) Compression measured cold was 135 psi all around. I assume this is
good?
2. Fuel pressure is 37 PSI with the vacuum line disconnected at idle
and 39 with it connected! (this appears to be way too high!)  The
manual says 28 and 35 and I'm getting 37/39! This would surely make it
run rich wouldn't it!

I assume I should plan to replace the fuel regulator... ?
One of the plugs appears clogged and causes the plug not to fire.(need
new plugs!)
3. The centrifical advance seems off. With the vacuum line disconnected
it hits the 7.5 BTDC spec at 950RPM... OK
At 1600 RPM with the vacuum disconnected the timing goes to 20 BTDC.
The manual indicates 9-14 degrees (BTDC or advanced from idle 7.5
degrees BTDC?). 
At 3400 RPM the timing shows 28 BTDC. The manual says it should be
21-25 degrees at 3400 RPM.
With the vacuum reconnected the timing is 20 BTDC _at_ 1600 RPM and 36 _at_
2000 RPM and 36BTDC. It tops out at 2200 RPM where it is 36 BTDC at
2200 RPM. 

Isn't this way too high?

Gary

Based on the VW Workshop manual the Timing should only be advanced 9-14
degrees _at_1600 RPM instead of 20 degrees.

The bus has very little power when I hit the accellerator. Could my
power problem be caused by too much advance? What would cause this
problem?

I appreciate any amd all responces to this inquiry
