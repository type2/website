&gt;2. I have a crankshaft pully from my original '71
&gt;engine.  Will the mark on the pully correspond with TDC
&gt;on the new engine?  If not, how do I find TDC since the
&gt;#1 piston's at TDC twice.  How do I keep from putting
&gt;the mark in 90 degrees wrong?  I know about the
&gt;screwdriver in the sparkplug hole trick, I'm just not
&gt;sure where to go from there.

At around $15, a degree wheel is a superb investment. It makes timing a LOT
easier, makes valve adjustments easier too. I would get one and not worry
about the old pulley. Be sure to get the stock sized one, not the little
teenybopper one.

You cannot put the pulley on wrong on account of a big Woodruff key.

&gt;3. How do I get the distributer close enough so that I
&gt;can start the engine and use my timing light?  I won't
&gt;be able to use a static timing light in setting the
&gt;engine up tomorrow since there'll be no power to the distributer...

First find the compression stroke of #1. Do this by removing the right side
valve cover (FIF) and watching the rocker arms while you turn the engine
clockwise with a ratchet. Watch for the exhaust (frontmost) valve to
depress, then for the intake to depress immediately after. The next time
TDC comes around, that's where you stop turning.

Now point the center of the rotor straight at the notch in the edge of the
distributor. That should get you fired up okay.

&gt;4.  The heat risers appear to be solidly clogged.  I
&gt;have read the archives, and St. Muir, and since I don't
&gt;have access to an acetylene torch, I wonder if someone
&gt;has discovered a miracle chemical cure.  I also wonder
&gt;if the whole thing's not worth worrying about too much
&gt;(some people have said enough heat gets transmitted
&gt;through even a fully clogged tube to keep the carb from
&gt;icing). Muir says clogged riser can burn a rod.  Why?
&gt;Don't most hot rodders close these off?

Some people ream them out with a frayed clutch cable chucked up in a drill.
Somebody was advertising a good manifold here just days ago for cheap, I
don't remember who. You need open heat risers or you will be yowling like
the people with Webers when the temperature starts to drop. 8) I have no
idea why a clogged heat riser would burn a rod or what that even means. 8)
