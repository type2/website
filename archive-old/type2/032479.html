&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any thoughts on how to cut

My wife has been trying to get me to cut down on wind noise in our bay window,
and split, and bedroom, and at the kitchen table!!!  (Sorry, but who can
resist a good fart joke!?!?) Anyway William, new window seals and seals for
the front fresh air flaps (behind the grill in the front) should help.  And
make sure that the &quot;belly pan&quot; that goes under the front of the cab is there. 
In my old 75 I used to get quite a good draft coming in through the holes in
the floor that the brake, shifter, and pedals went through.
