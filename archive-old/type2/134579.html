Subject: Injectors 82 Westi

List

While his school was out for Christmas, I was able to work on the boy's Westi.
Pulled the injectors and sent them to the Witch Hunter for cleaning and
calibration. They looked new upon return. There was a 10% variation on the
original test. After cleaning the variation was 1/2%. Installed in the engine
and it runs much better (smoother and quieter). While it was awaiting the
injectors, I looked into the annual overheating problems. Found and replaced a
missing seal (Thanks, Karl) between the air duct and the oil cooler, cleaned
and lubed the heater flaps and sealed all of the air leaks that could be
found. Valve adjust and valve cover gaskets soon.
