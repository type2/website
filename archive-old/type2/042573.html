Subject: Pop Goes the Camper

Hey Everyone,
This weekend we were camping in the local San Diego mountains and 
experienced a new problem with the '70 Westy.  When coming down the mountain 
,or on fast deceleration, the engine lets out a real loud backfire... POP!  
It only happened a few times, but it can't be a good thing.  Sounds like a 
hole in the muffler or loose exhaust connection. I took a look under the 
motor, but did not see anything obviously wrong.  No holes or loose clamps.  
I recently adjusted the valves and points.  It's been running just fine.  
This engine is a 1600 DP single solex carb with a header exhaust and a 
hide-out, tuck away muffler. I've had this setup for over 2 years with no 
problem.  Any suggestions on tracking this problem down would be 
appreciated.

P.S. My 12 year old son just set up little web page for me and he posted a 
few photos of our bus and others taken at the 2000 Classic Show last month. 
This is a work in progress, and more shots are coming.  There's one of Mike 
Visket's Westy, &quot;Itch&quot; too.  There were some nice buses that day.

Thanks,
Tom Riis
