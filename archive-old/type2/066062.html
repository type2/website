&gt;I agree with Anton and Amy's posts.  I, also, would like some solid statistics
&gt;about which scenerio pollutes the most.  It seems to me, that in the long
&gt;run, the person buying 4 - 5 or 6 cars in 20 years is going to end up
&gt;polluting/pillaging the environment far more than a person keeping 1 car
&gt;for 20 years.  But I don't have the statistics to prove it.  Can someone
&gt;please point to real data to enlighten me and others.  It's hard to con-
&gt;vince anyone without the facts.

well, aside from the amount of energy needed to melt the steel, aluminum,
and copper (for wire), and to injection mold the plastics, and shape the
glass, there is also the huge amount of pollution output by the human side
of manufacturing a new car:
- - all the designers who drew the plans drive cars, don't they? and their
  cars pollute.
- - all the financial whizzes in the car company who figure out how much to
  sell it for drive cars.
- - all the workers who assemble the car also drive cars.
- - all the cars go from the plant to the dealer on diesel trucks or trains.
- - and all the people who work at the dealership drive cars.

so in the process of building just one more new car, at least 100 (my own
estimate) automobiles are &quot;used&quot;.

now, admittedly, during one eight-hour shift, a LOT of new autos are built,
so the pollution from the workers autos is divided by that number. but still
it's a lot of cars. and it doesn't count all the roads that have to be
maintained for those cars to get to work at the auto plant. ;)

just a thought. :)
