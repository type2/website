Subject: 1973 1700: Can the EGR diaphragms be removed/blocked off?

One of the EGR diaphragms is leaking. Bad. In fact, it's keeping me from
driving the bus daily. :(

I will probably just cover it in high temp silicone for now, but since the
smog pump and other emissions equipment is missing anyway I thought about just
blocking them off. Anything I'm risking by doing that? Any tips?

Thanks!
Don
