Subject: Folly's rod's are stiff!

Hello all,

I have Folly's motor in the basement now and the dismantling is certainly 
a
slow progression.  The type 4 motor from the 72 westy was out when I 
bought
Folly.  I have no idea how long the motor was exposed to the elements, 
but
there was some water in the case when I pulled the oil drain plug.

Last night, I finally removed the pistons.  I had a strong friend 
struggle to
turn the crank via the flywheel and when the wrist pins were exposed, the
pistons were removed.    The crank was very difficult to turn, but I 
think
the culprit was connecting rod number 2.  All the rods seem to be snug on 
the
crank, but number 2 is tight.  I had to lightly tap the rod with a hammer 
in
order to make it move.   There is no discolouration that I can see but 
then
again, I have no idea of what I'm looking at.

I'll try to take off the rod (s) this evening.  I have a mechanic friend
coming over &lt; not a vw guy &gt;  to have a peek inside the case but from 
what my
rank amateurish eye can see it looks as clean as a whistle.

I guess the question is, what should I be looking for ?  With the pistons
removed the flyweel/crank moves like a dream, no grinding, nothing.

I'm lothe to crack the case but then again if you'd told me a week ago 
I'd be
removing pistons, I'd have laughed!
