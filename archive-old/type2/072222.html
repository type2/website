Subject: Re: [VB] Installation of front shocks

[...]
who is the best around for replacement shock bushings? i have a press, and
would like to put in lightly used KYBs, but the lower front bushings got
mangled on the way out.
thanks!   - steve

&gt;&gt;Liquid wrench
&gt;&gt;17mm &amp; 19mm wrench

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Apply pentrating liquid and remove bolts.  You may run into a problem
&gt;&gt;with the lower rubber bushing staying on the car and not coming off with
&gt;&gt;the shock, in which case you'll have to be creative in removing it.
&gt;&gt;I've had to cut some, others have come off with vice grips and cussing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Installation is the reverse of these steps.
