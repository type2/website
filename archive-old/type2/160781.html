&gt;&lt;&lt;What's so great about these Sears Craftsman?? Well, they are the
&gt;READABLE sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the
&gt;socket.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Huh---
&gt;If you can no longer see what size the socket is maybe you should
&gt;consider two things;
&gt;(A) a trip to the optometrist
&gt;
&gt;(B) Hang it up.
&gt;If you can't tell what size the socket is how in the heck are you going
&gt;to find the bolt? --: )
&gt;
&gt;Stevie Wonder and wrenching don't make it.

One of the toughest things of getting older is having the eyes get 
tired, damn hard to read the light engraving of the socket size sometimes.
Duluth Trading company ( http://www.duluthtrading_dot_com/ ) sells safety 
glasses with the bottom part being reading glasses of various degrees 
of magnification and at $30 they are affordable.

When I see someone poking fun because their eyes still read well I 
have to smile &amp; wonder if they will remember this when they are at 
the drug store shopping for their first pair of reading glasses.
