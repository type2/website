I had to take a blunt screwdriver / chisel and hammer to one of my star wheels.
Once I got it moving, after definately causing some minor damage, I resorted to
vice grips and LW and finally got it out.
I then cleaned it and filed the damage off.  It was reuseable so I was lucky.
This seems to be a part that is quite readily available in these parts at the
wreckers.  I'm sure you could find one or a whole set or someone near you could.

Good Luck
