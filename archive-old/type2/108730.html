Subject: RE: [T2] Pilot shaft wear

I think a little wear would be ok, since the shaft is usually stationary in
the bearing; they only rotate relative to each other when you actually have
the clutch depressed.

If pilot shaft has a few burrs, wear on the tip from a bearing
disinegrating:
I sanded it smooth with some crocus cloth...feels good don't think it will
bind, but will the wear (slightly smaller diameter) matter?
