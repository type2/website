Guys,

Still have this 78 bus for Sale and I found the brown block off plate where  
the radio goes.

As I said before everything mechanical works except for the motor. It was 
seized so I pulled it and sent it to fast German Auto to get rebuilt. It 
just arrived today. Although I am putting it in my 71.  I could put in a 
1600 T1 for anyone who is interested and then you could  swap it out later

The dash and interior are nice. No middle seat though. It is fully auto and 
has a functioning gas heater which should come in handy now that winter is 
near.

I posted pics of the few rusty spots - nothing that I consider major Check 
it out under my site at cyberbeetle_dot_com under My Cars

Need to make room in the garage for my vert
thanks
