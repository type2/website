Usually around 60-65 and the Mothership hits her groove.  The fastest I
have had her up to is an estimated 100 mph.  I was coming out of Atlanta on
I 20 East.  Just as you reach the perimeter (I-285) you begin a long slow
downhill.  

I had just gotten her a couple weeks before and was young, dumb, and full
of 97 octane, volkswagenly speaking of course.  I put the metal to the
pedal and didn't let up till the speed arm was pointing straight down to
the floorboard.  

Haven't done it since and don't see any reason to do it again.  

I have always said you drive your bus with your ass, at least I do.  You
sit and feel the vibration, you listen for that certain hum in the sound of
the engine (and it damn sure ain't &quot;PHWEEM&quot;).  You know that sound and
feeling that tells you you're at the right speed, or at least the right
rpm.  I can almost tell my exact speed just by the sound of my engine.  I
figure many of you can do the same thing.

Fast enough to meet the need, but not so fast you call it a rush.  Ain't it
great driving a bus?
