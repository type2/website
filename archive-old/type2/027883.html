&gt;these 'bug me' videos that show you pretty much everything from
start to finish on keeping your bug going, what I was wondering is if im in 
some series need on an engine schooling, would these prove to be helpful to 
me?

I won the #1 basic tune one as a campout doorprize._dot_can't get my SO to watch 
it..she swears you wants to learn to keep up the KG..but she's still at the 
pointing it out to me stage. There are several errors in even that basic 
video, but all in all, ok novice tape.

Bought #3 (Upright rebuild) from Rick Rawlins at a Tampa show. Didn't even 
own an upright then..now have several. Again, a few errors that even I can 
see..but I like it. Especially seeing a clean workspace, proper tools, etc 
:) They breakdown/buildup a 1600DP, a 1500SP, and a 40 horse. NO FI of 
course..but overall a good video IMO. Be better yet as a bootleg, vice the 
$33 or so :)
