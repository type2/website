Subject: greetings from alabama

Greetings to all im a new member of the list, ive been on the vintagebus
list all year, because i have been focused on my 66. But the time has come
to revive the super pickel, my 79 green westy.
I got it for $250 about 10 years ago, it had a new engine in it , but had
been driven 500 miles non stop to alabama from new york on the first day out
of the shop by some guys going to mardi gras. Needless to say the valves
were so tight it burned up one head. I replaced the head and did a top half
rebuild and put about 40,000 on it following the grateful dead of all
things, and parked it in 95 because it sprang an oil leak. I took the engine
out and i havent touched it since, i feel kinda ashamed, but you know how it
is with the big nasty 2L. Anyway i remember the good old days of blowin
vanagons off the highway, and cruisin 90mph, they were good days. Let me say
that 5 years of sitting really takes its toll on a bus, its the worst thing
you can do, especially in a coastal town like mobile, alabama.  So i joined
the list in hopes of being inspired to get it back together, i was about to
breakdown and start parting it out.  The first day on the list a front nose
skin for free was posted and im on the way!   Be sure to look me up if you
come down I-10.
