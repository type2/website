I've read in this group before that overfilling a VW engine can result in
REALLY bad things. I got my '73 bus, Mr. Tang, back from the shop yesterday.
As it is new I had them do a variety of things, among them change the oil.
Since I picked it up it has felt a little sluggish. I discovered this
morning that they overfilled my oil by about a quart.

What does the list think should be done at this point?

1. Drain off the extra oil before heading home tonight
2. Drain off the extra oil after I get home tonight
3. Don't bother draining off the extra oil at all

My drive home is over a mountain highway (No. Cal. Bay area's Hwy 17). It is
something of a workout for the bus.
