I want a bumper sticker (when I get bumpers:-) that says &quot;I Brake for
Tailgaters&quot;
in very legible, plain bold letters.  Does anybody have the resources to make
bumperstickers?  What would it cost to do that?

a friend of mine was sick of being tailgated on the windy mountain road he
lived on.  he put that very sticker on the back of his old ford pickup and
backed it into a stump a couple times..

voila -  no more tailgaters!!!  :)
