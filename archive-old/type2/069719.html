Subject: The Get 78 Westy Ready for Fla. Story

(For those who want the short &quot;innovation&quot; version, jump to #4, design for
3rd single adult bed!)
This is the tale of getting the aged (170K original everything but clutch
disk and heater box) Westy ready for a long haul to Fla. Keys....it's gone
20K since last yr's 1 trip around USA with just this nagging &quot;rattle&quot; after
dropping high revs.  (1) I redid via lowtech the ripped balljoint seals in
front- squeeze grease in via needle, wrap liberally with plastic tape and
duct tape; the idea is too keep water/grit out.  This doesn't work too well
with ripped CV seal, which slings the grease out.  So I bought a seal with
its attendant grease and bolts, and used the socket hex wrench to get off
the old one, with liberal use of spray gum cutter to clean things off.
    The CV's showed 170K wear (grooves, some pitting, and a pitted ball or
two- I dug out the group a dealer had tossed out when redoing a bus (they
don't clean them, just replace 'em!  Keep the outer ring with its inner
ring; they are matched.  The balls I check with a micr.; found one
oversized, and you could tell by its darkened look, since it takes the
brunt of more friction.  Flipped one cv over; lets the wear occur on  nice
NEW portion of rings when going forward.  Found it difficult to get more Mb
disulfide grease- doesn't anyone pack their own CV's any more?
    (2) Since our near miss of flattening the pool with the errant parking
brake, I swore to do the brake thing and proceeded to lift the bus via
ramps in rear, jack stands up front (with a stack of Nautilus weights under
bumper for insurance), and then pulled the rear drums using a floor jack
under the lower shock mount to support axle while pulling wheel-
Tire wouldn't clear fender, so I used two cinder blocks to support car from
rear and let down the axle.  Considering I NEVER did the rear brakes in my
memory, the drums came off (two little bolts hold them) with a little
tapping and wiggling; I coudn't  back off the shoes since adjustor was
frozen, as well as a parking brake cable.  The lining was almost to metal,
and the brake cylinders showed seepage, so it was off to FLAPS (Betty's
Auto- lots of Beck/Arnley stuff) for a cable, cylinders, and assorted other
stuff.  I forgot what fun this is, since you alternate CLEAN work with
dirty work!  My 10 yr old was very helpful in bleeding the brakes; after
her ride in the van almost into the pool, she NOW KNOWS where the brake
pedal is (she had lots of practise as I laid under car turning a bleeder
bolt and yelling &quot;PUMP!&quot;).  She also pumped as I adjusted the shoes and
parking brake to eveness.
     (3) Replaced the cracked fan belt, and then proceeded to compression
check after warming up the car- (QUESTION: why do the rear wheels spin when
car is in NEUTRAL????).....135 all around, #1 is 125 but as it cranks,
seems to drop below 120- related to lifter getting tight (as it pumps
up?-#1 is the slowest to pump up lifters- tomorrow will  check for valve
tightness, pull lifters, put in spare pair, and readjust.
     (4) Spent rest of day designing bigger bed for my now over 5 ft kid-
The old custom design was a 1/4&quot; board which fit on a 1&quot;squ. oak frame
which was suspended from nylon loops hanging on seatbelt upper bolts; front
of frame rested on dash top; with a custom fit foam pad it fit great with
pass. seat turned around.  The new design fits a 28&quot; x70&quot; foam pad which
starts at left edge of sink cabinet and extends to two posts dropped in
front next to steering wheel and passenger seat turned SIDEWAYS to let
board pass by.  You can even drive it like this. Daughter LOVES it-one edge
is next to sink which can still be opened; other edge has just enough room
to open sliding door and get out, and rear bed can be made or returned to a
seat; important to us, for she sleeps longer!   If we stop in a rest area,
it is perfect; if in a campground, we hook on the tent and put the
board/mattress out there with folding picnic table.
   The frame for the board has beams extending from the lip on each side of
sink top, and a post at left with a nail sticking from beam bottom into
hole in floor and a nail extending thru beam into post at top.  Midpost at
right is a piece bolted to the trangle supporting pass. door post and left
there. Nail &quot;Pegs&quot; are used to hold it all together under the 3/8&quot; ply,
which is stored on top above the mattress on the folded out bed.  The frame
is six 1x1&quot; pieces  which fit perfectly in that slot above the cloths
closet.   All in all a busy day......Mike Benthin in NJ
