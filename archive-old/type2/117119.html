Subject: Re: [T2] How did you restore your front kick panels?

what i was going to do was use some door skins from home depot, they are 7
$ and are of the right thickness.  i was just going to stain them to match
my walls and door panels as i am going for an all wood interior for kind of
a surf look on top of being cheap they look very nice when down right.  i
figured i'd poly coat them after i was done to prevent scuffs.  you could
cover these with fur and be set and have enough left over for projects,
etc.

I want to put the front kick panels back in my 76 Westy; however, they are
in
sad shape. I am going to use the old ones as a template, but I'm unsure of
what material I should use as the &quot;board&quot;?The original is that hard
cardboard
stuff. I can't find anything like that. What about thin plywood like luan
(sp)?
I have some black vinyl too, but I'm not sure what kind of adhesive to use.
I
have some 3M spray that I think will work well- anything better? I seem to
remember doing my Triumph Spitfire's with hot glue. I think you could see
the
glue line though- too long -that was 10 yrs ago.

Pictures would be cool too. Suggestions don't have to be for stock
restoration
- I thought about putting black fur on them and around the seats- with the
little dingleberries around the windows.

Thanks for any tips,
