&gt; Just curious.  Is there a big difference between names brands of shocks?
&gt; Bilstein and KYB claim to improve the handling and wind veering of the bus,
&gt; but I'd like to hear some more about it from people that know.

This I gotta see.

You get wind veering in a campmobile (whatever kind you have) because you're
driving a sail. You could have the greatest suspension in the world, and
that's not going to change the fact that you also have around 100 square
feet of area on each side of the Bus.

Handling's a different story, and good shocks will help there. It would help
more if you used a bigger swaybar (or a swaybar at all in the back, if such
there be) but good shocks will help.
