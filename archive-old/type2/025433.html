I am going to report that nothing went wrong.  So often I read of all the
trouble that people have. I think that I have only posted problems that I
have had, I get a little gun shy at time, expecting everything that happens
to everybody to happen to me.

I thought that I would post that this past weekend, I drove from Richmond VA
to Roanoke VA, to Corbin KY, to Harlan KY, Roanoke,  VA, and back to
Richmond VA and had no troubles.  Even climbing up Afton mountain and
bridging Pennington Gap, while creeping along very slowly, our beloved
Bussie did just fine.   She is a 1972 7 seater, blue and white, all
original, original Solex carbs, original 1700 CC engine.  69K miles now.  No
sign of overheating at any point.  Handled well up to 75 MPH (that was as
fast as I went).  Was well behaved during the torrential downpours that
plagued this region this past weekend.  I can't wait to take another trip.
This was our first long trip since our March acquisition.
