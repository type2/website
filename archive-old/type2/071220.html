Updates my 72 Westy 1700 twin webers, in case anybody cares....
On my way home from school today the Ghetto Cruiser died, whatever the problem
is, it won't even let the engine start anymore, no gas is getting in there,
its the side of the road now, hopefully I can get  it towed.  A friend on mine
stopped as I was standing by it on the side of the road and said &quot;Boy, isn't
this a classic site, volkswagen broke down on the side of the road&quot; its funny
cause its true.  Feel free to send me lots of money so I can try and figure
out what the hell is wrong with it.
