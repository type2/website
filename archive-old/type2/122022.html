&gt; I have a 72 bus with rear tires size LT195/75R14

&gt; I've tried a few FLAPS and tire stores in SF, nobody seems to have 
&gt; this size.
&gt;
&gt; I've leaving for Tahoe tomorrow and would like to pick some chains up 
&gt; along the way.  Does anyone have a suggestion of where to buy them?

If you're heading out on 80, there's a Firestone tire center on 
University in Berkeley (at Milvia, right after MLK).  Call them (510 
843 5454) and ask if they have chains for your tire size.  They seemed 
to have a large stock of chains when I was in there not long ago.

&gt; Also, is LT195/75R14 the correct rear tire size for a 72?  If not, 
&gt; what is?

Correct size for a '76 is 185R14.  I'm almost positive that's correct 
for a '72, as well (all Bus years?)  That same Firestone shop has a 
pretty good price on the correct size / load rating / load index 
(185R14 C 99P) tire for a Bus (including campers), $50/tire (Capitol 
Radial SV-820).
