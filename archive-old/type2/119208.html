You can use it if the coil impedence is within spec. If it's too low, you
will burn out your compufire/pertronix/points.

the use of this will NOT cause the engine temps to change.

A good CDI will definately wake up the ignition on the car. Many ignition
systems are weak and the owners do not know it. We had a customer here that
was blowing out 2000PPM HCs at idle. The addition of a CDI brought it down
to almost nothing. I will admit that there was likely something in the
ignition system at fault, but this owner decided to get with 2003 instead of
tinkering with 1940s ignition &quot;technology&quot;.
