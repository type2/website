According to my 77 owners manual, 75 is the top speed listed. My Westy
cruises at 80-85 all day long. AND the speedo is dead-on accurate to the
mile. I had it calibrated and radar tested for accuracy.



&gt; Some comments made in another thread about limiting the top end speed
&gt; make me wonder what's really safe for my '76 Westfalia. Mine is the 2L
&gt; fuel injected type 4 engine. It's a recent rebuild by yours truly, an
&gt; experience I don't soon wish to repeat.
&gt;
&gt; I've owned earlier busses ('63 &amp; '67) which I would (could) never take
&gt; above 60 mph. This bus with the type 4 seems quite happy cruising at
&gt; 65-75 mph. What is the recommended top speed? I do not have a tach.


&gt; I appreciate everyone's input. I don't want my Westfalia to become a
&gt; &quot;Westfailure&quot;.

Kyle enjoys his stretch  67 with a Chevy V8, called &quot;Westfailure&quot; :)
