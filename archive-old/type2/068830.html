&gt;I've had a number of you ask me about my powder coating that I have been 
&gt;having done on my engine tin, rims, etc.  I called up Jim Kruse (the guy 
&gt;that does the work) and he was thrilled to hear that I was posting my 
&gt;stories about his work on Internet.  I thought that just in case any of 
&gt;you were wanting to contact him to have some stuff done (he's pretty 
&gt;cheap based on what I hear from several of you members) I'd post his stats:
&gt; 
&gt;Kruse's Custom Powder Coating
&gt;205 Livingston Street
&gt;Box 69
&gt;Filley, NE 68357
&gt;402-662-3060

Just for a frame of reference, what did he charge you for the engine tin?
How much for the rims and what kind of condition were they in when you gave
them to him?
