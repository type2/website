&lt;&lt; Just one thing I would like to add when you mount speakers in the door,
depending on the type of music you listen to and how loud you play it,
your mirrors will vibrate and it becomes very difficult to see anything
in them.
 &gt;&gt;

Try:

For composition cups that fit behind the speakers and also act as a box
for the speaker. Only the cone should move if the speaker frame is so-
lidly mounted to the door frame...
