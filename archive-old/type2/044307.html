Subject: [T2] Throttle switch

A few people had suggested checking the full throttle enrichment switch in
regards to the bucking question. 77 and 78 do not have them.
76 and 79 Calif does.
In the 68-79 Bentley wiring diagrams for some reason they lump 73 to 75
together. 75 USA has FI....
They show the 76 diagram as 'from August 1975 [1976 models] but it is wrong.
It shows a 7 pin AFM. Up to 12/75 was a 6 pin. 1/76 started 7 pin......
It is switch F25 and is connected to pins 3 and 18 of the ECU.
