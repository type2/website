Subject: Commercial Paint Stipping

Called a company down in Memphis that advertises in Hemming's: Redi Strip
(601-342-2519). Their process is to dip the car into an 8x8x20 vat of
non-acidic agent with a 24-volt charge going through it...Somehow this
removes all of the paint and rust from the car. It takes at least 32 hours
and sometimes more, depending on the amount of rust.

Bottom line $$$-wise is that if I deliver a 67 bus stripped of all non-body
and all metal components, it'll cost between $850-$1000. The more rust it
has, the more difficult (time-consuming) it is to get the paint off.

Apparently he stripped a 23-window last week and it wound up costing $900
for that.

Thought you all would be interested. I figure this would be worthwhile for a
very rare bus, but for $1000 I can buy the mig welder I want, a nicer
sandblasting kit, and a whole bunch of wire and sand. 8) Joe
