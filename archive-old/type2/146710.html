Subject: RE: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

&gt;&gt; What does the hot manifold mean or maybe the cool manifold mean? 

Also check to make sure the fuel line going across to carb #2 is not kinked or obstructed--BTDT, I had a valve seize in a guide after 5 miles--the fuel-starved side had just enough to burn real lean and hot.

I concur with all Chris said about ensuring no manifold leaks (use the THICK gaskets) using a synchrometer, checking plugs for firing, verifying chokes, etc.  Dual carbs are great once you get the procedure down pat, synchronizing the linkage first before starting, etc.
