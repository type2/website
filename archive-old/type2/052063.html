&gt;Hi Aaron and list,
&gt;
&gt;I can read german and the text entstörsatz means radio noise filter or
&gt;screen
&gt;Zum störer means to the noise emitter
&gt;0.47µf/100v means  0.47 microfarad per 100 volts.

These are typically items that are connected to the voltage regulator or
coil to stop interferance of a radio signal by the pulses created by the
ignition and/or other electrical waves going on.
