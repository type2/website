Subject: Bearing Grease

I recently replaced the front wheel bearings and grease seals on my '79
westy and packed the hubs with a high temperature wheel bearing grease from
my local FLAPS.  This grease seems to flow out from under the hubcaps when
I drive and makes a mess underneath the hubcaps and eventually on the rims
outside of the hubcaps.  What's up with that?

Does anyone know of a good wheel bearing grease that resists flow due to
the combined effects of heat and centrifugal force?
