...as well, Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas is the first national park,
really, in the world, something like 20 years older than Yosemite, and
25 older than Yellowstone.  Of course, Yellowstone was the first park to
use the *name* &quot;National Park&quot; -- neither Hot Springs nor Yosemite used
the wording until later.

Hot Springs was controversial from the beginning as a &quot;National Park&quot;, but
is one of the seminal place for the system, quite, quite historic.
