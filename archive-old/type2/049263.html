Subject: [T2] VW based military vehicle

Last weekend I travelled about 2 and half hours to see a very unique
military machine that was developed in the 50's.  Fletcher aviation out of
S. Cal was hoping to market this to the military.  The body is aluminum,
very well designed and constructed.  This was fully amphibious and could
carry 6 people or loads of cargo.  Fletcher even designed his own air
cooled engine that would put out a whopping 2300cc in the 50's!!!  The
engine pictured in the vehicle was not original, but a newer 1600 that
bolted right up.

The owners of this vehicle would like to have the tranny repaired, I guess
it leaks.  Who could I send them to that could repair this tranny?  I
thought it might be a barn door tranny, but Thom things it may be a Kubel
or an early Porsche.  Either could be correct, Fletcher was friends with
Dr. Porsche and had a couple of Kubels when he was developing this car.

Thanks for your help.

Sorry about the quality of the photo's, the vehicle was in a storage barn
with poor light.
