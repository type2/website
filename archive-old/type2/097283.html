Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start update

&gt; There was a
&gt; spark, so I was clearly getting current... but the starter
&gt; did not engage.
&gt;
&gt; Time for a new Starter?

Bridging the 2 large posts should get the starter to spin. The starter will
never engage the flywheel unless you energize the solenoid. The solenoid moves
the starter drive out to the ring gear before it runs the starter motor.
Jump from the battery post on the solenoid to the top right push-on terminal.
1) Do you just get a small spark?
If yes, solenoid is bad.
2) Do you get a large clunk and the starter does not spin?
If yes, either the solenoid or the starter is bad.
To test if it is the solenoid, get a voltmeter and see if you have 12v at the
lower large post [the one with the braided wire]. If you have 12v, the starter
is bad.
Now bridge the 2 large posts:
If the starter spins when you jump the 2 large posts, it may be good.
If the starter does not spin when you jump the 2 posts, it is bad.
