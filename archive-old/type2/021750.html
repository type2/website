Subject: Rust

Let's consider this: 
assuming I have rust, albeit minimal and largely cosmetic (slight wheel well 
edge, back left where a collision occurred, floor below the driver and 
passenger seats, scattered etceteras) (which I do), and assuming I do not care 
for it, and care for it to eat my bus to death (which I don't) how might one 
prevent further corrosion, say stop the rust where it is until the budget can 
handle a complete overall, full body work and paint? Mind you, the Southwest 
is very dry, but this bus (71) did manage to get a speck here and there 
(largest area 10 x 10 inches), despite being in New Mexico since 1971.
