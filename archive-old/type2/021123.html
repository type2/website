&gt; Thats it very short . What does NOS mean?

Stan:
New Old Stock  in our case would probably (hopefully) be in Volkswagen boxes
with cosmoline on parts that might be prone to rusting.
As opposed to NORS, the R standing for Replacement. These could be anything.
Best case would be OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) like Glyco engine
bearings, Bilstein engine parts, Kolbenscmidt engine parts, Goetze engine
parts, Elring engine gaskets, FAG ball and roller bearings, ATE brake parts,
Teves or TRW-Teves engine parts.
Sometimes NORS are inferior brands.
Hope that helped.
