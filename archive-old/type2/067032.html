Subject: Cost of creating a VW list CD

I know that the VW list CD may not go anywhere, but I thought it would be 
interesting to throw out some numbers on CD production for the benefit of 
the list members. This is one of the low cost quotes that we received 
lately. Pressing cost includes two color art work provided by client, 
price goes down obviously as the qty. goes up:

Qty. 500
- ---------
Initial up front cost        $650.00
CD Pressing (_at_ $0.65 each)   $325.00
jewel cases (_at_ $0.30 each)   $150.00
                             -------
                   Total    $1125.00
               Cost each CD    $2.25



Not a bad price, but someone would obviously have to incur these costs up 
front.

I gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at 
which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed. Suddenly, I imagine they 
appear beside me. I tell Socrates about the national debate over one's 
right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human condition. I tell 
Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia, and 
I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we have 
found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic table. 
I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with wonder. We 
spend the rest of the night lighting farts.
