David, even as early as '68, lights are pretty interwoven into the electrical system--that is, a problem on one end of the system may impact a seemingly unrelated part of the system. I suspect your problem may well be caused by the faulty headlight relay. I would recommend not tearing into the dash until you have a chance to check that. 

If the new relay doesn't solve your problem, I'd look first at the emergency light switch. Much of the lighting &quot;logic&quot; was moved there after 1967.

Thanks! Joe
