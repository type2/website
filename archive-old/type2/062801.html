Subject: Re: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat?

&gt;Hello,
&gt;       I would like to submit a question to the all knowing and all-powerful
&gt;list. I have a 1965 21 Window Deluxe Microbus (non-walkthru) which needs
&gt;both a middle and rear seat. I would like to know if a non-walkthru
&gt;deluxe ever originally came with the smaller 2/3 seat (that I've seen in
&gt;walk-thrus) or ONLY with the full seat with the pivoting back-rest near
&gt;the doors. All the old ads I've seen show the nine seat arrangement.
&gt;       I just bought the 2/3 middle seat from Dan Kinsey (That VWguy). In the
&gt;meantime I am happy to have a seat which fits there.  But if this is not
&gt;&quot;correct&quot; I would like to eventually trade the smaller seat for the full

Non-walkthroughs (24s) were all nine seaters.  What 'officially' distinguished
25s (walk-throughs) from 24s were not the fact they were 'walkthrough' but
the fact they were 7 seaters......

What I'm trying to say in a most convoluted manner is that non-walkthroughs
were all (originally) 9 seaters  and all walk-throughs were 7 seaters....
