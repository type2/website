Subject: Corvair engine &amp; trans kit for Bus 4-sale!

Anyone wanna buy a 140 hp corvair engine with 4spd trans and all the 
conversion goodies for a bus?
The trans is excellent but the engine needs work.  Sounds like it is about to 
lose a valve seat.
I am in Tampa, Florida.  If you are interested please e-mail me.

Dave
