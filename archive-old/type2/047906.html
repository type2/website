Find a COSTCO warehouse store.

Give them $150.00 for one of their excellent vehicle shelters.

Erect the shelter in your parking space, staking it down if you prefer.

Insert bus.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The cover i buy needs to be able to resist sunlight, cold, rain, and
snow. it would be nice if i could lock it in place, too - just to prevent
theft.

any suggestions? favorites? things i should avoid?  &lt;&lt;
