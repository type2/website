&lt;&lt;Hello All,

I am converting my 81 vanagon from fuel injection to dual weber34s.
We have the fuel injection removed and are at the point to start 
installing the manifolds.  The instructions are extremely vague.  
There is a threaded hole on both manifolds just under where the carbs 
mount onto the manifolds and we do not know what needs to be connected 
there.  The instructions say nothing about it at all.  Has anyone out 
there performed this conversion and can give me some advice as to what 
to do?  Also, does the hoses from the charcoal filter need to be 
reconnected to anything?  The instructions leave many questions 
un-answered.  Any help would be great.&gt;&gt;

I installed these on my '74 Westy, but it originally had dual carbs, so fuel 
injection replacement is likely different.

The threaded holes in the base of your manifold are for hooking up your 
vacuum brake hoses.  You can also connect the retard side from your dual 
vacuum advance dizzy (if you have one).

I don't have the charcoal canister hooked up.  The engine ventilation hose 
which would have connected to the air filter on the original setup, is now 
stuck under the engine tin at the seal to vent under the engine.  

You may have trouble getting the linkage set up.  If you bought these at your 
FLAPS, go back to them for help.  If you bought them from Performance Parts 
Warehouse, they have one guy who works there that knows VWs, but he is hard 
to get a hold of.
