Subject: RE: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
   these tires.

&gt; compiling VW's tire specifications for the different years (I promise, it'll
&gt; be short!). P-mail me off list.
&gt; Please include the year and all the information from the WEIGHTS section of
&gt; the TECHNICAL DATA chapter in the owners manual, Unladen Weight through
&gt; Gross Axle Weight Rear for each model. English units are fine; no need to
&gt; include the metrics.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; isn't all of this info in the Bentley manual?

I think it might be compiled better in the Without Guesswork.
There used to be several of them online at the Obsolete Doc Project page.
