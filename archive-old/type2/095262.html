Subject: 78 engine/tranny swap into a 72



I've been looking through the archives and bently and cannot find enough 
information about it.  Does anyone know if a the whole tranny and engine 
from a 78 will fit in a 72?  Or do I have to change over the bellhousing and 
use the 72 tranny?


Thanks,
Mike
