Does anyone know how the fuel injection system works for sure? I understand that all fire at the same time, but should I have 12v on both leads when I turn the key to the on position? And should both leads strobe when I try to start?
 The problem I'm having is when I start the 78 Type 2 It will fire immediately then die. So I think the cold start valve is working. But the injectors themselves don't seem to .. any help?
