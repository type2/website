Subject: FS: 79 bus-$800-Illinois

Bussers:

Local bus owner looking to sell.  It's getting cold:

'79 bus, no middle seat, needs alternator but runs.
$800 or offer.  Jim Allen (815) 756-5345.

This is in DeKalb, Illinois (between Chicago and Rockford).
I have never seen the bus running, just sitting by the
road.  I left my card saying &quot;call if you need help.&quot;
I know little else except I don't need another VW right
now.
