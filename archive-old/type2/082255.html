Subject: Re: [T2] Been thinking of moving myself

During my 20 years of active duty military, 4 USMC and 16 Army, I was 
stationed and had temporary duty in a lot of places in the U.S. and abroad 
including Camp Lejeune, NC and Fort Jackson, SC and when I retired I chose 
the state you are in, Minnesota.  At least we don't have to worry about 
hurricanes!  I was through two of those in SC.  BTW, I'm originally from 
Indiana.

&gt;  Minnesota, the buses are rusty and the weather's lousy!
