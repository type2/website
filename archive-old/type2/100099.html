&gt; 1. Adjust Hydraulic Lifters
&gt; 
&gt; Followed Bentley procedures, heard a lot of springs popping after tightening
&gt; the rockers again, and some of the valves seems to have more thread left on
&gt; the adjustment than others.

I had the same problem.  What I discovered was that the push rod wasn't
lined up in the cup of the rocker arm properly before I started to tighten
the screw.  Once I did that before I started the tightening process the
exposed thread &quot;count&quot; was even.  It was my first time doing an adjustment
but it didn't seem right to me because I had inspected each lifter and found
them all to be good.

&gt; Also, valve noise doesn't seem noticably reduced
&gt; as I expected.

I would do it over again.

I adjusted my hydraulic lifters when I replaced all of the valve adjustment
screws.  Prior to doing this I had a little abnormal valve noise and it
seems louder on one side than the other.

I counted the turns while I undid each old screws and there were all over
the place.

I followed the list advice of 1.5 turns and so far so good.  Some of the
noise came back recently but it only reminded me that it was time for an oil
change and now it's quiet again.

&gt; 2. New v.c. gaskets
&gt; 
&gt; Still leaking oil after new gaskets on the 3/4 side. Too much heat from the
&gt; catalytic warping my covers?

I had an oil leak problem with my covers along with the push rod tube seals.
I found a nice pair of used valve covers (nice meaning still painted black
and no rust) and a better pair of bails.  Both were badly rusted.

New gaskets, I used wheel bearing grease like Sean Bartnik suggested in his
push rod tube tech article but before I put them only I cleaned the head
surface and the inside sealing surface of the valve cover gasket with &quot;00&quot;
steel wool.  Then I used another list suggestion and greased where the bails
ride so they slid on easily.
