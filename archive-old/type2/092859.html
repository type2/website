Subject: the Little Brakes that wouldn't

8o|

I've got a real head-banger of a brake situation.

I'm STILL working on getting this bus on the road.......................
Six years ago, I replaced everything in the brake system, with the
exception of the metal lines.  I don't remember whether I got a firm
pedal at that time, or not.  Last month I got back around to working
on the brakes.  I changed the brake fluid, per Bentley, and had no
noticeable leaks, yet could not get a firm pedal--just pumping and
pumping............

Thinking I must have installed a faulty master cylinder, I replaced it,
and adjusted the pushrod clearance to spec.  After bleeding, the
problem persists.  Repeated pumping builds up a little firmness of
pedal about an inch before the bottom of the stroke, which disappears
as soon as the pedal is released.  I'm positive the refill reservoir is
remaining full at all times during the bleeding, and the bled fluid is
free of bubbles.  There are no noticeable leaks, though I haven't
removed any of the brake drums.  The E-brake is on.

I've also not bench bled the MC, though I've not had to do this with bug
MCs in the past.

Suggestions?

...........be on the road in no time.               clouds of 
delusion.   R. Hunter
