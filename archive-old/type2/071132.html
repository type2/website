Subject: CV Circlip Help Needed
Message-ID: &lt;c0cded2e.2528fab1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I've put myself in a big hole this time...

Yesterday I pulled off the drivers side axle to replace both cv boot

Actually, I can get the circlips on the axle, but when I push the joint back 
and forth on the axle, the circlip flies off.  This leads me to believe the 
circlip is useless and will not hold the joint to the axle while on the car.  
Am I right?

Last time, I did not &quot;test&quot; the circlips strength.  I guess the bottom line 
is these circlips need to be on the axle and must stay put, right?

TIA,
Paul
