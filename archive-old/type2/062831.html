Subject: Re: Advice needed for a 78' bus (fwd)

Thanks for the advice, my only problem is that all the junkyards I have 
called in the Tidewater area do not have any junked buses I can pull the 
heater channel off of. Any suggestions on where I could get a cheap assembly
Yours in grease,

&gt; No sense breaking down in the cold.

&gt; &gt;I just bought a 78 bus for $400. It has a progressive dual carb rather 
&gt; &gt;than fuel injection so at least one thing is in my favor.
&gt; &gt; The transmission is stuck in second and 
&gt; 
&gt; Check the linkage. With any luck, something's come loose and jammed up and
&gt; you'll replace a screw and be on your way hollering &quot;Yippee!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;the muffler assemble is in the back seat. There is some heavy rust on 
&gt; &gt;the corner front wheel well and holes on the steps.  But in general the 
&gt; &gt;body is whole. The help I need is trying to figure out where to start. 
&gt; &gt;Take out the rust on the edges or get the damn thing running. The engine 
&gt; &gt;does run but the CV are currently in the back seat. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know how to check the CVs? They should be tight and move through
&gt; their full orbit. Make sure they're good! Clean and repack them. Make sure
&gt; there's NO dirt or sand in them. My guess it they're out as part of the
&gt; intended repair for the tranny, which probably minimizes the chance that
&gt; it's just linkage. Still, for $400 in the bus, you can afford to replace the
&gt; tranny if you have to.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yes the heater 
&gt; &gt;pipes are missing under the body. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you get these at a junkyard, be sure there are no leaks. The leaks cause
&gt; CO to get in the cab, killing you or causing brain damage...okay, you'd bail
&gt; out before it killed you, but if you're like me, you need all your brain cells.
