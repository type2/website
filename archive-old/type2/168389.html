Subject: valve adjustment on 78 Transporter

I have a friend with a sweet manx 1600 stroker 200 +HP that he built
himself, he took me for a cruise in the manx (aka 73 Beetle)
and i let him drive the stock 2.0L 78 transporter with old school F.I. ...he
tells me i need to adjust the valves, i say , i dont need to cus theyre
hydraulic, but i also think , they may have never been adjusted, since we've
always been told we dont need to ...so Question is, when is it a good time
to do an adjustment?    Joe...
