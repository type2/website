I answered my 3-hour-ago question.  I think.  I put the circlips on(snap ring 
pliers were NO help) and walked out to install on the bus.  Tightened 
everything up and took a long test drive.  No problems.  I made every 
possible motion to test the installation and no complaints from the joints.  

A few notes that may help some people.  To get the old circlips off, what I 
did was stick a pocket knife under one edge, and pried upward.  This gave 
room for a flat head to fit under, and then leverage to pry off.

The new boots, bought from RMMW 3 or so years ago and stored until now, were 
different from the old ones.  The metal part of the boot had ridges on it, 
that would NOT allow the cv bolt washer(square 2 hole port thingy) to sit 
flush with the boot.  Obviously I left those washers off, again I rechecked 
torque after 10 minute drive and all were good.

Apparently snap ring pliers DO work for this job, just not for me.  I drove 
all over today to find the best value for them and it turns out they were 
useless.  

Lastly, people recommend torqueing CV's at another 500 miles.  Last time I 
did this I actually checked them at 50 miles, and found them to be slightly 
loose.  YMMV.
