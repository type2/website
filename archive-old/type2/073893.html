Subject: 1967 bus for sale in North Carolina

Hi,

The bus is a 1967 deluxe that lost its trim about 20 years ago. It is 
a 7 passenger walkthru and has all of the seats and interior panels. 
Currently the bus is being pushed around by a 1969 single port motor 
with about 35,000 since it was last rebuilt. The bus can be sold with 
or without the motor. I have put a lot of pictures and a more 
detailed description of the bus on my web page. Please visit it and 
if you have any questions or interest in the bus send me an email.
