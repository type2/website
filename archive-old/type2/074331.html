&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi can any body tell me where the reverse light switch is on my 76 auto 
&gt; bus. 
&gt; I guess most of you would call it a backup light. It looks in my Bentley 
&gt; manual that this circuit is fused separately can any one say where this 
&gt; fuse 
&gt; should be? Thanks and a happy new year!. &gt;&gt;
