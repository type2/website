Subject: Re: [T2] Who did my conversion?

Wow, thank you for the really helpful input! I had not know that there 
are bits and pieces of this van that make it a more valued buy! I 
bought it on impulse and am kicking myself over the repairs thus far. I 
know I can't get my money back out of it, but I just wish it weren't 
costing me a fortune to get it rolling!

&gt; Mine is over 8ft tall... more like 8ft 4&quot;.  I built a garage with 10' 
&gt; ceilings and 9' doors just so my Safare could drive inside.  It's the 
&gt; first time in 15 years of ownership that it has been inside a garage.

So, do you think mine could be over 8'? I don't have it here, so I 
can't measure it. What makes yours over 8'? Do you have a roof rack or 
is it just the same as mine?

&gt; Your first picture of the exterior gives away the fact that it is a 
&gt; Safare.  This because of the wastewater tank that is visible hanging 
&gt; down on the drivers side (it has blue overspray on it).

Should that tank be up higher? Are there mounts that have let it slip?

&gt; Those tanks are very rare and of the dozen or so Safares I have laid 
&gt; eyes on over the years I have only seen one with this tank intact.

I am now imagining the things that were washed dow it that will need to 
be washed out. I think I'll dump a gallon or two of Clorox or Vinegar 
into it to kill the smell before I tackle cleaning it!

&gt; And I have seen zero of the hot water buckets - only seen that one in 
&gt; the manual.

Ok, so I now know I have a very expensive water bucket! ;-) Sure hope 
the PO took good care of the insides of it.

&gt; Picture #2 - looks like someone replaced, or perhaps repainted all the 
&gt; paneling!

Looks like crap in person. I figured the &quot;contact-paper&quot; paneling needs 
to go. Would like to replace with hard wood, not laminate.

&gt; And did some wierd things with the cushions and table also.

You think so? I will need to see your Bluto's interior to see what 
&quot;normal&quot; looks like. ;-)

&gt; I see the original table bracket is still on the &quot;seatback&quot;, in the 
&gt; middle.

Another mystery solved.

&gt; Picture #4 - your headliner and visors are CLEAN!

Yes, white, pristine, like new, etc. Sure hope they stay that way. The 
roof lid venty-door-thing was open when I was visiting it, so I asked 
them to close it for me as I can't get there from here.

&gt; Picture #5 - that thing between the front seats - I don't think it is 
&gt; from Safare.  Generic plywood and lack of any mention of it in the 
&gt; manual lead me to this conclusion.

I thought it was tacky, but wondered.... thanks!

&gt; Picture #6 - the fridge/sink unit is classic Safare.  A very nice bus, 
&gt; not unlike my own if I don't say so myself.  :)

Thanks, I look forward to the day I can drive and meet the folks on the 
list in my little blue whale.
