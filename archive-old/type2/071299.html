Hello all!!
	I am looking for an engine and some knowlege of my engine for my '79 T2.  I
would like an engine to rebuild and eventually install.  I want to learn about
the internals of the engine, and the best way to do that for me is to do a
rebuild.  My father says it would be advisable to uses a &quot;big bore&quot; kit.   Is
that advisable??  
	Anyways, if you have a lead on a buildable engine, lemmee know.

Drew, 
Sacramento.
