Subject: Re: [T2] Stock FI to progressive carb, any thoughts or 
  comments?

&gt; Gregory,
&gt;
&gt; You will get many opinions on this....mine is to fix the Fi, I think you
&gt; will have far fewere idling problems with it than the center mount that
&gt; you can't get warm in cold weather.....leads to carb icing...
&gt;
  With all due respect, I have run the Weber center-mounted carb on my
1.8ltr for 45,000 miles without ANY icing, or any other problem for that
matter. And this is a daily driver; rain, shine, snow, sleet, cold, or hot.

I get a solid 15 mpg city and 18 - 20 mpg highway. I've driven 2000 mile
vacation trips and 20 mile commutes with only regular maintenance.

Maybe I'm just lucky.

Regards,
Dave
