As anyone who has ever put a timing light on their bus can plainly 
see.  Stock distributors from 72-75 timed to spec are similar.  People have 
for years been telling me there was something wrong with my engine when I 
tell them that the timing advances off the scale (scale reads to 40 
BTDC).  All I can assume is that these people who get excited about this 
much advance have not ever actually looked at their own engines.  Thanks 
for the clear, factual post, John.
