Subject: Thanks

I am overdue to send a note of thanks to this list. Some of you may remember 
the dilemma I found myself in a few weeks ago. A friend had given me a 
Safare with an incomplete Porsche engine install. Another friend was in an 
accident and totalled her 66 daily driver. I tried to show her that there 
were other options, and that if she liked split window buses, there were 
others available in the nearby areas in her price range. Yet she selected 
this 74 Safare.

I promised it to her as quickly as I could put it together. I was told by 
the PO that he bought the motor from a Vacaville area Porsche shop who told 
him it was a good pull from a customer who just wanted a bigger engine for 
his Porsche. He had not finished installing the carbs and exhaust, the 
distributor drive shaft was missing, and when I got that, the distributor he 
gave me with it would not advance. He paid $150 for stock dual Solex carbs, 
so I thought they would be good.

 I feel deeply indebted to the Type 2 list. Though I don't remember the 
names of all those who contributed to help me get this together, several 
responses from several list members all dovetailed together and made the 
project come together. When the carbs weren't performing, one list member 
reminded me of the dump tube problem on stock Solex, and I remembered I had 
another pair of these carbs stashed away that the local VW shop fixed the 
dump tube for me. Another member told me how to try to unstop a clogged carb 
by revving it up and capping the intake which led me to discover that side 
of the motor wasn't performing and had a hole in the head. Others jumped in 
and helped me with questions on finding the correct head. Others helped me 
figure out the distributor issues. Then with all installed and running, the 
motor developed a knock and needed replacement. Suggestions from the list 
helped me change this motor in record time.

The method I ended up using was two small floor jacks and two 4 x 8 wood 
blocks. First one side of the engine was lifted to rest on the 4&quot; side of 
the block, then the other side the same. Then it was lifted to rotate the 
block to the 8&quot; side, and then the other side the same. Then it was high 
enough to slide the floor jack under with a 1 x 4 for stability, one jack 
each side, lifting slowly and equally on each side, jacking the tail of the 
bus in the air a little bit to clear and the mounting studs lined up almost 
perfectly with the bell housing on the first try! Then the motor slid on 
perfectly. What a pleasure to install a motor this way! It was the first 
time I was ever able to get a motor to go on without a lot of shaking and 
shoving to get it to go.

I truly want to thank everyone on this list for their contributions to the 
success of this project. I was able to deliver the bus, (even if 4 weeks 
late! I have one PATIENT friend!) and now my friend is just waiting to take 
it into the shop to have  things dialed in and checked out that I wasn't 
sure of. She is happy, and I am grateful to all here for your help.

Thanks again,

John
