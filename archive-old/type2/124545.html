Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring for Bus Tachometer

Bryan asked:
 
 I am trying to figure out the connections for a VDO tachometer.  I have been 
 browsing internet resources, and have mixed information.
 
 The terminals look like:
[+12][+6][1][-]
 
 Does anyone know which goes to what on a 12V system (the +12 is self 
 explanotory).
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

All those terminals appear to be self-explanatory.....

+12  is 12V

+6   is  6V

1 is the distributor side of the coil [look on top of a Bosch coil: 15 is positive, 1 is negative]

- is  ground
