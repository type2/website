Subject: [T2] steering box and intake manifold problems

I am looking for a new or remanufactured steering box for my 70 bus.  Any
tips about where or what to buy would be appreciated.  I am also having a
problem with an exhaust leak at the connection between the manifold and
the exhaust.  I have changed the gaskets but it doesn't seem to seal
well.  Help what should I do.

Mahalo
