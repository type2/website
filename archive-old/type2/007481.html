Hi,
      The first thing I'd try would be another VW key. The locks on a baywindow arn't very sophisticated and after twenty odd years of (ab)use are probably pretty unreliable. It's quite likely that you can open at least one of the doors on your bus with any given key that fits the slot. Unless, of course, someone's fixed them up recently.

Cheers,
             W.
