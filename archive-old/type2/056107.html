&gt;BLUE, GOLD, and BLACK Bosch ignition coil.

&gt;I'm still searching the archives for the color difference

You'll come across a Hoover sermon (well, at least a kvetch) to the effect
that there is no electrical/performance difference between the blue and
black coils. The blue coils have slightly more insulation and a much higher
markup.

I think he notes that you can get all the black coils you can carry for 50c
each at a junkyard.

I never heard of a gold coil but I don't get to town much.
