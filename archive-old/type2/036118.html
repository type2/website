Subject: [VB] AIRS site UPDATE (non screwed up resend)

After changing ISP's and rebuilding my system, everything on AIRS is
currently back up to date. My apologies to those who had to wait, and my
sincere thanks to the sys admins that helped me with some problems.
(especially you dave)
  IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR NAME ON THE SITE, even though you signed up, it has
been lost. Please signup again, although I'm pretty sure I got all the 40 +
apps posted up that were waiting in my mailbox. Please make sure you have
refreshed, or cleared your browsers cache before sending in 20 forms asking
why you don't see your name on the list :)
  AIRS is currently up to 360 members with more comin in everyday. We
currently have ppl signed up in every state in the U.S. EXCEPT for DELAWARE,
MISSISSIPPI, NORTH DAKOTA,and SOUTH DAKOTA. If you know of anyone in these
states, please ask them to sign up so we have all 50 states.
  Dont be afraid to contact someone you don't know, ONLY If they marked
&quot;COFFEE/TALK&quot;, They want to meet you as im sure you feel the same.
 I'm still waiting for all the - **&quot;I was down on my luck and an AIRS member
saved my life&quot;** - stories, that people promised they'd send me if I did
this site, but didn't. I did my part, how bout you?
  Thanks to all who have made this a great site and continue to help and
support the VW community around the world by being an AIRS member.
