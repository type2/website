Subject: [T2] Tune-up every 1500 miles

Solved.  It was the coil.  So both the bus coil and
the emergency backup were like the `The Bad One` shown
in http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/BlueCoil.html . 
(I`m here to confirm Richard is 100% correct.  LOL!) 
Oddly enough, the correct coil, Part Numbered
BOS-00012, is identical to the Mexican, silver
labeled, blue coil shown at the bottom of the Ratwell
Blue Coil web page.  To make matters worse, the coil
is clearly marked as not containing a resistor. 
Identical to picture.  But, alas, it DOES have the
necessary resistor.  The coil has been mis-labelled
for years, up to and including today.
   
So a workable / correct coil solution is marked in the
Ratwell site as `Made in Mexico with silver label,
Another no terminal dud to avoid, Bosch 9 224 771
008S.`  But for me, this was the solution.  I'm going
to purchase another as an emergency spare.  The coil I
bought DID have terminals, and a type-1 coil mounting
bracket.  The coil is in a steel can, and is not oil
filled.  It has a 6-digit number stamped into the
base; presumeably a date code.
    
Too bad there is such diversity within Bosch for this
Blue Coil.  Bosch used to connote quality.  But this
is a good example of poor quality, mis-labelling, and
general feature confusion between the various Bosch
coil manufacturing facilities world-wide.
