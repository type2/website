Steve,

I found it extremely helpful on my 1980 Westfalia to
find a friendly garage with the old exhaust analyzer. 
Our VWs are old enough so we only have to pass at two
RPM points, as you mentioned (no dyno testing).  This
allows you to see the affect of different adjustments
before the actual test.

I put a new catalytic converter on mine to get it
fairly close (they really clean up the exhaust). 
However, my A/F screw didn't do much, and seemed to
work best when backed out almost all the way
(leanest).  Luckily, I found out my engine ran
cleanest at higher idle (highest allowable 1200?). 
Since I was only missing at low idle I simply set my
idle higher to get it through emissions.  It turns out
a higher idle speed is a good long term solution,
since it keeps hot idle oil pressure higher.

I didn't try any fuel injector cleaner or methanol in
mine, although I've heard these clean things up.  You
could certainly argue injector cleaner would clean up
exhaust beyond the test period.

By the way, I don't think the waiver is good for more
than 2 years, so you get to pay again, and again,
and...You're smart to try to fix it permanently. I had
a rebuild since my last emissions test, so I'll have a
whole new set of conditions next time around.
