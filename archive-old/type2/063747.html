Subject: '74 camper - rusty muffler fasteners

Greetings all

as I am new to the TYPE2 list, and was largely a 'lurker' on the 
Vanagon list, here's a quick introduction. My name is Aaron Sedgmen 
and I live in Canberra, ACT, Australia. My partner in life, Heather, 
and I own a '74 1800 kombi camper and a '72 notch back Type 3.

Now the problem; on the weekend I took the (stock) muffler off the kombi 
and in the process managed to strip the thread off three of the studs 
that fasten the muffler to the heat exchangers.  The problem lay in the 
rust that had 'welded' the nuts onto the studs, caused by the extreme 
heat of the exhaust system.  No amount of WD40 was going to loosen the 
thread on those nuts/studs.

Is there a paint or some treatment that will prevent the threads from 
rusting and becoming cemented?  Would nuts made from non-ferric metal 
be of any advantage? 

Any advice appreciated.

Cheers
