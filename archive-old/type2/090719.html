Subject: Re: [T2] More living in a bus questions

I was living in my westy for a few months in my Uncle's driveway, but they cooked my food and I used thier bathroom/shower setup.

I would say you should buy a generator to use your power outlet, a stove of some kind (weather it be gas or electric is up to you) and some kind of auxilary heater (I have one that plugs into the power outlet and works so well that by morning I'm sleeping with no covers on and sweating while it snows outside!).

I also plan on living in my bus when I go to college at either Humbolt State or Sonoma State universities in the fall of 2003.

My only real problem is showering, since I can't go a day without having one.  So I planned on buying one of those solar showers (it's a bag you fill with water and hook it up to a tree branch while camping and it has a plastic shower-head thing attatched to it).  I was thinking of using that with a pair of swim shorts on in some random parking lot or use a friends every morning.

Bathrooms are easy to come by though, almost any gas station or fast food joint will let you in to use thiers.

As far as food goes, just budget; buy a lot of sandwich stuff and canned goods, and that's about what you're limited to.  Also, why buy drinks when free drinking fountains are rampant?  Also I'm a vegetarian, and I save a lot of money by not bothering to buy meat.

It can be done, and it's not all too hard either since I go and do it for a month at a time or so sometimes whenever I need out of my house.
