Subject: Re: [T2] Main Engine Seal

Some months back I had a devil of a time with main seal troubles. I had a
couple seals shred shortly after install and another just not function
well. I was using the typical silicone seal from a local vw flaps. I sort
of chalked it up to the horrific end play on the tired ancient cobbled
engine and sprung for a new longblock. Now I wonder if the seals were part
of the problem. was very frustrating.

&gt; One of the mags did some reporting on this within the last year....maybe
&gt; in conjunction with their synth oil tests.
&gt;
&gt; Buy German if possible on this....
&gt;
&gt; My rule of thumb...if the difference between German and other is less than
&gt; $10.00, always buy german.
&gt; The differences in price is not worth having  to pull the engine and do it
&gt; over....
