Same junkyard, Washington DC area.

Someone showed me a Michelin XZX they pulled off a junkyard bus just two 
weeks ago.  It looked great!!  I usually pay $25 for a mounted Michelin XZX, 
but he paid less than half t are questionable, but possibly servicable.

I have five Michelin XZX in my garage, and don't need anymore.  I just 
bought a new set Yokohama from tire rack.

Barry Burneskis  '78 Westy  Springfield VA.  (cell 703 861 9506 'cause I am 
going out to see my daughter do soem field hocky as soon as I get the next 
message out...  And the guy/gal that gets to that junkyard today may fine 
some mighty nice pickin's, at some reasonable prices if they talk to the 
RIGHT service rep))
