&gt; I know that splits have no rear engine mounts, neither do saloons. Why then

the simple answer is that the later engines are much heavier, also the
indepeden rear suspension changed a lot of the forces placed on the engine
tranny.  

I would not put in a bus engine without the rear support (I suspect it
could be done) the type IV cars had rear mounts too, and I seem to
remember the type III having em
