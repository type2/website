While I 'm glad to hear everyone had a great time, mine was of a somewhat 
different nature. You see, usually it's just me and my 3 year old son at 
these events and he's a junior member of future bus duds so we can take our 
time and ooh and aah over all the buses. But no! not this time, my wife talks 
me into taking the family friend and her munchkins who are on vacation. We're 
talkin 5 kids here people! was like a snipe hunt at Wally mart with them 
heading in 5 different directions at one time and yelling one thing over and 
over, don't touch that!!. So I only got the abbreviated tour and only met a 
couple of list members. To top things off she blew the radiator in her F**D
so we had to rush home to fix it. Who's idea were plastic radiators anyway?
Man was not made to work on watercooleds!
boy am I glad to get that off my chest!
