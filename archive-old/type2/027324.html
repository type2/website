Subject: long term storage

Hi list
Thanks for all the helpful advice for getting the bus back on the road. 
There was alot of interest in the desiccant (strange spelling, but that's 
what the dictionary says)that I used to keep my bus moisture and mildew free 
for over 7 months. Here's the info:
It's calcium chloride put out by Prairie West Industries, but I got it from 
a True Value home hardware store here in Trail, B.C. It comes in a biggish 
3lb bag cotton bag which I hung from the pop top handle. I placed an ice 
cream bucket underneath and asked Mom (God bless her) to check it out and 
empty it if necessary. The instructions said that the powder would collect 
water which would drip into the bucket. She later said it lasted from Oct 
until late may, taking about 3 litres of water out of the air inside the 
bus. By late May the calcium chloride was all gone and the summer was around 
the corner.
You can get a plastic holder system and a small amount of Calcium chloride 
for about $26 can. in auto stores, but the stuff I used was a bulk bag of 
the stuff.
Good Luck and thanks again
Duane
