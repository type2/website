&lt;&lt;  Those in the know all surmised that the selector carrier had 
broken inside  the nose cone - its about 150mm long with a 15mm 
upright on each end and  about 15mm across  (a long flat bar with 
the ends bent up to make a long flat U shape).
 
 This selector is (so I'm told by those in know) a weak point in 
the system;   in 74 or 75 VW changed the design the used two 
U shaped bars the second about  1/2 the length which made the 
selection mechanism stronger. &gt;&gt;

Close but not quite accurate.  From '68 to '75 it was the plain
selector.  Starting in '76 and running through '79 with the 1st
generation 091 transaxles the selector that Bob refers to is the
same.  What VW did at that time was to spring load the selector
shaft so that it always returned to neutral if out of gear.  Previously,
it had just hung there.  There was the addition of a second smaller
&quot;u&quot; shaped bracket that the two springs perched on but it does 
not add to the strength of the original selector bracket.

I have yet to see one of these break but do see ovaled out 
mounting holes where it attaches to the gear carrier housing all
the time.
