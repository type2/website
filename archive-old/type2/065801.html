I doubt they had to. Germany is pretty eco-sensitive when it comes to
putting all the glass in the glass container and all the plastic in the
plastic container, but when it comes to cars, they have been way behind
- - unleaded gas was only introduced recently, you can still (at least as
of last year, I think) buy new cars without catalytic converters, and of
course, there are still roads with no speed limit. Oh, and that
reformulated gas that everyone hates here but it causes less smog just
got struck down for use in the EU. Oh, well...

One other area where Germans don't recycle much is old cars, due to
their stringent inspection program (TUV). Not a whole lot of boneyards
in Germany - at least not many where you are allowed to go in and pick
parts. Read an article this year in Der Spiegel that going to junkyards
was a new craze, borrowed from the Americans. (?!)

What they DO do, however, is ride the train. 

Whatever. I am thinking about trying to do some kind of a cat conversion
on my bus, just because I don't want to put up with my snooty
ultra-eco-sensitive German friends looking down their nose at someone
who drives a stinky old beast like Millie the Westy. It's a compromise -
I believe in running old cars so that the car companies don't need to
keep making so many, using up natural resources and energy in the
process (side note - why do people think to change from year to year
like fashions?), but I do think that if you're going to drive at all,
you should really drive as clean as possible.

That said, I think I'm going out in the backyard to see if I can get the
heat exchangers open. My contribution to saving the planet - I hardly
ever drive the Westy in the winter! (Brrrr...)
