Subject: Re: Build cool shelves in the tire compa

Quoting Surfer Bob:
..AS I prepare to go to Baja in two weeks, I am reminded of a cool
feature my 78 Westy has that was built by a former owner.

This wonderful person (whom I have never met) made a nice box of
shelves that slides snugly into the cabinet behind the driver's
seat (originally intended to hold a spare tire). There are three
shelves of various heights, with nice wood trim on the front edges to keep
stuff from rolling out. Whole thing is made of thin plywood. I keep a
cardboard box of spare parts and lots of canned &amp; dried food in there.

I posted a while back that you can cut off the 2&quot; lip on the spare tire
cover to creat a FLAT door FLUSH with the other doors and put two cabinet
hinges on the left to creat a cubby that doesn't stick out and lets you fit
stool or toilet easily between seats when front seat is turned around.
I also put two shelves in there (screw on a piece of wood strip to hold
shelf) , biggest space is at bottom to hold cans of gumout, oil, etc. which
stand upright in a pullout box.  Go to sears and check out the 22&quot; &quot;truck
toolbox&quot; which just fits in there and holds lots of tools, being only about
  4&quot; tall.
