Ya I've been getting duplicates of a lot of messages also.  Usually there has 
been a few hours between getting the first copy and the duplicate.  I didn't 
ask the list about this since I also got a duplicate of one message from 
someone not on the list (i.e. they sent it directly to me) so I figured it was 
just a problem with my ISP.  But maybe there is some computer out there on the 
internet that's going crazy?
