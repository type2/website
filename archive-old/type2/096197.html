&gt; Since everyone responded to my question regarding my 009 dist to get rid of it I am trying....problem though.  I can't seem to find a supplier for it.  I do have one, but it is old and I question the condition of it after further inspection...so I figured I would go with a new one....I have tried the two &quot;have it all&quot; places in town...plus I tried  Autozone, Pep Boys, and Napa...nothing.  Anyway, according to the source from a fellow listee the Bosch # is 0231 173 005.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

you will probably have to rehab the old one since as far as I know most of
those dist are all NLA.
