&gt; &gt; Today I was looking at my neighbors 68 Dormobile, and noticed the front door
&gt; &gt; anti-draft windows are stationary
&gt; &gt; I looked thu a few books I have and couldn't find a window like this,,
&gt; 
&gt; Jamie:
&gt; I've seen that before and I think it was normal for 68 Kombis, 221's and deluxes
&gt; and 69 and later had  openable vents.

I think this is a european delivery thing(and maybe canada). Ive seen a
number of us kombis and all had opening vents.
