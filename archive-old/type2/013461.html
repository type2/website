Hey Adam,

I was thinking exactly the same thing.  I'm willing to
bet that *most* people would buy the shirt to have it,
not because it's cheaper it have one of those versus a
generic Old Navy(tm) or Gap(tm) heavy t.  I would want
a type2_dot_com t-shirt or hat because it's cool to be
part of this community.  Plus, wearing a hat is most
convenient at a show.  Wearing a sticker shaped like a
CD with your name on it?  It was interesting, but did
not last nearly as long as a hat would.  It seems like
the calendars that were printed with splitties went
pretty well.  A hat would certainly be in keeping with
the tradition.  Why not got to a local (read anywhere
in the world) and find out what kind of artwork they
require?  Then, just post the artwork to Thom or
Everett's site so that anyone could grab it and take
it to their local printer?  

OR 

Set the price of the merchandise, then have the buyer
pay the actual cost of shipping.  There's no reason in
this day of internet auction sites to make the seller
(a not for profit one at that) pay for shipping. 
Heck, the &quot;handling fee&quot; 90% is BS anyway.

&gt; The t-shirt or hat idea is good...........
&gt; 
&gt; But if it were to fly, why not see if there is a
&gt; volunteer in Europe to
&gt; print/ship, us, Canada, Australia or whatever?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that there are probably t-shirt making
&gt; facilities in all these
&gt; places and then the shipping would not be an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Just an idea.
