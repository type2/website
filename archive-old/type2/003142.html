Subject: VW trucks 4 sale

Good day all,
Well I just got a phone call from a friend of mine that has a 84 double cab
vanagon for sale. I use to own this truck until about a month and a half
ago. I sold it reluctantly to him after years of him constantly bugging me
for it. Unfortunately he blew the motor up this week on a trip to Portland,
it was just after he changed the oil and forgot (presumably) to tighten the
oil filter, for some how it just fell off on the
d:( 
Anyway this truck other than the engine is in perfect shape. No dents or rust in the body or tears in the upholstery The color is utility gray with vinyl seats 1/3 2/3 front and bench back. It also has the hoop and later set up for it. 
If anyone is interested in it, I can get you in touch with the owner. He paid me $10,000 for it, so I'm not sure how much he will take for it now. I'd buy it back myself if I still had some extra money floating around.
It has roughly 94,000 km on it.
Also I am considering selling my 71 single cab to allow room for my current project of a 68 R/H drive crew cab. Basically it is a completely stock truck with only VARY minor rust in the cab floor board. No dents other than tinny door dings and a few small ones in the bed. It also has chrome bumpers and bumper guards. It has 88,450 miles on the original engine and the heads were rebuilt about 4000 mi ago. I want $3500 firm for it.
If anyone is interested in either of these vehicles I will be home Tuesday night and will return all emails then.
Shawn
