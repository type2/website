Subject: Purring 73, data point

Here's another data point for the mph statisticians:

My 73 Westy has demanded a lot of care and cash
this year but it's been paying back with family camping
adventures this year.

My 73 has an 1800cc engine with 
dual Weber ICT's, Jacobs &amp; pointless ignition,
and electric fuel pump.

My latest calculations:
mixed commuting = 16-17mpg
mixed travel, (mountains) = 18-19 mpg
mixed travel, rolling hills &amp; highway = 21 mpg!!!

cruising data:
oil p = 30-40psi (cruise), 12-15psi (idle)
hot day oil temp (sump) 210-215F
cool day oil temp (sump) 180-210F

It is running sweet and pulling like a champ!

The whole family is very happy and repacking the
bags for next week's camping trip.

Thanks to everyone for the generous help, 
 info, and support!
