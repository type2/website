Subject: FS: New Optimus AM/FM Cassette Player

Hey there!

I've got a brand new tape player that's still in the original packaging for
sale. I got the wrong kind, and they wouldn't let me return it, so...
hopefully I can find a good home for it! :o) Here's the info about it:

Optimus 12-2114 AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player

- in dash
- auto reverse
- detatchable face plate
- 7 watts x 2 max power, 4 watts x 2RMS
- up/down seek button
- frequency recall
- auto stereo/mono and local/DX switching for best FM reception
- tone &amp; balance controls
- 30 station memory (18 FM, 12 AM) with auto scan
- digital clock/ tuner
- includes mounting hardware, instructions for installation  &amp; operating

I'm asking $60 plus shipping for it .... a lot less than what I paid for
it. It's brand new and never been used.
Email me for a picture of it. Thanks much!!!

love and light~*~*
Emily
