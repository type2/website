Hiya Seth,

If you didn't mangle the top of the base getting it out - simply put it back 
in place and call it good.  If it broke into basically two pieces you'll be 
fine.  Even some smaller stuff falling in the sump won't hurt - but I'd change 
the oil just to be on the safe side.
Your alternative is to pull the case apart.  I went through the same thing 
about two years ago and everything is still running great.  Me?  I'll wait until 
rebuild time to really take care of the bottom half of the base.
