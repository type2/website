I've been reading as much Bob Hoover stuff as I can find.  Here is
a bit posted to the air cooled vw newsgroup.  Basic run through on 
rebuilding carbs.

&gt; 
&gt; So now that the single weber is off  where exactly can I look to unclog
&gt; things? I have never done this before, but I am very ready!!! I need to do
&gt; it today/tonight to drive the bus to the campout this weekend. I looked in
&gt; the archives under single weber rebuild, but came up short. Is there a link
&gt; on the web for this?
