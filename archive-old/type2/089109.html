Subject: Starting problems in the DEATH BUS

Put the key in the ignition, turn the key, dash lights dim, no starter. =
Cleaned all battery connections + and - , turn the key, no starter. Went =
inside to look at trusty Bently manual, came back out, started right up. =
This has happened with 2 different starters and 2 different coils. =
Should I replace both the battery cable and the ground strap?
