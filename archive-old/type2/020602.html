Before I got the rear rack, I made a bike rack for the 78 Westy That was
mounted to the tire bracket but actually resting on the bumper mounting
&quot;tube&quot; wedged  between the bumper and the body.  It was a board (about
the size of a 2x8) - at the top was mounted a cross board (2x4) about 2
feet long.  To that were mounted horizontal arms that had foam on top to
hold the bikes.  As to your worry about cantilevered weight- no problem
with my sub 20 pound club bike, but if carrying 2 bikes, I ran a center
cord from the bikes to the roof rack above.  The spare tire sat in the
roof rack well.
