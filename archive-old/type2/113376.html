Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way cheaper 

In the 4 years I've been ordering from BD, I've always found them to be 
a great mix of price, quality, and service.  Last Friday at 4:00 p.m. 
eastern time, I ordered a carb I needed ASAP.  I asked for expedited 
shipping, and since their price was $29 cheaper than anyone else I 
could find (according to some quick research), I paid the extra 
shipping (still UPS ground).  It was here in CT this morning! (Monday)  
So in my case, I got the exact part I needed, when I needed it, and 
still cheaper than the competitors list price, not including shipping.  
I agree with others about competitiveness,  and also spread my 
purchases around various vendors, but I usually start at BD and work my 
way around.  More often than not, I usually end up right back where I 
started.
