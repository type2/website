Subject: Re: [T2] `67 engine selection &amp; cooling

That is 100% false.  Did a vendor selling these scoops tell you this or
something?  This is usually vintagebus material....but posting it on there
might stir up a hornets nest....so...
No...it is not necessary.  Put a &quot;doghouse&quot; oil cooler and fan shroud...and
all necessary tin on it...and you'll be good to go.  Make sure your engine
compartment seals are good (this is vital) and you'll have no problems at
all....as long as everything that is supposed to be in place...is.  67s have
a wonderful tranny (they did stock anyways) and I think that a 1600 SP would
compliment that nicely.  I prefer single port engines....less places to
leak....that and I don't like 34 carbs... i know i could use an adapter...but
it just isn't the same....thats another story...anyways.

What seems to be ailing the 1500?  The 1500 I had in my 62 (original small
nut tranny) would push that beast 75 mph if I held it to the metal for a
while.  I only tried this 2wice....and don't recommend it.  I drove 60-65mph
all the way to Missouri and back 2 weeks ago with that bus.  1400 miles in 5
days.  I realize a westy is heavier than my bus...and you have higher
gearing...so that could play a role in it.

Conclusion being...put a 1600 in it if you like (even 1776 if you wanna go
fancy and spendy) and ride with peace of mind. 65mph in a 67 bus should be no
problem at all....without side scoops.
