Subject: THE PROGRESS OF THE SPARK

During the period 1904 - 1930 a series of poems on motoring was 
written by the 1907 Nobel laureate for Literature, in the styles of 
various other poets.  This one relates to recent discussions of how 
to get sparks  -  by filing contacts, or by substituting black boxes 
using Hall or other effects we don't well understand.


	THE PROGRESS OF THE SPARK

			(after Donne)


This spark now set, retarded, yet forbears

To hold her light howsoever so he swears

That turns a metallic crank and, leather-cloked,

With some small hammers tappeth hither and yon;

Peering as when she showeth and when is gone;

For wait he must till the vext Power's evoked

That's one with the lightnings.  Wait in the showers soaked;

Or by the road-side sunned.  She'll not progress.

Poor soul, here taught how great things may by less

Be stayed, to file contacts doth himself address.
