Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

Billy,
Check your VIN to be sure.
If it starts out 226 you have a regular Bus that someone threw some camper
stuff into.  If it starts out 236 you have a hardtop Westy.

The first digit means it's a VW Type 2 (Bus)
The second digit is what kind of Bus.  All the regular Buses that I've seen
had a 2 for that second digit.  The bodies that Westfalia did the
conversions on have a 3 there.  I forget what type of body that was but I'm
sure someone can give us the breakdown.  The trucks would have had yet a
different number there.
The third digit is the last digit of the model year, 6 = '76.
Could also be '66 but you'd know the difference :-)

&gt; I guess I have a '76 hardtop westy as well, as I have all the gear
mentioned above, sans hardtop. I always thought it was ripped out of a westy
(poptop) and stuffed in my kombi.
