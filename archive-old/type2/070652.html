Subject: Re: [T2] 1969 Westfalia Owners Manual Supplement?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Last year I went to look at a 1968 which had the Westfalia supplement 
in the glove box. Odd.y, on the cover was a picture of a bay window 
bus but the cover said 1967 Westfalia. Perhaps it was Euro and was 
refering to production year instead of model year.

&gt;Does anyone know if there was ever a Westfalia owner's manual 
&gt;supplement printed specifically for 1969?
