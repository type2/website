&gt;
&gt; If that(checking your cable connections) doesn't do the trick, check the
&gt; ground strap from the tranny to the frame.  Also, check to make sure the
&gt; solenoid is really receiving 12v from the ignition switch.  Check all your
&gt; fuse block connections and clean them if needed.  You may have too much
&gt; resistance in the long wire from the ign. sw. to the starter(usually
caused
&gt; by corrosion.  One way to get around this is to add a 30A, SPDT Bosch
relay
&gt; to the circuit.  I have done this to my '70, and it works great.

&gt; &gt;My 70 PopTop wont turn over unless I hook jumpers cables up to the
&gt; &gt;battery... Battery is good, but she wont turn over any suggestions??
