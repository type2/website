Subject: Re: [T2] STRANGE OCCURANCE

Darren,

I once experienced a problem just like that one on a different make.

It was the battery, one plate had broken loose and was shorting
intermittently and completely, I thought we were going to set the car on
fire from frustration until, ....

we just replaced the battery, a thought.

Andrea
