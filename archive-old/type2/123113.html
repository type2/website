&gt; &gt;   We're here holed up and roughing it at the Embassy Suites just above
&gt; &gt; Baltimore, MD.  We had an itinerary change that took us to Maryland, so

&gt; my suggestion, is the NJ turnpike to the last exit before Geo Wash bridge
&gt; and then get on the Palisaides parkway and then over the Tappen Zee bridge

whoops, skip going over the bridge and stay on 9W
