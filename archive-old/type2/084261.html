&gt; &gt;I'm planning on turning my '78 Bus into a camper and I was wondering if
&gt; &gt;there are any reference materials, books, magazines on the types of

&gt; &gt;old buses and make it fit?
&gt;
&gt; I suggest you do your own thing.  Use some stock Westy stuff, make some things,
&gt; and use some over the counter things that never came stock.  Unless of
&gt; course, you
&gt; can afford that English camper interior you've been told about.  Nice!
&gt;
&gt; Well, personally, I've got a stock '70 Westy, and the layout isn't all that
&gt; great.
&gt; The icebox is tiny, front opening, and basically useless.  The later
&gt; refrigerators,
&gt; so I've heard endlessly, are nothing but trouble.  Following Bob Hoover's
&gt; advice
&gt; (he hangs out for weeks down in Baja) I got a super-insulated Igloo
&gt; cooler--not the
&gt; un-insulated sort available everywhere.  The cooler can now be taken out of
&gt; the bus,
&gt; as well as used as a seat (with appropriate sized cushion) at the table.
&gt;
&gt; The rear facing seat (on a '70) is slightly too small for a porta-potty, so
&gt; I'm going to
&gt; make a near duplicate that isn't.
&gt;
&gt; Curtains are better held in place with rare earth magnets sown into the seams,
&gt; than the stock aluminum tracks with little plastic thingees sliding in
&gt; them, and snaps.
&gt;
&gt; The stock things I'd use are the folding bed with storage underneath (or a
&gt; Z-bed),
&gt; the folding table, and the shelf above the bed.  If your passenger seat
&gt; swivels around
&gt; to face the rear, as the later Westies did, then use the later style table
&gt; to take advantage
&gt; of this seat.  If not, then use the early table position, and put an early
&gt; loaf sink/water supply/
&gt; ice cooler cabinet behind the passenger seat, but replace the ice cooler
&gt; with storage
&gt; cabinets.  Aside from those, you can really do better going non-stock.
&gt;
&gt; Bob Hoover discussed his thoughts on the matter--he lives in his bus a
&gt; lot--somewhere
&gt; or other in his writings, which you can find here:

Rik,

Thank you very much. I am going to print this message out and keep it to refer to.
I am thinking of building a custom cabinet to house my DVD player and TV which
will reside behind the front drivers seat so I can watch from bed. The DVD is
already set up for 12V but the TV I'm looking at is a standard 13&quot; using regular
110V plug. ( I work for a DVD/TV manufacturer so I have access to  these items). I
have heard of a power inverter but I'm not sure if this is the route I should go
or if I should get a video source already made for automotive applications even
though the screen size is so much smaller.  Any thoughts? I realize I will need an
extra battery but I am getting conflicting opinions from the guys at work on
wether to get a standard battery or a marine battery.

Buster is going into the shop next week to get his mechanicals fixed, after which
I will be looking for interior parts and especially a z bed.

I love the curtain idea. Sounds perfect but does this mean I have to learn to sew?
I knew I should have paid attention in Home Ec. It's pretty sad when a good little
Mormon girl from Utah can't even sew or can peaches! :) I'm sure I can get one of
my friends to do the sewing honors.

Thanks again for the help!
