Subject: Riviera slide rollers

Since the subject of Riviera's came up dose anyone on the list have extra
roller units that ride in the tracks allowing the top to slide up &amp; down.  I
am in need of one that has been non-existent since the purchase of the bus
10 years ago.  I know procrastination.
