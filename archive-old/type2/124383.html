Subject: FW: [T2] Molding for roof panel

I recently replaced mine ( a 70 westy ) with some stuff I bought from JC
Whitney that worked really well.   I was actually surprised how well it
worked.

Here are the details:

Item SD890796X Standard Edge Trim, (Style B) white 3/16&quot; -1/4&quot; thick x
5/8&quot; height Quantity of 1 _at_ Total Price:$17.99

It was more than enuf to do the entire hole.

Hope this helps,

-mike

'70 westy  (weinbus)

Hello all,

I am looking for the molding that goes around the hole in the roof of a
1970 Westfalia.  You know the stuff that helps holds the wood paneling
up above the rear seat.  The paneling and/or the molding have shrunken
over the years and no longer make contact so that the panel is sagging
badly. Can I get something that'll work at the local hardware store?



Thanks- Asaph
