Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

Thanks for the suggstion michael, but to my way of thinking the &quot;key number&quot; is 
stamped on the very door lock I would be potentially sending him? :) Kinda 
defeats the &quot;security thing&quot; don't it?

Once again thanks for the info

michael

&gt; I don't have his card, but a fellow at Mannassas Bug-Out (virginia) has a
&gt; booth where he cuts keys for you on a VW cutter which nibbles the key based
&gt; on that code on your lock tumbler.  He  said he'll make a key if you send
&gt; him a tumbler (easiest is from rear cargo door); don't just send the #;
&gt; it's a security/antitheft thing.   If # isn't visible, he'll put a &quot;feeler
&gt; key in and determine the right code for the tumbler!    Anyone know this
&gt; person's addie???
