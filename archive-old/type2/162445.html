&gt; So what are my options? Do we have J-tubes available to replace the whole
&gt; stinking heater box system? I don't care about heat anymore, I have Mr. Heater
&gt; etc. I want a DEAD SIMPLE exhaust system !!! What's out there to fit my 77
&gt; Westy that won't hang down too low etc? and might actually NOT leak!!!????

I have on my 78 used J tubes (made from a 72-74 heater box). and the Bus
Depot sold stainless muffler for the 72-74 bus. it has worked reliably for
over 5 years and except for a place where one of the J tubes cracked and
needed welding I have not had any trouble with the system.

as far as I know all parts are still avaliable.
