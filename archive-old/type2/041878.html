Chances are you'll be surprised to see how cruddy you lock assembly is- I
took mine out and soaked it in solvent to get the crud off. Lubed the whole
thing up w/ WD 40, now its slicker than ..well, WD 40. Took about
45 minutes on my '78 Bus.
See &quot;door lock broken&quot; thread earlier this week.

Subject: oiling locks


&gt; The locks on my van are sticking, requiring lots of jiggling of the key to
&gt; get anything open.  Anyone have a recommended cure? Graphite powder?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help,
