Subject: Re: [T2] WR1

The rationale behind the WR 1 is straightforward. It is not &quot;another&quot; 
solenoid, it's a relay. Its purpose is to reduce the resistance in 
wiring between the battery and the starter. This is ohm's law, which 
last time I looked was good science.

&gt; They add insult to injury. Seriously look at your starter and how it

&gt; another one. When ever I see these things I *&amp;%#$ rip them out.
