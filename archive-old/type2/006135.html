Subject: Magnetic Oil Drain Plug OK?

Does anyone know if there are any problems with installng a magnetic oil
drain plug in a Type 4 engine?  If it matters, it's a 1978 2.0L, fuel
injected with hydraulic lifters.  It seems that I read somwhere that you are
not supposed to install one on a Type 4.

Thanks.
