Which way should air be able to travel?  Should I be able to blow air to or
from the motor if I blow air through the valve?  Is it possible I just have
it on backwards?  There is an arrow on the valve that points toward the
motor that says &quot;motor&quot; and that is the way I have it installed.  I tested
it myself before installation.  Ahhhhhhh.

Sounds like you must have a leak somewhere in the hose or maybe the valve is
defective.

&gt; I am having a bit of a problem.  I have installed new brakes 
&gt; all around and
&gt; taken a test drive.  They work GREAT, however, when I apply 
&gt; the brakes at
&gt; idle, the motor dies!!  I replaced the vacuum assist line and 
&gt; check valve.
&gt; What's up?  Anyone experienced anything similar?
