Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber 

http://www.wicothesource_dot_com/new2/default.htm

look in the online catalog under chemicals (pg.59) for rubber cleaner. That
is the first place to start...gotta have clean rubber...then here is where
the rest of gets fuzzy...see I was only 19 when i used this stuff and now I
am 36...my memory ain't what it use to be...I will find though...give me a
bit. I suppose a food grade silicone spray would work the same as the gel I
used many years ago.

&lt;&lt; Steph,

 When I serviced video games we had some silicone stuff that we treated the

rubber bumpers on pinball machines with...it worked nicely. I had also used

it on the rubber seals of my Ford Maverick. It is a silicone gel lubricant.
