Subject: Help! - Rubber parts ID

Hey folks... Hoping someone can set me straight and provide the &quot;official&quot; name for some rubber parts. Without the &quot;official&quot; name I can't seem to find these little parts. 

I am removing, cleaning and greasing all of my cables. Naturally the original rubber boots at each end of the cable tubes have rotted to oblivion. Looked at the Bus Depot site and I'm sure they have them if I had a number, looked at the Mid-America website and again I can't find them. I know I could have found them by sight in the Motorworks catalog but naturally it is hiding. 

Parts I'm trying to ID: the rubber stop for the clutch pedal (keeps it from rattling against the floor), the dust boots at both ends of the accel cable tube, rubber boots for the heater cables, and the same for the clutch cable. If their one at the front of the clutch cable? 

I'd look on ETKA but I haven't installed it yet, removed it for some computer R&amp;R a while back. 

Trans-vair update: shifter in and adjusted, clutch cable rerouted, cleaned, and tonight I'll adjust it. Later this week: loctite the axle bolts on the axle adapters, bolt down the front tranny mount (holes don't line up so I have to wled up the adpater bracket holes and cut new ones), and go for the first test drive. Still no muffler but if it will run around the neighborhood I'll drive it to the muffler shop 2 miles away for a pipe.
