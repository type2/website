Subject: Paint jobs

I've located a 79 I'm considering. It is 550 miles away and I think I will go 
check it out next week. It was recently painted. I've received both E and 
snail mail photos and it looks really good. My concern is the owner told me 
that there are some minor dents in the body. I can't understand the logic of 
a person going to the trouble and expense of a paint job and not doing the 
prep work. My question is, can a total novice(me) look at a new paint job and 
tell if it was done to hide something? Is it possible to paint one and have 
it look great, only to have problems surface later? I'd like to think that 
even to the untrained eye that a poor job and maybe painting over &quot;a little 
rust&quot; would show up even to me. Should I get the number and contact the shop 
that did the job? Thanks in advance for any opinions.
