&gt;   Poor boys block heater.  Drain oil into gallon jug, set behind
&gt;woodstove at night , pour into engine next morning, start bus and go.

	Good one Mark.
	A more luxurious way is installed at my local fire station. 
The dipstick on their mighty Scania turbo is a special model 
containing a small electrical resistance heater, supplied by a 
sliding plug in the floor under the vehicle.  The boys can thus 
hammer the motor up to reak pevs within seconds of piling aboard. 
One can see the automatically disconnected lead on the floor of the 
station when the engine is away.
	I suppose it does mean someone has to crawl under the engine 
to reconnect it when they get back from the job  ...
	Pre-heated oil will save most of your engine wear, even in 
temperate climes.
