Subject: Axial play on Cam Gear

I received a camshaft on Monday, purchased as an NOS camshaft from an individual. Today was the first nice day in weeks that I've been able to steal any time at all for the bus.

When I was cleaning the camshaft, I noticed a slight bit of axial play--that is, I could twist the gear a tiny bit on the camshaft. I tested my old camshaft and found that one to be perfectly tight. I checked Wilson and on page 96 he says:

&quot;Stand the camshaft on end, with the gear flat against the bench. Hold the gear firmly in one hand and try moving the camshaft. If there is movement in any direction between gear and cam, the gear is loose on its rivets; replace the entire assembly.&quot;

Don't get me wrong. It's not a great amount of axial play. It's maybe 1/2 to 1 degree out of 360 degrees. Probably even less. I did not notice any side-to-side or up and down movement of the camshaft on the gear. 

I'm wondering if this is the movement Wilson was talking about. Have any of you seen cam gears move axially? Is any amount of axial movement acceptable?

BTW, the person who sold this to me is obviously an honest person, so please don't assume someone's ripping me off. If there is a problem, I'm sure it's a mistake...or something he simply wasn't aware of. The camshaft/gear assembly still had plenty cosmolene on it.

Thanks! Joe
