Subject: cleaning vinyl seats

You guys get the idea I'm taking my rust bucket to it's first show?

My original, basketweave seats (especially the driver's seat) are almost
tatooed with engine oil.  I've found that car top vinyl cleaner, scrubbed in
with a toothbrush, gets it out, but it's excuciatingly slow.  Any
suggestions?
