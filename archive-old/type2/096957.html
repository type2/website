Subject: Re: gas shutoff valve

just get a barndoor shutoff valve from wolfsburg west - 60 bux or so, and
worth it (tho if you want to make it work from the cab like on the early
busses, it takes some work and welding - i just crawl under and don't worry
about i).  i have one on the 70, and cackle with glee everytime i use it.
