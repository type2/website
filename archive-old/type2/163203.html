&gt; Google is your friend:

Got it...But another Google down welding lane
tells me that the Henrob torch may/may not
be all it's cracked up to be...The welding for-
ums I read were pretty much in agreement that

I'm just passing the info on to a welder who had
heard of the torch and asked about it...
Thanks anyway... ;-)
