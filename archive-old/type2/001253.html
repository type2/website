&gt; Although many suggested that I would find this part at an RV shop, I
&gt; have tried 2 shops and failed.  Here is what the old one is identified
&gt; with under the hinged plastic cover.
&gt;
&gt; A web search was unsuccessful.  Does anyone have a Santa Anna phone book
&gt; to see if this company is still around?  Any other sources for this part?


If this is the white city water hookup on a '75-79 Westfalia, I have it in
stock and on my website.
