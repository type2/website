Folks,

Not only is there asbestos in the tubes from the heat exchanger to the =
'body', but there is also asbestos in the heat exchanger as well!! (At =
least there was in my '77 heat exchangers). I don't know what years this =
would be true for. The asbestos in the heat exchangers was between the =
fins and the outside metal - presumably to keep the heat of the fins =
from burning thru the outside metal. I pulled off my outside metal to =
clean the inside when I found this out. I removed it and gave all =
surfaces a scrubbing with soap/water and a wire brush. I also am using =
flexible metal tubes from the exchanger to the body. It's noisy, but =
only when the heat is actually on!

As far as I know there is NOT any asbestos in the tubes from the fan to =
the heat exchangers.

Ed
