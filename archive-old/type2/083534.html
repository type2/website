Subject: RE: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself

&gt; Sounds like it should work.  The bleed hose may have a tendency to jump out
&gt; of the container due to the squirt pressure when you hit the brake, so you
&gt; may want to immobilize it somehow.  Otherwise you make a mess like I did.
&gt; You can also buy one-man bleeder hoses with a check valve at auto-parts
&gt; stores for a few bucks; but your plan will probably work just as well.

I havent done well with the valve type.
the other method works fine although...
-open the bleeder minimum to prevent air leaks
-lift the pedal slowly to avoid sucking air through the fitting
-keep reservoir full
