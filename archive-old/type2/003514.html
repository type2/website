&gt;BTW, after two hours on my knees I began to wonder whether or not the fan
can be removed without dropping the engine. Would anyone happen to know?
Bentley didn't clear this up for me. Looks like there are three 12 point
socket-head screws holding it on.
&gt;Thanks

Good news about the temp lowering after cleaning the fan, Rich.

Yes, you can remove the fan without dropping the engine.  I just had the fan
and fanhousing off, and changed the oilf pump and the motor mounts without
dropping the engine.  Don't know if it was worth it, but it can be done.

Regards,

Grant
