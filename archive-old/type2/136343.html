Subject: electrical gremlins in the charging system ( 74)

First off.. Merry christmas.. (cause it is!) :-)
after chasing what seemed like a intermittent problem that was
causing my battery/brake lights to come on I installed a new alt.
in DAS bus. At first I thought voltage regulator.. nope.. then I
thought
battery.. (5 years old) .. nope
The light would sometimes come on at idle and go off at revs.. then
sometimes it would be off at idle then on at revs.. suspected loose
ground somewhere as the heater fan was acting screwy too..
.... I was in denial. :-)
  Installed the alt and the lights no longer come on and the heater
booster fan works fine (knock on wood).
  Thanks to the tech article here
&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm&gt;
for some heads up.. as I hadnt ever had to do this particular job. Some
excellent advice and insight. The only difference for me is I didnt
remove
the adjustment bracket.. I unhooked the lead from the starter and
pushed
the wire back through the firewall as far as it would go so that I
could
get enough slack to pull the alt out far enough to get to the back
cover
plate and the connections on the alt underneath.... once the wires and
cover were of I just picked it out and replaced it with the new one..
reversed the procedure to install the new one.
  All in all a time consuming job. One you dont want to rush so you
dont
loose parts but technically not to demanding.
