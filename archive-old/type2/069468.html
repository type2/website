Hi,

I missed the beginning of the thread, so I don't know what year your bus 
is. I do know, however, that when I replaced the (rear) brake shoes on my 
'75, there was no need to remove the axle nut, despite of what the 
Bentley book said.

If this does not apply to you, then I recommend you buy and use an 
&quot;impact wrench.&quot; Not sure what their real name is, looks like a big 
bottle opener, perhaps 8-9 inches long. Comes in two sizes (I think 36 
and 46 mm) and it loosens your axle nut with just the whack of a big 
hammer. I think I paid between $5 and $10 at the local bug shop.

Sami
