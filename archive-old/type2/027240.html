None of the codes you mentioned appear to be the correct code.  The code for 
the Vanagon ignition switch is located on the lock's outer cylinder, not the 
main lock housing.  You'll have to remove the lock assembly to get to it, 
and it will then be stamped on the side.  It will be a 4 number code with no 
letters.  As a registered locksmith who specializes in VW, I can assure you 
that it is there.  You may encounter a bit of difficulty finding a locksmith 
who can code cut that key, though it's not THAT uncommon.  I can do it and 
Fedex or ship any other way if so needed.

As far as hot wiring, that wouldn't be difficult, but getting the column to 
unlock would be.  Just remove the ignition lock and get the code 
number...the Bentley shows how to rmove the lock.
