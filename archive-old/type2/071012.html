Hey New guy I just replaced the wood a little while ago. I looked everywhere
for it. 
I ended up finding it at a local building center. It is really used for
bathrooms. The one side of it has this white coating on it but the other side
is plywood
It is not original, originally they used Birch plywood, but I couldn't find
any anywhere
The plywood I found was thin enough and It looks pretty good installed
I think it cost me $21-$25 dollars, and I replaced all the wood in my van.
Good luck, I hope you find it. It took me a little while to locate something
that wpould work at a reasonable price.
I saved all the old pieces I had, and used them like a template for cutting
the new stuff.
