...but sometimes to a limited extent.  Always check out the Home Owner's
Association if applicable.  Some of the guidelines set up for the
&quot;protection&quot; of the neighborhood are not kind to inoperable vehicles.
I've been visited by the sheriff twice just for such reasons.  Luckily
he was a nice guy and said everything was alright by him.  I can just
see the nosy guy down the street sneering as he peeks out from behind
his curtain... &quot;Rats, foiled again!  There must be some way to get rid
of the long-hair and his POS!&quot;  

Good luck!
