Subject: Looking for Mechanical Fuel Pump 1973

I have currently replaced my mechanical pump with an electric one temporarily
until I can find one to replace it.  I still have the old body of the pump.
Does anyone know where I can get a mechanical fuel pump for a 1973?  or
possibly a rebuild kit or something?  I have scoured the internet and tried
all the major sites I know of with no luck.

Thanks,
Lee
