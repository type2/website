Subject: Wire harness desperately needed!

Hi all!  Update on my &quot;fried solenoid wire&quot; project.

Have removed the alternator, had it tested, it's OK.

Bought new starter &amp; new voltage regulator &amp; am about to install.

My mechanical skills are coming along nicely.

Trouble is, I can't find the all-important wire harness ANYWHERE!  This is
the wire harness &amp; wiring that runs from the starter to the voltage
regulator and alternator.  They don't make them new anymore.  Busted Bus in
Boulder has one on an old bus, but they &quot;might be able to get to it in a
week or so&quot; (it is a pain to get off) and it costs $60.  Called about ten
used parts places and nobody has it.  We're in Colorado Springs with no
wheels and need to leave town this weekend - was hoping to get the bus going
to go to the Denver Bug-In on Sunday.

Does anybody have one of these harnesses lying around or know where I can
get one?  I am considering making one - the rubber grommets on my
super-fried wire are all OK - but am worried it's beyond my expertise, and I
really don't want this to happen again due to my ignorance.  The wire fry
was so bad I'm really lucky I didn't lose my entire bus.

Any ideas or tips are much appreciated!

Thanks!
