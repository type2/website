Subject: RE: [T2] Duncan's new bus (oops/power loss update)

It was said:

&gt;When you say 'rattle-can' it - I assume this is stick some close colour
over
&gt;it until it gets to the spray shop to have the proper job done?

Spray paint, yes.

**  Danger, danger Will Robinson  ! ! !  Many painters will NOT want to 
paint over someone elses paint, nor even over someone elses primer.  Talk 
about a resurrecting paint FART, just ask about Rustoleum!!
