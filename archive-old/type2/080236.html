Subject: Re: [T2] rear vent window

Or if you cannot find a replacement piece of glass - pull the piece from 
the other side and have a glass shop dut a duplicate and have them send it 
off to be tempered (safety).

If you really have some extra money (couple hundred) replace all the glass 
with new tempered tinted glass - the tinting is in the glass, not an 
external film that gets scratched...

Same glass store can do this.

&gt;You may find that in the long run it would be better to forgot the vent 
&gt;window. Get a solid piece from a the right side of a junk bus, buy a seal, 
&gt;and put it in the left side. Those little windows are usually the source 
&gt;of a lot of rust problems in buses. Should be a cheap fix.

We had excessive rust in the vent window on the driver's side rear. I 
replaced that section with a single piece of glass.

If I ever find a good set of vent windows I would add them to both rear 
side windows but I really doubt I find those. My frame was no where near 
useable. The seal traps alot of moisture. Terrible design.
