Hello all.

You know, there's not much better than a warm, sunny afternoon, a mellow
buzz, a back country road in your VW bus.

Having said that, Asheville, NC is still the best town I've ever been in
(and has more busses), and Maggie still shows me why VW busses are the best
vehicle ever made.

Happy Monday,
Eric
