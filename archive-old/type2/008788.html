78 VW  Champagne Edition

Needs some assistance from the list, on this one..
Yesterday..Al Brase and I were on the topic of
Champagne Editions..re: vans.

Al Brase wrote;

&gt; Champagne editions were a sales promotion
&gt;done in 77 and 78 and included at least bugs and rabbits and busses. It
&gt;seems like the previous owner sent along a flyer showing the various 78
&gt;models. The 77 I think was white with similar brown and biege tape
&gt;stripes. The 78 camper was offered as well, but it was a different
&gt;color. I only saw 2 other 78's like mine in Iowa since I bought it in
&gt;82, but any type 2's are quite scarce in Iowa.  . 
&gt;You might ask the list about the scarcity.
&gt;Incidently the exterior is called Fox Red, and Datenut Brown; the
&gt;interior is Burnt Sienna and_____ (can't remember, Dark biege,maybe).
&gt;The package was referred to in the parts book as: S765- special sales
&gt;promotion. Mine had all brown dash and plastic and soft steering wheel.
             **********************************
So question(s).......

&gt;&gt; How many of these types were produced by VW  or imported to
&gt;&gt; U.S./Canada  for that year?  Are they that rare a model??
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Was 78 the only year the produced the Champagne Edition?
&gt;&gt; I was checking archives  and some other material I have,
&gt;&gt; but couldn't come up with anything concrete on this?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Was there ever any literature on these units?

Any info the list can offer..thanks in advance.
