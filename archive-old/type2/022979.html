X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

I've always tried to plan so that roadtrips in the bus involve as little 
preparation and teardown as possible.  The reason for this is that the 
memories of packing and preparing for days in advance to go camping then 
spending another day to clean everything up when we got home took a lot of 
the fun out of camping.  Unfortunately, everything broke down this time and 
we ended up working frantically for hours, up until the last minute, and 
even then I had to take off work early to get things done and we ended up 
leaving an hour late.  Part of this problem was brought on by the discovery 
of deep cracks in three of my four tires and the need to get them replaced 
within 48 hours - thanks again to everyone that contributed to that 
effort.  There were no tire-related failures on the trip!

We left Wednesday at 5pm with a full load.  Fridge full of food plus an 
extra case of assorted beverages, clothes for three people, bedding, 
folding chairs and table, and an arsenal of spare parts and tools including 
an extra cylinder head and driveshaft.  I have found that bringing a spare 
part seems to prevent that particular part from breaking, and I worry most 
about cylinder heads, so I always put one of those under the seat.  Filled 
up with gas at $1.61/gallon, highest price we paid on the whole trip I 
think, right in hometown Texas.  For a state with a lot of refineries, gas 
has gotten relatively expensive here.

As we headed towards the freeway Bonnie and I both noticed how quiet the 
bus was.  This was partly from the new tires (LT8.5x27x14C TrailFinders 
from Discount Tire) and I think partly from the Q-pads I installed last 
week.  Bought one box of them for $23 and put them on the forward-facing 
firewall which has very little &quot;stuff&quot; covering it in the Safare 
floorplan.  Since the search for a good alternative to Q-pads seems to have 
turned up nothing, I've decided to just buy a box every now and then so the 
price hit won't be so noticeable.  Coasting up to stoplights in neutral we 
could barely hear the engine anymore.  Very nice - I can't wait to stick on 
another box.  Once on the freeway, I noticed that the bus tended to wander 
more than before, not helped by the constant 10mph south wind.  We were 
headed NorthEast on I-30 towards Little Rock.  At the first stop I let the 
tires down from 40/45 to 36/42, which helped a bit.  The extra weight in 
the bus, much of it up in the highroof on the slide-out bed, probably 
didn't help.  Had to pay a bit more attention to trucks and road conditions 
than in the past.  Stayed near Little Rock, AK the first night - got up and 
on the road by 8:15am.  Picked up I-40 and cruised all the way through 
Tennessee.  Nice drive, especially the Eastern portion.  Made it within a 
few miles of Asheville where we stopped at a KOA and squeezed in between 
two 40+ ft motorhomes.  I usually don't stay in KOA's but this one was 
there when we needed it, had hot showers, and was &quot;relatively&quot; scenic.  We 
parked out front and walked up to the closed office, where the note said to 
grab an empty site and pay in the morning.  As we turned back towards the 
bus, a man drove hurriedly up and opened up the office so we could pay our 
$24 right then and there.  No doubt he figured we were a flight risk.

Friday morning we took our time with the remaining 250 miles, stopped and 
did some shopping, etc. and arrived at the park about 3pm.  Up until we 
entered the park, we hadn't seen a single other bus heading our way and 
were beginning to wonder if it was the right weekend.  :-)  We were 
relieved to finally see the Everybus signs pointing us towards the group 
camp area.  We were early enough to score one of the edge sites with 
electricity, which enabled me to plug in the very hip (I thought) 
Baywindow-shaped lamp that my lovely bride-to-be got me for Easter and 
leave it running all night.  Also a way to charge the batteries for the 
&quot;Scruffy Huffy&quot; E-bike.  Next to us was a 2001 Eurovan Winnebago camper 
with not one, but TWO tents!  On the other side of us was an early 'loaf 
with the Mystic (green, blue, gold, etc.) paint job... kewl!  Todd was 
quickly absorbed by the local gang of children who were having a blast 
riding bikes, playing on the open grass fields and in the suprisingly nice 
playground.  We met up with Ted Finesman, Poor Richard, David Raistrick, 
Steve Dolan, Mike Benthin, John Yost (sp?), Denmeister, and of course 
&quot;ncbus&quot; Chris the organizer, and many others whos names I can't recall at 
the moment.  Of all the campouts I have been to, this one seemed to have 
the highest percentage of listmembers present - a real who's who of the 
type2 list.

Some cool things about Everybus, in no particular order:

1)  The automagic bubble-making machine.  Sheer genious!  I want one.
2)  Ted's 100 proof cherries - what a way to make friends... with the floor!
3)  Chili cookoff - I only had room for 4 kinds and they were all awesome.
4)  Case burning - the biggest I have been to, but I missed the water 
balloon... drat!
5)  Kids games and prizes - The kid-friendly attitude made the campout a 
pleasure for all.
6)  Art show, puttputt golf, paddle boats and hiking trails - Lots to do at 
the park other than camp.
7)  Rob (of FMBC) giving me a full-color sales brochure for a blue Safare 
Custom Camper!!!  Whadda guy.
8)  The weather.  Partly cloudy, moderate temps, NO RAIN!  :)
9)  The nice people in the Class A motorhome who put up with our 
festivities and let us take pictures from their roof.
10)  Poor Richard's T-shirts, which we were lucky enough to score two of 
when we arrived.
11)  H. Steve Dolan for carting around my transaxle for 9 months.  I owe ya.
12)  Chris for putting this whole thing together.  I owe you too.
13)  Winning the long distance award.  :)
14)  My lovely fiance Bonnie for enduring the 2,200 mile trip with me.

We decided to take the Southern route home, down 85 through Atlanta and 
then to I-20.  On the good side, we got to stop and enjoy some pizza with 
Sami and Maria Dakhlia &amp; family and Unca Joel on Monday evening.  On the 
bad side, it added about 100 miles to the trip and the road conditions were 
not as good.  Lots of mobile homes on the road, too.  One guy with a 14 ft 
wide mobile home on the back of his truck decided that 65mph wasn't fast 
enough and passed us!!  That was hard to believe.  Sunday night we stopped 
at Table Rock state park in South Carolina.  The cost was $17 but the 
restrooms were clean and the campground was beautiful, and practically 
deserted.  There was a Vanagon Westy that we waved to on the way in, but 
when I went back to talk to them just before sundown, their van was closed 
up and they were nowhere around.  We built a nice campfire and just sat 
around and enjoyed the beautiful forest and the peace and quiet.  After 
dark, we heard noises in the bushes and spotted a raccoon with the 
flashlight.  Monday night we encountered the first rain of the whole trip 
in the form of a thunderstorm while we slept.  It continued to rain most of 
the way back to Dallas on Tuesday.  We arrived home at 7pm, pretty close to 
on-schedule.

More semi-technical ramblings, read if you like that kind of thing.

This was my first trip with the Dellorto DRLA 40 carbs and Royal Purple 
20/50 synthetic oil.  I've switched from Mobil 1 to Royal Purple because 
Mobil 1 is up to $4.60/quart and there are rumors that they've changed 
their formula for the worse.  I saw (in person) an oil comparison between 
various brands and was impressed with how well the Royal Purple protected 
metal parts in extreme conditions.  I want to qualify this paragraph by 
saying that I don't believe that Royal Purple buys you anything under 
normal conditions, but when there are engine problems such as overheating, 
abnormal metal-to-metal contact, etc. I think it might provide a little 
extra protection, and my tired engine can use all it can get.  Mileage on 
the trip was acceptable at just under 17.5 mpg overall - about 1mpg less 
than the stock carbs used to get me (I plan to go to 132mm venturis (from 
134) and 130 mains (from 140) in the future to hopefully increase mileage a 
bit).  Oil pressure was up over the 15/50 Mobil 1 - I never saw below 30psi 
and temp never went over 220, even in 85 degree temps with the A/C on at 
freeway speeds.  Power was improved over the stock carbs - I was able to 
hold 60-65mph on the freeway and pulled nearly every hill in 4th gear, even 
some substantial ones in Western NC.

I was hesitant to drive over 2,000 miles round trip to Everybus with a 
questionable engine.  I was going to rebuild a spare 2-liter engine for 
this trip but didn't start it soon enough, so I took a chance and 
fortunately didn't have any problems.  About 18 months ago when I was in 
Las Vegas, I did some damage to my engine pulling a long grade on the way 
to Busses by the Bridge.  Foot on the floor, 50mph, couldn't go faster, 
afraid to slow down.  Oil temp went through the roof but I didn't want to 
stop because of safety concerns - dangerous road, no shoulder, big trucks 
in a bigger hurry tailgating me.  Nighttime.  After that trip, I drained 
the oil and it was full of very fine metal particles.  There was also a 
light knocking sound at low rpms that wasn't there before - I'm pretty sure 
it is a loose rod bearing.  Last oil change I put in Valvoline Synthetic 
20/50 instead of the usual Mobil 1 15W50 - coincidence?  Compression was 
down to 70 lbs in three cylinders and 90 lbs in the fourth.  Yes, you read 
that correctly.  Still idles smoothly, still plenty of power, still capable 
of nearly 20mpg.

I drove the bus around town for a few months after that, and it didn't get 
any worse.  Next oil change, the oil was free of metal.  When it came time 
to move back to Dallas, I loaded 1,300 lbs of belongings into the bus and 
drove it home over the 7,500ft passes on I-40.  No problems.  I've put over 
15,000 miles on it now in this condition and it is still running great with 
no signs of getting worse.  If I had infinite time and money, I would have 
replaced this engine long ago, but life's not like that for most 
people.  Not everyone can pull the motor and replace their bearing dowel 
pins every 12 months because the metal may have weakened slightly from heat 
cycling.  I may go for 100,000 miles on this engine, just for 
S&amp;G's.  Change oil.  Keep in tune.  Drive 'em.  The next engine will also 
be 2-liter hydraulic but with a 107i webcam and total seal rings, when I 
get around to building it.  The VDO extension hose (for the dual sender) 
which recently failed will be replaced this weekend by a pair of 1/8NPT -&gt; 
AN3 adapter fittings and a 16&quot; length of Earls braided stainless teflon 
hose with AN3 ends.  I recommend that anyone into long-term solutions do 
the same - it wasn't expensive.  One less thing to worry about.

Happy Camping!

-David
