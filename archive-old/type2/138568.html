Subject: RE: [T2] Official AIRS Update... Take 2

First, thanks Greg for taking this on, will be a great thing when done.

I am a programmer but work with the microsoft tools, SQL Server, asp_dot_net, C# 
and such. I can't recommend using these technologies because hosting could 
be very expensive. Really need to go the open source route witha MySQL 
backend and php or other front end - which I have no experience in.

I can possibly help some with database design issues or application design 
(have been developing database driven web apps for 4 years now) but I can't 
offer any actual coding time, I'm just 100% swamped.

Seems you first need to see where it is current hosted and what you can use. 
What is the current backend and can you easily export to a text file or XML 
to import into a MySQL database?

And I totally agree about no java or flash, can't stand either. Think the 
web should be silent and just images/text with options for the fancy stuff.

And I could volunteer to contact TN users to find out if they still exist. :
