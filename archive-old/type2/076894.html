Subject: Re: [T2] Retractable Seat Belts

Has anyone on the list called their local VW dealership about getting new 
belts?

A friend who drives a 15 year old Jetta tells me that he called their local 
VW dealer (many hundreds of miles from here) to get updated belts - seems 
his only has shoulder belts and knee bolsters. He is convinced that the OEM 
shoulder belts minus the lapbelts would fail him and allow him to possibly 
be flung out the sunroof in case of a bad rollover.

He says that the local VW dealer could supply the correct retractable 
lapbelts for about $40 a seat. Dunno if this means the lap+shoulder belt.

Anyone?
