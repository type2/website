       BusFusionites, dates for BusFusion 2004 have been set.  June 10 ~ 13.
Make your plans now to attend BusFusion 2004 !
       The BusFusion website has had a lot of updates over the past week.
Many more links to photos of BusFusion 2003 have been added.  Pictures by
Frank Condelli, Gerry Edge and Stan Madore are now available for your viewing
pleasure.
       Many of you are receiving this BusFusion News e-mail message for the
first time as you attended your first BusFusion this year and your address has
just been added to the BusFusion mailing list.  Welcome aboard.
       Remember please the BusFusion 2004 logo contest.  All those who
attended BusFusion 2003 are eligible to submit one design and will have one
vote in determining the logo to go on the BusFusion 2004 T-shirt.  Get your
designs in early so we can all have a look at them.  They will all be
published on the BusFusion website.  A deadline for submissions and date for
voting has not been determined yet but let's all be proactive and get to it
soon !
       Don't forget VolksFest in Embrun, Sunday August 3.  After that I'm
getting ready to leave for the IWCCC's Madeleine Islands adventure and hope to
see many of you there.   Good travels to you all and enjoy the rest of the
summer.

Cheers
