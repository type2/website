Hi list -

I'm getting ready to put in my GEX rebuild.  Their site recommends replacing 
the oil cooler w/any swapout.  I expect that, given the source.  What do 
y'all think?  Is it not worth the money (scarce right now) that I'll be 
saving?

Does anyone have a recommendation on how to THOROUGHLY clean out an oil 
cooler?  Like, a good method of cleaning out the core?  What type solvent 
can I put through the cooler to make sure I'm getting everything out?  How 
do I know I AM getting everything out?

Also, are there any &quot;must replace&quot; type things I should do now, w/the motor 
out &amp; save some time/sweat later?

Thanks so much,

Mark
