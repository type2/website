Subject: Re: front triangular window

its a bit of an ordeal the frame as it needs to come out as an assy.
You should be able to fix glass and latches with it in place though. 
The glass is just press fit into the seal and will slide out with a
little encouragement.
The latch is held into the frame by 2 rivets youcan see from below.
If you want the frame out
-pull the latch, handle and door panel
-unbolt the window and set it doun into the bottom of the door
-remove the window channel (held in place by clips)
-there is one screw up top and one hex bolt on the bottom
-it slides out top in towards the back of the bus and a little wiggling
and its out. 
good luck
