Subject: eng/cyl oil leak+stud query

I'm the listee with the running fine 194K original engine.........
Got tired of the drips and removed to cover tin of the pushrods &amp; took the
78 Westy to a nice local blast it yourself car wash and got it CLEAN under
there.  Drove it home, drove it back onto ramps, jacked up the front to
level and checked it out.
1. The MILD&quot; engine noise I was hearing appears to be a loose manifold to
head connection.  Just a little blackening around the cavity there.  With a
guaranteed 194,000 mi on these, one nut takes a 11mm socket now &amp; I'm
willing to bet it's rustwelded to the stud.  My worry is (1) I can heat the
nut with a torch welding tip and get it off but the threads may be toast &amp;
I'll be stuck (2) can try undoing stud with the nut, but it might break
(then what?) or loosen and see #1!  Any other viable options?  It's been
doing this for over a year and hasn't gotten any louder.  My instinct is to
leave it until that inevitable engine rebuild.
2.  Other than the fixable pushrod seal leaks, I noticed oil appears to be
coming from the engine/cylinder connection.  (oozing, not dripping)-When I
pull the valve covers for the seal work I could tighten the lower head
studs (as Muir claims you can)- any negatives to this fix?  Anyway of
getting at the upper head studs?
   I'm going to Woodstock in 12 days and pulling the engine is not a
current option.
