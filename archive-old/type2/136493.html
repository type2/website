Subject: News pictures of the '67

Those of you who have been here a *long* time may remember when I bought
an
old 1967 hardtop camper.  Well, that bus went down to Kelly's place in
North Caolina and Kelly did a whole lot of work to get it back into
rust-free condition.  He just brought it up to Mark Deering in Virginia
and Mark has about done the final body work and paint and is in the
process of putting it back together.  I went down there yesterday to
deliver the bumpers for painting and took a couple of pictures. They can
be see at:

or the whole story is at:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/~dworkin/67bus/

I hope to pick it up on the way to Everybus and show it there.
