Thanks for your respone.
Allow me to clarify a few things. There are three buses involved:'72
7passenger in ok shape,69 7passenger in almost mint condition, and the
salvage bus that is at Doc Ric's farm.  I am getting the interior from the
junked 69 westy. As far as I know it is a true westy. The sink/icebox is
gone and I swear there was an overhead but maybe it was put in later. I
assumed that there were curtain rods in the bus somewhere but we all know
what happens when we assume. I was gonna just sell the '72 because the '69 7
passenger is taking its place. But campers in any shape seem to get more
attention then passenger busses.So........
Thanks :)&gt;
