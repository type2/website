Subject: Re: [T2] Greetings and my first question...or two.

Hi Hogan,

If this bus has been sitting for an unknown length of time I would 
STRONGLY recommend you replace all of the fuel lines ASAP. Buses are 
prone to fires in the event of fuel line failure. It only takes an hour 
or two and the line is not that expensive.

As for the smell, I would suspect that it's leaking from the filler 
neck or possibly from the breather lines. Richard Atwell has a great 
diagram for gas breather lines on this page:

Just scroll to the bottom for the gas line info.


Happy trails,

&gt; Also, I've been getting the smell of raw fuel after I first start
&gt; driving it and if I go on curvy roads, but driving down the highway the
&gt; smell goes away.  Thinking maybe a hole/crack in the fuel tank
&gt; somewhere?
