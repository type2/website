Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum leak from brake booster line

&gt;The problem you'll probably encounter with replacement 
&gt;is that you may not be able to find a replacement hose. 
&gt;This hose is reinforced with a spiral piece of         
wire (read spring )that keeps the hose from collapsing 
under the vacuum that its subjected to.

Bus Boys (www.busboys.cc) carries the correct reinforced 
booster hose. Part #N20390.12 for 10.75/ft.
Locally you can try parts houses that specialize in 
european cars, FLAPS doesn't have it, they will try to 
sell you heater hose.
