&gt; I'm not sure that I'd brag about driving a vehicle, that's inherently
&gt; unstable at high speeds (cross winds, anyone?), at 80 mph.  Or am I just new
&gt; enough to this to not know whereof I speak?  Would it be true to state that
&gt; such speeds are possibly beyond the T2's design limits?

The manual says the top speed is 75 mph but you can go faster. Check your
tires to see how fast &quot;they&quot; are designed to go. If the bus was designed to
go much faster it would have a taller fourth gear or perhaps a fifth from
the factory. The engine is loud at 75mph for a reason and you need lots of
horsepower to overcome the wind resistance at those speeds.

I have to agree that the biggest factor is brakes. The hardest stops I've
done was when I broke in my rotors. I feel safe going 55mph and trying to
stop from it. At 80mph the stopping distance in a bus is so dangerously long
that you really need to do something like put 944 discs on. Upgrading one
part of a bus and not the rest is sometimes a recipe for disaster because
the folks in the cars in front of you have far superior brakes.

Anyway, going 75mph with a Type IV is no less or more dangerous that doing
that speed with a Corvair motor so lets stop nagging Steven with our holier
than thou driving habits and congratulate him on his engine upgrade.
