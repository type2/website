Subject: Oil temp

Just bought a VDO Oil temp gauge with a dip stick temp sensor. What is an 
acceptable temp and where do I pull off the road and let her cool down. I'm 
planning a trip to the rockies in a few weeks and an oil temp gauge was 
suggested. Just took a trip to the store and back and it just topped 220F.
