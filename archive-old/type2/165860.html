Subject: Newbie Question

Newbie here.  Just got a 1978 Type 2.  I took it to a local VW shop, and
they told me that the first cylinder has low compression, and we should
probably replace or rebuild the engine, but the parts are pricy, so
replacing it is probably the best bet.  I've always wanted a 78-79 bus, so I
don't plan on giving up.  I'm getting the service manual, amd was going to
look at How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen air-Cooled Engine (All models, 1961
and up).  I only have ~$1000 to spend on it until next month, and would like
to get it at least remotely runable by then if possible.  I'm enlisting my
dad and brother to help me, so before I get too far, I wanted to ask some
question.

What would you guys do in my situation (rebuild, used, wait and get a
rebuilt engine)
I've been told the 78's are more difficult to rebuild, and the parts are
really pricy.  How much are we talking?  How much does a used engine run? A
rebuilt engine?
I've helped my dad rebuild a more modern car, and would like to rebuild
Any recommendations on reading.

I'm starting out doing my own research, but found the list and decided &quot;who
better to ask&quot;!  I already planned on putting some serious cash into it,
just not right this second.  Any info, suggestions, and help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Chris Miller
