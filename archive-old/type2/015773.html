&gt;When getting a second hand flywheel, be sure to check for cracks in the
metal of the flywheel. Severe heat can cause these cracks. Then, under the
force of rotation, once installed on the engine (and while you're tooling
down the road at top speed - 65 ;), the flywheel can explode into many pieces.
&gt;
&gt;The cracks are very small, but can be seen with the nekid eye (or glasses
if you're far-sighted). Look on the clutch side of the flywheel.

I agree with Joe about cracks, with the stipulation that small radial
cracks on the surface where the clutch disc presses against the flywheel
are common and not serious.  Do not discard a flywheel because of these
type of cracks - resurfacing will remove them.
