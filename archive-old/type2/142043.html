Subject: Oxygen sensor voltage

Hi Mike,
         Don't know if this would help you, but I bought an oxy sensor tester 
kit by Owatonna on eBay some months ago... never used it.  Would lend or sell 
cheap if you are interested.  If not, I would offer it to anyone on the List.  
Loan also a possibility in the Baltimore/Washington vicinity.  Glenn

I don't have my bentley at home this weekend as I forgot it at work, which is
over an hour away!  I'm trying to remember how to test whether the oxygen
sensor is giving a reading or not.  From vague memory it creates a voltage of
0 to 1v does it not?  79 cali bus the oxy light just came on, and i noticed a
drop in mileage. pretty sure it is the oxy sensor but would like to verify
before going and spending the $70,  any tips to lead me in the right direction
would be apreciated.  thanks        Mike
