Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring Harness Fabrication

Zach,

    Look end on at the connector slot, you should see a small square opening
on one side of the slot. If you push a small jeweler screw driver in that
slot, and pull on the wire it will come out. The connector has a small &quot;tab&quot;
on it, make sure it is bent up enough the lock in place. Push back in to
reinstall, pull to check to see if its locked in.

&gt; I have to rebuild the wiring harness that connects the alternator to the
&gt; rest of the bus.  I am having some trouble removing the contacts from the
&gt; plastic 3 conductor plugs.
