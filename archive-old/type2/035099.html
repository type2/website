 How can I
&gt;replace the tray without screwing up the paint?
&gt;
Here's how I did it on my '71 Westy.  I cut, ground and generally removed
both my very rusted trays, leaving behind the flange they are supposed to be
part of along the inside face of the outside body steel and the rest of the
sheet metal along the engine compartment side.  I wire brushed off as much
loose rust, etc. as I could and ended up with two big holes and little
ledges around each.  Cut out a cardboard template to fit (even easier than
it sounds), and cut two pieces of sheet sheet from welding class stock (good
stuff, maybe 16 guage).  I know you've bought your trays, but my way you
don't need them.  Worked up a good bead of epoxy all around and just pressed
them into place.  Coated that with two thorough coats of Endure (didn't know
about POR-15 at the time, seems to be working OK), then laid on primer and
top coats of white Rustoleum.

No rust working up anywhere so far in this rust belt.  Pretty easy and
cheap.

Also, your running temp is going to go down.  Nice benefit, on top of a
cleaner engine compartment.
