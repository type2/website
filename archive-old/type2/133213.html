&gt; I own a 75 Westy with a manual trans.  Three years ago, I was in a car

&gt; (automatic, obviously) for use by a disabled driver - I'd love a bug at some
&gt; point too.

hi, I'm also a wheelchair user and have a 78 bus with auto tranny that I
drive with hand controls, I've had this particular bus now for about 12
years and now do pretty much all the work on it.  I have every kind of
jack, winch, and crazy tool you can imagine, the bus is the perfect
vehicle for a disabled person to work on, the engine is at wheelchair
height or you are laying on the ground.  never need to stand at all.

&gt; I drive with hand controls and, yes, I realize the lack of power steering
&gt; will give me a workout since I have to steer with one hand.  I also need to

yup. I have right hand controls (I'm a lefty) and my left arm is a lot
stronger than most people can imagine.  also when parking etc I just let
the bus idle and pull with both arms while it slowly moves.

&gt; be able to get my wheelchair in and out and a/c (maybe a swamp cooler?) is a
&gt; must.

I have an HPBus modification that was the original low floor bus, (check
out photos on Gregg Potts bunch from JohnBrownsBuses)  unfortunately the
HP bus mod is very rare nowdays in fact I have never actually seen another
one.    so probably your best bet is a lift.  the underfloor (UVL) fits a
bus perfectly as do most in door lifts.  unfortunately you will have to
transfer to the drivers seat, drive from your chair is impossible becausee
of the wheel well.  the bus door is huge, even bigger than most full sized
vans so getting thru should not be a problem.  My bus is empty in the back
so I am not sure what moving of stuff you would have to do for a westy.
  Get the 75-79 bus because it has a newer design and stronger automatic
tranny

wish I had A/C mine had it in when I got it, but it was long beyond
repair.  instead I put a  aux heater and dual battery in place of the A/C
and yes it can be a sweat box until I get moving,  so far no major
problems there.  this bus is my daily driver so I has to be reliable.

&gt; Let's put the creativity I know you all have to work!  I look forward to
&gt; your input.


check the photos

where are you located?
good luck
