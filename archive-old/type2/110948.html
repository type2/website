Subject: idle problem w/ 34 pict-3 solved

A big thanks to everyone that suggested things to solve the idle
problem I had in my 66 (which started all the sudden). Turns out it
was electrical. The PO had spliced two wires together for the power
for the coil. The connection was right behind the carb, so I couldn'
see it. Everytime I went back to check it, there was 12 volts at the
coil. Well on the way to Natural bus the problem started to get in
regular driving. Finally the bus completely quit just 30 miles from
NB. It must have finally come apart at the connection, b/c there was
now no power to the coil. I found the bad connection, spliced a new
wire in &amp; off we went. Man I had it when electrical stuff doesn't
completely die, tracking down an intermittent problem is a pain.
