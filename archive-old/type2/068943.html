Subject: thanks..tire carrier

thanks to all who posted info on a tire carrier.  Turns out that there isn't
someone who makes a carrier that fits into the original 3 emblem holes ONLY.
 All carriers I found needed extra holes drilled.  How sad.  Seems to be the
consensus that the 3 emblem holes would'n't hold the tire by themselves
anyway.
