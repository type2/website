&gt;Predictably, the assumption leads to wasted time/money, more waisted than
&gt;actually required to diagnose in correct order and find and fix the problem.

So what is the correct sequence when diagnosing idle or running faults??

Before anything else, verify all maintenance is up to date, including 
battery rest voltage/cable cleaning and maintenance. Still have a problem?? 
Follow this sequence. Replace the word &quot;verify&quot; with &quot;assume&quot; in any item 
you want at peril to your time/money assets.

1.) VERIFY compression balance is within spec.
2.) Verify valve clearances are spec
3.) Verify spark energy at the gap
4.) Verity timing
5.) Verify no vacuum leaks
6.) Verify fuel delivery pressure and volume
7.) Verify injection or carb issues last, only after all other systems are 
verified as spec.

The result is that you will not miss the problems and spend not one bit 
more time/money than is necessary to actual fix the problem, the whole 
problem and nothing but the problem.
