Subject: vacuum vs. 009
Date: Wed, 30 Aug 2000 01:25:39 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'll keep this short:
I have :1641cc unleaded 1971 Bay with 009 dizzy and plugged 34PICT3 carb.
Have retarded timing as far
as TDC without losing pinging _at_ high revs in 3rd/4th under load. Cannot
retard further as bus fails to pull away properly lurching like mad.

Will a vacuum advance dizzy cure this problem ( are planning a long trip
soon will family in bus and plenty of hills on the way )?
Is there a specific vacuum dizzy for the 71 year.....if not, did they get
better with advancing years, should I get a later/new one?
All help on this subject appreciated, I just gotta lose that pinging.
Garp
71 Dormobile.
