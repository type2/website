Subject: Snap-on tools

I ordered a micrometer standard from Snap-on tools. $20.95, plus tax, 
plus 9.95 shipping: $32.16 for a rod of metal 3&quot; long. Okay, I expected 
to pay for accuracy and I begrudged paying $10 to have the item 
shipped.

What I didn't expect was to open the box and find a tube of ratchet 
grease. $32 for ratchet grease? Are they freaking kidding?

I know, it's just a mistake, and the season calls for charity. But 
crime - oh - nee. Premium prices should mean getting simple things 
right.

Mark &quot;I just want to know what 3&quot; on my caliper means&quot; Hineline
