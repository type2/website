Subject: Can someone help me find an annoying part#??

Listers,
    Ok, since my engine is sitting in the shed awaiting the return of its
heads, I decided to go through my engine compartment and replace, scrub or
repair any and all crusty looking items that I could find.  I came across
the boots for the side marker lamps and man were they shot.  They are
deteriated to a point that if a part # was on them, it is now not.
Anyone have an idea of a source or part #??

TIA
