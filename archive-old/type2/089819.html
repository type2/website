&lt;&lt; I think you would be better off just doing one section at a time so you
always have a bus that is close to ready if need be.  So many people get
&quot;burned out&quot; on such a large project once they get into it.  Having your bus
driveable from time to time will keep you motivated.

Yes indeed! I'm on couple of other lists and there's always a couple
of &quot;project&quot; cars floating from owner to owner to owner...
