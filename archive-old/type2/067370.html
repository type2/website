Subject: VW Parts Microfiche FS

I have *finally* cataloged the Official VW Parts Microfiche that I 
purchased back in January.  I have already sold all the Audi fiche 
(thanks Tom F.) and am now ready to sell the extra set of VW fiche.  

I have priced these to sell separately.  They are the large format 
(roughly 7&quot; x 9&quot;) and list the parts available at the date of 
publication.  So the '93 EuroVan will have lots of parts depicted for the 
sheet published in '93, but the '68 - '79 Bus will have have quite a few 
parts &quot;no longer available&quot;.  Along with the parts listed are nice line 
drawings of the parts and their relationship to each other.

The publication dates range from 1978 to 1994 (most are 1992/3) and cover 
most models.  Prices range from $3 - $20 per sheet depending on model, 
age, number of pages printed, and how I was feeling the day I priced them.

I have a list available for anyone interested.  Just ask ...

(Sorry, the '67 and earlier Type II fiche is not available)

When I first talked about this back in January I received several 
requests for specific fiche, but I have since lost that file.  I regret 
that my poor memory forces me to begin anew ...
