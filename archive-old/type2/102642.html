Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

Oh no - - - don't mix me up with Ceebers in VA (was HIS name Chris - I 
missed that). I - Chris M. - am a confirmed cheap skate and prefer Corvairs.

Or rather my wallet prefers Corvair transplants.

When I get to drive it for real then I'll report if it was really worth all 
the studying, scrounging, and tinkering.

My 110 HP is really only about 90 HP with the tin, cooling, and exhaust. 
I'll be faster than before but the Moostangs have nothing to worry about.

&lt;grin&gt;



&gt;So my bus weighs about 3200 lbs with me in it....with one of these engines
&gt;I should be able to get to 60mph in about 7.5 secs or so!  I even added
&gt;.3 secs for wind resistance.  Way cool! this makes it almost as fast as my
&gt;F.rd SVT!
&gt;
&gt;Maybe Chris is not so far off as to put one of these in his bus!
