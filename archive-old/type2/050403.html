Subject: [T2] SoCal listees---need tires?

Greetings from behind the Orange curtain---
    Through some cosmic quirk, I have become the owner of a cheap, slightly 
thrashed '86 Syncro Westfalia, which could be tons of fun, or and endless 
money pit, or both.  Anyway, right before I got it, the DPO installed brand 
new tires which of course were all wrong for the car, but should work ok for 
non-Westy buses.  These are Michelin MX 185R14, 94R, 1540_at_40psi, less than 
1K, w/warranty.  If anybody wants 'em, $50 for the lot.  (These are still 
mounted on the Vanagon rims, but are off the car, so you would need to return 
my rims).  Obviously, reply off-list if interested.  Thanks!

Matt Q., Laguna Beach, CA  '77 Westfalia
