Bus People,

My girlfriend and I have just returned from an eventful trip to
Pembrokeshire, West Wales, for the Week (Lost all our oil on the way down
thanks to a badly fitted gasket in the head valve cover of my 1600 '73
Devon).

 We had an amazing time, the West coast of Wales is breathtaking. The land
has been farmed for thousands of years and yet it still has a very natural
feeling to it, humanity living in good harmony with its environment. Life
just seems to come from every cranny, hedges alongside roads are so dense
with so many different types of plant and have stood marking the same
borders for hundereds of years. We were camped overlooking an estuary which
would transform twice daily. Starting as an open sea lapping the sea walls
underneath pretty cottages and in hours becoming a huge beach which you can
drive along happily park up the van and spark up a fire. Just have to be
very careful to watch the tide and keep that salt water away from my old
friend.

Anyway, the problem that we became aware of was a distinct smell of fuel as
we slept. We have a rock and roll bed and have our heads right at the back
by the back windscreen. The smell comes from the right hand side as you look
to the front and comes from the area above the petrol cap. I have recently
replaced the fuel tank breather hose which I thought would clear up the
problem but it hasn't. The PO did some modification to the interior is there
a chance that he could have punctured the tank. Does anybody have any ideas,
I apreciate that it's unlikely, I just need to start sniffing the problem
out. Are there any problems for which this is a symptom?

Also, I towed a little RIB on the back of the van, would anybody out there
tell me that I am a cruel owner for doing this, I thought that Thom coped
pretty well with the extra weight he does have a new Dutch Verge heart, I
hope that the losing of the oil from the valve cover and the towing of the
boat wasn't too bad for the old boy's arteries.

Next trip is going to be a bit longer, ferry to Holland then through
Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and back via Italy and France. Should
be around 3000 miles including going over the Alps, seems like a long trek
to me but I imagine in the states that's not too far. Better get the source
of the fumes by then or I won't get my favourite side of the vans bed back!

I love this list.

Max
