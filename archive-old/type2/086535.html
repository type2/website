Subject: hissing sounds / charcoal canister and HEAT!!!

Ok, on this topic, what are those tubes/pipes/whatever that go up into the
air intakes up on the side of the bus, and seem to connect just above the
motor in the firewall stuff? Mine are connected to nothing at all, and
appear to be missing whatever connects them to each other, or whatever else
they go to....

I looked around and the only disconnected hose I found came off of the top
of the charcoal filter, perhaps this is where those two tubes should be
connected to?

Any suggestions appreciatted.

As for the heat in my bus, wow. I finally figured out what everyone meant by
wiring the heat flaps ALL the way open. All I did in the past was verify the
dash lever for it actually moved the line, which it did, but not even
halfway open it turns out. I wired those all the way open, and wow do I have
some heat now. I never would have believed you could get this much heat from
a bus before... crazy german engineering.

&gt; &gt; &gt;today i spent some time checking out the bus. nothing
&gt; &gt; serious, however i was running the engine, and i
&gt; &gt; noticed hissing noises come from the rear of the
&gt; &gt; engine(that is, the side closest the the rear bench
&gt; &gt; seat and gas tank). what the?!  im thinking-
&gt; &gt;      power loss + hissing noises = vacuum leaks
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matty,
&gt; &gt; Do not get confused by the 'noise' of air moving thru the thin wall of
the
&gt; &gt; plenum. The plenum is the black chamber on the top middle with the 4
intake
&gt; &gt; runners coming out of it. The wall is so thin, you will swear there is a
&gt; &gt; vacuum leak there....
&gt;
&gt; Matty,
&gt;
&gt; I agree with Karl 100%.   In addition, the sound of air &quot;leaking&quot; between
&gt; the idle adjustment screw and the throttle butterfly can really fool you.
&gt;
&gt; Really the only way to tell that you have a vacuum leak is to hook up a
&gt; vacuum gauge and see what it says.  Before  you do, iit is always a good
&gt; idea to set dwell, timing and idle speed.  Then plug in the gauge and see
&gt; if you  have 15+  inches of vacuum.  If you do, then nothing is seriously
&gt; leaking.
&gt;
&gt; A vacuum leak will usually not cause a loss of power, at least not
&gt; directly. It will cause your engine to run leaner and thus hotter, and
&gt; once you  burn a valve or punch a hole in a piston, well, *then* you have
&gt; a definite loss of power, but fixing the leak will not cure it.
