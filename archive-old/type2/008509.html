&gt; Jan, I would not worry about compromising the &quot;stock-ness&quot;  of the
bus. 
&gt; Take me for instance, I am getting ready to swap front beams from a
1972
&gt; Westy to my 1970 bus.  This way I have disc brakes.  Think of this
as an
&gt; added safety feature.  If you look at the bus you will not really be
&gt; able to notice the change - and hell, as far as I am concerned, it
only
&gt; adds to the value of my bus.

I'm doing the same thing but with a '73 beam into a '70 bus. I chose
the 73 due to the better(thicker) pads. I will have to change the
wheels to the small bolt ones. I was going to put the booster on my
old drum beam, but I would have had to weld on a plate to the old
beam. Not worth it to me, I will have the disc's and a power booster.
I am also changing the rears to the 73 drums, so it will all match. It
helped that I had a complete 73 parts bus. Good Luck
