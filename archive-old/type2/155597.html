Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

&gt;  she also sounds like she misses _at_ idle but she
&gt; drives great, the shakes go away and power seems normal when accelerating.
&gt; when i come to a stop _at_ say at stop sign or light the shaking starts
&gt; again.


It sounds to me like you have a vacuum leak. Small enough that it smooths
out under load, but at idle you can feel it.

Check out Richard's page here:
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/VacuumHoses.html

Use one of the several methods to detect the leak: Carb cleaner (I don't
like this around rubber), water squirt bottle, and my favorite, an unlit
propane torch. Don't smoke!!! ;-)
