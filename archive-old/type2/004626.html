&gt;Now, I'm not saying that rebuildable Type IV cases will become extinct
&gt;in any of our lifetimes, as that is in all likelyhood not true.
&gt;However, as time goes on, they will continue to get more expensive,
&gt;just as they become more &quot;rare&quot;.


I'm going to throw some things in, this subject worries me.  I personally
think converting a T4 to upright is foolhardy for other reasons but I will
note what really concerns me.  First, cases, not a bit, they are still very
commonly available and cheap enough, free even at times.  And even if they
need their first line bore after 1-2 rebuilds they still proablably are
going to go a half million miles.  Frankly the T1 situation here I would
find more of concern.  Sure you can buy a new 1600 from South America today
from Beetlemex, Scat, whoever.  But tomorrow? the upright engine is merely
hanging on by threads as it is down there.  The beetle had to be heavily
subsidized to still even sell with all the other neat things VW is making
south of our borders.  Eventually and I'll bet within about 10 years, VW
cases will finally end.  Then what will happen, about all the German cases
still in the US are at the end of their useable lifespans, particularly
performance wise.  I've been quite suprised that one of the major parts
houses doesn't start a darn aluminum T1 casting already.  To me it seems the
time is right, the prices would probably be right considering what a new
Mexican case costs these days, and the way everyone and their brother is
knocking out heads, cases are probably in my mind far less complex.  As the
billet stuff available is out of most peoples price range, it seems a cheap
cast aluminum alternative would have to be at hand, particularly if the
magnesium ones quit coming.  Anyway the thing that really worries me for the
T4, heads.  Apparently there isn't sufficient interest in the aftermarket to
start knocking out a quality performance or even stock version and the
useable cores are getting few and far between.  As the AMC quality has been
patchy at best, and as I'm not sure they are still making them or just
selling out production, it makes me strongly reconsider exactly what I toss
as trash today, what seems beyond weldable now might be a good find 10 years
on.  Basically for everyone with T4 engines I'd simply say, start hoarding
stuff now.  Grab a used dead T4 for $50 today, take it apart, clean it up,
oil it down and put the parts in a clean dry place for tomorrow.  Other
things to worry will be stock quality P&amp;C sets, though I guess Stephens must
be having someone in Asia making their new 95 and 96 so probably those will
be around worse case.  And how bout internal parts, bearings and the like,
just who the heck is going to find it profitable to be making T4 bearing 10
years from now.  As well as cranks, no shortage today but I'll bet we'll
start seeing a lot of 1700 cranks being reground as 2.0's in a few years as
regrindable 2.0's get hard to find.  Again only smart to start conserving
for the future, though chances are far more likely in my mind you aren't
going to have anything to put the engine in anyway unless the bay and
Vanagon aftermarket really pick up for trim, interior, running gear, those
sorts of things.
