When you say mechanical lifters do you mean hydraulic or solid? since
they are all working in a mechanical system they all might be
considered mechanical :) The only reason I ask is they are set
differently &amp; that will cause problems if set incorrectly.

&gt; Saturday my Van started misfiring and I spent all day today
&gt; troubleshooting it.

BTDT.

&gt; I inspected all the spark plugs and found all but #4 to be a healthy grey.
&gt; #4 had a thin/ wet layer of black.  Conclusion: combustion was not occuring
&gt; in #4 cylinder.  Either valve seat failed, not holding compression, or fuel
&gt; injector is not putting fuel into the chamber.  Since the spark plug
&gt; appeared to be &quot;soiled&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; I assumed that my valves aren't seating
&gt; right.

Before suspecting the fuel system, I would start with a compression
check of all cylinders. There are lots of links &amp; information in the
archives about doing this. But since you can't just go down to the
local FLAPS and pick up a fuel injection tester your best bet is to
buy a compression tester &amp; see what it tells you about your engine.
I don't have a lot of experience only a few years w/ VW, but on all
the engines that I have had a cyl go out (like burnt valve) the
compression chamber gets oily/dirty/wet. A compression test will help
you see this or let you know not to worry about that possibility.
 
&gt; I lined up TDC with #4 cylinder and checked the valve alignment.  The valves
&gt; were in spec.

I think I'm just reading it incorrectly, but just in case. did you
align the same mark on the crank pully as you do for TDC of #1? or the
mark 180 degrees from that mark? The mar 180 degrees from TDC of #1 is
the correct one. Otherwise your valve adjustment will be incorrect.
Sounds like you did it correctly, just trying to eliminate any
possible simple errors that don't take much to verify/fix :)

&gt; That is where I stopped.  Am I right to suspect the fuel injector?  What is
&gt; the best way to test the fuel injector?  I have seen various suggestions on
&gt; the archives but not
&gt; sure if I should take apart the fuel injection just yet.

John Anderson has mentioned that autozone carries Lucas injectors for
a nice price that are new, but I would check the compression of that
cylinder first. Then look at the fuel system.
