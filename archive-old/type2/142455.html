&gt;A while back, someone wanted to know how much various years of Buses
&gt;weighed.  I had a chance to weigh mine today.
&gt;
&gt;1972 7 Passenger Bus with CV engine.
&gt;
&gt;Weight on Front:  1300 lbs
&gt;Weight on Back :  1780 lbs
&gt;
&gt;This was done without me inside, full tank of gas, no cargo other than my
&gt;tool box.

My results for 1978 camper:
