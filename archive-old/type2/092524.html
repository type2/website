Subject: Junk oil filters was Re: [T2] *Long distance drivers

&gt;I have heard, many times on our lists that Fram filters are cr*p, and

&gt;Sure Fram filters are cheap to buy, and easy to find, but I think that's 
&gt;part of the problem. We keep buying the cheap ones, so they are plentiful, 
&gt;but we have to hunt down the good ones, such as the Bosch, and maybe pay a 
&gt;little more.
&gt;We put good oil in our engines because we know what's best for them, 
&gt;maintenance-wise, but does it make sense to skimp on the filter? You decide...

Sorry to pop your balloon, but the Bosch oil filters are designed to 
compete with the crap market and are crap. Get the Mahle filters, or 
genuine VW, which are made by Mahle. Everything else is risky. And if you 
change your oil BEFORE is gets filthy, you can reuse the filter a second 
time and your cost is no more than using the cheap junk.

Look at the threads. If they have burrs and sharp edges they are junk 
production. If they are smooth and nicely formed like the Mahle, Kneckt, 
Mann or Hengst you have at least some empirical evidence of quality 
production. Always smear some clean oil on the seal and a few drops on the 
threads for installation and wipe the mount clean then turn them down 
tightly by hand. Note that ALL European production comes off the showroom 
with these quality brand filters only.
