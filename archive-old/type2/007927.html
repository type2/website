	I have seen Karman Ghias, Beatles, super Beatles, and things; I've seen
early and late busses, I have seen square backs, notch backs, fast backs,
and even the Type3 Ghia; I've seen the corrado, GTI, Fox, Sirocco,
Rabbit, Cabriolet, Vanagon, Jetta, Passat, and more Volkswagens, but I
have never seen a Type4, and there are parts or pictures of them in any
catalog or magazine I have.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is what
are these vehicles and what do they look like, do they go by a different
name or what?
