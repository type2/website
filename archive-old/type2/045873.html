Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?Size 24 Battery

Bob in Houston sends:

&gt; Over on the other side, where some put an extra battery,
&gt; I find that another size 24 battery box will hold:
&gt; 
&gt; 3 quarts of 40 W oil
&gt; several oil change filters
&gt; spare oil change plug and nuts
&gt; 4 spark plugs
&gt; spare belt
&gt; spare voltage regulator
&gt; spare dizzy
&gt; extra set of keys

NOOOO!!! Not the extra set of keys!

Sooner or later some punk is going to open your engine lid looking for cheap
mayhem, see that box in there, open it...next thing you know, you're one Bus
short.

Everything else is good. But no keys.
