All I have seen is Hammerite in rattle cans. What I have used thus far on
the new roof rack parts from PIP, it looks great.  As stated before what
made me use this product on a brand new roof rack was the recommendation
&gt;from Greg at PIP. I have also used it on patio furniture and the more I use
it the more I am impressed. As for the wood, that makes more interesting.
Of course here in the Pacific Northwest we get lots of rain.  The rain will
ruin unprotected wood in short time.  The wooden rails on the roof rack are
coated with some type of coating. But I don't think it will stand up to
continueous duty.  I am not knocking PIP.   Again thanks.
