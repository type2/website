don't pull the engine.
there are some vent tubes from the fuel tank that are almost unseeable but
follow the lines along the side behind the spare tire well in the engine
compartment, near the firewall there is a flex fitting, probably the leak
is there

&gt; This is on a 79 type2 micro. 2 liter. Anyway, All of the sudden I am
&gt; having a gas leak in the area of the firewall on the drivers side. I
&gt; first noticed it after filling up w/ gas. it was dripping from somewhere
&gt; I couldn't see. the fuel lines on this side of the tank seem dry. I can
&gt; see it very well at a piece of foam that is sticking out from behind the
&gt; firewall.
&gt; 
&gt; It goes away after sitting for a few minutes. I have tried to recreate
&gt; it by both running just the fi pump &amp; running the engine while sitting
&gt; still, but I cannot recreate the leak. The only thing which seems common
&gt; to both leaks is a hard right turn before turning off the engine. I have
&gt; needed to pull the engine to fix some oil leaks but now it seems that I
&gt; will have to pull the tank as well just to get some piece of mind.
&gt; Anyone know what might cause such a leak?
