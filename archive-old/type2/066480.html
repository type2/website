Subject: Re: Non-Westfalia pop-tops

Don't forget about the Sportsmobile conversions out of Indiana.  Straight
pop with a double bed up above - lots of room to roll around!  I will
admit, however, that the remaining Sporty cabinets that came with my '73
were VERY cheesy....nothing beats the Westy cabinets and layout......but if
you pop in a Westy interior or build your own (soon as time allows!), you'd
have quite the practical camper!

&gt; Robert Taylor sez:
&gt; &gt;If there are any '71 ASI campers out there, they would be my 
&gt; &gt;candidate for &quot;the very best VW camper to own.*&quot; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Gentlefolk, start your encyclopedic memories! Does my 
&gt; &gt;dream bus exist?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Surfer Bob-
&gt; 
&gt; As a matter of fact, your dream bus does exist. ASI (actually, I thougt
&gt; it was AST) used to make an alternative to the Westfalia-brand pop-top
&gt; campers. They would by sunroof busses direct from VW, but without the
&gt; sunroof itself or any interior behind the cab. Then they would add their
&gt; own pop-top, folding bed, and cabinetry.
&gt; 
&gt; The ASI pop-tops are definitely more useful than the Westfalia
&gt; front-hinged ones. As you pointed out, the ASI tops go straight up,
&gt; rather than hinging from one end, and they have a double bed rather than
&gt; a single cot. One of their other advantages is that they cover the rear
&gt; section of the bus, not the front, allowing  a person to climb into the
&gt; upper bed without having to climb on the lower one, and preserving the
&gt; stand-up-to-put-on-your-pants headroom.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think the ASI cabinetry is as nice as the Wesfalia versions. I
&gt; also think that the ASI tops, for some unidentifiable reason, don't look
&gt; as cool as the Westfalia ones. I've considered finding an ASI pop-top in
&gt; a junk yard and installing it in place of my Westfalia top, but so far I
&gt; can't bring myself to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I think that ASI is still around. I think I've seen ASI
&gt; Vanagons and maybe even some ASI Toyota vans (the earlier ones, not the
&gt; Previas).

&gt; PS: Book chat: Here's my two cents on a couple books mentioned in
&gt; earlier posts: The People's Guide to Mexico, by Carl Franz and published
&gt; by Muir, is possible the best travel book ever published. It reads like
&gt; a novel, and contains both hilarious travel stories and genuinely useful
&gt; information that you'd never find anywhere else. He travels mostly by VW
&gt; bus, so there's a lot there for type-2ers.
&gt; Also, in the discussion of Grendel and mythology, someone mentioned a
&gt; book that tells the Beowulf story from the monster's point of view. It's
&gt; called &quot;Grendel&quot; and it's written by John Gardner. It's fantastic.
