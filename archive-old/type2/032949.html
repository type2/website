    I tried to post this message yesterday and I still haven't seen it,
so forgive me if it comes up twice. I am the proud but sometimes
frustrated owner of a 69 camper. It is my first bus, and it is a project
to say the least. The most recent issue that we are experiencing is a
noisy &quot;clacka-clacka-clacka&quot; when I travel in reverse. It will go away
when the clutch pedal is depressed and will quietly rattle or click in
neutral. The sound seems to be coming from the area of the differential.
Any ideas on what it is and how it can be fixed would be greatly
appreciated. Also, if anyone knows a good rust removal and/or conversion
product, I could use one (I know of sand paper and naval jelly).
Thanks,
Jeff
