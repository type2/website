&gt; West Coast Metric is right next to the 405 and 110. Pretty close.

That's where I ended up going and found.  Thanks for the head's up!  I 
wouldn't have thought of them if it wasn't for the list!!

And a big thanks to all the bus folk for being so damned cool.  My 
neighbor, also a fellow bus owner, let me borrow his Saturn to drive 
down to LA... that was really nice of him.  Of course I filled his tank 
and bought him a coupler for his bus, too ;)

Thanks,
Mike
