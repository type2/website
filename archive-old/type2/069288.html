&gt; &gt;       Jeff Carver is right- a fork-shaped tool would be MUCH better
&gt; &gt; for removing door inner pannels. I think I'll try to make one from
&gt; &gt; a thick-bladed putty knife next time I'm making tools...
&gt; 
&gt; I have always used a 1&quot; plastic (nylon??) putty knife to avoid paint
&gt; scratches. Cuting a slot in it might very well help.  One idea I have had
&gt; but not tried was to use a kitchen spatula.  The slot idea comes natural
&gt; to this if you cut the front of it back to the precast slots in many of
&gt; them and then sand a bevel back onto the front edge.

I have a question...I'm replacing the inner door panels on my 1972 
Panel and want to replace the plastic sheeting to protect the door 
panels...Rocky Mtn Motor Work's copies...from moisture damage. What would 
be the best type of glue/adhesive to use to afix the plastic sheeting to 
the (metal) door?

Suggestions or success stories welcome.
