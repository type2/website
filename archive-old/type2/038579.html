Subject: Re: Help! Stripped screws... 

Thanks to all who replied. I keep forgetting about those darn easy outs. I 
was just talking about them at work the other day, too. I got one loose, but 
the other one is being a pain. Have a parts bus, so I have eight extra screws 
(already have two out to replace the one).

Thanks again
