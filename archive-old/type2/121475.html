Subject: Re: [T2] replacing window (et al.) seals

Hi Harry,

Door seals are a pretty simple swap, it's just a matter of getting a 
good adhesive for the drivers and passenger door to hold the seal in 
place along the lower arch where the channel is not as deep.

The sunroof seal is another matter... It isn't supposed to be 
waterproof. The sunroof is DESIGNED to leak, and the water is supposed 
to drain away through tubes installed in the roof. The seal is only 
intended to keep leaves and other debris from getting past the steel 
roof and clogging the drains.

On my wife's bus the sunroof was very difficult to move, and of course 
the cables were broken. I have purchased replacement cables but will 
not install them until I have an opportunity to refurbish the aluminum 
rails the sunroof slides on, an clean up the metal tabs on the roof. Be 
careful with those cables, they're expensive as %^* and  are NLA  from 
VW.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hiya Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Been reading up on the various manuals, the sermons, and the mailing 
&gt; lists
&gt; trying to find some info on replacing standard seals.
&gt;
&gt; I've got a '79 transporter with front/real/sliding door/sliding roof 
&gt; seals all
&gt; shot. They all need to be replaced :-(
&gt;
&gt; I figured I should do this before attempting to follow the 
&gt; heating/soundproofing
&gt; of gmbulley.
&gt;
&gt; Short of the window seals is this a pretty easy job? I mean is it just 
&gt; a scape,
&gt; new adhesive, and then new rubber?
&gt;
&gt; Also, with the sliding roof... Has anyone opted out for a cheaper 
&gt; alternative
&gt; than the cost of the VW seal (~$179.00). I want to still be able to 
&gt; open/close
&gt; the window. I was thinking about felt weatherstriping and applying 
&gt; some adhisive...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Harry
