&quot;Close Encounter with A Chronically Loose Axle Nut&quot; 

My experience is that the hub wears down and not the spacer. I had the right
side of the '69 always come loose after a period of time no matter how hard
I slammed the nut down (I even stripped a nut once!) eventually I noticed
that the inside face on the hub had worn down &gt;1/8&quot;. I'm sure this is caused
by the splines being worn on either the hub or axle shaft allowing some
play. No matter how often or tight you crank the nut you will eventually
have to replace the worn part and the drum will be shot to boot.
