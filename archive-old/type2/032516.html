 -Every once in a while I post a plea to anyone holding a copy of the
 -'Locally made tools' book published by VW for their dealers.


Simon
Even though I have made a load of tools to do various jobs on the bus, I
too would be most interested in this publication, provided the source was 

legal and didn't breach any copyrights. I have built tools to do the
following: remove/fit th
 flywheel gland bolt/hub nut, gearbox drain/fill plug spanner, generator
locking tool, ball joint pressing tools and a variety of modified
sockets, spanners and allen keys to to various tasks. The book would give 

other ideas for tools that  could make myself.
