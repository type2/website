Hello Type 2 Listers:

Thanks again to all who suggested that the pushrod tube seals were the 
likely sources (a major source, anyway) for my leaky '76 Campmobile.  Just 
think, 8 places for oil to escape!  The engine has only 20k on a rebuild and 
runs pretty well, otherwise.

New seals were installed and I picked up the Bus from the VW garage today, 
the same day.  I immediately took it to the spray wash. A healthy 
application of Simple Green and then soap and water cleaned things off 
nicely underneath.  So far, after logging a few miles, the cardboard I 
placed under the engine is clean.  Before the procedure you could watch the 
oil drip.  I'm now cautiously optimistic that most of the flow has been 
eliminated.

Your help is much appreciated.

Walt Fogle
