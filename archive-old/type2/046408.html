You can have the image and the niceties with a little work - it's all been done before.  Air conditioning, more power, cruise control, heat, power windows - everything except the airbag, and that's possible too if you're really, really good.  Some will say that you're no longer driving a bus.  I prefer to think of it as the best of both worlds.
