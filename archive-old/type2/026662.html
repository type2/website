Hi,

There's been a thread about beefing up and adding more interior heat
recently.  Considering the weather, it's not to hard to see why.  But here
in So. Cal., most of the year I'm too hot.  I noticed in my Bentley manual
71 electrical schematics that there are dash mounted fresh air ventilation
fans.  My Westy doesn't have em and I haven't seen em on any other 71.  My
71 super beetle had em though.  If this was an option, I'd love to find some
and install them in my dash.  Any 71 Westy owners have these?  Anyone know
anything about it, like where I might be able to score some?

Thanks,

Alan
