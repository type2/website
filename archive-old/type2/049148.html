Subject: [T2] Hello everyone...This is long, but please bare with the newbie.

    My name is Claud.  Let me start by saying that I'm really glad to have 
found this list.  It's like having a council of elders.  
    Here is the situation:  Since before I could drive, I've wanted a 
Volkswagen.  I'm now 21 and the dream finally came true about two months ago 
when I bought a '68 bus for $800.  It's in good shape mechanically, and I put 
about 80-100 miles on it a week.  I knew there was a lot of rust (road salt) 
and poor Bondo work on it when I bought it, but the price was too good for me 
to pass up.  After all, it's a westy!  Or so I thought.  It's registered as a 
69, but the chassis # and the door handles say it's a '68.  &quot;Cool,&quot; I 
thought...&quot;first year of the breadloaf westy......hey...wait a minute...the 
Westfalia plate on the bed is stamped 1969...and it has no pop-top.&quot;  Does 
this mean it's not a real westy?  
    Only to add more confusion, I'm getting flack from Mom and Dad.  Like I 
said, it has rust.  The cab floor needs to be replaced.  So does half of the 
back floor.  I got an estament...$400 dollar for labor alone.  &quot;No problem,&quot; 
I thought, &quot;I'll take a welding class and an autobody class next semester at 
the college.  Money saved and knowledge gained.  The flack?  Mom and Dad say, 
&quot;Don't put any money into that thing...you'll never get it back!&quot;  If I do 
all the work, it only needs about $1500...$2000 tops (and I think that's a 
stretch).  Add to this what I paid for it, and the total is $2800.  Will I 
have trouble getting that back?  To tell the truth, I don't plan on ever 
selling it, I just want to appease the 'rents.

Sorry for the length.  Thanks in advance.

BTW, when replying to the list, should I reply to all or just reply to the 
sender of the messege?
