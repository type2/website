Subject: RE: [T2] BOTTOM TIN

As long as there is one on the other side you could be missing one if not 
you are missing two =D!

Note R and W on the diagram. They should be there to help cool and stop road 
debris from causing your push rod tubes and associated pieces there from 
getting FUBARed.

&gt;From: &quot;DARREN&quot; I have a 72 van, it appears to be missing a piece of tin
&gt;at the bottom of the engine that would cover up the pushrod tubes. Can
&gt;anyone confirm that i am indeed missing a piece?
