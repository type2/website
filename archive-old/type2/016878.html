Subject: really really cold accelerator cable

&gt;
&gt; it's been really cold here lately.  I know I've whined a little already but it's true!
&gt; here's my latest problem, at -14 to 0* F the throttle has been taking 3-5 seconds to return, makes driving a little exciting sometimes.  I 
think the grease in
&gt; thanks

Hi Oly...et al.   Had the same problem in a 66 beetle 1300 when I lived 
on the farm 25
miles out of Dawson Creek BC in the early 80's. Winter temps got to -40 
(C/F doesn't
matter, they're the same) often for weeks at a time, sometimes as low as 
-54!  Here's
how I solved it.

Step #1...tie a piece of old baler twine to the verticle stud UNDER the 
gas pedal (you
can't tie it to the pedal itself because, well...read on.

Step #2...tie the other end of the baler twine on to the nerve handle in 
front of the
passenger seat.

Step #3...after a looooong warm up period, place in appropriate gear, let 
out
clutch depressing the gas pedal until appropriate speed is achieved

Step #4...step on clutch and pull twine AT THE SAME TIME (this takes 
practice
especially when wearing thick mittens!)

Step #5...shift...goto step 3

True story, I swear....drove it for months like that every winter.  This 
only works until you can get a replacement cable and some special 
lubricant that doesn't gel at those temps.  Go to a commercial 
construction company for info on its name, I don't need it anymore, its 
much warmer way down here in southern BC.
