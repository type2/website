Andrew,

Check out Miller Fuel Injection.  They are at
http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com

Gary has ALOT of experience with the Bosch CIS system and adapting them to type
I motors.  He has an enormous amount of information on his site about fitting
CIS to early busses and other engines.  The only vehicle that there is a
problem in fitting are bugs as the engine compartment does not have the room.

I have pulled a CIS system from a 2.2 L volvo and am in the process of adapting
it to work with the type IV motor that I'm putting into my truck.  Pictures of
that are at:

Good luck

Scott
