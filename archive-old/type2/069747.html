Dave,
FWIW here are the parts I replaced on my van ('72 Camper, non-pop top)

their original fit, and their condition now.

** In all fairness, Bill told me the quality of the Brazilian seals 
   were inferior. I opted to go with the cheaper for the pass. side 
   thinking there would be less use on that side. Saved me 60% *initially*.

Front turn      Bus Boys        good                    Poor. Cracked and
lense seals     (Sorry Jim!)                            leaking, have been 
                                                        for over a year.
                                                        Purchased 4/22/93.

Front turn      Daniel's VW     new OEM Hella.          Excellent. $55_at_, 
lenses          Parts &amp; Acces.  ('nuff said)            they otta be! for 
                                                        a '72, tho...hard
                                                        to find...

All the grommets and seals on the engine tin, the timing indicator, screen
for the fan, tube for the alternator etc. etc. etc., the stuff nobody else 
carries for the engine compartment I got from Checkered Flag Mazda/Volkswagen.
All OEM. Fit was perfect, and it is all still in excellent condition.
Incidentally, I just bought 5 new cabinet handles (minus the push buttons)
for the Westy from the local dealer. Been looking at swap meets, etc. for a 
while. The ones I saw were unrealistically priced ($5 and up for poor
condition). The dealer got 'em for me in three days. The price? $3.15_at_.

The moral? Don't be afraid to check you local dealer; you might be suprised
at the prices and what they can get. Check two if one is reluctant to help
you (maybe they don't have the fisches any more). Buy OEM when you can, 
German is usually best if it's not. One company may have some stuff that's
good and some that's total crap (the front window seals and felt from WCM,
for example). Don't get in a hurry, check the stuff out before you install
it. Order it way before you're ready to install it so you have time to send
it back if you don't like it, and order everything with a major credit card. 

I have no affiliation with any of the above mentioned companies, with the
exception of being a customer. 
Customer service? As expected for all with the exception of Daniel's, which
was above average. He actually had to find one of the turn lenses for me.
Both new.

My $.02, FWIW.
