&gt; &gt; This sounds like
&gt; &gt; an issue that will typically be resolved by just adequate maintenance
&gt; &gt; inspection. Rule that out before any further diagnosis.
&gt;  I keep her maintained as well as I know how. But
&gt;this does bring up another question for a newbie like me. How often should
&gt;cap and rotor be replaced? (As often as they need it ).

Absolutely, by inspection, not time or mileage. Replace only when wear or 
defects are observed, not before, not after. Typical replacement occurs 
upon erosion of the contacts beyond 0.2mm from new. Same with the rotor and 
plugs.

For complete maintenance info, see the Bentley Maintenance section. 
Everywhere it gives time or mileage, insert &quot;by inspection&quot;.
