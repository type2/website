Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plug Blow out+ACEAIQAh-

Chad,

Never had this actually happen so others may have more insight, but to
*really* know, I would pull the engine and find out.

68 bus = easy engine pull.  Take the head off and see what happened!

Let us know too!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello fellow List members,
&gt;      Hope all had a great weekend. I had a great time at the dead of winter
snip
&gt; exhaust. I pulled into a driveway and got pointed down hill as I shut her
&gt; down. Looking around the engine compartment I notice the spark plug wire
&gt; hanging out at the +ACM-1 cylinder. I felt the plug and it came right out in my
&gt; hand. Using a CD case as a mirror I saw the threads were chewed to bits and
&gt; a nice gash to match the one on my spark plug. The rest of the story ends
&gt; with a trip to find a heli (not sure of the spelling) coil and the tools to
&gt; install it with. I got weird looks at the autozone and other little part
&gt; store in the area. I ended up renting a Uhaul to my baby home. Now heres my
&gt; questions. 1. What caused this type thing to happen? 2. What other damage
&gt; could come from this? 3. Whats the best fix now that she is home in the
&gt; drive way?
