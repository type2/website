Subject: Oil pump blue printing question

Unless you 78 has an after market pump I think you'll find you have the
same thing.
I have seen some after market pumps that look much like the type 1 pump
but I am not
sure of the quality. Thinking about getting one from CB Performance but
can't find
anyone who has tried one to give them a reference (good or bad).
