Subject: 1979 Air Conditioning

I have a 1979 Deluxe Campmobile and am considering removing the air
conditioning.  The blower works and I think if it was recharged, it might a
functioning unit.

I am not a fan of air conditioning (we never use it on our '87 Westy) and it
seems that if it is just dead weight, it should be removed.  My questions
are this:

Would it ruin the &quot;stock&quot; appeal of a bus that is in very good shape?

Is there an aftermarket for used VW air conditioning units?

Thanks for any feedback.
