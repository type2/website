Hiya Phil,

No, do not try that site!

Truth is that (despite what it says at the bottom concerning copyrights. etc) 
this site has NOT been authorized by Bob Hoover.  In short, it is a rip-off.  
Inasmuch as it is unethical and illegal to steal somebody's property I would 
suggest that any Listee not be a &quot;party&quot; to this website.

Besides, if you contact Mr. Hoover he will tell you that his Sermons are 
accessible.  Right here in the Type 2 Archives.

Mike
