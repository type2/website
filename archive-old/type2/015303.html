&gt;Once again someone is attempting to give the impression that there is
&gt;something inherently superior about German engineering and design. 

What is the most successful automobile ever produced in the history
of mankind. Das Volkswagon Type I. Why???? RESULTS, best suited to
the long term needs for economical, efficient transport. The bearings
for a 1955 356C are the same part number as a 1989 911. DM says, if
you haven't got the time to do it right the first time, when will you
find the time to do it over???? I learned this element of the DM while
practicing in the American engineering industry.

The highest state of Engineering in America is arguably NASA. Upon which
Methode
is superior rocket science founded??????? Was ist der namen uff der
Doktors vat dit dis?????

It
&gt;has no basis in fact. 

Many are highly indoctrined these days in acceptance of facade in lue of fact.

German engineering is no better than that from
&gt;many other nations. 

I agree. Many nations have adopted the Methode. The Swiss, the Danes, the
Belgians,
and the Swedes immediatly come to mind. The French stole the Methode as war
reparations
in the abduction of Herr Doktor Porsche and his Son and used them without
compensation
to establish from scratch renewed post war industry. They let his Son out
who immediatly
created a new Formula 1 vehicle and with the proceeds paid the French
ransom on his
Father so he could come home and see Porsche Chassis No. 1 months before
his premature
death due to the debilitating nature of prison confinement.

There is no automotive manufacturer in the world today that has not paid
license fees 
to Porsche Design for designs that can't be beat. Yes, even the Japanese,
who have some
very non Western ideas about patent rights, hire Porsche Design to solve
best the
problems their method can't. And don't you know, the consultants who work
in Japan
have learned much production and management while there and augmented their
Methode
with perceived opportunities for improvement. For a foundating principle of
the DM
is continuous improvement through bright ideas from all and children.
Inspiration is
where you find it. You must be constantly looking to find it.

If German engineering were so good, there would be
&gt;no recalls on German products.

Superior does not mean perfect.
Nobody is perfect, or hadn't you heard. The Methode gets as close to
perfection
as we've come so far and is limited only by it's current state of progression
in that direction. Just 'cause perfection is unobtainable by definition to
a human
being doesn't mean it is off the list when it comes to goals. How do you
know how
far you can go if your goal is limited???? The biggest limitation is the
ability 
of the individual to adhere to an abscense of compromise to the Methode.

 As for following manufacturer's
&gt;maintenence recommendations, that should always be done regardless of
&gt;the make of the vehicle.

I wholeheartaly agree. Even when I service a relative's Ford truck, I buy
FOMOCO parts and follow their manual as a guide in applying the Methode.
If those FOMOCO belts lasted 6 years and 60,000 miles you would be penny
smart and pound foolish to put on Gates wannabes.

Thank you for the feedback.
