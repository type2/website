Hi Volks,

It's an exhaust valve for a 1.8L carbed head. The catch is that I 
require delivery by Friday.

The reason I need it can be seen here:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/E-Valve2.jpg ...I removed this from 
the bus on Monday night.

This Saturday I need/want  to get an engine into Bob the Tomato. This 
is critical if I am going to be able to attend the June Jitterbug in a 
suitable vehicle.

Plan A. is to put up a recently acquired 2L engine. It needs a pair of 
2L heads I sent out to a local machine shop to have the valves done and 
some studs pulled. Problem there is that I'm not 100% sure they will be 
ready in time.  After the 2L is installed in &quot;Bob The Tomato&quot; his 1.8L 
will be converted to FI and installed in Dad's 75 Westy &quot;Franklin&quot;.

Plan B. is that I repair the busted valve on the 1.8L engine, and put 
it back up &quot;temporarily&quot; until the 2L is ready. Which is why I need the 
valve. The seat is OK, so with a little lapping compound I'm sure I can 
get back on the road in good time.

Thanks for your assistance!


Happy trails,
