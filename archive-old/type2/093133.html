Subject: Re: [T2] CV problem


&gt;How does one break a CV joint??

I broke TWO in the same 5 miles by breaking the cage inside. This was on an 
'84 Rabbit 'vert that I owned in Italy. Same CV joint design as the bus. It 
had 185K miles on the original CV's. Was leaving a friend's car shop when 
one broke. I was able to limp back to his shop (100 yards) with the joint 
creaking, snapping, etc. He replaced it and on the way down the same 
stretch of road the other side popped. Both times it was the outboard CV. 
Both cases he made zero money - I just paid for the parts so I know it 
wasn't him &quot;milking me&quot;. He wasn't the type of person to do that anyhow. He 
was doing me a favor. We used parts from the local salvage yard so it was 
CHEAP to fix.

Rough road, 15 mph, 1st gear.

Bad luck or engineered failure (tolerances that said 185.5 miles is the max 
CV life)... &lt;grin!&gt;
