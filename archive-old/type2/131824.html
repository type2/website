Subject: RE: [T2] what happened? broke down

&gt;From: ChaMoon

&gt;anyone got a idea i am game for it...
&gt;right now... i am down in the dumps and once more my brand new engine has 
&gt;left me high and dry...~!~
&gt;i dont know where to start besides the battery... and then????????hmmmmm
&gt;thanks for any or all advice ...
&gt;i am so tired i think i will start later..
&gt;we didnt get in till really bad late last night....2 ish...


Sorry to hear about your misfortune. I knew those 1000W Sodium Halide lights 
in the cabinet might draw down the battery ;).

Check your battery.
Check the Alternator, per Bentley, I don't have mine here or I would give 
you the process.
Check your plugs they may have fouled with the lack of energy to fire 
properly.

I suspect it is your Alternator.

This sounds like what happened to me once while I was driving to DC in my 
'69 Square Back. Popping, bad idle, shooting blank shotgun shells from the 
tail pipe, lights dying out, after it ended no click to the starter at all, 
dead.
I replaced the Generator and problem was solved, still a little rough so I 
pulled the plugs and they awful, replaced those and it was all peaches and 
cream.

Good Luck,
