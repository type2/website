Subject: Re: Fuel Tank filter screen
Message-Id: &lt;v03110710b32723ef2eb9_at_[24.92.77.230]&gt;

&gt;I wanted to remove the Fuel Tank filter screen and see how much crap was in
&gt;it, does anyone have a picture/diagram/description I could use, I can't seem
&gt;to find it in any of my books

It comes out with that fitting on the bottom of the tank. It's a long worm
made of mesh. The mesh is about like that net you use to catch the goldfish
out of the tank but it's made of some indestructible material. Just wiggle
it out of there.

You're the guy who can't quite get enough gas to keep running, right? I
think you're on the right track. Tanks get all sorts of sludge in them. One
time Joe Fournier had a tank that kept giving him trouble and when he
finally sloshed it all sorts of stuff came out, organic and otherwise,
including a dessicated mouse (yes!). I think that tank took two sloshings
to get right.

My last one I sloshed out hard with water and detergent, then again with a
half gallon of isopropyl alcohol to rinse the water off. You can coat the
insides with sloshing compound and whatnot, some people swear by it, I
don't care to spend the money, you choose your way.
