Sounds like a garden variety 32/36 DFEV. These come in several 
flavors. They were first used on the venerable Ford Pinto. Most of 
the ones on buses are Weber brand and some are Holley brand that was 
a licensed version of the Weber. It is a compromise carb that many 
buses with type 4 motors have as a replacement for original dual 
carbs or fuel injection. They work ok, there have been lots of fights 
on the list about how suitable they are and how to tune them with the 
009  dizzy you likely have.  I will report that I have about 40,000 
on the Weber 009 setup and it works fine. Other will disagree.

&gt;it is a single carb. w/ two square openings under the filter (which 
&gt;is also square and rests on top of the carb.)
&gt;
&gt;it doesn't look like any of the carbs. in my bentley manual or the 
&gt;one illustrated in Muir's book.
