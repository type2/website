Subject: Re: shifters?

&gt;If the Type2 web page is up, there is some info on the bushings and
&gt;shifter on the site on a tech page.

This can be found at http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm  
Consider upgrading to a rebuilt 091 nosecone (Weddle and Transform sell these).

More information on the Berg and Scat aftermarket shifters can be found in
the archives at http://vw.i405_dot_com/ 

Here's what I recall from threads past on this topic: the Berg shifter is of
better quality and a bit more expensive; some aftermarket shifter handles
obstruct the e-brake handle (however, this may only occur when they are used
in conjunction with the optional locking base); the additional weight of an
aftermarket shifter could be a factor in premature transmission component
wear.  As Scott pointed out, the shorter throw can be a bonus over the stock
shifter.
