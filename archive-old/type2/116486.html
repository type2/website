Subject: type2parts_dot_com/old volks_dot_com BC hours

  This is to let those that care that type2parts/oldvolks_dot_com will be on
special hours from June 18th through June 24.
  Orders may be placed by phone between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm (pst) on
these days. There will be no technical assistance available during these
dates. Orders on-line will still be shipped UNLESS there are OFS items, in
which case orders will ship on or around the 27th of June.

  Thank you to all

ps. One of my objectives of going to Bad Camberg (Germany) is to meet with a
couple manufacturers (lens and rubber I currently purchase from) and two of
Europe's biggest VW parts suppliers. With any luck I will add a lot of NEW
original German and Danish made parts to my line of items.)
