Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp guage report

Hi Tom,

Get a 51mm hole saw and drill the dash below the radio. The end result 
looks stock!

It takes some moxy to put a drill to a perfectly good dash, but the end 
results were worth it. Measure several times before you punch the pilot 
holes.

Happy trails,

&gt; the dash that is enclosed so you don't see the wires and connectors on

&gt; back of the guage?
