Subject: Re: [T2] swivel feet valve adjusters

&gt;Others seem to have a foot that swivels on a ball attached to the adjuster.
I've no experience with those, but I'll bet that they are easier to adjust.
&lt;

They are junk!  Mine broke in less than 1,000 miles.  They wore right
through the foot.  Really pitiful product all around.  Wish I had a digital
camera to post pictures, I kept them for posterity sake.

The swivel ball adjusters work in T1 engines very well, but unless you have
a dial indicator and a stack of different size shims handy to calculate the
correct lift I would stay stock.  Most people slap these on and screw up the
rocker geometry...  No the shims that come with the kit do not do the trick.

The best solution is the Porsche 911 adjusters, but again they require lots
of precision work to setup correctly as well.  Also these can get pricey.
On T4 motors the rockers need ground down a little bit so it is a fairly
large endeavor.

I personally stay stock and replace the adjusters when they start to
&quot;flatten&quot; at the tip.  Cheap and easy.  Also it is good to adjust your
valves every 3,000-5,000 just to see that the heads are not getting to hot
and stretching the exhaust valves (something you hydro guys can only guess
about).  The most important thing as well is that the stock adjusters are
lighter and will offer better performance in the long run due to less
reciprocating mass, someone mentioned this before as well.
