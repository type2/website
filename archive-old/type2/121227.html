Subject: Re: [VB] Long shot-anyone have Allstate trailer brackets or
  bumper clamps?

A local VW guy here in Fresno put an advertisement out on a free radio 
station asking for one-wheel trailers. He got leads on 3-4, some were 
free. Might pay to put an ad in a wanted classified and find someone who 
wants to clear out junk.
