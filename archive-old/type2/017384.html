Being another New Jersey resident, I can heartily second Michael's
advice, but it is nevertheless a real PITA.  I have been under the
impression for some time that NJ was the *only* state left with this
archaic law.  When we travel, it's such a pleasure to use the
self-service stations across the country, particularly those with the
pumps that take credit cards.

Michael, if one of these days either of us winds up with a brutalized
rubber filler elbow, and is obliged to undertake its repair, perhaps
that will give us an opportunity to invent something more durable.

What I've been wondering is why do we have these laws?  I know that here
in New Jersey, merchants with gas pumps have a heck of a time finding
employees to work as pump attendants, so you'd think they'd welcome
self-service.  About the only reason I can think of that they (yeah, the
gas station operators' lobby is what controls these things) would
continue to resist self-service is that it'd lead to an eventual outlay
of new equipment.  But, heck, most of the individual proprietorships are
being swallowed up by the oil companies with their new facilities
anyhow.
