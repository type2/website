Re: [T2] RE: Welders
&gt;  
&gt;  I got a Lincoln Weld-Pak 100 and I took it to my welding class at the 
local 
&gt;  high school to learn on and I could weld 1/4&quot; steel plate no problem. It 
&gt;  should be no problem to weld sheet metal on buses.


Isn't the problem the other way 'round? I'm certain that a 250 Amp buzz box 
would weld 1/4&quot; palte, but I wouldn't want to use it on body panels. The 
trouble with bottom-end wire welders is twofold: They don't turn down enough 
nor in sufficient increments, and they don't have the gas to gracefully weld 
the thin stuff unless you are an EXPERT!!! (many have gas as an extra $$ 
option, fixing the last complaint).

The welder that JCWitney sells has more heat selections than most, I think 6 
instead of 4. An expert body welder told me that the two extra heat steps 
alone make that one more than worth the little bit extra$$ over the cheapest 
ones.
