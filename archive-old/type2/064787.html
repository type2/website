Hmm... good point. I wouldn't think this would be the case. I've been 
told that 30 weight transfers heat better than MV oils. I suppose that's 
why VW held for years w/ their recommendation of using it in their 
air-cooled cars, long after &quot;everyone&quot; had gone to the new hi-tech oils.

To properly test this, numerous engines would need to be bench tested 
under varying loads and outside temps. In a vehicle, changes in the 
environment and driving style could void the validity of the data.

Still... if true... this could be something to try out in a new engine. 
I've learned my lessons on changing oil brands/types in older engines. I 
used to run Valvoline. It's a great oil, and does a great job of 
cleaning up the inside of an engine. Unfortunately, this frequently 
caused dozens of new leaks to spring into being. If the PO is running a 
decent brand/grade of oil, I wouldn't change mid-stream.
