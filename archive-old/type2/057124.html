Howdy everyone.  We've had quite a few requests for info on how to recover
your seats.  Here it is:

To restore your seat covers you will need:

a sewing machine

upholstery thread

2 yards of upholstery fabric

a seam ripper

sewing or sharp scissors

a large box of ball head pins or flat pins and a thimble

2 24 in. x 24 in. pieces of 1 in. thick foam rubber.  Select a comfortable
grade.  We chose the &quot;ultra&quot; because it gave more support and looked like it
would be more durable.

corrugated cardboard

duct tape

a piece of tailor^Rs or regular chalk

First, select the seat with the most intact upholstery and remove the
headrest.
We used a large flathead screwdriver and wrenched out the bobby-pins holding
the
headrest on the mounts.  After the pins are out, pull the headrest upward to
remove.  Remove the seat (see the Bentley manual on seat removal sections
72.2-
72.6. If you don^Rt have the manual, we will gladly copy it and send it to
you)
and take it to a location where you can make a huge mess. Separate the top
half
from the bottom.  This is achieved by removing the 8mm hex nuts on the side
of
the seats that are located under the plastic housing.  Depending on the year
of
your bus the instructions for seat separation may be different, again see
Bentley.

 Once the seat is in pieces, removing the former upholstery is pretty
straightforward.  Although you may be tempted to rip it off and burn it, you
need to be pretty careful in removing it because you need the old upholstery
to
create a pattern.  Beginning with the seat back, turn it upside down and
examine
where the upholstery comes together on the bottom.  There will be four black
or
rusted metal barbs that are holding the upholstery together.  Carefully bend
these straight up.  This will allow you to pull off 2 layers of wire covered
with fabric.  This sounds difficult but when you actually see it, you will
undoubtedly find it simple.  Once both wires are removed from the barbs,
remove
them from the upholstery and save them.  Now you can pull the seat cover off
by
working it toward the headrest mounts.  When you reach the headrest mounts
gently work the fabric over the plastic.

 If it looks like someone dumped a few pounds of pencil sharpener shavings
into your seat back, you are on the right track.  This is horsehair from the
former batting.  We worked on an old sheet and cleaned the springs carefully
and
immediately discarded the resulting mess.  You should now have one very sad
looking seat cover and equally sad looking metal seat back frame.  Turn the
seat
cover inside out to expose the seams.  If you look carefully you will see
three
layers; the upholstery cloth (or what is left of it), the attractive
pleather
backing, and a sandwiched layer of plastic piping.  The object here is to
carefully remove the fabric from the piping so that you can create a pattern
from it.  We left the rest of the thread connecting the piping to the
pleather
as intact as possible to make it easier to sew later.  Although it is
possible
to sew a new pleather backing, if it is in good shape it is wiser to leave
it
alone and reuse it.

 Using the seam ripper turn the fabric-side up and pick at the seams
holding it to the piping.  The fabric should separate easily.  Once the
fabric
is removed, pick out the other seam on the bottom that held the wire in
place.
Use an iron to flatten the fabric completely.  If this piece is in good
condition, lay it on the new upholstery fabric and trace around it with the
chalk.  Make another tracing for the other seat back.  If the fabric is a
mess,
use newspaper or confil to create a pattern.  Lay the fabric on the paper
and
trace around it.  If there are large pieces missing, try to project the
shape
from what you have.  Remember that the piece is symmetrical.  As long as you
have one good side, you can recreate the whole.  Cut the fabric and pin it
to
the pleather and piping, the wrong sides of both the fabric and the pleather
should be facing out.   We pinned every 1 to 1 1/2 inches, except around
corners
where the pins need to be closer.  Before sewing, turn the pinned piece
inside
out and inspect it visually to make sure it looks the way you want it to
look.

 When you begin sewing, begin stitching with a running stitch about 1/2 in
from the edge...exactly as the former piece was stitched.  When the fabric
meets
the plastic piping this becomes easier because the needle will begin to run
along the side of the piping.  Sew through the flat part of the piping as
close
to the &quot;pipe&quot; as possible but not through the pipe itself.  After you have
sewn
a few inches, you may wish to remove the pins from where you have sewn to
inspect it.  There should be pleather on one side and fabric on the other
with
the piping sticking out perfectly in between.  After the perimeter is sewn,
remove the pins, turn it inside out and marvel at the beauty of your work.
Fold
the fabric on the bottom over by 1/2 inch and sew a seam for the metal wire
to
live in.

 Next, you need to prepare the seat back for the cover.  This is the part
where a partner comes in handy.   If two people are working, one can prepare
the
seat back frame while the other is sewing.  You might want to clean out all
of
the little bits and wipe the metal so that the duct tape stays put.  We
followed
the directions posted by Lee Wood (use list search to find posting by him
under
the subject &quot;Re: SewFine Seat Covers for ^R81 Vanagon&quot; on Sept 21st 1995 -
thanks, Lee).  Read lines 71-90.  Basically you cover the springs with a
layer
of cardboard and duct tape (no exact science here), and lay the foam on top
of
it and wrap it around the frame tucking it in anywhere you can.  We used
duct
tape to ensure that the foam was securely attached before reinstalling the
cover.

 When the backing is finished, pull the cover back on until it fits
correctly.  You will need to cut two small &quot;X&quot; shapes into the fabric over
the
headrest holes.  Do this by inserting a sharp pair of scissors into the
holes
and using it as the center of the X.  Work the fabric over and around the
holes
and tuck the loose ends in.  This should provide enough slack to allow you
to
pull the bottom together.

 At this point you should put the two wires back into their housing and
pull them back over the barbs in reverse order of removal.  Push the barbs
back
down and the back is finished!

 Now for the bottom cover.  Turn the seat over and remove the hardware as
per the Bentley manual.  If you stand on the metal bottom it makes it easy
to
remove the cover. This is very different from the top; here the fabric is
backed
by small strips of cardboard and pushed into a track. It should be easy to
pull
the fabric out of the metal track around the bottom.  Once the cardboard is
removed from the track, peel the seat cover off and leave any remaining
white
batting stuck to the foam.  As before, carefully rip the seams binding the
fabric to the pleather and piping.  When the fabric is separated, rip out
the
two remaining seams on the sides.  Carefully remove the strip of cardboard
on
the fabric and save it to sew on the new piece.  As before, iron the old
fabric
and trace 2 copies in your new fabric.  Before you pin it to the pleather,
sew
the side seams exactly as they were sewn on the old cover (we used the old
cover
as a reference).  Clean any sticky adhesive or batting off of the pleather
otherwise it will be very difficult to sew.  Pin the new cover to the
pleather,
following the directions above for the seat back.  The last thing you should
do
is sew the cardboard strip onto the new fabric.  Do this slowly and it will
work
like a charm.

 Replace the seat cover in the same manner that you removed it.  Replace
the hardware and put the seat back together.  Good luck!  We hope you are as
pleased with the results as we were.  If you have any questions or if you
need
any other assistance, please let us know.

Happy trails!
