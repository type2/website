I just completed putting a new engine in my 1971 Bus with the early
transmission and on the road test I can not do over 35 mph.  I have adjusted
the wing nut on the clutch cable and now have run out of room to adjust it
anymore.  The pedal has about an inch and a half of play before I feel
pressure.  Bentley Book says that I should only have about 3/8-3/4 in.
freeplay.  Could this be my problem??  I do smell that wicked clutch smell
after driving so I do know that it is slipping.  I have not checked the sag in
the flexible guide tube yet but the clutch was fine when the old motor was in
so I really do not think that is it.  All of the clutch is new so I do not
suspect any of those parts unless I goofed on installing something.  I went by
the instructions in three different books so I think that there is a good
chance that I got it right.   I am second guessing myself at this point.  The
new motor sounds great but the Bus will not go.
