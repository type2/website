&gt; YesterdaY I decided to pull the plenum and check it for cracks. I got
&gt; as far as the intake runners, and discovered that the bolts were not
&gt; fully tightened. Too tight to turn by hand, but no real resistance to
&gt; my quarter inch ratchet. So I figured it would be better to just
&gt; tighten down the runners properly and see if that would help.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem solved. Vacuum is immediately 14&quot; and rises a bit as the bus
&gt; warms. Driveable immediately without balking.

I find those running and more often the intake manifold nuts for the dual
carbs require a drop of loctite on them to keep them in place.
