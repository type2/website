Subject: question gas motor that sounds like a diesel

Recently I've noticed that my 1700fi type 4 is not sounding the same.

I'm trying to recall if there was an event that I noticed it more obviously
and I might be tempted to say it started around the time electronic
ignition was stuck in. I had the VW mechanic do it since he's done
many and has been fixin for years and years and ye....

I thought it might be the exhaust and there is some leakage but
I don't think it would make it sound like a diesel motor.
Is there anything  anyone is aware of problem wise or .. that
could cause this?

I've got great power, no hesitation, zoom zoom and all.
Should I worry about it?

I don't know if this might be related to my 'maybe bad camshaft
bearing' thing.  Im checking the service hole this weekend with the
oilchange to see if the bearing shifts any.

Ideas?

James
