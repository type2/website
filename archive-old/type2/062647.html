Subject: Part # for Brake Pedal Pan Screws Revealed

Hi folks,

After searching local hardware stores for the right size coarse thread hex
head screw that holds the pan that covers the front pedal assemblies on
baywindow buses, I finally broke down and bought them from the dealer (_at_ 60
cents each!).  For those interested, the part # is N 013 890 5
Keep your pans on!
