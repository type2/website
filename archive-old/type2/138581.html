Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster Replacement

I agree.

New ones aren't very expensive and you will already be under the bus doing 
the booster, might as well do it right and replace master too. Just will  
need a helper to bleed brakes.

Last weekend I noticed there was fluid in my failed booster but I'm not 
certain it's brake fluid from a faulty master, it could be fuel mixture that 
came from manifold because there was not a 1 way check valve on the line. I 
know with my other failed booster on my other 71 it was definately fuel 
because you could smell it.

The diaphram can colapse from old age, but seems more likely either 
brake/fuel got in and weakened it.

&gt;I would make sure that the master cyl is not bad, most
&gt;of the time the brake booster goes bad from a leaking
&gt;master cyl. Phil
