Subject: Re: [T2] How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

&gt; I have a 1978 Westy deluxe that was missing the sink / stove cabinet
&gt; when I purchased it. I found a new cabinet in good shape and want to
&gt; install it. I see a long red wire with a push on connector, and a short brown
&gt; wire with push on connector (I take it to be ground ?).
&gt; 
&gt; Just to make it more confusing, the long red wire is connected
&gt; in the middle to a 4-way small square black connector.
&gt; in the bottom is one red wire, other red long wire with push
&gt; on connector out the bottom. Out the top are two 6&quot; black
&gt; wires that today are not connected to anything ??
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone advise me on how to wire this up ? Is there
&gt; some documentation on the site I have missed ?

I recently documented the wiring for the sink following it from the front
carpet to the faucet to the pump:
