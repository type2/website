Subject: Re: [T2] which carb to use.

E-mail message   
 
 --A logical perception, but dooms the trade to fail :) Engine longevity
may suffer from carbs washing the pistons with excess fuel.---

The chokes were mentoned here as the culprit of excessive fuel wash,
which is true--but not totally.
Proper float settings, needle and se condition, jetting, is the prime
factor in excessive fuel consumption.  

-- Those carbs are just plain dangerous -- 

The carbs aren't dangerous--it's the fool who's &quot;dialing&quot; them in who's
causing them to to be dangerous.

Carbs are actually pretty simple, if you know what your doing.
Short cutiing the job with using more worn out parts that may look good,
is usually the biggest problem.

The simplest solution to a worn out piece of junk, and the most cost and
aggravation peventitive measure is just bite the bullet and buy new
units--
It'll save thousands in the long run--just in time and frustration.

I've found this to be pretty true with just abot anything---throw the
crap out--and replace it with the proper new unit-and you'll enjoy miles
of trouble free motoring.

Later,
