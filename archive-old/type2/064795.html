&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;I've got a problem with my '74 1800 camper which I think is related to the
&gt;gear shift linkage. When using the engine to slow down in second gear, eg.
&gt;slowing down for a sharp corner, sometimes there's a loud vibrating noise
&gt;which seems to eminate from underneath the cargo bay floor, and which I
&gt;can be felt through the gear stick.  I'm convinced that it isn't related to
&gt;the gearbox as I've put in another gearbox recently and the noise is still
&gt;there. Also, on both gearboxes third gear is hard to get into from second
&gt;gear, either when moving or stationary. I've read Bob Hoover's sermon on
&gt;'Hard Shifting in the VW Bus' and am now suspicious that the two problems
&gt;are related and are symptomatic of worn nylon bushing(s?) that contain the
&gt;shifter-rod in the housing.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else dealt with these problems before - am I on the right
&gt;track?

Since I swapped transmissions, I hear a rattle like you describe while in
4th gear.  It can be silenced by pushing up lightly on the gear shift while
in gear.  I don't think it is the transmission, because it is newly
rebuilt.  I suspect it is a problem with a length of the shift rod (too
long?).  I'm going to try adjusting the coupler first.
