Subject: [T2] RE: Rear brake shoes

[snip]
&gt;Were some shoes manufactured so that the hand break lever
&gt;was *not* removable? Can I get just the levers? Can I replace the shoes with
&gt;out the levers and drive with not emergency brake (for now)? Help

1) drill out the rivets holding your levers to the old shoes. don't go all
the way through; drilling from top down just nick off enough of one head of
each rivet, and the bottom will drop out.
2) you have locally bought two new anchor pins (211 609 601B) and two
anchor retaining clips, horseshoe style (211 609 619), because pulling pins
from the boneyard is rediculous.
3) slip that all together, button up the e-brake cable to your existing
re-attached lever.
4) park on a hill, walk away with confidence... yee-haw!
