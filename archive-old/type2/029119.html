Hi David,

Well, I'm still stuck with my carbs in a snit.  Additionally, my valves
started chattering and so need to adjust them again. I believe I've got  34
PDSIT 2/3 carbs, as shown in Haynes at chapter 3  page 23.

Section 3 page 15 of Haynes (Adjusting Dual Carbs) #3 says pull the retard
vacuum hose off and seal it. However, I can't tell which of the 2 hoses
going from dizzy to left carb is which.  Neither tube moves anything in the
dizzy when sucked upon, as far as I can tell.  I haven't got any carb
cleaner or starting fluid, just WD40, tranny oil, 30 weight and some KY(for
emergencies).  Can I use anything else to check for leaks?  I also want to
replace my vacuum hoses, they're old and crispy but intact.

Can I drive the bus with the idle high(1200), the carbs unsynched, etc. to
go and get these things or will I fry my motor?

Adjusting the air mx screw and the idle adjust screw still has the same
effects I mentioned before.  Turning out the idle adjust increases the RPM's
and makes the air intake tube sound like a dentist's suction thingy.  Louder
and louder.  The air mix screw has no effect unless its screwed in all the
way, which makes the engine idle rougher.  But still, if both screws are all
the way in, the idle still holds at about 1200 RPM.

I checked the archives, but didn't find much other than chit chat about
which kind is better, I.e get fuel injection and a recommendation to just
take it to a mechanic.

I would absolutely love any help you can offer!  Next time you're in
Seattle, the beerverages are on me!

Thanks!

Landon
Seattle
