Subject: Re: Price of a barn-door bus?

and thom say:

&gt;&gt;I found a barn-door panel van bus in the junk yard and am wondering what
it is 
&gt;&gt;worth if it were spotless. I also need to know the year of it. It has
nipple 
&gt;&gt;type front signals, small rear window, small rear stop lights, horizontal 
&gt;&gt;cooling lines on the rear and some kind of liitle compartment or something 
&gt;&gt;between the heads of the driver and the passenger.

The fact that it has nipple turn signals and the fresh air box automatically
disqualifies it as a barndoor.  There was an optional air-scoop, aka
&quot;ambulance scoop&quot; but thats a whole different ball 'o wax.

i disagree.    I have seen turn signals put on the front of barndoor buses,
for those who did not believe in semaphores as functional.   Also, my 53 has
a vent box on the roof in the cab, though different from the later vent
system.   Is it possible for the sighter to check for the roof overhang
(eyebrow) and the prescence or lack thereof of a dash?    Or check for the
VIN number?  I would be surprised if it was that early, though.
