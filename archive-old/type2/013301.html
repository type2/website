I need to get some gutter feet and a rack that will hold my

windsurfer above
the roof of my 72 Riviera.  

Grant, 
 Although I dont have a westy. My impression from the Volks
in the Wet Westy tribe would indicate that you could look
into Yakima Racks. They have many more configurations than
what you might think. Good luck!
