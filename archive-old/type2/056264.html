&lt;&lt; Now, this is one hurting bus to begin with.  The rear shock mounts broke 
  quite some time ago, due to the fact that the IRS installation guy 
  didn't bother to put new shock mounts on and his mickey mouse shock 
  attachment method just didn't work at all.  So I'm thinking that by the 
  time I fix all these things, I'll have spent more money than I paid for 
  the bus and it'll still be a rusty old hippy bus with a screwed up rear 
  end.  
  Conclusion:  I need a new bus, bad.  &gt;&gt;

Diana,

Stop being so silly.  Fix your bus.

Of course it's going to be expensive.  Did you expect owning an antique
vehicle would be cheap?  If you're the type that just uses things up and
throws them away, you shouldn't have bought a Volkswagen -- you'll be throwing
one away every six months!  Volkswagens -- especially those over thirty years
old -- require constant maintenance and repair to keep them running.

You need the help of friends and chances are you have plenty of them out here
although you don't know it.  You need someone with a MIG welder and space to
work on a bus.  You also need a couple of threaded steel barrels for the new
shock mounts (the lack of shocks is probably what lead to the structural
failure) and about one square foot of .050&quot; (or close to it) mild steel plate,
common stuff at any sheet-metal shop, welding shop, scrap metal yard, etc.

After finding the weldor and his welding rig and the place to work, pull your
engine and tranny, dismantle the swing arm, grind away the failed weld and put
the bracket back into position using hose-clamps around the torsion-bar
housing.  Get the alignment right, tack-weld the bracket, re-check the
alignment then weld that puppy in place.

Make a cardboard pattern of your frame-members  starting just aft of the 'ox-
bow' and extending about a foot to the rear.  Transfer the shape to the sheet
of mild steel, cut out TWO of them (ie, one for each side), clamp in place and
weld.  Be careful of the wiring loom on the passenger-side.  

This will convert that portion of your frame-rail into a box-section,
providing the strength you need for the re-positioned shock-mount.

To mount your shocks with an IRS-type tranny you need a threaded steel barrel
welded into the frame-rail so the mounting bolt of the shock is now
perpendicular to the face of the frame-rail instead of parallel.  You'll have
to make the threaded barrels on a lathe.  The finished length of the threaded
steel barrel must be at least one-quarter of an inch longer than the thickness
of the frame-rail.  The eighth of an inch that will protrude from either side
is to insure an adequate weldment. 

Fabriation of the threaded barrels is a simple turning operation.  The thread,
the length of which should match the length of the threaded portion of the
bolts you'll be using, should be cut with a suitable tap but my be threaded
single-point if the machinist does not have the proper tap or if they have
masochistic tendencies.  Round bar-stock, 3/4&quot; or larger in diameter, of mild
steel, is suitable for these barrels. 

Drill a hole thru the frame-rails to match the diameter OD of the barrels,
insert the threaded barrel (threaded portion to the inside) and weld the
barrel to the frame-rail. 

Dismantle &amp; inspect your CV's before putting everything back together.  If
you've been running without shocks you've probably ruined a lot more than the
swing-arm.

Now get hot and track down a weldor and machinist who are willing to help.
rec.crafts.metalworking has thousands of subscribers around the world, even a
few in the Pacific Northwest.  Most of them know how to weld and virtually all
of them can turn out the barrels you need in their sleep, although you may
need to buy them a suitable metric tap.  Post an appeal for help.  Also cross-
post to the other VW-specific mailing lists.  

The probability is high that there is someone within an hours drive of you who
has the tools and the skills and the willingness to help you through this
difficulty.    

I know -- your bus has let you down.  You want to just swing your gear into
another bus and drive off into the sunset... and probably tear that one up the
same way, appealing to the list to help you find another cheap ride each time
you tear one up.  

If only life were that easy.

You broke your bus.  Now it's time to fix your bus.  Or go buy a Toyota.

-Bob Hoover

PS -- Your message was forwarded to me by someone on the Vintage Bus mailing
list who knew I'd helped you before.  This is good evidence people are willing
to help you now, however they can. Abandoning your bus... now that you've
broken it -- is not the sort of message you want to be sending.  -- rsh
