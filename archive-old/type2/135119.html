&gt; Can anyone help an ignoramus figure out why I keep getting gas in my

&gt; Also it comes out in fine droplets from the breather cap (I think 
&gt; that9s
&gt; what it is).  The black cap with thick rubber hose that originates 
&gt; near the
&gt; fan shroud and puts exhaust back in front of the throttle (between the 
&gt; air
&gt; meter and throttle).  My plugs don9t get oily.  Also is this something 
&gt; to
&gt; worry about?  Thank you listees.  BTW its a 79 FI 2.0 AC Wedge.  Can9t
&gt; figure out where or why gas and oil would come in contact.

Is your exhaust stinky, like its running rich?  You really have fuel 
spraying out of the breather cap?!

&gt; One more question, water coming from the exhaust?  I know lots of cars 
&gt; do
&gt; this but now that it9s getting cold, mine does it and never used to.

Water is a by-product of combustion.  Once your engine gets up to 
operating temperature, it will burn it off better.  When it's colder 
outside, the water vapor is more likely to condense at the tailpipe.
