Subject: Re: [T2] Metal fuel line

Instead of lacquer thinner try Berymens Chemtool Carb Cleaner. This stuff will
dissolve most anything including paint. So BE CAREFUL! But it's not as explosive
as thinner and is designed for carb and F.I. systems so when used per the
instructions it will not eat your gaskets and/or O rings.
My Advise is to remove all metal fuel lines and soak in Chemtool at room temp.
(Not at 15 degrees like it was here this morning). Be very careful about doing
this in a garage, The fumes are extreeeeeeemly hazardous to your health.
Definitely read the can before use! Drain the solvent from the lines then blow out
with compressed air. Don't even think about blowing them out by mouth! If you
don't have compressed air just drain them. Spray a little more chemtool through
them until it runs out clean. Reassemble metal lines using new hoses and clamps.
This cleaner can also be used in the gas tank to clear any varnish but be prepared
to change clogged filters from the dislodged varnish.
Good Luck
Tom

&gt; Yes, the black goo is gasoline turned to &quot;varnish&quot;.  It can get hard as
&gt; rock(or harder) and the only thing I found that would dissolve it was
&gt; lacquer thinner(very slowly).  Lacquer thinner is probably bad for every
&gt; other part in your fuel system and highly explosive.
&gt;
&gt; I dissasembled/replaced *everything* that was touched by it, except the
&gt; gas tank.....wishing I had done it also now, but it required removing the
&gt; engine and I wasn't ready for that yet.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
