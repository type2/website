Subject: list customer service

 
--Though the list is handy, it is &quot;staffed&quot; by volunteers, and is not a &quot;service&quot;. You aren't garanteed a reply. Try posting again.

Make sure your posts are as clear as possible, try your best to use correct terminology, p/n's, etc. It helps to get a clear answer.

(not a brake expert)

&gt;not to complain, but I'm wondering what I did wrong on the last two posts that I submitted about the brake regulator mount problem I had.  No one replied!  Did I breach some etiquette?
