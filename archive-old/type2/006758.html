&gt;&gt; That message propogated in five, count 'em, five seconds. I've been doing
&gt;&gt; config all afternoon and it receipts commands in real-time. As fast as I
&gt;
&gt;&quot;All afternoon&quot; you say ... what do you do for fun ?!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Were you the one I told that this ran in IBM mainframe? I lied, it's
&gt;&gt; running in Windoze.
&gt;
&gt;I presume Windoze95 ? ... on a Pentium (how fast ? or is this one of those
&gt;new-fangled dual processor units. Opps! the dualies are only offered on
&gt;the Mac platform, so far!)

Now you've done it. &quot;Opps&quot; is the most superb solecism I've ever read.
Congratulations. ;)

It seems to run out of a Pentium 133. I don't know the exact platform but
it might be NT because it didn't crash all night. Here I've spent years
staying fastidiously uncontaminated by any Wintel pathogen and now look.
Come out and FIGHT, Hoover! ;)

&gt;Personally, I prefer my SunSparc5 (wish I had a 10 or SGI). When I really
&gt;want to smoke, I can dump my work on one of the Cray's downstairs. Problem
&gt;with them is I can't fit them on my desktop, or my office for that matter.

I'd like one too, please. If I want to smoke the Cruise Director makes me
go outside.

&gt;Where's the support for the &quot;listserv&quot; platform, software, net connection
&gt;comming from ?

Physicaly I think it's in one of those cities in Maryland that exist in
order not to be a cities in Washington.
