&gt;  Well, I don't know... I sure do *wish* that the loaf slider block was
&gt;  available, and if anyone has seen one, let me know!  but at the present
&gt;  time, I think all that is available is the Vanagon slider block.  


Yes I've seen one - its on my '98 Brazilian T2 which is sat just outside my 
front door. 
I also found one in the first catalogue of a VW parts seller that I picked up 
this is part number 211-843-368 so is not for a Vanagon. Oh it was right next 
to the roller wheel, the cam, and the lever catch. All parts marked genuine 
VW.

Please before posting that a part is no longer availlable, and misleading all 
the other list subscribers, can folk check in the parts catalogues of the 
leading suppliers (eg Bus Stop, Rocky Mountain Motor Works, Just Kampers etc).

The above parts were all in the current Just Kampers catalogue which can be 
ordered from their web site (www.justkampers_dot_com). Just because they are in 
the UK it doesnt stop anyone placeing an order by e-mail with their credit 
card. A sliding door guide block sent by air mail 
would work out at under $15 dollars.

Good luck
