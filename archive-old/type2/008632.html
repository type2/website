Best Bus Results........
Well 3 days  after I posted the &quot;Best Bus&quot; question...the numbers
are in....done some basic number crunching....and here are the
results.....

1971 - 2
  72 - 1
  75 - 2
  77 - 2
  78 - 9
  81 - 1

...now understnad that thus far we have a mere 17 replies...
but I think one could extrapolate those numbers across a much
wider base and you would still have similar results....

Guess the  '78' vintage would appear to be the popular year
hands down according to our listees...
So those that are more knowledgable about these matters than I .
have spoken...advice well taken..

It would appear the search is on, in ernest for '78' vintage
vans/parts  et al..
&amp; as someone ( far more wiser than I) once said....
..&quot; You couldn't go far wrong, no matter which model 
year you chose !&quot;

Thanks to all who took time to voice their opinions...

74 microbus  &amp;  78 Champagne Edition.. &amp; counting..
