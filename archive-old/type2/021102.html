Re running way too rich and not starting....Sounds like the 75 I got
that started, belched black smoke, and quits---check the wire going to
the head temp sensor- (mine was broken at the terminal spade)-if it's
off or not connected, it will think you are in the arctic and try to run
WAY RICH.  Look on the left side near #3 cyl- leaning thru the inside
upper hatch is the easiesat way.
Bentley tells how to test it- run an ohmeter between the terminal end
and ground- should be around 2500 ohms at 68 degrees.  If it is not,
could be a bad sensor or not grounding- try getting 2500 oms worth of
resistance (resistors or a poterntiometer) from Radio Sh. and put it
between the lead wire and a good ground- will it run OK then?? 
Resistance will drop as the engine warms.  You should also test the
sensor in the Air Flow Meter-terminals 6 and 27 should also have around
2500 ohms between them.  MB 78 Westy
