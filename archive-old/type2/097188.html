Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot Bear WILL NOT COME OUT

 I had one like that. If I remember the size, I got a 5/8&quot; fine thread bolt
and
 screwed it into the bearing shell. It bottomed out in the crank and I keep
 turning it and the shell followed the threads out the crank. I think I had
to
 grind the 1st couple of threads to get it started.

Very clever man! :0) Jan B
