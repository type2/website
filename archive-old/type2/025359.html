Hi there:

Tuesday I was driving my orange and beige '79 into the North Haven Home
Depot, when I saw an early, very nice bay window exiting the parking lot. I
gave a toot on my horn, and figured I wouldn't be seeing another bus for a
couple of weeks.

When we (my two year old and I) came out of the Home Depot, there was a blue
and white '71 Westy parked immediately next to my bus.

What a pleasure. Thought I'd share it. I wonder if either driver was a list
member.

Rob
