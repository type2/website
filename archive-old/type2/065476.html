                          Bad Boot(s)

Just before the Big Sur run in February '95 I replaced my axle boots.  The
old ones were not torn or leaking but they were old and I was working on the
tranny so it seemed the proper thing to do.

The replacement boots were purchased from Pacific Bugs in Oceanside, CA.  The
shop is about ten minutes from my house.  They carry a good stock of VW
parts, including rubber axle boots of German manufacture, the type I prefer. 

Shortly after those colorful urethane boots were introduced I installed a
pair on my '67 Baja.  That was, oh... ten years ago?  One of them leaks a
little at the seam.  Not much, but it makes a mess on the boot.  When I had
to do the boots on the '68 sedan I opted for German rubber.  No leaks.  But I
didn't bother to replace the urethane.

I honestly expected to get eight or ten years service from the German rubber
boots I installed on the bus back in '95 and thought the leak must have been
due to a cut, possibly picked up on the Dempster Highway.  But on close
inspection I can see that the opposite boot is seriously cracked, getting all
set to start leaking too.  

Crawled under the '68.  Sure enough, the boots are checked.  Drive it a
little, I'm going to have a pair of cracked boots.  Checked the Baja.  Ugly,
yellow urethane boots are slick and smooth, as sound as the day they were
installed, except for that one damn leaky spot along the seam where I
probably squeezed out the sealant.  You don't want to tighten them down very
much.  Snug is fine.

Replacing axle boots isn't difficult although it can be messy.  But the
thought of  replacing the boots every year just doesn't make sense.
 Especially when the German rubber boots are nearly twice as expensive as
those horrible urethane thingees.  

I'm going to put a set of horrible urethane thingees on my bus, see how they
do.  Once burned, twice shy -- and there's definitely something strange about
a pair of new German rubber boots lasting barely a year.  Old stock?  Don't
seem likely since Pacific Bugs only carries a couple of sets at a time.  More
likely, improper storage somehwere along the line, or too much pollution, or
perhaps a change in the rubber formulation?  I don't know.  But I don't have
time to figure it out and I have a pair of urethane boots on my Baja that
have been there since Jeeter was a pup with no sign of deterioration, so
urethane it is.

If there's a pair of boots in your future, a word to the wise:  The seam goes
horizontal.  About half the split-boots I see are installed with the seam up,
apparently on the assumption they will leak less.  And maybe they will, but
the seam is supposed to be on the neutral axis, where the flexure of the boot
is least.  The only torn urethane boots I've seen, the seam was on the top.
