Subject: A Dormobile weekend...

Hi,

   This weekend I thought I'd devote some time to my 72 dormobile.....
   Too cut a long story short, I decided to take out the large cabinet 
section behind the drivers seat (rhd)... arghh ! There is a large rusty gash 
(about 5mm wide, 30cm long) on the floor section where it meets the back of 
the seat (the seat back is also quite rusty, a gash at the level of the 
bottom of the front door) also the near-side rear wheel arch is very 
rusty... left side is fine !
What should I do... replace the floor section, seat back and rear wheel arch 
? If so... what is it likely to cost ?

Cheers

Dave K.
