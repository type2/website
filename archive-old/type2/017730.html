Spotted these on a drive back from Lexington to Murray.

72 bus, orange.  Engine and transmission ok, front end bunged up.
74 bus, tan.  No engine or transmission (parts bus maybe?)

They are at the Field House restaurant, Exit 12 on the West KY Parkway.  Now
you know as much about them as do I.  For details contact Jim Hamm,
(270)365-5003 or 9951 (that's the restaurant).

Jim also sez he's got several other VWs and Porsches for sale, not at the
restaurant.
