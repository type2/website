Subject: doophed up friday question

my neighbor is a bug guy. we were yakin' while i was putting in my carb,
and i asked if whether his bugs have that tube through the shroud
encapsulating/protecting  the accelerator cable; if whether his come
forward and stays forward. he sez, what i need is that spring deal that
lives between the fan shround and the barrel nut. now i have been seeing
those springs on bugs but never on a bus. is this another thing we pilots
leave off? or, is there some kinda grommet that holds it around front  -
steve, 68
