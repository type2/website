Subject: Re: [T2] Harbor Freight motorcycle jack on sale

&gt;From: Richard Atwell


&gt;That's what I did. I called first and they asked me to bring the ad. When I 
&gt;got there it was even lower than the advertised sale price so I ended up 
&gt;paying that.



Did you have the $5 off coupon part? You probably could have used it too 
even with the store price being lower. I have printed and used thier coupons 
before to a great advantage. Harbor Freight is a wonderful place. 2 things 
you need, 15 things you might need, 15,000 you don't need...but you could 
use. That last one always makes up for the $5 I would have saved. &quot;Well let 
me see here I could walk out with the 5spot or I could get this super jumbo 
box of 874 zip ties, or that 3 Pc. set of hammers, or that 20 count pack of 
screwdrivers, or that cupcake cook book with complementary meat grinder 
attachment, weather vane, ceramic rooster, fishing lures, dog collars....&quot;  
I get carried away just like thier inventory. I really don't buy all that 
stuff but they certainly have a way of getting that $5 back no matter what 
and I end up with unopened packages of this and that here and there. But I 
can use them later ;).

Later,
