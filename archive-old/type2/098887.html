&gt; 	I used to be a happy user of Gunk's spray products but

&gt; good old  Orange Hand Cleaner, non-abrasive. Gojo or whatever.

Bad news. Gojo's first three ingredients are water (OK) paraffin (the
solvent, not the wax) and mineral oil.  Both paraffin and mineral oil are
petro-chemicals.  The rest of the ingredient list doesn't look like
something I'd like to eat either!

I've always wondered why this stuff is OK to flush down the sink while
petroleum solvents that aren't called &quot;hand cleaners&quot; were not.  It's a
mystery!
