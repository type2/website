Subject: RE: Trip computer

The Palm pilot sounds interesting, does it gather and display the
information while you drive along and if so how do you interface it with the
Bus, some sort of serial cable connection or something.  The trip computer I
was looking at is quite small and could be mounted under the dash or
whatever and because it's in kit form you could even have the display on a
ribbon cable in a small box to make it even less intrusive.  As for Karma
and no new holes, my Bus already has a V8 engine, 235/75/15 tires and so
many other mods one more hole won't bother me, or my bus.  I'm slowly
working on building what I consider to be the perfect camper for my
requirements.  In saying that though I'd never cut a hole in my lovely 62
bug :)

Cheers

============================&gt;
I got a Palm Pilot for Christmas, and downloaded &quot;Highway&quot; program into 
it.
It does all of this, and Christian keeps improving his software.
The program is awesome for letting me keep tabs on all my car costs, 
performance, etc.
Best part..... My bus keeps more of it's true karma without any new holes.
