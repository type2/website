Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

&gt; One thing went wrong; I was using synthetic enamel and my friend John
&gt; plugged the compressed air supply hose into an air supply that had a line
&gt; oiler on it full of Marvel Mystery oil.
&gt; I knew there were two air supplies, one with a series of dryers on the
&gt; line and the other with line oiler for impact tools. I just never
&gt; considered that John could not know this.
&gt; John didn't catch this and I had a very nice looking flat finish on my
&gt; car that never dried.
&gt; I didn't go back and rave at John, I just waited about six months and
&gt; sanded it down with lacquer thinner and had another go at it with clean
&gt; dry air supply.
&gt; If prep is everything then running off the visitors is the next most
&gt; important thing.

IMO, your friend John is lucky to be alive. I'd have made him sand it out. 
Are you still friends with John? 
Did you finally get the good job you wanted?   
You are right.. pesky friends can really mess you up.
