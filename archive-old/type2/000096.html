Volks,

 Buttoning everything up and ready to adjust my valves I went back thru check 
list and realized I had not installed the retaining wires for the push rods.
 1 Its not extremly clear how they go on but feel like I gotem on right.
 2 What in the world is the pupose of them, they dont look like they do a 
thing, are they still called for?
 Maybe I dont have them exactly right cause they dont appear to do much..
