Subject: frost free carbs :-)

1974/dual carb/1800
every now and then the passenger side carb frosts up
resulting in a very interesting driving experience.
If I go back and wiggle (reseat) the tube that brings
up the hot air it cures it.. so I will be pulling and
cleaning and inspecting the works.
  The questions I have are..
1) What kind, if any, preventtive maint. can be done
to the preheat assembly.
2) The vac line is shown going to the passenger side
carb intake channel and is hooked up via the dual
connector on the bottom side. Which nipple is the
right
one to hook to? Or is it even needed?
3) I suspect the air volume control flap in the
preheat
tube is sticky so I will clean it but is there
anything
that should or shouldnt be done there?(i.e. can I
screw
up something while cleaning it?)
  Also I need to replace the air filter I noticed...
could a dirty air filter restrict enough to cause this
freeze up? why just one and not both..
  Anyhew.. any thoughts are very welcome!

Dan
