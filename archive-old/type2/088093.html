&gt; And I have a bus question... I have been planning on buying a bus for a
&gt; while now to be my daily driver... and now that I am very close to doing
so
&gt; (might own her by this weekend), I am nervous because I have a pretty long
&gt; commute (25 miles each way).  Is it obnoxiously stupid for me to consider
&gt; using a bus in this way?  Does anyone do this?  Is there any special
&gt; maintenance considerations?
&gt;
I do a daily commute of 10 miles each way in my bus.....on a normal day. On
other days, or weeks, I commute 50 miles each way to our other plant. No
troubles at all. Just keep in mind that putting 50 miles a day on your bus
will accelerate the maintenance schedule and, if anything, make regular
maintenance even more important.

Go for it.

Dave
