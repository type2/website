Subject: Keep or Sell?

Hello all,
  My husband and I recently bought a 1967 walkthrough deluxe (pretty
sure...not my thing) from a friend who was moving and needed to get rid
of it quick.  Although I myself am not in love with this vehical as most
of you are with yours, I can appreciate a VW's indestructability and
versitality.  Since I am a partner on this project and don't really know
a lot about what is involved in restoring a bus (cost and time) I would
like to ask you good folks for some personal experiences.
  The bus is in fair condition, no major rust, (surface on roof), engine
needs a carburator, new tires, new key, rubber seals for the windows,
and the bench seat in the back. Do the seats come with seatbelts that
far back?   I need to have them for the kids. (plead ignorance)
  The reason I'm curious about how long it takes is because I'm going to
need to replace my old car soon and can either drive the bus, or sell it
and get something else.  I'm willing to except the expense of fixing it
up, if it's not going to take 6 months to do it.  Is that unreasonable?
Please let me know.
  I don't know if this is a Friday subject or not.  If it is then please
answer P-mail as I don't wish to make any waves with your rules.
                                                      Thanks!
                                                &quot;married to one&quot;
