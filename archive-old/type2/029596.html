&gt; I have a 72 bus and My mechanic and I just realized the other day that it has

Not true.  All you need to do is add a port to one of the intake
manifolds.  If you want to get fancy, a port in each with a balance tube
is even better.  The port(s) should be large enough to accomodate the
hose, so that you get enough airflow to evacuate the booster properly.
