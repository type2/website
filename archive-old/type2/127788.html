Subject: Re: [T2] Wires go to where?

The '77 (assuming stock) doesn't have a full throttle switch, or an electric switch for the EGR. I have the same wires on mine, and came to the same conclusion as Karl a couple years ago (he probably told me too). Pumpkin II has been running cheerfully for thousands of miles with those wires just taped up.
