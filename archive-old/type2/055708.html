Subject: Re: horn substitute/replacement

George,

 The loudness of a horn should be considered. Loud enough to attract
attention, but not so loud as to startle.      170db...... a weapon of mass
destuction in the wrong hands.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Holy Cripes, 170db!

&gt;
&gt;That does seem a bit high, as each 10dB represents 10X the sound
&gt;energy. A jet engine at 30 meters is often cited as being around
&gt;140dB.  170dB would be like having 1000 jet engines running at full
&gt;power 30 meters away!  Perhaps they stuck the sound sensor into the
&gt;horn itself to get that reading!
&gt;
&gt;My personal feeling about horns is that there isn't any substitute for
&gt;the original, just as the Model T folks insist on the &quot;Ah-ooo-gah&quot;
&gt;horns for their vehicles.
