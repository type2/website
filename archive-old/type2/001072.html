Subject: Heat Asst. Fan Kit

Got one of those asst. fan kits for X-mas for my '78 Bus. The instructions
say to install it in the middle of the Bus where it looks like it would
direct the air to the 2 floor ducts before it reached the dash. I'd rather
have it right up front pulling air just to the front. Has anyone done this?
The switch that came with it also has 3 speeds. Is one of them off? If not ,
how do I wire it so its not always running?
Thanks a bunch.
