Subject: Re: [T2] disconnecting shift lever

&gt;Am I looking at the right place?
&gt;Is the square head screw the middle screw in the first picture?

Yep that's it. Tip - remove the grease buildup around the set screw 
then give it a squirt with penetrating oil. Also don't be shocked if
the shift rod doesn't separate completely after removing the screw 
from the coupler. You might have to work with it a bit.

Alex.
