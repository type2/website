&gt; &gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me
&gt; somewhat
&gt; &gt; confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This
&gt; may be
&gt; &gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.

  So I sez:    
Well my van is a Type II, but has a Type IV engine in it with the Type VII
option
What is a Type VII you ask?.

The PO of my van worked in a government lab, and some co-workers stuck a
radiation 
warning sticker his engine flap that says 

&quot;Caution this equipment emits X-Rays when Energized&quot;

I got the van around the cold fusion fiasco, so when anyone asked me about 
the radiation sticker, I told them I had installed the &quot;Type VII Cold Fusion
Option&quot;
that has Palladium Plated pistons, and a  heavy water injection system. This

gives me 70% higher power, and I get 120,000 miles per gallon of heavy
water.

Some people buy this story, and ask if I like the option, 
or where do I get the heavy water.

IF it gets this far I usually tell them that it is OK in the summer, but in
the winter,
the Helium in the exhaust tends to leak out cracks in the exhaust, and
collect in the 
engine compartment , making the back end light, and ruining my traction (
