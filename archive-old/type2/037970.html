&gt; Anyone, know the best way to do this ?  (I want a nice neat *Round* hole)
&gt; I'll also want to fit a lighter-socket in a similar manner.

The best way to get a guage-sized round hole is to head on down to the
hardware store and buy a hole saw.  this is a cylindrical saw with a drill
bit centered in it to keep the saw on center.  Be sure to get one with
fine teeth for cutting metal!

Also, be sure that the area behind where you are drilling doesn't have
wiring and such to run into.  Also be sure that there is room for the
gauge you intend to install, including the wiring and brackets.
