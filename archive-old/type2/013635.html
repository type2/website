&gt;BTW, lacquer topcoat is NLA. Thank the EPA for that one.

Actually...

lacquer is back, officially available around me (MD, PA, WV) but I'm
pretty sure everywhere to hobbyists only.  Around here a bunch of
places illegally never quit selling it, but it is legally available for our
use again but not for commercial (shop) application.

However aside from it being the fastest easiest thing to spray, I still
don't unless it is a real tiny spot repair.  Regardless I could go to my
PPG guy and have a gallon of Duracryl mixed right now if I wanted.

For once the EPA responded to reality, a rare occurrence.
