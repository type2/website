Subject: Re: [T2] '78 wiring harness

&gt; Howdy all, seems finding a wiring harness for a '78
&gt; bus  is impossible

Been thinking about this. Number one, get the wiring diagrams off the type2
list for your bus. They're in color and have wire gauges in the German
style, cross sectional area by cm2 I believe. There's charts to translate
this into AWG (american wire gauge?).

I'd get the closest available main harness, compare it to your old one and
the wiring diagrams, and add whatever wires you needed using good electrical
methods. (color codes, shrink wrap tubing them up together for specific
runs. I plan to run electrical conduit underneath and inside my bus when I
do it.

It would be time consuming, but that's what I'm gonna do with my 76 bus/79
cal. engine combo when time comes.

Print out the wiring diagram that's correct for your bus and mark it up with
the changes/additions so you'll always have a working drawing of your elec.
system for yourself or mechanic or the next guy...
