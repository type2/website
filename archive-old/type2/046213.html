You got it!  good absorbers are good emitters!  Otherwise, something that
was a good emitter but a poor absorber would naturally sit at a
temperature below ambient, a violation of the second law of thermo.

&gt; instead of flat black.

Silver is almost as good as black in absorbtion, even though most folk
think of silver as a light, reflective color.
