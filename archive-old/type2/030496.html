Hi Volks,

I've been following Herr Doktor Tim's discourses on the DM, and
enjoying them thoroughly... thought I'd kick in a few comments.

It's not that the German engineers had (or have) any inherent superiority
to engineers in the rest of the world, but that the German engineers were
the first to realize the long-term value of good design, as applied to
common, everyday things.  Quality has *always* been available for a price,
but it took a unique combination of practical consumers and sharp
engineers to produce _affordable_ quality.

I think it took most American consumers a looooong time to figure this
out... hence the dissatisfaction of so many Americans with the TypeI, when
it was first introduced.  The consumer culture just wasn't ready to
realize that a little simple maintenance on a regular basis would give
them a more reliable and enduring car than what Detroit had to offer.

The DM mentality has long been prevalent in industries when the price of
failure is far greater than the cost of good design; aviation and space,
nuclear plants, submarines, racing.  The engineering goal is to understand
the system well enough to predict when failures will occur, and then
prescribe maintenance or replacement of parts on a schedule that will keep
failures from happening.

Most of my work is with helicopters. Helicopters have a few more parts
than a Volkswagen, and the consequences of their failure are an order of
magnitude greater. In addition to similar types of maintenance as we
perform regularly on our Busses, helicopters get lots of their moving
parts *replaced* on a regular interval.  Why? Because the engineers that
designed the system calculated that, after some number of hours of
operation, those parts might fail. And they wrote in the manual, &quot;replace
these parts after xxx hours.&quot; Very much like the engineers at VW wrote
&quot;adjust the valves every xxx miles&quot; -- if you want to avoid catastrophe,
it is wise to heed the maintenance schedule; a lot of thought went into
its making.  

My belief is that the first tenet of the DM is &quot;kennen Sie das
System&quot; -- &quot;understand the system&quot;.  Take care of that, and all else will
follow. I try to work towards understanding the system every time I touch,
drive, or work on my Bus... and the more progress I make, the better my
Bus runs.

Those are my ramblings for the evening -- thanks everyone for making up
the Type2 List!
