Subject: Help- first 1800 tuneup- TDC and timing

List wouldn't take this the first time, for some
unknown reason.  

&gt; I'm under my 74 1800 manual federal bus trying
&gt; to
&gt; get it tuned up the first time.  It was very,
&gt; very sluggish off the line, then pulled hard at
&gt; RPM.  PO said mechanic told him it was the 009.
&gt; 
&gt; I hoped he was right.  
&gt; 
&gt; Plan was new dizzy, points, time, valves, maybe
&gt; plugs.  
&gt; 
&gt; The adventure began with installing an
&gt; appropriate vac dizzy that I got this weekend. 
&gt; (Thanks Clark!)
&gt; 
&gt; Spring is in the drive hole.  Dizzy seats ok. 
&gt; 10mm nut on.  Points set to .018.  Check vac
&gt; advance and retard again.  Seem to work.  All
&gt; seems well.  
&gt; 
&gt; Carefully review the plug wires with the Haynes
&gt; diagram.  It seems right.  Condensor is to the
&gt; right and slightly to the front.  (Muir: front
&gt; is
&gt; front.)  
&gt; 
&gt; I have a dwell/tach and strobe.  I'm going to
&gt; time the thing statically first.  Then double
&gt; check dwell followed by the timing w/ timing
&gt; gun.
&gt;  (Then valve's-- figured I needed to find TDC
&gt; for
&gt; this anyway.  Then compression.  Maybe plugs if
&gt; necessary.  No carb adjustment until I get the
&gt; tools.)
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is TDC.  There is no timing scale
&gt; on
&gt; the engine.  No factory marks that I can find
&gt; on
&gt; the fan.  There are two paint marks, obviously
&gt; applied by PO or PO's mechanic.  Paint marks do
&gt; not seem to correspond w/ TDC.  Or the proper
&gt; place for Cyl #1 on the distributor.  (Dizzy
&gt; has
&gt; that little notch.  I know it cannot be trusted
&gt; until timed but there is no way to turn the
&gt; dizzy
&gt; that far clockwise because the vac pot hits the
&gt; block.  Vac pot would be all the way to the
&gt; rear.)
&gt; 
&gt; Checked TDC with wire.  Very vague but I found
&gt; it
&gt; to be about 30 degrees to the right of the
&gt; painted mark.  (Other painted mark is 180 of
&gt; the
&gt; first.)  I double checked TDC with my thumb. 
&gt; There is a range on the fan where there is no
&gt; suction and no compression.  It corresponds
&gt; with
&gt; arc where I felt TDC with the wire.  I marked
&gt; the
&gt; beginning and end of this.  I assume true TDC
&gt; is
&gt; exactly in the middle of this arc?  
&gt; 
&gt; I double checked the valves to ensure this is
&gt; TDC.  Both had slacked.  (Will set later.) 
&gt; Turned the alternator clockwise, heard exhaust.
&gt; 
&gt; Exhaust valve had no slack.  Continued around
&gt; until the TDC area was back on top, both valves
&gt; had no slack.  360 more degrees and I'm back at
&gt; what I believe is TDC and both #1 valves are
&gt; slack.  
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have TDC?  The rotor button stills seems
&gt; to
&gt; far clockwise (looking from above) past the #1
&gt; wire (and moving toward #4).  Perhaps I have
&gt; the
&gt; plugs wires wrong?  Pot is all the way to the
&gt; clockwise as far as case will allow.  Should it
&gt; be more in the middle of its range of motion?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the help.  If a guru is
&gt; available
&gt; for a phone call, please send a number.
