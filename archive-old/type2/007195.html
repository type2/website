The 1mm step is a 'head gasket' (it should be removable) and is stock in most type4 engines. 
Allegedly, VW released a 'white paper' around 1990 that specifies that these be removed and the decrease in deck height be compensated for with a shim of the same height between the cylinder and case.
I replaced them in my engine and added a .070&quot; shim under the cylinders to lower the compression even further. Long story.

You have two right side (1/2 side) heads from the 1800cc dual-carbed 1974 bus engine.  These heads have the biggest stock valves VW ever released in a bus engine.  Shouldn't make a difference that they're both 'right side' as long as the air injection ports are sealed.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; I had the misfortune of a dropped valve seat in my '74 Westy,, 1.8 liter
&gt; dual carb
&gt; I have located a replacement head that is in fairly good shape,, But, the
&gt; combustion chambers appear to be different!  The one has approx 1mm step
&gt; that looks like a head gasket or shim, and the other is flat where the
&gt; cylinder barrel contacts the head..
&gt; ,,
