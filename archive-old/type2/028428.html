Ok you got my attention,

Here goes,

Vehicles manufactured from 8/67-7/69 had the
Parcel Shelf (German Name: Ablagenetz) (layman:
Net)
This is the Campmobile 1968 (Serial #
13001/1968-18147/1969)

Vehicles manufactured from 8/69-7/71 had the
Casing (box under roof) ( German Name: Gerhause)
(layman: ceiling cabinet)
There are two kinds one for a pop top and one for
bus without pop top.
We have the ceiling cabinet parts if anyone needs
them.
This is the Campmobile 1970 (Serial #
0.00001-1.25000)

Look at the little plate on the rear z-bed box for
your Campmobile year and Serial #

I hope this helps,

Jason:

My 69 Westy has an elastic net with a wire frame
that hangs above the rear
bed.  But my Westy has a poptop, and from what I
know, the poptop Westies
have the net; the hardtop Westies have a shelf (I
have a 74 hardtop Westy,
and it has a shelf, and shelf is made from and
looks identical to the
material the cabinets are made of).

My Westy manuals (1968 and 1970) say otherwise.
The 1968 manual only
mentions the net, and my 1970 manual only mentions
the ceiling
cabinet.  The 1974 Westy manual I have says that
only hardtop Westies have
the ceiling cabinet.  Go figure...

I'm 99% sure what my 1969 Westy has is correct.
The only thing I've messed
with is adding an electric pump to the sink.  I
kinda wish I had the rear
cabinet so I had somewhere nice to mount some rear
speakers.  But the net
is handy for storing stuff at night when you're
sleeping back there.

I'd go snap some pictures, but my Westy is 300
miles from me right now..

&gt;Hi Joe.
&gt;
&gt;I recently bought a 69 hardtop Westy. (sorry, no
manual) but I was
&gt;wondeirng if you know wether yours is unaltered,
what is above your rear
&gt;bed area?
&gt;Mine has a plywood shelf, but no front on the
shelf, and the wood is wood,
&gt;not laminate like the cabinets. So I eckon it was
put there by a PO.
&gt;Someone else said there is a net that goes over
there instead of a shelf,
&gt;but VW had the shelf in 67 and I remember it in
my dad's 72.
&gt;
&gt;Whatcha got?
