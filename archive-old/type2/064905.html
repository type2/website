Subject: Re: Backup Light Switch

&gt;I have finally gotten all of my lights to work with the exception
&gt;of the backup lights.  Can someone tell me where the switch
&gt;is located?  Second question, anyone have a good recommendation for
&gt;tires for a 71 Westy?

The backup light switch is located on the nosecone of the transmission:
there are 2 wires going to it.  The switch closes when you put it in reverse.
