Or to look at it another way, how much of your money would you get back had
you bought the $20-30k mini van. I buy in to the philosophy that if I own my
vehicles, I'm paying myself, not the finance co, ins co, et al., i.e. if I
don't have to make that monthly payment I can put that $2-500 payment in a
repair account and if I don't have any repairs, I'm money to the good. In my
case, I paid 10k for a late model astro,(got to have a tow vehicle) have had
no payments for 5 years. Finally had to put a tranny in, hmm $600 for trans
repair equals about 2 months of payment, works for me. On the other hand, if
I was making a monthly payment, maybe there wouldn't be so many buses around
and I'd have more room.

&gt; Chuck,
&gt; Thanks for the reminder.  Plenty of that graffiti remover around here.
I'll
&gt; just sprinkle some around the DC to keep those nasty hexes away from it.
&gt;
&gt; Just a memory jogger, the DC being &quot;hex protected&quot; sat in a field from '65
to
&gt; '94 where almost everything under the truck was used to keep something
else
&gt; running.  With that being said, I didn't have any problem (physically,
&gt; emotionally, or otherwise) putting the truck into the condition as it
currently
&gt; stands.
&gt; 1960 Double Cab
&gt; '78 2L Hydraulic Type IV - rebuilt, balanced, larger valves &amp; converted to
&gt; Upright
&gt; '74 Thing IRS Trans - Beefed up big time by Rancho Performance
&gt; Stock height IRS conversion
&gt; '69 front Beam
&gt; '79 front disc brakes from torsion arms out + vacuum booster
&gt; '79 Rear Brakes
&gt; CIS Fuel Injection from '78 Volvo adapted to work with Type IV engine.
&gt; Not a single piece of metal was cut or mutilated to make this fit.  It
could go
&gt; back to stock given all the proper parts.  With the exception of the trans
work
&gt; and the machine work done on engine parts, everything was done by me.
&gt;
&gt; I've run the DC all over SoCal, loaded, unloaded, up hills and down.  Yes
it was
&gt; a lot of work.
&gt; Am I happy with it?  Absolutely.
&gt;
&gt; Another side benifit of the conversion is that most FLAPS still carry
parts for
&gt; a '79 Bus or '78 Volvo.  And there are MANY more of these in the junkyards
&gt; providing another source of parts.  I figure I might be driving my DC on a
&gt; regular basis long after many wisely start parking theirs in the garage
for
&gt; preservation purposes.
&gt;
&gt; Will I ever get my investment (both time and $$) out of it?  In the
traditional
&gt; respects, no freeking way.  But as I look at it, I already have.  Between
all
&gt; the work and the purchase of the original DC, I have about $7,500 into it.
My
&gt; wife was pushing me to buy a minivan around the time I got the DC.
Hmmmm.....
&gt; $7,500 and I have one heck of a fun vehicle and a functional one too.  Now
if I
&gt; were to have bought that minivan, I was looking at about $25k or so.   I
guess
&gt; that puts about $17K in the pot to cover my time spent working on the
&gt; conversion.  Not a bad chunk of change for having FUN on weekends and
evenings
&gt; instead of watching &quot;Must Not See TV&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Last time I checked, I wasn't a Shaman, just having fun impersonating one
:-)

&gt; &gt; Nah, Being in the SoCal area you can just grab some of that industrial
&gt; &gt; graffiti remover. Same stuff. 8-)
