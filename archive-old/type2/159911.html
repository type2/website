&gt; You don't have to spend the $$ on those if you don't have it. I got a

&gt; to, I just added some reach to the receivers. Total cost was like $20.

Yeah.. I have a set of vanagon retractable seatbelts as well, but I 
really just didn't want to deal with finding all the right hardware and 
what not.

It was pretty pricey, but it's new, and it was very convenient having 
everything bolt right in without trying to get all the special bolts and 
fabricate the brackets.  I was definitely paying for the 
convenience-factor ;)
