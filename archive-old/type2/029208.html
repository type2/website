If you have a doghouse oil cooler I wouldn't put your Turbo inlet near the
driver side cause that is where the cooler exhausts...  I also would watch
your temps while standing still with the heat off the exhaust of #2 and #3
going straight up and being sucked in by your fan...

What about on the highway, wouldn't the gap allow air to come in the
opposite direction of the scoops?  Would it make a dead spot in your engine
compartment?

Just idears....

Actually IF the gap is between the Fire wall and  the motor--Its  a good thing! as the air
that IS coming in to the engine compartment is Not the Hot exhaust air--Some people i know
actually create an opening there--It gives the air coming in a &quot;Turbo&quot; effect. I know many
will tell you to Seal the engine compartment the best you can  Which IS a good thing--But
from my experience with heat in Phoenix--
This &quot;Turbo&quot; air coming in--on the firewall side of the motor--really works--TWWM, uj
