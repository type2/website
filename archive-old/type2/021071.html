tough Bus Baby!!  The next Yuma show is set for November of this year--The next time I'm
bringing my bathing suit and a fishing pole--The setting along the river and shade of the
trees was Vantastic--Chad really came thru--Tell him thanks--OOps there was also Live

Man&quot; had a blast--Monday I'm under the knife and power saw--So this really will give me
pleasent VW dreams--TWWM, uj
