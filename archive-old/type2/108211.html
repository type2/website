&gt; &gt;  http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+77811.jpg
&gt; &gt;  Can someone please name this color for me so i can
&gt; &gt;  order some from my local paint supplier. Thanks!

&quot;Adriablau&quot;, or &quot;Adriatic (Sea) blue&quot;. It's the same color that a lot of
pool liners are painted.
I saw a can of Adriablau VW paint for sale on eBay not too long ago. There
was a can of that, and a can of Sealing Wax Red. Adriablau is my personal
favorite color for VWs and I have two that color...matching!
