Subject: Re:  roof insulation

&gt;I have been searching for an inexpensive way to insulate the roof of my
&gt;standard...
&gt;
&gt;The best one i have found so far is to use the foam pads that go under
&gt;carpet... it is 7/8 thick and very cheap... ($30 or so for a 6x14 foot
&gt;piece..)

Watch out; if there is *any* airspace between insulation and roof, moisture
will (eventually) collect there and it may rust.

Bob Hoover has a few sermons on insulating the bus.  Not inexpensively; his
approach involves wax paper and &quot;cow pies&quot; of urethane spray-foam.  The
urethane-based products are nice for this purpose because the curative
(isocyanate) reacts with water.  In fact, that's how some of them produce
the foam.  But this approach takes a LOT of cans of foam.

Something I plan to try:  attach styrene or urethane insulation -- cut to
contour -- using one of the new urethane isocyanate glues.  The glue is
pretty expensive ($8/12 oz bottle or thereabouts) but only a very thin layer
would be needed.  It too reacts with moisture, foams up slightly, and fills
cracks.  Trial and error on a not-bus will be required.

Last comment:  I'd rate Bob's sermons right up there with Muir and Bentley
as a must-have.
