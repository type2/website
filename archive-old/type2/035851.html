Subject: Happiness is ...

Happiness is finally tackling that big, nasty, rusty dent in the back of 
your bus that had your tail lights facing the same way as the sidelight. 
Pulling and hammering it out. Putting one thin layer of filler on after 
another and sanding in between. Finally getting to the last layer and 
sanding it smooth as a baby's behind. Spraying with primer and some more 
sanding and some spot putty and some more sanding.

And while waiting for each layer of filler or primer to dry, attacking a 
whole lot of lesser dents and rust spots.

And when all is done, looking in the teeny, tiny can of filler you bought 
at Pep Boys for $3.89 and seeing that you still have half a can left.
