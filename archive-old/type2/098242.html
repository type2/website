&gt; Are the original steel wheels for a '72 Bus and an '85 Vanagon the same?  I

&gt; Continental Contact CR21 - 185R14 for the Vanagon.  A quick check on
&gt; busdepot_dot_com indicates the same steel wheel part # for 71-91 Bus/Vanagon.  I
&gt; just wanted to double check this with the list before I swap them over.

Same wheel.  there might be a slight difference in the center hole, but it
does not affect usability.
