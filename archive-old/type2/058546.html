Hi everyone:

I have a 66 bus.  A few weeks ago, the accelerator cable broke.  No big deal,
I figured.  I've been owning and fixing buses for 30 years, and have replaced
many an accelerator cable.  But this time, it was different.  First
difference: When I pulled out the old cable, an extra piece of cable came out
-- I figure it was part of the cable-before-last.  I didn't give it much
thought at that moment, but it may be related to the actual problem, which is
that, when I tried pushing the new cable into the tube it wouldn't go all the
way through.   I tried about three times to get the cable to go all the way
through the tube, but it won't.  

Then I used the cable as a measuring tape.  I marked the place on the cable
which was as far as it would go in.  Then I pulled it out and stretched it
alongside the tube.  By that, I determined that the plugged up place is right
at the back end of the tube.  But there are two reasons why I can't get a look
at the back end of the tube to see what's plugging it up.  First, the
transmission's in the way  (Don't tell me to remove the engine and trans to
get a better look!) and second, there's a one-foot-long rubber tube on the end
of the long steel tube.  (I've never had a vdub that had this rubber tube
before; maybe they were installed in all models at the factory, but people
ripped 'em off or they fell off.)  I squeezed all around on the rubber tube to
see if I could feel anything inside of it.  It seems to be clear.  

As a stopgap measure, I have run the cable next to the tube, going through the
various holes in the frame members.  It's working OK for now, but I figure it
won't last long because the cable is exposed to the elements (I'm in Minnesota
where we have REAL KICKASS elements) so it will rust and because the cable is
gonna rub on too many places and eventually break from fatigue.  

So am a left with no alternative but to rip or cut off the rubber tube so I
can get a hook or some other kind of grabber thing into the end of the metal
tube so I can pull out whatever is plugging the tube?  (Maybe I'll find
another part of the cable-beore-last or maybe it's just a wad of dirty
grease.)  If there's a piece of cable in there, what works for reaching into
the tube and grabbing stuff.  Would it work if I tried pushing a clutch cable
through the tube from front to back, using it as a bull dozer to push out
whatever is in there?  

Finally, if I do cut off the rubber tube, does anyone think it's important to
put the cut-off part back on?  Maybe everyone sooner or later cuts off the
tube and doesn't replace it, and that's why I have never seen one of the
rubber tubes before.
