Subject: Re: Free parts

The free parts giveaway still continues, in part because several list
members who were 1st to ask for some of the parts have in turn failed to
follow through by making arrangements for shipping.  So, if you were the
2nd or 3rd in line to have asked for some of the parts you may yet still
get your chance.

Trip report:  Yesterday my '72 Westy and I drove 150 miles to Dallas and
while there had the chance to deliver some of the parts to list member
Keith Besterfeldt and meet his '69 Westy.
