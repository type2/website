  I have asked this before but will try again:  As I run through the gears
on
 my '82 Vanagon, I have started to get a very slight whine or moan from the
 gears or the transaxel that varies in pitch from one gear to to the next
but
 goes away when I reach 4th gear.   It doesn't sound unhealthy or even
 metallic....but it didn't used to be there.  Is this the sounds of wear?
 Tired gears?  Dry gears?   The beast runs fine, in any case.  Any thoughts?
 Cheers, Art
