Subject: [T2] What does the steering damper do ?

Dumb question, but I want to know the answer and can't find it in a book.

What does the horizontal shock absorber thing on the steering do ? I think
its the steering damper.

What happens if it's not working ? How long does it last ? I've never
replaced on one of either my bus or bug. Should I ?

Thanks
