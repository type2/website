Subject: Whicn Timing Notch?
Message-ID: &lt;19990623015925.52717.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I was trying to adjust the valve gap and the Timing of my bus but 
encountered this problem. There are three notches on the pulley, one which 
is by itself, another two very close together about 2 cm in the clockwise 
direction from the first one. My bus is a 70 model with a 1600 DP Mexican 
engine. the engine no has been distroyed so I can't provide any 
identification. Anyone there knows

1.which notch is the TDC?
2.Which notch should I use for the timing tunning with the strobe   light?
3.what gap size should i use for the valve clearance for both inlet and 
outlet?

Cheers
Mick-70 baja bus
