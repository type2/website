&gt; #1 cylinder is obvious...bad exhaust valve
&gt;
&gt; #2-#4 not so obvious to me....I can barely get the needle off of what
&gt; looks to be 100%.....why then would the compresion test on #3 look so bad?
&gt; #1 is sooo obvious.._dot_can feel it in the exhaust and it makes a lot of
&gt; hissing noise...the others seem very quiet...hardly any hissing at all.
&gt;
&gt; Comments/suggestions?

Dave,

I am nothing like an expert with leak-down tests.  It is something I have
always wanted to to but have not yet gotten the &quot;round tuit.&quot;  But my
guess on your 1/3 problem is that your cam may be worn.  The lifters for
both cylinders 1 &amp; 3 ride on the same lobes of the camshaft, so if they
are worn, you get the same problem on both sides of the engine.
Specifically, if your intake lobe is worn, then the duration of the
opening is not long enough for the cylinder to draw a full charge of
gas/air mix.  The check is to pull a lifter and have a look.  If you see
any obvious wear, then that is probably what is happening.
