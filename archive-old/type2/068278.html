Subject: RE: New Bus/Busses in movies

&gt;        It has a 2.0L engine and I am finding it a bitch to get started in
&gt;the morning. I have to
&gt;pump the gas like a bastard to get it going. Is this typical?

No.  At least not for my '78.
&gt;
&gt;        The function of the heater levers is a mystery. Can anyone tell me
&gt;what the 2 red and one
&gt;blue levers do?

The blue one controls the two 'fresh-air flaps' in the front.  Up is
closed, down is open.  Check and see if you have the little plastic piece
in between these two flaps- if you don't the blue lever only controls the
flap on the driver's side.  The red ones- I don't know what they do
separately, but down means you're getting heat.  Hopefully.  If you're
blower fan works, which mine DOES NOT!  This is maddening after spending
the last two warmish weekends insulating the rest of the car to maximize
heat and then realize that the blower fan is somehow broken- you realize
this, of course, when it's finally gotten too cold to stand being outside
to try to figure out what is wrong with it!
&gt;
&gt;        It has a standard transmission with an after market shift lever. I
&gt;think it is called
&gt;&quot;Scat&quot; but I am not sure. I have to lean forward to reach 1st and 3rd
&gt;because the lever is so
&gt;short. I don't know if it is shorter than the stock lever. Would it be a
&gt;mistake to put an
&gt;automatic in instead?

I think so.  But I will always drive manuals no matter what.  Yes, that
sounds shorter.  The stock shifter is about even with the emergency brake
in third- you sometimes pinch your fingers if you're not paying attention.

&gt;        Water gets in through the back door and soaks the cushion. Any
&gt;remedies?

Mone does that too.  Haven't figured out waht to do about it yet.  Not htat
bad, I just don't put anything valuable back there.
&gt;
&gt;        Both seats in front are in need of replacement. Any suggestions
&gt;for cheapest route?

I reupholstered mine.  I mean, I had it done.  I had the whole darn thing
done, panels and all- that was $400.
&gt;
&gt;        Do all of these busses have a hard time passing emissions?

Mine didn't.  Even with a pretty crusty muffler.  Up here in Wisconsin
(Ripon. sort of rural) I just figured out that you don't have to have
emmissions tested at all.  But I was looking forward to the time when my
car was exempt in florida anyway, so I'm happy.
&gt;
&gt;        Aside from the fairly minor repairs it needs, it was a fun to
&gt;drive it and my kids love it.
&gt;I don't know if I can bring myself to name it, but one never knows.

It'll get a name.  It deserves it.
