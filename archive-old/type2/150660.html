&amp;gt; I was just talking about a scale for home to weigh parts. Mailing off parts that are more closely matched in approximate weight rather than unknown weights would probably save a lot of time and money. For example the unknown piston that weighs 6g too much.

The Ohaus Scout 4000gx0.1g scale should do nicely, although one of those
Sartorius analytical balances would certainly make you the Alpha Geek in
