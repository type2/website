Subject: loow power

 
I'm running a bit underpower as of late. So is the van.
 
#2 on my 2L is fouling out. I pulled the plug wire while
it was running with no noticeable rpm loss. I tried a different
distributor cap, spark plug wire, and new plugs with no change.

 
I just adjusted my valves 900 miles ago. Could they possibly have come
out
of adjustment and are somehow causing the fouling? (or rather, causing
other problems
that lead to fouling) 
 
what other things should I be looking for? I'm basically running on 3
cylinders. It has
to be something fairly recent. It was running fine a couple of weeks
ago.

so, once it stops snowing, I'm going to check out my valve clearances.
Hopefully that will
be the issue. Wintertime mechanics generally find themselves ranked as
&quot;unpleasant&quot; in my book.

take care all
matt
