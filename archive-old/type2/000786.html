        Listees:

               A month ago I enquired on the List about a rear facing single
seat for my
73 Westy. The PO had installed a homemade stove in place of the seat, and it
was my turn to find another.
               I received a reply from Karl von Salzen who said he knew
where one was at a wreckers in California and would retrieve it for me .
It also happens Karl was sending a bus to Canada for Dennis Jolliffe and he
would throw
in the seat.
              I contacted Den and today we met as he was bringing his &quot;New&quot;
bus home.
Got the seat and installed it today and it looks great!
              Just wanted to thank Karl and Den for their help and to say
that this List is the greatest resource a bus lover could want!
