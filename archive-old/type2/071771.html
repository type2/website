Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

they may be the cheepest but ive found also the slowest, i have items 
backordered with them for probably a month right now. If you want something 
fast, go to your local vw dealer, they havent failed to get me a part the 
next day, but they charged me 6.95 for that little nut that holds your clutch 
cable, which the bus depot sells for .65 cents, then again i needed it NOW. 
RMMW is in the middle somewhere, Everyone else dosent have near the selection 
of those 3, I usualy only order from them. Dont worry, Ron and the crew will 
get it to you.
