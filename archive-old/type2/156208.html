Subject: water pump

Ok I will try to explain this better this time...
  I am trying to get my sink pump to work.  I have confirmed power.  The pump has two wires coming from it (red and black).  One wire goes directly to the button beside the faucet (there is an inline fuse as well)  The other wire is not attached to anything.  Does this wire go to the power?  The last mystery is that there are two wires coming our of the button beside the faucet, one is attached to the pump (as described above) , the other is attached to nothing.  Any thoughts on what to do?
   
  Thanks
  Jeff
