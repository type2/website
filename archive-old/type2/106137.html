Subject: Re: [T2] Silver socket wattage

&gt; I believe Richard said he had a 12v outlet NEXT to the 120V box.

Yes, the Canadian setup is different apparently: The circuit breaker has no
built-in sockets and there is an extra cigarette lighter.

Based on my m-plate and the final delivery destination, I believe all Westys
regardless of final destination were imported into Quebec where anything
regulated by Canadian standards (radio, electrical wiring, propane stove)
were locally installed with local components.
 
&gt;&gt; what's weird about page 9 is the 3 bulb flourecent light, that was only
&gt; on euro models.
&gt; 
&gt; It came on USA 79 models. Perhaps this was a late-78 printing of the manual?

I also have the 3-bulb florescent lamp (CDN model).

I took a peek behind the dash. It looks like the silver socket is wired to
terminal 30 on the hazard switch (un-fused) by 16 awg wire. Would 100W be
safe then? It seems most of the motorcycle clothing max. out at 50W.

I searched the archives and Steve Dolan suggested using an existing cut-out
in the dash to putin a US lighter socket. I checked and I can see it but the
hole needs to be widened.

Any idea what accessory switch went in this location? Ambulance light or fan
maybe?

In my searching I also found Jamie River's page that shows the spare tire
and inflator:
