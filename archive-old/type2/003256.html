My '73 stalls at idle when the headlights and/or heater are on.  It just slowly dies.  Everything is set within specs.  I can't find a vacuum leak.  #1 is down to about 80 psi and little difference is noticed at idle when I disconnect that plug wire, could this be it?  It will idle if I kick it up to about 1500 rpm and some difference is noted when I pull #1 wire.  All carb electric's work and there is enough fuel.

The archive did not help with this one.  Maybe someone has had this exasperating problem and can help.

Thanks,

Ian
