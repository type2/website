Subject: [T2] alternator getting too hot? 

Sounds like a fuel problem to me also, runs good for a
while, shuts down or slowes down, cut it off for a
while and it runs good again---never heard of a
alternator overheating unless a bearing burnt up in
it. Got to be fuel related, tank blockage, filter,
motor, lines. Put a pressure gage on it and check it
when it slowes down, bet its got low pressure. Phil
