Subject: Re: truck bed liners

&gt;but as for what you put the truck lining on, it is truly 
&gt;inpervious.....w/o air it wont rust.
&gt;
&gt;i think you have a good idea here,  that stuff is very durable and easy to 
&gt;work with.  (it is a good business to be in,  low set-up costs, easy to 
&gt;learn, lots and lots of potential)

Just be sure to get it sprayed in the right place the first time. My buddy 
Wade told me of one deal where the customer remembered after the fact that 
he needed some of the truck bed to remain uncoated for some welding and 
they had to take some of it up. Requires chisels and grinders. &lt;grin&gt;
