Not being familiar w/the '72, please take w/a complete saltlick.  Are you 
certain these fumes are entering via the heating sysem?  To ensure your 
safety, it would be wise to go over all of your fuel line, especially 
out-of-sight sections (like where line passes through engine tin, etc.) and 
clamped connections.  Do you have a gas heater?  If so, is fuel supply 
route/lines good to go?  Make certain that the smell you're encountering is 
(hopefully) coming from exchanger refuse, and not fuel squirting out 
somewhere (around a clamp on a dried-out hose, maybe?) and running into your 
exchanger(s) or somehow sending vapors into the cab.

Yes, the blinking msg. found _at_ the bottom of the type2 site seems to make an 
impression (&quot;Busses are prone fire,&quot; then &quot;replace your fuel lines now!,&quot; I 
believe it blinks; not to mention the mess made by a not-so-tight line off 
of the pressure regulator, which rinsed a goodly amount of my hi-temp paint 
off of the intake manifold).

Ciao,

I have a 72 bus that I just got about a week ago...

...Also I smell gas fumes in the bus.  I know this is coming from the
heating system but If someone could tell me where a commmon place to look 
for
this problem would be.   Thank You
