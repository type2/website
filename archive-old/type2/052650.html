And I quote from the Type2 and Vintagebus Charters:

States copyright law (and by treaty with many other countries), messages
posted to this list are copyrighted with all rights reserved by their
respective authors. The administrator of this list makes no claim to

neither should anybody else.

However, cross-posting is common on the Net whether it is authorized

be entered into at least two publicly accessible archives, where it 
will remain permanently. If you don't like the possibility of your 
words being cross-posted or archived, then don't post messages. 

Any questions? RTFM!
