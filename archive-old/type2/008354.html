Subject: Pressure washing?
Date: Tue, 16 Feb 1999 00:11:49 -0800

Hi folks,
          I am wondering if anyone would care to offer their opinions on
pressure washing the underside of my 2.0L FI engine?    Is this not such
a good idea to remove grease, oil, and road dirt?  If not done right, can
I take off my undercoating?  Should certain areas be covered or not hit
with the spray, or maybe just a low psi rate?  Or should I just buy a
couple cans of Gunk......spray it on, and hose it off?  I'm toying with
this idea, since I have access to a PW, but don't want to even start if
it can lead to unforeseen problems.  Yea or nea?
                          Thanks,       Kevin  Snow
