Subject: Heating blower and or recirculation system.

I have recently bought a '79 type 2 camper bus.  I've searched different sites looking for a way to install a heater blower and or recirculation system.  My standard heating system does not have provision for blowing (hot) air at standstill into the interior (cab).  I did come accross various mentions of systems but nothing definite and not a lot about where excatly where to connect up to.  
Here's some questions:
For recirculation, would it be just a matter of blowing air from the interior of the bus by ducting into the engine compartment or do you have to connect the ducting to the heat exchanger(s)?  If so how and where abouts to connect?
For pumped air, (blower system) Is it possible to connect an inline blower in the stock system?  Do you know of any Kits available in the UK?  I've heard mention of an Atwood 3&quot; Turbo bilge blower, are these good and are they available in the UK?  Any help or ideas at all would be most wellcome.
