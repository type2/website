Subject: Re:Oregon Performance Products and California Imports

ya

for my money - the attack and defence of OPR is what makes this list
great - it
really helps people like me in finding out about retailers and buses in
general -
to paraphrase madison - plurality is the thing (boy those lawyers are
smart hey) -

another point - ive ordered parts from California Imports in Burnaby -
one of
those was an outrigger - so they send it to me - i take it out to my bus

line it
up beside the front one - it looks a little short - i hold it against
the
back one
- it seems right - so i measure it and go call CI and tell em that this
seems
wrong - they say measure it - so i did and told them the measurement -
they say it
is the right one - so i say ok - couple weeks later my welder buddy
comes
over we
start to remove the rockers and all sorts of pieces blah, blah, blah, -
so it
comes time to put on the outrigger - of course it is the wrong one - it
is the
rear - so i call CI and tell them - we go through the measurement thing
again - i
tell him: &quot;look, i have a bus in my yard, ive measured both front are
rear
outriggers this one is definitely for the rear&quot; he says no if it is that

long then
it is the front - he very politely tells me that i don't know how to
read
a
measuring tape  - finally i just say: &quot;ok, send me the one you guys have

that is
marked rear, and i'll put that on the front&quot; - which i did and it fit
perfectly -
i was p'd off - my point - lots of support from CI - they have a bunch
of
pleasant
people who spend all day on the phone - the are polite, courteous etc..
-
all that
really doesn't help me - im still stuck with a part i don't need  - i
could send
it back but they have this restocking charge (25% i think) and they
refused to
admit they were wrong so .... and i was down for about a week because
they swore
they sold me the right part when i called the first time

what exactly is customer service - did i get great customer service from

CI - i
was the obnoxious customer and the whole time the phone people were very

nice?
