Subject: About to buy a '78: Potential Probs?

I am considering buying a '78 conversion camper. It has a 2.0 litre, 
hydraulic vavles, and has 80,000 miles. (is there any way to know for 
sure it doesn't really have 180,00 miles?) I would like to know if there 
are any problems that '78 buses are known to have. I have been warned 
about the exhaust pipes being specific to this year. Anything else I 
should know before I buy it? Thanks for the help.
                                                            Simon
