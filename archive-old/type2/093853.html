Subject: Re: [T2] muffler installation

Hi Glen,

Put the new sealing rings onto the ends of the heat exchanger before you begin to fit the muffler. (cuz you cant do it afterwards!!!)

When fitting the muffler you have the two pipes, 4 studs and four bolts to get lined up, and (my experience is) that they won't all line up easily.

So just put each nut onto its stud and each bolt into its captive nut for just a turn or two. This will give you some play in order to get the last one started. Then once every thing is started you can tighten it all up.

Also double check that the heat exchangers pipes are located into the muffler before tightning up or you will just have to loosen it all off again...

Good luck
