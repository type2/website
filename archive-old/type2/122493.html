&gt; I must say though, that steps 11-14 are not necessary. I never take any of
&gt; those parts off the engine, except the coil. You have to remove the two
&gt; bolts that hold the transmission bell housing to the upper trans mounts on
&gt; the frame, as well as disconnecting the shift rod from the transmission.
&gt; Then the entire engine/trans assembly will pivot downward and then the
&gt; engine will slide off the trans easily. Food for thought.

I smell another article: in 15 easier steps!

This is the third time I've had the engine out and I've been doing it the
way I was shown. I mentioned the difficulty in the article but I've been
less adventurous with the combined drop without having seen it done.

At what angle is the engine when it slides off the transmission (this might
be easier with a simple jack that the atv jack)? Exactly how do you support
the transmission in the angled position?
