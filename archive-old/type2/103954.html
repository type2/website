&lt;&lt;  Don't laugh...As late as '62 MGA's had a hole in the bumper and a

I wonder if the German military had cranks in their VWs?  The military
tends to keep redundant systems around longer than the commercial sector.

That was my '60 MGA that I had experience with using the hand crank to
start it...My advice...Find a hill and bump-start it. The crank did work e-
ventually, but watch that thumb you've grown accustomed to having a-
round. Even with the one-way slot on the crank pulley the crank can snap
back if the engine kicks back on compression....Obviously hand cranks
on engines predated liability lawyers...;-(
