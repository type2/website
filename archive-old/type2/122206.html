Subject: Re: [T2] Ring Compressor needed

Thanks, Dave.

I ran out to the garage and tried it on a test P&amp;C (one that is on my 
workbench) and it works like a charm...

&gt;I'll tell you what I used and cost very little. A 3 inch hose clamp. It was 
&gt;just wide enough to cover
&gt;all the rings. I kept it just loose enough so when I tapped the cylinder 
&gt;over the piston lightly it
&gt;would slide right off. Worked like a dream.
