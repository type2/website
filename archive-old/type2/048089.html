Subject: Re: [T2] Jump Starts and Turn Signals

&gt; &gt; question is: Can my FI bus just not receive jumpstarts, or I am not to
give
&gt; &gt; them either?

I too have been paranoid about the jump start thing, but have jump started
and been jump started lots of times with no problems..  I don't know
anything
about the phenomenon but it seems flaky that VW engineers wouldn't protect
their ECU from voltage spikes coming from alternators or starters or
whatever..
Now I even charge my battery with a wall plug charger without disconnecting
the battery (I'm waiting for my new alternator...).
