Subject: tools

I've pulled wrenches professionally since 1961.  IMHO the best tools I can
buy are a justified business investment.  Snap-On quality pays for itself
many times over.  However, (there's always a however, isn't there), &quot;good&quot;
quality tools, as opposed to &quot;best&quot;, probably make more sense for most
casual mechanics.  To a professional technician time is money.  Most of us
work on a straight commission basis.  If I can complete a job more quickly
by using better tools I make more money, and I CAN work faster with better
tools.  Once upon a time a young technician working next to me rounded off
the head of a nut using a Craftsman end wrench.  The fastener was difficult
to reach and a box end wouldn't get on it.  I was able to remove the rounded
off nut with a Snap-On end wrench.  Time is money!  But Snap-On tools are
VERY expensive,  if you have more time than money then &quot;good&quot; quality tools,
like Craftsman, Mac, Etc, are okay.  No flames please.  I know technicians
who swear by their (insert favorite brand here) tools.  They often state
that they are &quot;just as good as Snap-On&quot;, and maybe they are.  There are
exceptions of course.  1/2&quot; drive impacts, for example.  Give me
Ingersoll-Rand any day.  In 3/8&quot; drive impacts, Snap-On still rules.  The
same with air ratchets, Snap-Ons' high power 3/8&quot; air ratchet will turn
almost anything I can get it on, within reason.  The cheap ones work pretty
good.  The really cheap stuff is better than nothing but just barely.  So I
guess what I'm saying is &quot;Buy the best you can afford, it's much cheaper in
the long run.  You almost always get what you pay for.&quot;

Lots of Old VWs.
Lots of Snap-On tools too.
