Subject: Re: [T2] heater boxes / part question

Touching asbestos is not the issue......inhaling the fibers
is.........however such a small amount of contact is not going to hurt
anyone.  people that worked with asbestos were exposed to it over time
before they got cancer.

&gt; Chris,
&gt;
&gt; I wouldn't be messing around with those &quot;paper tubes&quot; with my
&gt; bare hands if I were you - I did it myself 'till I read somewhere that
&gt; those were made of asbestos - and that material, as you know is
&gt; prone to cause cancer. At the time the buses were assembled it
&gt; was the best heat isolating material around and it's downside
&gt; wasn't yet on the public view. Use a mask too if you're working
&gt; directly under the bus.
&gt;
&gt; I hope I'm not being too paranoid here!
&gt; Greets to all you guys!
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I have been searching for whatever keeps my stock heat from really
working
&gt; &gt; the way I have heard
&gt; &gt; others report it can if everything is both there and connected
correctly. I
&gt; &gt; replaced those paper tubes and insulated them the best I could, they
connect
&gt; &gt; down to the heater boxes nice and tightly, but when I pulled the heat
sheild
&gt; &gt; from the bottom of the motor to continue following them, that metal pipe
&gt; &gt; that goes from the heater boxes to the next metal pipe (the part exactly
&gt; &gt; underneath the heat sheild) I found these two (on both sides, they
appear to
&gt; &gt; be exactly the same) pipes to be rather crumbly. There is not any large
&gt; &gt; gaping holes in them, but I am pretty sure if I poked it with my finger
hard
&gt; &gt; enough I could punch a hole right through with little to no effort. If I
&gt; &gt; touch them, rust/dust falls from them. In my tracing of this issue, this
&gt; &gt; appears to be the only major weak link (starting from the back, moving
&gt; &gt; forward anyway. I havent removed the guard under the front of the bus to
&gt; &gt; check those connections yet where the heat must travel up into the cab).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, are these pieces known as something in particular, if I was able to
&gt; &gt; order them from someone? Or any suggestions on how to fix
them/workaround
&gt; &gt; replacements for this section?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It has been raining here in SF the past few days and really cold sitting
in
&gt; &gt; traffic for an hour just because ppl leave their brains at home when it
gets
&gt; &gt; a little wet out. I would hate to see a lot of them try and drive back
in
&gt; &gt; Wisconsin in the middle of winter. Then again, maybe thier suv's would
&gt; &gt; finally have some kind of justification. (maybe!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help you can pass along....
