Subject: Front Shocks Late Bay

Ordering some shocks today from Bus Depot.
Info that I have gleaned from several sources indicate that the Boge
shocks are the intended 'stock' ride.

I have also heard that the KYB Gas adjusts were more stable but
rather stiff.

KYB GR2's, I have heard, are not as soft as the Boge but not as
stiff as the Gas Adjustables either.

Is this correct?  or have I been misinformed?
