Great.  Hope the dude can make use of it. My first bus was given to me - 75
camper. learned what NOT to do to a type4 engine on that one.

last night I witnessed a scene that reinforced my belief that VW Bus people
are about the best people on earth.  I was at a local Blitzkrieg club
meeting, which is actually more like a bunch of people hanging out in the
same parking lot every Thursday night, and learned that one of the regulars
had become homeless that day and had also lost out on a promising job
opportunity.  At some point a late '70s camper showed up that nobody had
ever seen before and most of us just went back to jawing with our friends.
All of a sudden an emotional scene developed near by as our homeless buddy,
now in tears holding the pink slip, had just been GIVEN the Bus.  It is
currently registered but with an engine that won't pass smog so it seemed of
limited value to the original owner but he wanted it to go to a good home
and was able to help someone out of a bad situation.
