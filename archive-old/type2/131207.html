Subject: eureka / arcata / mckinlyville?

Sorry to get a little off topic, but im wondering if any of you fine
folks out there live in this area?

My wife and I are looking at moving here after the new year (literally,
not a fun move) and id like to get an idea of how many other vanagon
listmembers from this area are out there, and maybe pick your brian just
a bit.

If you are out there, im just looking for some community type message
boards, so I can get an idea of what its really like to live on a day to
day basis in that area. We have visited a few times, and love the
surrounding area (no duh right) - but as we get closer, id like to get a
better idea of, well, day to day life and community issues.

thanks for any responses, tips, suggestions, or tomfoolery.

thankfully, we wont have to deal with another full blown winter at -20
this year.
