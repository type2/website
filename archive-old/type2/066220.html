&gt; &gt;  I keep meaning to ask about the name &quot;Grendel&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  It's from mythology as I recall. Anyone got a &quot;good&quot; encyclopedia?
&gt; 
&gt; Grendel is the mythical beast that is Beowulf's nemesis. Beowulf persues 
&gt; Grendel down into its (do I vaguely remember 'her'?) lair and does it in.
&gt; 
&gt; More recently, there is a book called 'Grendel' (don't remember the 
&gt; author) written from the beast's perspective.


Then doesn't Beowolf get it from someone else later?  I think he is killed
too.  The setting is called Heorot, not sure if that's a city/country or
what.
