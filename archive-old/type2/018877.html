Subject: Aux blower fan wanted
Message-ID: &lt;37F94F2A.ACB33C50_at_mgl_dot_ca&gt;

Hola Bus fans...

Searched the archives, but didn't find the manufacturers name for this
one...I'm thinking Keep Kool, but can't find them in the mags any more
either...

I know many folks use the 3&quot; boat exhaust bilge blowers, but I want to
try the aux blower kit that I won't have to reduce the pipe to fit it
up...

Anyone have details on this one, or know where it's from??

Thanks for any help...

Den.
