Have you tried distributor grease?  I believe it resists 
melting/running when it gets warm.  You have mentioned that lovely So 
Cal late summer heat frequently on the list the last couple of weeks 
(and I was just down in LA last weekend, and can confirm it was pretty 
darn hot :-)

Also, are you absolutely sure that it's the rubbing block wearing down, 
and not the points slipping on the plate?  Could be vibration working 
the screw loose.  Make sure you tighten that screw well, and maybe put 
a dab of blue Loctite on it.

&gt; I don't know what else to try short of dropping $60+ on a pertronix.
&gt; This has happened on both my original 009 and the vac dizzy Karl sent
&gt; me. This is my 3rd set of points now... At $15 a pop I'm close to a
&gt; pertronix anyway. :-(

Of course, I'll always advocate for going to Pertronix... but why are 
you spending $15 for a set of points?  Or is that with a condenser?  
For just points, that seems ... excessive.  Seems to me it should be 
more like $10-$15 for points *and* condenser.  Where are you buying 
them?
