My Westfalia has 256 K on it, the previous owner kept meticulous
maintenance records (a genuine rocket scientist, I still have his
Association decal on my rear window) I haven't found any record of
replacement of the rear wheel bearings and each time I've put my van on
jack stands and run the drive wheels I find that the bearings are very
silent (I'd expect this with no-load conditions). I've also got his 12
year log on fuel use and travel destinations with fuel mileage on each
trip. Nothing slipped past this guy until a VW dealer stuck it to him on
a Canadian VW factory rebuilt engine at 145K, $2700.00 in 1994. I got it
after he cast off VW Dealerships and started getting repairs done by
about eight different no-nothing repair shops that vacuumed his wallet
very professionally.
