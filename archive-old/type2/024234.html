Subject: Burning rubber smell?

--part1_7e.19f754cf.28bf15b6_boundary

Let me describe the situation and get some feedback. I've driven my Westy 
twice now where I smell what smells like burning rubber. No idiot lights come 
on, it runs great, there's just this smell. Here's what I'm wondering. I'm a 
newbie. Took my bus to a guy in our VW Club who is supposedly very 
knowledgeable who taught me how to adjust my valves. When we finished he 
checked my generator belt and said &quot;it's a little loose. Let me show you how 
to tighten it&quot;. I knew how to do this, but thought I'd   
observe anyway. I'd never moved the shims, so this was good practice. I felt 
that there was only a 1/2 inch play beforehand however, and when he was 
finished I thought if a 1/2 inch is what we need, then this is too tight, but 
this guy is light years ahead of me, so what do I know? Do you think the belt 
is too tight and this is what I'm smelling? If so, should I loosen it? Can 
this hurt anything? My gut feeling is that it won't hurt anything, but it 
might wear the belt out at a quicker rate, but then again, I'm a 
&quot;non-mechanically inclined newbie&quot;
