Subject: Re: [T2] Westy pop-top ceiling fuzz?

Before I forget, I just wanted to post the outcome in
case anyone searches in future. Basically, I was
having a hard time getting the insulating flocking off
the inside of my Westy pop-top. What I did in the end
was to paint it with interior house primer, let it
dry, then power sand it with 40-grit paper. I then
primed/dried &amp; sanded a second time, and it was pretty
smooth by then. After that, I gave it 2 top-coats of
interior house paint, put the top back on the bus and
fitted the canvas.

In retrospect, I wish I'd used more-durable paint
(maybe the fiberglass epoxy I used for the outside),
but hey - shoulda-woulda-coulda. maybe next time :-)

Also, another difficulty I had was that the new
&quot;canvas&quot; (actually one of the synthetic waterproof
tents) wasn't tall enough at the front to allow me to
double it over the staple strip at the top edge. The
sides and back were plenty tall enough though. I'm
sure I could have returned it, but was under pressure
to fit it in time for vacation, so I ended up
re-drilling holes in the lower front-leg brackets, and
thus lowering the front edge by about 3/4&quot;. If anyone
else is ever considering doing this, make sure you
drill the brackets (either bottom or top), not the
legs, since drilling the legs would mess up their
relative dimensions when folded, unless you drill new
holes at both ends.

Happy camping
