Subject: engine tin placement

does anyone have a pic. of the tin, in place, that goes around the
alt. on a 75 or later bus engine?  i cannot figure this out.  put the
engine back in on sat. and today put some more tin and misc. parts on
but this piece has me stumped.  i took pictures of the FI stuff so i'd
know where it all went when i put it back together but i failed to
shoot the underside of the bus to do the same.  i probably will not be
able to understand if  you try to explain how this piece goes in.  i'm
so smart that way, so if you have a pic. or know where any are please
let me know.


TIA,

jeremiah
