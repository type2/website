Can we kill this thread?  i personally don't think the basics of how to drive a
car are worth 50 posts of discussion.  I guess a bus is a car so it's somewhat
relevant but i think the original question has been answered more than
adequately... .. Though we could start a thread and try to figure out just what
this whole clutch thing is all about.  Why does my bus have three peddles, and i
have this strange stick thing in the middle of the front floor, what could this
mysterious thing be?   ;-)
