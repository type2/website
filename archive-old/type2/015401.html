&gt;&gt; I assume since my 79' westy has a weber carb, that the
&gt;&gt; feul pump was changed also in the prcess. so will I
&gt;&gt; have to find a factory feul pump, when I switch back
&gt;&gt; to F.I.?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, and they're about $200.00. I purchased a used FI last year. Apart from
&gt;the fact that the Weber runs pretty good, this has been the main reason for
&gt;not converting.

Stick with stock and it will be easy to install and function as intended.
Get a junk yard candidate fer cheap. Campbell-Nelson will have a bunch as
will other yards who salvage VW's. You would be amazed how many 20 year old
original parts are still functioning to spec.  If it doesn't work, send it
back and they no doubt will send you another.  

That's just the objective of my need for simplicity and function, and all
at the same, harmonious, long time. Objectives vary as to individuals
unless they accept the original design objectives of they who designed and
built it. That's a systematic approach to what is &quot;best&quot;. Those of the
subjective approach must design the swap themselves to function as they
deem &quot;best&quot; or suffer functional problems, therefore, lost value. If
time/money has to fit under your &quot;best&quot; umbrella, stock is the only logical
choice.
