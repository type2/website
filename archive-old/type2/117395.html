&gt; I had a white plastic rubbing block BREAK on me a week ago Friday (of 
&gt; course, June 13, Friday the thirteenth!!) and I got stranded on I-495 
&gt; Washingto DC beltway on the way to work .

bout time to break down and put Pertronix in the green bus....

&gt; And let me tell you, when it breaks, your are INSTANTLY dead in the water, 
&gt; coasting  at 60 mph, looking for a break-down shoulder..

tell me about it, in the rain at night usually

&gt; I only want about 10, if they are any good, and I won't know that until 
&gt; after I buy them and try them out.  Changing points every 10k miles is my 
&gt; thought.

never changing points again is my goal

&gt; If anyone is interested in trying the points with me, I would resell them to 
&gt; you at $10/10 + actual mailing costs.  (I will buy the envelopes...)

if you come up short in getting enough takers I'll help you out with 10,
I have used more points helping stranded VW's on the side of the road than
on my bus so I'll keep em in the bus for emergencies
