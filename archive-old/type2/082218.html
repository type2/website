Subject: Cooking the Roll----


Now here is something I just was reminded of--and I want to know, if
anyone else has ever heard of or seen one of these unit's---

Waaay back when, I remember seeing  box, that hung off the back bumper,
of a car, pickup, van, bus, and it attached to the tail pipe of said
vehicle, and it cooked your food, baked a cake, roasted a pot roast,
whatever---

It had an inner oven, and an outer shell, that the exhaust passed
through and cooked your groceries as you drove---

Yea, I'm nuts--but I do remember these gizmo's--anyone else remember
something like this?

Later,

Chef Francois Pope
