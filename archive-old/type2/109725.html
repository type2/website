Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Is there such a thing as a flat clear coat?

Courtney,

No--not the clear by itself--

But there is such a thing as a flatting agent that can be added to the
clear to dull it out--

Available at any better body shop supply depot's--

Make sure the clear is compatible with the stuff you blew on the
tank--or it will lift or craze it.

Later,

Terry

I have painted my motorcycle tank and some parts on my VW bug flat black
and want to protect them. Is there such a thing as a flat clear coat, so
the flat black is protected but doesn't become shiny?? Courtney
