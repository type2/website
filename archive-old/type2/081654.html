Subject: Re: [T2] braking with your engine?

I have two responses.
 1st , I have rear ended some one in my type 2 , a pretty rusty type2 to
also. the nose was caved in and the A pillars took a hit bending the
doglegs. That truck took a hard hit and I came out fine , only a sore wrist
from they way I clenched the steering wheel. I was also wearing an over the
shoulder belt.  I guarantee that click and clack have never been in an
accident in a Type 2 , they don't know the facts so they shouldn't talk out
of there A**.

Second, I lived in the Smokey mountains for a while, Its just horrible in a
bus to have to go up and down those steep roads. When going down hill , I
would down shift on the straight-aways and then break hard before the turn.
I never had a problem overheating the brakes and it always worked well.

later- Bryan
