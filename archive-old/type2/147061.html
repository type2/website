Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Canucks! + Candied
  Yams for Tony :-)

 Many thanks Jerry for the history lesson, and the Happy Thanksgiving. I did
indeed enjoy a great dinner created by my wife, Turkey, brussel sprouts,
glazed parnsips, stuffing, cranberry sauce, roasted potatoes, mixed carrots
and peas, and for Tony - A Canuck version of candied yams!! (Maybe not
Canuck, but def. delicious).



Cook your yams up (about 2-3 lbs) until they can be mashed.

Add about 1 generous Tb of fresh ground ginger (not powder)

Add about 1 generous Tb of dark brown sugar (or more to taste)

Add a splash of port or sherry (about 4 Tb should do it, or to taste)



Enjoy ginger mashed yams, you will love them, they are always fought over in
my house.



And here's an early Thanksgiving wish to my American friends and allies in
these tough times worldwide.



Blessings to all,



Courtney

&gt; Nice try, but no candied yam...First Thanksgiving declared by George

&gt; Washington on Nov. 26, 1789...First Thanksgiving in Canada on April

&gt; 5, 1872...By my calculations, you're only 83 years late...

 

Hi Courtney and Tony (or Euell?),

 

I recently transplanted myself from the States to Canada and so had ocassion
to look up the history of &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;. I'd like to toss into the mix that
the first North American &quot;thanksgiving&quot; celebration was celebrated by
Frobisher in Newfoundland in 1578, which puts him before even the Pilgrims.
Of course, there was no concept of &quot;Canada&quot; then, or the &quot;United States&quot;
either, so someone is going to argue that it doesn't count.

 

First, last, or also ran, I had a turkey dinner today, and it was darn good.
I hope you did too, Courtney. And you too, Tony, when the time comes and if
you're not watching football.

 

See you on the road,

Jerry

Galiano Island, BC
