Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact

&gt; 	IMHO, there is nothing worse than spending bags o' dollars on
&gt; something which turns out to NOT solve the problem.  Optimize what you got
&gt; with proper cabling and a better VR, and if that don't get it for you, THEN

Details please! I've been chasing charging demons since I got my bus. Last
fall I replaced my alternator, battery, and tried three VRs and still don't
seem to get proper charging. It's OK as long as I drive 50 miles at a time -
but around town I occasionally have to get a jump.

I've cleaned my grounds until I could see my reflection in the metal. What I
haven't done (yet!) is replace the ground straps (which seem fine - no
fraying) or replace the wiring harness between the alternator, starter and VR.

I'm about to embark on a major overhaul of the organization of my charging
system. I'm going to install a deep-cycle aux battery with the Hella kit and
run just the headlights (using a relay kit and new wiring) and starter off the
regular battery. I'm considering moving both batteries under the passenger
seat in the back too.

Any input would be appreciated!

-Eric

P.S. Thanks everyone for the input on the FRS radios. Seems to be the best bet
is to buy the cheapest set I can find. Avoid GMRS. And spend a little extra
for the boom-mike for hands-free operation.
