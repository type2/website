Subject: horn not beeping, help
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, i reattached the wires to my horn last night, and nevertheless, it 
still doesn't beep!  i tried to run power directly to the horn (via a spare 
battery) and still no go.  my better half checked the switch (i tried to 
beep, while he used a &quot;gizmo&quot; at the wires under the bus) and still...no dice!

originally, i thought the horn was disconnected by the PO due to a 
short...beeping all by itself, but since the wires are connected under the 
bus now, i have no eye deer.

anyone run into this problem before?  the fuse is good, so i know i'm okay 
there!  i don't know what to check next.

last night, i attempted to dismantle the steering column to check for the 
ground wire...but, i couldn't get the d*mn horn cap off.  and of course, i 
couldn't find anything in my bentley about removing the cap.

also, will i have to remove the steering wheel to pull the driver's seat 
off of its rails or will i clear without its removal?

thanks everyone!!  i now have plates, but no inspection sticker.  i hope to 
be &quot;virginia road worthy&quot; in a few weeks....have fun at everybus!!
