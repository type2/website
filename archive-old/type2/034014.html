Chuck, I'm gonna slap you SOOOOOO hard! :-)

So far we've got four Davids in Colorado, at least two in Texas that I
know of, one from New Jersey who was the first post after mine
(bbbpppffffttt!), and the great H. Steve and Steve Ethridge (fellow
high-roof owner) in Chicago for starters.

You're just jealous that there aren't many Chucks. Thank god... :-)~

&gt; Nah, Nikki likes to limit the names of her significant others, less chance of
&gt; making the nasty name mistake =:-)
