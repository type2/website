Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition problems 80 vanagon

I'm familiar with the 180 degrees off routine (ask me how), and this time
it's not it. And I'm stumped. I made sure the drive gear is installed as per
Bentley, double-checked TDC according to valves and piston. Made sure rotor
is pointing to correct cylinder (#1), am getting good spark, set timing at 7
degrees BTDC while turning it over, Tried different coil. HT wires are going
where they should. If I wind it over and over eventually it will sort of
start very roughly with max RPMs at 2500, stinks like gas, and will stall if
I don't keep foot on gas. It doesn't matter now which combination of points
or dizzy I shove in there, won't go. Plugs are now sooty and black. Never
shoulda F**d with it I guess because it was running fine before I yanked the
dizzy.

I should also mention that I replaced all the short hoses to injectors
before changing dizzy, but no, I don't have injector wires crossed and I've
looked at them ten times and the injector plugs are in right, no gas leaks.
Triple-checked that I don't have any vacuum lines off, wire to cpu from coil
is attached, temp II wire still connected.

This is a simple engine so what the hell is going on?

&gt; Yup, this sounds like exactly what happened to Chris at Busted Bus recently
&gt; with a 78 Weekender. It will &quot;sort of&quot; run the way it is. Just turn the
&gt; drive gear 180 degrees and it should bingo. Don't bother with the plug wire
&gt; swap. Theoretically it will run with the wires reversed but you are right,
&gt; the vacuum can gets in the way. Keep the hot-spark though, it is worth it.
