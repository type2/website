Jason:

You are on the right track.  After you replace the wheel cylinder, I'd
suggest checking the other wheels for leaks and general condition as brakes
are kinda important don't you think?  Also, make sure you have the rear
brakes properly adjusted, otherwise your brake pedal will go too far down
before the brakes engage.  I'd also suggest draining all the brake fluid
from the system and replacing it with new DOT 4 (I think) fluid.  Who knows
how long the old fluid has been in there.
