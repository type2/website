Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Having never had the trans out of my bus, I didn't realize there was another
strap! This is EXACTLY the same as the strap on the 911! For some reason, I
was assuming there was another contact point between the engine and the
chassis and there wouldn't be the same strap.

The FAQ for older 911s pretty much starts off by suggesting a good sanding
of the firewall where the ground strap connects for 99% of your problems.
This kind of grounding makes for simpler electronics (i.e. one wire run
everywhere instead of two) but makes that ground connection critical!

&gt;&gt; Hmmm... The VERY FIRST thing I would do is take off the ground strap
&gt;&gt; from the battery and clean the bejezus off the body where the ground
&gt;&gt; strap attaches. And then clean the bejezus off the ground strap. Make
&gt;&gt; them so shiny you can see your reflection! And then do the same to the
&gt;&gt; negative post on the battery and the cable.
&gt;
&gt; *EXCELLENT* advice!  In addition, the one everyone neglects becasue it
&gt; is hidden is the trans to chassis strap.  The amazing thing is that
&gt; this is the only dedicated ground connection between the engine/trans
&gt; assembly and the body (and battery)!  look under the driver's side
&gt; toward the  front of the trans for a braided strap, like the OEM ground
&gt; strap to the battery.
&gt;
&gt; There are number of &quot;incidental&quot; paths, but the motor mounts on a bus
&gt; are all insulated by rubber shock bushings and if the trans ground
&gt; strap is not connected, funny things can happen.
