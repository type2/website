&gt;In the middle of an engine replacement my wire marking skills eroded.
&gt;Could anyone please give me a rundown on all the wires (by color) which
&gt;attach to the ignition coil on a 1978 van?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.

On the positive side: a black wire from the harness coming down from the heater fan [this harness should have 3 wires in it: blue to the oil sender, black to + on coil, and white to – on coil], a second black going to the in-line fuse on the left channel.
On the negative side: green fom the the distributor, white from the previous harness, and white from the grey covered injection harness [this is a single wire coming from the passenger side].
