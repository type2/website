Subject: Re: [T2] Awsome jack perfect for installing and uninstalling vw
   engines

Hey Karl,

I want to appoligize for the bad link. If I remember
correctly from the one that I looked at in my local
Sams store, it had casters on one side and wheels on
the other. The long arms on the side were just
stabilizers. I may be wrong but I think that is what I
remember.

I think that I like the transmission jack that George
mentioned better than this one for the fact that it is
cheeper, raises higher, and has less parts to get in
the way. Because of holiday spending, I will have to
put the jack on hold for now and just borrow my
grandfathers heavy duty hydrolic floor jack. I just
thought I would share my findings with the list.

Thanks again to everyone that replied! Sorry again for
the dead link. Have a great day and Happy Holiday
Shopping!

David Kelly

&gt; I looked at this style of jack at Harbor Freight.
&gt; This one appears to be the
&gt; same or close. I found the one at Harbor to be
&gt; worthless to use to r+r engines
&gt; since only one end has casters.
&gt; 
&gt; You have lift one end to move it. Once you put a
&gt; weight on it, it no longer is
&gt; moveable. If you look in the Samsclub pic, you will
&gt; see the supports on the
&gt; opposite end of the casters. [unless it has casters
&gt; I can't see.....]
