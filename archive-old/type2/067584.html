Subject: Re: Question about VW Things

Sorry to interject, but I was under the impression that the early things
used a transmission similar to a tunnel-type bus, with the reversed R&amp;P
and the reduction boxes on the axle ends.  Is this true?  Were these the
same as bus trannies.  I always thought they had different axle length.

I assume that the comparison to beetle transmissions must be for later
full IRS ones.
