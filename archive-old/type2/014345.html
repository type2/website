Subject: leaking gas (yes i know its bad)

This is on a 79 type2 micro. 2 liter. Anyway, All of the sudden I am
having a gas leak in the area of the firewall on the drivers side. I
first noticed it after filling up w/ gas. it was dripping from somewhere
I couldn't see. the fuel lines on this side of the tank seem dry. I can
see it very well at a piece of foam that is sticking out from behind the
firewall.

It goes away after sitting for a few minutes. I have tried to recreate
it by both running just the fi pump &amp; running the engine while sitting
still, but I cannot recreate the leak. The only thing which seems common
to both leaks is a hard right turn before turning off the engine. I have
needed to pull the engine to fix some oil leaks but now it seems that I
will have to pull the tank as well just to get some piece of mind.
Anyone know what might cause such a leak?
