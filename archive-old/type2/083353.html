&gt; This Spring, I pulled a 1600DP from my '71 Westy to rebuild it.
&gt; While doing the rebuild, I bought another 1600DP  from a fellow in
&gt; another state. I did a quick top end rebuild but used the flywheel
&gt; and clutch assembly that came with the second one.
&gt;
&gt; Today was to have been the big day to put this one into the bus. It
&gt; won't go.   It goes to within say 3/4&quot; of full mating with the bell
&gt; housing, but no further. No amount of wiggling the engine or rotating
&gt; the pulley would make it go.
&gt;
&gt; I rolled the engine back into the garage and compared the
&gt; flywheel/clutch assembly with the one from the original engine.  The
&gt; only difference I can see is that the original pressure plate is the
&gt; type that has  many fingers that contact the release bearing. The new
&gt; plate has a solid ring that evidently makes this contact.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest why I can't get the engine to mate?
&gt; Is the difference in pressure plates significant?

Yes!  you are mixing old and new style parts and they won't work together.
If you have the old style throwout bearing without the sleeve around the
transmission input shaft you need the plate with the ring.  If you have
the sleeve around the input shaft you need the plate without the ring.
many times these parts have been juggled between years, so it's the parts
thay your bus has that are important, not the year of the bus.
