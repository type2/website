&gt;I've been looking high and low for a piece of hose that will work to span the
&gt;gap between the decel valve and the plastic pipe that fits into the rubber Y
&gt;fitting at the intake plenum. This is for my 80 Vanagon. Tried using some 1/2
&gt;inch fuel line but it is quickly developing cracks at the ends that are
&gt;streached over the tubes at each end. I've checked Bus Depot ( couldn't find
&gt;it) and Bus Boys (NLA) with no luck. The tubes the hose has to fit over
&gt;measure 9/16 inch. Locally I can only find 1/2 inch (Too small) and 19/32 (too
&gt;big).

Is this hose the same as the baywindow version (c shaped with braided covering) ? The last time I was at the junkyard looking at a Vanagon I saw a slightly smaller rubber hose in that shape with no braid (part number clearly stamped on the outside so no braid from the beginning).

I forgot the part number and didn't take a photo. Does anyone know that original part number?
