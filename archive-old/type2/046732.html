Subject: [T2] Dropped spindles needed

I want to lower my '63 Sundial, (I know, I know).

I have found that the '63 actually had three different spindles used. My
dustcap covers the drum, does not fit into it. The only other way to tell, I
hear, is to measure the kingpin to see if it is 20mm or 22mm.

My problem is that everyone I have talked to so far wants my spindles as a
core. I don't want to give them up because I may want to go back to stock
one day. I want to keep my spindles, transaxle, reduction boxes and whatever
kept as a kit.

So, maybe there is somebody out there who has some well built '63 lowered
spindles that has already gone back to stock?
