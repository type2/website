&gt; &gt;This type 1 vs type 4 debate could go on and on,
&gt; You are right about that.
&gt; 
&gt; I hate hearing about people putting a type 1 engine in their bus when it was
&gt; &gt;meant for a type 4 thinking they are making an improvement.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry but I advocate it. I have seen way to many head failures on type 4 
&gt; engine, and have seen many folks drive thier busses 72 on with type 1 
&gt; engines with no problem.

I am a firm believer in the theory that if it came with a type I put a
type I back in it and if it came with a type IV no matter what model, put
a 2liter type IV in it...

&gt; &gt;If you've never experienced for yourself the rebuilding, driving, or owning
&gt; &gt;of a type 4 engined bus, please don't say these engines are expensive to
&gt; &gt;rebuild or no good, you are giving out hear-say and uneducated advice.

I've had both, and my old 60 23 window deluxe was the easiest to maintain
but my current 78 bay is by far the one I have kept the longest and drove
the furtherest.


but the bottom line for me, I live in a big city, and I can no longer
drive a stickshift, so it is real simple, only the type IV engine will
mate with the auto tranny (without more work than I want to do)  so

I'll keep my type IV running as long as I can, and as I have said before,
your bus, your decision

just keep em on the road
