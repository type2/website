Subject: Re: broken exhaust bolts

Hi Jim,

&gt; Is there a preferred way to remove them, other than dousing the hell out of
&gt; them with penetrating fluid and putting a visegrip on them? Am I
&gt; asking for trouble with my visegrip method?

The only thing I could add is grip it far enough down to be able to tap on the stud with a small ball peen hammer as you're turning it... the shock factor will both help the penetrating oil penetrate and help break it loose... much like the &quot;impact&quot; drivers I use on my bikes...  And don't &quot;reef&quot; on it right off - apply slow steady pressure.  The last thing you want to do is break off these already rusty and heat-stressed bolts (every one I have pulled had dhown crystalization at the point of breakage, so that told me just how fragile these bolts become over, say, 30-40 years of repeated hot and cold.

We use at my work (the San Francisco Oakland bay bridge, over salt water where rust not only never sleeps, it stays up on Peet's coffee and amphetamines!) a silicone oil based penetrating &quot;fluid&quot; (they don't call it oil, as I think it really has very little oil in it)called Silikroil.  It is the best I have *ever* seen, outdoes anything else we've tried (and we've tried it *all*) by a factor of at least 10... it's not cheap, but it is worth it's weight in platinum.  I have seen bolts not touched with 50 years of corrosion in them, and this stuff, done right, does the job.  NOTE:You cannot paint over it without cleaning whatever off very thoroughly, but with an exhaust bolt, why would you want to? 

Hugs,
