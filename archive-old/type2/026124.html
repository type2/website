This has just reminded me, someone wrote in the latest issue of 'Transporter
Talk' (UK VW type 2 owners club magazine) that VW have substantially reduced
the price of thousands of parts for older vehicles.  We are talking in the
region of half price here on a lot of genuine VW items.  I don't know if
this applies to the whole world or not, so don't get too excited, but it's
got to be worth a call to your local dealer to check.
