&gt; Here's a question for those who believe that the VW engineers
&gt; designed everything the best possible way, and it shouldn't be
changed.

An engineer who designs everything in the best possible way would work
for Ferrari or Lockheed, not VW.  VW engineers designed their vehicle
to be as inexpensive as possible while retaining reasonable
reliability.  If a part wasn't needed, they simply wouldn't put it in,
as it would raise the cost of the car.

Would VW spend all the money to install cooling flaps in millions of
cars if the flaps weren't needed?  Nope!  Would VW spend money to put
vacuum distributors in millions of cars if the cheaper 009 would work
as well?  Nope! Would VW go to the expense of designing fully sealed
engine bays on every vehicle they make just because they look cool?
Nope!

Yes, VW engineering can be improved upon, but not by stripping off the
systems that the engineers installed, because every one of these
systems were essential.  If they weren't, they wouldn't be there!
