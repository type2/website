&gt; &gt; Ok,,, seeing as the hills are far worse on the Left coast,, and the hills on the
&gt; &gt; right coast have skeerd me,, I will make sure I take extra brakes with me when I
&gt; &gt; finally make it out West.
&gt;
&gt; Jamie,
&gt;
&gt; Without disagreeing (extra brakes are *always* a good idea, if you can
&gt; figure out how to get them :-), there is really no difference between left
&gt; and right coast slopes!  The numbers tend to be much more impressive out
&gt; west, but the start altitude makes up for it most of the time.  A pass at
&gt; 9,000 feet sounds worse than a pass at 4,000 feet, until you realize that
&gt; in Denver you are already at 5,000 feet and you have to climb exactly the
&gt; same amount to reach either pass!

Well, Bishop California is at 4000 feet, and the pass above it pushes
8000, so that is a single 4000 foot climb.  If you want to stretch the
distance a bit, Death valley is below sea level, so you can easily do
8000 vertical feet on one tank of gas.

The other thing that western altitude saps is engine power.  At 8000 feet,
we all have 36hp buses!
