Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bus for sale

Thanks for all the wonderful emails! 

My wife's trying to talk me out of selling her too. heh

No, the decision has been made. I still feel the same way after
sleeping on it. I have 3 cars I can jump into and go without worrying.
They don't take the time this bus does. Maybe if I had one that was
perfect to start with it wouldn't be so bad, but this bus has me
feeling like I'm chasing shadows.

I don't want to leave this community forever! Just until I can fit
another high-maintenance woman into my life. ;-)
