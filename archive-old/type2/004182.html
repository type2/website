All of the Coleman disposable propane bottle adapters I've seen are for a
Coleman brand gasoline stove being retrofitted to use propane.  And they
place the bottle right next to the stove, on the right hand side.

You might try an outdoor or RV store for a flexible hose, with an adapter
added to allow it to connect to the disposable bottles.  Bear in mind that
this a very expensive way to buy propane.

Your old tank can be pressure-tested and re-certified [if it passes
inspection and pressure test], and repainted.  Don't be deterred by surface
rust and a scuzzy tank appearance.

Replacement bulk propane tanks are available in many sizes, shapes, and
vertical or horizontal orientation.  there ought to be one that would work
for your stove.

For many years we've used a 2-burner Coleman camp stove burning propane from
a small bulk tank [our '70 Campmobile didn't come with a Westy-installed
stove].  Works very well, and it all stores quickly and compactly.

Subject: [T2] Bus Stove Conversion to Coleman Cylinder


A while back I remember somebody saying they converted their stove to run
off those Coleman propane cylinders. My tank so rusted I can't get it filled
anymore. The Coleman cylinders seem like a good idea for the amount I use
the stove.

Problem is I can't find a regulator/adapter for the coleman cylinder. Anyone
know where I can get one? I've tried the local propane supply guys, no luck.
