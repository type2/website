Subject: Re: Fumes exposure 

&gt;&gt;breathing apparatus is the way to go (not one of those .99 dust masks). Why
&gt;&gt;not error on the side of caution, it is your brains, lungs etc??? I can't
&gt;&gt;understand why people would wanna breathe that stuff in?? If anyone wants

&gt;Buy a respirator now or you'll need a more expensive one later, right?  I
&gt;agree with safety first, I think what stops people is the $$ or $$$ for a
&gt;good unit and the intangible rewards for the investment (i.e. longer life,
&gt;less health problems).
Another thing to remember is some of these saftey ratings are for all day
every day exposure for years. Now avoiding any contact is good, but
don't confuse short very infrequent contact with day in day out exposure   

&gt;Here's a hairball idea I've had (I currently don't have a breathing
&gt;apparatus aside from my own lungs, that is):  I was thinking of taking one
&gt;of those army surplus gas masks and fitting it with a long hose that I could
&gt;place outside my workspace near a clean air source.  It seems like an
&gt;affordable way to avoid paint fumes/sawdust--I don't know how large the hose
&gt;would have to be or the limits of its length for safe breathing--I figure
&gt;after passing out a few times for lack of 02, I'll eventually get it right
&gt;;).  I haven't tried making one yet, just thought I'd &quot;throw the idea in the
&gt;air.&quot;
I don't know what your lung capacity is, but I'd guess it is on the order of
2litres? Therefore you only get a maximum of 2 litres worth of pipe, say
10ft of 1&quot;id? Even at that, you aren't getting any new air, althoug a bit of 
difusion might happen.
