I put my 81 in the shop last week to check my brakes and was told on Sat. that
I needed new rotors and best price was $129 ea. Told them to hold on while I
checked Bus Depot's page and found the rotors at $49ea. Got Ron on the phone
at noon Monday and damned if the things weren't delivered the next day!

Ron's a bitch to get on the phone at times but the prices are outstanding and
this is my second experience with excellent hurry up service. Do some business
with him.
