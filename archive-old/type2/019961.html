Subject: help with an 82 camper

I need some information on an 82 westy. I am not sure if this is the
correct list. I am currently looking at an 82 westy. It is a turbo
diesel. It has been sitting for 1 yr. The guys friend drove it over his
house a year ago and left it. Now this guy wants it out of his yard. It
looks fine except for the 4 flat tires. He doesnt have any information
on the bus. I am going to try and get over there and put a battery in it
and try to start it. Is there ANY information that anyone can give me
about turbo diesels? Good bad or ugly? The guy only wants 150 for it. If
it starts I'd be interested but I have no idea what to look for.

Thanks,
Sharon
