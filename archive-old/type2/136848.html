Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

If you are planning on running any type of potentially sensitive 
electronics make sure you buy either a pure or modified sine wave 
inverter, IDEALLY PURE. I've run enough evolutions of my bus'puter over 
the years to have fried power supplies and devices that didn't like 
dirty power. Certainly any inverter will crank out power but your 
devices wont last long if its dirty. Laptops handle that better because 
they have their external, quite robust, power supplies.

The bus makes a great place to work, after many different versions I 
now have a 19&quot; LCD mounted in my Safare top, wireless keyboard and 
mouse  run from a loaded 12&quot; powerbook with 802.11g which is quite 
nice. I built a tray inside  the jump seat that houses the inverter, 
cables and powerbook out of sight. Its great on long trips.

I actually just ordered one of those new Apple Mac Mini's to replace 
the powerbook, SUPER small, its going to be great. Cant wait for it to 
get here.
