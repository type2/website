Subject: Re: [T2] Eurovans?

Hello Guys   Now coming from someone who works on these . They are a PITA to 
work on even worse with the VR6 but they drive wonderful  and the later ones 
have 200hp I dont like all the plastic water fittings but both style of engines 
seem to be holding up well . I have seen some of the VR6 timing chain guides 
break at about 100K  and this requires a tranny drop so if doing a clutch on 
one of these that is the time to do a chain also   Parts are costly   later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
