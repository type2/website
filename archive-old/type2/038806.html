Anti sieze anti sieze anti sieze.  Its grease with graphite powder
suspended in it, when the grease fries off the graphite statys to protect
your threads from rusting.  I think copper based antisieze may be best for
exhaust, but i have a huge tub of the graphite stuff that i use on
everything.

take care,
