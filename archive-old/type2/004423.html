&gt; &gt; I was told that MoFoCo manufactures their own heads (except type 4) and
&gt; &gt; I've heard a lot of negative feedback about them a lot of it from list
&gt; &gt; members but everything they make can't be crap or they wouldn't still be
&gt; &gt; in business.
&gt;
&gt; Then explain why GEX is still in business!  :)
&gt;
&gt; One law of business seems to be that &quot;cheap pushes out good.&quot;  In terms of
&gt; our VWs, this means that there is a proliferation of &quot;10,000 mile
&gt; rebuilds&quot;, ill-fitting rubber and tin, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I try to make it a policy to buy from the suppliers that make a concerted
&gt; effort to stock quality merchandise.  I may pay a bit more, but it is
&gt; ususally repaid in service and advice.
