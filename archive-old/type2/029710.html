&gt; missing something so maybe someone who does speak german could offer a
&gt; translation as i am interested in this.  I am planning on purchasing a
&gt; standard bus sometime in the next few yeas and outfitting it per &quot;journey's
&gt; under difficult conditions&quot;  I think this would make for an interesting bus
&gt; and modified only per vw specs. My westy is already too heavy to be adding
&gt; anything to and i want it stock.

&gt; &gt; He has also installed two extra handbrake leavers in his van to
&gt; &gt; breakdown a whell tha is free spinning when stuck in the mud or sand.
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a very good idea and the setup is great as it does not
&gt; &gt; interfere with normal handbreake function.
&gt; &gt; Has anyone got experience with this? or any thoughts?

this is similar to a &quot;cheapie&quot; turning brake setup on a dune buggy.  The
idea is that if you have a wheel spinning you can use an individual wheel
brake to stop that wheel, allowing the other wheel to get some torque.

the more &quot;elegant&quot; version of this has individual hydraulic master
cylinders for each wheel.  the &quot;regular&quot; master cylinder feeds into this
so that the brakes work normally, but when the turning brake master
cylinder is actuated it only stops one wheel.

this approach takes more plumbing, but compared with the extensive
metalwork involved in the emergency brake  conversion the hydraulic option
actually looks easier to implement!  It also will work better because it
actuates both brake shoes equally, which the e-brake does not do.

This mod might be useful for a real off-road fanatic, but the effort would
be way more than the increased utility for 99% of bus drivers!
