13.8 volts is the normal output of VR.  Your radio has a power supply that 
will include a fuse, a transformer, a DC-DC bridge (in case), and a 
more precise Voltage regulator.

Things besides radios probably do not need really constant voltages, they just
need to be close.  I wonder about analog clocks though.  Your wiper motor
doesn't care whether they get the wrong voltage, but you wouldn't want to give
a 6v fan 13v.  Or a 12v fan 120v, for instance :-)



It IS floored!
