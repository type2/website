&gt; Hello Chris and guys    I had a small heater like that cause a fire under a 
&gt; bus one time in a small garage . The bus unknown to me had a small gas leak 
&gt; behind the engine.It was just like what happened to Terry with the drop lite. 
&gt; Thank goodness I had a large fire bottle sitting right there, didn't hurt the bus 

speaking of fire bottles, does anyone know of a source for inexpensive CO2
fire bottles, the dry chemical ones work fine, but boy are they a mess to
clean up after,  (better than a fire, but)
