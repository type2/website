Subject:      a favor for the Peachstate folks

anybody who was at the Hard Labor Creek campout ...

did anybody get any pictures of the red/maroon vanagon camper?? the owner,
John Villines, took it down to a fixit-shop, and some loonie let their car
go out of control and smashed into John's camper (as it was being moved
by the shop people)!!!! :(  anyway, he's fearful of the shop's insurance
company trying to screw him around about the condition of the bus PRIOR
to the accident, and would appreciate any pictures that might have been
taken of his bus ... especially any digital pictures (we can't recall
who had the little digital camera) that could be sent directly to him.

here's john's email address:
      &quot;John C. Villines&quot; &lt;jcvinc_at_mail.atl.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

thanks.
joel
