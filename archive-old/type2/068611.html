Subject: Fire/Snark trap - the sequel

  This is a bit crude but if I had an open fire it would work.

 You see the sprinklers where you work are held closed with a piece 
of low temp. melting lead.

 So I still want manual control, if you don't just turn off the water 
main at work and unscrew the one over your desk.

 Make it the bosses desk.

 Here's the redneck version: take a mouse trap and wire it open with
a piece of solder wire, low temp. The kind you can melt with a match.

 Run a couple of leads up and rig so when the solder melts the wires
make contact and set off the Snark Alarm.

 I would really prefer some magic box tho. It's gonna get a lot of 
laughs my way.
