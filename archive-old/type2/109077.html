A while back, maybe 2 years ago, I got into watching Scooby on the Cartoon
Network. During one episode, they were driving along in the Mystery Machine
when it broke down. Freddie went to check the engine and lo and behold, it
was in the rear! Mind you, the MM looked more like a Dodge (to me anyway)
and NOT a VW. I don't know if that has anything to do with people calling
your bus a ScoobyMobile or not, just a bit of trivia.
I am new to the list, mainly lurking, except for a comment about pissing on
the door in an ice storm. ;^) I plan to post an intro soon. This is a kewl
list, BTW!
