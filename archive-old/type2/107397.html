Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve

&gt;&gt;&gt;What do you mean? Block heater of some kind?
	Yup block heater. Both my beetle and van have he same style
block heater. At nights it is still getting down to the 50's (0 degrees
Celsius)


&gt;&gt;- key on, deflect flap in the AFM for 20 seconds to prime the fuel
rail.
&gt;&gt;- spray some starter fluid in there

Flap in the AFM? Is that the accelerator? Sorry for my ignorance. Spray
the starter fluid in where?


&gt;&gt;The only relay you want to use is on terminal 50 to isolate the
ignition
&gt;&gt;switch current from current required to energize terminal 50, the so
&gt;&gt;called
&gt;&gt;hot-start relay.

The hot start relay is exactly what I tried but the relay chatters. All
automotive ones I could find did. By chatter I mean that it turns on and
off really quickly. The relay itself was rated at 40A
