Subject: Carb Question ( '73 Dual )

I'm having some trouble with the carbs on my 1973, dual carb, 1700cc engine,
and I have very little experience with them. As in I know their function,
and how to make idle and synch adjustments but beyond that and I just
haven't been there yet. I noticed recently that I have very little power
anywhere. I have recently re-enabled my automatic chokes for the winter
weather and I thought that perhaps they were set a little to tight. So first
I thought I would adjust the synchronization, so I took the air cleaner
(full stock system) off and noticed that the choke plate (correct term?) on
the passenger side had some carbon deposited on it, ignoring this for the
time being, I put my Uni-Syn on top of the left bank carb. It pushed
(sucked, whatever) the little red thing all the way to the top (looked like
it would have liked to have gone higher but couldn't), so I pulled it off
and put it on the other one (passenger side), it barely cleared the lowest
line. So I thought, therein lies the rub, my carbs are way out of synch...
However, the trouble is that I noticed that when I have the engine running,
and I rev it up, it tends to cut out a little and then directly afterwards
(as the engine is returning to life) spray gas and/or a small flame out of
the left bank carb... Why? Do I have a poorly adjusted valve or is it
something worse? Should I rebuild my carbs? (They haven't ever been rebuilt
in the 10 years I've known this bus, but I do run carb cleaner through the
gas every three tanks or so) I'm pretty confused at this point, I did a full
tune up about a week ago (points, plugs, condenser, valve adjust, timing
adjust, new brakes, new shocks, oil/filter change). Any suggestions are
appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Kevin V.
