&gt; &gt; Also I am replacing my Engine and have decided on a VEGE unit.  I was
&gt; &gt; intending on replacing it with the original 1600 AD engine but I am
&gt; &gt; considering going for the 2L instead could anyone advise on what else I may
&gt; &gt; need to do to upgrade i.e new carbs etc. and any alternatives to VEGE?
&gt; 
&gt; Vege (Dutch) have a good reputation.  If you are going for an off the shelf
&gt; rebuilt they would be a good choice.
&gt; Changing to 2L - this depends a lot on geography.  Where are you?  I know
&gt; that outside North America these engines are quite scarce, so you might have
&gt; trouble finding a complete set of tinware, flaps, fan housing etc.  These
&gt; are no longer available new.  You might need to buy a complete used engine
&gt; just for the bits.  There are aftermarket carbs and linkages available so
&gt; this might not be such a problem.  The other thing is the transmission - I'm
&gt; not sure but you&gt;

&gt; 
 I am considering replacing the engine in my 74 westy. I was going to go
ahead an purchase another 2liter. What would the price and reliablility
difference be betweent going with another 2liter or going with a 1600cc
thanks,
