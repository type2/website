The original post mentioned that there was no oil pressure at idle.  My
question is what was your rpms at idle?

		I am running my idle as high as 1200 rpms to avoid a zero
reading, which sometimes works. I would like to be around 950.



If your idle checks out okay, then does this problem occur only when your
engine is warm? 
	
	Yes pressure when cold is 20 psi or better

What type of engine oil are you using, and what is your
engine temp when this problem occurs. 

	Castrol 20w50 and 210 degrees.

 It could be that your engine is running
hot causing your oil to thin and the pressure to drop.  You should check out
your fuel delivery system and ignition, and check for vacuum leaks which is
a
common cause for hot engines and low rpms.

	Been down this road a lot. Mixture is correct and the engine runs
great.

Just a thought.
	Keep them coming
