&gt; &gt; CV joints are cheap replacing em is a PITA, I always work under &quot;if in
&gt; &gt; doubt throw it out&quot; when it comes to CV joints
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I agree with replacing CV's if they're sus (and I'd do them all
&gt; together), but when I wanted to get my newly restored bus on the road
&gt; recently and I was still waiting for my 4 new CV's to arrive I decided
&gt; to put the old ones back on until the new ones arrived. They were (all
&gt; 4) BADLY pitted on both the inner and outer races (one direction only)
&gt; but the balls weren't pitted. When assembled (cleaned with new lithium
&gt; grease) they were all still 'tight' to assemble. I installed them so
&gt; they would drive on the non pitted side. That was about 10k km ago (~6k
&gt; mi) and they still drive smoothly with no noise!!! I plan to leave them
&gt; in until they become noisy and keep the new ones as spares.

You may have a long wait!

&gt; Here's a question though, with the new CV's (Lobro) how tight should
&gt; they be? Of the 4, two are that tight I cannot move the inner race
&gt; relative to the outer race at all by hand. The other two move quite
&gt; easily, but without any 'play'. Is that normal?

Mine were all very stiff, probably due to the dry moly coating.
