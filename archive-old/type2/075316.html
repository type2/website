Subject: Re: Bus Utility

Well, I don't know how utilitarian this was, but when I was a student 
teacher in Georgia, I loaded 27 kids in my '74 Westy and drove a 
couple turns around the parking lot. They were EVERYWHERE. It took a 
few tries to get them all in, but they loved it and talked about for 
weeks. The point of it all was to get their creative juices flowing 
for a writing assignment about traveling.
They were 9th graders and I figure they weighed about 120 lbs on 
average. That would be about 3200 lbs in my van. The van didn't 
suffer any (as far as I could tell).
