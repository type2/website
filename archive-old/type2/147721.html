Subject: Re: [T2] ign switch part question

&lt;Because if someone takes the replacement switch and with a screwdriver sets in the in the far left position,
the switch won't go into the housing!  I take the replacement switch,
turn it all the way over the left (1st) position, then click it to the
right one position.  From Left to Right (clockwise) Position 1 on the
new switch is &quot;accessory&quot;, position 2 is OFF, Position 3 is ON and
Position 4 is START.  Be sure your Ignition Lock Cylinder/Steering
Lock/Housing is in the normal OFF position, then set your switch in
the 2nd position and it SHOULD slide right in.  Try it and see what
happens.&gt;

Does this apply to a '78? From what I see there is only one position for my switch to mate with the ignition lock. 

Having trouble getting my igniton lock to rotate far enough to fire the starter. 

Whew. Am tired of this project! &lt;griN!&gt; 

Chris
