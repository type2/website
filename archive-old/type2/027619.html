Hey team,
  So I've got a couple of questions I was hoping ya'll could help me with.  
First, I've just pulled up in Nashville (4,000 mile trip, loaded down, not a 
single problem!!!), and I was wondering who could recomend a good mechanic 
and a parts supplier around here (I'm actually south of town in Franklin).  
Any good junkyards within a few hours would be cool, too (Chattanooga, 
Knoxville, or Mongomery area).
  Also, tell me if this makes sense.  I was trying to give my bus her post 
trip tune up when I realized there isn't a single mark on my pulley to set 
the timing.  If it is an after market pulley (which I'm pretty sure it is), 
should I take it to a mechanic to have them time it once and mark it for me? 
  There is a very faint scratch at what could be 5 degrees BTDC, but it 
doesn't seem to be running to smooth when I'm statically timing it to this 
mark.
  ...And, I just replaced my oil cooler yesterday, but I'm not too sure I 
got the fan lined up just right in the housing when I put it all back 
together (I'm hearing kind of a clanging noise coming from it).  Is there a 
trick to centering everything just right other than giving it the hairy 
eyeball?
  Any list wisdom would be much appreciated by me and especially by the bus. 
  This is my first air cooled VW, and I've only had her for a couple months 
so go ahead and be specific if you'd like.  I'm not incompetent, just 
ignorant.
Muchisimas Gracias,
ryan
