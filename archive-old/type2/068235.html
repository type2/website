Subject: Re: Plugs &amp; Compression testing

&gt; The important thing is probably to do the same for all four cylinders and
&gt; look for the same results.

The important thing is to try to get the automobile industry to use the proper
test for leaks -- a leakdown test, and put the compression test into the
deservedly obscure place it belongs.  This is not hard.  The tester is only
slightly more expensive than a good compression tester.  The downside is
that you need an air compressor.  But with a VW, the typical home needs one
anyway (^;

Compression tests, on a sealing engine will tell you how much crud has 
accumulated in the head.  It normally won't reveal those ever-present cracks
between the valve seats, for example, will fail to show minor coolant leaks
(for us waterboxer types).  A leakdown test does all of this well.  Maybe
Bob will do a semon on building the tester and using it.

Bob?
