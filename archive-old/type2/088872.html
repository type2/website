It is still fuel injected, correct?
Check the large hoses going to the big S hose. Especially the one going to the
breather box. If any of them have slipped off, this will cause your problem.
As the engine moves under torque, the gap gets wider. At idle, the engine does
not move.

Hey all..
I just got my 1978 Bus up and running. It had been sitting for over 3
years...I bought it about a week (or so) ago and the place I bought it is a VW
garage...They know the air-cool...anyway, the engine had been rebuilt, and new
alternator is in place...new oil...new sparks...the whole nine yards...About
the only problem it was showing was an odd oil leak around the left hand side
valve cover...After taking it off, cleaning it, new gasket, then running the
bus around a bit, adjusting the cover some more, the oil leak seems to be
gone.
So I drove it here and there, the speed an average of about 40 MPH...Then
tonight I took it out to Miramar (about 20 miles from where I live in Miami)
and cruised along at about 70...Seemed to be fine. Stopped and let my brother
off at work. Engine purring. Turned the corner--Stall. Got about 40 feet. Let
it sit for a few minutes (thought it might be hot)...Turned over, and it would
start, but then stall. Figured maybe the gas gauge is inaccurate, so pushed it
to the Chevron right around the corner. 3.180 gallons later, it was full. So I
knew it was not out of gas. Jumped in and started, drove home about 3 miles,
when it started to stall again. Long story short, I got home in third gear,
limping...It would go up to 40, then sputter down to 30, then up to 40...and
so on. Barely made it home. When I did stop at lights, and sit, the engine
would be fine. Then I would put it into first, and it would almost
stall...thus why if I left it in third, I got home. Weird. I have had 11 VWs
in all (4 Type 1, a Type 3, two Type 2, A Ghia, and three Rabbits) and never
had I run into this before...Any ideas? I am tired, it's late; maybe I'm
missing the obvious...
