Subject: Bike, ski racks

Hello out there:

I have been seeking ways to install a bike/ski rack on my '72 Westy. These
are the roof-top Yakima, Thule types ... the current manuals for these
products call for drilling holes in the pop type and mounting the brackets
there. I'm not hot on the idea of drilling into my poptop, especially since
it seems like sooner or later the whole thing will start tearing from the
pressure. 

Anyway, I have seen a few other buses passing by with extended mounts that
hold the racks over the pop tops. 

Anybody had any experience with this? Where can I get these mounts, etc.?
Anybody have a set for sale? 

Thanks!
