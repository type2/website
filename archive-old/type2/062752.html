Subject: Re: Hurrican Fran vs. Rumba the VW Bus 

    i'm writing this as Hurricane Fran bears down on the NC coast. i've
    obviously cancelled a day trip to Wilmington i had been wanting to take.
    seeing as they have evacuated wilmington. the storm should hit the coast in
    about 3 hours or so...then towards raleigh around midnight. last forcast i
    heard was gusts of up to 50mph + 10-12 inches of rain expected. tornado
    warnings all over the place. i get off of work about 12am-1am.
    
    i can't imagine a class III huricane packing 115mph is gonna be all that
    weak when it heads 2 hours inland. hmm, question is, will Rumba the 74
    Retrowestie get me home without being blown off the road. anyone driven
    a van in a hurricane before and are still around to talk about it? :-)
    maybe they will let us go home early? i don't think a van is what you
    want to drive if you have to drive in a storm like this.....

don't do it.  i've found 40 mph to be a bitch.

when we last had 80 mph here, i parked by trusty '78
dead center on the second floor of the biggest parking  
garage in town and left it for the duration.
