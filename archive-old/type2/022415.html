Peach State Transporters, the Georgia chapter of NEATO, along with the
South Eastern VW Club is hosting their 8th annual Vintage VW Show
tomorrow, Saturday the 19th at Southern Polytechnic in Marietta, GA.

All air-cooled VWs are invited to attend.  &quot;If you can drive it, we want to
see it!&quot;  If you drive an air-cooled VW to the show, you are part of the
event.  No going out to the parking lot to see all the cool VWs that are
driven to the show but not entered.  VW Trends will be providing
magazine coverage of the event.

You VW not running?  Come anyway and enjoy the show and swap
meet.

A few of us will be camping in the parking lot tonight (Friday) and
several of us will be camping at Lake Alatoona about 20 minutes north
Saturday night.  If you want to camp with us Saturday night get in touch
with me at the show Saturday morning so we can go get a campsite for
you.

Hope to see you and your VW there!
