Subject: RE: [T2] Rear/side window installation

&gt; When we did get the top in,
&gt; the bottom would slip out. There are brackets along the bottom
&gt; sill for the track cover which did not permit us to put the top
&gt; in first. What's the secret? Should I soak these gaskets or
&gt; something? This is incredibly frustrating.

Same thing happened to me when replacing the rear side window recently. We
were also using the string method, lubricated with dishwashing soap.
It basically took a LOT of brute force to get it in place. Two people on the
outside pushing, one inside pulling the string. It was quite a PITA, but it
worked out in the end.
