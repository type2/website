Subject: Re: [T2] pulling crank gear

I think that vwalley_dot_com sells a gear puller (much cheaper than the others I have seen, around $25) for the type IV engine. If not he is always willing to create a new product. Contact him and ask. I got a nice cylinder head hold down kit from him for the type IV engine. Not in his catalog yet.

I just had my gear pressed off at a local shop. Only cost $5.00. The brass gear was on there tight.

&gt; I've been slowly disassembling a 2 liter engine in my spare time, My question is this ---  since I don't really want to take it to a shop to have it hydraulically pressed off, what are my options as far as gear pullers go?

&gt; And secondly,  should the brass distributor gear pull off so easily?  Bentley says it's an .004 interference fit.
