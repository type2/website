&gt; &gt;I expected the bumpers to be L90 D but it turns out
&gt; &gt; these are cloud white also (as I found out when touching up some spots).
&gt;
&gt; I think you find that Silver White is the color you are after. I believe the
&gt; code is L87.

No, Jan Willem is actually right! I just remembered Ron van Ness once
sent me copies of his microfiche collection. He also sent me copies of
colorlists. Only the most common colors are on it. The colors of certain
specific body parts are mentioned as well. For the 1970 model it says:

	&quot;Wheel disc, rim: L581 cloud white
	Hub cap: L70 x grey silver; model 241, 244 L41 black&quot;

and

	&quot;Bumpers: L581 cloud white, model 271, 271: L567 Ivory

The bumpers and wheels were cloud white. Just noticed another weird
thing: deluxe microbuses (model 241 and 244) had black (L41)
hubcaps?!?!? Never seen those, thought they were always chrome.


The 1971 model was the first one to have &quot;Pastell white&quot; bumpers.
Perhaps I should add this info to the site as well. May be in the
future...
