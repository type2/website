Hey all,
Looking through Parade magazine (comes with many Sunday papers throughout
the country) I saw an article on young inventors, and the lead group had
taken an '82 Vanagon camper and put a VW Quantum turbo diesel engine in
which runs on cooking grease.  Since of course cooking grease is pretty much
solid at room temperature they had to devised a fuel heating system to allow
the fuel to flow freely.  They are now on a road trip around the country
fueling up with cooking grease donated by various eateries in the towns they
visit.
