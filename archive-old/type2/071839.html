Hi, I have a question on behalf of a friend who drives a '65 beetle. Over the 
weekend, he brought his beetle all the way from indiana to canada. anyway, on 
his way back, he started having trouble driving fast on the interstate. as he 
went on, his maximum speed kept dropping till he was cruising at 40mph (no 
longer on the interstate by then). he did change is fuel filter and checked 
his fuel pump (which seems okay). what he did notice is some rust in the old 
fuel filter which could be from the fuel tank. does anybody have any idea 
where the problem could be and a way to tap the problem? all advice are 
welcome! thanks
