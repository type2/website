&gt;I'm wondering about what damage graphite can do to a lock.  I've always

I've not found it as effective and cleaning out the lock. Graphite just seems to gum it up.

FYI. After the lock is super clean and you put in a new key you'll also find that the edges on the key are so sharp it won't go in easily unless you lubricate the lock with triflow.
