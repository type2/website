Hi all,

I has been brought to my attention that there are still some folks who don't
know that the 'official' caravan to Jerome Jamboree is now scheduled to
leave
Phoenix on Friday morning at 9:00 AM.  It will still meet and leave from the
Home Depot parking lot on Thunderbird Road, just east of I-17.  There is,
however, a small glitch in this.  The &quot;OFF-Ramps&quot; from I-17 to Thunderbird
Road are
CLOSED.  You will need to exit I-17 one exit early and make you way to the
Home Depot on the surface streets.  The &quot;ON-Ramp&quot; from T-bird onto I-17 is
open,
so the caravan's departure should not be affected.

There will be another 'un-official' caravan leaving Phoenix on Saturday from
the same Home Depot parking lot.  This is basically being put together by a
group of folks who can't make it up Friday.  No problem!  It's always better
to
caravan in a group than to travel by yourself.  We knew this would happen
when
we made the change to Friday, and it's good to see some folks taking the
initiative to do this.

In addition, there has been a small change is the vending policy at Jerome
Jamboree.  Swapping of old VW parts is encouraged, as it always has been, at
your campsite.  This has not cahanged.  The change is for &quot;NEW ITEM&quot; vendors
only
(anyone selling new parts, clothing, whatever).  You need to be
Pre-registered by sending in your fee of $25 (for one vehicle for the
weekend) and we will
send you your 'vendor's certificate'.  You must have this prior to the
event,
as you will be required to show it at the gate in order to get in.  (Yeah,
yeah, it's a bit of a pain, but it is what it is).  In additon, &quot;NEW ITEM&quot;
vendors will be required to set up on &quot;Vendor Row&quot; only.  On our website
(www.arizonabusclub_dot_com) there is a small form to print, fill out and mail
in with your
fee.

You can email me or call me at (623)877-8662 if you have any further
questions.  Thanks for your time and understanding in these changes.

Jon Stanton, Pres.
Arizona Bus Club
