[...]

&gt; How do you folks determine how much torque you have on the castellated
nuts
&gt; on the rear axles?  I believe that 295 ft/lbs is what's recommended,

No, it is 253 for bays.
If you go 250, more than likely the cotter pin won't just line up and you
will need to go a smidge more.

&gt; but the
&gt; torque wrenches I've seen only go to 250 and are the adjustable clicker
&gt; kind, which were not recommended by the list a few weeks ago.


&gt; BTW, what does YMMV stand for?

Like the gas mileage figures put out by the EPA :

Your Mileage May Vary
