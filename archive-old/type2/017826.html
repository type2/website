I'm not sure how many of you live in the DC area.  However, I was
hopping that was a small crowd.  I have been contemplating going to the
bugout and selling my assortment of parts.  Or I was hopping someone
else might already be doing this and I could help defray the cost and go
in with them.

Is there anyone interested in doing this.   Or has any one else done
this in the past and have any advice?

Thanks
Brent
