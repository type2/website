Subject: RE: [T2] Plaid Interior

&gt; As of 1pm on Sunday the 28th, there was a beautiful green plaid
&gt; interior in a 77 Westy, in the pullapart yard in south Atlanta, just off
Moreland
&gt; Avenue. &gt; A tad bit of wear on the side of the driver's seat, but
excellent
&gt; fabric


For anyone interested in brand new Plaid fabric for reupholstering, we do
have a small quanitity of the green/yellow plaid from the '76-77 yellow
Westies, available brand new off the roll. This plaid has the same colors as
the plaid used in the green '76-79 Westies, but has a more yellow in the
pattern and less green.

This plaid fabric is brand new NOS Westfalia stock, cut right off of the
roll. $99 buys you enough to reupholster both front seats (excluding vinyl
section of course) or one rear sofabed (excluding mattress over engine bay).
Not on the website or in the catalog, due to very limited availability. Best
is to email me directly if you want some.

Of course, there is also the cheapskate option, which is to cut the plaid
off of the bottom of your upper bunk mattress (the part that is hidden from
view), and use it to reupholster your front seat bottoms.
