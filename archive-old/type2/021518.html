I was just gonna say, check for leaks.. but looks like you got it..

I think what happens is that it sucks in oxygen and the unburnt exhaust
is able to combust again, in the hot muffler...

That could be wrong reaction that's taking place, but yes, holes do
cause backfires..

&gt; I own a 75 FI bus that has 28K miles on a rebuilt engine. She backfires on
&gt; deceleration, specifically when I let up on the gas while the vehicle still
&gt; has enough momentum to cause the engine to rev above idle. The backfiring is
&gt; worse in warmer weather. I know that the exhaust system has leaks. My
&gt; question is: Is a leaky exhaust system the most likley cause of backfiring
&gt; and what damage does excessive backfiring do to an engine? Thanks, Darin
