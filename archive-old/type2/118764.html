Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix installation help

Jason,

This is a common problem according to the tech guy at Pertronix. As I recall
I just trimmed/enlarged the hole with an Exacto knife and file until it
slipped down and allowed the rotor to be installed. Pertronix has a web site
with a tech phone number. Also found out that gap size is not critical -
mine was much larger than suggested by the directions and it works great up
to 7600 rpm in my old race car.

&gt; The issue is basically: the sleeve does not seem to go far enough down
&gt; the shaft to allow the rotor to fit.  In fact, it does not go down far
&gt; enough to even line up with the sensor.  The kit includes a spacer
&gt; plate which can be used to increase the height of the sensor, and
&gt; installing it makes it line up with the sleeve.  But that still leaves
&gt; me with a rotor problem.
