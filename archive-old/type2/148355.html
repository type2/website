Subject: Re: [T2] The mystery Single Cab

It is a mystery. I was thinking about misidentified, or hacked VIN,
but after writing you I thought better of it because of the presence
of the brake booster. But it does baffle me because if VW made a drum
brake option, I'm sure they wouldn't waste their money putting in a
brake booster.

 What is weird is that it is a numbers matching 71. It even has the brake
 booster plate on the front beam but it has never been used.
