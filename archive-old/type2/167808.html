Subject: Re: [T2] REPOST: leaky propane tank safety valve/guage

Mike Soultanian wrote of his propane tank regulator:

&gt;  my safety valve has started leaking around the place where it 
&gt;slides in and out whenever I press it down.  I can jostle it around 
&gt;and eventually it stops leaking, but I figure it's probably best to 
&gt;replace it.

	You figure oh, so correctly.
	Propane vapour is a much better explosive than, say, TNT or 
C4.  It's easier to detonate in confinement, but Unconfined Vapour 
Cloud Explosions are also known (e.g  fuel-air explosives), so people 
&amp;/or structures could be shattered far beyond your side-tent.
	I was for a period a leading analyst of LPG vapour explosions 
&amp; fireballs.  I was even taken in past the armed guards at Sandia 
(N.M) and shown a few slow-motion movies of fuel-air explosives. 
Please take it from me, LPG leaks are a top priority.  It's not just 
you that's at risk.

&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know where I can get a new one?

	No I don't; but I do urge you in the strongest possible way 
to get one.  LPG leaks are anti-social, as well as a severe hazard to 
you &amp; fambly.
