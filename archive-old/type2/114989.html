&gt; I was wondering if it had something to do with emissions. The carbon

&gt; air cleaner that the vac advance line connects.

Fumes that collect in the charcoal canister and &quot;burned&quot; through the intake
system via the EEC valve in the air cleaner. When the engine is idling, the
valve is closed and no fumes are burned. It also seals the system when the
engine is off.
