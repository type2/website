Subject: interior panels

Hi

Well this weeks question is as follows - I have all of my original
interior panels for my bus - i have been considering replacing them
becuase they are very old are very, very dirty - is it possible to
recondition them - ive read the recent post about rubber and im
wondering if there is a similar product for interior vinyl - my interior
panels are also warped etc.. but they dont have any serious holes in the
vinyl - ive tried one automotive cleaner - not armourall - and it didnt
seem to work out that great - but is there something better?????


thanks in advance
