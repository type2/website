Subject: Re: [T2] Pop-top refinishing

  The low VOC has been a pain to the pro painters. however in this case 
the replacement is actually a higher grade product with higher solids.  
from the spec sheet it reads better.  I have a feeling it has a 
corresponding higher price tag as well.  I noted that when i was doing a 
paint job on the house that higher solids meant 15 to  20 percent higher 
price.

&gt; Thanks Jim,
&gt; Any way to discover whether the low-VOC replacement will have the same
&gt; properties for this job?

&gt; Called my local SW rep after digging around on the web sites.  The B54
&gt; line is still made but the W line is discontinued and phased out in any
&gt; area with VOC rules.  B54 Z 101 is what is listed in their listings now
&gt; as a low VOC HS replacement.  Here in denver the old style is still
&gt; available at a couple of stores.
