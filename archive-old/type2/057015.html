Subject: VDO &amp; more?

I just waved bravely as my SO took off in our 1977 Riviera camper (mentally
wishing she would watch the low hanging trees instead of yelling bye) to an
artists work group of women an easy 60 miles away, Terry's a wonderful
women(been married 20 some years) but this is only her second solo with
this bus and her track record isn't good (she's flipped three VWs over the
years) she's an artist not good with anything mechanical, hopefully friend
Jody will do the driving as I've really grown attached to both the bus and
the women?

I've been reading the on going thread on VDO gauges I put both oil gauges
below radio (drilled holes with metal hole saw) and was able to fit the
spin-on mounting thing-a-ma-gig, the ring that spins on can go two
different ways and only fits one way, it's tight and you have to have the
gauge just through the hole as you start the thread but then it tightens up
nice and snug and looks great (didn't use a face plate looks better without
imo.) It also worked out that both gauges read just what I wanted them to,
oil pressure around 40 most of the time, oil temp around 210, YEA!
