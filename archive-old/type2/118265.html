Subject: Re: [VB] ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!

Hey Jim,

I have a culture question for you!  Hey it's Friday.  You said you hope
to she the Smithy in DC.  Which one.  If the aeronautical Smithy, you
have no culture!  If its the Smithy Museum of American Culture, you have
plenty.

Those who've seen them both no of which I am talking.
