I believe the illustrious Mr. Dolan is correct in his assessment.

I also believe this explains why new engines often seem to have excess
internal pressure.  Until the rings, especially, break/seat in the new
engine has a &quot;blowby&quot; problem that aggravates any potential crankcase leaks.
I believe this also explains why some new engines push their dipsticks up in
the tube thus providing false oil level readings.

This is distressing when one has just installed a new powerplant at
considerable expense, but usually resolves itself as break-in progresses.

&gt;&gt; My theory is that as VW engines age, the valve guides are among the first
casualties of age, with rings not far behind.  Once the valve guides and
rings have crossed a certain point, blowby and case pressure build to
stunning levels, far more than the various seals are designed to accomodate.
The engine becomes a leaker at that point and there is very little that you
can do.  The cure is new valve guides and P&amp;C's, but at that point a rebuild
hardly seems justified because compression will still be good, and even a
leakdown test won't show much wrong (if it is only the valve guides) but the
leaks will continue, and new seals won't help. &lt;&lt;
