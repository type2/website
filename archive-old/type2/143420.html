Subject: Re: [T2] What's different baout a 1980 air cooled from a 76?

Hi Chris,

The 1980 bus is a Vanagon. They are a different beast from a  
baywindow, but they are both aircooled and the engine will bolt up.  
Which it would have to do, since the transmissions are not  
interchangeable. The engine tin, the exhaust and airbox would need to  
be swapped from the vanagon engine onto yours.

Except that his exhaust is for square port heads, and your heads have  
oval ports.  You'd need a set of 72-74 heater boxes to solve that.

Short story: It could be done, but it's a LOT of work.


Happy trails,

&gt; Someone off a different list (local camping group) has offered me a

&gt; body when he heard what terrible shape my bus is in (mine is rusted  
&gt; through
&gt; on just about every panel). Now I'm wondering if my engine/tranny is
&gt; swappable into a 1980. Mines a 76 2.0L FI. His is a 1980 aircooled  
&gt; (that's
&gt; all I know of it) that he was going to part out. I found a couple pics
&gt; online, and they LOOK alike.
