Subject: [T2] Busses by the Sea Pics

Hi Volks,
Just wanted to post a link to my site where I have some pics from Busses
by the Sea.  http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/justcampin.htm
All pictures were graciously sent to me from some of the great volks
that Emma (6 months old) and I spent a wonderful weekend with.  Thanks
for the great time.  We look forward to Busses by the Trail.
