Mechanical dwell can decrease as the rpm increases due to point float or
bounce.  In a four lobe distributor it should be less an issue than a six or
eight if the distributor cam lobes are well designed.  If you use a cheap
set of points the spring tension may be weak and/or the pivot may be less
stable than a &quot;quality&quot; part.  The weak spring tension can allow the points
to &quot;float&quot; over the trailing face of the cam lobe.  This &quot;airborne&quot; portion
of it's travel means that the point is in physical contact with it's mate
for less time than at a lower rpm when it stays on the cam for the whole
trip.

If the base is poorly made and the spring is weak and the pivot is sloppy
you can have points that bounce rather than track the cam profile.  This
also results in a decrease in the measured dwell at rpm.

In the case of OEM or better parts, there is often a decrease in dwell at
rpm, but not to the extent that it negatively impacts performance beyond
engineering intent.

For example in my 1968 396 Camaro (solid lifter, 4 bolt mains) the stock
distributor was a single point Delco unit.   With the stock points and no
mods the engine would crank to about 6000 rpm.  By using a vented point and
double - springing it, the engine made power to 7000 rpm.  I would remove
the spring from the old set and slip it behind the spring on the new set.  I
never used them for more than a week.  The car was faster that way.  The
added spring pressure allowed the dwell to remain effective to a higher rpm.


&gt;I thought dwell was supposed to remain constant
&gt;throughout the rpm range of a given engine, but this time the dwell went up
&gt;and down with engine speed. I asked a VW parts guy about it, but he said
&gt;&quot;heck, don't mean nuthin. It's just advancing.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Which makes no sense. If the dwell angle is the measure of how far and for
&gt;how long the points remain open, shouldn't it remain constant? If so, why
is
&gt;my dwell angle going all over the place?
