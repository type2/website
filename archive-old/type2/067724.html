Subject: Beetle Model Numbers

I have had great success selling my VW parts microfiche (thanks all), but 
I am suprised that the air-cooled Beetle fiche haven't moved.  I'm 
wondering if the model listing is confusing.

They are listed as VW 1200/1300 and VW 1302/1303.  What models/years 
might this cover?  Is this VW-speak for all Standards/Supers or is this 
really just for the '61-'66 models and the Super Beetles?  Guess I need 
to break out the magnifying glass and see if I can spot any identifying 
pictures/parts.

Any help would be *greatly* appreciated.  TIA.  :-)
