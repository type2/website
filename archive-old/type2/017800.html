Someone had posted memorizing the weird angle the wrench is at while
removing plugs in a Type IV engine, which I thought was off the wall
until I was parked on my ass changing plugs weekend before last. Sure
enough, a close look at the angle of the wrench makes installing the
plugs a breeze. Just have the new plug gapped and ready to go so the
image and angle are fresh in your mind.
