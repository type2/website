Subject: Re: rear coupler screw

&gt;I am in a quandry about what to do about my stuck rear coupler
&gt;screw. Is the metal of the input shaft softer than that
&gt;of the screw of vise-versa? I really dont know how to
&gt;get it out. I dont think I can use an easy out cause
&gt;it relies on there being threads to come out on. I can turn the
&gt;bolt, (it is the sqaure headed bolt that holds the rear 
&gt;coupler on the tranny input shaft) just fine, it just won't
&gt;go anywhere. Please help......

Randolph,
 
If the screw turns but neither advances nor tightens then the threads are
stripped.   You'll have to drill it out.  But you won't be able to do much
drilling if the thing keeps turning.  

The options here aren't very handy.  I would probably weld the bolt to the
collar, grind it flat, center-punch the bolt, drill it out and re-thread the
hole.  If you don't have welding equipment you might try cleaning the bolt &amp;
collar they building up a fillet of filled epoxy such as JB Weld or similar.
 The object here is to hold the thing in place so you can drill it out.

IF the set-screw is the same as on older buses it is threaded 8x1.25mm, the
same as many other fasteners on your vehicle.  Obtain the necessary tap
before doing any work.To drill out an 8mm bolt you want to start with 3/16&quot;
then open it up to about 13/64 when you have a well-centered hole the length
of the bolt.

Of course, given the location of the thing there's a good chance you won't
have the angle-head drill-motors and such that you'll need to do the work.

That leaves you with the Brute Force Option, something we always have but
don't like to fall back on.

Brute Force means just that.  Grab the bolt with vise-grips.  Pry the
vise-grips away from the fitting while turning it anti-clockwise.  A
set-screw is generally softer than the collar into which it is threaded.  You
should be able to force-feed the thing back through the threads and thus
remove it.

It won't be a happy camper when you get done -- no matter how you get it out
you're going to need a new set-screw and possibly a new coupler, or at least
chase the threads of the coupler.  

If you can't find a 'real'  VW-type shifter-rod set-screw, make one.  You'll
need to grind an accurate cone to the end of whatever bolt you use -- it is
the cone that indexes the shifter-rod to the coupler, insuring proper
alignment.  The cone-shaped end of the set-screw takes more strain than it
should during shifting so try for the nicest possible fit.  With the coupler
out of the way you'll be able to trial-fit the new bolt as you grind the
cone.

Add a nut to the bolt before doing any grinding.  After you get a nice
cone-shape, the nut will chase the threads when you back it off.  But you'll
also want to add a nut to the bolt before installing the coupler.  After the
bolt is torqued down, tighten down the nut, locking the bolt against the
coupler.  A twist of safety wire in the threads of the bolt just above the
nut then securely wrapped around the barrel of the couple would be a smart
thing to do, as would using high-strength loc-tite during installation.  (A
little concentrated heat on the head of the bolt will break the grip of the
loc-tite, should you need to remove it.)
