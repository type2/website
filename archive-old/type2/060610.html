Subject: Re: Should I buy a camper connversion?

Simon,

If you have:

	o  a panel saw
	o  a router
	o  skill at working with plywood
	o  access to baltic birch

I would say, go ahead and do your own conversion on the '78. Get a Reimo 
camper catalog from Steve Lashley (thingguy) -- it's filled with lots of 
pictures of different ways to do a conversion.

My personal opinion is that while the Westfalia kits for the splitties 
and the Vanagons are tops, their baywindow kits leave a lot to be 
desired. So don't desire; put in what you want and need.
