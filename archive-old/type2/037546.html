Subject: 72 rescued...and some questions
Content-Disposition: inline

Finally got the 72 microbus 'the pumpkin' on saturday. I knew if I had the
sincerest pumpkin patch in all of Queens County it would come. The good news is
it rolls- not easily, but what the hey? 10 years in a garage of horrors didn't
kill its spirit. It was in a flood at one point though, and when I drained the
oil I got at least a quart of pure mountain spring water before any oil started
to come out. The motor is frozen needless to say, and must come out.
the inevitable questions:
1. can you get away with using the 1700 carb system on an 1800 block, not
driving to california, just to maybe get through the inspection; or
2. If putting a 74 block&amp;carbs into a 72 bus, do you use the 74 gas cable (which
is 50mm or so longer) or stick with the gas cable for the 72 bus?
3. are there clutch compatability issues between the 1700 and 1800? In other
words, should I stick the 72 clutch on the 74 block when using it in a 72 bus?

many thanks
