Subject: The Dreaded R1 Double Relay Resistor = 2.7 ohms

Hi Chuck,

Good news my friend. The bus is in motion. It was the dreaded crispy fried 
R1 resistor in the double relay. The problem was I couldn't see the resistor 
color code. Anyway I went to the university lab and desoldered the resistor 
to take a look at the back. Not much color there either. I know the first 
band is red (2), the second band is gray or violet (8 or 7), the third I 
beleive is gold or black(x 0.1 or x1), and the fourth is of course the 
tolerance gold. So I think that it was a 2.7 or 27 ohm resistor.

I don't know if you have time to read all this so...

CONCLUSION (in case you are tired)

I ended up installing the 2.7 ohm and it gave me an impedance at pin86b of 
65 ohms.

THINKING OUT LOAD (please correct me if I'm wrong)

I thought 2.7 ohms to be very small so I first tried the 27 ohm. It gave me 
an impedance of 90 ohms at the 86b pin. I remember you saying that you had 
20 ohms on yours. I was surprised that it was that high. Essentially the 
resistor is in parallel with the diode and then they connect in series with 
the coil. A 27 ohm resistor in parallel to a high resistance diode should 
basically give a 27 ohm resistance? But it gave me 90 ohms. So I stuck in 
the 2.7 ohm and I measured the impedance at 86b and found 65 ohms. This is 
as low as I could go so that's what stayed. I tested the relay with a 12 V 
at 86b and it worked. BIG SMILE :). So I put it in the bus and away she 
went. I went for an hour drive and it ran beautifully. Very 
smooooooooooooth.
So problem solved. Oh yeah I could only get a 1/4 W Resistor at school so I 
will have to pick up a 1/2 W and pop it in for safe measures. Hopefully the 
system has been hugely over designed. Haha.

Well if you read this far sorry for keeping you. But I really appreciate 
your help. You were very good guidance. It's hard to diagnos a problem when 
you don't even see it.

So by the way how is your bus running? What year is it? When did you get it? 
Where do you live again? Is it warm there this time of year?

Later,

Matt
