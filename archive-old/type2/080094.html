Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild wont start! any ideas?

well, almost everyone is asking me to double check that the ignition is set up correctly, the timing, and redo the valves... i'm away for the weekend so i'll try those when i get back... one question:

now i'm second guessing myself as to the cylinder locations...

so if i'm standing at the back of the car, looking in to the engine compartment... &quot;back&quot; is close to me (toward the rear of the van) front is furthest from me (toward the front of the van)...that makes number one right side front, number 2 right side rear, number 3 left side front (which is confusing cause i read muir when i first started learning vans and doesn' he harp on number 3 being next to the oil cooler? or is that in bug / uprights?) and number four left side rear...

and then the distributor turns clockwise (looking down on the rotor) and the firing order is 1-4-3-2

oh yeah reminder - 75 1.8L FI solid lifters

right?

bill

&gt; Maybe a dumb question but.....  Are you really really sure you have the timing

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i've been getting great advice on the list as i've rebuilt my 4th van (along
&gt; with many other things here and there through the years)... and now i have
&gt; another question on my latest...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; did a full rebuild on Lucy, my latest 75 1.8 camper, and just finished getting
&gt; everything together this morning... hooked everything up and turned it over and
&gt; she caught for a fraction of a second and died... kept doing this, and on about
&gt; the fourth time there was a puff of fuel-air and a little bit of flame out one
&gt; of the intake hoses (the hoses that seal the connection between the intake air
&gt; distributor and the intake headers - the two deals on either side that the
&gt; injectors are attached to)... anyway, it only happened on the left side...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so i have rebuilt heads from a shop here in seattle (northwest connecting
&gt; rods)... i noticed that they pink their valve seats in, if that makes a
&gt; difference here... the reason i mention valves is because as i've thought this
&gt; problem through this evening on my way up to the san juans in Molly, my backup
&gt; 76 celica that i bought for two hundred bucks when i tore the van engine apart
&gt; and who has run perfectly fine for five months even though she backfires,
&gt; diesels, and can't maintain an idle in the cold (you should see the nightmare
&gt; that the last mechanic to work on her made of the carb linkages and lines - yet
&gt; there's nothing quite like the 20R enging) - i've been thinking that the only
&gt; reason you might get pressure back into the intake headers is if the intake
&gt; valves are not sealing all the way when the piston is on the upswing, so i must
&gt; be getting some blowby into the intake system... but i did set the valves, and
&gt; i'm fairly certain i did it correctly (i say fairly only beca!
&gt; &gt; use i am always second guessing myself)...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; anyway, if anyone might have an idea of what might be wrong (incidentally,
&gt; though i continued trying to start her she didn't flame out the headers again
&gt; but she still pushes fuel air out cause there is a bit of moisture coming out
&gt; those hoses) i'd love to hear some advice... a couple other things that might
&gt; help the diagnosis: i put a clamp on the boot (that's probably a better word to
&gt; use than hose) where it had pushed out before and that stopped it on that side,
&gt; but only that side... i could conceivably clamp all 8 points on those boots
&gt; (leading to both heads that is) but the more i think about it the more i'm
&gt; worried about the fact that pressure is coming up from the heads... one thing to
&gt; note on the side that it is pushing out the two tubes on the header are slightly
&gt; cocked to the ports on the air ditributor so the boots aren't quite straight,
&gt; thus might not make a terrific seal... also, with further attempts at starting
&gt; she would start and run for a half second (but lon!
&gt; &gt; ger than at first) and then cough to a stop... usually it was when she coughed
&gt; to a stop that i'd hear air being forced out of those boots... oh yeah and my
&gt; timing might not be right on (4 atdc that is) as i didn't mark the distributor
&gt; position adequately (though it's a rebuild with a new cam anyway) - but i did
&gt; line it up with the post for plug 1 with the crank at timing... so i can't be
&gt; far off
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so the plan now is to doube check the valves, see about sealing those boots,
&gt; and cross my fingers unless someone has a better idea... and any help would be
&gt; appreciated!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; worry for writing a book here but i have this tendency to write like a talk
&gt; and my third grade teacher always did say i had a problem with talking too much
&gt; :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks!
