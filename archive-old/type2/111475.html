I would think you would be okay if you just taped off the seals really
well and didn't worry about painting under them.  Probably the easiest thing
would be to use wide painter's tape and then use a razor blade to trim off
the tape right at the top of the rubber.  Maybe leave a little lip of tape
that you could then tuck under the rubber with a small screwdriver (or
something else thin and fairly blunt).  Then apply your paint and, once dry,
pull the painter's tape off the rubber... should leave a clean line.

I'm planning on replacing my seals soon, too, and while my top (and
the whole Bus, really) needs a paint job, I'm likely going to put that
off for about 6-8 months ... the seals just need to be done ASAP, since
they're cracked and rotting badly, and probably letting a fair bit of
water in (luckily, it doesn't rain very much here in San Francisco :-)

On that note, can someone tell me what the exact procedure for pulling
the luggage rack is?  Those seals are probably the worst on my Westy,
and I don't see where the screws go through ... do I need to pull the
headliner in the driving compartment?

Also ... my luggage tie-downs are pretty rusty.. they appear to be riveted
on.  Has anyone else removed/replaced the tie-downs, or should I just take
to them with a bottle of Naval Jelly?

Thanks...
