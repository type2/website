&gt; Sorry, but I better add that I am on the digest, so I'd appreciate a carbon 
&gt; copy to my &lt;Doyt_at_buckeye-express_dot_com&gt; address, if you do reply to the list.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.
&gt; OK, I'm having problems with a freshly overhauled 2-liter engine in my 76 
&gt; Westy. Everything is stock.....fuel injected, no carbs.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine starts and idles for about 8 seconds and stalls. Pressing on the 
&gt; accelerator during this 8 seconds kills the engine instantly. I can 
&gt; immediately restart and get another 8 second idle, if I don't touch the 
&gt; accelerator.
&gt; 
&gt; If I repeat the &quot;restart, let idle and eventually stall&quot;  5 or 6 times, the 
&gt; engine becomes warm enough to continue idling on its own.
&gt; 
&gt; After it is idling on its own, I can operate the accelerator and drive the 
&gt; bus around the shop.
&gt; I haven't had it out on the road yet. I want to get this &quot;stalling until 
&gt; warm&quot; condition resolved first. Or at least I want to understand the condition.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked for electrical pulses to the individual injectors during the 8 
&gt; second idle, and the injectors are receiving impulses.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, I would like to have this engine run right away, without the 
&gt; repeated restarts. But maybe this is just a phase I have to live through, 
&gt; until it gets worn in enough to continue running. This is my first 
&gt; overhaul, and I don't know where to go with this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps someone among you can review these behaviors and make some 
&gt; suggestions that will help me get my bus back into service. I'm listening.
