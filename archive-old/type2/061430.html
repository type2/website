      Hey List:
                          I was wondering what the listees out there use for
a bike rack?
I have a 73 Westy with a homemade trailer hitch on the rear bumper.
It is securely welded to the inner bumper mount.(?)
I thought of getting a rack welded out of 11/2&quot; square tubing and bolting or
pinning it to the hitch.
Any suggestions on how to mount the bikes to the rack?
I know there has to be a few mountain bikers out there who can tell me what
racks they find good for a bus? Being able to access the engine compartment
hatch is important in design.

Thanks Phil
