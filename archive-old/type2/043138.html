Subject: Smoke FX?

Hi Volks,

I'm renting out Das Über-Kamper this weekend for a film shoot, and the
director wanted it know if it would be possible to add some oil and get some
smoke from the exhaust for a shot he has in mind.

If I were to add a teaspoon or so of 10W30 to the right carb, it wouldn't do
any permanent damage would it? Except maybe to a few thousand pesky
mosquitoes, that is.

They said it's my call, if we can do it. I'll tell you all about how the
shoot went on Sunday.
