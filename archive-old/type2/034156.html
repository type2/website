Subject: HELP!! Still Topless in CT (and getting desperate)

Help!
   This is my third try at getting the RIGHT sunroof for my '73 Bus.
Does anyone Know which year tops will fit it? I have a contact from this list 
that has a '78 sunroof. However, he does not know if it will fit my DPO 
mobile. He also knows where to get a '71 sunroof.
   I hope that someone can tell me which will fit or I'll have to resort to 
some alternative. Plywood/plexiglass??? I really would like to drive it but 
it's a little cold out with a 41&quot;x 45&quot; hole in the roof.
Thanks
Ed Dvorak
P.S. I promise I'll stop whining when I get the right sunroof on my Bus
