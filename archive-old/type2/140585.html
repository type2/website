Hi again Dave,

    Just for reference, most all &quot;Flaps&quot; have a chemical dye leak checker
for aluminum. Its a two part substance you spray on/around the crack and it
shows up as a line of different color, a little like the way &quot;Magna flux&quot;
shows up on cast iron or steel. Its a little pricy for a one time use
though, $15.00 to $20.00.
    There is also a &quot;Oil leak dye&quot; chemical you put in the oil, and run the
engine, and then shine a infrared light on the suspected area. Any oil that
is leaking will show as purple or orange depending on type of oil your
checking.
    Its like a 60's bar with a black light system, with the Stones and Doors
on the juke box. While you do your best &quot;Shing-a-ling&quot; in your tie dyed
ruffled shirt and white bell bottoms.
Man these flash backs are killing me!!!

&gt; Hi Howard
&gt; Thanks for the crack locater tip - most excellent.  I'll give it a try
&gt; &gt;    Next time try some &quot;Easy Off&quot; oven cleaner. Not quite as risky!
&gt; &gt;    By the way, you can take a propane torch and very lightly heat (
&gt; &gt;&quot;around&quot; not in the crack ) where you suspect a crack. If there is indeed
a
&gt; &gt;crack, oil will bubble and boil up out of the crack.
