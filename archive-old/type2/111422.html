&gt; &gt; anyone know of a place locally where I might be
&gt; able to pick one up?
 
&gt; There's Kohlweiss in Redwood City and Buggy House
&gt; (search on BH Motor Sports) in Hayward. You might
&gt; also search for a rebuilder (alternators, starters,
&gt; etc) because its been my experience that they
&gt; usually have
&gt; them in stock and you can cut out the middle man.

There's also Donsco VW parts in Belmont; they always
have what I'm looking for; it was nice living a mile
down the road from them when my bus needed parts
constantly. http://www.donscofuncar_dot_com/
