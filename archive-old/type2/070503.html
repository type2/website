Subject: Splitty Rescue Organization?

I have two Australia Shepherds.  One of them I got through an organization
called Aussie Rescue.  The people from Aussie Rescue go to dog pounds, etc.
and pull out Aussies and offer them up for adoption to loving homes.

Is there a Splitty Rescue out there serving the same function?  I ask that
question because I have never seen a '67 or earlier in any of the junkyards
around here.  If there is such an organization that's great...but it must
make it difficult to get used parts at bargain basment prices.
