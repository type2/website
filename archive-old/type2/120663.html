Subject: CDI electronic ignition installation

I was checking out the electrinic ignition that came
with my parts horde (and yes everyone your stuff is
ready to go, I just havent had a chance to get to the
UPS store to get shipping info). And the instalation
instructions that I have are only for American cars.
Anyone have any expierence with Tiger CDI and care to
send me a miny procedure?

Thanks 
Duncan
