&gt; If you use ramps make sure they are the Heavy gauge fully welded kind . You
&gt; see ones that are inadequately braced and some times riveted instead of
&gt; welded. A friend of mine had an uncle who was killed when the ramps buckled
&gt; from the weight of the vehicle.

Or use these...

These are the Rhino Ramps. 12,000 lbs GVWR. Made from some space age plastic
that's guaranteed not to rust, corrode, splinter or knock the front spoiler
off your Bus. Get 'em at your local FLAPS.

Disclosure: this guy's a customer of mine, but I don't get paid anything for
plugging his stuff.
