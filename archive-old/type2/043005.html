Subject: colder plugs

i see in Berg's new catalog (recommended), that he says use colder plugs the 
W7AC Bosch for buses as they disapate heat better under heavy loads (like a 
normal bus)...anyone normally run these? how does the operation and 
performance compare to the stock W8 plugs that have always been in my bus?
