Subject: RE: [T2] Overhead unit

I have this in my wife's 79.  The unit is complete minus the compressor, =
PO
swapped engines, never reinstalled it.  One of my wife's long-term goals
is for me to get a new compressor and get the AC working, but for now
there are more pressing matters.

&gt; Does anyone have the A/C unit depicted in this image:
