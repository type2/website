Subject: RE: [T2] Vehicle Registration Number

&gt; I cannot get on the chat page at vanagon_dot_com, it says I need java browser 
&gt; downloaded and nothing happens, my laptop is very old so I don't know if
it 
&gt; has java.  Plus, George, my 1980 vanagon is aircooled not water cooled
and 
&gt; your type2 webpage says this is the page I should write to for help.

Joyce,

Try this:  Get into the front passenger seat and close the door.  Now open
the door and look at the door frame by your right shoulder.  You should see
a paper sticker with a bar code and a number.  I think that this is what
you seek.  On my 1981 Vanagon Camper, the number starts with two digits,
then has two letters and then a group of six numbers.  If you look at your
VIN Code you will see that the last set of letters and the last six digits
are the same as this sticker.  The first two numbers on the sticker confuse
me as they are the second and third digits of the middle group of four
numbers in my VIN number.  Why VW didn't include that fourth digit is
beyond me.

You should also have a sticker on the driver's door frame in the bottom
right hand corner.  On my 1981, built Nov. 1980 to California emission
standards Vanagon Camper, the driver's door sticker also has the Gross
Vehicle Weight and the maximum allowable weights per axle.  In my case the
seat belt buckle has eroded some of the VIN number, but no so much as have
completely erased it, although it does help to have an active imagination
when reading it!

Hope this helps.
