&gt; 
&gt; In a nutshell, my philosophy:
&gt; 1. Never skimp. The cheapskate always pay the most in the long-run. Buy 
&gt; original or better, never &quot;cheaper&quot;.

Good advice, but don't confuse &quot;expensive with &quot;high quality&quot;.  There's a
lot of expensive junk out there.  When in doubt, ask the list!

&gt; 2. Get ahead of the curve. Anticipate failure and prevent it. E.g.: 
&gt; compression low in one cylinder? Pull the motor and solve the problem while 
&gt; it is cheap, and in your driveway, rather than when it is a catastrophe and 
&gt; the closest town is Bent Arrow, SD.

Also good.  It pained me last christmas to drive 800 miles in our b*g
rather than the bus, but the rapidly-closing valve clearance on #3
dictated otherwise.

&gt; 3. Keep it stock, or damned close. While &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; abounds, 
&gt; none of this &quot;wisdom&quot; comes from experienced German-trained engineers, it 
&gt; comes from machinists and mechanics.._dot_caveat emptor.

When you go away from stock, _you_ become the engineer, and engineering is
pretty hard work!

&gt; 4. Install Yosemite Sam &quot;BACK OFF&quot; mudflaps.

No, I save these for my C*evy pickup!
