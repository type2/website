Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

Jim,

Check out the front 4 or five pages of Hemmings Motor News--

There is an outfit in a big color ad selling chrome plated Halon
extinguishers---
Don't ask me anything about the ozone, when, how, or why,--it's just
there for sale if someone wants it--

I will say this though--yep it just might pollute the ozone real
bad--but so does the space suttle---more than every automobile that runs
or dumps a load of R-12 in the US every time it goes up---
But the stuff does extinguish fires, especially gas and oil fires real
fast and clean---

The space shuttle can pollute so why, oh why, can't I ?

Anyway, the deal with halon is that it's like freon. R12 type freon is
bad for the ozone, so now we use R134 or some other type. Well, Halon
1211 can be had, and it most likely works just as well. Here's a link to
a site that sells them... 

No, actually it's worse than Freon. Freon is a chlorinated fluorocarbon.
Halon is a halogenated chloroflourocarbon. Having gone to chemistry
class before they had such things, I have no idea what the significance
of this is, except that it eats the ozone layer faster than plain CFCs
do. 
If you're buying a new jetliner or a new army tank, you can still get a
Halon system--the international protocol banning HCFCs allows these two
uses until a new agent that has the same effectiveness is invented even
though they can't make halon anymore--but everyone else has to use
different agents.
