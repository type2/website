Subject: Re: [T2] Should caliper bleed screw leak?

&gt;The only thing keeping the fluid from leaking past the treads is the
&gt;labyrinth effect of the threads.  This is higly dependent upon the
&gt;clearance of the threads.  If the fit is very close, leakage will be
&gt;minimal, while looser tolerances will yield more leakage.  Considering
&gt;that modern parts tend to have looser tolerances, they would leak more
&gt;past the threads.  It doesn't have anything to do with the number of
&gt;bleeders, though.

I think the only reason I brought up the number of bleeders is that I 
believe the 1-bleeder calipers are older then the 2-bleeder type and the 
threads might be more 'worn out'.

&gt;How to reduce leakage?  Heavy grease in the threads is the only thing I
&gt;can think of.  (snip)
&gt;
I think I agree with some of the posters that leaking while bleeding by 
itself is not a too serious a problem. However I was wondering if this 
might be an indicator of  overly worn out threads. Especially 
considering the amount of fluid that leaked which seemed excessive to me 
at the time but maybe it is not a big deal. Enough fluid leaked out to 
flow down and puddle at the bottom inside of the rim, then flowed down 
the tire and started puddling on the ground. I didn't time it but it was 
probably 4-5 minutes. It sounds from some of the responses that this 
might not be that unusual.
