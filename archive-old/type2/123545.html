Subject: stuck manifold gasket

I finally found the missing manifold gasket for my T4!  Unfortunately, it was 
not until I had the engine in that I noticed it was still in the head.  I 
considered leaving it in, but there was mucho evidence of blowby, and decided to 
remove it.  BIG mistake.

It appears that this copper gasket has become one with the head, and I 
totally crapped it up trying to remove, so now leaving it in is not an option.

Can I safely put heat on it without bunging up the head?  Any and all 
suggestions would be most welcome.
