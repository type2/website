&gt;Hi Max
&gt;I've never seen the mount for the compressor, as both
&gt;the compressor and mount were missing when I bought my bus.
&gt;Like I mentioned I looked around for as much information as
&gt;I could find on the whole A/C setup but have never came
&gt;across a picture of the compressor/mount.  Anyone have a
&gt;picture of it? I'd be interested to see it also.
&gt;As for the over head unit, I got a lead from the buy &amp; sell
&gt;at type2_dot_com and I was going to use it for parts but it fell
&gt;through.  You might get lucky looking in a junk yard for
&gt;one, as I have not seen many people selling the units.
&gt;Used parts have to be out there as it wasn't just a
&gt;handful of people that had these installed on their buses.
&gt;It just seems that its not common for theses buses to
&gt;have A/C, in my experience.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;sorry I cant be of much help
&gt;Alex,

Max or Alex or anyone,

I have a '79 bus in Seattle with the overhead unit intact.  It's a dealer 
installed after-market unit from some company in Oklahoma.  The entire A/C 
system is there except for the compressor.  A PO just cut the hoses at the 
compressor and removed it.  I don't want the unit (but I want the Bus).  If 
anyone is interested I'd be willing to remove it and make a deal.  Let me 
know.

Ted
