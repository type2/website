Subject: Wood Panels for 71 Westfalia

Hi everyone.  My wife and I are proud owners of a 71 Westfalia Pop-top and
recently we started doing some restoration work on her.  We've been tackling
the inside and had some questions about the wood interior.  I understand
baltic birch plywood is a good replacement which, thankfully, I can purchase
locally here in Santa Cruz from San Lorenzo lumber.  That's great, however,
since most of the original wood is in bad shape or missing I won't be able
to use them as templates for the new wood.  Do any of you have the
demensions or is that something I can get by calling my local VW dealer.  Or
maybe there is an easier way to get fresh wood installed?  Unfortunately,
need dimensions for all panels if possible.

Thanks very much!
