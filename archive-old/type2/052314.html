Subject: Re: [T2] cv boot repair

&gt;        &quot;I was just curious if anyone had any &quot;Duct Tape&quot; type fixes until
I
&gt;get up North--Thanks for the help---Adam&quot;
&gt;
Way back when, in my days of no money, I had a boot open up on my old
T*y*ta.  That I did was wrap a long (2'?) length of truck inner tube rubber
(a piece of rubber roof membrane, called EPDM at the roofing supply shop,
would be a lot easier to work with now) around and around the outside of the
existing boot, which I left in place.  Wrap it like you were wrapping an Ace
bandage, keeping the sides even, and be sure to wrap it so the usual spin of
the axle flings water away, rather than scoops it up.  I had maybe 3 or 4
layers of rubber stacked up in the coil around the boot.  Then clamp it nice
and tight over the boot clamps with stainless steel band clamps, the ones
with the worm gears.  You have to make sure the rubber is wide enough to
allow for the up and down flex of the joint/suspension.

It might sound like a lot of work, but it only takes a few minutes each, and
mine lasted for years, that rubber is pretty good stuff.  When I finally did
get the boot replaced, a college degree later, the mechanic had a good laugh
and pointed out that the grease still looked good.

You don't need no stinkin' correct part EVERY time.
