Hello,
    I am curretly working down my job list to get poor old Isolde through
her MOT.  I failed on play in the steering (among other things) so I got
yself a new pin kit, including the phosphor bronze bushes, and I am all
ready to fit it.  However, I have now tried lots of things and I can't get
the two old bushes out.  I've tried eat ad brute force (not that I am much
of a brute) and I still can't get it. If anyone knows the knack, I would be
most grateful if they could enlighten me.
    Also, does ayone know where I might get a s/h inner door handle for my
bus, in the UK
    cheers

        Tristan and Isolde '72 van
