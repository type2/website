I know this is a FAQ, but please post the ISBN and Publisher info
for the famous Bentley book.  I have not seen it, but I read from 
the list that it is as essential (if not more) than Muir.

I checked the bibliography at
http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/publications.html
but it only has a reference to a book that &quot;contains additional procedures..&quot;
than Bentley.

The FAQ cites the Bentley book as a reference, but does not have 
a bibliography.  I need to either mail order the book or try to find 
it in Dallas.  It was hard enough to find Muir!
