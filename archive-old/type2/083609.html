 Hey Herb,  Sounds like classic symptoms of water in
the gas.  Sometimes when the filling station's tanks
are getting near empty water will condense in there
and give customers a nasty surprise.  Does this always
happen to you at the same filling station?
 The good news is that there is (probably) nothing
wrong with your engine. 
 Hope that helps.   -DreadDave
