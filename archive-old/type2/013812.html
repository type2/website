Subject: Re: Thermostat/Cooling Tin

Oops.  Sorry about suggesting replacing the tin - if I had read the next few 
messages I'd have known you didn't have heat exchangers.  And if I'd been 
thinking, I would have remembered that you've got the gas heater mounted under 
your dash.  

Oh well.  Foot in mouth.  But still, lack of the exchangers and protective tin 
should not keep you from hooking up your thermostat.  The heat from the case 
and the head and the j-pipes will be more than sufficient to open your 
thermostat long before your engine reaches normal operating temperature.

I'd be more concerned about your pushrod tubes not being protected from sticks 
and stones from underneath.
