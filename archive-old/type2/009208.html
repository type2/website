I have been informed by my mechanic that my 1800-cc FI needs a complete
rebuild.  Pending a second opinion, I am inquiring as to the availability of
a low-mileage or newly rebuilt long blocks for sale in the greater
Seattle, WA area.  New heads would be ideal, but will settle for rebuilt,
depending on price.  Also looking for independent mechanic with skills &amp;
facilities to do a full swap-out.  Willing to pay competitive prices, but
hoping to find a reliable bargain.  Can this be done for $2K?

Responses may be made to either my .sig address or to:

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
