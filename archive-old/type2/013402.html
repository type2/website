A bus engine spends most of its life around (or above)4G - why not
counterweight?  I think it makes perfect sense.

Everyone i've talked to says &quot;...if you don't run a counterweighted crank,
then don't see much above 4G...&quot;

Well, in my 71 with the 5.38 tranny, 4g is probably gonna put me at about 60. 
With the counterweight, i wouldn't worry so hard about seeing 5G...

my .02,

you can buy a brand new 1600 VW engine for a little over $1000 and get
fuel injection and hydraulic valves,  that would be my first choice 

&gt; The firs thing I want to choice is the crankshaft.  Is a new
counterweighted
&gt; cast crank better than a used stock VW crank?  Remember, I want a long
&gt; lasting stock engine.  so the counterweighted crank sounds better to lower
&gt; internal vibration once everyting well balanced.

at normal driving speeds a counterweighted crank really does not help that
much, spend the same money on balancing the stock crank and you will have
very smooth engine.

counterweighted crank is usefull at 8000rpm
