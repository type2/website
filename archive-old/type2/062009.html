&gt;     I went to some body shops to see how much it would cost to get the 65's body

&gt; something I can take to shows and bring home trophys with. I went to three
&gt; places, one said it'd take 5-6 weeks and cost between 5 and 6000 bucks. Another
&gt; said a month and a half and cost 6000. The third said she'd be off the road for
&gt; 12 - 14 MONTHS and cost 12,000 dollars!  Yes the comma IS in the right place.
&gt; Umm, any thoughts on this? I am definately willing to spend 6 - 8,000 to get
&gt; this done, but 12,000? I don't think so Tim.

Yes, this is the type of price I would expect from a body shop, 
depending on the repairs needed. 10 years ago, local shops were getting 
$1200 to $2000 to repaint the outside of a car, with guarantees of good 
quality. These costs would double when they were looking at painting the 
inside of a vehicle as well.

When you get ready to make a decision, you will want to make sure they 
know you are serious. Dress neatly and speak in a professional manner. 
State that you ARE going to have your VW van restored. When some &quot;kid&quot; 
comes up and states he has this 30 year old &quot;wreck&quot; he wants restored, 
they will tend to blow you off. Their time costs money. They'll look at 
the car, but won't give serious answers unless they are sure this is for 
real. (I've been on the other side. You'd be surprised how many folks 
roll up in a 15 year old beater, and want you to spend 30 minutes giving 
them a written estimate... when you know the car isn't worth the price 
of the estimate.) If you state your case seriously, they will 
usually take you seriously.

Then, when they are serious, you can inquire (politely) about their 
company.

Some hints that might come in handy:

1. Get referrals. A restore shop should have several cars they can 
recommend. If possible, look at a repaint that was done several years 
ago. This will show you how well their paint jobs hold up. Is it 
flaking, cracking or chipping. You might want to check into a few of 
their &quot;cheap&quot; repairs. Are they holding up as well as the rest of the 
paint? In today's shops, a repaint can be done that is BETTER than 
original factory.

2. Ask about their equipment, and get a look around the shop. (BTW, 
listen when they talk about their equipment. The good shops are proud of 
having the latest in tools... and they'll probably come off with 
something like, &quot;Yes, we installed the Binford 4500 refinishing system 
last year.&quot; Oh yes, they don't have paint booths, but refinishing 
systems. &lt;grin&gt;) The shop, and employees should present a neat 
appearance. Gone are the days of wearing the same stained coveralls for 
days at a time, with piles of rusted fenders thrown in the corner, with 
floors covered in dirt. Body work is dirty, but the dirt should look 
&quot;fresh&quot;. Equipment should be modern, especially when it comes to the 
paint booth. In the last 5 years, great strides have been made in paint 
application, which has required replacing booths, etc, at staggering 
costs (passed on to customers). Ok, some of the best paintjobs I've seen 
(custom work) were done out of a rickety 5 car garage... but this guy 
was an artist and excentric, not your standard shop. You can use your 
best judgement on this one. You might also want to check around the 
local hotrod hangouts. If there's a good shop in town, they will know 
about it.

3. When you have your shop(s) picked out, take your van in for a full 
estimate. Some shops charge for this service, but it is usually taken 
off the estimate when you choose their shop ($50 is a fair price). Ask 
in advance what they charge for this service. If they take you 
seriously, and know you are choosing between 2 or 3 local shops, they 
might waive the fee, in the interest of making a serious bid. Some shops 
will also want a deposit before beginning a job this large. This is 
negotiable, and not usually over 25% of the total cost... and be careful 
of giving advances to some guy working out of a small shop... my dad 
lost out that way.

4. You can sometime save money by letting them do the work at their best 
pace. This means your van will sit for several weeks, but get them to 
set a time limit (and don't be surprised if it takes 25% longer than 
their estimate). If they can schedule it around their lull times, this 
makes the job easier for them. Also, many shops don't like doing this 
kind of work. A good resto shop can turn around a job like this in a 
week, but this requires a full time effort to get it out the door (plus 
time needed for heavy rust/body damage).

5. When you both come to an understanding, get it in writing. All good 
shops will do this, plus give an estimate of completion time. It's not 
unreasonable for you to stop in occasionally to see how things are 
going, but you won't want to push it. Remember, these guys are busy and 
you don't want to rush them needlessly. A good rule of thumb is to stop 
in at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the completion date. If they haven't 
started at 25%, you might get concerned... and so forth.

Before the estimate, there are jobs you can do. If nothing else, clean 
the van. Take it down to the 2-bit car wash and clean it, inside, 
out and underneath... and don't forget the engine compartment. Take a 
toothbrush, and get 30 year's accumlation from those cracks and 
crevices. Pull the panels, exposing any hidden damage. If possible, 
clean up any rust and prime the surface neatly. Pull the seats. Do 
anything you can to make the van look its best, and make their job 
easier. If you are good at body work, fixing the rust and dents can save 
money, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are sure of what you are 
doing. In a simple word, do anything you can to make the van more 
presentable. This will add credence to your claims, and can knock 
serious bucks off your estimate.
