&gt; &gt; So ive heard everything from needing a 20inch one to a 24 inch one. I havent

&gt; 
&gt; NO :-( 19&quot; is not high enough.  mine goes to 19 1/2&quot; and if I put it under

same here, I cheat since mine has a drop floor and a frame braket to the
lowered section I put the jack there and get the extra 8 inches, but I
would rather have the longer working length.

&gt; In my opinion, 24&quot; is the majic number, honest!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ive been doing some shopping around and ive heard of people carrying this 
&gt; &gt; SUV specific set that includes the jackstands as well, but havent been able 
&gt; &gt; to find one yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Barry Burneskis found this set, nice jack stands and a 24&quot; jack, on sale
&gt; at ?K-Mart? some time last year and posted it to the list.  I did not take
&gt; advantage because I had a jack and stands. Since then I have seen what
&gt; Barry bought and I am kicking myself every time I use mine.  I strongly
&gt; recommend looking 'til you find the right jack.  

same here, I wish I had run to Kmart and grabed a set.
&gt; 
&gt; Harbor Freight has one that is nearly perfect! Alas, while it lifts to
&gt; 30&quot;, it is 54&quot; long and weighs 138 lb... plus it is $150.  Their site is:

another jack that I highly recomend is the small 4 wheeled transmission
jack, got mine from Harbor Freight, not production quality but does do the
job well,  recently took my 2 liter FI engine out and put it back in ALONE
in less time than I ever was able to do it with 2 or 3 people and a jack.
(and if you've met me you know what I mean)

made an angle iron bracket to support the engine and viola!  tilt and jack
and work stand to boot.  Don't know how I got along without it for so
long.
