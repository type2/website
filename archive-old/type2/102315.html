Subject: RE: 1600 in a 72 bus???

John it is possible and should bolt right in but the tranny is bolted to
the bus with two small bolts and uses the engine bracket mainly to
support the tranny and engine.  I did buy a 76 bus once that had a
upright engine in it and the two bolts is all the PO used, kind of scary
thinking about it after the fact.  I have heard of being able to make a
bracket out of black pipe but do not have any specs on how to do that.
I believe it needs to be bent so much and each end is flattened and
drilled.  I might be able to get more info on this if that is what you
want to do.

Haven't you got that darn engine started yet?

Kevin

Is it possible to put a 1600 DP engine into a 72 bus with no major
re-structuring?  Would the 1600 engine bolt up right with the 72 Tranny?
