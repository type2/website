Subject: Re: [T2] firing order

Dan
when in doubt just verify your basics, sound like dist drive is 180 out.
Verify by pulling the valve cover and sparkplug on # 1. Make sure its #1,
you want the passenger side front. Watch your valves as you turn the motor
over clockwise, you want to verify that you have tdc on the compression
stroke. Watch the intake valve as you rotate your engine, watch it open up,
as it starts to close put a dowel or long screwdriver into the sparkplug
hole. Continue to rotate the engine, hold the dowel with your other hand and
you can feel where it stops moving and starts to go back inside, now your at
tdc on the compression stroke. Pop your dist cap, where are the rotor and
the notch on the dist body? Notch on the dist body should be at about 4 o
clock and the rotor should be pointed at it. If the dist notch is at 4
oclock and the rotor is at 11 oclock, dist is 180 out. Time to pull dist and
dist drive and try again.btw where the notch is, is where #1 sparkplug goes
and you put em on clockwise from there.
