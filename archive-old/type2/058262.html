Subject: Tranny tools???

Anybody know where the special tools needed to rebuild a VW tranny
can be purchased? Given the apparant scarcity of used ones, and having a
bit of spare time at the moment, I'm thinking of giving it a go. I've
rebuilt many car, truck, and tractor tranny's, but never one needing all
the fancy tools before.
