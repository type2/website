Subject: Trip Report - Holland (Part 2)

After the Southern England - Amsterdam drive, the Amsterdam -
Venlo drive was a breeze. We arrived at the EuroMeet showground
in the pouring rain on Friday afternoon. We were given some
fluorescent badges, a programme, and a cool plastic bumper sign 
(in a number-plate styley) which is still precariously attached to Splitty's 
bumper with string.

The showground was actually a big speedway track right next
to a camping site. Split screen buses from the U.K. filled up 
nearly a whole field, and were packed in there pretty cosy-like.
We camped next to Glen and Lene Swanson (from the list) and their 
gob-smackingly gorgeous 1961 microbus.

We spent most of Saturday checking out the trade stands which
were numerous and well-stocked with aircooled goodies. A
substantial part of this time was spent with Glen and Lene as
they had quite a bit of stuff to sell, and needed help pulling sheets
of plastic over the wares every time the heavens opened! Damon
soon had his beady eyes on Glen's Eberspacher (sp?) heater, oval
bug headlight lenses, and Blaupunkt radio. I am pleased to
report that these items are now residing in our sitting room, and
await their final resting places in Damon's '59 bug. 

Clara had made her own way to the show, and met up with Brian
Verbeek (another list member) whom we caught a glimpse of
(wearing his list t-shirt, Richard!) before he scurried off into the rain. 
Sadly, by this time, our financial situation was dire, as we had not 
anticipated the poor exchange rate and the expensive-ness of Holland. 
Therefore I was unable to buy any goodies apart from the ubiquitous 
'frites met mayo'. And I was also forced (not really) to sell my spotless 
1957 'Accessories' brochure to some Germans.

One side the speedway was devoted to drag-racing the object
of which seemed to be suicide or manslaughter. There was almost
no run-out. The only safety precaution was a large pile of sand at
the end of the run - directly behind which a steady stream of spectators 
meandered. This would be dangerous enough without the fact that
heavy showers persisted throughout the day. No ambulances or
medical team that we could see either... Still, this made exciting viewing
from a safe position! They certainly have some souped-up split
rear window bugs over there...! (actually, alot of them were a split
window bug body on a something). Amazingly, no-one crashed into
the sand, although there was alot of brake-squeeling and sliding
around.

Despite our poverty, we had a very nice Saturday evening. 
Glen &amp; Lene turned their bus round so we had our cargo doors 
facing, and we had dinner at their picnic table in between the two 
buses. Dinner was an interesting affair, consisting of lukewarm 
pasta &amp; chilli veg sauce compiled by moi, a large tin of 'Suzi Wan' 
chinese noodles heated, in the can, over the barbecue, supplied by 
the Swansons, chicken kebabs (wildly incinerated by a salmonella-
paranoid Damon), salami, salad and fruit tart. 

This multi-cultural fayre became curiously palatable after the crate 
of duty-free beer and bottles of duty-free wine we consumed. At this
point Lee Griffiths (yet another list member) wobbled up on his BMX.
Hope the hangover was easy on Lee for Sunday when he was showing
his samba.
We also had a peek at the 'disco' laid on for the VW dudes &amp; dudettes.
Hmmm. We listened to a selection of 2 songs -- Rage Against The
Machine's popular ditty entitled &quot;AARRGGGHGETRREEHG&quot;, and U2's
lighter-waving-inducing &quot;With or without you&quot;. Preferably without you 
Bono. We swiftly retreated.

Sadly, we had to leave the show at 8am Sunday morning. Shame to
miss the Sunday which would have been the climax of a great show.

Interesting vehicles of the weekend: one of those weird postal delivery
VW van things -- the rear end of a splitty, a small, angled sliding door,
and the kind of truck-shaped front end that strongly suggested the
engine was carried at the fore. I remember seeing one in a book, never
one in real life tho'. 

Also a high-roof splitty, with what looked like original sign-writing, 
with a hatch instead of cargo doors. There were even bottles of ketchup
&amp; mayo on the table bit of the hatch. Cool. 

Drive back through Belgium &amp; France was non-eventful. Stopped over
in Lymington for the night then on to Bristol.

As we drew up to our house, the speedo read EXACTLY (no kidding)
1,300 miles since we left Bristol.
