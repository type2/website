&gt; Could someone check their owner's manual and let me know what amp fuse goes

Greg,

If you point a browser at:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com

and then go to the wiring diagrams at:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html

and then select the '73-75 diagram at:

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-73-75.jpg

and look at it after it downloads (a consderable period of time) at the
index over on the right side of the diagram, you will find that the heater
blower motor is on current track #5.  Going back to current track #5, you
find the heater blower motor (V4) with a yellow wire/black stripe going up
to the relay that controls it.  from that relay a red wire will emerge and
go to fuse S25, a white(8 amp) fuse.  from the fuse holder, a second red
wire leads off to the starter motor.

The relay is controlled by the switch up front (E16, current track 4),
which should have a brown wire with a white stripe.  The power for that
switch comes from the voltage regulator and is not fused at all.

If your heater blower is not working, check the fuse, obviously, but also
check that you got all the wires attached to the starter motor.  In later
years, there is quite a forest of wires attached to terminal 30 on the
starter motor, and the bus really needs all of them to run.  I tend to
bring a zip-tie down under with me when I am taking that terminal apart to
tie all the wires together (they are all ring terminals) as I remove them.
