Subject: Engine Removal

Volks:
I recently obtained a 71 Westy. I want to remove the engine and being 
completely new to Buses I was planning on using the directions on Muir's 
book. after reading a few times, it sounds pretty simple, but before I get 
started, I will love to hear from people who tried first. Any hints or 
pointers will be greatly appreciated. Best regards

Victor
