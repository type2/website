Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY - Keeping Warm

&gt; So, as a Friday thing, I wanted to get some ideas from The List on how
&gt; cold-weather folks keep warm while they work outside.  So far I've tried to
&gt; bundle up, put on gloves and wool socks, drink hot tea, get a heater, and
&gt; take frequent warm-up breaks.  Short of having a heated garage, this is
&gt; about the best I can do.

Something I always find helpful when lying on the ground (and let's face it,
how many bus jobs are there where you don't have to lie on your back?):  Get
a large cardboard box, flatten it and lie on that.  Very comfy.  Ideally you
want a double or triple wall box, the sort of size a flatpack cupboard or
washing machine might come in.
