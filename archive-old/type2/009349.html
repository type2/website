Hilo,

I have an awning I bought from a VW recycler in SoCal about 6 months
ago.  I took it out from under the house (vw stockpile) and dusted it
off and remembered why I hadn't already installed it.  I need the
brackets that mount to the roof of the bus and the back of the aluminum
housing of the awning.  Anyone know where I can get these brackets?  I
could make some if I knew what the dimensions are.  Anyone have an
awning installed that can measure them and send the dimensions to me? 
Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.  

Tony in Vista, CA 72 Westy (Bus is his name).....73 Thing (Ring Thing
cuz when I'm done with it I have to sell it and pay for an engagement
ring)
