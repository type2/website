I am not  100% sure I understand your question (the +/- one inch thing is
throwing me  a bit) but the pilot bearing is flush with the front (flywheel
end) of the  crankshaft. In other words, if you remove the flywheel from the
crank, the  pilot bearing is right there, flush with that surface 


hey guys  On 914 motors the pilot stays in the flywheel. Now on type 4  
motors it is in the crank. There is suppose to be a felt seal there also   later
