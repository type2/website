Subject: Re: [T2] Weird thumping noise when driving

You might experiment by switching the thumping tire to the other side (left
for right, right for left) and see if the noise moves;  that would be a good
indication that the wheel / tire is the problem and not the CV joint.
Re-capped tires are less and less available here in the U.S. - maybe you'll
hear from folks in other parts of the world where they're available and are
more familar with them, but I recall that treads starting to separate will
make thumping or unusual noises.

Good luck.

Hi,


Yes my wheels are balanced - 'twas the first thing I did when I
bought the Bus - we have to take a yearly inspection here in
Portugal, and that's one thing that really makes a difference for the
examiners (though the one's that did mine kept giggling - go figure ;-
)!). By the way, my tires are recapped... I still haven't the ?'s to buy
new/decent ones... :-( But they are balanced alright!
For what I read it makes perfect sense to be faulty CV joints - I'll
check them out this weekend - Many thanks for all your help!
I'll keep you guys informed!



Later,
