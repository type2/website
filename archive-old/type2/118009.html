&lt;&lt; I guess it depends on how you define &quot;junk&quot; and &quot;top of the line
accessories.&quot;  JC Whitney sells Bosch, EMPI, Hella, Neuspeed, PIAA,
Pertronix, Scat, Sewfine, TMI, and West Coast Metric amongst many other
brands.   &gt;&gt;

FWIW, Home Depot sells Ridgid plumbing tools, but the Ridgid name is on
some made-in-China electric tools...The Klein electricians tools at my 
electric supply store are made in USA, the Klein tools at Home Depot are
not...I usta have faith in &quot;brand names&quot; but too many companies have 
followed Philip Knight's (CEO of Nike) lead... Once you've got a marketable
name; stick it on whatever you've got...They'll buy it...
