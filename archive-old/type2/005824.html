Phil,

I am amazed at the amount of trouble you are going to.
I drilled a hole in the floor above the tank looked through it  to establish
where the sender was, then cut a hole in the floor above the sender, after
replacing the sender I made a patch for the floor out of annealed copper so
it could be shaped with a hammer to fit the ribs in the floor and secured it
with self tapping screws in case I need to use it again.

Guess im a bit late with this idea sorry.
