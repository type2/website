&gt; Expanding this hypothesis to the entire automobile industry, why are
&gt; Lucas electric systems more likely to leak smoke than, say. Bosch or
&gt; Delco? Aha! Lucas is British. Things British always leak! British
&gt; convertible tops leak water. British engines leak oil. British shock
&gt; absorbers leak fluid. Naturally, British electronics leak smoke.
&gt; 
&gt;    Many years ago, Joseph Lucas attempted to rectify this inherent
problem with British electrics by appearing before Parliament and
sponsoring a bill to repeal Ohm's Law...Alas and alack, he met with
too much resistance... ;-(
