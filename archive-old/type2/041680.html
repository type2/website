Subject: Fuel System Blues - Stuck in Everett and beyond - A Rant

Thanks for all the help on my fuel delivery problem last weekend.  Here's
how it all came out:
Saturday - 
 * Bus is lurching and losing power on the freeway
 * buy and replaced fuel filter with one from NAPA
 * bus runs better
 * hours later there is fuel dripping steadily from a hose under the engine
 * stay night in bus
Sunday - 
  * the fuel leaking hose is the breather hose off of my mechanical fuel
pump
  * Inside the engine compartment, the front cover on my rt solex carb has
pitched 2 screws and
     the cap has rotated around allowing the hot wire from the coil to the
cap to touch the
     grounded linkage.  Wire is burnt to a crisp, melting into other wires.
  * There are wires everywhere in the engine compartment that lead to
nothing anymore, some of
     which are still live and uncapped.  The PO apparently having decided to
rewire almost
     everything, but leaving the old wire there, in some fashion, just in
case.
  * Buy a electronic fuel pump, new wire, etc.  from NAPA
  * Install pump, bypassing old one, and replace some fuel line.
  * Replace fried wire to carb and
  * Drive back to Seattle
Monday - 
  * Walk out door on way to work and see huge puddle of gas under the bus
spilling out onto
     the street.  Call in sick, change clothes, crawl under bus.
  * New pump is fine, all hoses clamped tight, gas is dripping from multiple
locations up higher.
  * Inspect engine, fuel is dripping steadily from the rt carb, and draining
out all over the engine
     on the rt side.
  * Vice grip the fuel line to the rt carb.  Roll bus away from huge gas
spill.
  * New term added to my bus vocabulary: fuel pressure regulator: mentioned
by my favorite
     mechanic who is way to far away to get too and doesn't work Sundays.
Catch up with the
     Type2 list, where the term is also being used, but the posts didn't
show up until late Sunday
     night, though they were posted long before then.  This happens quite
frequently actually.
  * Manage to find a close mechanic shop who's worked on VW's before,
although they specialize
     in Porsche.
  * Fire extinguisher in hand, I gently drive my bus to the shop, 10 blocks
away, with the Vicegrip
     still blocking fuel to the right carb.  I tell them to find and fix the
leak, but that I was going to
     put in another mechanical fuel pump myself.  It was going to cost the
same amount of money
     for a fuel pressure regulator as it was to get a new mechanical fuel
pump, so I decided to go
     mechanical for a couple of reasons.  Ask me if you care.  I took my
motorcycle, which thankfully
     was running down to the wrecking yard and got a good used pump for $15.
  * $20 in parts, $110 in labor (_at_$76/hr) later, it turns out the needle
valve needed replacing,
     and they replaced the oil and oil filter to make sure no gas got into
it.  They checked the
     pressure on the electronic fuel pump and it was a steady 3PSI.  My new
mechanical fuel pump
     was for naught other than simple preference now.

I don't know what the moral here is exactly but it sure seems like if you
fix anything, you must also fix everything that is connected to it too.
Change a horseshoe? Ha!  Change the horse too!

Some weekends you just can't win.  Fortunately there are only 52 of those
per year. ;p
