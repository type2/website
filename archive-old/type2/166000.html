&gt; It doesn't look like Brainard Lake is going to work out

so brainard doesn't open for another month.  the plan is to scope out 
reverend's ridge camp site at golden gate state park in coal creek 
canyon (near golden).  If that isn't a go the backup plan is moraine 
park campground inside of RMNP.  that's the estes park side.  if that is 
full or for some reason not available (it's open all year and this is 
pre-camping season still) the backup plan is a privately run campground 
and rv place (yeah yeah.  rv's.  blah) just outside the fall river road 
entrance to RMNP.  here's a link to their site.
