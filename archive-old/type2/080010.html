Subject: Re: [T2] heating project? (using propane)

Hi Roger- I'd get a low oxygen sensor; propane burns clean-Only water
and CO2 is released. (especially cataytic), so no CO worries unless you
are burning an orange flame.  I use a stove that has the burner on top
of the squat tank; it stands on the floor for cooking.
The separate tanks stay warm enough to work fine if kept in the bus with
you.  I wonder if your regulator works right; shouldn't it accomodate
pressure changes due to cold gas?

&gt; 
&gt; I've got a catalytic propane heater (and CO/smoke detector) in my
&gt; Westfalia, and I've had some troubling problems with propane gas flow in
&gt; colder temperatures.  It seems that as the outside air temp drops, so
&gt; does the flow of propane.  Sometimes it's so bad that flow completely
&gt; stops(!), which kinda stinks when you're looking forward to cooking a
&gt; meal inside a toasty warm van after skiing all day (and not to mention
&gt; that the stove won't work because the propane stopped flowing).  So what
&gt; gives?
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the propane in the tank is in liquid form and converted to a
&gt; vapor when released from the tank, which leads to this story:
&gt; 
&gt; One summer not so long ago I had the valve and regulator replaced on the
&gt; westy's propane tank.  The technician at the propane supply shop burned
&gt; off a lot of the propane before removing any tank components; I say a
&gt; lot because it didn't seem to burn long enough to have emptied the
&gt; tank.  I asked him this while he was unhooking the burn hose and
&gt; starting to pull the valve stem; he said, &quot;Well, if you let it escape
&gt; fast enough, it will get cold enough that no gas will escape, and so no
&gt; need to burn it all off.&quot;  (I nodded politely and made my way to the
&gt; back of the bus.)
&gt; 
&gt; So as the propane gas escapes, the temperature inside the tank drops
&gt; (ever seen the frozen condensation on the exterior of a 1 lb. propane
&gt; bottle after running a tabletop grill for a spell?).  Now in my
&gt; situation, not only is the ambient (outside) air colder, but the system
&gt; is also refrigerating itself as a byproduct of the state change (liquid
&gt; -&gt; vapor).
&gt; 
&gt; So is this the nature of propane and cold climates, or is something
&gt; wrong?  Could it be too cold (atmospheric) to change the propane from a
&gt; liquid to a vapor?  Could the propane be freezing itself given the
&gt; temperature drop associated with use?  Is there a solution?  It was
&gt; mentioned previously that many RV's use similar setups for heat, so what
&gt; plagues my situation such that it falters or fails?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; Their is a company in the UK that makes a propane heater just like the old
&gt; &gt; gas ones.
