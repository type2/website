&gt;If I read this right the 009 isn't a good choice for my 73' 1.8L setup.  If
&gt;this is the case, which dizzy is the right one for my
&gt;FI type four?

Interesting question, Brian. First, there were no fuel injected 1.8L engines
in 1973 US models. If you had the  correct 1.7 L engine, you already have the
correct distributor, sort of. Bosch calls for 0231 173 009 for 73 1.7L MT , but
lists several others as well.
The  74-75 FI 1.8L engine has several possibilities, you must sort out.
Start with www.oldvolkshome_dot_com and the type 2 library distributor info.
