Subject: Re: [T2] Dumbest camping thing I have ever done

Jeepers, TBear, if THAT's the dumbest camping thing you've ever done, 
you need to do more camping. Dumbest thing I ever did was when I was 
patrol leader (Boy Scouts, circa 1964) and let the other guys in my 
patrol mix the powdered hot chocolate and the powdered eggs to speed up 
breakfast.

What will compound your error is if you don't get in your bus RIGHT NOW 
and go camping!
