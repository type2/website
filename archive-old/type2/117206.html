Subject: Westy Electical Panel Source

Does anyone have a source for new westy panels. The one for a 78' with the
fridge controls. Specifically the timer switch and the battery tester seem
to be shot on mine. I though I remember someone like go westy sellign these
at a pretty penny but I have not seen any on their site. Nor Busted bus_dot_com

Thanks,

Ted Reshetiloff
78&quot; Westy Possum
