Subject: engine value

Hello 
     My dad is thinking of selling the engine out of his 76 westy since he's
converted it to an upright. We only paid $250 for it and its been off the
road about 6 years. Before we took it out we got it running on the day we
got it home. it is fuel injected and when it was running it was smoking and
makeing a 
noise. It is a complete engine so if anyone knows what they think this might
be worth and what maybe the fuel pump is worth your analysis is appreciated.

Thanx in advance
