&gt; Hi Bob and all,
&gt;     I agree with your idea of installing fi (fuel injection) back on the 76.  While installing the fi system use one from a 79 - 83
&gt; type 2 California system t2 or t3 (bus or van) .  These systems have many advantages/ advances.

I tend to recommend the same year as the motor when possible, however this
one has a nonstock cam so ?????  don't know which one is best.

VW made a fair amount of running changes in the FI system in the late 70's
so keeping it stock tends to reduce headaches, such as having one side of
a plug 6 pins and the other side 7 pins (true experience)

&gt; Weber 40 IDF or some type of single carb. I'm open to suggestions. My goals are reliability, reasonable perfomamce and mpg. Thanks
