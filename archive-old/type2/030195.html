&gt; 	Please allow me to chime in once more on this thread.  Like any
&gt; other 'performance' oriented service product, the K&amp;N air filter requires
&gt; REGULAR maintenance.  I know it tells you on the box that it will last for
&gt; 100,00 miles, but then so do the platinum spark plug boxes.  The issue at
&gt; hand is the regulart cleaning and (here's the clincher everyone) re-oiling
&gt; of the filter!  What a shocker!  The oil used on the pleated gauze is very
&gt; light, and as such gets drawn out of the filter over time.

Very true.  It doesn't so much get drawn out as it gets soaked out by the
dust that sticks to the filter.

&gt; This must be
&gt; replaced from time to time.  I have a feeling that in many of the engines
&gt; described with premature internal wear, that the issue was one of sealing
&gt; not filtration.  K&amp;N makes a sealing grease to correct this  often
&gt; overlooked issue.  Just MHO.

Sealing is important, but in most cases the main concern is the amount of
particulate trapped by the filter.  

Here is a rundown of the various filter types:

A paper filter works by carefully
controlling the pore size in the paper.  Like a sieve, nothing will get
through that is larger than the pores.  Unfortunately, in blocking a piece
of particulate, that particular pore is no longer in service so the filter
will clog easily in dusty conditions.  Such filters are great for street
use where they won't encounter much dust.  Later model VWs came with paper
filters for this reason.

The other approach is to offer the particulate many opportunities to be
trapped in a filter with much larger pore openings.  The air travels
through a long convoluted path and each bend presents an oily surface to
trap particles.  large particles are easily trapped because they don't go
around corners easily.  Smaller particles aren't as easily trapped because
they tend to stay in the air and there are a lot  more of them.  An oil
bath filter is a good example of this type.  large particles are trapped
in the first turn over the oil, and the smaller ones are presented with
many opportunities to stick to the oily excelsior fibers as the air passes
through several inches of it.  The excelsior is self-cleaning as the oil
tends to flow back to the bath over time.  Oil bath filters are tolerant
of dusty environments because of this self-cleaning tendency.  Earlier VWs
were intended to be used in dusty environments, so the oil bath filters
were supplied despite their high cost.

Another dust-tolerant filter is the cyclone type.  Used on heavy
equipment, it spins the air around in a circle and uses the inerta of the
dust particles to separate the more massive particles.  The smaller
particles are taken care of by a paper filter.  These filters tend to be
quite large, so you often see them externally mounted on trucks and heavy
equipment.  After the Mt.St. Helens eruption, the Washington highway
patrol mounted these filters on the crash bars of their patrol cars to
deal with the fine volcanic dust that was swirling about.

Oiled gauze filters like the K&amp;N trap particulates on a film of oil.  The
bad news about this method is that the filtering path is measured in
millimeters, since this is the thickness of the gauze layers.  This short
distance limits the number of opportunites for trapping particles.  K&amp;N
makes a big thing of the fact that their filters actually work better when
dirty, but this is a function of the narrowing of the air passages through
the gauze.  Kind of a microsoft &quot;it's not a bug, it's a feature&quot;
arguement.

Oiled foam filters work on a similar principle as oiled gauze, but the air
path is longer and more convoluted.  They clean better than oiled gauze 
but are more prone to clogging.
