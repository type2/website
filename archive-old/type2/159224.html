Subject: Free bus

I have a 65 'project bus' that, due to the peculiar twists and turns of 
life, I will soon not have the space for.  I would like to give this bus 
to someone who will resurrect it.  I also have many of the metal pieces 
it would take to make it whole again but because the parts cost me I'd 
have to ask $300 for them.  Or come buy the metal bits and leave the bus 
behind.

The bus is located near Lenoir, NC.  This offer stands until 07/10/06 
noon eastern time then she's off to the crusher.  I may get the chance 
to take some pix but don't count on it.

Mad Uncle Dave
