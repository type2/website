Hi,

I Bought some nice Jalousie windows(garden variety three pane) from  Crazy
DaveE at EveryBus. I am gonna install them in the '72 Westfakia. I was
advised to drill holes in the window frame of the bus and use common sheet
metal screws for the install. It appears that the screws just lock
themselves into the track in the Jal window frame.  Does anyone have any
advice on what size screws work best? Also, are there any galvanic
consideration when chooseing the screws?

If you have done the convertion from regular bus glass to Jalousie windows
please feel free to share your experiences and caveats!

I also got a childs cot and am awaiting the support clips and screws. I have
been told that this install can be a bit tricky. I would appreciate any
advice on this matter as well.
