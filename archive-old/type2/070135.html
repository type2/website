Subject: Sawzall(tm) a Milwalkee trademark

        Sawzall is a trademark of Milwalkee(sp?) Tools. VERY nice
machines if mayhem is your goal. One year my Odessey Of The Mind team
were making sheetmetal pieces The Night Before The Big Contest and the
cops came twice... called by the siren song of the Sawzall in heavy
gauge sheetmetal... lawdy what a noise!!
