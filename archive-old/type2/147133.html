Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Hot Air

Kudos to Karl for having the mind of a steel trap, able to recall 
information better than Google (and for responding almost as quickly), 
and Richard for his outstanding website; more complete and put together 
than Amazon. I looked all over for that info, Karl. Thank you.

The engine tin in the photos is the same on both CA engines I have. 
Coincidence is a high probability, since they're both from the bay area. 
Still got me stumped, though, without a fiche. Anybody see anything 
wrong with leaving it as-is? Maybe blowing hot air across the cat. 
converter is a good thing.

Karl, what can we work out on the left heat exhaust pipe? I'm 
interested. I have a '79 CA Westy to dispose of.
