Me too would love to hear more about this! Is this the VW 
remanufacturing place out in Scarborough on Eglinton Ave? I 
was pretty sure that had ben shut down.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm taking a day off tomorrow to drive the 400 KM to 
Toronto to visit a 
&gt; &gt;VW remanufacturing plant.   It deals with engines.  I 
discovered rebuild 
&gt; &gt;stickers on the engine I found in the 73 part van, called 
the plant and 
&gt; &gt;they invited me to come down and have a look!  So, I am.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hey Barry I would relly like to hear all about the plant 
and the visit.
&gt; Specially since I am in Toronto every day. Can you post 
all the
&gt; details...and some sample prices?
