Subject: RE: [T2] dash vents sizes

&gt; I have some vent s that came from yhe wall behind my seats....
&gt; are these vents the same size as that of the dash vents also...

Yes, the directional air vents that mount in the bulkhead behind
your drivers and passenger side seats are identical to those on your
dash.  Removing them for comparison takes literally seconds as they
just slip into their tube housings both in the dash and the
bulkheads.  If they are stiff sliding out, then odds are that they
have not been played with in awhile and just need to be rotated
either clockwise or counter clockwise (as VW intended) to loosen
them up a bit, to get the play needed to just slide them out.
Fiddle with them and be careful as not to force them.
