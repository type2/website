You are having a problem with the pipe between the heater box and flapper
valve, correct?

Your info on the year differences is wrong.

72 to 74 and 79 Fed version have ROUND holes in the heater box end and
corresponding ROUND tubes.

75 to 78 have OVAL holes in the heater box end and OVAL pipes.

In order to use the 72 to 74 boxes on your 78, you need the 72-74 ROUND
pipes.


&gt;  I have
&gt; the 72-74 style heat/exhaust system on my bus as you all know.  THe pipe
&gt; that go from heat exchanger to the flapper boxes on the drivers side are
&gt; supposedly the same for 72-79 but they do not fit properly on my bus, a
&gt; 78.  the piece of metal that goes to the engine tin to support the pipe
&gt; does not meet up with the tin if attached to the exchanger, or if hooked
&gt; up to the exchanger does not meet up with the tin.  My thoughts are
&gt; either:
&gt; A. there is a different drivers side pipe for 72-74 (the one i have is
&gt; off a 76)
&gt; or
&gt; B. mine is somewhat damaged and warped.
&gt;
&gt; when the pipe is on the tin it is about 2'' away from the exchanger
&gt; outlet.   I am tired of dealing with the damn heat and this is the last
&gt; major hurdle ( I hope, i get almost no airflow to the front but i assume
&gt; that is because only one side is connected, any thoughts)  I am anxious
&gt; to put the FI back in as soon as i get the heat squared away.  I
&gt; estimating 3-4 hours to put the FI back in. I've removed a complete FI
&gt; system in 1 hour.
&gt; If someone has a later and earlier style heat tube could they compare
&gt; them and tell me if they see a difference?
&gt; Any thoughts on anything mentioned here are welcome.
