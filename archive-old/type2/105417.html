&gt; Mike has it right, based on my experience building model airplanes.  There
&gt; have been occasions where I needed to &quot;undo&quot; a joint made with CA/superglue.
&gt; What worked for me was to keep it wet with acetone for a long time, like,
&gt; hours, in some cases.  This is easier said than done, as acetone evaporates
&gt; quite rapidly.  But, in the end, it worked every time.  My technique usally
&gt; involoves wrapping the joint in plastic to slow the evaporation of the
&gt; acetone.  So, I would suggest that you not give up just yet.  Use one of the
&gt; acetone bearing products you have, apply liberally, cover with plastic and
&gt; be patient.  This stuff WILL dissolve, but it takes time.

I use a lot of CA adhesives with my students (I buy the stuff by the
quart!) and would be very cautious trying to get it out of upholstery with
acetone.  With my luck, I'd put a big hole in the upholstery before I got
the CA out!

I have Levi's that have CA on them and know that the CA survived many
machine washings.  That stuff is tough!
