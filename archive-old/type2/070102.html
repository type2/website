&gt;&gt; I think your problem here is that '71 Westys came with an icebox, NOT a
&gt;&gt; fridge.  So if you're waiting for it to cool on it's own, it may take awhile.

&gt;Pat et al,

&gt;A neighbor with a '71 (second owner) informs me that his *fridge* came
&gt;stock with the bus. That leads me to believe that there was a fridge
&gt;option on the '71's. I'm a little jealous, but not much. My fridge is in
&gt;the garage and a toolbox sits in it's place. MUCH more use for the tools.

Hmm.  None of the literature I've seen (sales, parts list, camper owner's
supplement) mention a real fridge.  Is the bus that the fridge came out of
a Westy or another conversion?  Maybe it was a dealer option.  I guess my
views are the same as yours:  a little jealous but not much.  (MY toolbox is
under the rear-facing seat.  :-) )
