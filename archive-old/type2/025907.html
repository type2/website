First I am not buying the 78 westy - too many things to do this summer and
not enough time or space. If you are in the Northern CA/SF north Bay area
and are interested p-mail me and I will give you the phone #. I know the guy
wants to sell it but it was not advertised so.... I am sure many calls are
not what is wanted. It is in fairly good shape, little rust, some body
scrapes and minor dents on the passenger side. The interior needs a little
work but is in good shape. There is a stove, fridge z bed etc. -- I think
the deluxe package. pop top is in working order but there is a fairly large
rip - not too big to patch and/or sew however.


I went by a local VW specialist mechanic today re: my engine temp. (today in
ambient temp of mid to upper 80's a high temp of 260 after climbing a big
hill) He asked the usual is it pinging ..... questions and then pulled out a
temp. gun and measured the temp on several places on the case and at my oil
pressure sender. The highest temp was 205. The bus had been siting for
awhile (he had been on the phone etc....) When I turned on the ignition the
gauge showed 180. Now I know that what was being measured by the gun was the
case and not the oil, but does this mean that the gauge is off 25
degrees?????? Any way the mechanic seemed to think that the oil temp. gauge
was more trouble than it was worth and that I should not worry. I am a
skeptic.
