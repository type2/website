Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS  help needed in Conneticut

Paul,

Let's go over this again....wife driving, bus dies.

You come and find points are bad(closed up).
You reset points. 

Bus fires right up.
Short test drive...still ok.

Get ready to leave and drive ?? miles and bus dies.

Why??? were the points closed up?  

My guess is that the fuel pump is ok and the points are bad.
Forget fuel pump until you look at the points again.

or...if you dump a little gas down the carb, will it try to start?

Stick with what you *know* was bad to start with...sounds like you
needed new points anyway...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;     I was in West Virginia this past weekend to attend a wedding and
&gt; dropped in on John Brown&quot;s Buses to spend about some time around the
&gt; campfire.  Little did I know that while I was enjoying the camaraderie
&gt; of other bus owners that my wife , Kathy, was in Conneticut having
&gt; problems with our '71 bus.  After driving 61/2 hours on Sunday, in our
&gt; Subaru, to get home I found out that the bus is at a friends house up
&gt; there in New England.  So, back in the car with my tool box and
&gt; Bentley manual and about 21/2 hours later we were there.
&gt;     I found the points closed up almost toally, and reset them.  I
&gt; also checked for fuel pump output.  While I didn't have my pressure
&gt; gauge with me, there was definetly a little pressure but the volume
&gt; seemed low.  The bus started right up, I set the timing, and the wife
&gt; went on a short test drive.  All seemed well so off we went.  We got
&gt; up on hi-way I-95 and were on the bridge going over the river there
&gt; near Bridgeport when the bus started bucking and finally stopped
&gt; running.  From my wife's description it sounded like it's running out
&gt; of gas.  Has anyone ever heard of engine temp. effecting fuel pump
&gt; operation? Well a short tow truck drive and we were back at our
&gt; friends house.
&gt;     Right now my best guess is the fuel pump is bad.  Since the bus is
&gt; 2 to 3 hours from our house, I'm looking for FLAPS or aircooled
&gt; knowelegeble shops, or other resources in the Bridgeport/Stratford,
&gt; Conneticut area.  Anybody in that area want to lend a hand?  Anyway,
&gt; any and all help is appreciated.
