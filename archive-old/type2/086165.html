Subject: RE: [T2] horn and brake lights are linked

&gt; Years ago I had a 72 bus that sounded the horn whenever I hit a bump in
&gt; the road. It was the source of much amusement for passengers, including
&gt; the beautiful lady I eventually married. I tried, but never figured it
out.


For one day, my Vanagon decided to alert everybody that I was making a right
turn, by beeping the horn just one short beep each time I turned.  Before I
even had a chance to look into it, it stopped on its own accord.
