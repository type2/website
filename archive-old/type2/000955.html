Subject: Re: Side tent bought



&gt;       It has about a 2 inch tear that she sewed up, but otherwise in
&gt; excellent shape, the colors are bright, the original bags, 28 poles
&gt; which looks to be the right amount I think? It has a photo-copy of like
&gt; a parts list, I'm missing the parts that hold it to my rain gutter,
&gt; part=231 068 151(roof bracket, up to no. 2561) also 231 068 152(roof
&gt; bracket). Does anyone have any available? Or is there another way of
&gt; attaching it to my gutter? I'd love to hear any idea's you might have


I use a couple pieces of rebar (cut to about 3 feet each for easy storage)
and a couple clamps.  I place the vestibule over the gutter, then place the
rebar over the vestibule in the gutter.  I secure it with I couple of spring
clamps.  I also use a couple of magnets to hold things in place.

I should have put all of this in the past tense -- I am still trying to
replace my tent poles that were recently stolen.
