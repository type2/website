Subject: Anyone parting out a bus?
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2000 13:06:29 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was wondering if anyone is parting out a 69-73 Bus?

I need the drivers side door lock mechanism from one of those years.
This is the part of the lock mechanism that is inside the door.
The tensioning spring on the lock side of the mechanism has broken on mine,
making it very hard to lock and unlock the door with the key.  This part was
available new from RMMW until very recently.

Thanks for your help...
