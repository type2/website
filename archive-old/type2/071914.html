&gt;Hydrocarbon's are what in the US they refer to as HC, these are the emissions
&gt;that evaporating gas gives off. Living in the sovereign state of Calif. we're
&gt;quite familiar with smog tests. Does your bus have a catalytic converter? I
&gt;just went through this with a 89 chevy, wouldn't pass until the mechanic broke
&gt;down and confided that the cat was probably at fault. Replace the cat and
&gt;passed no problem

Chuck...My '82 was made well before catalytic converters were uses in the
UK. Since my 'borderline pass' I have discovered that my timing was out by
8 degrees and that there was no air filter in the air inlet!. By fixing the
timing and sticking in an air filter hopefully this has gone some way to
reducing my HCs.

Thanks for your help
