Why?  If they're ripping us off, don't they deserve to be dragged into the
light of day?

&gt; They had ran out of Regular (87) and they told me i
&gt; could have Super (93) for the same price. At first i misunderstood the
&gt; guy and picked up the mid grade (89) and it wouldn't work. The guy told
&gt; me &quot;Oh yeah, the 89 is hooked up to the same tank as the 87&quot;.

Years ago, some stations had a &quot;dial a grade&quot; system where you could set a
knob on the pump to the grade you wanted.  since there were six or more
possible selections, they must have been mixing low and high octane to get
the intermediate values.  Perhaps this station is doing the same, which
would explain why the midgrade pump is hooked to the regular tank.
