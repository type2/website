Greetings,

Last week I posted that I had just bought a 79 Westy for $450, not
running but complete and rust free.   Thanks for all the encouraging
replies, I knew that I could count on you guys for the moral support!

 I had a flatbed deliver it last Tuesday.  I took the day off so that I could
explore my new toy.  The battery was dead so I pulled it out and put it on
the charger, not taking a charge so I bought a new one.  Installed it,
turned the key and it started right up.  Lots of valve noise (lifters pumping
up) that went away after several minutes.  I could not believe how
smoothly it ran.  I drove it to the Amoco at the end of the block and filled it
up with premium and injector cleaner.  Parked it back in the garage and
sat in it for a couple of hours &quot;soaking up the Karma&quot;.  The VW Gods
were definitely smiling on me!!

I've spent the last week going over things to see what needs replacing or
fixing (and searching the archives, it's amazing how relevant this info is
when you actually own a bus).  Here's what I've found:

Engine:  
120-125 compression on all 4
missing engine seal and 2 sparkplug seals
missing the cooling tin under the cylinders
generally pretty dirty
recently replaced CV joints

Body:
some rust around windshield and left side jelousy window
nasty scratch from middle of sliding door to rear quarter panel
misc rock chips
front end has been pushed in, doesn't look bad with tire on front
rear bumper pretty banged up

Interior:
this is the deluxe camper, including a BA6 (not working) with A/C
(working)
12V fridge, missing the refrigeration unit, cooler still there
no child cot
missing the curtain for the front 
front seats recovered in non-westy material (other upholstery in very
nice condition)
poptop seal excellent, canvas not so good
sink pump not working
stove works great

I've replaced the spark plugs and wires (new seals) and have made my
own engine seal with foam pipe insulation until I get a new one ordered. 
I've put about 75 miles on it and it really is running smooth and quiet.  Now
for the questions :)

Does anyone have the 12V refridgaration unit?  I am also unable to find a
wiring diagram for the westy stuff (sink, fridge, voltage converter,
battery tester, auxillary battery, etc..).

When I open the cabinet to the right of the stove that is meant for the
spare tire, I found an orange and white striped tent that is in excellent
condition.  No poles.  I searched for info on this but have come up empty,
anyone know where I can get poles or do I have to make them myself?

This week/weekend I will be doing fuel lines, brakes, front wheel
bearings, and cleaning up the engine compartment.  The auxillary battery
is probably dead so I might replace that and try to figure out the wiring. 
Any tips?

I can't tell you all how exited I am about this bus!! I've spent hours just
sitting in it and fussing with little stuff, what a blast!

TIA
