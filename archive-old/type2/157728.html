&gt; Mike,

&gt; Since a valve adjustment is one of the first things I have to do to my
&gt; new Bus, I'm curious -- are we talking about a thin layer applied to the
&gt;  head side of the gasket, as well as the layer applied to the valve
&gt; cover side?
&gt;
&gt; I always thought the head side wasn't supposed to have sealant.

You are correct!  Don't put sealer on the head side of the gasket.

The cover side is a matter of debate.  I prefer not to use hardening
sealant on the covers, so I use Hylomar, which is hard to find these days
but can be purchased on the Internet or at savvy Harley dealers.  Makes
swapping gaskets a wipe-and-go operation.
