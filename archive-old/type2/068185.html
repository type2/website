Subject: Idle Stabilizer, '81 Vanagon

Does anyone know the part number for this item?  Mine has disappeared
and I'm going to try and get lucky at the junk yards.

Can anyone explain to me what this part does, and how it does it?  Also,
what happens if it's defective (or gone!)?  (I have 3 manuals covering
the Vanagon; they all tell me how to test the idle stablilizer, but not
_one_ of them tells me what it does!).

Thanks
