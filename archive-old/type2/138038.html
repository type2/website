&gt;Hope this wasn't covered in the recent lengthy dipstick exchanges.  I had to 
&gt;modify the tube set-up on my '79 bus.  Accordingly, the marks on the 
&gt;dipstick no longer represent the true oil level.  Does anyone have a 
&gt;measurement from the top of the dipstick tube to the bottom of the crankcase 
&gt;(In other words, the length of a rod pushed down into the dipstick tube 
&gt;until it bottomed out).  If I had this measurement I could make the 
&gt;appropriate corrections.

Please explain your modifications?

The dipstick normally would bottom out but there is a bump on the plate underneath it to allow it to clear:

The length you are looking for is basically the length of the dipstick.

The original marks are at these locations:
