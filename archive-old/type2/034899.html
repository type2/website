Subject: Re: Pre 72 motor in 72-79 chassis?

Hi John,

&gt; Is it possible to install an early (pre '72) 1600 upright motor into a
&gt; later (72-79) chassis? I realize that some modifications and fabrication
&gt; would be needed if it will bolt-up.

Of course it'll fit. I have a 1978 with a 1600. In Europe that was the
standard bus (even on early vanagons!), the US busses however all had a
type 4 engine after 1972. But it won't fit right without some items that
are not common in the US:

- A 72-79 engine support beam (the 68-71 type won't fit and the type 4
beam is different judging from my Vw parts book)
- The right engine sheet metal (the 72-79 engine compartment has a
different shape)

- Perhaps you'll also need a 68/71 gearbox and/or a different starter
motor, it might not fit on the flywheel, just try these items before
installing I guess.
- I have no idea about exhaust emission control items on thse engines.
Perhaps you should check the late 70ties US-beetles with 1600 engine for
that.



Good luck!


Vincent
