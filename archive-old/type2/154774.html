&gt; The first odditiy is that the turn signal circuit matches no diagram on vintagebus.  The relay (PN 211 953
215 C) has four spade connectors, not the nine I was expecting.  There also appears to be an internal
malfunction in that box, as the dash indicators will flash a time or two then fade. I am betting when I open
the box, I'll find a dead capacitor. Does anyone  (KARL????) have an ID on that part # or better as circuit
diagram?  I have not removed or opened it yet, as I am working on the parking lights first.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nine pin box, part number 211 953 227B [says 211 953 227 on it] was used on 1968 models up to vin 2x8 098
285.

Your 211 953 215C was used from vin 2x8 098 286 to the end of the 1970 model year.

Look at the 1970 wiring diagrams on vintagebus_dot_com. #1 on either non USA or USA. J2 is the 4 pin relay.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; The parking lights... I have power into the switch and power to the headlights but no power out on the wire
to the parking light switch.  I have not scrounged thru my stash, but again.... how universal are headlight
switches?  Other than cosmetics, did the contact set change much?  I'll open this one up and get into contact
polishing, but I'd like to know if one of my late bay switches will substitute if I screw up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

68 to the end of 70, the headlight switch is part number 311 941 531A.

E1 in the same 1970 wiring diagram.  Most all later switches do not have terminal 57.  Term 57 lights up the
green indicator on the dash when the parking lights are on.
