Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line size


From: &quot;Bill Monk&quot; &lt;wmonk_at_snet_dot_net&gt;

&gt; I have been trying to find a piece of fuel line for my 78 bus. It's the
&gt; line between the pump and the filter. I think it's 10mm but I am not
&gt; sure. I called the local VW dealer and they don't know the size or have
&gt; it.(usual thing they always say to me). Could someone tell me
&gt; what size this is? I tried going to all local stores with the filter and
&gt; no one had anything that fit.  I want to call some shops further away
&gt; and see if they have it. Thanks.

Sorry I did not read this one and reply last night.
Yes, it is 10mm. About 3&quot; long.
[before the filter and after the pump, it is 7.5mm]
Go to your local Mercedes dealership parts dept. and ask for
part number 112 476 12 26. Maybe they will give you a short piece.....since a
meter of it lists for $15.50 and you don't need all that much [39 1/4&quot;]
