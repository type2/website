Subject: Re: [T2] missing

volks

   just want some imput,  last fri my 78 2L FI started having an
occasional miss.   very sporatic.   Sat I had to drive about 150 miles and
in the begining it ran fine, but the longer I drove the more often it
would miss, this is the cyl not fire kind of miss, thought it might be
fuel filter, but changed it about 3 months ago..????  on the way back was
running almost entirely on 3 cyl.

  snowed and rained yesterday, today very little bit better.  went out and
determined it was #2 cyl not firing.  switched injector wires with #1
still #2 missing so not power to injectors.  good spark to the plug.  so
I'm down to thinking .bad plug(fairly new Boschs) . bad injector
. valves  
now with valves I would not expect the intermittent nor the total lack of
noise.  also it will occasionally fire a few times, then stop again.

am cold and wet came in. supposed to be better day tommorrow and wed.  I'm
off tommorrow anyway so my plan of attack I guess

.  compression test
.  examine plug while it is out.
.  swap in another injector.
.  ???

  suggestions, comments,?
