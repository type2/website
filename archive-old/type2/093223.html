Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?


&gt;&gt;An engine without flaps will never warm up and will ruin itself before 
&gt;&gt;it's due time - dies an early death.
&gt;==========================&gt;
&gt;Well, I'm not so sure about this position.
&gt;I have two 1970 buses; both with original block engines and original heat 
&gt;exchangers.
&gt;
&gt;Casper has no thermostat and no flaps, warms up nicely, and actually puts 
&gt;out more heat to the cab than NewBus. (more on this later = **)
&gt;Casper has been run in sub-zero temps and combined extremes of high 
&gt;altitude, wet, cold, low barometer.
&gt;He warms up fine, runs fine, and seems to have no complications at all 
&gt;from running without flaps or thermostat.
&gt;He has survived well in temps as high as 120 F with the road surface temps 
&gt;being above that, I would presume.

My non-flapped Type IV engine had oil temps, oil pressure, cylinder head 
temp gauges.

It did not run hot but the temps did go up and down based on engine speed 
and ambient temps and the load on the engine, etc.

I can't help but worry about all of that. Or course the 911 engines did not 
come with flaps. Would be nice to know for sure.
