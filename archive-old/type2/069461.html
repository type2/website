.  Otherwise get the
&gt; sledgehammer wheel nut removal tool available from RMMW and VW shops. 

FWIW i have heard (from Anthony Gelato FWIW) that these &quot;tools&quot; while popular and convenient are 
not able to torque the nut on sufficiently. You might want to consider getting a*long* (i.e. 6 foot) cheater 
bar and a 3/4&quot; drive. The 3/4&quot;  and the 46mm socket will prolly be the more expensive route though.

my $0.02
