Subject: [T2] Air cleaner support removal

Hi Volks,
If there is anyone out there in Bus land that has ever removed the air
cleaner support bracket without tearing it or the bus up to much.  Mine
seems to be welded at the base and spot welds on the back but no amount of
drilling or cutting seems to do much gold- the damm thing won't budge. Any
and all advice will be greatly appreciated. As always, TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
