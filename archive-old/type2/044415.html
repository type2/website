Subject: Re: [T2] 79 gas tank removal and 67 Westy for sale

&gt;Is there any way to remove the gas tank in a 79 bus without having to pull
&gt;the engine?


Yes I have done this - we are talking about the type 4 engine aren't we?

Getting the panel off for access to the tank is quite easy. I don't know
what you have to remove with FI but getting the carbs off is pretty simple.
If that's all you want then you can be in in about 30 minutes.

To actually remove the tank you'll have to get at the straps which hold it
in place. This was the hardest bit as the nuts are underneath and the heater
flaps are in the way. Get a long nose 13 mm socket.

You'll need to remove a few other items in the engine compartment to pull
the tank right out but it took me about 3 hours in and out if I remember
rightly
