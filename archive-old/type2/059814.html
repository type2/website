Subject: Type IV manifold tube gaskets

When installing manifold tubes, do gaskets go on either side of the fibre 
spacer? St. Muir says only between spacer and tube, not between spacer 
and head. That seems wierd. Bentley and Haynes just say: &quot;Use new 
gaskets.&quot; Thanks alot.

Also: to Permatex or not?

TIA
