Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump connection

Edward

There is 2 connections that point upwards,, they are larger,[inlet]  and
smaller,[to carbs], the other one that is much smaller, points to the bottom, is
a vent,,and originally it had a hose on it that went into the tin that the
intake breather draws air from,,,, but most I have seen just leave the 4&quot; hose
hanging down towards the ground.

Hope that helps

&gt; Easy question for someone...
&gt; 
&gt; Hooking back up my engine and have an extra connection on my fuel pump, '72 stock
&gt; mechanical pump.  One connection to the fuel tank, the other to the carb, but I can't figure
&gt; out where the bottom connection goes to..
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
