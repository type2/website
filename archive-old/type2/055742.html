Subject: Re: Weekender rear seat

Robert: About a year ago, I paid about $90.00 for a Weekender frame
and the two foam pads that go onto it, which I installed in my '82
Vanagon. For some reason there was no upholstery on this rig so I assume
the price was a little lower than it might have been otherwise (but it
didn't matter to me).  The trick, it seemed to me, was finding one at
all -- although I never prowled the junkyards; in fact, I bought it from
a listmember.  (I have the impression the Weekender platform is slightly
wider than the Westie fold-down rear seat (because, I think, the Westie
has a storage cabinet abutting the sleeping area).  Whatever, the
Weekender setup has worked very well for us, and I consider the $90.00
well spent. Cheers, Art

&gt; What is a fair price for a used rear seat from a weekender package assuming
&gt; the seat is in good condition. I'm looking to buy and was asked how much I
&gt; wanted to pay. I had no idea what is fair.
