&gt;The reason cars run less efficiently in cold weather is because gasoline
&gt;doesn't vaporize as well.

Sounds right to me, and reminds me of the way fuel lines are coiled in
backpacking stoves to prewarm the fuel on its' way to the ring where
combustion happens (I'm browning out on the name of it, at the base of the
flame).  I assume that's why VW ran the heat riser along the intake
manifold.

Anybody got a safe method for warming the fuel just prior to the fuel pump?
I'll bet the truck manufacturers have this one figured out.
