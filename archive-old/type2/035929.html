Subject: Unfreezing rear wheels
Content-Disposition: inline

Hey list,
I'm attempting to remove a bus from CO's garage. It was backed in so the rear wheels are in the back of the garage,
and the emergency brake was firmly and completely applied even though it's sitting on level ground, back in 1991. So
it's got 9 years with the e-brake locking the shoes to the drums. Needless to say, when I put it in neutral and try to
push
it out, it laughs at me really loud. CO is eccentric and won't let me work on it there. Flatbed truck could get back
there
and hook it and pull it, but questions:
1) would pulling it out with a winch unfreeze the wheels or would it just skid onto the flatbed?
2) assuming I make it to my house, what are my prospects for loosening the wheels up? Will 5 cans of wd-40 and a
good drum puller do the job?   Any experience out there?
