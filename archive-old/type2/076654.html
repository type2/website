&gt; Bob:
&gt; Actually, the VW factory made some light duty heater boxes and put them on
411's. (Possibly 412's too, but I've never dissected one.) These were
&gt; the same fittings as the 72-74 type 2's, only they just don't have the
aluminum radiators inside. Quite a bit smaller on the outside, too.
&gt; Apparently all 411's had Eberspaecher auxiliary heaters, so didn't rely
too much on the engine heat. I saw some NOS ones on *bay a while back, but
&gt; around here we need heat!

We happen to have a pair of NOS 411 / 412 heater boxes on our blowout page
right now.  $125.00 each
