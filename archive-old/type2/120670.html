&gt; I changed the oil I considered dumping in a bottle of &quot;Oil Detergent&quot;
&gt; that is supposed to remove build-up and sludge, freeing stuck valves and

&gt; these kinds of products.  Can damage result from using this kind of
&gt; internal engine cleaner on a 20+ year old motor?  I don't want to cause
&gt; more harm than good.

Mr. Cupples,

If what you truly have is a collapsed lifter then you have a decision to
make.  You can buy a can of oil cleaner or you can buy a new lifter.

Most oils these days contain complete detergent packages and I do not
believe that aftermarket additions will help.  I also do not believe that
any will hurt anything other than your wallet.

A new lifter
(http://www.busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/view.jsp?model=42&amp;category=15&amp;group=12&amp;prodgroup=124)
costs $14.95 and can be installed in less than an hour.

One further word of advice.  Be sure to check compression on any hydraulic
lifter engine after adjustment.  Especially if you have a collapsed lifter
there is a danger that you have over-tightened it and propped a valve
open.

                             OOK!
