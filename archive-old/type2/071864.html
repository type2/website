Subject: full width Westy seat/bed
Message-ID: &lt;fc5e2def.24b5f830_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello Listees,

I'm looking for a full width rear seat/bed for a 68-79 westy.  This was an 
option, I believe, but I have only seen one in my life.  If anyone has one 
that they want to sell and it's close enough for me to go and get it 
(shipping would be horrendous, I think), please p-mail me.  I live in NE 
Oklahoma.

I have a set of the folding brackets and can use the narrower seat as a 
pattern, but I have so many things to do to Hannah, my '72 non-Westy camper 
to get her ready for BBA,  that I would rather not have to build a seat/bed 
right now.
