Subject: Air cleaner sucking oil thru crankcase breather

Hello volksters.  My '72 with aftermarket single carb and air filter 
is sucking oil into the air filter element (and probably passing it 
into the combustion process).

See photo http://www.pauldottrip_dot_com/vw_bus/breatherHose.jpg

Does anyone have a better suggestion on how to breathe the crankcase 
with this type of carb/air cleaner setup?

------------

Also oil seems to be pushing out of the oil filler tube where the 
metal joins with the plastic.  I think it is due to combustion &quot;blow 
by&quot;.  I was thinking of making a hole in the oil filler cap and 
adding this kind of a &quot;breather&quot; hose.  What do you think of this?
