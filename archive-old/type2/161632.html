Subject: Re: [T2] 4 15&quot; rims for $100

George, I FINALLY tried the rims on the '78 and they do not fit.  No way!!  
I pulled the ad off the Samba...  Whew .  .  Red face and all.

The offset is 22/92 ET44 as marked on the rim, but the center hole is 
tooooooo small to fit over the front hub and there is some raized surfaces 
around the back of the rim that will not let them fit the rear.  The lug 
bolts are about 1/2 inch too short.

I guess I will advertize them on the acution site in pairs for VW Eurovan 
SNOW TIRE rins...

Thanks for talking to me...

BTW, I am off to the yards this morning to check for a front right door for 
my '78.  Ray Nemo is talking with me (thanks Ray, for being there) if the 
sources my Virginia/Md/DC area have dried up.

Is the offset correct for a vanagon or bay?  The Eurovan is FWD and I
don't recall seeing eurovan wheels on an earlier bus.
