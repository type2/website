&gt; did the trim change over the years? on my 70, which i just installed a
&gt; new seal for (long one, not the short middle one) it has metal clips
&gt; inside it which merely pinch the edge of the fiberglass top (or so i was
&gt; told AFTER i glued the damn thing on!!). now the smaller middle one i
&gt; installed with 3M weather strip adhesive as i was advised to use.
&gt; actually, the instructions that came with mine suggested 3M.

The newer seals have an embedded clip.  The original seal, at least for the
years I'm familiar with have an exposed steel slip which rusts and causes
the seal to fall off prematurely.
