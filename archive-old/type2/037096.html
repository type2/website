Check out &quot;California Campers&quot; on the Vanagon_dot_com website. He has Westfalia
Campers for rent, and Sorin will probably make you a reasonable (not cheap)
deal. Mention you got his name from the list...

Subject: Would like to borrow/rent camper in California


Listers,

I am attending an academic conference in Los Angeles next week. After the
conference (March, 19-24) I would like to see some of California's national
parks. Since my own campers are on the East Coast and in Germany
respectively, I would like to borrow or rent one in California. I could
offer the use of my campers in return.

I am a fairly experienced VW owner (both type 1 and type 4 engines, I
had/have: '65 sundial, '70 super beetle, '74 Westy deluxe, '78 European
1600dp, '79 Westy deluxe, '82 crew cab, '84 Vanagon). My campers are located
in Takoma Park, MD (just outside DC) and Hameln, Germany (around Hannover).

Cheers,
Marcus
