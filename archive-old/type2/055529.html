Subject: Re: Rebuilding vacuum distributor

WHen I got a vac adv distributor (from Ken Hooper) the shaft was really
loose and it was filthy, but that was ok cause it only cost me 7 or
eight bucks.  I knew that before I could run it, it would need a rebuild
or something. After talking to my VWFLAPS and following a few
references, I found some place called United Industries (in Albany,
OR)-I guess it was a machine shop, but they did alot more.  I was able
to trade it in for a re-manufactured unit with matching #'s.  Basically
a brand new vacuum adv distribtor. The body was all clean and shiny, no
dirt, and the shaft was very tight.  

When ever I need distriubutor work done in the future, this is where
I'll go.  Qaulity stuff.
