Subject: RE: [T2] convert hydraulic to solid

Ohh oohh I can answer this one.

Will yeah the pushrods for hydraulic and solid lifters are different. Easy
way to tell, use a magnet to the middle of the tube. If the magnet sticks,
it's a hydraulic rod. The solid lifter rods were aluminum in the middle
sections with steel tips.

That right? Or do I have it the wrong way around? I think that's right.
