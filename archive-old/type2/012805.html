From: Dan &lt;vw_bus_74_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
Subject: new (to me) noise
In-Reply-To: &lt;200104021533.IAA86038_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

On my stock 74 (pertronix added) I have this erratic
snapping sound on acceleration... not like a noisy lifter
clattering. More of a sharp sounding snapping. Not real
loud.
I can only hear it when anothe car is next to me or when I
am driving past something that reflects the noise back at
me.
I have:
Replaced the cap an rotor.
Adjusted the valves (twice).
Checked plug wires.
Worried.
  The bus starts, as always, right up. I have no
noticable change in power.  Coil is good.. I stuck my spare
in to see if it would have an effect... it didnt.
Havent pulled the plugs but thats my next planned step.
could it be...
bad/broken spring (valve)?
exhaust leak?
   Any theory is welcome.... Thanks!

Regular naps prevent old age.....
especially if you take them while driving.
