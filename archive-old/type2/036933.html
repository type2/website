Subject: Push Rods

I'm planning on getting back into bus ownership after a 23 year abscence! 
Unfortunately I'm didn't learn anything back then other than how to have fun 
in them so I'm on a pretty steep learning curve here. This site is really THE 
thing that made me decide to quit saying I would eventually get another bus, 
and to go do it. I forsee the list being extremely helpful. Question.. I'm 
going on a trip next week to look at one that seems promising. It's a '79 
automatic bus that's been converted to a camper. The owner says that the only 
repair it needs are new push rods, and depending on my offer, he will have 
that done for me. Roughly what should a repair like that cost being done at a 
garage?
