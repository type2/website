&gt;Me wonders what condition the &quot;dime-sized zoobee&quot; would be in when applied
&gt;to even the most conservative summer driving in Phoenix or other SW USA
&gt;desert spots. At what temperature does the dime thing melt the center?

&gt;Lisa Q. said:
&gt;Larry (at GEX) put a small disk, about the size of a dime on the engine for
&gt;abuse detection... If the engine is overheated, the center of the disk
&gt;melts. This shows weather the engine has been mistreated or not.
&gt;
Nope, I didn't say GEX put the disk on. I said that AVP (where my
rebuilt came from) put it on, and wondered why GEX doesn't do this.
