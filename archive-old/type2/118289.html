Subject: Yeah! I found it! was Re: ...still won't idle cold

After Gumouting the aux air valve with no improvement and checking all
the hoses I was at a loss.

I found my volt/ohm meter and checked things today....

aux air valve was in spec.
AFM was in spec.

only other thing I could check was temperature sensor...

spec is 2500 ohms at 20 degrees C.

It was around there today....about 68 F

On checking it I found its resistance was 1150 ohms....way off....even
if the temperature isn't exactly right it was way off.

To test further I left the temperature sensor disconnected and started
the engine.  Started and idled okay with rpms slowly rising....I left
it go a while and shut it off.

With the sensor disconnected the resistance was infinite so that was
the other side of the spec.  I guess the computer figured it needed
more fuel with more resistance...in any case, it seems to be the temp.
sensor.

&gt;&gt; Wil,
&gt;&gt; I agree that the auxiliary air valve and most notably its air
&gt;&gt; supply hose is the number one suspect. If there is any leak that
&gt;&gt; allows tramp air between the outlet of the AFM and the auxiliary
&gt;&gt; air valve input, then when the air valve is doing its job (allowing
&gt;&gt; additional air input to the manifold) it is doing so in a manner
&gt;&gt; that this additional air is not properly sensed by the AFM, so the
&gt;&gt; control unit doesn't compensate with additional gas, and the
&gt;&gt; mixture that gets to the combustion chamber is too lean; therefore
&gt;&gt; no idle. So check both ends of the hose that supplies the air
&gt;&gt; valve, and the hose itself for a crack.
