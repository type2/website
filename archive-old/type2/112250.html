Passing this along from an email ad I was sent:
 
&gt; Over the last two months, we have been running a few different website special 
&gt; offers. We wanted  to find out which type of offer was favored by our 
&gt; customers. And you have spoken loud and clear.........FREE SHIPPING....... is 
&gt; what the people want, so that is what we are going to give you. Until further 
&gt; notice on orders of $50 or more, the shipping is FREE. Any order over $50 
&gt; shipped to the lower 48 States and Canada. Oversize and over weight items may 
&gt; have additional charges apply
