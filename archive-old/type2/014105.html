Subject: more comments on oil pressure sender, etc.

are you guys tired of hearing from me yet?  jeez, do i ever shutup?

really i just wanted to add more comments.  some of the people who
replied asked if the motor was running hot.

the answer AFAIK is NO.  i frequently do the dipstick test.  probably too
much.  maybe i'm just a paranoid freak. or maybe just a freak period.
the dipstick is always a little warm, but never even close to being hot.

i dont have any guages - &quot;if its good enough for Muir, its good enough
for me&quot;

thanks again everyone. i dont know what i'd do without this list.
