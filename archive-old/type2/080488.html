I think that Britt means Rich Kimbrough as he makes a heck of a stout tow
bar.  He can be contacted at richard.g.kimbrough_at_intel_dot_com

Thanks list -

I found that Jerry Jess has one that he's willing to part with, assuming the
lendee gives it back to him. Also who/where's Richard Kimball?

P.S. I swear I'll get the Bus Names page updated this W/E. I have over a
dozen folks who emailed.

&gt;Mike,
&gt;I just towed my 71 Westy from Az. to Calif on all 4 wheels. Yes you do run
&gt;the risk of burning up the engine or tranny if the Bus is left in gear. I
&gt;did a simple check to make sure I didn't leave mine in gear. I would lift
&gt;the engine cover and have my son pull the bus a few feet forward and watch
&gt;the pulley on the generator to see if it moved. If it did move the bus was
&gt;still in gear and I'd take it out of gear and repeat the process. I have
&gt;towed bugs and busses all over hell and back and never had a problem.
&gt;   Richard Kimball makes a very stout Bus tow bar that will work on your 69
&gt;bus. It hooks up just like a Bug tow bar around the front beam.
