Subject: SoftScrub &amp; the Westy interior

Just spent three hours today inspecting the Sierra
Yellow 72 Westy I bought on the 'net. 
For me, the fun part of getting a bus home is going
through the interior, checking out the nooks and
crannies, pulling out  the stuff from the PO (a gas
receipt here, an errant wire hangar there) and
cleaning the stuff off.

For me this one was especially  cool, because my dad
owned a Sierra yellow 72 Westy, we went camping all up
and down the West coast in it. 

Today, I sat in the back, cleaning off every inch of
the interior. Upholstery, walls, cabinets, windows,
etc.

There was a sort of film on the yellow painted
surfaces around the windows. I took damp paper towels
and put two squirts of watered-down Simple Green on
them and a tiny bit of Soft Scrub. The grime came
right off with very little elbow grease (too much
rubbing might hurt the paint)
I can't endorse this Softscrub enough.
I also used damp paper towels with some SoftScrub to
clean the white trim on the cabinets, sink table, and
the table tops.
The stuff works like magic. The trims look like new!
(Don't rub too hard, and wipe with damp cloth
afterward.)

So, the good news is, the interior is amazing. Tables,
upholstery with only a rip in the corner of the jump
seat. Even the shock cord for the curtains, the
screens,  hinges on the sinktop table are great. The
icebox even has the rack and drip tray. It was like
going down memory lane remembering everything we used
to have in the family bus (fond memories of sleeping
in the child's cot above the front seats)

Well, I'm getting carried away: Soft Scrub on the
white tabletops and white trims on the cabinets and
cabinet doors.
That's it.

Thanks for listening
Jason
