Subject: Front door reassemble sequence?

Greetings list,

Well I'm busy putting back together my 78 Westy after last summers paint 
job. So far I have the doors and seals on and almost all the glass in 
(windshield a joy). Next is the pop top paint project. Its amazing how easy 
the slider door closes when it is clean/lubed and the worn nylon block is 
replaced. Really easy to do.  I can't believe how many buses I've had that 
the slider was hard to close. Can't believe I lived with it for so long. I'd 
encourage everybody to give that rear hinge/support some love.

Anyway, for a question.

Its been a year since I took apart the front doors. I have another bus that 
I am currently driving to look at to see what goes where. That's the easy 
part. I managed to reassemble the drivers side door today. Turned out decent 
but added some words to my vocabulary. I'd rather do CV joints or grind my 
own face into a brick wall than these doors. In an effort to have the pass. 
side go better what's the sequence? I'm not talking door 
handles/locks/latches/armrests/panels just the glass and seals. This is for 
a '78 Westy.

for installation is it?

1. install window roller mechanism (that the window crank attaches to), big 
&quot;U&quot; shaped.
2. Install outer scraper and &quot;chrome&quot;
3. place large window insde door
4. install vent/wing widow assembly (glass, frame, seals, felt channel)
5. install inside scraper
6. install &quot;L&quot; shaper felt channel
7. bolt large window to window roller mechanism

Or is it some other order?

Thanks,
Brandt Hart
