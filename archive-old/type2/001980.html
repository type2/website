The difference is that a bus really does not have a separate chassis in the
sense that a bug does; it's basically a unibody construction, making a
&quot;chassis swap&quot; far more difficult if not impossible.  On a bug, you can
literally just lift the body off of the chassis.  Can't do that on a bus.

&gt; I have seen some pics of the Brazillian Type II bus. It has an elevated
&gt; roofline giving extra headroom. I also saw that BTLMEX is getting new VW
&gt; Beetles into the USA by doing chassis swaps and thought I would
&gt; ask if they could do a similar service for the Brazilian busses.
