Subject: RE: [T2] Need help estimating value of 78 champagne

I have State Farm here in Va and I have collision on my bus. I just happened
to be at their office getting insurance for my new PT Cruiser :) What a fun
little ride.

Anyway, I checked on the bus to verify that collision was on it. I asked no
more questions. It is definitely not pretty, faded paint and a few dents, so
that should not matter. Of course the value they give me if the bus is
totaled will not be great because of the paint job.

How are people insuring their busses based on these value guides?  State
Farm won't offer me collision because my bus rates a really low value grade
in their system.  Do I have to get it re-painted before they will insure me?
Sheesh.
