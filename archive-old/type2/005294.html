Hi all,
Earlier this week I posted a response to Barry's question about setting
dwell in which I stated that a VW distributor is driven off the camshaft.  I
don't know what kind of crack I was smoking, but that is NOT the case.  In
the VW engine, the distributor is driven off the crankshaft, which is why it
spins clockwise like the engine.

I also made reference to a Volvo I purchased from Barry in which the
distributor turns counterclockwise while the engine rotates clockwise.
That's because the Volvo distributor is driven from the camshaft, which,
being gear-driven from the crankshaft (like VW), rotates in the opposite
direction of the crankshaft.

What disappoints me most is that NO ONE called me on this, which means
either no one reads my posts or no one knows any better.  Knowing the
expertise on this list, I'm sure it's the former ;-)

Sorry for any confusion
