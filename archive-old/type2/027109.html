Hi Everybody,
   In an earlier post, someone said;
      &quot;... I purchased an electrical fuel pump and have installed it, and am 
ready to power it up.  HOWEVER, I want to do it so that it will shut off if 
the engine stops running...&quot;

   Well, the only way I can think of that this might work is to provide 
power to the coil of the relay from 2 different places.  The first would be 
from the terminal on the solenoid that gets power when the key is turned to 
the start position.  The second would be from the  output of the 
generator/alternator.  In theory the way this would work is that when you 
turn the key to start the bus the relay gets energized, closing the contacts 
and causing the fuel pump to run.  Then once the engine is running and you 
let go of the key the generator provides the power to keep the relay closed. 
  That way if the engine should stop running due to an accident the 
generator would stop with it and let the relay open, which would cause the 
fuel pump to loose electrical power.  I believe the wiring to both of these 
sources would have to have a diode in line to prevent feedback.  The thing 
I'm not sure of is what happens during that brief moment when you let go of 
the key but the generator/alternator isn't up to full voltage yet.
   Just my 2 cents,
