&gt; I figured the conundrum out.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can points just go bad? I could not get my dwell set
&gt; at 50degrees
&gt; although the points looked fine. I swapped in
&gt; another new set of points
&gt; and gapped them to .016. Turn the key and the bus
&gt; starts. 

Way back when, I was taught to always wipe the
contacts of new points with acetone or use contact
cleaner, as they have a coating from the factory.
Forgot that years ago, but every now and again I have
been reminded with new points not working. It is alson
crucial to clean the area underneath the points
assembly so that it makes good electrical contact.
Glad you found the problem / hope that was really it! -BaH
