Subject: Re: [T2] 72-83 bus Thermostat

Has anyone looked at thermostats for other applicationsB to see if the 
could be modified for aircooled applications?  The priciples are the same, 
move some thing when the desired temp is reached.

&gt; &gt; For anyone looking for thermostats for the Type-4. Looks like BusDepot has
&gt; &gt; them back in stock. Someone just recently was looking for one if memory serves
&gt; &gt; me right. $49.95
&gt; 
&gt; The aircooled_dot_net article says the Type I unit opens at 80-85. I discovered
&gt; that the Type 4 thermostat opens at 85-90C which explains why John says
&gt; you'll have more heat if you do the mod.
