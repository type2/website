Subject: Florida bus - must sell

I've got to get rid of my 1972 vw bus.

The body is in decent shape, but it stopped working about a month or two 
ago and I'm unable to give it the attention it needs.  It has a couple 
electrical problems that need to be addressed before it will be up and 
running, but nothing too expensive.  I originally purchased the bus for 
$1800, but I'm asking $700 for it.  I recently put in a new exhaust (which 
is even now starting to show sign of rust, unfortunately) and I also have 
new spark plugs, new spark plug wires, new oil filter, and probably a few 
other odds and ends here and there.  It has two bench seats and an A/C 
unit.  I never bothered hooking up the A/C because the guy told when I 
bought it that the compressor needed a small patch or something and I 
didn't know enough about A/C systems to try to fix it myself.

Anyhow, if you're interested in it, contact me via e-mail.  I can take some 
pictures of it if you'd like, but I'm only interested in local buyers, please.
