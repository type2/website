Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Drones and Disposable engines

A Friend, Joe Burch at Corvair Corner had a Helicopter develeped as a
disposablr by Bell Helicopter with a Corvair Engine in it. We hovered it
on the training wheels in Texas Stadium parking lot a few times but we
were all afraid to cut it loose from the training wheels. &quot;What goes up
must come down&quot;.

&gt; Harking back to the thread on type4 engines in
&gt; military drones.
&gt; About 10 years ago, i went to a military tech
&gt; conference. They has several drone models. The U.S.
&gt; Nave and Army had sophisticated ones and the Israelis
&gt; had a cruder model that had been extensively tested in
&gt; combat conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; They all had small lawn mower-sized engines, built by
&gt; U.S. companies. A developer of one of the U.S. models
&gt; said one of the things they were trying to perfect was
&gt; a cheap, light engine that would perform well--but
&gt; wear out in a few hours. The reason: some of the
&gt; drones were meant to be throw-aways, because they
&gt; would follow enemy surface-to-air missile radar down
&gt; and destroy it--kamakazi. Even the survaillence drones
&gt; weren't expected to have a long life expectancy even
&gt; if they did make it back to base a couple times. Most
&gt; of the data the drones collected would be transmitted
&gt; back in &quot;real time.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, a cheap, one-year disposable engine (like
&gt; contact lenses and Kleenex) is an interesting concept
&gt; for buses. Some of you folks seem to pull yours at
&gt; least that often. ;-)
