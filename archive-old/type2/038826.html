&gt; &gt; Question #2
&gt; &gt;      When it rains, I get water on the floor under the dash.
&gt; &gt; Is my windshield seal or the front air vents  leaking?
&gt; 
&gt; Almost certainly the windshield.  Many later T2s have this problem,
&gt; usually due to a bad seal and/or rust around the bottom of the
&gt; windshield.

--&gt; Very true.  Before you go ripping out the windshield, though, you may
want to check and make sure neither of the front turn signals is loose.
The housings go right through to the inside of the bus, and I had a leak
once that was caused by a loose one.  Didn't figure it out until I took
off the turn signal lenses one day.

Having someone hose down the front of the van while you peer under the
dash with a flashlight is often helpful in pinpointing leaks.
