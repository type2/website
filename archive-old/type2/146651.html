Subject: compression ratio vs compression?

First some definitions as I understand them:

1. compression ratio is determined by measuring cylinder bore, deck 
height, etc and applying a formula. It is expressed as a ratio of 2 numbers.

2. compression is measured with a compression gauge and is expressed in psi.

Now, many sources indicate that higher compression ratios can be a 
contributor to higher engine temps. Determining compression ratio, I 
believe, requires the engine to be removed and disassembled in order to 
make the required measurements. However compression can be measured 
without having to remove the engine. Normally compression is measured in 
all cylinders so that they can be compared in order to locate a bad 
cylinder.

Here's the question. Since compression measurements are much easier to 
obtain, is there any way to use these as indicators of a compression 
ratio that is too high? i.e. if a given compression ratio (7:1 or 
whatever) can be considered optimal, is there a certain compression (in 
psi) that can also be considered optimal (and larger values might be 
considered too high)? If so, what would this number be?

Sincere thanks,
