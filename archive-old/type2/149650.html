Subject: HCBF:  bus people in Iraq

This year at High Country Bus Festival we are going to have several giant 
greeting cards for all of us to sign so that we can send it to our fellow 
BUS PEOPLE who are in Iraq.

We currently have two Full Moon members who are currently over there:  
Snoopy and Kevin.  One other moonie Robert,  is almost finished with his 
tour and will be comming home soon!

If you know of ANY other Bus People who are over there,  please let me know, 
  get me their contact info - so that we can add them to the list.

We are also going to be gathering some &quot;care-package&quot; items to send to them.

They have both asked we NOT send items such as toothpaste, deoderant and 
stuff like that.  Also due to VERY strict local customs and rules, we cannot 
send alcohol or porn!

What would they like for us to send them:   DVD&quot;s,  pictures of us and 
buses,  bus toys,  books, and phone cards.

Anyhow,  I will have the cards available to sign at this years' High Country 
Bus Festival.  There will be some boxes set up to drop off donations.  We 
will be sending the cards and care packages  after the festival.

If you know of any other bus people who are in Iraq - please let me know.

pmail me off list with any questions!
thanks,
buddah
