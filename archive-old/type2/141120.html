Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Dave,

I would appreciate instructions on both the York and rotary compressor. Need
all the help I can get. You are right, I have never seen one installed. No
pressure though. I'm in no rush. Just doing my homework right now so I can
make sure that I get it right when I start on the installation. Don't want
to be cutting out unecessary holes on the body.

Which will require less cutting, the York or rotary? I was just thinking of
installing the York first to see how it should have been when installed by
the dealer. Then eventually shifting to a rotary compressor to have a more
efficient set up. Is this advisable? Or should I stick with just one? I
don't want to be cutting and patching up holes when I switch compressors.

Anyway, everything is in theory for me right now and I might be asking the
wrong questions. Maybe I should wait for your pictures first so I'll have a
clear idea on how I should go about it. Thanks.

Sherwin

&gt; Of course, you are correct, with the cutout templates for the fan shroud,
&gt; engine tin and inside floor missing, it will be a little
&gt; tougher...especially since it sounds like you have never seen one
&gt; installed?
