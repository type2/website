Subject: front curtain

Kevin

here's the easy way. Get a colorful sheet, flannel is nice, goodwill
have plenty for pennies.  I reccommend a pattern, it makes moonlight
more interesting :-)

Cut off 24inch along a long side - king size might wrap across, and
you'd have ready made hem!.  Get some stick on velcro - its even sold
in 99&quot; stores and supermarkets - a little pack of round buttons.
Stick one to each corner, one to the door post on each side, one over
the driving mirror. Put up the sheet and stick the velcro on it to
match! Done.  No sewing.

Of course you could do better, but this works. My 'sheet ' is blue
with sheep I can count (btw, with the rest of a queen sized sheet I
curtained the whole area.  $3)  This is especially great over the
back window, you do not need to hang curtains and block vision .

I also put the silver sunshade across the windshield, it stops light coming
in.

PS - just read about the magnets - thats even better as you only need
on curtain, not metal-bus! And velcro dries out.
