&gt;With all of the bad news from some folks about e-mail purchases gone wrong,
I just wanted to share news about one that went well.
I bought a rear table, pole, and water reservoir from Scott Shefferman
&lt;openmikeorlando_at_mpinet_dot_net&gt; in Orlando, Fla. He gave me a great price,
sent the parts to me right away upon receiving my money order.
The parts were great. Now my bus is just about complete.
All I have to find now, is an air conditioner (at the same time I have the
money to pay for it). I'm working on getting the roof painted out this week

Chris, I've got an entire a/c system._dot_compressor probably needing work,
stored in Fla. You can have it if you'll pick it up...when we get home next
month. It's aftermarket..but must have been a dealer installation..nice
underdash section and all. Did cut the belt to get it out..but ALL the rest
of the bits and pieces are there.
