&gt;If you raise your deckheight more than .060&quot;, you start loosing the benefit
&gt;of the squish factor. After your deckheight is much over .100&quot;, it's all but
&gt;gone.

i've been thinking about that! here are my specs:  measured deck 
height: 0.064&quot;  spacer size: 0.07&quot;  total: 0.134&quot;  CR: 6.93.1  but 
boy, it NEVER pings :)

i think i have some .03 spacers about... puts the CR at 7.5:1 if 
nothing else changes.

&gt;The ideal way to do it is to keep the deck height between .040&quot; and .060&quot;
&gt;and open the combustion chamber a bit to gain the extra cc's IMHO.


yeah, i  really learned the deck height stuff AFTER i'd already run 
out of money for more headwork  :p  i was annoyed that the head man 
who charged $$ to do a good job on em never asked about it when 
discussing the motor. the crazy homeless guy next door clued me in! 
(nick sharkey, if any one knew him... was allegedly a big name in vw 
circles in the late 60s/early 70s at iverson's).

  i need to reread my tech books this weekend...................
