Subject: backfiring under load

  Hello list.  Wondeing if anyone can give me some tech help?  Just drove my 
bus with a 1600 DP about 160 miles.  When I got off the highway about 
halfway through the journey, my engine started to backfire when any load was 
put on it.  Seems to have progressively got worse.  I am now stuck up in the 
backwoods of Vermont having mad anxiety attacks.  I am stressed about the 
trip home.  Anyway, some history.  Everything on the motor is new.  The 
motor is rebuilt and until now has run excellent.  I have had a problem just 
recently with the fuel pump getting clogged, and although it was new, I had 
to replace it.  I put a fuel filter in before the pump, and one after just 
to be safe.  I am hoping my fuel filter is clogged, for I have another and 
am planning to switch it out in a bit here.  My engine was just freshly 
timed, and the valves freshly adjusted.  Does this sound like fuel delivery 
issues? Any advice or suggestions would be a Godsend!   Thanks
