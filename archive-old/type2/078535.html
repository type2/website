Subject: generator light

oookaaayyyyy!

I've been trying for 2 hours to remove my generator backing plate  from the 
fan shroud and the darn bolt is stripped!  I got  a lifetime warranty on a 
bosch &quot;new&quot; generator and want to put it in.  I cannot find  a way to get it 
thos bolt out.

Suggestions?
Tap it to a larger bolt(rather keep stock though)....
smile!!
