Yes, that's right.  The list will return your message if it contains more 
than 50% quoted material.  The admins did this to keep you from having to 
scroll through pages of quoted material to find one or two lines of new 
text, both in realtime on the list and in the archives.

&gt;My gripe is that I haven't seen any
&gt;documentation for how to get around it.

The way &quot;around it&quot; is to not quote excessively.  It's not really that 
difficult!

&gt;  I found out, after posting a
&gt;similar query, that you have to delete a bunch of the &gt; signs from most of
&gt;the lines and only keep the first one...like I did below.

I suppose you could do that, but is it really worth the trouble?  It's much 
easier to just trim the quoted material.
