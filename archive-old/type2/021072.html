When making a camper, think of the major rooms in your house- bedroom,
bathroom, kitchen and figure the essence of each.
The quickest way to get a sleeping camper (German= Schlafwagen) out of a
bay is to (1) find a folding bedseat from a 74 Westy; it is full width
and will easily replace the rear seat.  It will store a lot of stuff
under the seat.  I did this to a 78 Westy, replacing the shorter 2/3 bed
seat.  see http://geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin  I also have a 75 hardtop
microbus and already have this spare bedseat waiting.  This Westy year
(74) also had a drop in closet that fits over the spare tire well. I
find little use for the closet in my 78 Westy other than to stuff
collapsible down comforters.  Everything else goes into portable bags
that get transferred to the front when camping.
(2) Make or get curtains for the side and rear windows- the Westy
curtain rods are good for this, or you can use velcro.  Westies use a
front curtain that snaps on around the windshield and side doors.
(3) Simplest kitchen duty is achieved by a cooler you can also sit on
and a portable propane stove.  I'm partial to the less bulky stoves that
attach to the top of a propane bottle.  They sit on the floor and are
high enough to cook while sitting down.  Usually I cook outside of the
van unless it's in the middle of winter.  I never use our sink because
it's under a &quot;Deluxe&quot; shelf and keep a gallon jug of water on hand.  The
sink/fridge seen in many early westies are impracticle (blocking the
sliding doorway and letting all the cool out); the laterones take away
seating and can be replaced by the cooler.  As for a table, I find the
later ones rather bulky and liked the 71 table we had that allows it to
flip up in front of the rear seat and lets one sit facing the rear,
requiring either a cooler/seat or a jumpseat.  In our 78 I made an
inside flipup table on the sliding door itself. (4) Bathroom functions
are best achieved by a Pakapotti from Sears; I glued a piece of plywood
to the top of mine so it can double as a stool and sewed a cover for it
that matches the plaid of the bedseat/front seats.  This potti is narrow
enough t o fit between the front seats.  For washing functions, you got
the gallon jug of water or keep wetwipes available from the baby section
of a market.
