John,

Wellll, I called MSD this morning and yes, you need part no MSD 8920,
$44.50 at Summit Racing, 1-800-230-3030, to make the Bosch FI work 
right. OUCH!  Oh well...

Mark

&gt; funny you ask this, I just emailed their tech people cause I have a 6AL I
&gt; bought cheap used and the idiot didn't respond correctly to the question.  I
&gt; recall reading years ago that you couldn't needed a diode and a resistor or
&gt; something for the FI lead, so if you actually call them to find out, I'd
&gt; appreciate if you dropped it to the list or me personally.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; John
