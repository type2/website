Subject: [T2] Linseed oil for inside rocker panels?

I was told that Linseed oil is a good thing to spray inside the rocker
panels to help prevent rusting, and lasts a good long time. I would like to
do this and then seal my panels which are open at the front end (directly
behind the front tires). I'd appreciate any tips on this from someone who
has done it.
Many thanks,
Courtney
