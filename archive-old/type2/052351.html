Subject: [T2] Input shaft and motor install (1600 into '76 bus)

Roy and Chad are working franticly to finish the nose job on the '76. Looks like it will be finished today. Now the focus turns to getting the motor in. The motor will be a 1600dp from a wrecked type1 (no economical type4 solution has presented it self so....) We are wondering about the input shaft. I have talked to two people that have snipped 3/8&quot; off the input shaft to allow the type1 motor to mate properly. Both examples involved 1976 model year and up tranniens. I recall this being an issue several years ago on the list and I recall some people had no trouble with the existing input shaft length. What is the story here? Is the length of the input shaft different for different years or is the bellhousing on the trannies different. If we can solve this by swapping a bell housing instead of cutting the shaft we would rather do that so as not to condemn tranny to type1hood forever. Please let us know!

Chris
