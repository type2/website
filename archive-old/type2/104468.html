&gt;If you recall we started that heated head gasket strand about our '78 bus.  We had the head gasket replaced but then the bus ran terribly. Our regular mechanic says that when we had the head gasket done it caused the compression to go up which caused it to suck in a valve seat.

I really doubt that had anything to do with it.  If it ran badly after the head gasket was replaced, then the job was not done properly and you should take it up with the mechanic that did the repair.  

&gt; So we have a bad valve on the number one cylinder.  His solution is to get a rebuilt engine, the thinking being along the line that if we replace any more parts it will just cause other parts to go bad.

It is this kind of paranoia that generates college tuition funds for mechanics.  Where did you get this idea?

Replacing parts does not &quot;cause other parts to go bad&quot;.  If another part fails after replacing something, it is either coincidence or that part was on the verge of failing anyway.

I do not like the sound of your &quot;regular mechanic&quot;.

&gt;  We can not afford a new engine so I am considering dropping the engine myself and and slapping a new or used cylinder head on to keep it going.  Any advise?  Does anyone have a good cylinder head?

&quot;Slapping a cylinder head on&quot; is not a good solution.  The best solution to your situation, IMO is to remove *both* heads and have them rebuilt by a reputable machine shop.  Another good solution would be to replace *both* heads with rebuilt units from AVP or other reputable rebuilder.  If you do the work yourself, either solution should come in around $500, give or take.  Anything less than this would be be money wasted, IMO.
