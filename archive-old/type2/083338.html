Subject: Re: [T2] Interior options

Hello Sherrie,

About the inverters, I think they work great! I bought
a 600w (750w peak I think) inverter a year ago on
clearance at Walmart. I was planning on using it in my
bus but my bus needs a new motor so first things
first. I put a 13inch color tv with stero speakers and
a super nintendo in my bus using this thing. It worked
great! Origionally this unit cost over $100 if I
remember correctly. I bought it on clearance for $70.
I will sell it to you for $50.00 if you want it. I was
going to use it on my bus  but what good is a bus with
a TV if it cant even drive out of the yard. let me
know if you are interested. I will find it tomorrow
and give you more details about it if you are
interested. 

Have a great day!
David Kelly

&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm planning on turning my '78 Bus into a camper
&gt; and I was wondering if
&gt; &gt; &gt;there are any reference materials, books,
&gt; magazines on the types of
&gt; &gt; &gt;options available? Can I buy after-market option
&gt; or do I just cannibalize
&gt; &gt; &gt;old buses and make it fit?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suggest you do your own thing.  Use some stock
&gt; Westy stuff, make some things,
&gt; &gt; and use some over the counter things that never
&gt; came stock.  Unless of
&gt; &gt; course, you
&gt; &gt; can afford that English camper interior you've
&gt; been told about.  Nice!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, personally, I've got a stock '70 Westy, and
&gt; the layout isn't all that
&gt; &gt; great.
&gt; &gt; The icebox is tiny, front opening, and basically
&gt; useless.  The later
&gt; &gt; refrigerators,
&gt; &gt; so I've heard endlessly, are nothing but trouble. 
&gt; Following Bob Hoover's
&gt; &gt; advice
&gt; &gt; (he hangs out for weeks down in Baja) I got a
&gt; super-insulated Igloo
&gt; &gt; cooler--not the
&gt; &gt; un-insulated sort available everywhere.  The
&gt; cooler can now be taken out of
&gt; &gt; the bus,
&gt; &gt; as well as used as a seat (with appropriate sized
&gt; cushion) at the table.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The rear facing seat (on a '70) is slightly too
&gt; small for a porta-potty, so
&gt; &gt; I'm going to
&gt; &gt; make a near duplicate that isn't.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Curtains are better held in place with rare earth
&gt; magnets sown into the seams,
&gt; &gt; than the stock aluminum tracks with little plastic
&gt; thingees sliding in
&gt; &gt; them, and snaps.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The stock things I'd use are the folding bed with
&gt; storage underneath (or a
&gt; &gt; Z-bed),
&gt; &gt; the folding table, and the shelf above the bed. 
&gt; If your passenger seat
&gt; &gt; swivels around
&gt; &gt; to face the rear, as the later Westies did, then
&gt; use the later style table
&gt; &gt; to take advantage
&gt; &gt; of this seat.  If not, then use the early table
&gt; position, and put an early
&gt; &gt; loaf sink/water supply/
&gt; &gt; ice cooler cabinet behind the passenger seat, but
&gt; replace the ice cooler
&gt; &gt; with storage
&gt; &gt; cabinets.  Aside from those, you can really do
&gt; better going non-stock.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bob Hoover discussed his thoughts on the
&gt; matter--he lives in his bus a
&gt; &gt; lot--somewhere
&gt; &gt; or other in his writings, which you can find here:

&gt; Rik,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much. I am going to print this
&gt; message out and keep it to refer to.
&gt; I am thinking of building a custom cabinet to house
&gt; my DVD player and TV which
&gt; will reside behind the front drivers seat so I can
&gt; watch from bed. The DVD is
&gt; already set up for 12V but the TV I'm looking at is
&gt; a standard 13&quot; using regular
&gt; 110V plug. ( I work for a DVD/TV manufacturer so I
&gt; have access to  these items). I
&gt; have heard of a power inverter but I'm not sure if
&gt; this is the route I should go
&gt; or if I should get a video source already made for
&gt; automotive applications even
&gt; though the screen size is so much smaller.  Any
&gt; thoughts? I realize I will need an
&gt; extra battery but I am getting conflicting opinions
&gt; from the guys at work on
&gt; wether to get a standard battery or a marine
&gt; battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Buster is going into the shop next week to get his
&gt; mechanicals fixed, after which
&gt; I will be looking for interior parts and especially
&gt; a z bed.
&gt; 
&gt; I love the curtain idea. Sounds perfect but does
&gt; this mean I have to learn to sew?
&gt; I knew I should have paid attention in Home Ec. It's
&gt; pretty sad when a good little
&gt; Mormon girl from Utah can't even sew or can peaches!
&gt; :) I'm sure I can get one of
&gt; my friends to do the sewing honors.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for the help!
&gt;
