As a matter of fact, it does!  it is somewhat limited in tongue
weight, but you can pull a ton with it if you have the proper hitch.

The bad news is that any weight towed in a trailer (and the weight of
the trailer itself) has to be deducted from the weight carried inside
the bus itself.  

I, personally would not want to tow much more than 600 pounds or so,
for braking and handling considerations.  Weight carried inside the
bus contributes to braking traction, while weight carried in a trailer
does not (unless the trailer is braked).
