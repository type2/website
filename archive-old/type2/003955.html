 At light throttle cruise you can run the full advance of 38 - 40 degrees
&gt; with the mech / vac distributor.  When you get into a load condition or
&gt; full throttle application, your vacuum falls to 0, or near 0, degrees
&gt; and you are in effect using only the mechanical portion of your
&gt; distributor which is engine speed dependent.

Mike,
How many times do you need to be corrected for this false info??
A vacuum advance uses PORTED vacuum. PORTED vacuum comes from ABOVE the
throttle plate. The MORE you open the throttle, the MORE vacuum you have.
PORTED vacuum comes off the venturi.
If you are full throttle and you have zero vacuum, you better check your
tach. You seized your engine and you have no air flow into the engine.
