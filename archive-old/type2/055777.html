Subject: RE: Another ext. oil filter question...

&gt; &gt;I recently saw a buddy's bug with an external oil filter and cooler
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;was hooked up via an adapter plate bolted where the stock oil cooler
&gt; &gt;used to be.  This time I DID check the sermons before asking and
&gt; &gt;couldn't find any mention of such a thing.  Anyone using one?  Good
&gt; &gt;idea?  Bad idea?  Anyone wish I'd stop asking questions yet?
&gt; 
I've gotten several replies to this question from very good sources.
They range from &quot;Don't do it - very bad idea&quot; on up to &quot;I used one for
150k miles and it worked fine&quot; (neither are exact quotes.)

Here's what I've summised so far:
BAD:
 -- Removal of stock air cooler eliminates forced air over cooler
(remedy by putting a fan on the external cooler).
 -- Not the ideal place to position a cooler/filter because it's after
the flow to the bearings, not before.
 -- Possible issue of having to move more oil through longer lines may
restrict volume (offset by using bigger oil pump?).

GOOD:
 -- Removes the stock cooler that heats up the air blowing over #3
cylinder.
 -- With the external cooler, filter, and lines, it adds more than a
quart of oil.
 -- Easy place to access/bolt on setup.  No clearance problems and no
tapping/permanent mods to the case, but allows use of a full-size Fram
filter and larger oil cooler.
 -- If you break an oil line in this location, your bearing will
continue getting oil for a (very) short time whereas if you're tapped
for full flow and break a line, you run dry immediately.

OK, so lets think about this for a second.  The idea that the oil would
be filtered AFTER the bearings make the filter a lot less effective, but
should still provide some benefit.  Moving the cooler to a better
location makes a lot of sense to me.  My guess is that if you don't use
a fan on the cooler with this setup, that you'll run WAY to hot in
stop-and-go traffic (NO air flow across the cooler when not moving), but
if you put a nice, big, high volume electric fan (900cfm or more) on
your cooler that it would be more effective than the stock one and it
would get that hot air off of #3 cylinder!

So if this would be such a great way to cool your engine, why didn't VW
do it themselves? 

 -- Number 1: Twenty, 30 and 40 years ago electric fans that would have
moved enough air were either not available (too much current draw)
and/or too expensive.  Don't forget, car manufacturers like to make
money and if it cost them an extra $150/car, well....
 -- Number 2: If your electric fans quits you don't have any way to know
and you'll start overheating due to lack of air flow.  I'm going to talk
to an electronics guru friend of mine and see if you could hook up
something in the power wire that will trigger a relay (and dummy light)
if the voltage draw drops.

Anyone have any other thoughts, opinions, criticisms, don't give a rat's
hairy ass, etc?
