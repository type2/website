Subject: muffler installation prolem

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1FC02.8D4889C0

I am having some problems installing my muffler to my heat exchangers.  C=
an not seem to get the muffler all the way on.  Almost seems like it's be=
nt.  Can anyone give me any advice on the installation?  I checked my man=
uals, and consulted the list library, but didn't fid anything on fitting =
the muffler to the exchangers, except the section on welding flanges.  I =
would like to try to fit it without doing that.  Get more from the Web.  =
