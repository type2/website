Subject: [T2] dont forget about yer hatch! or the Bus Break-In

Hello,

Just a quick reminder. When your locking up your bus dont forget about the 
hatch. You wouldnt think someone would crawl through the bus via the hatch 
but it happened.

I parked in a sketchy area of town last night. In the back of the bus was a 
full container of oil waiting to be properly disposed of, extra gas gan, and 
losts of random crap from the recent move I did. Once you get over the back 
seat, your confronted with getting over the extra rear seat, and westy 
cabinets that I have floating around in there. Then, they unlocked the front 
door and proceeded to take all the good stuff.

Thats what I hate about thieves, they leave all the crap ive been trying to 
get out of the bus, and took all the stuff I wanted in there when the crap 
was gone.

Stolen items list : extra oil filter/fuel filter/one plug/coleman lantern/ 
maglight/ spare change/6x9's in their carpet boxes/mini-crowbar

Items I wish had been stolen : old oil, dirty rags, the bag of tapes I dont 
like anymore, jack in the box food from yesterday, the little pieces of rock 
from tranporting cinder blocks around the other day.

Items i was happy to see still there ; My tape deck! My $300 sony tape deck 
was still there!! / my front speakers - hey at least I can still listen to 
something / fire extinguisher/ new kick panels for someone elses bus/ my 
muir book (that would have been just too much bad karma for one person)/ and 
my tools.

So lesson learned, ill be checking to make sure that hatch is locked in the 
future each and every time.
