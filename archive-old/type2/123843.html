&gt; I took out both carbs and cleaned them somewhat with acetone.

Hi,

This is not the correct way to clean a carburetor. You need to go to your 
local auto parts supply house and buy the one gallon can of carburetor soak, 
the kind that comes with a basket in it to dip your parts. You strip down 
your carburetor all the way down to the main body, being sure all rubber and 
plastic parts are removed, and soak the whole carburetor. Usually you have 
to soak the top and bottom halves separately because they both won't fit in 
the can. Read the instructions. There is a time limit. If you soak too long, 
you will destroy the finish on the carb.

When you are done, rinse it out with carb cleaner spray. You must then use 
compressed air to blow out all the drilled holes in the carburetor body. 
This is the only way to be sure your carb is fully clean inside and out.
