&gt;Now you know why I wrote that!
&gt;
&gt;There is a Genuine Volkswagen switch that does fit, but we have to import it
&gt;ourselves.  Our part number is 211 941 531E.  It's a bit more ($39.95), but
&gt;then again, it's a real VW part, not Chinese, and it fits.  In other words,
&gt;it's a good part cheap, not a cheap part.  We have about 10 on hand at the
&gt;moment.

Ron,

Sometime ago, I ordered 211 941 531E from your catalog and received 211 941 531B.  The B version was the original at the time the bus was built, in 1978 at least so I was expecting E figuring it was the latest replacement part number.

The B version is made in Mexico and it indeed fits but why does the catalog say E when B is what's available as Genuine VW?

For the original poster:
In my opinion the new Mexican made switch isn't well made and I decided to go with a german junkyard switch.  To be fair, I did have to pull 8 from different busses until I found one that was electrically ok with a nice &quot;action&quot;. Many were sloppy and many didn't make my continuity checker beep.

For those that are junkyard hunting an original switch is embossed with VW on the bottom and the part number is stamped into the metal on top.  A mexican one will have both IDs painted on the bottom.
