Subject: RE: [T2] 75-78 Muffler notes

Volks,

With fairly limited exceptions, I tend to do all my own exhaust work.
When it is just too cold out, or if I need to pass inspection with no time
left, I would take it to a VW specialist shop.  I would not go to Midas or
any other chain because I have had too many bad experiences with them.

The exhaust system on a 75-78 bus originally consisted of a rather amazing
11 separate pieces! As I remember, back in the 80s, when all the parts
were available, the cost of a complete system from VW was on the order of
$1500.   These days, the weak points on the system seem to me to be:

the original crossover pipe is no longer available.
the flanges on all the rest of the parts are becoming warped and corroded
the support bars are often missing or fractured.

The solutions to the NLA crossover pipe are either to replace the whole
system with the '72-74 system or to replace the rear section (crossover
pipe, Y-pipe, muffler, and tailpipe) with an aftermarket muffler.

Neither of these solutions is satisfactory if you live in California, and
have a '78 as neither will accept the catalytic converter that you need to
pass smog.  Keep searching thru junkyards is your only solution I am sorry
to say.

Bent flanges can be banged and/or ground flat. I have had pretty good luck
attacking mine with an angle grinder to flatten them.  If they are
heavily corroded, tho, you may be out of luck.  At one point, I heard that
someone was making replacement flanges to be welded onto old pipes, but
that was a vague rumor.  Anyone know anything  of this?

Supports...  originally there was a support for the exhaust system at all
four corners of the block.  In addition, these suports were &quot;hard&quot;, that
is they were metal straps bolted to the block and exhaust with no rubber
shock section.  I personally think this was not one of VW's finer moments,
since every other exhaust support I have ever seen had a rubber section to
take up vibration.

As a result of the hard nature of the supports, over the years most of
them have broken, which leaves the entire 40-50 pound sustem hanging from
the heads.  This exerts a *lot* of lever force on the heads and is a
really bad thing.  At very least, make sure there is a support at the rear
corners of the system.

The right side rear support was originally from a nut and bolt thru the
bottom of the bracket that holds the alternator clamped. It was bloted to
a tab on the crossover pipe.  If you look down there, you will probably
see that the hole is egged out or worn thru and/or the tab on the pipe is
worn thru.  The solutions are to get a replacement alternator bracket or
to take the old bracket to a welder and have them weld a plate onto the
old bracket and drill it.  Likewise, if the tab on top of the crossover
pipe is gone.

The left side rear support was a metal bar from the fan shroud to one of
the bolts on the rear flange of the heater box.  I went looking at a FLAPS
and found a generic muffler hanger with a rubber strap in the center that
has been supporting my left side heater box very happily for quite a while
now.  I would love to be able to rig something like this on the right
side, but I am not up to the McGyvery required :-)
