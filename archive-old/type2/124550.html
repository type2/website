Subject: Oil cooler heater.....

Has any one ever done this???

 

Heat the inside of your bus by running an &quot;AUX oil cooler&quot; INSIDE the bus's
cabin and thus heat the inside of your bus while cooling the oil for your
engine.

 

If I do this it will be on a Type 4 2L motor

 

Thoughts..

Suggestions.

 

Thanx
