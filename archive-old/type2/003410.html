For 20+ years we've carried a 2-burner Coleman propane stove under the back
seat/bed of our Campmobiles.  We have a small refillable propane tank for
fuel, and an approximately 10' long hose to connect the two.  The stove was
originally designed to use disposable propane canisters, and that
arrangement works well but is expensive.  The bulk tank adapter we use is a
Coleman product.

This is an extremely flexible setup.  In decent weather we set up the stove
on the end of the table typically found in a State or National Park
campground, with the tank under the table wherever convenient.  The stove
also fits nicely on the folding shelf on the side of the Campmobile sink
unit with the sliding door open.

Later Westfalia conversions (ours is a 1970) have &quot;cookers&quot; inside and that
seems to work out OK, but careful ventilation is a must.

The PO of our '70 had a 2-burner RV stove installed in a custom cabinet
where the Westfalia rear-facing jumpseat normally lives.  I removed this and
re-installed a jumpseat.  The overhead paneling above the stove's location
is badly heat damaged, clearly illustrating the need for careful
consideration of heat shield and ventilation considerations.

FWIW.....
