&gt;You can

I wish they wouldn't keep changing the size. If you ever let the jiffydrip change your oil don't believe for a second their filter won't be some weird size and shape that doesn't fit your adapter. Thank goodness the bus filter never changes.

&gt;When I got home I decided to 
&gt;change the oil in my GTI. The spot welds securing the band on the oil 
&gt;filter broke off the first time I brought it up tight.

I've never found a good one that was universal enough. Unless it's an absolute requirement because of location I find one of those rubber discs for removing the tops of pickle jars works very well.

Has anyone actually had the oil filter fall off on any car they've owned?

&gt;I sure hope the TSP doesn't boil the &quot;enamel&quot; off my pot.

That's a brain tickler if you also bought your TSP at wallmart: it may not contain any.

&gt;Oh, and the only coveralls they had were insulated. In San Diego.

For the last 15 years I've been wearing coveralls from one of the local commercial cleaning companies. When I was in high school we used to get coverals for about $12. They were used but clean and still had the mechanic's name patch sewed onto them. When my favorite pair shrunk (ahem) I had a difficult time finding a place that sold them (I didn't like any of the Dickie's versions in the work wear stores) so I went back to that same place and although they didn't have any recyclyed ones they did sell me a new one so I bought two pairs hoping the spare doesn't shrink on me (ahem).
