Subject: Try to get 12pt cv bolts (vs 6 pt) when reinstalling the axles.

I'm not sure about YOUR cv bolts, but when I replaced  a cv axle on my '70 bus
a couple of yrs ago, I used 12 pt bolts (bolt heads) instead of the original 6
pt bolts that came out. They're available from several parts companies. You
will have to buy a 12 pt allen type socket tool. but even Mac or Snap-On's are
only about $10 bucks. I think they'll  come out somewhat easier  if you have
to remove the axle ever again.

Just a thought, Bernie
