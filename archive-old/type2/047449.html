&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I am not sure it is the cold start. Another thing the shop forgot to do
&gt; was
&gt; &gt;reconnect the cold start, but the bus started any way with me pumping
&gt; some
&gt; &gt;gas into it via the gas pedal.
	[Crick, Bill ]  Its not really a gas pedal, its an Air Pedal.
	It controls the amount of air going into the engine, and 
	the FI adds the appropriate amount of gas.
