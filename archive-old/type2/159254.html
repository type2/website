Subject: Re: [T2] Dellorto Carbs Starting Procedure

 &gt; How do other dual dellorto owners get their engines started in the 
morning? 66 Westy w/ plain jane 1600 engine.

wow, that's a ton of carb for a 1600!!  I have dual 36's on my 1776 with 
big valve+ported 041 heads. . . my starting procedure:

-I have a separate switch for my coil--I leave it OFF and crank for 
about 6-8 seconds to build up oil pressure through my full flow remote 
filter

-when I see oil pressure start to rise on my gauge I pump the pedal 
~twice to get some gas in there and turn the coil ON to fire.

-after the 2 pumps I usually hold down the pedal 1/5 to 1/4 (think maybe 
~4mm at the throttle plate) till it fires, this will give the engine a 
more balanced mixture plus some air to lean out the ton of gas I just 
pumped in there with the two strokes.   Once  engine roars I have to 
goose it a little for about 20-30 seconds till it will hold idle.

. . . because I have found that DRLAs on my engine tend to run VERY rich 
at low idle (throttles closed with miniscule gap, synched with 
synchrometer, CB sez starting point is 0.004&quot;) even once the mix is 
tuned down for a snappy off-idle transition, maybe I don't have the 
right jets but let's face it, these are huge carbs compared to a stock 
single 34. I use 60 idle jets.  if you don't hold the pedal down a 
little bit it will be getting a very rich mixture.

as a corollary--for hot start, it is easy to flood with too much gas, so 
what I do is push the pedal down halfway (only once and hold) and start 
cranking, when it sees a lean enough mixture it will roar to life.  
pumping more than once will cause the cranking time to increase before 
all the excess raw gas is blown out. . . YMMV

that reminds me I still need to lean my mixture for my new 6300' 
altitude. . .
