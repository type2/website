Subject: RE: new Bosch starter closeout

&gt; I say jump, jump on it with a passion, if you want to guarantee the lowest
&gt; possible cost to replace that 20 year old original at any time between now
&gt; and when the original begins to show the symptoms of having served in
&gt; upstanding manner a full functional life. Put one on the shelf.
&gt;
&gt; If you wait till failure of the orginal a few years from now, you may only
&gt; be able to get a reman from the New Bosch reman factory in MEXICO, and pay
&gt; much more than this no brainer price for junk.
&gt;
&gt; Opportunity be-a-knocking real hard here. Value up the ying-yang.


To be fair, these, too, are built by Bosch in Mexico, not Germany (as is
much of Bosch's product these days; their remans generally aren't
remaufactured in Germany either).  But these are brand new, not the
remanufactured ones that are coming out of the same factory.  These were
another &quot;gray market&quot; find, apparantly originally intended for distribution
outside of the U.S. (And outside of South America, I suppose, given that the
Mexi-busses don't use this starter.)  I'm not sure why Bosch has been
shipping only remanufactured ones to us here in the U.S., when this proves
that their factory is/was equipped to build new ones.  Perhaps these were
meant for countries where Bosch doesn't have a strong aftermarket presence
and isn't equipped to process core deposits/returns.  Who knows.  In any
event, for $99 brand new, versus about 50% more for the reman Bosch (plus
core), it's definately a no-brainer.
