Well, I've been away for a week taking a couple of friends on a quick 
tour of the Bay area and Yosemite in a '75 westy  (with a '78 2.0 engine).

Normally I wouldn't post a road trip report, but after seeing the current 
spate of unreliable bus messages I figured I'd post a 'no hitches 
whatsoever message'.

yep. 900 miles last week. no glitches, nothing to report.

for anyone planning a Yosemite trip soon. the place is nice and quiet 
now. but it's definately a 4 boxes of wood weekend.

Nights were really cold, but the olympian propane heater kept things 
bearable (with the roof popped).  Normally for really cold weather I keep 
the roof down as all the heat leaves through the canvass. 

anyone have any good ideas for useable insulation here?

Saw a couple of splitties up there, a few vanagons, got the 'peace' sign 
loads of times, and generally had a great VW week.

Dave.
'75 Westy.
