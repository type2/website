Hmmm, so why are we allowing all these bays to go to the crusher. Sounds
like money to be made shipping these to OZ. Its really a crime in SoCal when
you see these dry straight buses going to the crusher 'cause they blew an
engine and you know with the late stuff its probably just bad heads. I've
said it before, with the prices people are asking for splits its only a
matter of time before the speculators start snatching up bay windows and
driving up prices. ok time to get off the soap box

.
&gt; looking for a set for my '74 Campmobile since I got it, and I'll be soon
after
&gt; another set if I pick up the '72 crewcab I've been asking about ).
&gt;
&gt; Even the VW specialty shops don't have any luck sourcing vent windows
here, the
&gt; guys I go to have tried ordering from the UK and everywhere else, without
much
&gt; luck.
