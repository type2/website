&gt; What type of switch should I use besides the timer switch. Is 
&gt; there a cheaper alternative? Those can be a little pricey

yeah my timer switch isn't working right either, I got a 60 amp toggle
switch (fused at 40amp) from a local electronics supply house (Baynesville
Electronics) for under $10

I'm a bit paranoid and have 3 different shut off switches, master power,
fuel pump, and push button start switch...made a panel that fits where the
ash tray was (don't smoke) so it doesn't deface the dashboard....
