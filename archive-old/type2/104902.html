Subject: Re: [T2] Incorrectly installed timing gea

&gt; Are you saying that you can't adjust the timing correctly by turning the
&gt; distributor?

Essentially, yes.  I can turn the dizzy to the point where the static
timing light flares up at the crankcase seam, but the engine will not
start or run there.  If I adjust the timing by ear, then the timing notch
is about 1.5 inches ATDC rather than about 1/2&quot; as expected. 

I think in my original post on this thread, I erroneously used BTDC where
I meant ATDC.  Sorry for confusion.

Greg
