&gt;However -- and this is odd -- after we got the plugs back in, I did the
&gt;test where you pull the wires off the distributor one at a time to see
&gt;if the engine falters. The #2 plug did not, so that cylinder's not
&gt;pulling its weight. We've got spark at the plug wire at the distributor
&gt;end, spark at the plug wire at the plug end, and spark from the plug.
&gt;The plug is properly gapped and not fouled, and seated well. We've got
&gt;115 lbs of compression. I stayed another night so we could troubleshoot
&gt;during the daytime, but it's a mystery. Wassssssuuuuuppppp?

Check the resistance of the plug wire, it shouldn't be more than 3,000 ohms
per foot.  Also, I have run into a number of plugs that will fire outside
the engine, but put them under compression and they just won't work.  Also
look inside the cap for spark trails.

Under compression, it takes a lot more voltage to jump the gap and
electricity will always take the path of least resistance such as a carbon
path in the distributor cap, or a short to ground in the plug wire.

Always use Bosch plugs, Champions have an extra thread at the bottom and
will carbon up, then when you take the plug out, the carbon in the thread
can ruin the threads in the head.
