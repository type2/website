&gt; &gt;My other question is... Why?
&gt;
&gt; My answer would have to be: &quot;Why not?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 	Shying away from the convenience of a self-adjusting clutch setup seems as
&gt; sensible to me as refraining from fuel-injection and pointless ignition.  I
&gt; have owned more than a few vehicles with hydraulic clutches, and (as long as
&gt; they are properly maintained, just like the brake hydraulics) have never
&gt; suffered a leak, much less a catastrophe.  To each their own, I always say
&gt; though.  If the 'upgrade' is too difficult, or seems unnecessary, don't
&gt; undertake the process.  I don't know about you folks, but my wife is 5 foot
&gt; 3 and can barely provide the braking and clutch power necessary to control
&gt; my '70.

Hydraulics provide no more mechanical advantage than a mechanical system.
they have a bit less friction, but a bus has a very straight shot to the
clutch and has virtually no friction anyway.  If you're looking to
hydraulics to reduce pedal effort, you'll have to carefully engineer the
cylinder sizes to allow a greater mechanical advantage.  The problem then
is getting enough disengagement so that the clutch will not drag.  It
would be a whole lot easier to simply shorten the lever arm of the cable
hook on the clutch pedal.  Any competent welder could do the job in an
hour.  You'll get the same effect at a lot less cost and hassle.

My wife is a skosh over 5' and easily handles the stock clutch in our
'71 bus as well as the cable operated clutch in her '69 bug.  I think it's
more a matter of what she is used to than any defect in the bus.

&gt; Adding power-discs and a hydraulic clutch is a way to include my
&gt; wife in the pleasure we all share while driving our vehicles.

Since my wife came equipped with a bug and a squareback when I met her I
didn't have that problem :)
