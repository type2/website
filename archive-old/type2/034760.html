Subject: Re: Anyone buy the Bus Depot Stainless Exhaust?

&gt;I bought the Stainless muffler from Bus Depot about two months 
&gt;ago. I have about 300 miles on it now. I have nothing to compare 

I got one too.  Put it on the day before Christmas and have 3000 miles on it
already.  Nice looking piece of metal!!  The included tailpipe is a heavier
gauge metal than the aftermarket replacement pipe I had put on my original
muffler a few years back so should last fairly well.  As compared to the
27-year old original muffler I was running, I can't tell any difference in
performance, but the sound level is MUCH lower!!  And as Merideth stated,
the fit of the muffler was perfect and I think the SS casing will make the
thing last a nice long time.  Well worth the few extra bucks in my opinion.
