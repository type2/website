&gt; You say it normally runs at idle? So if you kick up 
&gt;the accelerator can you get double the amount of
&gt; CFM for those serious jobs??

I don't think so. There appears to be a rev limit.
The pump cylinder valves run in two-cycle mode.
There are double lobes on the cam for pump valves.
So, if the engine runs at 1500 rpm, the pump
valves are operating at 3000 rpm. 
Operating pressure is obtained at low engine speed.
The cam specs are &quot;trade secret&quot;. You can
degree the cam yourself, of course, but it doesn't 
explain how pressure increase drops off dramatically
once operating parameters are achieved.
