     On the other hand, I was in my Bus in a parking space, when an elderly 
woman back-
ing into the space behind me, clipped my left rear corner. I got out to look 
at it and in-
form her of what she had done. She politely looked at the damage (slight to 
be sure),
and said, with a smile, &quot;Oh, that's okay, it's just an old car anyway...&quot;
