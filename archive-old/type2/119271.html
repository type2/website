Subject: RE: [T2] New Exhaust Needed!

&gt;  I have a 1973 with the 1800 motor (not original). 
&gt;, I want it to look completely stock. What exhaust system 
&gt; would you guys recommend as a replacement for my Pace Setter 
&gt; dual exhaust system? I'd like to get something that has only 
&gt; one exit pipe (like the Buses had from the factory). 


I'm a big fan of the stock system for this year range, as it is very
durable, relatively non-restrictive, fits properly, and is not
expensive. A complete stock system (complete with OEM European made
muffler, tailpipe, and install kit) is only $152, with your 5%
listmember discount. That's the way to go.  Link:
