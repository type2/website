Subject: Re: [T2] bus steering wheel, how to restore finish...

Any suggestions on how to bring it back? Armor-all doesn't work.

Someone recently posted that a laquer(?) paint would do the trick.  Check 
the archives at the Type2 website to find the post, or if the person who 
posted initially wouldn't mind?  Please tell us again?

	Eron
