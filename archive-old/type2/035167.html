Subject: Interesting Radio

Hi,

Just bought my '68 Westy and it has a three band radio in it which we found
rather odd although this may not be? The third band doesn't seem to pick up
anything at all and the bands are labeled U, L and M. I have the schematic
in the manuals I got with my camper.

Can anyone tell me what this third band is for?

Thanks,
Jen
