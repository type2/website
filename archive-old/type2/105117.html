Subject: Re: [T2] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

&gt; What brand and wattage are everyone using in the Buses&gt;  Are you doing the
&gt; Relay routing?  I'm getting closer the starting that phase.

Standard H4s are 55/60W: the same wattage as the stock lights so no wiring
improvements are required. If you already have a noticeable voltage drop at
the headlights (measure it) because the long wire from the engine to fuse
panel is culprit you can decide what to do.

Info from the Hella relay catalog: Voltage vs. Luminous Intensity...

13.50V (100%) 100%
12.83V (95%)  83%
12.15V (90%)  67% (not a big drop but only 2/3 a bright)
11.47V (85%)  53%

I'd like to put in a relay if only to take to load off the headlight switch.

According to the wiring diagrams, the stock wiring is 2.5mm which is just a
little bigger than 14 AWG so the wiring can handle about 15AMPS. If you put
in 80/100W bulbs, the fuses may just be on the verge on blowing on high beam
but the wire will definitely be under stress.

A quality H4 housing with running normal wattage lamps will look just like
poor quality unit running 80/100W bulbs. And there are even higher wattage
bulbs.

Sylvania and Osram are the familiar brands at the local flaps when I live. I
find some stores don't have great stock of these bulbs so you might want to
call ahead and save some gas and frustration.

Sylvania H4 Halogen
Osram Bilux H4 64193

Both are $10 and Made in Germany. At first it would seem any motorcycle
store will carry H4s because they are the de-facto for most models but they
often sell junk and sometimes cost $15-$20. Avoid them.

Bosch makes an H4 but I don't know the part number to order one.

Sylvania has a premium H4 called SilverStar for $24. Not worth it.
