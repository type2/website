Subject: rebuild running!

Thanks for your help.  I ran it for about 20 minutes today at extremely 
low loads.  I couldn't just sit at the apt and hold rpms, so I moved 
down the street really slowly and pissed off the neighbors ;)

Anyways, it's running super smooth and hasn't leaked a drop of oil (my 
old one leaked like a sieve).  I'm gonna let it cool down, change the 
oil, adjust the valves, and then break it in some more!

later,
mike
