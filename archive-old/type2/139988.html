Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Front Door Seals- glue or not?

Hiya Mike,

There is another factor to consider in using adhesive to secure the door 
seals.  

If you do not use adhesive in the channels away from the hinge side of the 
door, you will allow the seal to shift around a bit to find it's own fit.  I 
always install seals this way.  After a few weeks I go back and gently pull the 
seal in a few places and give it a daub of adhesive.  That seems to secure it 
for the long run and the seal has had a chance to &quot;seat itself&quot;.
