Subject: Cleaning upholstery/armrests needed ('81 Vanagon)

I recently stripped lots of goodies off an '84 GL (which
had NO RUST... weirdest thing I ever saw here in SLC),
including (front) seats.  It's amazing that the seats off a van
made in 1985 will fit my September '80 Westy!  Also snagged
a new gas tank to replace my rusted-through one -- in this
case the filler tube had changed but the tank was IDENTICAL.
Amazing.

Anyway, the seats are pretty nice (although an armrest is
missing and another one is wiggly) but they're real dirty/
greasy.  How can I clean these things?  I'm sure Gojo
will take out the grease (Gojo is my secret weapon --
used it to clean my filthy block when I was rebuilding the
engine!).

Also, if you have any armrests laying around in your parts bus
let me know!

Thanks

        Gary
