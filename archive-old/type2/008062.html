A big THANK YOU to Karl for hooking me up with 
4 cabinet handels for my 76 Westy. I'm only 
in need of three more now!! If anyone has any extras sitting around or knows where I might get some here in Atlanta I'd appreciate it. Please email me directly if you have any info. Once again, Thanks to Karl!

Also, I've only had my bus for a while now and have yet to hook it up. Is it difficult or do I need any extensions or anything to hook up water?

Greg
76 Westy
