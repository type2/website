Hiya Dan,  

     Is that part of your original sunroof or a piece of sheet metal?
I wonder if something like the bus on your homepage would work. But instead 
of the wheels riding along a race on top, you could have them run in the 
sliding tracks.

Lots of daydreams are running in my head now.

By the way, I liked your webpage.
