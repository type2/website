Subject: rear x-member

Hi folks.  It's been a while since I last posted.

My oil pump is leaking and I'm also thinking of welding flanges on my 
muffler inlet pipes but the rear x-member is blocking access to both.  I 
haven't seen any other years besides '68 but I have been told that the 
x-member isn't used on some later upright engines.  Is this true?  Is it 
there to provide lateral support for the body when the rear apron is out or 
is it supporting the weight of the case in the rear?

Will I need to support the case when removing the x-member to gain access to 
the oil pump and those annoying ring clamps on the muffler inlets?  Any 
advice is welcome.
