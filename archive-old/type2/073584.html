Subject: 78 Westy for sale in Seattle

Hello list,
Due to some recent financial problems I am forced to sell my 78 Westfalia =
Deluxe that I was planning on restoring over the winter.  I bought this =
bus about a month ago and it is currently not running.  The PO was a =
mechanic and replaced one of the heads.  He said it was runnning in April =
but had been sitting ever since.  I just havent had the time to try and =
get it running.  The engine is very clean and everything is there.  The =
body on this westy is excellent for the price.  No major dents and =
virtually no rust!  Very restorable.  has the sink, stove, fridge, double =
upper bunk, swivel seat, dash table, auxillary battery etc..  Canvas needs =
to be replaced and the interior needs some TLC but everything is there.  =
Newer oversize tires on it.  I hate to sell it but its parked in the =
street and Im getting some dirty looks from the neighboors.  Plus I =
already have 78 Transporter.  Well worth $500.  Please email if interested =
or know of someone who is. =20

Thanks,
Chad=20
