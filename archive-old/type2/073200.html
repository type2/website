Subject: Re: Westie pop-tops: sleeping 4 in a 74 vs.71?
Message-Id: &lt;v0311070cb3503dd38b29_at_[24.95.99.144]&gt;

&gt; Anyone have experience sleeping a family of 4 in a '71? How does that
&gt;  work? What about two (male) fishing buddies who aren't terribly
&gt;  homophobic but prefer not to sleep in each other's arms?

We've slept a family of five in the 68, same layout, but the kids are
small. Kids fit nicely because they can sleep sideways where grownups
can't. We often sleep one child under the Z-bed on the floor, on egg-crate
foam.

If a child is smallish, she can sleep nicely in the walkthrough (in
addition to the one under the Z-bed). Again this requires foam as there is
an uneven floor surface. I know it looks like a very small space to a
grownup but when our girls were 4 and 5 they loved to sleep there.

I think this is a minority opinion but we have found the child's cot to be
better suited to gear storage than to sleeping children. However for gear
storage it is absolutely indispensible.

Two men sleeping on the Z-bed would require a lot of toleration. I don't
think I'd try that if there were an alternative.
