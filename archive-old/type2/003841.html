Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire for 75 bus, donut?

&gt; Curious if there is anyone who has seen or knows of a place to find a
spare
&gt; tire for a bus that is very narrow like a donut tire.  I took my big spare
&gt; off the front of my bus because I wanted the emblem not a tire up there
but
&gt; I also don't want it in the spare tire place in the back of the bus taking
&gt; up room, what I want is the tire under the Z bed couch,  or I could put a
&gt; narrow tire in the storage compartment above the drivers head.

I assume you mean the blow-up/collapsible spare that came in 75 deluxe
Westies along with a little compressor and stored under the sink unit?
That tire and wheel combo is a one-piece unit. Any 'used' ones you find are
going to be 25 years old. Would I trust it as a spare after sitting a 1/4 of
a century? No.....
Mercedes uses that same blow-up/collapsible spare in the SLK. Same bolt
pattern as VW buses. Not cheap, though. Part # 203 400 54 00 and it has a
suggested list price of $200.
