Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

ok lets hope this is whats wrong....? i sure hope so..

was suggested by mark that i put a rag in the oil breather and see if it still had blowby and if not was suggested that it is the oil breather...

if it does(still blowby oil into peanut jar) then was still the P/L............

ok so drove same route just walla go(around the block and back) and stuffed rag into oil breather hole and laid oil breather to the side...&lt;of course before i drove around the block again...LOL

left peanut butter jar hooked up and drove round came back and wallll aaaaa so far i dont see any drips under the bus or any oil in the peanut butter jar..

soooooo i am guessing now that it is deffinetly somehow is still my oil breather clogged somehow,.,.,.

ive got the funny oil breather with the canister on top of it..? make a difference?

should i have one without the canister or just a new one period...?

thanks

btw still dont think i have my points just right but do have more power now so must of been the points? i must of got them a little closer?hmmmm?(just for the power issue not the oil LOL)

peace and love

Chris
