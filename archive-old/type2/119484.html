&lt;&lt; This is one of the coolest accessories I've ever seen for a Vanagon: 
gauges, cupholders, even and a fan!

It looks like a custom one off but I'm not certain. Can anyone with 
fiberglass experience give an idea of how much work it would take to create something 
like this for the baywindow?

 &gt;&gt;

The fiberglass work would be the least of it...What's hard would be making
the &quot;buck&quot;...Essentially, you'd hafta make one -a male- to have something
to use as a form...
&lt;&lt;  www.motorbooks_dot_com  &gt;&gt;
has quite a few how-to books on fiberglass (and lots of other auto-related
topics), that can give you a better idea as to the techniques involved... ;-)
