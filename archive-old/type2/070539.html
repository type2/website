Subject: Westy curtains again
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

    Realizing that this has been discussed at length in years past, I would 
love to chat up anyone who has SUCCESSFULLY re-dyed their late-'70's 
curtains.  There were varying opinions on types of dyes and whether this 
fabric will even take a dye.  Anyone actually tried it?  Thanks!
