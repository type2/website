Hi,

 Sure there is. I'm driving one today. They just didn't sell them in the
USA.
Unfortunately I don't know what the jet sizes are (sorry Dave).

 My guess would be that Mr Ireland isn't from the US.

 While most of the contributors to this list are American it is

do you any favours...

Cheers,
        W.
