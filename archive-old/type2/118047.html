&lt;&lt; As a test one time we punctured the oil filter on an otherwise good Fiat 
1600cc DOHC engine and held the tach to 4K rpms. The engine lasted about 15 
seconds before it began to seize, 22 seconds or so before it lost power and 
30 seconds before it seized hard and stalled. No amount of gas would make 
it overcome the seizing bearings. If you figure it had about a 75 HP engine 
then it took more than 75 HP to turn the seizing crankshaft.

Jeez...If only you guys had added a can of the &quot;infommercial oil&quot; that 
engine'd
still be running, right...?-)
