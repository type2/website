Whenever I'm faced with this problem, I get help from someone with an impact
wrench.  I'm tempted to buy one of my own, as I already have the compressor.

Hi Volks,
Just venting a bit ;0)
Prelude:  Driving down Rt 1 in PA outside Kennett Square in my '70
westy.  The girls and I are coming home from WV and visiting Mom for the
weekend.  Out of no where darts a deer.  Slam on the brakes and missed
the sucker by a hair.  Get composed and make sure everybody is ok.  Damn
blew out a brake cylinder.  Limp the bus to a Mobil/ mart and call the
folks to come and get us.  Luckily we were only 25 minutes away.
The next day after an exam review, I go to see if I can fix the bus and
get it home.  The nut came off fine, installed the cylinder and new
brakes, but of course the was a snag!  The adjusting star's bolt froze
up.  Went to get that undone and came back to finish the wheel.  Had
some problems getting the drum over the pads.  I forgot to loosen the
E-brake ( I realized this after an half hour of struggling and
scratching my head). Got the bus home safely.  No school today so I
thought I'd replace the other side.  I blocked the wheels and WD-40 the
nut. Got my cheater pipe out and proceeded to attempt breaking the nut.
I bent a 3/4 inch breaker bar!  I was persistent but came out on the
losing side.  Any suggestions?
