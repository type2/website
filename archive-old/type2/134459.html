Subject: Re: [T2] Winter progress

Thanks Dave!
I also rammed a vacuum tube down the y-tube, but all I got was a bit of
sand. I didn't get as far down as the front, where you found more crud.
In my check, I found that air delivery was at:
1)fan housing (thank god)
2)after heat exchanger
3)after plastic accordion tubes
4)finally, and weakly, at foot vents
I found a frozen cable on the driver's side and broke it trying to free it
up. Now it's zip tied fully open. I am hopeful in sealing all of the mating
surfaces next week --- when 65 degree weather will let me work outside! :-)
Is hi temp gasket sealant ok? Not that it's exactly high temperature at the
vent....
I also read a wonderful page at shagadelic_dot_org (thanks to Mark Hineline for
the great posting!) that describes Bus heat and how to make it work for you.
I look forward to getting some decent heat in the near future!
Thanks to all for sharing your good advice.
