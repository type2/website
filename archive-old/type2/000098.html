Hi - 
Mine have part number 043 101 375H and use spark plug W8CC instead of W8AC. I 
expect the longer reach takes the heat a bit further down. The H should 
indicate they are for CHT sensor but I don't see this. I do not expect the 
length of spark plug will be a problem for starting but I have no experience 
on this. The place I bought the heads said you could use the shorter plug but 
advised to go for the longer reach. It was also stamped on the box that the 
heads came in from VW mexico so why should I argue !!. 
Does your head have the smaller valve diameter? I'd be interested to know how 
it runs... when you are up and away again. I've yet to finish the swap since 
I'm doing other jobs with the engine out.... petrol tank etc
