Subject: Re: Brake drum saga continues...

Hi,

To update...

Yesterday, we found(!) and purchased a nice five-arm puller (added fifth
arm). We started pulling and out flung a bolt with a puller arm. Decided
that we need longer bolts so more than just a couple of threads are
pulling...

Today we visited five stores...one of them twice. Turned down some longer
14mm wheel bolts at **$9** each and bought some lug bolts from Pep Boys for
less than $2. You should have seen us kneeling on the floor digging
frantically through a drawer for the five bolts we needed... we almost
pulled this giant metal cabinet down on ourselves trying to pull out the
drawers. What has our bus done to us?!?

Pulled on the drum using the long lug bolts which we knew were going to be
very difficult to screw in (vice grips). During the long drawn out pulling,
we were wondering if someone was going to find us dead lying there in the
snow with puller arms and lug bolts imbedded in our skulls. The tension on
that drum was incredible.  Scary. The heavy duty kick butt PULLER started to
give! The threads were pinching. We banged and banged (not tapping
anymore)... used a heat gun... banged... pulled some more. Gave up before we
damaged the puller. Didn't help that the coldest place in the entire United
States today was here in New York although more north of us. Even Alaska was
warmer.

The drum has not moved. We have concluded that the PO NEVER did the rear
brakes in this bus' 30+ years in existance!!! Jude has 50+K miles on her..
hardly any miles at all since the early eighties, so it's not TOTALLY
ridiculous to believe they've never been done... the more we see on this bus
the more it seems quite possible actually.  *sigh*

We were going to start cutting tomorrow but after reading the advice I
received, we're going to keep trying. Will most likely need a new brake drum
anyway, but cutting sounds like a b***h of a job. I should mention that the
axle nut was easily removed... just a little more than hand tightened so the
advice I received to drive around with it a few threads loose, well, it has
pretty much already been done when the PO drove it up onto the trailer and
the during the test drive prior to purchase. We're also concerned about the
bearings so not sure we'll try that method or not. We'll also be utilizing
the other advice we received and tomorrow we will be putting a blow torch to
it most likely.

I had a great dream last night that we got the brake drum off. I'm dead
serious. When I looked under it in the dream, it was all new and shiney. I
think my dream was trying to tell me that the brakes have never seen the
light of day outside of the factory... I am going insane...


Still frozen just like the brake drum,
Jen :-)
