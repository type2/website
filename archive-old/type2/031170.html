&gt; BTW, I'm not familiar with newer than 79 buses.  What year did they start j-jet 
&gt; FI?
&gt; 
As far as I know there is no such thing as J-jet.

Air-cooled Vanagons used L-Jet.  Maybe you are thinking of K-Jet (the
continuous injection system) but that was never used on Buses, though it
was used on other VWs such as Rabbits.
