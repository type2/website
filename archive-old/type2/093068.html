Jay,

See the &quot;W&quot; on the right carb body?  Those are Weber carbs.  Not stock on 
any bus that I know of.  The fuel pump is a Facet and while it will work 
okay, you should get it out of the engine compartment where any leak could 
potentially throw fuel on the distributor.  You could also do as Chris 
suggests and get a quieter rotary pump - it's on my list of things to do 
also as I currently run the Facet.  You do need a pump - gravity feed is 
only for emergencies and wouldn't work unless your tank was very full as 
the level would be below that of the carbs.

You might be able to rig up the '74 air cleaner to work with those carbs, 
but I doubt it would be pretty.  You need something though - the engine 
won't last long unfiltered.

You are missing the seal on the alternator that covers the adjusting bolt, 
and the one that the dipstick tube goes through (but at least that one is 
sealed with silicone).  Overall the engine looks decent - nice and dry.
