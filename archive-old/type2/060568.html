It is entitled &quot;VOLKSWAGEN TRANSPORTER OWNERS HANDBOOK&quot; revised edition (Fifth
Printing August 1971). 

I no longer use it and am offering it to the list (for a fair price) before it
goes to Ebay

It originally sold for $5.00, but I would like a fair offer. Please no &quot;agents
of fortune&quot; please... last time I offered an item for sale (my foot stool to
my 1971) a party offered me $10.00 plus shipping... what a buddy ! ! !
Needless to say I still have the foot stool.
