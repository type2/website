Subject: 71 vs 78 Westy (&quot;best bus&quot;)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Quoth Ron Salmon: &gt;&gt;if you are looking for a Westy, you also get a very
nice camper layout, in my opinion much more ergonomically designed than the
pre-76 setup and very similar to the layout used to this day in Vanagons
and Eurovans.&lt;&lt;
  Ron, it's ironical that the more powerful later Westies carry fewer
people (safely)....in defense of my WELL used 71 bus rotting in the woods,
the 71 layout at least let me carry 7 people total and play host to seating
5 around the flip up table- 2 in the rear-facing seat with the stool next
to it (and a flip back I added for back comfort) and 3 in the rear
seat..._dot_can the later Westy tout that?   Back in the 70's we were a real
bus, carrying (for pay) 5 students from the Syracuse/Cornell area down to
the Philly area every weekend!  I remember them playing cards around the
table back there....
     Yes my current 78 Deluxe has more poop, storage space and stove and
yes you can now carry large objects in thru the sliding door without
hitting a cabinet- but I really miss the ability to carry 7 people!   This
is why I've yanked the rear seat and frig and put in a 74 Westy rear
seat...now I can seat 4 facing each other back there! (5 if you count the
guy sitting on the Stool against the door when parked!)
