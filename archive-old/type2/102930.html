Subject: Long Mirror (Posted after searching the archives!)

First, my thanks to Andy for his &quot;subtle&quot; hint to check the archives. :O^

[grin]

I was curious about the &quot;long mirror&quot; thing, and after checking the archives
I discovered the following and had a few questions:

1. There are three sizes of interior mirror available.  Same mirror, but the
length of the stalk is different.

2. The long stem mirror improves the rear visibility as it allows the driver
to look back down the road at length, rather than down onto the road
directly behind the bus.

3. They may not fit in some early buses.

Questions:

1. My bus' mirror stem is about 3.5&quot; (approx. 89mm) from the forward-facing
edge of the mounting flange to where the ball enters the mirror itself.  Is
this the large-sized stem, or one of the smaller ones?

2. (After learning from the archive how to...) I removed my mirror to look
it over, and noticed that the collar that accepts the ball seems to be
deteriorating.  While I understand that it would be easier just to replace
the entire assembly, is it possible to disassemble the mirror for repairs
without damaging the glass itself?  If so, how; and has anyone here
tried/done this?

3. What prevents the long stem from being installed in some buses?

Thanks for the help!
