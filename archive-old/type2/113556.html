&gt;OK, I imagine this to be without opening up the heads; so if my assumption

Assuptions waste time/money.

&gt;Could you pull the 1.8 heads off a '75 FI engine and bolt them to a 2.0 
&gt;'76 FI engine??

Not and save any money you can't. Stock is a much cheaper fix in the long 
haul. It's bolt on simple and no worries if you do it right. Much easier to 
get good results with, in order of preference, NEW stock heads and valves, 
stock heads rebuilt with new valves and guides.

Even so, with a used head you can't be sure what you got without verifying 
what it is. Spec out fully any used head before you begin to think that it 
is usable or not. The alternative is slap it on there and see what happens. 
In other words, and experiment based upon assumption that it will all turn 
out cheaper than straight stock successe.
