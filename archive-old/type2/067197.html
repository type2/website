Subject: Re: Clutch adjustment on a '74

Just a note on a tool I made to assist in clutch adjusting.
Take a 3 inch section of tube slightly bigger than the hub section of 
the wing nut.  Cut a pair of slots in end of tube to go over wings of 
nut.  Place other end over square business end of a socket extension.
Deform tube to match square shape (beat it with a hammer!) Viola, you 
have a wing nut adjuster that can be used with a long extension or 
speed wrench!  Just need to bend the tin slightly to allow access to 
wing nut.  I built this for my '67 Squareback and it worked well on 
my '76 bus too.  One of those tools I don't use anymore, (hydraulics 
in the '80) but still in my toolbox, JIC.
