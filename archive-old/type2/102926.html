Subject: Re: [T2] pulling crank gear

I've rebuilt a couple of Vanagon engines, and I don't have a gear puller.
The crankshaft timing gear can be removed by heating it with a propane
torch - go 'round and 'round the gear with the torch to get even heat
distribution - and, using a pair of heavy gloves, pull the gear off by hand.

&gt; From: &quot;Charles Claassen&quot; &lt;charlesclaassen_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I've been slowly disassembling a 2 liter engine in my spare time, and
&gt; right now I'm working on the crank.  Last night I pulled the fan hub,
&gt; removed the circlip, and the brass gear just pulled right off with my
&gt; hands.
&gt; The spacer came off easy, but I couldn't budge the last large gear.  My
&gt; question is this ---  since I don't really want to take it to a shop to
&gt; have it hydraulically pressed off, what are my options as far as gear
&gt; pullers go?
