Hello listees,

I have been reading George Lyle's report on how he spent his summer vacation
and it brings to my mind a question that has been lingering there.  I too have
just recently returned from a vacation going from Oklahoma to Colorado,
Wyoming and back through Nebraska and Kansas.  Unfortunately, not in my bus.

My question is, &quot;What, if anything needs to be done to a bus (carburated
1600DP) when traveling up in the mountains?&quot;  George relates to crossing the
continental divide going from 3500 feet up to 9000 feet and back down.  Did
you have to change timing or anything like that to get it to run right?
Modern cars with their fuel injection and computer controlled ignition don't
seem to have any problems (other than being a bit down on power).  I remember
in the &quot;old days&quot; that you would have to do something like rejet the carb and
change the timing to get it to run good.

I would eventually like to take my bus up through the mountains of Colorado
and Wyoming and would appreciate any input the list can provide.  TIA
