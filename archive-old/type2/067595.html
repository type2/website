Subject: Gas tank size?

I've got a '69 Westy and I can't figure out exactly how big the gas tank is.
The PO told me around 10.something gallons, which I know is wrong and
Bentley says it is 15.something gallons, but I don't think it is that big.
When my fuel gauge reaches the &quot;R&quot; at the bottom, how much is left in the
tank?  I filled up the other day when the gauge was just above the &quot;R&quot; and
it took 11.5 gallons.

TIA
'69 Westy
