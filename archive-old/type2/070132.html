I goofed.  I said in my little post about aircraft instruments that
gyroscopes spun at 20,000 rotations per second.  They don't.  Fast ones run
20K per minute.  Slow ones go not much slower than 12K.  That's still
getting right along and the air-driven ones stay pretty cool.  So my real
position (this time) is that VW engine heat does indeed come from the
burning stuff in there.
Sorry.  I'll proofread the next post mor carefully.
