Some of you may remember that I removed a functioning BA6 a couple of months
ago, this was done in a hurry, but I marked most bits &amp; got a complete
system, except for the duct from the re-circulating fan back into the body.
I now have some questions that need answers ASAP as I am fitting the BA6 at
the moment.

1.
I was very careful not to damage any cables, but I have 2 cut wires in the
set to the coil I think they were 2 grounded wires under the coil, 1 brown &amp;
1 red. Is this correct?

2.
My bus was a panel van, so I don't have the 'y' piece just in front of the
BA6, mine goes straight through. What can I do with the temp sensor? I do
have it &amp; the 'y' piece, but I don't want to fit it as a 'y' is of no use to
me. Can I just make a hole &amp; seal it in?

3.
I am replacing my existing heat exchangers &amp; have had to mount the BA6 on
DIY brackets (still using the rubber mounts), I am also not using the
re-circulating fan from the system as I have no air to re- circulate,
instead I intend to use a 12v in-line fan. I cannot see any problem as the
loom only supplies a positive feed, the plug neutral going straight to
ground. I assume that a fan is required to ensure a constant flow of air
through the heater. Does any-one see any snags?

4.
Does any-one know the flow rate of the re-circulating fan, so that I can get
a match, given that the OEM one is a 'hamster wheel' type &amp; I will be
fitting a propeller type.

5.
Given that using a 'hybrid' booster fan, instead of the re-circulating fan
is not a problem. I will have a good re-circulating fan, rubber boot &amp;
ducting going spare, if any UK list members have a use for one.

Sorry to all you non auxiliary heater bussers for the lenght.
