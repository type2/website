&gt;Bob,
&gt;I hope this isn't too stupid of a question, but is the engine tin needed 
&gt;because the original
&gt;engine was a single port or why?
=========================&gt;
The original 1972 bus engine was not a &quot;type 1&quot; engine.
1972 was the start of the VW strive for more engine horsepower with the 
&quot;pancakes&quot;.

What is shown here is the almost impossible to get tin that trims out a 
type 1 engine into a bus that originally came with the type 2 engine.

My cousin has a 1600DP engine in his 1972 engine compartment.

Type 1 engines were last made available in American sold buses in 1971,
with the 1600DP being the last type 1 engine configuration installed as out 
of factory issue.

The type 1 engines were continued for a bit longer in Europe, and later 
year buses over there  would have had this unique tin in the engine 
compartment so as to properly mount and cool same.

This is some of that &quot;unique&quot; European tin.

Now, my cousin will be able to have his cake, and eat it, too.
A 1600DP engine in a later year design bus with some of the so-called 
improvements that were included in the 1972 design body.
