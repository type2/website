Hi everyone. It's Friday and I'm going on vacation. I'll be heading into BC,
Canada to Vancover Island. We'll be heading North to Cambell River then West
over the mountains to Gold River, then North again to Tahsas(sp) for some
really excellent salmon fishing. I'll let you know how it went when I get
back. It'll be quite a trip!
