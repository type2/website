List, 
This mail goes to type2_at_type2_dot_com and shows up on the eGroups site as part of 
the eGroups &quot;type2&quot; mailing list. 
This means (if my limited understanding serves correctly) that all of us, as 
type2 listmembers can use the egroups chatroom at 
http://www.egroups_dot_com/ChatPage?listName=type2 

this chatroom cuts across your network firewall at work and may be useful to 
those of us that can't dwnld an irc client at work. 

Just thought i'd say this - could be something u all already know... 

Admins, if i'm talking about something here that only makes sense to me, 
please let me know... 

Thanx, 
Clark Gordon 
Morehead, Ky. US 

In front of a T1 9am to 8pm EST sun-wed most weeks.
