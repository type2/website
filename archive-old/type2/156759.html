1. It will probably hold 500 pounds on a genuine Class III hitch on a
Suburban, but that sort of load will tear the hitch right off a bus,
unless you have a beefy custom hitch that extends forward along the
&quot;frame&quot; rails.  You will also have terminal sag with that much load on the
rear..

2. Anything you carry on the platform will get _dirty_!  An amazing amount
of debris gets kicked up behind a vehicle in motion.  I found this out
with my Dad's hitch-mounted wheelchair carrier.  We finally made a
tightly-fitting cover for the wheelchair so it would be presentable after
a 100 mile highway trip.
