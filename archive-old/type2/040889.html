Subject: fuel tank needed

Hi all,
          Just dropped the fuel tank out of my friends 77 bus due to clogged 
fuel tank. (supply and returned is plugged).  Looking inside the tank , there 
is mass contamination, major rust.  ;(  so... my question to the list is, 
where is the best/cheapest place to buy a new or used/reconditioned fuel tank?

thanks,
mike green (key west fl)
 ps:  we did not drop the engine to pull the tank.  It was tight, but not to 
bad of a job.
