Subject: [T2] rear bumpers

Hello all
I have a 72 westy which I need a rear bumper for.  I
have posted a couple of times on the list but am
having a hard time coming up with anything.  From what
I understand these are becoming rare.  Most of the
boneyards in my area(Wisconsin) have just laughed at
me when I have inquired about it.

Does anyone on the list know if the 71's used the same
bumper as my 72?  I have found one from a guy in
Georgia who is willing to sell.  This bus isn't quite
stock, seeing as I have replaced the original motor
with an upright fan, I would like to keep the exterior
as original as possible.

Help!?
Thanks
Kurt and Julie
