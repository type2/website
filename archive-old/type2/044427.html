Subject:  [T2] 79 gas tank removal

&gt;Is there any way to remove the gas tank in a 79
bus without having to pull
&gt;the engine?

I support the technique mentioned below.
I also have a 79 westy FI.  The tank can be
removed. You may have to
pull with all your mite to get it out. I'd like to
add that you should
pay close attention to the 2 male fule line tubes
welded to the tank.
Whilst pulling they may break off.  Also, rotate
the tank and exit the
left(drivers)side of the opening.

Yes I have done this - we are talking about the
type 4 engine aren't we?

Getting the panel off for access to the tank is
quite easy. I don't know
what you have to remove with FI but getting the
carbs off is pretty simple.
If that's all you want then you can be in in about
30 minutes.

To actually remove the tank you'll have to get at
the straps which hold it
in place. This was the hardest bit as the nuts are
underneath and the heater
flaps are in the way. Get a long nose 13 mm
socket.

You'll need to remove a few other items in the
engine compartment to pull
the tank right out but it took me about 3 hours in
and out if I remember
rightly
