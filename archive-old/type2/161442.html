Subject: Anyone know a source for a stock residual valve?

Hi everyone,

I'm new to bus ownership (and to the list), and just bought a '71 camper about
3 weeks ago.

I'm still working through some carburetor problems/replacements (yes,
multiple) that are driving me nuts, but I'm more concerned about the brakes!
The residual brake valve leaks from the plug on the top side of the unit and
apparently the part is discontinued.  Anyone have any idea where I could get
an OEM style replacement for it?  The places I've called no longer have
anything but a generic replacement that requires some modification to the
lines and some tweaking to get the pressure right.

I'm really excited to get this loaf on the road, so any help would be
appreciated.  I'm thinking maybe I can just use some JB-weld on the plug, but
I'd rather just find a new one if possible.

Thanks,

John
