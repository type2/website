Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor

&gt; That magazine isn't worth saving. I prefer Samba remain non-commercial.


I agree, but was just looking for an &quot;out&quot; for the mag. I don't read
either of them, don't like them. They are generally useless for the
average owner except to show what our vehicles COULD look like if we
had years and thousands of dollars to dump into them. Like Playboy for
cars. ;-)

No, my concern is what the magazines represent. If there is a market
for 2 magazines, it tells me that there is still a large viable
community for the magazines to target. If the magazines die, that
makes me think the community has shrunk to the point where it's
becoming nearly invisible to the world at large. This *WILL* affect
parts, support, etc.

If the manufacturers of our parts perceive that there is no market for
their parts, (and no magazine to advertise in), odds are good they
will move away from this market into something they perceive as
lucrative.

Perception is everything.

Irrational, maybe, but it should be a real concern.
