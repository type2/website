&gt; A total change in mindset besides driving.  It's relaxing once you accept
&gt; it or at least it was for me.

Hi James. Yeah...I noticed a difference the few times I drove it. I'm looking 
forward to getting it reliable and roadworthy...


&gt; I picked up a 78 bus in september and have 
&gt; been driving it quite a bit since my little winter beater of a car blew the
&gt; it's clutch.  It really enjoys this weather.

I haven't driven my bus much, yet. It really doesn't like the cold weather at 
all -- probably just needs a little tuning. Plus I get no heat. Some of the 
heating ducts are disconnected and the gas heater doesn't seem to be 
running... 


&gt; I am located in Saskatoon.  Where abouts are you in Alberta?

Lethbridge


&gt; The tin around the motor is a big deal since it's really needed to prevent
&gt; overheating. 

So I've learned. If I decide to keep this engine, I'll have to check into the 
fiberglass engine &quot;tin&quot; that Paulie posted 
(http://www.creativecarcraft_dot_com/notforbug.htm).


&gt; From what I hear they all leak oil to some degree. How much 
&gt; does yours go through?  Where does it appear to leak?

It's not a whole bunch. I get what looks like a teaspoon sized blob after the 
engine runs for a bit and it looks like it might be coming from the back near 
the tranny. Maybe it's the rear main seal?
