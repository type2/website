There was a magazine a couple of years ago called VW Custom and 
Classic.  They reviewed all of the available ignitions.  There are all 
basically the same.  It comes down to how much you want to spend.  I went 
with their top recommended pick which was electromotive-inc_dot_com.  Most of 
the faithfuls on this list disagree with my choice due to its high costs; 
however I can honestly say it is the most awesome system I have seen.  Most 
of the listees prefer the $20-$100 drop ins that require a 
distributor.  and a normal coil.
&quot;Speed and performance cost money, How fast do you want to go?&quot;

&gt;Hi Loafers

&gt;I just started on this list and, I have to say, the mail reads like
&gt;poetry to a fellow loafer. I guess if you drive an old bus, its kinda
&gt;like a mail filter. All the flamers and disser's have been weeded out.
&gt;Only ones left are the people who (try to) understand man and machine.
&gt;
&gt;I want to know if there is a roundup and review of aftermarket
&gt;electronic ignitions, CDIs for VWz. I have a stock dizzy (dual vacuum)
&gt;in my 72 bus and a 009 in my 69 Ghia. Are there any websites that give
&gt;comparisons, gripes, tips, dos/don'ts and such stuff?
