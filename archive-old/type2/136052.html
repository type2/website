Subject: Re: [T2] Definitely a Friday topic

Another one that seems to catch the spirit of the VW bus is &quot;Steam Powered
Aero Plane&quot; by John Hartford.  My favorite version is by The Grateful
Dudes (not the Dead!)

---------------------------------

Well I never went away on a Steam Powered Aero plane.
Well I went and stayed and damn near didn't come back again.
Didn't go very fast on a steam powered aero plane,
Oh the wheel went around, up and down, and inside and then back again.


Sittin' in a 747 just watching them clouds roll by,
Can't tell if it's sunshine or if it's rain.
Rather be sittin' in a deck chair high above Kansas City,
On a genuine old fashioned steam powered aero plane.


Well I'd like to be a pilot on a steam powered aero plane.
Well I'd pull that pilot wheel around and then back again.
Well, I'll wear a blue hat, yeah, that says Steam Powered Aero plane
With letters that go around the rim and then back again.
