Subject: [T2] Farmington, NC  IVWA show canceled

I just spoke with Cynthia Tate and the Dec. 10 at Farmington, NC has been
canceled.

 IVWA will be setting its 2001 schedule in the next week and will be redoing
their website. I mentioned the EveryBus 2001 dates and she will be letting
me know when the IVWA spring show falls (no pun there :)
