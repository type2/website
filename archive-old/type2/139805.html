&gt; Thanks for your input.  When I bought my bus a couple of months ago it had
&gt; car tires on it and I felt that I needed to get them off as soon as possible
&gt; for safety reasons.
&gt;
&gt; One option at the time was to buy Michelins at $130 per tire... a little to
&gt; rich for me at the time.

WHERE did you still find the michelin bus tires,  I paid about that much
for mine about 5 years ago and was told they are no longer avaliable.
