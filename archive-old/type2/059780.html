Hey Y'all,
   I am new to the type 2 list but am very active on the Vintage VW 
list. I just recently purchest two Busses. The first is a 69 7 pass and 
the second is a 74 7 pass. 
   The 69 is the one I wanted but I had to buy them both to get the one. 
The 74 is for sale if anyone is interested. It has a type IV still and 
has dual carbs (Webers I think). It also has a factory sunroof. I would 
be happy to give more info if anyone is interested, it will go for 
$500-600.
    The question I have is this, can the disk brakes from a later bus 
(7?-79) be retrofitted to an earlier bus? I know that the bolt pattern 
will be different and have to be changed somehow. 
    Also I don't want to slam the bus, but have seen some that have been 
lowered a little and like the look. Is the torsion bar front end like 
the Bug and require adjusters or splined like the type III?
   The 74 has the booster fan (is this what its called?) in the engine 
bay, would this be good to add to the 69? Or are the dog house fans 
strong enough?
    I've had type I's and III's for many years now but I have three 
children and they just don't fit in the Bug so I finally talked my wife 
into leting me get my dream VW, a 69 transporter. Please bear with me as 
I learn the different names and quirks of these wonderful vehicles.
