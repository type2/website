Subject: Questions for Looking over before trip

Hey ladies and fellas-

I am planning my first trip with my bus (beyond an hour) and Im curious what I
should check/plan for/troubleshoot before heading out.  I am thinking about
trying to get to Kampers near Knobles (name right?) first, since thats an hour
away, but in mid September my girl and I want to head to Niagra Falls.  Thats
about 6 to 8 hours from Princeton I figure, and I dont want anything fatal
happening in between.

Oil temp has never been above 224 (65mph for a half hour or more)...is this
ok?  Im used to water cooled smallblocks, so I dont know whats a good range
here.  Ive only put about 300 miles on the rebuild (did it myself so Im
scared).  I dropped a halfshaft a week ago, found out the hard way that I
didnt double check the tightness after initial assembly.  That was a fun
roadside fix.  But other than that, any recommendations on things to check on
before I go?  I got about a month, and 2 nickles that Im rubbing together.
Thanks a lot guys and gals.

-ToM
