Subject: Missing wire to flasher switch and weird 

Wise Listees, 

I'm having problems with the turn signals and
emergency flashers also.  They light up, but
don't flash.  I suspect the relay and have now
pulled it.  It was full of water!  Gotta get that
windshield seal/rust problem fixed.  

Other than replacing the relay, what should I do?
 Where will I find these common grounds?  FLAPs
flasher relay OK?  

Thanks in advance.
