Subject: Big Sur bailing wire and duct tape!

Well, our maiden voyage in &quot;Betty Blue&quot; the westy, went off pretty well, but
the trip was short.  Went to Big Sur via Hollister, Monterey, Carmel by the
Coast,  and down the Hwy1 via Big Sur to San Simeon, Cambria then home via 101
to 198 to 33 (thru Coalinga) to 145 (back to Madera).  There isn't a lot of
power on the hills which requires downshifting to 3rd.  For the most part, it
holds the speed limit quite well.

Mechanically, everything went smoothly except one little hiccup on the 101
just after dark . . .the throttle cable broke!!!  Of all things!!  First time
that's ever happened to me on any car.  The break was right near the throttle
body in the engine compartment.  So, with about 5 inches of bailing wire, duct
tape and a pair of plyers we were back in business in about 15 minutes.  Got
back on the road.  I didn't expect &quot;the patch job&quot; to hold up without stopping
again, but it held for the remaining 150 or so miles.  Who the heck wooda
thought that the cable from your gas pedal would ever break!!!?!?!  Wasn't
something I even looked at carefully in determining its roadworthiness.  So,
I'm off and searching for a new throttle cable this week.

So, next time your tooling around in the engine compartment, maybe look
closely and with good light at end of your throttle cable where it connects to
the 1 inch or so rod (the connecting piece).  And like I say, a little piece
of bailing wire, 2 inches of duct tape, and pliers will do the emergency fix
on the side of the road.

To any of the 8-10 westys we saw on the trip this weekend (and are on this
list) . . .thanks for the honks and waves . . .added a little extra fun to the
trip!

Brad
