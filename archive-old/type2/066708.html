Here's the post I think you're all refering to. . .

I've got one from a company in England called Propex that Chris Gibbs 
mentioned
a few weeks back.  It's real small, 14&quot; x 6&quot; x 4.52&quot;.  I've been 
wanting this
kind of heater for a few years now.  It runs about $500 all told.  It 
fits
unders the bench seat, or it can go in one of the cabinets I suppose.  
Chris
said he spliced his in with a pipe running under the cabinets and 
behind the
fridge.  That's how I'll do mine.  

It's a small heater/blower with the intake and exhaust through holes in 
the
bottom of the camper.  The heat ducts go through the bench seat fire 
wall.

If you want more details, email me or Chris Gibbs.

Here's the companies address and phone:

PROPEX (UK) LTD
CAMPION HOUSE
LINCOLN ROAD
LEADENHAM
LINCOLN, LN5 OPE
ENGLAND

Tel. 011-44 (1703) 528555

The phone number is correct as I've been corresponding with them
lately.

Cheers!

&gt; &gt; I can't seem to find the original post about a possible group 
&gt; pruchase of
&gt; &gt; Propex furnaces. A search of the archives was fruitless. Can someone 
&gt; please send me t

&gt; Ya I searched for this too.  If someone is suggesting that the company 
&gt; might give us a 
&gt; deal if 10 or so of us ordered at once then I would probably be 
&gt; interested.
