I wouldn't believe anything I heard 'on the radio'. LA pollution
levels have been visibly increasing for the five yrs I lived
there (90-95). They always have said that. Of course it was attri-
buted to their oxy gas. Wonder what it's doing to our mileage and
engines.

If they cared about the air in LA, they'd have built mass transit
a long time ago, rather than tearing the existing mass transit
system up.
