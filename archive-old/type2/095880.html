Volks,

I am tired of throwing money away on pep boys beauty rings.they are made =
of steel with a cheapie chrome finish that starts rusting almost =
immediately.on the front wheels the brake dust really discolors them. =20

Any one find any good ones made out of stainless or aluminum?  I think =
that would solve my problem.

TIA
Adam P
