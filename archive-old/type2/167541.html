&gt; no I  haven't and it is #1 causing the problem not #3  which was fine
&gt; before  I started, I had a dropped seat on both 3 &amp;4 both intake too. so
&gt; while  engine was out and stripped &quot;Why not do both heads&quot; (outsmart self)
&gt; if I  cannot get a decent seal with a gasket installed I will reinstall the
&gt; old  head.
&gt;
&gt; hello Bob   So you didn't use a head gasket and it sounds like  you didn't
&gt; lap the clylinders into the head also. IF you had you should have  seen where
&gt; they were lapped together.  Now just installing a head gasket  under one side of
&gt; the heads seems like it would cause the CR to be  different.  later  mark d

doubt if that small CR difference will cause any significant problems, it
was like that (unknowingly) for about the past 5-6 years anyway. when I
took it down. 3&amp;4 didn't have gasket.  1&amp;2 did. so effectively it will be
no change than the way it was.  (I replaced 3&amp;4 some years ago and didn't
put a gasket in not realizing that 1&amp;2 had it)

Bob
