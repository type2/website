Subject: Re: [T2] no start after lubing distrib. with WD40

&gt; &quot;'Cause it's waaay too small. You get hurt drivin' this...What you want is
&gt; a
&gt; Buick...That way you have an accident, it's like it's in another country!&quot;
&gt;

I sure felt that way when the kid in the Honda Accord tried to change lanes
into the side of my VW.  There was a fairly loud sound, but the Bus didn't
shake even a little.

Passenger: &quot;What was that sound?&quot;
Me: &quot;I think a car just hit us.&quot;
Passenger: &quot;Seriously?&quot;
