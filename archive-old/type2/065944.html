&gt; Until I get around to sanding down the entire vehicle for it's eventual 
&gt; complete repainting, I'd like to take care of the small (dime size and 
&gt; smaller) stone chips that have created little rust spots on various 
&gt; sections of the body. My intent is purely to create a stop gap measure to 
&gt; prevent rust from continuing it's incessant march. I realize this is not 
&gt; a long term cure.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that, here what I *think* I should do (comments invited):
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Wire wheel the affected area down to bare metal.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Feather sand the paint out to about an inch away from the bare metal.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Clean the area with some type of metal prep (don't know exactly what 
&gt; or which)

Do the painting IMMEADIATELY!!!!! Rust will set upon your bare metal even 
with metal prep like you will not BELIEVE!  

&gt; 
&gt; 4) Mask off area.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Spray with some kind of primer. It'd be much easier if this primer 
&gt; were in a spray can of sorts. If someone has a preferred brand I'd love 
&gt; to know which.

  6) Spray over the primer with some kind of paint. DO NOT LEAVE IT JUST 
PRIMER. Primer will absorb moisture from the air and hasten the rusting 
process you just worked so hard to stop.


&gt; 
&gt; Is that all? Am I missing something here?


CIAO!!!!
