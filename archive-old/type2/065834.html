Unfortunately, the powers that be don't give a damn about clean air.

In many cases it is illegal to retrofit catalytic converters on car not desgined for 
them.  The reasons make sense.  Many older vehicles are not equipped to hang the 
extremely hot running cats from the undercarriage and there is a fire danger.  The 
possibilities are minimized with the design of the VW engine and exhaust but if one 
were to retrofit and park the bus in an area of tall grass, a fire could result.

Were the government really concerned about clean air they would pass vehicles that run 
clean and fail those that do not.  A failure should mean that the vehicle can not be 
registered until it is made to run clean.

Under the present rules, modifications are illegal whether they actually make the 
vehicle run cleaner or not.  Logic would dictate that the tailpipe test would be the 
decider on passes or failures.  There is not a smog legal stand-alone electronic fuel 
injection setup available in the aftermarket and many electronic ignitions are illegal 
even though both would mean a cleaner burning vehicle.

An illegal vehicle running five times as clean as a legal, dirty vehicle should be 
burning fuel, while the dirty running vehicle should be cleaned up.

The revised system in California is controlled by one bureaucracy which was heavily 
lobbied by one company which is trying to take the smog testing out of the hands of 
individual shops and into the test centers which only it runs.  They make billions, 
more Californians are unemployed and the air is no cleaner.

Modifications to an engine--including cat retrofit--should only be illegal if the 
vehicle can not pass the standards of the test.

Sorry, I guess that was about $.03 worth.  Think!  Clean counts.  Logic should rule.
