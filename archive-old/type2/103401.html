Subject: T2 tire cover, white

I have a situation where I bought a T2 tire cover (molded, white) on eBay. The
seller is not really an eBayer, and he seems reluctant to ship, because my
winning bid was only $.50!! Well, I think he would do it, but I thought that
for both of us, it is not really worth it. I'm not sure what state he's in,
offhand, but is there anyone out there who would like to have one of these for
fifty cents, you pick up?
The cover is in fair condition.. could use a coat of paint to make it show
quality.. otherwise a utility item.
