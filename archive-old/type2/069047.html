Subject: '66 Transporter/Authentic Parts For Sale

A friend of my dad's has a '66 Transporter and lots of irreplacable parts
from the VW factory, still in the boxes with invoices, probably $9000 worth
in all. He is willing to make someone a big deal. We live in eastern Ohio.

Reply directly to my email address and I'll put you in touch with him.
