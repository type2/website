&gt; hurry or head out to the quarry if you have the time. After filling up (no

I forgot about gas.  Do fill up in Ely and again in Austin and Fallon.
Don't look at the prices on the pump in Austin. They will depress you.
Gas is usually cheaper in Fallon than Reno.

  Take 50
&gt; toward but not to Austin, NV.  As you pass the various ranges to your
&gt; south in the Toiyabe National Forest (motto: Wrap it up, boys... we're
&gt; DONE!) at least one of the dirt roads on the left down the valleys leads
&gt; to a spot where you can pull over for the night and get up at 3AM, go out
&gt; for a break and NOT SEE AN ELECTRIC LIGHT!

You've described a lot of places in central Nevada!  I hadn't thought of
it, but this whole region is a amateur astronomer's dream.  No artificial
light and reasonably high altitude.  Until I moved to the Big City (tm) I
didn't know that most people didn't see the Milky Way every night!

&gt; If you choose to travel I-80....
&gt;
&gt; If you have to make it in one day this is probably the way to go.  You
&gt; waste the least possible time and hit the fewest grades although the one
&gt; into Reno/Trukee is still steep (that's what we call a &quot;euphemism&quot;, son).
&gt; Since it is Donner pass of course I suggest you bring plenty of food just
&gt; in case[1].  The one &quot;tourist attraction&quot; on that route is that you get to
&gt; stop for gas and whatever services you require in Battle Mountain, NV.
&gt; For the &quot;Official Tour Guide&quot; to Battle Mountain search Google with the
&gt; string &quot;battle mountain worst&quot; and read the top two hits.

Nevada doesn't get much good press!  :)  Luckily, these towns have a sense
of humor and don't worry too much.  Winnemucca and Battle Mountain have a
friendly rivalry for tourist visits and feature billboards advertising
such things as:

Winnemucca:  Paved Streets!

Battle Mountain:  Running Water!

Winnemucca:  Cruise the Humboldt! (with a picture of a cruise ship)

(the Humboldt river is a foot deep on a good day!)


If you decide on the I-80 route, you should stop off for a Basque dinner
either in Elko at the Star Hotel or at Winnemucca at the Winnemucca Hotel.
Reno has Louis' Basque Corner, but I prefer the more rustic places.  Take
your appetite!

If you really want to &quot;rough it&quot;  You can go to Tuscarora from Elko and
then cross a lot of the state on the gravel road over to Midas.  Be
prepared to fix and camp!
