Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't start... the very basics

Paulo,

With your engine, I would go back to basics...  presume nothing...

First, verify that you actually have spark...  pull the spark plugs out,
leave the spark plug wire attached to one of them, attach an alligator
clip between the base of that plug and the head.  Then, while someone else
cranks the engine, verify visually at the plug that it is actually
sparking.

Second, test the compression.  I know it is a new engine and you have
done this a dozen times, but do it again.  Check all 4 cylinders.

(remove distributor cap from distributor)

Third, check that the distributor drive is installed correctly.  Pop the
valve cover off the right side of the engine.  Have a friend rotate the
engine (clockwise) with a (big) socket on the crank pulley.  Watch the
rockers move.  As the intake valve valve closes on cylinder #1, yell
&quot;STOP&quot;.  Make sure that the rotor in the distributor is pointed, at least
vaguely, toward the point on the distributor cap where the wire to the #1
spark plug goes.

(re-install spark plugs at this point, leave cap off distributor)

Fourth, check your dwell.  Rotate the engine until the points rider is on
top of a lobe.  Insert a .16&quot; feeler gauge between the points... is it
close?  Adjust as necessary.

Note on dwell: Dwell meters are better than feeler gauges. If you have a
dwell meter, you can crank it and adjust them to 50 degrees without the
engine running.  If you have a digital VOM, set the gauge to DC volts and
try to get the reading as close to 6.67 volts as you can.

Fifth, rotate the engine to the 7.5 degree BTDC mark on the pulley,
verify that the rotor in the distributor is pointing at or near the point
where the #1 spark plug lead enters the distributor cap. Attach a test
lamp between ground and the coil lead where the wire from the distributor
enters the coil.  Rotate the engine back and forth.  The light should
blink on and off as you pass the mark.  If it does not, rotate the dist
until it does.

Sixth, disconnect the fuel line from the carburetor. Point it at a bottle
or paper cup.  Have someone crank the engine... make sure that the gas
pump is pumping gas.

(Re-install distributor cap)

If the gas pump is pumping, and the spark is sparking at something like
7.5 BTDC and 50 degrees dwell, and the compression is good, and it still
won't start, then try a shot of ether (starting fluid) down the carb
throat.  If it runs for a second, then quits... you have carb problems.

I am a fuel injection person and I can tell you the basic adjustments to
an FI system, but it has been too many years since I have adjusted a carb
so I leave that for those who know that system...  (feel free to jump in,
all you carbureted volks)
