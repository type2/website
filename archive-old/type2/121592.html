Subject: New Heads or Rebuild old

I finally pulled the passenger side head off of my 1600SP and sure enough 
one of the valves is bad (burnt valve), hence the 0 compression on the #1 
cyl.  So I'm happy the piston is OK, and I was ready to bring it to a 
machine shop when I notice that a new head with valve train for $99.99 
rebuilt, $129.99 new.  So, why would I install new valve when I can just 
slap on a new head?  My engine has 158,000 miles and has good compression 
on the other cylinders.

Of course, if I'm getting new heads I'll have to get a dual-port and slap 
on a set of Webers, but that's another story :-)
