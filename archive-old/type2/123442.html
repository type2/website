Subject: Re: [T2] type IV fan fell off

Hi Folks,

This problem you speak of -- is it particular to older T4 engines?  The fan 
on my '78 engine is held on by 3 bolts with 1/2&quot; (12.7mm) heads, and is not 
held on by one big nut.  Since more than one of you has mentioned the fan 
falling off, should I worry that mine might someday as well?

It sounds like something fairly easy to fix, but I'd like to avoid it 
happening in the first place...

Thanks!
