Subject: Dual Brake Circuit Warning Light (long, but important)

Volks,

Over the years we have had a couple threads on the little red light on
your dash with the &quot;B&quot; printed on it.  Because it has been a while, and
because I was recently asked about it, I wanted to go over the purpose and
meaning of it again.

That thing is called the &quot;Dual Brake Circuit Warning Light&quot;.  To save
typing from here out I am just gonna call it &quot;the light&quot;.  Its primary
purpose is to warn you that you are about to lose your brakes or that you
just did. The proper reaction to even a brief flash of this pup is th
*STOP DRIVING*!!!  I cannot emphasize this strongly enough.  If you keep
driving, you are risking your life and the lives of others on the road.

The way the light works is as follows.  In your master cylinder on all
VW's made since ~June of 1966, there is a primary piston and a secondary
piston.  In ASCII art (crude) they look like this:

                            feed to      feed to 
                            front        rear
                            brakes       brakes
                       _
                      | |     ||            ||
                      |  --------------------------
                      |--------------------------||
                        |----|     |------|      ||
pushrod (to pedal) =====|    |     |      |      ||
                        |----|     |------|      ||
                      |--------------------------||
                      |  --------------------------  
                      | | ^           ^
                       -  |           |
                        primary     Secondary
                        piston      piston

Not shown are two switches, both at the bottom, under the feed pipes
about where the piston arrows are. (remember this, as they are very
important)

When you press on the pedal, the force is transmitted from the pedal, thru
the primary piston, thru the brake fluid between the primary and secondary
pistons, thru the secondary piston, to the fluid in front of the secondary
piston.  The fluid between the pistons and the fluid in front of the
secondary piston is forced out of the master cylinder, to the wheels
where if forces the brake shoes/caliper pads against the drums/discs and
stops the car.

when you press on the pedal, and build up this pressure in the master
cylinder, it also forces the switches closed  *BOTH* switches... at the
same time!!  Now the light on your dash and your brake lights are
connected to those switches. If all goes well, and pressure builds in both
circuits at the same time and both switches close at the same time, then
the brake lights come on and the guy behind you puts on his brakes and all
is well with the world.  BUT.....

The light contains a little logic circuit called an &quot;and&quot; circuit.  Its
job is to sense the position of each of those switches.  If they are both
in the same position (both on or both off) then it is happy.  If one is on
and the other is off, then it is very unhappy and glows.  In logical terms
it is looking for &quot;A and B&quot;  or &quot;not A and not B&quot;, either one, just so
they are the same.

The reason for this is that if one of the switches closes and the other
does not, then you have pressure in one of your brake circuits, but not in
the other.  Usually the reason for this, at least the first few times, is
a little air in the system.  it take the system a microsecond or two to
compress the air in the one circuit and while that is happening, one
switch is open and the other is close, so the light flashes at you. The
reason there is air in the system is that you have a hole in your system
that is letting air in.  It is also letting brake fluid out.  This is
BAD!!!  If the hole is a pinhole leak in a metal line, as Ron found last
week, the next time you step on the brakes, the line may rupture and you
have suddenly lost more than half of your ability to stop.

It is not always this sever, but because it could be this severe, and I
want y'all *paranoid* about this... I am not going to tell you what the
less severe things may be.  If you check the system, you will find them
yourself.  And you *must* check the system!!!  NOW!!!

As a side note, the test for the &quot;B&quot; light varied thru the years.  VW used
three different test methods.  first, on some years and models, if you
press the &quot;B&quot; it lights up (bugs mostly); second, on some years, the light
comes on along with the alt light during cranking; third, on late bays,
the light comes on when the parking brake is engaged.
