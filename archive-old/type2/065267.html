That is true, but believe me, the engine isn't going to notice .002&quot; extra
valve lash, performance wise.  It will, however, let your engine live a
little longer if that valve starts to tighten up for whatever reason.
Maybe enough longer that you will find the problem and fix it before the
engine grenades itself.

This is one of those things that can get religious, so I don't expect to
change anyone's mind.  One solution is to go with hydraulic lifters, which
effectively have .000 lash at all times.  This is great for the engine as
long as the hydraulic lifters work like they are supposed to, but that's a
whole 'nuther can of worms, isn't it?

I went to hydraulic lifters, and so far I have no major complaints.  Of
course, now that I don't have to remove my valve covers anymore, they leak
like crazy.  Replaced the gaskets three times now and they still leak.
I'll lick the problem eventually, but at the moment it's giving me fits.

That's my daily zwei pfennig...
