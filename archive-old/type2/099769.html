&gt;What do you want 30-50 Amps for??? That would be 360 - 600 Watts. Even
&gt;if you go with 100 Watt high beams, 20 Amps should be plenty. The higher

Point taken, although with the 10 gauge wire I recommended you will have no trouble blowing a 30 amp fuse before the wire is damaged.  50 may be a bit high, I'll admit, but I still think it would work okay.
