Hi Bill.  I think Sunbrella is the best curtain material.  It never fades or 
rots out and blocks out more light when closed.  But it does require a 
different design.  The trick is to make the loop/hems that the rods go 
through much wider than the stock ones.  Instead of the stock 1&quot;, I used a 
2.5&quot; wide hem.  A 3&quot; or wider hem might even be better. This provides more 
room for the material to wrinkle up as you open them.  Even then, I have to 
hold them open with the little tie-down belts.  You also have to make them 
about a 1/2&quot; taller as they will pull up more when opened.   If you leave 
them held open the wrinkles will set in and it will get easier to open 
them--but then, they won't want to stay closed!  I use velcro to keep them 
shut.   Washing them will soften them up a little as the water proofing 
chemical will come out.  The fabric won't shrink, but if you used cotton 
thread the seams will.  Of course, use fabric softener.  If that doesn't 
work, you could always take them apart and sew on a strip at the top or 
bottom.  Sorry for the extra work, but the great thing is, once you get them 
right, they should last forever.  I'm very happy with mine.
Good luck,  Alan
