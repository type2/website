Hi Eric,

You have perfectly described the classic symptom of a displaced
vacuum hose.

Look there first.

Secondly, check to see if the fuel pump is running properly.


Happy trails,

&gt; Yesterday I took out my battery and replaced the battery tray
&gt; (tricky job).
&gt; Today I put the battery back in, hook everything back up, and no
&gt; start.
&gt;
&gt; My lights come on as they should. I turn the key and it sounds like it
&gt; starts but then it dies. If I get it to turn over and then hit the
&gt; accelerator, it stalls.
&gt;
&gt; It has to be related to something yesterday, since it had been
&gt; starting on
&gt; the 1st try before that.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Eric
