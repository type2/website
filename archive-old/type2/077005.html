&gt;Chris Mills says of No-Smoke Motor Oil Additives:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The stuff is as thick as honey and I figure it can't do good things that
&gt; &gt; relies on the oil to be thin enough to get into the tighter parts of the
&gt; &gt; engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just a band-aid for a real problem. More or less a waste of money too.
&gt;
&gt;It's The Unscrupulous Used Car Dealer's Best Friend, Chris. Dump a bottle or
&gt;two into the worst smoker and she looks like she's got a nice tight engine.
&gt;Slap you a &quot;As Is-No Warranty&quot; sign in the window and you have something to
&gt;point to when the worn-out engine finally lets go in three weeks. Yes, a
&gt;quick oil analysis will quickly show that No Smoke Motor Oil Additive is in
&gt;there, but anyone who'd buy a car with an engine full of Motor Honey isn't
&gt;going to know about oil analysis either.
&gt;--

Exactly.

I had a high mileage $150 CR-X when i was in the service and was travelling 
back and forth between VA and TN to see my girlfriend.

Didn't want to be adding oil ever gas stop.

Tried it - figured at $150 for the whole car I didn't have much to lose.

Like I said before it worked - for a while - but I think it may have led to 
more problems as the smoke volume SEEMED to increase quickly after the 
first couple of times.

Yes - it did lead to a sludge in the oil pan.

I kept the oil changed regularly. That was the best damn cheap car I ever 
owned. My buddy bought it from the base junkyard in Naples for $50. Did a 
tuneup and drove it for ~3 years. Sold it to me for what he had in it 
($150) and once stateside again I put another 20K miles on it (more or 
less). I never did anything to it either.

Traded it for a $1K Hyundai (yuck) that needed $100 of repairs. Sold that 
one too. Wish I found more deals like those.
