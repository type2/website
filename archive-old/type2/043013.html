Subject: vacuum leaks??

In Northern Virginia, there is a shop (across from Brown Honda on route 1, 
Alexandria VA) that has a setup that finds vacuum leaks.

Details I don't have, but from memory:  I contacted the equipment 
manufacturer a few years back, and I got a list of four shops in Virginia 
which bought their equipment.  Two shops in Northern Virginia, and I visited 
the one on route 1. the young man owner said his dad bought the system, he 
didn't get much use out of it, and he would be happy to power it up for $45 
labor.  Young man said it was most useful for carburated engines, and he 
said less useful for fuel injected engines.

Remember, yours truly is NOT technically competent, but if I was vexed with 
vacuum leaks, I would probably pay the $45 (or so) just to see the machine 
work...

Sorry for venting (so to speak), I am having a 'bad day at black rock' (the 
office).
