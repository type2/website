Subject: 72 Bus/Systemic Pressure/Question (longish)
Content-Disposition: inline

I got the ticket I'd been wishing for yesterday, $55 bucks - expired inspection.

I finished installing the back brakes (new cylinders, adjustors, screws,
hardware - old shoes) and was able to adjust them easily from the access holes
with a screwdriver.  I installed the brake servo, careful to obtain the proper
push rod measurement. Before installing the master cylinder I had to switch the
old brake fluid resevoir over from the old master cylinder. I was interupted by
a neighbor who indicated that he didn't want me to work at night. Yeah okay.

I didn't want to get into it with anyone, so I jacked down the bus and pushed it
down the street, to the other side of the street, out of sight from him,
rejacked it and began to remove the old reservoir unfortunately it was late by
this time and in my anxiousness to finish, missed dinner &amp; rest, but at the same
time gained a little resentment and all this combined to cause me to remove the
reservoir with too much force, breaking off one of the 2 plastic nipples which
feeds fluid into the Master Cylinder.

So due to systemic pressure the bus must get off the street by 8am, so I had to
bring it to the pay lot, which means I had to
get some sort of brakes to do that. I searched for a replacement reservoir and
found none. In desperation, [sounds like a trite phrase at this point]  I took a
fuel pump output brass fitting, sawed it in half, filed it down on one end,
widened the hole in the plastic reservoir slightly and lodged the brass fitting
into the reservoir. installed new base grommets between MC and Reservoir and for
good measure wrapped some mechanics wire around the entire assembly to hold the
resevoir tight against the MC.

Installed everything, filled the sytem with fluid and it pumped the brakes - it
didn't leak!.  At 2am couldn't find anyone on the streets willing to pump the
brake pedal for me to bleed the brakes, and don't have the self-bleeder kit, so
I cracked each bleeder in turn, and pumped the brakes until fluid came out

Packed up, caught a couple hours of sleep and at 530 drove over to the pay per
day lot which is also an inspection station and repair shop.
Unfortunately, on the way over I still had absolutely no pedal. As I pump the
brakes attempting to stop, there is a brief flash of the brake warning light on
each pump. Granted the servo isn't hooked up and there's still plenty of air
in the system, but I thought I'd have some pedal.

So my question: If the brakes are properly bled, will I get some come-back, or
will any attempts be nil by my tainted reservoir and even though it's not
leaking fluid out, could it be leaking enough air in - to prevent me from
gaining any pedal?
