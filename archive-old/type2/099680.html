Subject: Engine detailing

OK,
So I've had to go back to work after 6-7 years of just bumming around the 
world,
but it ain't all bad............

I bought another car ........... 1993 Mercedes 400E, and in starting to 
figure out how to keep it as clean and nice as my buses, I discovered a 
product that is awesome............

Belive it or not, this stuff will serve as an engine detailer for our VW 
air cooled engines like nothing else I have ever used. I tried it. It works !

Here is the link from whence I discovered this unusual use of a neato 
solution to keeping out bus engine pristine.

Figures! (Another ham radio type of guy !)

Prior to this I have always been using engine cleaner and then a second 
application of engine detailer after the first job dries properly.
I will still use the engine cleaner, but am going to start using this tire 
stuff instead of the engine detailer.
