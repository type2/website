Subject: Dist 180 off but it runs?

I got my Pertronix from Germansupply a few days ago and while I had
everything apart to reline my fuel tank I went ahead and pulled the
distributor to install it.

Somehow I lost my mind and installed it 180* off. No biggy, but why
would it run that way? I even drove it to the gas station just to see
how it would do. Pretty doggy, but it ran.

Bizarre...
