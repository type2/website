 The heater boxes are G and H in this pic:

 They are your exhaust manifolds, so you cannot remove them completely.

 Best suggestion for your problem would be to find a 411/412 with the gas
heater and get the mini heater boxes off of it. They are very compact.

Or put in hydraulic lifters.....


 &gt; Ok. Well Im pretty sure that its the heat exchanger. Thats what it looks
&gt; like to me. Its right below and to the side kinda of the heads in my 72 with
&gt; a type4 engine. Im right aren't I?? Then there is a tube thing that connects
&gt; each of them to these long cannals that goes to the front. So now that we
&gt; are all on the same page and you know what I'm talking about (cause you do
&gt; right??) What is the whole purpose behind it. Is it only for heating
&gt; purposes?? How do you remove it? Could I drive with it removed?? I live in
&gt; California and when do you ever need a heater in California? The reason that
&gt; I am asking is that I finally got around to taking things upon myself and
&gt; adjusting my own valves and the damn heat exchanger thing is right in the
&gt; way!! I was having a bear of a time adjusting them and I was hoping that I
&gt; could just take them out without any damage. Well Hope someone will give me
&gt; some feedback on this one. Thanks
