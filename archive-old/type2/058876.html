&gt; Well, after numerous calls and emails, I have been unable to find the
&gt; shift rod boots for my bus.

In a pinch,you can make your own.  Use vinyl upholstery fabric or
similar tough waterproof material.  Fashion a tube of the fabric big
enough to go over the shaft/boss/whatever.  Rig the ends to take a
nylon or wire drawstring.  Install, tighten the drawstrings, and you
have a serviceable boot.
