&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, I have to sell my Westy. I've been refurbishing my ghia
&gt; and it's costing more than anticipated.
&gt; I live in So. Cal and am asking $1700.

Also in So Cal (San Diego-- Ocean Beach to be exact) is a '74 van rusty in
the front, passinger format, blue.  windshield area rust looks likt it
might total it, but has engine and autotrans.  says 'needs work' the
seller is never home when I call. don't know other details. Call 619
224-9378. asking $600
