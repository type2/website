&gt;I am interested in the Oxygen sensor thing. Is there a pin out that the ECU
&gt;will connect to in order to add that info into the mix as part of the FI
&gt;installation? I understand from reading, that the CA versions have that. Are
&gt;the ECU's different or is this just un-monitored in the FED version. Do you
&gt;need to have the Cat installed? I run an S&amp;S extractor so I don't have one
&gt;in the mix. Even if the sensor isn't monitored by the ECU, do you have the
&gt;correct voltage readings for setting for the mixture? (or link)

79 &amp; up California do have the Lambda closed loop (O2 sensor ) Control
built in to the ECU.  For a good background on this and the O2 sensor I
recommend the following URL's :

I welded a 18 mm spark plug anti foul plug onto the elbow of one exhaust
port.  You can buy a Bosche O 2 sensor for under $20 at Auto zone.  I use
mine just to check richness of mixture and tune up.  You will see in the
above references that the O 2 sensor is set to measure what they call
stoich or perfect ( for emmissions) air fuel mixture of 14.7:1.  A chart in
the above also will show you that maximum performance is a little richer
than this _at_ 12.6:1 and best fuel economy at 15.4:1.  In checking the O 2
sensor readings after a emmissions check with idle CO _at_ 1% the multi meter
reading off the O 2 sensor averaged a little higher than stoiche (450 mv)
at approx 550-600mv.  Therefore, I think the spec for the bus is a little
richer than perfect.  I have a altitude switch and circuit on my bus.  This
is to lower the fuel mixture at altitude over what it would be at sea level
(actually it raises richness at sea level to correspond to denser air
volume).  Anyway, I plan to put a parrallel circuit up on the dash to raise
richness and give me extra power for climbing hills at the flip of a
switch.

Have fun
