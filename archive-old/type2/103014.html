Greg Potts graciously wrote:

&gt; Jamie Rivers carefully drilled a grille pattern into the dash of his
&gt; bus and repainted with semigloss black paint. He then installed a pair
&gt; of 3&quot;x9&quot; speakers which sound terrific and you would NEVER know it
&gt; isn't stock. He had to shop around a bit to find the right speakers but
&gt; they do exist.


Thanks Greg, here is a bit more info,,  I dunno about semigloss,, as the can I
had was called NO GLOSS..  but as long as it isn't Gloss,,, reflects too much
light,, and Flat,, catches all the dirt,, then your ok!

Also,, I used some surplus speakers that were about 3.5&quot; x 11&quot; iirc,,
