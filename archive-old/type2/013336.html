Hi David,

Who makes your Freeze 12.  I'm trying to avoid
confusion with FrigC made by Intercool.  Most FLAPS
seem to get the names confused, but probably would be
clear on the manufacturer.  I thought FrigC had a
great web site, but they recommend charging only in
liquid form (risky in my opinion).  Also you need to
be certified to buy FrigC.

Freeze 12 claims you can go ahead and charge as a
vapor.  I'm wondering if they are just trying to over
simplify things here, because I thought all blends
g\had to be liquid charged.  Note that as long as you
fully use an integral number of cans like you did,
liquid or vapor charging shouldn't matter.  Do you
need to be certified to buy Freeze 12?  Where do you
buy just a couple of cans?  I think you can buy a 12
can case on the internet for about $8/can not
including shipping.

Also, what type of can fittings did you use?  I've
heard you can use the R12 can side tap fitting on
Freeze 12.

Rob
