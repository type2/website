Laura,

&gt; I am looking for front and rear SIDE running lights/reflectors for our
&gt; two '71 buses.  I need the whole assembly for the dang things, not just
&gt; a lens or part.  Right now there are holes where those items should be,
&gt; front and rear.

I believe that I noticed the Bus Boys had a repro of these for $10 each,
and I think that included the lense and the electronics too.  Does anyone
else know that this is true, and has anyone actually seen them?  I
currently plan to buy a pair once I've got my engine stuff squared away.
