There's is an article in the www.type2_dot_com library on this under bodywork.

The correct link for a picture of what VW Brazil are doing is now http://www.wallace.bob.btinternet.co_dot_uk/type2/html/newbus/amazsnow.htm

Good luck

&gt; This brings up a question I've been meaning to ask fro some time.  Does
&gt; anyone have a solid info, or informed opinions on what the effect of
&gt; removing the dividers behind the front seats would have on the integrity
&gt; of the van?
