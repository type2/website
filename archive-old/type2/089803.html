&lt;&lt; 've been lurking on this list for a while, trying to find out all I can

about buses as I've been interested in owning one, and now that my chance

has come, I was wondering if any of you had any advice- what I should be

looking for, what I should avoid at all costs, etc.  I'm sure you get these

sorts of questions all the time, I just wasn't quite successful in finding

the info in the archive.  The bus in particular I'm looking at is a '71 with

a 1600cc engine.  Thanks in advance!

Rust,rust,rust,rust,rust (with apologies to K. Lear;-)
Everything else mechanical is easier...
Front beam first...
Rear suspension...
Chassis and floors...
Everything else...

The general consensus is, unless you're a proficient 
welder (or want to become one), the body is the
most expensive (time and money) to rebuild once
it starts to get noticeable/dangerous...

Relatively, the mechanicals are all rebuildable/
replaceable with new or good used from this 
list or its vendors...Creativity counts! Lots
of hints and tips on the list for various
work-arounds for hard to do procedures!

With a decent structure to start with,
many list members have used a bus and
rebuilt it while keeping it a daily driver...

Have fun!
