Subject: Re: Weber Progressive and 009

Chris,

My distributor is stock. The stock distributor is a combination of
centrifugal and vacuum advance. My Weber has a vacuum advance port
pointing toward the rear of the bus.

Yes, the box under the carb has a port for the vacuum assist.

I bought my carb as a kit (I don't remember where) for my year bus (77).
I'm not sure all Weber kits come with the vacuum ports.

Best of Luck,

TBone

&gt; &gt; I have a Weber Progressive on my 77 Westy and it runs great. It idles
&gt; &gt; sweet, has just as much power and I still get 18-21 MPG - just like I
&gt; &gt; did before my FI system died.
&gt; &gt; stock vacuum/centrifugal dizzy.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it a centrifugal advance distributor (009) or a vacum advance distributor (stock) and if so, where does your vacuum plug
into on your carb? Does your  fuel distribution box under the carb have
a port for the brake vacuum assist as well?  Thanks,
