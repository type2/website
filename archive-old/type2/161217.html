Subject: New rockers

 I am going to put new inner and outer rockers on a '77 bus (cosed top, not a sunroof or camper) and due to both the additional expense, additional difficulty of installation, and the fact that it looks like it would be easier for corrosion to set in again, I plan to leave the middle rocker section out. (the one that goes between the outer rocker skin and the inner rocker)  I will remove the old pieces entirely, and replace them with weld in (not slip over) replacement pieces.
Is there any real reason to put the middle rocker piece in?  I am usually sort of a stickler for authenticity, but in this case I decided that, hey, the splits didn't have a middle piece, it will be harder for me to thoroughly rustproof the new replacement rocker assembly, and 100 bucks ($50 or so each side, both sides) is a hundred bucks, so if I don't need to spend it, why do so?  
I realize that the middle piece would add strength, but enough to justify replacement?  This is not a work bus that will be pounded over rough roads daily.  
Anyone else done it this way?  Anyone care to offer an opinion as to the need for the middle rocker?
If I have to, I can brake out a piece of steel to replicate most of the middle piece, but I don't want to.  
Thanks,
Greg
