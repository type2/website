andrew,
when i was looking through the library on the type 2
website i was reading about the timing and the type 4
engine does not have a specific mark it will line up
with like the bug motors.   whenever ive adjusted my
valves i just work off where the rotor goes and ive
had good luck with that.   as for your tin, i would
try and secure that back in place, those old german
guys put it on there for a reason so id keep it.   i
actually was just searching in the archives about
engine tin and was reading a post from bob hoover (vw
guru) and he was telling of the importance of those
very tins you speak of...so fix em up and put em back
on.   i was missing some tin on my bus engine when i
first bought it and was learning about it, and that
engine does not exist anymore...so i try to keep my
tin in good working order.

&gt; Hello Folks.
&gt; 
&gt; Was going to do my first valve set on my bus. I read
&gt; two manuals and had one question before I try it. I
&gt; know you line up the rotor on the notch on the
&gt; distributor for TDC position #1. I remember that on
&gt; a bug engine that the notch on the fly wheel also
&gt; lined up with a block seem I think. But with mine
&gt; (pancake 1700) do the notches on the fly wheel line
&gt; up with anything? Or do I simply trust the alignment
&gt; of the rotor. I would run out and look again (but my
&gt; bus is 20 miles away in a friends garage).
&gt; 
&gt; Also when I replace my front brakes, calipers and
&gt; pads, do I also have to bleed the rear brakes as
&gt; well? (I got this feeling that the bleeder valves on
&gt; the rear will be frozen).
&gt; 
&gt; One more thing..I dont use my heat at all. Is it
&gt; really important to have those two small pieces of
&gt; tin on both sides that screw to the block and on the
&gt; bottom of the heat exchangers..the ones that
&gt; cover/block acess to the push rod tubes from the
&gt; bottom..I have all the compartment seals and
&gt; everything is good but those pieces are about to
&gt; fall off and I dont know if they are that major in
&gt; cooling the engine...besides a TINY oil leak on one
&gt; push rod tube lets iol flow onto the hot
&gt; exchanger=smoke! (I promise to fix the leak but can
&gt; I just remove the cover for now?
&gt; 
&gt; I know lots O' questions...but I am ready to take my
&gt; own repair &quot;to the next level&quot; and am SO glad to
&gt; have &quot;the list&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Peace
&gt; Andrew
