Subject: Re: [T2] RichWeber/600v .047uF

I guess, at least to me, that this is one of the problems with
type 4 engines--the carb problems are not as easily solved as with
the type1-3.  OTOH my bus did run very nicely for a long time
with the DFAV in there--cant really complain.  One big problem with
those set-ups is the EXTREME chintziness of the manifolds, which
is what I think may have caused the problems I am having now with
idling
But I'm doing a complete cleaning of the fuel system also-could
have multiple causes.
If I had enough money to devote to VWs, I would seriously think
about an aftermarket FI kit.
