Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

My '81 Westy has brown curtains with that burlap texture. My Campmobile
manual says to handwash them in a mild detergent and then line dry.
The PO of my Westy was a smoker, and the curtains were really smelly
and dirty, so I took a chance. I put them in the washer on the gentle
cycle with some Ivory Snow, and then line dryed them. They came out
looking like new.
