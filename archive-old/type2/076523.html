Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line blues OVER!

&gt; In the fuel injected models the filter is a square type which mounts
&gt; imediately prior to the pump and takes a slightly larger diameter hose from
&gt; the filter to the pump. I was able to use 7/16 hose here, but I suspect a
&gt; closer metric equivalent would be better. That hose is only a few inches
&gt; long. 

The hose between the filter and pump is 10mm.
All the other FI fuel hose is 7.5mm.
