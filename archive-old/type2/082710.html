Subject: Price Guide Needed

Dear All,

I am looking for a price guide for selling my '68
combi in the uk, it is currently in RSA, in a friends
garage, It is in fine working condition, reconditioned
engine 2 years ago. If anyone can give me a ball park
price for what i could expect it to be worth, its
worth my life to me, please get intouch. Or if you
know a website with a guide on it, that would help
greatly.

Simon Gray
