&gt; I'm thinking I'd like to eventually work towards one of those.
&gt; I like the looks of the split windshield and those skylights.  Wondering
&gt; about prices.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.

   Like any other vehicle that has crossed the line into &quot;collectible&quot;, the
Splittie is quite expensive (as compared to baywindows...;-(
&quot;Restored&quot; (whatever that may be in each particular case) versions
are around at prices that make them investments rather than daily
drivers...That said, I'm sure that a reasonably priced one can be
discovered...but probably in need of a lot of work...
