Subject: Re: [T2] Asian tools

John Muir's advice to would-be VW tinkerers is to get the best tools 
you can find--and his rationale was because these tools are a joy to 
fondle after you bust your knuckles on an insoluable problem.

Stewart Brand, a philosopher of technology and erstwhile publisher of 
the Whole Earth Catalog, takes the opposite tack. Buy the cheapest tool 
you can find and only when it becomes indispensible should you buy the 
best you can afford. ( I blogged the exact quote here: 
http://www_dot_deadbus_dot_org/archives/2005/02/philosophy_on_t.html )

Every bus pilot must find her own way between these two extremes. 
Personally I am thrilled with the Chinese-made 117 piece Dura-Built 
mechanic's kit that I got at Target for less than one US Grant. Almost 
everything you need for a bus emergency in one handy blow-mold case. 
Fits nicely beneath the bed in my Westie and if someone forces their 
way in through the busted wind-wing, I'm not out hundreds of bucks.

Of course, the biggest problem with cheap tools is that they are often 
not manufactured to close tolerances. Thus you wind up rounding off 
nuts and bolts. Buying expensive name brand tools is a fairly easy way 
to ensure that you are getting well-manufactured tools.

I work in the advertising department of everyone's favorite Cheap Crap 
tool emporium and I have a few observations to make (before the list 
admin shuts down this thread)--

1) Cheap Chinese tools are getting better all the time. It's the tools 
from India, Pakistan, Burma and Guyana that you have to watch out for,
2) Many of our tools are made in the same factories as pricey US 
brands--DeWalt, Milwaukee, Porter Cable, Chicago Pneumatic--buying 
American doesn't always mean American-made
3) If the US has its way and persuades China to let the yuan &quot;float&quot; 
nobody in the US will be able to afford to buy Chinese tools. So get 
them while they're cheap! ;-)

&gt; When I was in the auto industry (publishing/Professional Tool &amp;
&gt; Equipments News) I had friends who owned Schley Tools (SP Tools) in
&gt; Anaheim, CA and they absolutely DETESTED the Asian import/export guys
&gt; who would come to the ASIA/AAIW show and buy tools to clone as cheapo
&gt; knock-offs back in their homelands.
&gt;
&gt; Good guys. I promised them I would NEVER buy an imported tool. With the
&gt; exception of my Beta Tools (a present from Beta) all of my tools are
&gt; Made in America.
