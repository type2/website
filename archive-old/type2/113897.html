I recommend you not add an external cooler.  :-)

&gt;I think I will mount the cooler under the cargo floor area of the
&gt;bus horizintally.

How are you planning on protecting it from road hazards?

&gt; Do you guys think the air flow there will be good or
&gt;should I try to locate the cooler somewhere where I can get better airflow
&gt;through the cooler, if so where?

There really isn't a good place that gets &quot;natural&quot; airflow.  An electric fan can solve this problem, allowing you to put the cooler almost anywhere.  It also makes it somewhat easier to maintain oil temperature (you can utilize a thermostat to switch the fan on and off).

&gt; Oil temps on the bus have approaced 250
&gt;when pushing it hard on a warm day, sump mounted VDO sender and gauge.

That's not very hot... if you have good oil pressure and synthetic oil.
