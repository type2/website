&gt; Anyone have a VW jack and/or a rim for a '73 bus for sale?  Mine came sans

Jeff:
I think it's important that when posting requests like this to the list
that you say where you are. Not necessarily your street adress but state
or region (ie no. Cal or s. Cal) would be good. I can help you if you're
in the midwest but shipping a wheel and jack to Europe or New Zealand or
Japan from Iowa would be absurd. Get my point?
