Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

my favorite supplier is here:
  http://www.partsonsale_dot_com/
really nice folks and quirky biz with good prices in southern cal, but 
they'll ship anywhere.
Have done biz with them in the past for both my off grid projects in 
the states and mexico.
  I currently have the XP250-12 EXELTECH 250 watt inverter in the 
splitty. Using a single 120 AH deep cell battery split off a 75 amp 
alt. This runs the powerbook and various other gizmos for a LONG time. 
I'm a definite fan of pure sine if you can afford it. Makes a whirrrled 
of difference if you're making or listening to music of any kind.
Will prolly install the 1100 in the 69 when I do the cabinetry and 
shelving this spring. This is my work rig and I'm looking for something 
that can run a big tool or two occasionally. Also plan to pop a solar 
cell on the westy poptop (small euro type) for added boost when way out 
in the boonies.
