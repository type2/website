Subject: When Vr6 Eurovan to USA?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Greetings all type 2 citizens,
Our list shows that the count for 98 Eurovan  = 0, Because you can't buy one
yet, not here in the second largest VW entry port in the USA??? Why? I guess
VWOA is too busy having a flashback in the backseat of a new &quot;Beetle&quot; or
should I say Bolf for Beetle-golf, to get the #1 selling van from Europe to
the #1 market in time for the spring thaw. All 97's are sold out, The big 3
wish they could say that.
But I have been waiting for the 6 cylinder version since 1990.

If anyone has a 98 Eurovan  VR6 Camper FS please let me know.
