&gt;&gt;From my experience, impact sockets are a ton tougher. I heft a big one
&gt;inch air gun around all day (i sell truck tires-what a crappy job) and
&gt;I've never had a socket for it break. If (more like when) i ever have to
&gt;break that big rear axle nut on my westy, you can bet I won't be leaning
&gt;on a big breaker bar...whirrrrrrrrrr...all done. :)

I bought an air impact gun and a big socket some years ago for pulling the
axel nut and the nut that holds flywheel on. Mostly works good.
