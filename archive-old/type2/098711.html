Subject: Crankshaft and camshaft storage- vertical or horizontal?

Does anyone have any actual *facts* why crankshafts supposedly bend and 
warp from being stored laying flat?

I have a very difficult time believing the weight of the crank itself 
is somehow able to plastically deform the steel, but the forces from 
running the engine won't.

Basically, I think it's an old machinists tale, but folks seem to 
believe it's true.  My engineering background says it's BS, but I'm 
willing to change my mind if I had good evidence.
