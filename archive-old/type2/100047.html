Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge won't go to 1/1 (Eleven!)

&gt; I had similar problems when I replaced my fuel tank sender; the gauge
&gt; would max out at somewhere between 3/4 and 1/1 with a full tank.  After
&gt; all that monkeying around, though, I wasn't about to go back and try to
&gt; fine tune the system!

I received some private emails about this and it seems that it's happening a
lot.  I would have expected a VDO part like this to work as is but it seems
before you install it you need to compare it to the one you are throwing out
(if it's not totally hosed).

Measuring the resistance probably isn't enough: I noticed that there are
tabs at the bottom of the sender that control the range of movement of the
float.  I bet these have to be bent the same as the original and then
compared before installation.  Ohm well. :-)
