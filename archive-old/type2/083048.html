&gt; Subject: Re: Quote for type 4 bus engine
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have a carburated type 4 bus engine, with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;stock dual solex setup.  What is the ballpark
&gt; &gt;price for a conversion, and also a ballpark if
&gt; I
&gt; &gt;put in a 1600 type 1. 
 
&gt; basic T4 kit is $670, basic T1 kit $760.  There
&gt; are some options for easier
&gt; starting, $80 more total. There are some T1
&gt; power upgrades, T4 's are fine
&gt; as is.
&gt; 
&gt; My website is now at www.sandrail_dot_com/millerfi
&gt; (just go their front page
&gt; and into my site).
&gt; 
&gt; My prices are posted there, I appreciate any
&gt; and all publicity, I don't
&gt; spend money on magazine ads. Please tell all
&gt; abou the new website location,
&gt; the same search words get you there, just not
&gt; the URL.
&gt; 
&gt; T4's are very simple and fast to convert, a
&gt; later FI bus tank is  a great
&gt; idea to speed the conversion. Otherwise, audi
&gt; (and VW) Fox cars have a nice
&gt; external fuel sump fine for such use. My welded
&gt; sumps are $120, for the
&gt; hardcore off-road driver.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a lot of info on the site, it is there
&gt; to share.
