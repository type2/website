Volks...
  The PO tinted the windows of my '68 bus and he painted the outside jalousie frames (the alluminum part) black to match. Well, i removed the tinting because I just don't like tinted windows on my Bus. Any suggestions on removing the paint? I was thinking of using steel wool, but I don't want to scratch them all up.
  
thanks in advance,
James 68 Bus
