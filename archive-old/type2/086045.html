Subject: type 4 case

I just split the case on my 2.0 l engine yesterday, expecting to
find much better news than I got when I split my type 3 case a couple
of weeks ago--but like the type 3, I
found the parts number from main bearing
#2 (?? the one that splits apart..)imprinted in the bore--
Does this mean that the case for sure needs align boring or can
it just be from oil discoloration?  I am beginning to think that
any case I split will look like this.  Also, could someone explain
to me what &quot;fretting&quot; actually looks like?  Do you see this on the
flat part of the case web or on the edges?  Is there a shop anyone
can recommend which will honestly assess what shape my case is in?
I don't want to align bore it if I can avoid it.
Thanks!
