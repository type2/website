&gt; Hello Everyone--
&gt;
&gt; I am in the process of replacing my intake manifold on a 1600 dp and I need
&gt; to remove the Generator. However...I cannot loosen the Pulley nut...I am
&gt; putting the screwdriver in the slot...and turning the wrench
&gt; counterclockwise...but it will not budge...tried soaking in WD40 but
&gt; nothing....Just looking for some ideas...I have thought about cutting the the
&gt; belt...pulling the Generator...taking the Generator to a shop and having them
&gt; use an impact wrench on it? Good idea or no? Thanks everyone...

the pulley nut takes a fair amount of torque (46 ft-lb?)  Make sure that
the screwdriver is firmly between the pulley slot and the boss on the
generator.  You might try having one person hold the screwdriver and the
other work with the wrench.  Use a long handle and consider what will
happen if the nut lets go suddenly!
