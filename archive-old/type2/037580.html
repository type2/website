Subject: RE: electrical connectors for FI engine

My Wifes car is a 93 Saturn. The FI connectors on the Saturn fit Bosch
injectors perfectly. Advantage -- they have a release on the wire bail that
hold the connector on the injector and an improved electrical boot as well.
Not to mention they are nearly 20 years fresher!
