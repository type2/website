&gt; Hey Volks,

&gt; Not specifically bus-related, but I was wondering how long a helicoil
&gt; fix for a spark plug should last?

&gt; My transportation appliance needed a helicoil for the plug about a
&gt; year ago; a local shop put one in (w/o pulling the head; aluminum head
&gt; BTW.)  When I tried to change the plugs, the helicoil came out, stuck
&gt; to the old plug they put in. (Really stuck.)

&gt; I talked to the shop today, &amp; they said it was only a temp. fix, &amp; I
&gt; should expect to have to change helicoils each time I changed plugs.

A properly installed helicoil should not come out.  Sounds to me that the
shop didn't do it right and are now trying to BS their way out.  You
certainly should not have to install a new helicoil with every plug
change.

That being said, there are better inserts for spark plug use.
