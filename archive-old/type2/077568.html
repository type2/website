Subject: starter hanging up?

--part1_12.19f3eb47.29930ae8_boundary

The bus in question is older but the question relates, my bus will start up 
every morning and run me to work.  Usually it will restart but often it will 
just click, and then I grab a screwdriver and flashlight, crawl under and 
cross the starter and vroom.  What gives??
