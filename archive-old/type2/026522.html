&gt;And also, don't bother to tell me that the system never drains, since 
&gt;the other end of the oil passages are cetrainly above the 'water table'

I was wondering if anyone would bring that up.  I've 1/2 of a type IV motor
on my engine stand right now and I'll look at it tonight to see just where
the 'water table' is in relation to the pickup tube and the pump.  I started
wondering the same thing as soon as this thread started.  I'll report late
tonight or tomorrow morning on my findings unless someone puts this to rest
sooner.
