Subject: Tanny mount sealing rings

Greetings,
In the process of de-gunking the trans out of my 72, I dislodged some nylon looking rings. They came from the sleeves that the trans carrier bolts go through. According to Bentley, ch.6 p.12, Fig 4.1 #5, they are sealing rings. What exactly are they supposed to seal? How critical are they? Does anyone out there happen to know a part number for said rings?
TIA
