Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

Also, take a winch (&quot;come along&quot;) and a good, stout rope or two, so that you
can pull yourself out if you do get stuck. It's also good to have an old
piece of cheap carpet in there that you can throw down in front of your tire
if it's spinning in the mud.. branches work, too.
