Subject: Battery Power Mystery

Last night I was working on my hot start / Bosch WR-1 relay / solenoid 
problem.

I wanted to check the actual voltage coming down the wire from ignition 
switch to the solenoid.  So, I clamped my digital Multimeter on the female 
connector of the wire from the ignition switch and then onto a grounded nut. 
  I had my helper turn the key on, and just less than 1 volt was showing on 
the meter.

Right. Corroded female connector..  (Female connectors, they're all alike!!)

Step two: sharpen a tiny brad (like a nail, but smaller) and slip it into 
the wire (from the ignition switch) like an intravenous needle, and check 
the continuity from the female connector to the brad.  If I got some 
resistance, I imagined that the brad had pierced some of the metal core of 
the wire (from the ignition switch).  Same procedure as above.  Digital 
multimeter from brad to grounded nut. I had my helper turn the key on, and 
NOTHING!!  Zero!!  Zilch...  (battery WAS reconnected for this test.  I have 
a quick disconnect and use it religiously.)

Right. Perhaps the nut ground was a bad choice; not good ground.

Step three:  I ran the digital multiMeter to the battery connection on the 
solenoid, and did not disturb the ground to the nut.  I got up, reached for 
the battery quick disconnect and reconnected the battery.  I looked down at 
the Digital Multimeter and saw an expected 12.47 volts.

Great.  The nut ground is a good spot.

I reached and turned the battery disconnect off.  (This disconnect is on the 
negative ground terminal, connecting and disconnecting the battery negative 
terminal from the ground strap.  A simple twist will break the connection.  
I usually twist more than is needed.)

I went back for the 'still connected' Digital multiMeter, and low and behold 
I was reading voltage.  Significant voltage, like almost a full volt!!.  And 
the hundredths digit was clicking down, 6, 5, 4, 3, like that.

What's going on, science teachers out there!!  I wanted to see if I could 
get a light bulb to light with this residual voltage. (What amperage I could 
expect, I don't know)

Step four:  Mr. Electric, you don't mess with the kid.  I'l show this 
poltergeist!!

I connected my second multi meter, and analog one, right with the digital 
MultiMeter, red wire to red wire, black to black; reds to solenoid power 
post, blacks to good nut ground.  Battery on.  Both reading over 12 volts.  
Battery off.  Both reading over 1 volt.  BOTH!!

Yes, we know the Digital MultiMeter is accurate to the  hundredths, but we 
also know that an analog multimeter NEVER LIES.  Like my teen age kids, not 
exactly as accurate as you would like, but never lies.

What a sight this must have been, an over_forty gentleman, stone sober, on 
his back under a VW bus, cheering on the analog meter to beat the DMM down 
to zero, encouraging the analog with words and shakes, and nasty looks at 
the DMM (modern do-hickie upstart DMM!!)

Who won?? I don't know.  I had to clean up and pick up my teen age son from 
his school. But I'll bet the electric clock is happy for this little rest.
