Subject: Need a cherry picker in Sunnyvale, CA area
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9906291613260.1428-100000_at_shell19.ba.best_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks,

If anyone in the Sunnyvale, California vicinity has a cherry picker -
style engine hoist that I could borrow for a couple of days, I'd be much
obliged...

Alternatively, suggestions are welcome for methods of moving a complete
TypeIV motor from inside the cargo area of one bus, into the garage, and
then (later) installing it into another bus.

TIA,

-chad
