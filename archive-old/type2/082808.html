Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels (fri. musing)

Glen,
I'd thought about doing that myself, but for the opposite reason.  I
want to be able to mount lower profile tires on 15&quot; steel wheels, and
lose less gearing than doing the same on a 14&quot; wheel.  Living In SoCal,
I rarely see dirt roads, except for the 2-3 times a year for camping.

I would think there might be some rubbing on the inner fenders, depending
on how big of a tire you chose.  You would definitely see more sky underneath,
but your center of gravity moves up as well.  

L8,

&gt; 
&gt; What would the complications be to putting 15&quot; wheels
&gt; on my '68 bus? I'm half-serious. Besides the speedo
&gt; issue, would they fit under there? Would it affect
&gt; stability or handling? How much ground clearance would
&gt; I gain?
