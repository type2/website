Subject: Re: [T2] kill switch placement ?

The standard batter cutoff switch would work if you dont have anything 
that needs to be powered (clocks, radios memory etc)

BTW i am getting ready to use one of those as my jumper cable to self 
jump.  Will connect aux batt to main for jumping.

e:

&gt; Since I have my ignition ripped out of my bus, I thought this might be 
&gt; a good time to add a kill switch to prevent unwanted moving of said bus 
&gt; by unauthorized people.  Has anyone installed a kill switch that could 
&gt; lend some advice?
