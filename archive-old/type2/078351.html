Subject: replacing windsheld and rubber together?


Hi, folks:

I've got some leaking going on this winter around the windshield of my 1970. 
The rubber is pretty seriously cracked and dried, but the original glass 
itself seems in good shape: one little nick and the usual amount of wiper 
etching.

Here's my question: Putting aside cost questions [for the moment!], does it 
make sense to replace the rubber without replacing the glass? Or is that 
being penny wise and pound foolish--is it better just to replace them both 
at the same time and be done with it?

FWIW, I'd almost certainly have the work done; I don't have the place or 
help [or inclination] to take it on myself.

Also, while the glass is out, there are some pinpoints of rust and one dent 
to be fixed, and possibly some more under the old rubber, if that makes any 
difference.

Thanks for any advice.

best
