Subject: Re: [T2] replacement body panels

I was luck to have original sheet metal to do the whole lower part of this  
78 westy (one of the other buses was brown)
 
Most of the aftermarket sheet metal for the bays lack quality and hard to  
work with. 
 
Cost is determined by the quality of work and the parts and supplies  needed. 
as said you could spend as much as 3 times more. 
 
 
I have the rear hatch from the brown 78 and willing to ship just email  me.
