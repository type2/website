Subject: rolls down, not up...

Listees,

My window now rolls down but not up. It's like when you spin to go up it's
not catching the mechanism. I can get the window but by physically pushing
up on the glass while spinning and it catches.

I assume the mechanism (is that the window regulator) behind the part that
attaches to the handle is the culprit. I can easily switch out with the one
off my parts bus - is there anything weird about this job that I should be
aware of? Does it operate a cable or what? Any insight is appreciated.
