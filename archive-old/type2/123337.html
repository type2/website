Subject: Re: [T2] Friday OT (sort of) Por-15 &quot;leftover&quot; storage

While searching for an inert gas filled automobile storage container I
came across this:

http://www.bloxygen_dot_com/faq.html

I wonder if it would be good for those half-cans of (expensive) POR-15
products that everyone ends up throwing out after a few weeks?

------------------------------------------------

this is probably going to get some flames but i've used propane in quart
cans to accomplish this.  note that cans were stored in cool dry place and
usually finished in 6 months or so.  propane is heavier than air thats
why they won't let you carry it in your car when you buy it at an
industrial gas distribution place.  just use our little propane torch to
pump some gas in and seal it up. you don't need to pump ton of propane in
the can just enough to sit over the paint and block the oxygen.
