Subject: Rebuilding Type II engine

        I currently have a Type 1 engine in my 72 bus.  I have obtained a 
complete type II engine, but I have know idea of the condition of this engine. 
 I would like to rebuild it, so that I have a known reliable engine.  If any 
list members have any insight as to where to buy parts, I would like to know.  
I would like to get a complete kit with all the necessary parts to do this 
rebuild. 
        What should I do first?  What should I look for to let me know if the 
engine can even be rebuild.  So far, all I know is that I can turn the 
alternator belt, and the crank pulley will turn.  I don't know if this is a 
1700 or 1800 or whatever.  How can I tell?  It have been modified to that a 
single carburator.  BTY, I got this engine free, but I really want a bus 
engine, not a van engine in willie. 
        Any help and advice would be wonderful. 
 
                                                Thank You,  
                                                  
                                                Stuart Neil
