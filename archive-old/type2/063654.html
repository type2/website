Subject: Help! 1980 westy fans!

I just bought a 1980 westy and now I've been bombarded by an avalance of
opinions; my fear is that some of the naysayers are right and I just tossed
away a significant chunk of change with much more yet to follow!  I need a
little help here folks and all I'm asking for is opinions and the benefit of
your experiences.  This is the story: This bus has a recently rebuilt 1980
engine but the nice old german guy who did the work (used to be on the line
in Wolfsburg) told me that the 1980 heads are of poor quality and prone to
failure of the valve seats.  His solution was to reengineer some exhaust
manifolds so that 1977 heads could be used on this engine (I didn't know
this until after the purchase from another person who volunteered this info
after the sale).  He unfortunately did his spot welds right at the flanges
that hold the manifolds to the heads and one cracked loose within hours of
my purchase (so I guess that means that they held for about 20K if everyone
is telling the truth).  I discussed this modification with a fellow who owns
a VW shop and the result of our conversation was (1) I must now replace
these heads with the proper 1980 head since there is no way to get welds to
hold in this vicinity (he mentioned heli-arc but said forget that too), and
(2) fix it and ditch the bus because the 1980 engines are garbage.  He said
that when VW went to using hydraulic lifters and the oxygen sensor systems
in these last of the air cooled engines that the heads simply ran at too
high of a temp for oil to preserve and protect them so head failures will
remain a constant problem, hence buy older or newer but get rid of this bus!
OK, my question is: is this all true? What have other peoples experiences
been with this engine, and should I go back to the proper heads or just
write this whole thing off to experience and send this bus on its merry way?
