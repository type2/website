Subject: bus pictures

Since it's friday I thought I'd send along my webpage address for anyone
who's interested in checking out pictures of my bus &amp; beetle.  I've been
hard at work sanding my bus down to the original white paint, getting it
prepped for paint sometime in the future.  Anyway, here's the addy:
