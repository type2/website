I have found that the correct timing is essential for mine.  I have an
upright but here it goes.  If you can ever get it to idle I would try things
like adjusting the timing while it's running to where it sounds/feels good.
You can go back later to make sure it is set correctly but this will give
you an idea of whether or not it is a timing problem (worked for me anyway,
I had a 009 dist and was timing it as if it were the original dist).  I
wouldn't worry about the smoke yet.  Could it be a fuel delivery problem?
