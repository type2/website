Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filter


Bigger filter should not affect system in any way that I am aware of. But
definately put it prior to the pump. Never put anything between the pump
and the rest of the system. You will surely affect fuel pressure and FI is
very sensitive to that. Just because your filter is bigger doesn't mean you
dont have to change it as often though.

I'm unhappy with the filters that are recommended for a Type IV engine, so
I
thought I'd plumb in a metal line, and use the same big canister that my
Chevy Silverado uses.

Questions:  Will this create too much drag for the basic-type electric fuel
pump with presumed 5-10 psi?  Optimal place for a filter before or after
the
pump(yes I know I asked this question before but I forgot the answer)?

This is for a 76 2.0liter with 2bbl carb.  Presently doesn't have a filter.

Thanks.
