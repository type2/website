Subject: Hard starting cured

Hey all,
You may remember I was having a problem with hard starting on my '81 
when the engine was cold.

Later I learned that I had a charging system problem.

Well it turns out the two problems were indeed related.  After 
installing a spare used alternator and new voltage regulator and 
charging the battery, the van with cold engine now starts easily on the 
first try again.  Also seems to have more power.  Interesting.

The charging is still not up to what it should be, but it's quite a bit 
better than it was.  I probably will wind up taking my original 
alternator in for a rebuild and installing it sometime down the road.

Thanks for everyone's help!
