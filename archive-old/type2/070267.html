sounds pretty bad- all those munches and rust and bad mechanicasl

I had heard that this bus might be had for as little as $100.  This 
from the guy who had been working on it until it's most recent demise.
The asking price?  $1,000.  I tried not to laugh.  I offered $100.  He
mentioned that he was thinking of parting it out but wasn't sure how 
to go about that.

that sounds fair- $100,  or  a bit more .  
pluses:
roof rack - 
camper kit
maybe - motor --- oil is oil, 28K isnt too much for more use, how is the end
play?  (push/pull
                         on the crank pulley).   can you do a compression
test on it?

maybe you can find a bus with  decent body and dead motor and do a little
switching over
