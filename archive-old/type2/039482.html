Subject: Re: need help with pistons and cylinders

    Nope, for long life you need to pull them all apart measure both the ring 
gaps and piston clearances. You 'must' clean them completely to remove all 
the cosmoline they are packed with or the rings will not seal completely 
especially if they are chrome rings. Clean them with a good scoring cleaner 
like ajax or boraxo and flush completely with clean water. I take the extra 
time to paint the cyl's in black for heat transfer. The rings are 'not' that 
fragil if you take your time and dont bend them too far, I have never broken 
a ring and believe me I've boken many other parts. You could just slap it 
together and it would probably work, but for how long and how much power.
