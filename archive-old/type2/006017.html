Subject: Emergency Brake: 1972 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;01BF15D6.6C9741E0_at_castles163_dot_castles_dot_com&gt;

All:
I can't get the E-brakes to work on my '72 Westy.  I installed new brake cylinders and pads.  The E-brake cable lever does not engage the brake shoes when the lever is pulled as far as it will go.   In fact, there seems to be about 1/4-1/2 inch of play left (actually a gap of that space between the e-brake cable lever and the pin that holds it to the brake shoe).  I originally purchased a set of pads from my mechanic.  It took me awhile to get to the brakes, and after I finally got them on, adjusted, etc., my mechanic had closed shop, after seven years.  

I called RMMW and ordered new pads, assuming that the pads I had were the wrong ones.  We went through the chassis number protocol (my Westy's is 232 204 7025).  The individual I was speaking with mentioned that this was an &quot;odd&quot; one, but was able to &quot;cross-ref&quot; it.  I got the pads from RMMW and they are exactly the same as the ones I have installed and taken off (to accurately compare). 

There just seems to be too much distance between the brake pads for the e-brake cable lever to even begin to engage the brake shoes.  My simplistic mind tells me that the holes that the e-brake cable lever is connected to the brake pads by need to be closer to each other or alternatively, the e-brake cable lever should be longer.  The brakes are adjusted and bled (three times!) and work well.   I just don't have any e-brake.

I feel I have at least two options:
1) Find someone who really knows brakes for this year/model and purchase another set of pads from him/her (any recommendations?)
2) Convert the rear brakes to 1973 and later.  This seems good, although somewhat more expensive, but brake parts seem more readily available. 


I have read all the archive posts that seem even remotely applicable to my problem (all 512 hits....) and found nothing that addresses this.  Can anyone recommend what I should do?

Thanks
Mark
