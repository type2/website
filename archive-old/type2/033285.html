&gt; Actually I read about the structure support from your on line brochure (love
&gt; that thing!) It stated that there is a continuous steel &quot;rollbar&quot; above the
&gt; rear passengers(I would assume at the outer lip of the rear over head
&gt; storage) and &quot;a similar structure protects the driver and passenger up
&gt; front&quot; . 

D-OH! I don't read the text, I just look at the pret-ty pictures. Ya
caught me! :-) Boy, is my face red!

That continuous rollbar over the passengers is not in my bus because I
have a top bunk back where the rear overhead storage is on the brochure
-- the giant can opener went all the way to the back. I have a full top
without the exterior storage rack towards the back.

&gt; area(towards hull) I hvnt seen pics of your interior so Im speaking of Blue
&gt; but I wouldnt think they could change the make up of the shell itself too

I really need to scan and upload my interior pics. I've got some from
before I finished the curtains. Thanks for the noodge. I also need to
photo that '79 at Wolfgang's.

&gt; minus the two kids sleeping up front( theres gotta be a law against cramming
&gt; that little boy up there!)

You think that's bad?! The brochure says that an additional small child
can sleep on a mat under the end of the main bed in the back! Call DCS
[Department of Child Services]!!! LOL
