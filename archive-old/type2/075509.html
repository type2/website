Subject: Re: [VB] Listee stickers?

Well, I can help out with badge prices.  My 90-year-young father runs an
engraved plastic badge and sign business.

Figure on about $7 per badge for a 2X3 badge with name, simple line art
logo, and name of group.  Add shipping and a small donation for the list
fund and the price would come out to an even $10

I like the sticker idea too.  I'm sure that the type2 list would be
interested, so I'm crossposting it there as well.

&gt; Yeah, that describes him.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I really enjoy meeting new listees at the
&gt; &gt; shows...but since there are so many
&gt; &gt; of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking
&gt; &gt; of this - small simple window sticker
&gt; &gt; stating 'vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com'
&gt;
&gt; I agree, but we ought to have a lapel pin, too.  Or
&gt; some way to identify ourselves while wandering around
&gt; shows.  Orange hats like P&amp;C?  I've been to lots of
&gt; shows where I had no idea who the listees were.  And
&gt; then I read later that someone was there.  At my age,
&gt; even the guys I know should have name tags!  I
&gt; remember you though, Beto.
