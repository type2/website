Subject: Re: Timing Marks

&gt;Greetings all...

&gt;I'm getting ready to put an engine into my '69 westy this weekend and have
&gt;a few questions.

&gt;I read through the Bently manual as well as Muir, but can't quite figure
&gt;out which mark I should time my engine to.  The engine that came with the
&gt;bus (and is being reinstalled) is marked &quot;F 1198621&quot; and has two marks on
&gt;the crank.  None of the illustrations in Muir correspond, bently doesn't
&gt;have a &quot;F&quot; engine listed, and when I checked the list of engine numbers in
&gt;the back of muir, it appears that this engine is a 1300 from a bug.  That
&gt;can't be right can it?

&gt;Anybody have a clue which of the two marks I should time it to?  Anybody
&gt;have any clue what kind of engine I have?

&gt;Somewhat confused...

VW used so many different timing mark configurations that they finally
started selling replacement pulleys
with only a TDC mark, no timing marks at all.  The only consistent mark on
any of the pulleys is the TDC mark
on the later style pulley, I guess after about '73 or '73. If you find a
concave mark on the rear lip of the pulley,
that is a TDC mark.  Anything else is suspect unless you can reference it to
the TDC mark.  If you're in doubt,
Locate TDC for #1 by feeling through the plug hole with a dial indicator,
positive stop device, or just by feeling with a screwdriver or something.
In all cases the timing at idle RPM is a function of the distributor in use,
not the engine itself.  If in doubt, set the
maximum advance at about 30 Degrees and let the idle advance fall wherever
it winds up.
I hope this helps, anyone with specific questions can e-mail me and ask.
I'll try to help.
