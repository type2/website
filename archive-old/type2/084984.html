Subject: Re: [T2] shafts on trans axle or off?

At 12:45 PM 5/27/2002 -0500, you wrote:

I put the axles on after I install the engine and tranny as a unit.

&gt;how hard is that shift linkage to line up?

Not at all.  You will need an assistant to pull the stick shift backwards.
Then, you will guide the coupler over the shift rod, as your assistant
pushes the stick forward.

If you have not replaced the shift rod bushings lately, now is the perfect 
time.
