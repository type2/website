Subject: Plastic Nut Dampers?

The Bently says there are plastic nut dampers.  My oil pump had some of
these, red plastic doodies.  Bently and Muir say to place the plastic
part to the OUTSIDE.  That's not how it was when I took it off.  Is the
purpose to seal off oil, or keep them from vibrating loose?

TIA,
Robert
