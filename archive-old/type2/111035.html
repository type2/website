I have a 69 bus that the brake lights and turn signals just stopped working.
I replaced both tail light assemblies and replaced fuses.
Any other ideas?

Dustin,

did the light stop working AFTER you replaced the tail light
assemblies &amp; fuses or before?

either way, i would tend to look at the obvious first.
check to make sure you are getting current and make
sure the grounds are good.

good luck,
