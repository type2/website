Subject: Stainless steel mufflers

Hi folks,

Just an FYI--SoCal Imports is now selling a stainless steel TYPE I muffler
(2 tailpipe outlets) for $99.95 (made in Denmark).  Unfortunately, I just
spoke with a SoCal representative and he said that the bus version is not
available in SS.   I haven't contacted the UK company Ken was dealing with
last year that had the tooling to make the SS bus mufflers--don't know if
there is any connection.

To use the bug muffler on the bus AND avoid the issue of the exhaust fumes
lingering in the dead air space behind the bus and finding their way into
the interior (as is the case when a bug muffler is used on a bus without
modification), I'm wondering if there would be any problem with sealing off
one of the outlets and using the bus damper pipe and hardware (or fab SS
equivalents) on the other to achieve the stock back pressure.  This is
assuming that the internal baffling in the bus &amp; bug mufflers are the same
and that the only difference is one outlet verus two (haven't cut stock
mufflers open to compare yet).  The SoCal guy claimed that the stainless
steel version was identical to stock (pre-heater boxes included), but I
didn't verify that the heat riser tube routing was correct, nor do I know if
the heat riser tube is set up like the Brazilian or the German muffler (both
are OEM, but the pipe is in a different location for each).

If anyone has already researched or purchased this muffler and has comments
on the quality and fit, I'd like to hear them.  

SoCal Imports # is 562-633-9731.
