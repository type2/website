Seems like as good as time any any to relate the *towing report* saga 
to the enquiring minds that want to know (or was that NO!) Oh well.
This all occurred during the 400 mile round trip towing trip to 
rescue my 2nd '80 Westi from Grass Valley to Palo Alto California
(for the geographically uninformed the foothills of the Sierras to 
south of San Francisco and back)
Not much to report of in terms of VW sightings, but lots of burning 
vehicle excitement.  Near the pass after Altamount pass going over the 
coast range traffic was backed up while emergency fire crews were 
responding to a grass fire on the side of the road.  Time passed and 
we came to the start of the grass fire, a 'merican type van totally 
burned, started at the front (engine) end.  Driver had stopped next 
to a two posted signs built with 4x4's.  Nearby post was a sliver of 
the original and the second was badly scorched.  Enough heat was 
generated to fry the sign and start the grass afire.  10 acres later 
the fire crews finally put it out.

On the way home, with the Westi in tow, near Roseville was a Camaro 
type car with the engine on fire.  Fire crews not yet in sight.

It ain't only VW's that ignite ! ! !
Carry protection, move to an accessible location whenever working on 
fuel system.

I have seen several car fires along the road up to the Sierra's with 
none of them being VW's and most of them starting grass fires nearby.

&gt; done, my mechanic HAD an extinguisher!).  My daughter does not carryone.
&gt; After all, she drives a Merc Topaz, safe, reliable, etc...  Last week the
&gt; distrib caught fire, and before the fire dept arrived, every single piece of
&gt; rubber and plastic under that hood had melted or burned to ash.  You DO NOT
&gt; have to drive a veedub for this bit of equipment to be an invaluable part of
&gt; your tool kit.  It could have saved her ride.
