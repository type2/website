I hate to disagree with Alan but in his last mail he said:-

&gt;Hi Garp
&gt;OK, I agree with your mechanic about going to back to &gt;stock. After 20 K
your
&gt;bottom end should be OK so I'd concentrate on the &gt;problem at hand.

If they happily used Araldite &amp; a checkers piece, how can you assume that
you bottom end is fine? I wonder if even your first guy is being TOTALLY
honest. Do you belong to any clubs? Can you get another opinion? Something
smells distinctly of fish to me! Where is the engine now? In the bus? If so
how can he be certain it's the rings, why not valve train? Changing
EVERYTHING like he wants will only through the baby out with the bath water,
that's when you get the old &quot;I found some good s/hand heads for you&quot; &amp; back
go your heads!

Call me if you want to go into more detail; with a disabled wife, 1 kid &amp;
another on it's way I know what your going through right now.

Andrew
