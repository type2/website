&gt; 1. Do all 81 Vanagons have fresh air blowers and 80's not?

&gt; thing?

Al,

Today, I wen to a junkyard here that had not one, but two '80 Vanagons!
Both Powder Blue.  Both had the metal air intakes that I have been told
were '80 only (didn't check VIN's, sorry)

One was a Westy, with poptop but without propane, stove, or fridge.  It
did have a sink and icebox.  In addition it did have a &quot;glove box&quot; and fan
switch on the heater panel.  Now, the Vanagon glove box is a bin that
flips out and back, not a pocket with a door like on the bay window era,
check?

The second Vanagon was a 7-passenger and had neither fan switch nor glove
box, just a molded parcel shelf.

So I guess the answer to your question is that it depends on what trim
level you bought.

Further thoughts: Maybe it depends on whether you bought a Westy or a
passenger van.  One other thing I just thought of as I sit here at home
(too late, dammit)  is that I did not check the Westy for a gas heater
switch.  My '80 has both the fan and glove box but it does have the BA-6
as well.  It makes sense that to include the fan in a vehicle equipped
with a &quot;stationary heater.&quot;
