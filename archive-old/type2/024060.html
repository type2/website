Subject: Hot, hot, hot!

Gentlepersons-
                       In the middle of a heat wave here (yesterday, 105 F :-(
and I decided to give my engine as much help as possible. I tucked a 6 in.
aluminum round duct up the left side air vent and plastic wire-tied the 
other end at the fan to give it first dibs on the &quot;cooler&quot; air. An unscien-
tific dipstick touch test seemed to give slightly cooler results on a with
and without two way run with my 2L...YMMV...
