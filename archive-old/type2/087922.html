Subject: 69 and 71, transmission changes

Hello, T2 friends!
  I have a question for you.=20
  Will a 69 transmission work in a '71 bus? both use the same CV joint =
and axle, of course. I am only aware of a change to the clutch style. =
'69 transmission has a round, tubular housing over the spline and will =
not accept a diaphragm type clutch pressure plate. It must use the =
three-finger type. Other than that, is anyone aware of any differences, =
and also will the '71 shift tube work with the '69 transmission? For =
example, is the transmission mount the same? TIA.. Jan B
