Subject: vibration dampers for Bus engine

Hello - I ordered a set of 6 &quot;Vibration Dampers&quot; for my 79 bus (78 FI
engine, 72-74 exhaust) as I have some noises from the back I've not been
able to isolate (a heavy, rather hollow metallic knocking when going over
bumps - like a detached shock banging against the chassis - but my shocks
are new and securely installed - noise started several weeks after shocks
were installed). I am unable to find clear info on exactly where these
dampers go beyond  &quot;somewhere on the engine&quot;. They are 6 roughly half inch
 plastic cylinders grooved lengthwise on the outside. I have read the
type2 library article Rear Motor Mount Replacement ('72-'79 Type 2) by
Dennis Jolliffe (a.k.a. Denmeister) and David Schwarze, and it seems to me
that perhaps these might fit into that procedure somewhere, but I am
unsure. Even if these are not the cause of the noise (I doubt they are,
actually) I feel I should probably replace them as things that dampen
vibrations tend to wear out, and tend to be important... Any guidance on
these dampers or other possible causes of knocking from rear over bumps
greatly appreciated.
