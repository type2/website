Subject: Re: [T2] Parking Brake is now sticking

Hi Anton,

How long has it been sitting in one spot? If my bus sits more than a  
week in damp weather with the parking brake on, sometimes the shoes  
rust to the drum. In order to get rolling I have to dump the clutch  
in first gear or reverse.

When buying a used car that has sat for a while, sometimes I find  
that this doesn't work either. In that case it usually helps to hit  
the drum with a hammer as the driver is letting the clutch out. It  
usually lets go with a bang, after which everything works just fine.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Volks,

&gt; After lube-ing up everything nicely underneath our 69 Westy while  
&gt; on the rack, it has just today decided to start keeping the parking  
&gt; brakes ON even after releasing the handle.
&gt;
&gt; My father-in-law did squirt some liquid wrench on those lines for  
&gt; good measure, which made the operation smoother, but today when I  
&gt; went to get some tacos the car would barely move off on its own  
&gt; after releasing the parking brake.
&gt;
&gt; What should I look for?
