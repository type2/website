Hello all,

  Here in central South Carolina I know a man who has several split =
window and &quot;newer&quot; buses that he would sell or part out.  He is very =
upright and honest.  He also has a billion bugs.  If anyone is =
interested.  He told me it was fine to give folks his name and number. =20

  This man has been collecting bugs, things, pick-ups, buses, basically =
whatever VW put out.  For decades.  He rebuilds and restores.  Attends =
shows too.  You will not find a nicer or more knowledgeable fella.  When =
he works on anything he does it right and makes it perfect as humanly =
possible.

  It rather amusing to be taken on a tour of his domain.  Some of the =
vehicles have been there so long they have trees growing through them!

  I hope I have not over-stepped my bounds by posting this information.  =
But he may have something that someone else cannot find!

Jennifer of South Carolina
