Subject: Oil temp gauge install

I finally got round to wiring up my gauges today (VDO volts, oil pressure &amp;
oil temp).  I ran the engine for a few minutes (until the chokes came off
basically) and all seems well except that the temp gauge hardly moved off
the peg.  Is this to be expected?  (i.e. Would the oil not have got hot
enough?)  The resistance at the sender (sump sender) was reading about 300
ohms and rising after I shut the engine down, which is consistent with the
bottom end of the range according to the gauge.  I assume the resistance is
supposed to go down as the temperature rises?
