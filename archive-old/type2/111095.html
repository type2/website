&gt; Can anyone suggest a sealant for these full flow oil fittings.

Jack, When I have worked on oil fittings (although usually not in the
Vw arena) I use a product developed by loctite. It's not the green
stuff but instead a hydraulic sealant. I figure if it's good enough to
keep 8000 psi thin hydraulic oil from leaking it outta work w/ motor
oil at much lower pressures. I don't have the number, but you should
be able to just ask for the hydraulic sealant. The few times I have
used it on engines I have had good results. It seals well &amp; will break
loose easily.
