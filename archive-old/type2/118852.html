Subject: vacuum leak in brake booster

Hi volks

 I posted a problem recently about my FI 1800 and the concencus was that my
problem was a vacuum leak.
Well, after much messing around and tail chasing here is what I found.
If I removed the brake booster vacuum line at the intake and plugged the
opening the engine runs great.
So I replaced the old and cracked hose that runs from the engine to the steel
tube(that runs up to the front of the van). I thought for sure this would do
it but no!!!!!
Then I checked the line at the brake booster by removing it and plugging it
with a spark plug.
Problem solved .
So now I have my vacuum leak isolated to my brake booster and I believe it is
caused by water accumulating in the booster and then freezing, hence expanding
and warping the diaphragm or otherwise damaging the booster.(this problem
presented itself after a long cold snap)

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen or am I barking up the wrong
tree.
My faith is shaken here because I thought I had found my problem a couple
times but was wrong on each occasion(manifold gaskets, aux air regulator
ETC.)

Thanks in advance
