Hello All,
 I have two VW Busses for sale.

 The first is a 1970 with pop-top and a Z-bed, 1600dp, doghouse cooler,
Alternator, heater assist blower, good int, straight body new nylon
boot for pop-top, good tires, new front brakes, 35K on motor. This Bus
runs great and is driven everyday, passed Wa. State Emission Test just
two or three months ago. Need paint. Good clutch, new plugs, good heat
exchangers. $900 O.B.O

The second is a 73 with sunroof. Has a 2.0l with Weber carb, tires are
O.K. body is real nice no rust and minor dents, decent paint. Engine
runs, but needs some work low comp on #3. Auto trans, good glass. I am
selling this bus whole or parting it out. $300 O.B.O.

Both Busses are in Graham Wa. Near Tacoma. My phone # is
(253)-846-2004. I really need to sell at least one, so give me a call I
am very motivated to sell. I listed them once, but have decided to part
out the 73 if anyone needs parts, make me an offer on anything you
want.
