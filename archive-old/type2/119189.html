Subject: [T2] Can't get a spark???


&gt; I have recently installed a new longblock.  I labeled
&gt; all the wires and didn't have any missing wires when i
&gt; connected them back up.  The gear drive was in the
&gt; correct place when i recieved the engine and it was
&gt; test run before being shipped, so i know i put that
&gt; in.  But when i go to start it just turns and turns.
&gt; The fuel pump sounds like it was pumping.  What else
&gt; should I check to figure out why it wont start. Maybe
&gt; its not the spark?

Have you pulled a spark plug wire while cranking to see that you are, in
fact, getting a spark?  Also, it doesn't hurt to double check that the
distributor drive gear is, in fact, correctly installed.

&gt; A few sidenotes, 1: I have a CA 83 Vanagon, 2: I
&gt; pulled one of the spark plugs and it looks dry and
&gt; fine - would it be wet with gas if it was sparking but
&gt; not gas was getting in there?

Having just gone through a similar problem with my recently-installed engine
in the Westfalia I'd say it's not completely obvious by looking at the plugs
whether you're getting gas.  I pulled a plug after the &quot;crank/no start&quot;
event and it was *not* obviously wet with gas.  Just to make doubly sure gas
*wasn't* my problem I installed a fuel pressure gauge on the fuel ring to
ensure I was getting gas to the engine.

&gt; 3:  when origninally
&gt; tightening down the starter the plastic on the
&gt; celonoid snapped, but i took it to a repair shop and
&gt; they put on a new cover and it seems to be working -
&gt; what do the two slide on wires go to and could that be
&gt; the problem - i'm pretty sure one is for the fuel pump
&gt; and it sounds like it is pumping, but what does the
&gt; other one go to.

The red and blue/brown wire both run over the the fuel pump relay.
