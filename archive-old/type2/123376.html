Subject: Re: Insanely Cheap Exhaust

What is the difference between the glass pack and quiet pack? And why would
it matter what your bus has now?

And finally...orders on Sunday only seems a bit strange?

What do you guys think? Other than those questions, I would like a new
muffler for those prices :-)
