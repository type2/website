&gt; Where would I find original owners manuals for my 1971 Westfalia?

Try 1-800-544-8021  I just received a mailing from VWoA Spring 2000 Service
Publications Index and they list original manuals from 1972 forward but
maybe a call will dig up one that they did not have enough of to list in the
index.  Just a thought!
