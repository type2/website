Subject: Re:  Fw: [T2] sliding door started what year??

Hi, Fred S sent me this from the type2 list:
.......
I know this is pretty much a vintage page question but I also feel we all
stick together regardless of year.  Air cooled stick together that is.

Now for the question.  The 65 I just picked up has a sliding door and all
the ones I've had in the past have been double doors.  Are the parts and
maintenance the same as the later model sliding door buses?

The undercarriage is immaculate and I'm looking forward to parking this bad
boy beside the Westy (76)  as soon as it is ready.

Peace Out

yes this is pretty unusual.   Real unusual here in the USA, where I have only 
seen 3 of them (2 were identical 64 standards with sliding sunroofs that I 
saw 500 miles apart, the other was an SO-1 food vendors van with one side 
having the lift up sales flap, the sliding door was on the drivers side, all 
three were Euro-spec buses brought over by individuals), In Europe it was an 
option taken more often.   Saw a nice 63 velvet green panel with sliding 
doors both sides, and couple double slider sunroof deluxes, and several 
others with the slider on one side there.  Have seen NOS splitty sliding door 
handle and parts there at a reasonable price at the VW meets.   But when 
would I use such a thing?    The sliding door was an option 63-67.  No the 
sliding door parts are not the same as the 68-79 sliding doors, at least a 
number of them.      If your bus is not a panel van, one of the windows in 
the sliding door is unique.   

Have fun with the new bus!!!!
