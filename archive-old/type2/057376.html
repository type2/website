Subject: Re: Bob Hoover's Sermons - Please kill this thread!

Ladies, Gentlemen,

As Thom said, it's over.  Please don't post on this subject.  I, along
with the the vast majority of you, am incredibly saddened that it had to
come to this, but Mr. Hoover is the owner of his ideas, and their
disposition is entirely up to him.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
