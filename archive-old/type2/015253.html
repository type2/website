&gt;How is the parts place called &quot;Busboys&quot; (found 'em surfing the web)
&gt;to deal with?

Lately, I've bought a LOT of stuff from them, mainly because I grew
frustrated with another Bus place which I will not mention.  I don't know
the guy's name, maybe he is the owner, but everytime I call, I get him.  He
is SUPER nice and all of the parts have shipped promptly.  I will buy from
him again.

YMMV
