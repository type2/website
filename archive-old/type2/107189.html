Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB] longblock first start

Well I hope that 'dry' doesnt mean no assy lube at all but this is from
past experience and it worked for Jasons engine just the same.



&gt; This might be a stupid question, but who in their right mind would assemble a motor dry? Worse case for me is motor oil, then start up right away and install. Second method is assembly lube if I plan on putting the short block on the shelf for awhile. Seems like an awfully expensive way to tear up a set of bearings. Why don't you just hit them with some 120 grit sand paper before installing them? Hmmm
&gt;
&gt; Tidbit....
&gt; If assembled dry the oil pump can fail to prime itself.
&gt; Solution is to prime it by squirting oil in the sender hole
&gt; (and maybe turning backward and squirting more).
