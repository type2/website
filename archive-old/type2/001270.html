X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

A few months ago I posted a note about our '72 Bus tossing the alternator
belt.  We've had the bus for over 3 years and never had a problem with the
belt until then.  Once it threw the belt, new ones would not stay on for
more
than 15-20 miles.  Fortunately we could drive for a few miles without a belt
if
needed.

Anyway, I finally decided to solve the mystery and discovered the alternator
pulley was not lined up with the crank pulley, but I never touched it!  I
yanked
the alt pulley off and re-installed it the other way around (so it sat
closer to the
alternator) and then the pulleys lined up.  So far, so good.

It's just strange that it worked so well for 2.5 years with misaligned
pulleys.
