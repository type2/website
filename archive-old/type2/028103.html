I think that's $1000 in parts; you supply the labor. It won't necessarily cost that much, but it can easily get that high...heads: ~250 each, exhaust: ~200 ...yada, yada, yada.

I'd pass with it that far away. If I was going to gamble, I'd shoot for one of those $1000 buses with problems...especially since you're missing some camper stuff.

Good luck! Joe
