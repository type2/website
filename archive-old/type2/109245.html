&gt; I pulled my engine may times in the last year alone.  It is a 73, pancake.
&gt; It is a type two, not identical to the type 4.  It is not so difficult and
I
&gt; have done it alone although I always fetched help to put it back.

Andrea-
Let's shine a little more light here.
Your engine is a type 4, your bus is a type 2. OK ?
As long as you are here, let's tell the boys what
you have accomplished with the engine out !
