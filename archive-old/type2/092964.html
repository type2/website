Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters


&gt;now to relate to the site, I have for a number of years been trying to
&gt;figure out a decent way to make a voltswagen (yes I know about the school
&gt;teacher in new england, but I don't have his budget) the hybrid design is
&gt;attractive.   consider
&gt;
&gt;a 1200 or 1300 vw engine, through a hybrid drive, driving a Bus at 70mph
&gt;all day????  I think it is doable...

Yahoo hosts a couple of EV lists and they offer good advice on how to mate 
a large electric motor to the transaxle, batteries, controllers, and 
charging. I lurk on the list. Certainly not difficult.

A feasible solution would be late model small displacement engine used as a 
generator complete with air pollution controls to keep the batteries 
charged. Maybe a small displacement 1000cc water cooled motorcycle engine. 
With fuel injection and a catalytic converter.
