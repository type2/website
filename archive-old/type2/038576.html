Mike,
I've been running a pair of Michelin MX's on my 70 235 Kombi for the past 2
years.  After 16,000 miles, they still look like new and handle like a
dream!
The rear tires are finally ready to be replaced and I'll be getting another
pair
of MX's for the Kombi.  I had chosen these tires due to their being designed
for the heavier Vanagon.  I figured if they will work safely on a Vanagon,
they
would be just fine for my Kombi.

I'd be interested to hear what others have to say about the weight issues
and
how that is calculated as well.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Geez, I just purchased a new set of tires for my '79 Westy.  I thought I
&gt;did my homework and eventually decided on a full set of 185R14 Michelin MX
&gt;6ply reinforced tires with a load/speed rating of 94R (1540lbs.)  I
&gt;must've called a dozen places trying to find a deal.  Best price I found
&gt;was $90ea (installed).  Other tire considerations were the usual suspects,
&gt;Bridgestone 603V ($10 cheaper) and Yokohama 356 (couldn't find around
&gt;here.)  Guess I went with the Michelin because of the name and the
&gt;recommendations from mechanics and FLAPS folks.
&gt;
&gt;But now am I to assume that these are not up to spec?

&gt;&gt;  You shouldn't fit a tyre to a bus that has a number less than 95
&gt;&gt; and that's the absolute bare minimum (1520lbs). To do so is akin
&gt;&gt; to fitting S-rated (112mph) tyres to a 150mph Mustang: they arn't
&gt;&gt; up to the job, are illegal and dangerous.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  To get acceptable handling most listees recommend at least a 97
&gt;&gt; load index (roughly equivalent to a six-ply rating) which equates
&gt;&gt; to 1609lbs, to be honest 99 (1709lbs) or so works better. This is
&gt;&gt; in the vicinity of an &quot;eight ply rating&quot; tyre. If you push up into
&gt;&gt; &quot;load range D&quot; territory then you are looking at 100/102 load
&gt;&gt; indices (max load about 1800lbs) and you start to trade a firm
&gt;&gt; ride against more stability (ie not if you have a bad back!!).
&gt;
&gt;Where did you get these figures?  I searched through the archives for tire
&gt;info and didn't find any specs this demanding.  Most tire dealers I spoke
&gt;with said the reinforced MX was made specially for Vanagons; most also
&gt;did not stock these tires and had to place a special order.
&gt;
&gt;Since we're on the subject... what exactly does it mean to have a load
&gt;rating of say, 1540lbs?  Does that mean 4 tires with that load rating can
&gt;support 4 x 1540lbs?  Or is this per axle?
&gt;
&gt;I don't have the owner's manual for the Westy... anyone know the weight of
&gt;one of these?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I've had these Michelins for a week and have been very happy.  Oh,
&gt;she handles like a dream!  Can't wait to see how gas milage improves.
&gt;Although... anything would have been an improvement over the
&gt;cracked and balding old Yokohamas I used to have!
