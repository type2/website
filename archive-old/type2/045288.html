Roofing tar.  maybe people are afraid/leery of it, but it has done me right.

&lt;&lt; Everyone:
 
 Someone mentioned a while back that there is something you can buy to put on 
 widow seals to make them seal better. I thought it was described as being a 
 tar-like substance that stays flexible.
 
 I was driving to work the other day and it started raining. I think the 
 water built up under the windshield seal because it let loose all at once. 
 Water poured down the dash and onto my legs.
 
 The seal looks good, but it doesn't seem to be working.
 
 Thanks, &gt;&gt;
