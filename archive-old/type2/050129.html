Subject: Re: [T2] CV Boot replacement

I've had good luck with Rockford boots.  Two years and no visible
cracking.  Much better than the Lobro and Qualitat boots I tried
previously.

One caution:  the rockford boots are a modern design, without the
accordian convolutions of the originals.  The axle end of the boot should
be placed outboard (toward the CV) of the locating &quot;lumps&quot; on the axle,
instead of between the lumps.
Otherwise you will stretch the rubber too much at full extension of the
suspension.

And, of course, YMMV!
