&gt;Does anyone have a name/part number for pushrod tube seals for a '76 2liter? 
&gt;  I'd like to pick them up locally(Atlanta area) and tackle this job this 
&gt;weekend.  They don't even have to be Viton, as anything is better than what 
&gt;is there now.  Thanks much.

021 109 345A - small end
021 109 349B - large end

You need 8 eight of each. Viton would last longer (it will be green or brown in appearance compared to black/orange for the regular seals).
