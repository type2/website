This has happened to me twice.  Both times it was blowby from a burnt
piston, which was pressurizing the crankcase and blowing the oil out the
breather.  Not a lovely sight.  My advice is pull the engine, tear it
down and look for it.  This all-of-a-sudden oil leak is probably the
death rattle of the engine.

Sorry to be so cheerful about this!  HTH. . . :&lt;)

&gt; Help, started my bus yesterday morning (15 degrees out) and started driving
&gt; down the road as a noxious smell started coming out the heater.  Looked out
&gt; the rear view mirror and saw smoke bellowing out the back.  Stopped, grabbed
&gt; the extinguisher and opened the engine door to find thankfully no fire, but
&gt; oil all over the rear of the engine, on the cooling assembly, belts, generator
&gt; etc.  Also oil was dripping down below onto the ground.  No other signs of oil
&gt; leaks anywhere.  So far I can't find out where its coming from (the plastic
&gt; piece holding the dipstick is cracked but I don't think this is new) Anybody
&gt; experience this before or anyone have any ideas?
