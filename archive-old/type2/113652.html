Subject: Re: [T2] VW crash testing?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He was going about 20 MPH and was hit by a drunk going about 35 MPH in a
&gt; &gt; big American car.  Severely fractured his left leg in several places.
&gt;
&gt;This picture is sobering and makes me accept 65 mph is more than fast enough
&gt;for me in my 32 year old rolling sardine can.

Ummm - yeah....
