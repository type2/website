Subject: heat, air conditioning, etc.

Insulated more this weekend- found a huge hole in the heater pipe where it
converges from the heater boxes (?) into one pipe.  Stuffed the holes that
go into the passenger area, also, so this should help, I hope.

While I was under there I couldn't help but notice (it was in my way and
cut me a couple of times) a big flat thing that I'm assuming had something
to do with the after-market air conditioning that used to be in the bus.  I
was going to just take it off, but I couldn't follow all the tubes coming
out and going into it (bus wasn't up on anything, therefore I was pretty
cramped and it was hard to get around under there) and I figured I'd better
ask first...  Also, there's another one up front- can I take both of these
things off?  They look sort of like radiators or condensors or somethign of
that nature.  Took pictures, but not developed until Wednesday.

Switched my license plates/registration to Wisconsin.  Personalized license
plates are RMBLE ON.  Led Zeppelin reference, plus a neat bus thing anyway.
Anyone else have cool personalzed license plates?  HEre come all the MY
BUS  and '78 BUS -right?  :)
