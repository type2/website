Subject: Bob Hoovers Sersmons

I'm new to driving, new to cars, and especially new to VW's, the Hoover Sermons
were at least half the reason I decided that I (a computer geek who'd barely 
ever touched a socket wrench) could acquire, maintain, and cherish the not one
but two busses I now own.  I never mailed him to say thank you, assuming that
he was busy answering everyone elses questions.  Now I feel bad that I didn't!
I'd definately buy a Hoover Book or CD-Rom, or even pay for access to the
material thats on the web.  Barely a day goes by when I'm not into those
sermons trying to figure out what I need to fix on my busses next.  I'm sure
I'll be able to live without them, but man, it's going to be a LOT harder!
