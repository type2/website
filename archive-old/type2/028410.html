All, I have some older distant relatives with a VW powered caravan sort of
thing. The cab is a type2 and the rest is pure caravan park. I havnt seen it
in a while but I remember the inside was very neatly done. Anyway, it looks
like they wont need it anymore. Is this a rare thing or some local
conversion? Whatever, is it worth having as a VW variation, oh yes, it has
autovilla on the front of the caravan bit.
