Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel over tranny

Bart,

No problem...except getting explosive stuff spread around.

That was last Tuesday or so wasn't it?  Surely all of it has pretty much 
evaporated by now.  No problem on the tranny.

If gas could get inside, then so could water...and it's not gonna happen 
unless you have some other serious tranny problem...like a hole in the 
tranny.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I had this fuel leak I told you about. When trying to drain the fuel tank, a
 huge amount of fuel ran over the right side of the tranny. Can this do some
&gt; harm? Can the fuel be mixed with the oil in the tranny - which I refreshed
 two weeks ago...
 The tranny now shines like new anyway ;-)
