&gt; from what I can put together, the highroof was towing a SC w/ cargo box on it. 4-5 people in the lead vehicle, both loaded with stuff from octo/classic.

&gt; As David S. pointed out, how fast could they have been going? Perhaps 35?

depends on the road and conditions, it could have been crusing at 50-55 if
they had long enough to get up to speed

&gt; If the trucker was doing 10 miles over the maximum (65max for trucks?) 
&gt; and the buses were going 15 under the minimum 
&gt; (yes there is one)
&gt; who's at fault?

were they in the slow lane?  were the tail lights working???
15mph UNDER the limit in the slow lane is legal
10mph OVER the limit is illegal what else can be said

it is one of those things like the sail boat cutting in front of an
aircraft carrier, yes they have the right of way, but they are just as
sunk.

wonder what would be a good warninng on the towed vehicle, flashing yellow
light??  around here schoolbuses have strobes flashing on the roofs so
they are seen....might be worth getting a yellow strobe and putting it in
my van, also get moving on the LED taillight project too!
