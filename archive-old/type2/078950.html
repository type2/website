&gt; Hey folks- I've p-mailed a couple of you and thought I'd ask the list in 
&gt; general (at least the NJ residences).
&gt; 
&gt; My '77 just failed safety inspection due to the rust (&quot;no sharp edges 
&gt; allowed&quot;) and because my front seat springs/frame is poking through.  Short 
&gt; of having the rust fixed and replacing my front seats, the bus will never 
&gt; pass inspection.

buy some seat covers, cheap ones at your local FLAPS if you plan on fixing
or replacing the seats, nice ones if you plan on sitting on em a while.

for the rust.  get some metal tape (used in home building, insulation tape
or some such name)  cover the bad spots smoothly then paint with primer
and a close match color....     later do it right
&gt; 
&gt; The only options I can think of is to find a more sympathetic garage 

that works too, 

Bob
