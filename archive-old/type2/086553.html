Subject: Re: [T2] strange yellow gunk?

I drive only 20 miles back and forth to work, and I always have that gunk in
this bus. Cold for me means around 40, maybe 30 at night. =)

The question I have is, is this bad? Or no worries, keep on truckin?

&gt; Well, since my first step was to search the archives &amp; i didn't find
&gt; anything there, here is the answer for that particular question. Many
&gt; thanks to those who answered.
&gt;
&gt; It's condensation &amp; oil combined. Cause: not getting the engine hot
&gt; enough, for long enough.
&gt;
&gt; What puzzles me is I drive 1 hour each way to work and back. 30
&gt; minutes interstate driving at 65-70. It has been cold here lately, but
&gt; I'm sure some of you laugh at what i call cold (10-25 degrees F). I
&gt; plan on checking the thermostat out. The flaps are set correctly and
&gt; it's a new t'stat, but it might not be totally usefull. I'll have to
&gt; check myself. Any other obvious thoughts on getting the temp up, or is
&gt; 1 hour just not enough. TIA
&gt;
&gt;
