&gt;purpose of this insulation?
&gt;I left mine off thinking it was for cooling
&gt;the engine better, does anyone know for sure?

For sure?  Not me.  I have never seen the jacketing even mentioned in
any manual, much less its purpose explained.

I have surmised that it is a combination of keeping heat in the pipes,
which makes the exhaust gases flow better, and keeping the heat out of
the cylinder areas.  On catalyst and/or O2 sensor equipped buses, I
suppose it could also serve to keep the exhaust warm for when it hits
the converter and/or O2 sensor.
