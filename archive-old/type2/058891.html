Hello -
Hopefully this will be considered appropriate for the list.  Anyway, I'm
gonna be driving my bus from Portland, Oregon south to the U.S./Mexico
border (and beyond) soon, and in case of trouble on the road was wondering
if anyone could recommend any reputable VW shops/mechanics along the way
down and back between Portland and San Diego.  Will most likely be going
down I5 until Grants Pass OR, cutting over to Hwy 101 thru Crescent City
CA, and taking 101 down thru San Franciso/San Jose southbound, and then
probably up I5 all the way back north.  Hopefully I won't need the info,
but it will help me in the &quot;peace of mind&quot; department.  I appreciate any
recommendations you can make.  Thanks in advance...
