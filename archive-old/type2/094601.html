Subject: Used Mexican Bus?

Howdy folks.
My girlfriend and i are talking about driving around mexico someday in a =
bus, but instead of bringing mine all the way down (not as far as for =
some, we're in New Orleans) we were wondering if it were feasable to buy =
one there, drive it around, then sell it there. Any idea what busses go =
for down there? Comparative prices to here? Cheaper? More expensive? If =
a new Brazilian is $8000 then maybe a 30 year old used in Mexico might =
be cheap? Any legal issues involved?
Thanks
Wink
