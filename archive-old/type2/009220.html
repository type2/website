worth it

I find Bus Depot's service to be excellent, but I make it a policy
never to order parts from afar when time is tight.  To do so will get
you disappointed sooner or later no matter what supplier you use.

We have become used to instant everything, so quality has gone by the
wayside.  I doubt that the heat exchangers you get from RMMW are
nearly as good as the ones from Bus Depot, for example.

Perhaps a flashback to the great-grandaddy of mail-order auto parts is
in order.  JC Whitney used to guarantee delivery of your order within
6 weeks and would usually have it to you in a blazing month!
