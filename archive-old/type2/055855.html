Well,
It has been almost a year since I purchased my latest project, a '64
Campmobile. (It says Campmobile on the sink so until I find out
different, which I won't spend my time to do, that is what I will call
it.) It has a fresh rebuild, good brakes, a '67 tranny &amp; working fuel
guage, and enough extra parts to fill the interior. So we moved right
after purchase and unfortunatly, the new garage was not as nice as the
old one. In haste, we put lots of stuff in there so putting a vehicle in
was out of the question. Well I have been working for the past couple of
weeks getting the garage ready, and today I was able to introduce my bus
to its new home. Yes, I call it a home because it will be a while before
it comes out. The bus is in need of some body work, of which I am going
to attempt myself. If you are wondering what took me so long, I have a
new job teaching and a young family that take up most of my time. Anyway
that's my moral victory story.
