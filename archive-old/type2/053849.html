&gt; HELP!
&gt;
&gt; What could make my spark advance run on out to 50 degrees?
&gt;
&gt; It seemed to happen slowly, and at first I thought it was the points, so I
put
&gt; in new ones but no change. I started using premium and retarded the dist
until I
&gt; could find a dist, and just put in a rebuilt one today. I did not replace
the
&gt; dual vac advance because it seemed fine, moving the plate and holding
vaccume.

Is this a dual vacuum distributor??
A 76 2.0 should use a single vacuum advance distributor.


&gt; All of the vaccume lines and elec. plugs look great.
&gt;
&gt; The book says 7.5 degrees BTDC, but I have it set now at 8 degrees ATDC to
bring
&gt; the advance to 32 at 3000 rpms.

7.5 WITH a single vacuum unit.
5 or 10 AFTER with a dual vacuum unit depending on the distributor # you
have.
You have to have vacuum at idle at the retard side of the dual unit.

This is a prime example of why you do NOT time an engine by the year of the
engine when you have mis-matched parts. You time it by the distributor
number you are using.

If you have a 76 with the single unit distributor....you would have 38 to 43
degrees total advance. 32 is NOT enough total advance.

&gt; It is a '73 engine in a '76 with FI.

What is the number on the distributor you are using and is it a single or
dual vacuum unit?
