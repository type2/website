Subject: Something Dripping oil ... what is it ?

Well, I know this sounds like the start of a joke but its not &lt;grin&gt;

I have had this one irritating oil leak that until recently I was 
unsure of where it was coming from, now I have found it but I have no 
idea what the thing is that the hose its leaking from is sticking out 
of ! (I apologize for that poorly worded sentence)

On my 1973 1700 if I look on the passenger side of the engine beneath 
the right lower coverplate where the thermostat is there is this 
&quot;thing&quot; just forward (towards the transmission/front of the bus) with a 
hose going into it from the one side and one coming out attached to 
.... nothing ... now it would appear that the PO has put a screw in 
this unattached hose and there is oil coming out from around the screw 
and until now onto the coverplate and then onto my 
driveway/garage/neighborhood.

What is this thing with the hoses ? Why is this one hose plugged with a 
screw and not attached ? From what I can figure from seeing some shots 
of it indirectly in a couple thermostat pictures it doesn't attach to 
anything and the hose is unplugged ....

Well, any and all help in figuring out what this thing is and why its 
dribbling oil would be appreciated... if my description isn't apt I 
will post pics.

Thanks,
