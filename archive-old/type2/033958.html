Subject: winter storage in Mass

Hello all,
    Does anyone know of any place, (barns, garages, anything) where I could
store my westy in central or western Massachusettes.  My goals for storage
are that it costs me less then a good car cover ($250-300) for four months
of storage, and that it is dry.  It does not need to be heated, and access
would be nice, so that I could start her up every few weeks.  I'll be living
in Northampton come January, so anything in the valley would be ideal.
Thanks all, and have a happy holiday season.

Peace, Love and a Plethora of Good Grooves,
Aaron (=
'80 westy &quot;Sunshine&quot;
