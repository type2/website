Hello all,

 Well, I posted another view of the 73 and it is still for sale. The current
asking price is $2500 and is located in Midwest City, Oklahoma.

The pics are at:  my.treeway_dot_com/OKArt/

The pic of the 82 was stolen from www.vanagon_dot_com since I haven't got any to
scan yet. If anyone in the OKC area wants to help, I'm going to pull the
engine soon to get the # 3 valve seat fixed!!!
