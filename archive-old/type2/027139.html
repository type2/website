Subject: contributing to the heat?

As I track down all the factors contributing to the heat in my stock 1600dp 
engine, something finally glared me right in the face.  I don't have the 
stock air filter right now.  It's just this chromed p.o.s. 5&quot; paper thing 
like the hot rods run.  The carb is sucking air right from the hot engine 
bay that I have been trying desperately to seal.  The builder put this air 
filter on and put the grimy, sludgey oil bath air cleaner in a box for me.  
So, I'm going to install it tomorrow.  Do I point the fresh air inlet into 
the airflow from the side vent, above the battery?  Would it help to attach 
a snorkel and run it up the quarter panel closer to the vent openning or is 
the stock set up sufficient?  There is a diverter flap that's got a return 
spring and I'm not sure how to hook this up either.  I assume it's heat 
activated but where does the hot air come from?  Teed into the shroud heater 
tube?  Can I block off the hot side in the Summer and then go back to the 
paper filter in the Winter?
