nah... two year ('72 as well). Ron seems to carry the parts for the early
disk brakes, so they are out there, but the later brakes would probably be
easier to find locally.

&gt; Side effect is that you will have the small five bolt pattern on the front
&gt; and still have the old wide five bolt pattern on the rear.  You have
&gt; to decide which spare to carry.

I have not owned a '68-70, but I am curious about the rears.  how much do
you have to change to get the later composite drums on there? I see the
shoes have different part #s, are the backing plates different? spring
settup? rear trailing arm? splines/length of the stub axle?  Anyone tried
this?
