Subject: dirty brake fluid twin-reservoir

A while ago I jumped on the busdepot's special deal for new German master
cylinders. No particular reason except that the old one is close to 25 years
old and that I was working on the brakes anyway (brake fluid had leaked out
of *both* rear drums! - what a mess.).

Anyway, yesterday I pulled the MC while the turkey was in the oven and to my
dismay I found that the twin reservoir contained a thick, black, liquid, not
unlike ink... :(

(1) Any ideas as to where this came from? (Say, from the black hose that
connects the refill reservoir under the driver's seat to the
twin-reservoir?)

(2) Any suggestions as to how I can effectively clean up the inside? (I
sprayed some brake cleaner in there and had more black stuff come out, but
it's not very effective.)

Thanks,

Sami
