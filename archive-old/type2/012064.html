Sam,

I have a heater booster fan in both my bus's and they
make a huge difference.  Its really nice in my 77
westy, as i've got the blower in engine compartment
and the booster up front, so I can really pull some
heat.  Still the fans don't really help until i've
been on the road at least 15 minutes for everything to
warm up, especially when its below 30 degrees out. 
But once its warm you notice the difference.

Installation was pretty simple, and if you have the
time it really helps to replace that old paper type
heater tube from the back with something insulated, i
used a pvc pipe wrapped in insulation.
