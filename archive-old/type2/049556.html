Hi Mike,

You asked for more nationalities who are on the Type 2 list. I know a few
guys in The Netherlands who are listees too.
Jan W Briër, Vincent Molenaar and me (Benny Kuiper) and some more people
from Holland (but I don't remember their names now) are known names for me.
But as far as I know there are at least 5 Dutch people on the list and it
may be even more than that.

Greetings from Holland

&gt; BTW - We are up to 335 names (!) and 51 URL's. I wonder how many countries
&gt; are represented... I know of Germany, UK, Australia, US, and Canada. Any
&gt; more?
