Subject: Buying a Pig in a Poke (was relation to Grendel?)

&gt;if you buy a cheap bus mail order w/o asking detailed questions &amp; 
&gt;getting pictures you can't expect a dreamboat.   I'd seen that bus 
&gt;around before, and thought it was a beater hippy bus,  but it had 
&gt;been driven from Colorado last summer.    Why shouldn't E think 
&gt;someone could put a motor in and drive it?

Clara,

I couldn't agree with you more.  I have bought and sold *many* buses 
over the last few years, many of which were &quot;sight unseen&quot;.  From my 
experience, most are not as good as they sound, but at the same time 
not as bad as they could be.

This year so far I bought a '65 Sundial (that for now is a keeper), 
bought &amp; sold a '68 Westy, bought &amp; sold a '69 Westy, sold a '66 
hardtop deluxe, and probably a few others I can't remember.

The '65 I bought from a list-member who acted as an agent between the 
PO &amp; myself.  The negotiated price was very good for the description 
given by the PO. The description, however, was inaccurate (which was 
not the fault of the agent).  The PO said it had a &quot;recently rebuilt 
dual-port&quot;, when in fact it had a single-port that someone had slapped 
a set of pistons &amp; cylinders in at some point (not &quot;recently&quot;).  

I knew before I left Kansas that motor would not get me home to 
Atlanta, but hopefully it would get me &quot;close&quot;.  I repaired the bare 
minimals to drive it &quot;safe&quot; (headlights, tail lights, one windshield 
wiper) and headed out.  If I would have repaired it to Hoover standards, 
I would still be in Kansas.  It broke down on me eight times, seven of 
which I was able to fix.  When the rod came through the case in 
Nashville, I attempted to find an engine to buy and keep going.

Being the day before Christmas Eve, there were no engines to be found.  
I rented a truck to tow it the rest of the way.  I got home Christmas 
Eve, right as dinner was being served.  Although there were a LOT of 
things wrong with this bus, and I have spent twice as much on it as I 
had planned, I still feel it was worth the time, money, and effort.

The '68 I bought for a trip to Colorado with my dad that fell through.  
I bought it from a guy who bought it out of a junkyard.  I replaced a 
lot of the electrical, adjusted the brakes, replaced the shifter 
coupling and shift rod bushings, put a new drag link in it, and put a 
dual-port engine with alternator in it.  I did almost nothing to it 
cosmetically and knew nothing about it other than the work I did on it.  
I sold it to a list member who has had a few minor problems with it 
since I sold it to him, although overall I think he is very happy with 
it.

The '66 I put an engine in, totally replaced the brakes, put new 
windshields and rubber in, almost totally re-wired, and did some 
cosmetic work and rust removal on.  I sold it to a local club member 
and when we took it for a test drive it popped out of fourth.  I had 
never driven other than around the block as I didn't have tags or 
insurance for it.  If I had known I would have to replace the tranny, 
I would have asked more for it.  But since the deal had been struck, 
I swapped trannys out of it the next day for no charge.  Two weeks 
later his girlfriend ran into a ditch and rolled it while driving 
drunk.  For two weeks he could have used a bungee cord!  ;)

The '69 I bought cheap and thought would be an easy profit (ha-ha!). 
I adjusted the brakes, bought a used GEX rebuilt single-port (less 
than 10 months old - my worst mistake), lots of minor work, and sold 
it to a young couple.  Within 3 weeks the motor blew, so I told them 
if they would tow it back to me I would give them their money back.  
Then I spent between $500-600 on parts &amp; machine work to build 
another motor for it (the GEX case was already 40 over and I do NOT 
do 60 over).  I also replaced the steering box.  I then sold it to the 
nephew of a list member (who traveled halfway cross-country to pick it 
up) for almost the same amount of money I had in it (not including my 
time).

When I buy, I try to buy as cheap as possible without feeling like 
I am taking advantage of the seller.  When I sell, I try to sell at 
a fair price and disclose any faults in the vehicle that I am aware 
of.  I try to be thorough in the mechanicals so the vehicle is safe 
to drive, and don't worry about cosmetics very much.  I think of each 
one of them as another that made it back to the road, as most of them 
would otherwise have been crushed or would have continued to rust 
away in someone's yard.

The lesson to be learned is go into any deal as informed as possible 
and ask the right questions before making a purchase.  Sometimes 
you will have to put more time &amp; money into a vehicle than you had 
planned, and most times you have to &quot;drive&quot; that money back out of it.
