Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia concept car

Now that is the bus that VW should have tried to make. That thing is awesome.
It would probably cost a fortune, but it has some really cool ideas. I like
the seat as steps to the bunk, that is cool. Nice to see someone come out with
a design that is at least close to the old bus design with a westy package.
