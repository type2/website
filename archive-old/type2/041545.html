Subject: Tranny Rebuild

Dear List:

After 10 years on relatively trouble free ownership of my bus ('79 westy)
I'm in the midst of the year from hell.  After just getting my engine back
in following an uexpected rebuild, I was performing routine maintenance
tonight such as changing the tranny fluid and repacking CVs in preparation
for a long camping trip starting Thursday.  When I drained the transmission
oil, the magnetic plug came out carrying chunks from what appears to be a
roller bearing.  Now this thing is working fine, but finding rollers in the
oil makes me think I'll be sleeping in a tent this weekend with the westy
sitting at home.

So what is the list wisdom regarding tranny rebuilders?  I'm in Indiana and
there is nobody that I know of locally that I would trust to do this.  I've
heard about the 5-speed tranny that the Gene Berg folks build.  Has anyone
done this? and with what kind of results?  Were modifications required?
etc. etc. etc.
