&gt; &gt; Actually, positive pressure would probably work better if he's somehow stuck

&gt; thought about that too.

&gt; But i'm not sure if my aircompressor can push a large enough volume of air
&gt; to move a mouse....not sure if a vac could either, really. ~sigh~

My father has a hand-held centrifugal   blower that could shoot that
mouse halfway down the block...

Unfortunately, it is a product of the '50s or '60s and the closest
commonly available is a leaf-blower.  some or those work in reverse, too.
