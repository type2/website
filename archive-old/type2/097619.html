Subject: Re: [T2] Rear shocks.

Several suggestions come to mind-
1) Get a lighter girlfriend:)
2) Get a bumper sticker that reads -
   &quot; If this Bus is Rockin'- Don'r Come Knockin&quot;!
3) OK, then-
The ride height is not controlled by the shocks.
Put the bus on a level spot. Make a measurement from a
common spot on both sides- bottom of the rocker or fender lip.
( Tires matched, air pressure equal ).
If the difference is an inch or more, consider a torsion bar adjustment.
Details are in the Bentley.
As for the bump noise, you do need new shocks.
But first see that the upper shock mount bolt is not loose.
And verify the rubber bump stop ( and the rubber shock bushings )
are still there.

Subject: [T2] Rear shocks.


&gt; Been getting a banging sound coming
&gt; from the right rear of the camper ever since I brought
&gt; Kermit home.  Only happens when hitting a good bump in
&gt; the road.  Thought it was something loose banging around
&gt; in back but on the way home from the airport last night,
&gt; I had my girlfriend drive while I sat in the back seat
&gt; and took a good listen.  Definately coming from the
&gt; right rear wheel well.  Upon getting home, there is a
&gt; slightly noticable list to the right.  Also, much more
&gt; play on the right than the left when rocking the camper
&gt; from side to side.
&gt;
&gt; My diagnosis....right rear shock.  Anything else it
&gt; could be that I'm not thinking about?
