I am still in NEED of a bus, more of a want, well anyway...
I live in Grand Rapids, MI, buses are fairly rare around here. Every day
on the way home from school(yes I am sill in high school) I drive past a
dealership, which has finner European cars. There is a bus that has been
there since last May, It is brown / tan, has curtains in the back windows
and looks really nice. I called when it showed up (last May) its a '79,
35,000 miles on the odo (mostlikely 135,000),  sunroof, AM/FM cassette,
its from Arizona and its rust free (I stopped to look at the underneith
and it looked really clean). The price at this time was $4495 which
seemed very steep even for a perfect bus. In November I called again and
the price had dropped to $3495, and the seats had been replaced, was
brown w/ one bench in the back, now black w/ two bench seats (probably
coun't find a complete set in brown). The spare tire on the front is
shot, the tred is peeling off, I stopped a few times at night and looked
at it from the end to see if the sides were wavy, they are actually very
straight. About a week ago I called to see if the price had gone down,
indeed it had now it is $2295 a lot closer to my price range, providing
the mechanicals are in good shape. When I asked if the engine had been
rebuilt the guy said that it may have been but they had no record of it
and that the PO had driven it from Pheonix to Seattle and back with out
problems. 

So the question is: is this a fair price if the mechanicals are in good
shape.

Also I called German Auto (local specialists) to see how much it would
cost to have them check out the mechanicals, it will be $60 to go through
it. Is that a fair price?
Are there any listees in the Grand Rapids area that might wnat to help
out a soon to be bus owner and look at this bus for less money, or for a
favor?
sorry for the huge post but I need get as much info as possible.

TIA,
Nic
