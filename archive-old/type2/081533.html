Subject: [T2] Downshifting and RPMs (was: Acceptable speeds)

There is only so much air you can blow through a straw.  Maybe at speeds
over 40 in third there is not enough air going through and things overheat.

If my '73 1700 at 3/4 throttle will not pull a hill at 45 in fourth, I
change to third and do 35.  If it wont pull the hill at 30 in third I change
to second and do 23.  If it wont pull the hill at 17 in second I change to
first and do 12.  If it wont pull the hill at 8 in first I change to reverse
and back down or turn around.  This way the engine never overheats.  230,000
miles on original engine and still going strong.

&gt; I agree with George (usually do :) but I want to share my experiences with
&gt; hills and downshifting to see if my experience is shared or anomolous.
&gt;
&gt; For some reason, downshifting in my '80 Vanagon does not net me the
&gt; benefits I would expect.  My &quot;driving style&quot; in mountains goes as follows.
&gt; As the grade increases and speed starts to fall, I floor it and let the
&gt; speed keep falling until it is below 50.  When it will not hold speed
&gt; above 50, I downshift to 3rd but also drop my speed below 40.  I have
&gt; found that both 3rd and 4th between 40 and 50 on a hill produce very high
&gt; oil temps.  In 4th, lugging and lack of air thru the fan explain what is
&gt; happening, no sweat.  However, I would think that I *should* be able to
&gt; hold 45-50 in 3rd w/o a problem, but I can't. It isn't a lack of HP, but
&gt; rather that if I try, the oil temps climb rather rapidly.  My thinking is
&gt; that the mechanical friction of spinning the engine overcomes the increase
&gt; in air thru the fan as trying to do 50 in 3rd even on the flat will raise
&gt; the oil temps significantly.  There may also be an air/fuel mix problem,
&gt; but the O2 sensor is not reporting one.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts on this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; but what
&gt; &gt; &gt; about city driving? Should I be _never_ using full throttle? It seems
like
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have serious trouble getting rolling if I don't goose it a little
bit in
&gt; &gt; &gt; first or second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No.  Full throttle is fine around town, just not when climbing long
hills.
&gt; &gt; You engine can absorb the heat of momentary full power, but long periods
&gt; &gt; of it tax the cooling system
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My second question is about the warmup procedure - the motor seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; veeerrry unhappy when cold - I definitely can't start it up and drive
away
&gt; &gt; &gt; like I used to in my '79 - what is the normal procedure for warming up
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine before driving away?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mine drives fine while cold.  Perhaps you need to check the carb
settings
&gt; &gt; and make sure the choke is operating properly.
