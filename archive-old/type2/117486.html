Subject: Re: [T2] Location of aux battery

&gt; I know this has been asked before on this list, but I cannot find any of the
&gt; old emails about it. What is the recommended location for the aux battery in
&gt; a bus with a BN4 gas heater. I currently have the battery in the left side
&gt; of the engine compartment, but the BN4 goes in this same location. I really
&gt; would like to install this heater for winter use. Does anyone have both a
&gt; heater and an aux battery installed in their bus and if so, where is it
&gt; located? I do remember the list had a lot of negative feedback about putting
&gt; the battery under the seat or anywhere in the engine compartment. 

I have my heater (BA-4) under the bus, 2nd battery in engine compartment
