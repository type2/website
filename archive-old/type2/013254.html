Well I'm getting into doing this, having bought too much stuff myself
recently for being the unemployed POS I am I figure I'll mention stuff
to others.

He claims they are German (they look like they could be) which would
be a $550 set.  They are at $85, and you can &quot;buy now&quot; for $200 which
is fairer than hell if they are German or Brazilian.  I wouldn't let the
little
bit of surface rust get to you.  He also has a 1.7 set for &quot;buy now&quot; for
even less.  These are deals folks.  I got no ties to the seller save for the
fact I'm buying my 96's off of him, and he has been real fair in regards to
my dealings there but I don't have em yet.  If you need to put together
an engine this summer, you will NOT beat these prices.  I'm sorely close
to buying the 1.7 set just to put together a spare engine for Bus retrieval.
