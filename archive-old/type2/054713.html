&gt; first it starts right up every time but then the idle fluctuates and 
&gt; it comes close to dying but doesn't.  When I take off there is a hesitation
&gt; in each gear until the rpm's get higher (I do not have a tach so I don't have
&gt; any idea what the actual rpms are)

Sounds like your auto choke either needs adjusting or replacing.
