Subject: bolt size

Sorry guys to bother you with such an easy one but i need the bolt size on 
the bottom bolt for the front shock absorbers. I cant find my hanyes manual 
or i would look it up. Ball joint if that makes a difference. Im not sure if 
it does. One of mine seems to have fallen off. Dont know how. thanks

Joey
