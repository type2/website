Subject: Re: help with hot engine??

&gt;OK, , ,
&gt;Now I've had the bus long enough to know what questions to ask , , , , , ,
&gt;
&gt;After driving in  town, just a short trip, When shut down, this puppy
&gt;is hottr'n a popcorn, , , well, you know.
&gt;Actually it's about as hot as if you had driven a water cooled engine
&gt;without water.
&gt;
&gt;Smokin' hot!!
&gt;
&gt;I suspect the carb is set too lean.
&gt;It's a '72 with single carb.
&gt;The tin has large gaps it it, also. Would that be a problem?


Here are some possible causes (some you have already mentioned).  All of
these need to be checked. If each are just a bit off, it will add up to one
hot engine:
1.  Timing too fast
2.  Carb too lean
3.  Missing or incorrect tin
4.  Engine seal damaged or missing
5.  Obstruction in the cooling tin
6.  Oil level
7.  Driving Habit
8.  Vaccum leak
9.  Valve problems
10. Oil cooler restriction
