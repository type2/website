Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Curtain over sliding door 

The sliders that GoWesty sells are the right ones. They work good in my
camper with my new curtains. I actually sewed the sliders to my curtain.
Just kind of space them out so it works good.

I have to say though if you go camping a lot I would consider retrofitting a
curtain rod directly on the sliding door. It isn't as easy to pull those
little sliders. There are some pics of my sliding door curtain at the bottom
of this page:

Good luck!

&gt; Matt, and Listees,
&gt;     A little less than a year ago I made new curtains for our '71, so I
can
&gt; tell you how I addressed these issues.
&gt; 1.  &quot;How on earth do I use the pre-existing track over the sliding
&gt; door?&quot;.....
&gt;        That track should have small plastic sliders in it.  I don't know
if
&gt; it is the ones sold by GoWesty or not.  I put small grommets in the top of
&gt; the curtain, one grommet for each slider.  I put a grommet at each end and
&gt; then equally spaced out the rest.  You can get theses small grommets and
the
&gt; pliers to set them at fabric shops.  Then I used a piece of string to tie
&gt; the curtain through the grommet to the slider.
&gt; 2    &quot;Does the Cab curtain need elastic on the top of the curtain to keep
&gt;        it from sagging? And are there only 4 snaps (A &amp; B pillars) or
should
&gt; there
&gt;        be one under the rearview mirror?&quot;.......
&gt; The stock set up is 4 snaps like you mentioned and the curtain had a draw
&gt; string in the top of it to take up any slack.   When I made our new
curtains
&gt; I used 2 additional snaps, one behind each end of the rearview mirror,
&gt; instead of the draw string.  That works good to hold up the middle of that
&gt; front curtain and maintain privacy.
&gt;     For me the hardest part of the curtain project was deciding on what
&gt; material to use.  The possibilites are endless, ranging from wild to mild.
