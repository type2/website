I read about a Dwell meter substitute while perusing an UltraVan (Corvair powered aluminum RV, 22' long weighs 4000lbs) reference document.

Put your Voltmeter on a 12 volts D.C. voltage scale, with the minus lead grounded and the plus lead on the distributor post. With the engine running the flickering voltage from the distributer shows up as the average of 0 to 12 volts. This average can be calibrated as dwell. To calibrate your voltmeter you need to have the points set CORRECTLY, THEN connect the volt meter as above and mark on the face of the meter where the needle sits. This represents the correct point gap. This mark will only work for 4 cylinder engines that should have the same point gap .16 to .17.

What do you think? I haven't tried it yet.
