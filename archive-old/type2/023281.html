Subject: Re: [type2] Jalousie Window Install Question

Corners hitting?

I had to use a friend to pull down on the outside of the frame while I got 
some screws in the bottom row - don't tighten...

Then pushed in at top to start top row...

Then tightened them all in a criss-cross pattern.

Make sure that you are putting them in right so the knobs at the front or 
the rear - where ever you prefer.

If they aren't right - swap the left for the right side and go again.

I used silicone spray and a plastic knife.

I also replaced the OEM screws with tiny (same size) stainless steel screws 
purchased at LOWE's hardware.

Looks nice and no corroded screw heads.

If it makes you feel any better, I scratched the hell out of my sliding 
door too.

The second window was easy!

Good luck.

&gt;&lt;Sigh&gt; Good Morning Folks,
&gt;      Well, things were going too well with my paint job on the '77. Painted
&gt;it Friday, started putting things back together yesterday. I ordered all new
&gt;seals for the glass, but will need help putting most of it back in. It's
&gt;been my experience though that one person can install the jalousie windows,
&gt;did it on my old '76. Well last night I put one of the seals on the window
&gt;frame-seal seems to fit OK-then proceeded to scratch the %$#&amp; out of the
&gt;sliding door around the recess where the window goes in. I've never had this
&gt;much trouble installing one of these windows. As I said, I remember doing
&gt;this before on the '76, installing these with new seals with no problem. Any
&gt;ideas? I tried coating the seal with silicone, the window still would not
&gt;fit back into place. Very frustrating! TIA, Jeff
