Subject: Re: [T2] Accident

&gt;contact your agent if you have one, give him the
witness name and number.  might talk to a lawyer
if your neck is bothering you or even if it
isn't...

Unfortunately, I'm not optimistic.  The agent,
actually the adjuster, isn't going to have any
incentive to help you.  As you have liability
only, that is all they will be concerned about. 
In others words, they will use the info to deny
liability, but they won't help you collect a
penny from the other guy.  An attorney won't be
of much help either if you don't have some
personal injury.  The amount is just too small. 
If you are hurt at all, see a doctor and then
call the attorney.

Happy bussin'
