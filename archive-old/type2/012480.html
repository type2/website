Hi Melissa,

The aluminum York R209R was a popular compressor used
on a lot of American cars and trucks.  However, on my
80 the pulley (4.5 inch) and clutch are unique to this
DPD VW aftermarket system.  You need to find one from
an early (70s to early 80s) VW bus or Westy to get the
clutch and pulley.  Then if the compressor is no good,
you can get the compressor from a variety of other
places.  The clutch and pulley come off the York
compressor fairly easily, without special tools.  If
you find an extra pulley/clutch get me one too.

Rob
