I thought he was suggesting getting a complete top from any bus and
cutting out to match the current hightop and welding it in as a
replacement for the rusted out parts...

which is probably what I would do.

second choice would be the entire Westy top.

third choice would be a decent body and swapping all your stuff onto it
