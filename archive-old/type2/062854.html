Subject: Binary Attachments [Was: Camping stuff I built for my Vanagon]

&gt;... attaching photos.  If that isn't
&gt;forbidden by the list charter, it should be.

It is. And the server will bounce out anything big enough to be a binary.

I have an anonymous ftp server for the list. There's nothing in it yet, but
if somebody needs space for photos I can put them there.
