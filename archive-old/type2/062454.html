&gt;&gt;I wish it the final version of carb tipe in the makes(year).

I dunno, though. Those are getting really hard to find.

(?) (??)

One of the colleges I went to acted as the Southeastern hub for foreign
exchange students from Japan, and in the summertime they would roll in in
waves. I had more than a few for roommates, and they were all damned fine
people (all guitarists, all very poor guitarists, you ain't missed nothing
until you've missed a Japanese college student singing &quot;Purple Haze&quot; while
accompanying himself). But sometimes it took me days to figure out what
they were talking about.
