In any PepBoys they sell 300 watt inverters that plug in (about $59 or
500 watt that must be wired in for about $89-99.  A 300 watt works for
TV, a fan, or laptop fine.   I have used both, the 300watt is handier. 
I wouldn't load it beyond 70% of its rated capacity.  Used ours mostly
for a TV and a Dreamcast (Sega) in the Westy-also to recharge camera
batts and run a shaver.  The 13&quot; color TV-VCR (Panasonic) is only 65
watts; you can get a smaller 9 one also.  the 300 watt one will do all
this.  I bought from a Best Buy accessories section a laptop car 12v
plug; it pulls apart to plug into airline outlets.  For fans, check BOAT
supply stores, the Caframo fans push good air without needing a cage and
have minimal interferance with a TV.  Our laptop plays DVD's; we use an
external PC speaker setup with this.  I think the 9&quot; tv in our Westy can
be seen at http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin, views of our Westy
with a lot of mods.

&gt; I'm going to to wire a DC-&gt;AC inverter to my second battery and looking for
&gt; suggestions on wattage.  Most likely used for fan, laptop, battery
&gt; recharger, maybe a small boombox, etc. What size inverters have people used......
