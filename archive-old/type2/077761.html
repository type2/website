Subject: 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine

Hi Volks:

Ugh, my '78 Westy has apparently dropped a valve seat. Time for yet
another top end rebuild. This makes about 6 in 10 years. Only about 20K
miles since the last one (that was a burned ring). I even found
myself thinking the unthinkable, albeit briefly: sell the bus?

But I can view this as an opportunity. My 2.0L engine came to me with 1800
heads and I've rebuilt it with 1800 heads several times. They used to be a
lot more available and affordable than 2.0L heads and they can be swapped
without modification to anything else. But now I find that The Bus Depot
has a source of heads that makes them all cost the same, so now maybe it's
time for me to get back to 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine as God and the VW
engineers intended. My bus has not seen that since it's youth before me.

If power is directly proportional to displacement, then I might expect to
see a 10% increase in performance. Will I really? That would be cool.

Anyone out there made the switch and care to comment on the power/
performance difference, 1800-2000?

Anyone out there care to comment on the quality of The Bus Depot's heads
and their claim that the remanufature process they use is &quot;better than
original&quot; and somehow reduces dropped valve problems? I know generally
that dropped valve seats are the Achilles Heel of aircooled VW engines and
that this is a notoriously difficult engineering and design problem due to
the high heat of aircooled exhaust valves. I would welcome more technical
comment on this subject.

happy trails,
