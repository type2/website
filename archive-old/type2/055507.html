I have ran across an interesting item and was wondering what 
interests there may be for application development.

There is a company that is manufaturing a gasoline water heater.  
pretty much works on the principles of the gas heaters many of us are 
used to but heats water instead.  It also has a water pump to move the 
hot water to whatever application you may use it for.  Its primary 
purpose was to keep an engine block hot without running and secondary 
for interior heating.

My thoughts are to pump hot water to a heater core that is mounted so 
that it recirculates air from the interior to the current ducting and 
bypasses the OEM heater box setup.  Has anyone looked at an 
application like this before?  and what type of interests might there 
be?
