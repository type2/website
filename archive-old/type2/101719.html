Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Charcoal Canister exploded

Hi Jaybird,

	For this purpose, in general activated carbon is activated carbon.  There
are different size pellets and some claim higher pourosity, but for the most
part anything that is good enough to work in a fish tank should be okay for
your bus.  Stay away from the really small pellets and fine crushed carbon,
as they will tend to compact more and turn to dust than good extruded
pellets will.  I would also stay away from coconut shell based carbon, as it
is usually pretty brittle and dusty.  	In my saltwater reef tanks and discus
breeding tanks, I used to use Kent Marine pelletized carbon with very good
results.  It is less dusty and seems to absorb more organics than other
brands I have tried.  It is a bit spendy, but it is what I will be using
when I finally get everything back to stock (relatively speaking, I have a
'73 code CD engine in my '72) on Gretta.  Since you will only be replacing
it every 30,000 miles or so, the 15 bucks for the good carbon probably won't
kill you (isn't your engine and your planet worth the extra $0.0005 per
mile?)
	Which brings me to the next obvious question - does anyone have a decent
charcoal cannister that will fit in my '72 that they are willing to part
with?  I am happy to pay a fair price or maybe trade out for something I
have in my parts stash.  Let me know.

&quot;I'm going to refill it and use some black silicone to seal it back up.&quot;

     What do you think the chances are of the Activated Carbon material they
sell at pet supply stores for fish tank filters working well as a
replacement for the carbon in these canisters?  I know you can get it in
different sized pellets and such, and activated carbon is all the same,
right?  What do you use to refil these?

Thanks,
Jaybird
