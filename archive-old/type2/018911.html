Dear List Members,

For those who are interested, I spoke with a fellow also named Chris :-)
at Handicapped Driver Services, Inc in Kennesaw, GA. He was very nice,
and they definitely have the driver's ed program, but their hand
controls are limited to vehicles which have power steering,  power
brakes (?) and automatic transmissions. He was concerned about the
safety of driving with a hand clutch (no hands for the steering wheel)
and was not very responsive to experimenting with triggers, levers etc.
on the shifter. I guess they have all they can handle with the program
they are already running. (Somehow I got the impression he would not
enjoy my string and eyebolt idea). They sound like a wonderful bunch of
folks but I'm still back to square one so I'll keep looking.

Pensively yours,

Chris

Restoration for a little tweeking and preening
