Gentlepersons-
                       My 2L is sans the electric booster fan and 
hardware...It's gonna get cold
soon. Anybody have a quick fix to seal off the oval holes in the tops of the 
heat ex-
changers? E.G. Shoprite sardine cans are the exact size and can be quickly 
inserted to
fill that void...
TIA
