&gt;I think that you need to check your solution.  I get
&gt;
&gt;t=4.17s or t=3.48s

FWIW I get the same solutions.  &amp; the same 3.8s from the velocity equation...

I'm wondering where the -23fs^-2 (rate of acceleration) came from &amp; 
why it's a constant.  With the van pitching forward &amp; the brakes 
heating up, &amp; the fact that an object's kinetic energy increases as a 
square WRT velocity, it should *not* be constant, correct?

Did the ppl doing this have a tape measure &amp; accelerometer, but left 
the stopwatch at home??

We could get an average acceleration if we knew the time it took to 
travel these now heavily-travelled 167ft.  :)
