Subject: 15 in. wheels


&gt; Anybody have any experience with converting to 15 inch wheels on a
breadloaf?
&gt; An on-
&gt; line wheel source indicated Mercedes Benz wheel code et37 6.5 x 15 h2 ,
but
&gt; didn't
&gt; reveal what model(s) or years.

The only Mercedes [in the US] that uses 6.5Jx15 H2 ET37 wheel is the C
class, C220 + C280. The C class came out in 1994. This is a 8-hole alloy
wheel. It also has 12mm wheel bolt holes. Only the S class [140 and 220] and
the M class [ML320/430] use 14mm bolts. You could drill the holes to 14mm,
but I didn't try a 19mm socket in the hole. MB uses 17mm head on both 12mm +
14mm wheel bolts. I measured a few different MB alloys today [but not the
6.5 ET37] and they were either 10mm or 22mm thick at the bolt holes. This
means you would need studs at least this much longer.
