Subject: Re: [T2] wiring help needed

 
--Dave,

#1

the big nut is terminal 30. the other male tabs on the solenoid are both teminal 50 (no difference electrically)

you should have a red/white and a red/black correct?

#2

The only red/blue I know is fuel pump power from the double relay, but it would be much longer.

Billy

&gt;There are two wires with push on connectors near the starter and two male &gt;push on terminals on the solenoid, but how do I identify which wire goes to &gt;which terminal?  The five wires with round connectors obviously go to the &gt;screw post so I think no problem there.

&gt;Second Question:  I have a 4-6 inch piece of blue/black striped wire with a female connector at each end, but no idea of where it goes.
