Subject: Accelerator cable sleeve

Greeetings,

Sorry to repost but I can't find this anywhere and hope to place an order 
today.

'79 2.0 liter FI going into a '78 body

I need the part number for the accelerator pedal cable tube/housing/sleeve. 
This is the black plastic covered sprial wire deal that goes from the rear 
conduit and through the upright cooling tin. Even though I have 2 both are 
bent/tweeked enough so that the end of the cable will not fit through the 
constriction(s). All I can find is cables and no housng. Or any ideas for a 
fix? My attempts at straightening have proved futile.

Thanks,
Brandt
