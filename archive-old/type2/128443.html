Subject: Parts in Ontario

What part of Ontario? Ontario is a REALLY big province.

There is a guy near Haley Station, Ont. It's on Hwy. 17 between Renfrew and Cobden, Ont, near the Ontario/Quebec border.

My twin brother lives near him and has long admired the fleet of early 70s orange busses at this place. I'll try to get the business name if you are interested. Please pmail me.
