Subject: Bus Not Starting (sort of...)
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1999 07:21:50 -0800

Greetings,
 
    My '79 is having problems and I am writing the list to see if anyone
can..  HELP!!!!
 
The Symptoms:
   Bus turns over and starts, then has a high idle for 1 second and abruptly
stops.
   I can keep it going by giving it a little gas, but this causes the engine
to race at high RPMs.
   SO, needless to say it cannot be driven.
 
The bus's engine is a stock (as far as I can tell) 79, 2.0 Liter, fuel
injection, with a Pertronix
Ignitor that I installed around 9 months ago.
 
I have not been able to check the problem yet, so I anyone has seen this
before, please let me
know where to look so that the green bus can be on the road again.
 
Thanks,
 
    Peter Small
 
79 Bus
