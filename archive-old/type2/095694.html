Subject: RE: [T2]  Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...


Just wanted to thank everyone for there feedback. After checking the
Bentley, the archive and the weather I decided to go with Castrol HD40.

I'll be In Tucson for another day or so, then I'll be heading east bound
with a copy of the AIRS list just in case. I'm hopeful that the engine keeps
running as good as it has been for the last year and ten thousand miles.
This is my first bus and has served me very well on numerous trips up and
down the west coast. Thanks to Tommy and Trent at the No Name Garage in
Eugene.

Cheers
	-Dave
