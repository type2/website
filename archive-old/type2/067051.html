Subject: Replacement sliding door handle

My plastic sliding door handle broke at the CCC gathering
last month at Mammoth Lakes, CA.  That's the 3rd or 4th
handle I've been through.

After threatening to make one out of oak for a year or so
I finally did just that.  So far it's working nicely.

1. Remove the hub of the old handle from the lock.
2. Chip away the plastic from the metal &quot;nut&quot; insert.
3. Measure and cut a piece of oak to clear the Westy sink unit.
4. Measure the location of the metal &quot;nut&quot; on the oak handle.
5. Drill out the oak handle using an electric drill.
6. Mill out special &quot;nut&quot; contours in oak using a Dremel moto-tool.
7. Add 5-min epoxy to the hole.
8. Tap the metal &quot;nut&quot; insert into the hole in the oak handle.
9. Install on sliding door using original philips bolt and lockwasher.

Note:
Use care handling the outer sliding door handle while the old
handle is off.  The metal &quot;nut&quot; insert is used to hold the lock
assembly in the door.  You could easily pull the outer handle
out of the door while the &quot;nut&quot; is not in place.

This was performed on a '73 Westfalia model.  Those darned inside
sliding door handles are notorious for failing on other Type2 models.
YMMV.
