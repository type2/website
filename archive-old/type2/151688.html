Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Lordy, lordy guys,

Thanks!  The kit like Sherwin got was about $400...I picked it up around 
Oklahoma city and so saved the shipping charge....that was the bus maiden 
voyage....4 hours at 75mph one way and then back.

The inside unit was not bad to install.  The underneath part is easy if 
you lay it on a piece of plywood and the just jack it up in the right 
place.

Routing hoses and electrical was a snap....remember, these were built for 
a guy at the port to be able to install it in 4 hours!...and they could!

Of course he didn't install the *first* one in 4 hours...and neither will 
you(or I).

The hard part was my modified mount and compressor...and the week of 
waiting on the *correct*(thanks NAPA!) compressor fittings.

The part I like is *rotary* *and* all under the original tin!

Otherwise, just slow carefull work....ok, the drain hole should go 
here...oh, wait, that would be straight thru the frame...hmmmmmm...damn, 
that means it needs to go over here instead of straight down the 
pillar...sigh, ok, it has to go there.  Spent 30 minutes looking poking 
and measuring before I punched that hole thru the body!.

Cheers, dave
