last weekend i was needing to go to st. loius to pick up about 3000 lbs of 
freight ( for my business)....and was going thru the bus ( a 73 ) with a fine 
tooth comb. tuned up, front end greased, brakes adjusted, fan belt good, set 
valves...etc.  you know the drill.  anyways i had noticed my tires were 
beginning to show small weathering cracks around the bead area.  i panicked 
and started calling tire shops and seaching the archives for info.  there 
seemed to be a lot of comments about tires but not the specific info i needed 
( i will post my specific q's later ) anyways didnt buy the new tires, i had 
to get on the road.

left sat. morning, 7 hrs straight driving  with one stop for gas, we arrive 
in st. louis sat evening.  spent sun hanging around town , vege'n out.  
checked over the motor monday morning all looks ok.....loaded up 56...50 lb 
bags (2800 total lbs), pumped the tires to 40 psi. and we were off.

got home late monday nite...without a hitch.  19.1 mpg coming back.....18.9 
mpg going there.  used 1/2 qt. oil in a little over 1000 miles round trip.  
held 65 mph minimum.  i guess it goes to show with routine maintenance these 
buses have a lot of life in them....( and i was thinking of getting a 
business truck this year........hmmmm.......when this bus has been paid for 
for years...not on my life.)
