&gt;Hey Volks,
&gt;     I just got my new (to me anyway) air compressor going.  I 
&gt; finally have something with decent pressure and CFM.  It's a big 
&gt; SpeedAire from like the 50's or so, dual stage, 80 gallon tank.
&gt;
&gt;     Most of the tools I have say to oil daily.  What do I oil them with?
&gt;Is there some special air too oil?  How much do I drop in?

At the shop I worked at the compressor was set to 100 (as I recall). 
We put a couple drops of Marvel Mystery oil in before we used the 
tool first time in the day.
Buster's air tools never died.

I use a drop or two of air tool oil before I use my tools. I figure 
if it worked for Buster for over 30 years it would work for me.

These were not painting tools.
