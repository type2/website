Subject: Re: [T2] Top speed

&gt; A lot of folks have said that they feel intimidated by traffic passing
&gt; them.  I've never had any problem with it.  There are quite a few vehicles
&gt; going 55-60 even on roads posted higher.

I don't mind the 58 MPH on the flat, but I live at 7500 feet, in the
mountains, and sometimes find myself in second gear up some of the hills...
I pull it onto the shoulder if anyone comes up behind me, as 25 in a 55 is a
little ridiculous for 2003.  Does anyone know where I can get one of those
&quot;Never, ever, get behind a VW&quot; bumper stickers?  : )
