I'll take a chance and answer this on the &quot;list&quot; because I believe it has 
Type II content.
A few weeks ago I posted on this list that there was a nice rust free low 
mileage &quot;78 Dormobile in Santa Clara CA that someone could get for $1000.00 
or less, and I'd help in any way I could with the purchase.  I got a couple 
of bites, but no takers.  There are lots of &quot;bargains&quot; on the net if you look 
and act.
