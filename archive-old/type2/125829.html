Subject: Stupid Elec. Question

Hey Zach,
           Considering you've got a 1970, my first suggestion would be that you 
look at the ground connections.  Prob'ly the turn signal housing is not well 
grounded to the body.  The screws get rusty, etc.  Next, the headlamp unit has 
a 3-pin (3 wire) connector, on which the brown wire (if I remember correctly) 
goes to ground -- so check that your headlamp is getting a good, solid ground.  
The terminal may be rusty and/or corroded.  Think of it this way: when the 
headlamp is ON, it is making &quot;exclusive&quot; use of the available ground 
connection.  That's the best way I can express it in non-techie terms.  As a 
matter of preventive maint. you might do the other side while you're at it.

Good luck....Glenn

   .... right turn signal... works fine with headlight off. Won't work
      with headlight or driving lights on. Thanks Zach
