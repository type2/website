Subject: 67 Front inside brake lines

Hi all. I am at a choke point, for me not Lucinda. She is a 67 Deluxe
Microbus. The front inside brake lines need to be replaced(what a BIG
surprise). I got one of lines that were bent to approximate shape, but they
are not fitting correctly. I think I need more line to bend and sit flat on
the backing plate. Does anyone make pre - bent front inside lines? Also,
the Big Bus Manual shows two springs of the same type on the top and
bottom. The kit I got has only one of the correct shape. Suggestions?
        Thanks, Lucinda and I thank you from the bottom of our transaxle.
        Mike
