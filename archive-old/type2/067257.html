Subject: busses in movies

I saw a show last weekend, on the making of the new movie,  &quot;High School
High&quot;.  In one of the shots, in the background was a bus, but I really
wasn't paying that much attention to get details, I think it was white
though.  Anyways, if anyone goes to see the movie, keep your eyes open, I
think the principal was in the foreground, and the school, or a brick
wall was in the background with the bus.                Dallas
