Hi All

Is there some way of retrieving archived list messages in plain text
form off the net??

Or can you access the archives without having to use the search
facility ie just read the threads as they occurr but online

I foolishly deleted a heap of messages that I now realise I would like
to keep!!

TIA for your help

Darryn
