&gt; happily sell you &quot;something close&quot; which is *wrong*!  I think=20
&gt; you would be
&gt; happier buying the right diameter line from a VWFLAPS or from=20
&gt; one of the
&gt; list vendors.  While you are at it, buy (and insist on) FI clamps all
&gt; around as well.

I'll take that advice.  Now my question is how much line to buy, and
how many clamps do I need?  (I could wait until I get home and
count but I'll probably order them online today with the line assuming
the Bus Depot has them.)  The Bus Depot has 7mm line,  is it good line?
