Subject: RE: Need Heat Exchangers Westy 72
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; I need heat exchangers for a Westy 72
&gt; This suckers are very hard to come by:
&gt;
&gt; Please any help will be apreciated:


I have ten left-hand-side original German ones coming from Europe in about
10 days, for $139.95. They are much heavier duty than the Danish ones made
today, and will deliver more heat and last longer.  A right side heat
exchanger, in Danish, will run you $179.95.  Even a combination of one of
each will work far better than a pair of Danish ones, and for less money.
Anyone with a '72-74 bus would be well advised to snatch up one of the
German ones while you can, even if just to put on a shelf until you need it;
once they are gone there will be no more.
