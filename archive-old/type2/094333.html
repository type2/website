Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint went

Better not drive on it unless you have a cell phone and the number of a tow
truck!!  If it is the CV, they like to lock up.  If it is the swing arm
bearing, the wheel could start to wobble and mess more things up.

This is why it is sooooo important to have CV's and rear wheel bearings
greased the first thing when you buy a bus and then NO MORE than 25,000 on
the CV's and 40,000 on the rear wheel bearings before greasing again.  Any
kind of tears in the boots will shorten the life of the CV's.

I hope this didn't sound like a chewing out, just trying to make the point
that so many people overlook, or just plain don't do.

Like the old mechanic said, &quot;either you can pay me a little now for some
grease, or a LOT later to replace!!!&quot;

&gt; I was driving along yesterday to a click-click sound.  It wasn't
&gt; intermittent so I dismissed it as a rock in the tire because it was hard to
&gt; hear.  Today there is a grinding noise. I can feel it through the acc. Pedal
&gt; and the ride is rough.
&gt; 
&gt; One look at the cv boots and one has a 3 inch crack in the outer boot; that
&gt; was something I noticed a month back and had scheduled time to replace but
&gt; the boot wouldn't wait any longer.  The grease inside it looks pretty dried
&gt; up.  These are original joints and boots and have never been attended to.
&gt; 
&gt; The other side looks ok but I'm new to this part of the bus.  How much play
&gt; in the axle in normal, in every possible direction?  I'd like to compare one
&gt; axle to the other before I tear everything down and start replacing.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to replace the parts asap but can I drive on this?  Will the one
&gt; joint tearing itself up affect the inner joint with it's boot still in tact?
