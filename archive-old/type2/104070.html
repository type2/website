Subject: Re: FI mixture ratio

OK folks, thank all of you for your facts and
opinions.  This is (to me) quite interesting stuff. 
So I brought my bus down to the guy who did the smog
test.

Rather than put it on the dyno, he simply made two
'tiny' adjustments while I watched, one to the AFM,
one to the idle mixture screw..  basically he said he
made it a wee bit richer and asked me to drive it and
report back to him.  Essentially he told me he was
undoing the slight leaning adjustment he made in order
to pass smog.

Since he seemed reluctant to put it on the dyno, I
didn't push the matter.  He may not be the most
knowledgeable person about this, but said he's
readjusted many VW's closer to their previous settings
(pre smog test) when the owners came back asking for
*more power*.

Could be my imagination again, but I did think I felt
just a tad more pull through the mid range of the
power band.

At this point I think I'll leave well enough alone 
until I find someone in LA experienced in making these
adjustments on a dyno.

Cheers,

- Randy
