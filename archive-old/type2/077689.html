Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

Bob, list:
Didn't early splitties use a cable operated off-on-reserve valve like the bugs? It
wouldn't just bolt on, but it sure would be sweet. Probably have to braze the pickup
into the tank. Give a little more theft protection, too, for those concerned about
that.
Otherwise, there has to be some electrical type used on boats.

&gt; I like the idea of the spring loaded, solenoid tripped valve, it could
&gt; have a cable pull override if the solenoid failed,   they work on
&gt; diesel should work on gasoline.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How about a vacuum solenoid so there was no electricity involved? Vacuum
&gt; &gt; holds it open, no vacuum, no open. Would require an electric something to
&gt; &gt; open it at engine start for the fuel injected engines.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The other way would be to use the vacuum to close the valve in case of
&gt; &gt; emergency. Hmmm. Bet this version would fail when it was needed the most.
