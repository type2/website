Subject: thanks

I would just like to say thanks to all the people who helped with the
cylinder numbers.  Also i apologise in calling the bus a car.  I was in a
hurry and made an error.  I just finished doing the pushrod seals and i
just finished adjusting the valves.  The good thing is i think it runs a
little better.  But their is a bad thing that is it still leaks oil. :(  I
do think that that the seals are holding i put silicon on them.  I think it
is the valve covers that are leaking but i don't know why.  I heard that
your not supposed to use silicone so i didn't use anything.  Should i of? 
If i shouldn't use silicone what should i use.  Also a last question is
that does anyone know where i can get some heater boxes for cheap?  Thanks
everyone.
