Dear List Members,

Okay, you guys with the stats...I can't believe that a bunch of guys who
drive cars which run on pure mojo (albeit with a significant number of
grated and smashed sacrificial knuckles and certain ceremonial words our
moms would kill us for saying thrown in) would forget the &quot;magic quotient&quot;.
Sheesh! That's how Santa does it with magic! See, the simple explanation is
usually the best! Cherchez le mystery!

Love to you all :-)

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
