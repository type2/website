Subject: Re: [T2] Tank breather elbow

fuel line - or is that pipe bigger than fuel lines? 
 That's what I changed all of my breather hose joints with 
and cinched 'em up with clamps - haven't smelled any fumes 
since.  In your case, I'd make sure that you have enough 
hose to allow it to curve nicely instead of kinking.
