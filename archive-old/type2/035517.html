Subject: Free color wiring diagram for '79 bus.
Content-Disposition: inline

I downloaded this somewhere a while ago and finally printed it out on a wide color
printer. After taping each of the pages together, I noticed that it is for a 79 and
my bus is a '78.

If you have a '79, I'm happy to mail the diagram to you.
