&gt; Hi.  I'm new to this list and I'd like to thank all of you for the wealth of 
&gt; knowledge I've found here.  I've spent several days researching the archives 
&gt; and I'm about to purchase my first type2.  It will need to ferry my kids (3, 
&gt; 2, and in utero) to and from school and other activities.  So naturally I 
&gt; want to make sure they'll be safe.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a found a beautiful '71 bus in my area (Toronto) that's in great 
&gt; shape all over.  Before I buy it, I was hoping a list member might be able 
&gt; to advise me on the complexities of adding bench seats with headrests and 
&gt; 3-point retractable seatbelts all around.

My '71 has hard points for 3-point belts in all seats.  Common Audi/VW
inertia reel belts are easily adapted to the front seats.  I have sirocco
self-adjusting lap belts in the rear seat, but no shoulder harnesses yet.
That area would take a bit more work then the fronts to install inertia
reel belts.
