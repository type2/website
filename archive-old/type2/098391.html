Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage poll

When I bought my bus I was surprised that we even made
it home before the spark plugs fouled out. The PO said
that it got around 14mpg in the city and 16mpg on the
highway. He said that was typical and I believed him.
Oh in case you were wondering it had a 1700 automatic
with progressive Weber ( with no air filter and messed
up choke) and a 009 dizzy. Once we got it home, I
couldn't let it idle for more than 20 minutes before
the plugs fouled out. Any way, I hope my gas mileage
improves with my new fi engine. ;)
