Um. Todd.  That's &quot;gauge.&quot;  Which engine do you normally operate, type1 or 4?
How do you normally drive?  What is the normal outside temperature?

&gt;2) If I have a cyl head temperature guage, should I still have an oil
&gt;temperature guage?

I would.

&gt;3) What is the easiest way to make SURE that my &quot;Generator&quot; light is really
&gt;working?

Turn the ignition key to the &quot;on&quot; position.

&gt;4) What should the spark plug gap be set to?

Bentley spec.

&gt;6) How can I convince my fiancee that 401K retirement accounts are
&gt;important, and that we should be saving and not buying tons and tons of new
&gt;furniture.

You'd be better off convincing your financee' that ACVW parts prices outperform
mutual funds.  Mine did this year.
