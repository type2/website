Ah, downshifting, near and dear to my heart.  Trouble is, I love manual
transmissions, so I am completely biased.

If you know how to do it right, it produces almost no wear and tear on the
clutch face and the engine doesn't mind either.  In the meantime, your
brakes will thank you, cause you're not wearing them out.  The vehicle is in
far better shape to do something useful in a jam if it's in gear.  You can
coast to a stop in neutral, but it wears out the brakes in a jiffy and
there's no point in it.  Try to enjoy the process, but if it's that much of
a huff, either make your peace with the brake work or get an automatic
(can't believe I said that).  Using the compression of the motor to resist
the momentum of the bus uses no extra fuel at all.

A cup holder makes it a little less interesting, if that helps.  Good luck.
