Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN: Re: mystery e-mails from the list?

Volks,

Just so you know, next time you think that the &quot;no attachments, no html,
ASCII plain text only&quot; rules are annoying....  This is why they exist!  If
you get a worm/virus and it e-mails itself to the list, the list will kick
it back automatically.

David Raistrick started the ASCI Ribbon thing and I suppoort it intensely,
but it has been list policy since the days when Ken ran the list.  Nothing
but ASCII text belongs in e-mail.  Free web sites are just too easy for
transferring html and binary (.gif, .jpg, .mp3, .wav, etc. etc.) files
with way more controls (hint: automatically execute NOTHING!!!)

                           Steve Dolan

 X  - NO Word docs in e-mail
/ \ - NO V-Cards in e-mail

&gt; Do note that this did not come VIA the list, instead it was sent directly
&gt; to you, because the persion infected with the virus recieved an email from
&gt; you (which happened to come from our list. should you send one directly,
&gt; you'd get the same result.)
&gt;
&gt; Alas, nothing I can do to stop that.
