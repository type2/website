Wow, the idea of flashing your high-beams to tell them it's not safe to pass
is pretty scary, since for as long as I've driven, I've always understood
that this is a signal to say it is safe.  I only do this to big trucks
(and they often give nice signals back) and I presumed I was correct.  The
trucks need the flash because it is real hard to estimate the position of the
end of one of those triple-trailer beasts they drive out west here.  I'd sure
hate to signal them it was safe when it wasn't!

Maybe I've been wrong for twenty years.

Go figger.
