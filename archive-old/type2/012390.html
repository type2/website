Subject: Thanks everybody for the rebuild info
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,

First, I would like to thank everyone for their
helpful comments and suggestions about rebuild kits
and rebuilt heads. I am pretty sure I am going to go
with the AVP p/c's and rpobably the heads as well.

Many local VW mechanics have strongly discouraged me
from rebuilding my 73 transporter's pancake engine.
Most want me to put a bug engine in it because of
availablity and price of parts. I personally would
rather rebuild the pancake that is in it.

My transporter, by most standards, is a discouraging
eye sore. I am a senior in high school and have been
working on the body for the last two years. My body
work techniques have improved a bit from trail and
error and working at my grandfather's body shop. My
grandfather has retired but I still have access to the
body shop. 

It sits there, completely covered in old primer, its
windows out and has areas of incomplete work all over
it. This year is when most of the constructive work
has been done to it. I got down to business, stripping
the entire top, from the body line under the windows,
fixing all dents and priming the top. I am in the
process of fixing panel by panel. I am currently
working on the sliding door. I have replaced the front
and back skins on the bottom six inches of the door.
Soon, the mud work will be done on that and I can move
to the next panel.

I want to thank The Bus Depot for their great service.
I have bought a few things from them. They are the
first place I look when I need a part for my bus.

I know that I am rambling, and I know that most of you
could care less but like most of you, there is
somthing about my bus that keeps me working on it. One
day, It will be a daily driver. Thanks again for all
the help!

David Kelly

one fixed door. I see progress.&quot;
