While you are replacing things, you might want to replace the engine. I
have heard ONLY bad things about GEX, and my one experience with them was
also a bad one- this guy was trying to get rid of a beautiful bus, but
the engine was bad. Yup, it was a GEX with only 10,000 miles on it. 
Anyway, that's my .02
