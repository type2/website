&gt; Hi believe that you have changed the gas filler tube seals because you

Yes, that's the reason I'm currently working on it. This USUALLY
happens on a full or mostly full tank of gas and then a hard left
turn.
 
&gt; I have this problem too, I appreciate if you can send me the procedure to
&gt; change theses seals.

What year do you have?  They SHOULD be mostly the same.  I have 
a '78 fuel injected van.  I had to remove the air filter and 
big S manifold and a bunch of electronics off of the cover plate.
I also pulled the computer module and the 10 inch wide circular
cover that goes over it's mounting area.  I'm also working through
the top access hatch over the engine.  NOTE: PULL THE BATTERY OUT
BEFORE WORKING ON IT!!  ALSO LEAVE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AIR
OUT FOR SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE PUTTING THE BATTERY BACK IN TO AVOID
EXPLOSIAN AND/OR FIRE!!!

This gives you access to the filler pipe.  You can then pull the
hose clamps off of the hose on the tank end of the pipe.  Then pull
the screws out of the gas cap end under the gas cap.  You should be 
able to work the tank end free then pull the whole unit back into
the engine compartment.  NOTE: the rubber flange under the gas cap
is about $16 US but the gas tank rubber hose is $85 US, but
you can substitute other gas resistant hose for it.

Installation should be the reverse of removal. &lt;GD&amp;R&gt;  Be sure to 
get the rubber parts oriented on the steel filler pipe as closely
to the position of the old ones as possible.  Now carefully work
the flange back out through the filler  hole and put every thing
back together.

This is as I understand it.  I'm waiting for the flange to come in. &lt;G&gt;
