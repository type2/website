Subject: Why I drive a Bus

Hi Folks,

I drive a Bus for several reasons:

1. Extreme cool factor - people smile, wave, flash the Peace sign, and ask 
about it.

2. Ease of repair - armed with all the manuals, all the tools, and The List, 
I can fix 'most anything myself.

3. Great hauling capacity - I packed all of my belongings into it for a 
cross-country move, I haul all of my band's gear, and I help friends move 
whenever they need me.

4. Amazing camping capability in a small package - how many RV's can park in 
a parking garage, and how many cars have a sink, stove, and refrigerator?

5. Fahrfergnugen!  Literally translated, &quot;Driving Fun.&quot;  A Bus is a very 
unique and enjoyable driving experience.  Few cars on the road today require 
such a degree of attention to the mechanical workings of the vehicle.

6. VW people are great!  Thanks to all of the great folks here on The List, 
I went from being an aircooled newbie to being a Bus mechanic.  Every Bus 
owner I've met has been friendly and very willing to share their Bus 
experience.

As always, YMMV.
Good Luck!
