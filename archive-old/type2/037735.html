&gt;         I took the bus  to work this morning after an all night rain/wet
&gt;  snow.
&gt;  Noticed that when i put the bus in reverse the brake warning light came on!
&gt;  After poping outta rever. into first it went out .
&gt;  Next noticed that selecting left hand signal that the brake warning light
&gt;  would flash in unison with the signals!
&gt;  Tried right hand signals and it worked fine.
&gt;  
&gt;  Does anyone think this may be rear tail/brake lights getting moisture in
&gt;  them?
&gt;  Just got home and it's dark so will have to drive the Chr*sler tommorrow.
&gt;  Any other thoughts? I pushed on the relays on the fuse panel as i was
&gt;  driving thinking there may be a prob
&gt;  there but no change.
&gt;  
&gt;  Could anyone give me some suggestions as to where to start troubleshooting
&gt;  this snag?
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks Alot

Hi Pat,

Just clean up all the connections on the rear light clusters and check and 
clean the earth wires in particular.
It sounds like the earth is bad so its finding its way to an alternative 
earth which happens to be the brake warning light.

Good Luck
