thanks to all who replied!

if you didn't have your email addy in the body of yer message, then outlook
express hid it from me and you didn't get a CC

it looks like i should switch to 20w50 or 10w40. I also have a fram oil
filter on at the moment, which i don't particularly like. i could tell it
doesn't flow as well when i was filling it with oil before installation, as
well as a mahle filter from busdepot (i had run out of mahle filters at the
time of my last oil change (when i had gas in the oil due to leaky
injector)). so i'll switch filters also.

i have adjusted my hydraulic lifters numerous times in the few months i've
had this motor (per bentley), including just previous to my most recent
compression test. all i can say is, sometime some of the lifter(s) are a
little soft.

i will also fiddle with my idle adjust. screw a little bit, per sean
bartnik.  sean: i drive my bus daily, and at home i park on a slight grade
(nose down). i'm sure that doesn't help them lifters pump up at all.

mark fitzsimons: with the rebuild (or since): cleaned FI grounds, found no
vac leaks so left well enuff alone, tested all FI components per bentley,
new fuel injectors all round, new plugs, slightly used wires, new cap rotor,
i had pertronix already. checked idle timing and for proper advance with a
strobe. i've bypassed the cold start injector (disconnected wire and one
long fuel line from left rail to right) cuz i don't like it (never worked on
my bus, starts fine without it, so who needs it?). both temp sensors were a
little bit outta spec, but not much, still want to replace temp II, but
don't want a new afm just for a temp I that's a little outta spec. AFM guts
don't look worn out. alternator, battery and cables were replaced shortly
before removing the old motor. new thermostat, cable, and pulley, tho i
can't seem to get them to close the flaps after cool down, pulley doesn't
turn without coersion(i know i know i know i need to fix that, but that's
why i warm it up in the driveway)

did i miss anything??  does it sound like i'm on the right track??
switch to 20w50 or 10w40, mahle filter instead of fram, R+R temp II, and
fiddle with idle adjust??  if all else fails call AVP and see what's up.

thanks again for all the helpful replies, it looks like i might have a
little time at home to fiddle with things because a snowstorm's a-blowin in,
and nobody does anything in NC if there's snow on the roads. us southern
boys don't got nuff plows to function down here.  :)  that's how it seems to
me anyways.

BTW, that orange westy i saw broken down near my house last night was still
there tonite, and it's not the westy that lives off the hilsboro exit of 40,
i saw that one too today. hmmmm, i wonder if he needs help. i'll prolly
leave a note on the windshield tomoro, if i can get outta the driveway that
is.


peace!
