All this talk about seatbelts reminded me that maybe someone on the list
has done this before.   I have a 78 &quot;empty box&quot; that is front seats but
none in the back as I use it for work and haul &quot;Stuff&quot;  however I would
like to find one or two small folding seats that can be put in behind the
drivers seat.  I have an area 21 inches wide, was thinking of something
&gt;from the back of an extended cab pickup (non VW) preferably I would like
a seat that can have the seatback folded down or the seat itself lifted up
for storage underneath.  

if anyone has done something similar or knows of a good design I should
look for when I go down to the &quot;pic n pull&quot; I would appreciate it.

Thank
Bob
