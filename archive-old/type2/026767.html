&gt;Kennedy Engineering puts out an adapter for a Toyota engine called a &quot;3TC,&quot;
&gt;but I don't know what kind of engine that is.

I believe this was one of the engines offered in the Corolla.  You can see this engine in a loaf (called the RoadCow) at www.mcn_dot_org/b/roadcow/picts.html.

I believe the recommendation from Kennedy on using the Subaru Legacy 2.2L 16-valve engine is for the Vanagon but it should also work in a loaf providing you hook up a radiator (the biggest problem with putting a water-cooled engine in a loaf).
