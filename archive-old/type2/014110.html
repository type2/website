Subject: Re: [T2] Engine problems :(

I think you got a broken oil ring on your low cylinder, most likley broke
the piston ring lands between the second and third ring. I'd definately
pull the head and look. Otherwise you've got the head off already look
for a valve cracked or a seat about to drop.

&gt; Well, I just tested the compression on my engine and it was 120, 30, 
&gt; 120, 120.  So, I guess I better drop the compression on those high 
&gt; ones 
&gt; cuz otherwise I'm gonna blow those heads off!!
&gt; 
&gt;   -- just kidding :) --
&gt; 
&gt; But, yeah, so, I'm down to 30psi.  Not too thrilling.  I adjusted 
&gt; the 
&gt; valves on my #4 cylinder (the 30 one) and it didn't make a 
&gt; difference. 
&gt; I hear a wierd knocking noise coming from the engine so I don't know 
&gt; 
&gt; what's up.  The piston is still moving (felt it with a screw driver) 
&gt; so 
&gt; I don't think a rod is broken.  It's a 78 with hydraulic lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
