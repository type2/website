I first met Josh at BBTA #12. I remember I was doing something to my Bus
when up walked Josh and introduced himself. It took about 2 seconds for me
to feel the warmth and caring that was Josh. Every so often we would talk on
the list and share thoughts. Seeing and talking to Josh at BBTA #14 was like
a reunion with an old friend. Please pass my condolences to his wife and
family and let them know that Josh was loved and respected by a whole
world-wide family.

I lost a friend- Heaven gained some goodness. Go with God Josh. With love-
