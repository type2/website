Subject: Re: [T2] TCWBC Trip Report

Very nice !!!
Questions:
1) Did you have to defrost those dudes with the &quot;malfunction door&quot; van 
in the morning ?
2) I've been told that some Canadian folks were making a (small 
controlled) fire wood under  their engine to warm it up during extreme 
cold, Is is true ????

Your pictures really remind me the call of nature to go skiing in Tahoe 
(CA) with my Westy , no hookup to run any  heater thought , candles and 
extra layers of anything worm will make it.
