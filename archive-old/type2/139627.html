Subject: my rant for the year

Folks(and I'm not picking on Don or Jason here either).

It seems like half of the posts lately have been dealing with electrical 
and battery issues....we got folks that are ready to suicide and sell 
their buses cause they can't get the wiring and electrical issues 
resolved.

My *personal* opinion and experience is to make the electrical system
*as new* before almost anything else.  You may have a fresh engine with 
500hp, but if you can't get it started, then what's the point?

Total outlay if you have a new/good battery might be $50 for new primary 
battery cables and some sandpaper or wire wheel for your dremel.  

Make those 30 year old battery cables *new*  they've done their job for a 
long time, so tossem and start over....and *don't* buy the leaded 
connector ones...buy the ones that look like the ones in your newer car.

While I like to keep my bus &quot;vintage&quot;, it doesn't mean I can't upgrade 
critical components that are a &quot;better idea&quot; and just plain work better.

Get the $1 little green and red felt &quot;anti corrosion&quot; pads that go under 
the battery...every one has them in the battery section and *they work*.

Look...no *really* look at the ground wires everywhere...green colored 
around the spade lug?.._dot_can't see shiny copper?
Get *good* new spade lugs and the proper tool and change them out...you 
might cut 1/4&quot; off the wire...ya still got plenty of wire and you have a 
NEW uncoroded connection(after you wire brush or sandpaper the ground lug).

Bought a new battery?...Don't put it in till you charge it 
overnight....most batteries *really* need a good charge before you put 
them in service....and the manufacturer will tell you the same.

Do it! Do it now!&lt;grin&gt;

-end of rant-

Cheers, dave
