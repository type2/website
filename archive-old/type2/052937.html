Subject: Re: cv joint clip

For those too cheap or too lazy to go to the FLAPS for circlip pliers, I
have taken needlenose pliers and ground down the tips into a flat shape
on the outside to allow gripping the inside flats of the circlip. 
Trouble is, while this works for wimpy circlips, you need good muscles
to do the pulling apart of the plier handles to open the circlip on a cv
axle!  The pliers you buy for this open up as you squeeze them.
