&gt; Yes. No double relay, no pump action.
&gt;
&gt; Disconnecting the AFM won't disable the pump during start. Contacts in the
&gt; AFM hold the pump on in the run mode.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;On a remote starter switch, since the bus should be switched off, and all
&gt; &gt;you are applying power to is the starter motor, the fuel pump (on FI
&gt; &gt;engines) won't run.
&gt;
&gt; The double relay is wired to the battery and to pin 30 on the starter. The
&gt; pump should (I haven't tested it) run if the remote starter switch stitches
&gt; starter pin 50 to starter pin 30. No key needed.

Chuck,

Looking at the wiring diagram, what you say makes a lot of sense.  I don't
remember it actually functioning this way, but that may be a screwup in my
bus' wiring.  I think the safe option if you don't want the pump to run is
to unplug the double relay no matter whether you are cranking from the
switch or using a remote starter.  That disconnects all possibility of
power to the pump.
