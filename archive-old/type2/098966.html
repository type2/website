&lt;&lt; I am looking for information from anyone on how difficult it is to install
&gt;an alfa boxer engine into a vw van. Mine is a 69 bay camper. Wondering where
&gt;to purchase (or make from drawings)adapter plates etc &amp; where the best place
&gt;would be to mount the radiator. Any info appreciated. Situated in Dublin.

I'd do some research on that engine, first. I'll assume it's the larger 
(1600cc
and up) engine. They tend to put out the horses at high revs in a light car...
pretty much the opposite of a bus...
