Subject: Re: [T2] loss of power and really bad sound

&gt; Cracked dizzy cap or rotor, points block broke, dizzy clamp not tight and
&gt; timing slipped, fuel pump failing, clogged fuel filter, loose wire on
coil,
&gt; piece of junk clogged a jet in the carb. Those are just some of the
&gt; possibles off the top of my head.
 Well, got home and found the #2 spark plug popped out.  I put it back in
and the bus runs fine.  Is there any problems that this could have caused or
issues to look into
Steve
