Bascially, one of three things:  To much pressure from the fuel pump,
which then pushes the needle valve down, and the loat along with it.
Using an FI pump on carbs can do this........

Or, both of your floats are stuck.  Try tapping the side of the carbs, in
the area of the bowl, and try again.  If that doesnt work, pop the tops,
and investigate further.

Could also be that both of your needle valves are stuck open.  Pop the
tops, and check.

just FYI:  the fuel goes into the carbs from the pump, and through a
little needle valve.  this valve is closed when there is enough fuel in
the bowl to &quot;float&quot; the float.  the float presses against the needle, and
closes it, which stops the flow of fuel...unless there is too much
pressue, and the valve cannot close, or the float is not floating, or the
needle valve is stuck.

It's a fairly simple system, if you stare at it long enough..:)

And the reason the gas is going out of that upward slanted tube is because
that is the easiest place for it to escape...be proud of your top-to-base
gaskets!:)

later...david
