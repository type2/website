&gt; I'd like to throw a curveball at this conversation. I have a '71 with an

&gt; you've got me thinking about the SVDA. But what's the best way to add in a
&gt; vacuum port with the Kadrons on there? There's a T leading from the brake
&gt; booster to the vacuum ports on the carb manifolds. So is this as simple as
&gt; adding another small T for the distributor? Are there good and bad places
&gt; to do that?

Nope!  The vacuum line to the distributor comes from a port very close to
the throttle butterfly.  It doesn't read manifold vacuum alone!  What it
does read is a combination of throttle position and manifold vacuum.  Very
tricky!

A port can be added to most carburators, but the placement is very
critical and should be left to the carb gurus who really know what they
are doing.  A millimeter misplacment will screw up the advance curve!
