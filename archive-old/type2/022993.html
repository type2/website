&gt;According to VW, it's not required.  However it certainly is a good idea
&gt;to change it.  VW determined that it's not required during the expected
&gt;life of the transmission.  We often go above and beyond that expected
&gt;life, so it's good to change the oil every now and then.

So what is the &quot;expected life&quot;? I have read that it is around 200,000 
miles. I have 130,000 miles on my tranny now, and 30,000 on a new rebuild. 
I am hoping that the tranny will last until the next rebuild. It makes a 
distinct whining noise while I am driving, but does not &quot;howl&quot; yet or pop 
out of gear. I am saving my pennies for a Rancho Performance rebuild. :~)

Thanks for your quick response. I was able to get the tranny serviced on my 
lunch break today. This list rocks! Since I don't know the condition of the 
seals (though they are not leaking) I chose to go with a conventional GL4. 
Only one readily available was an 80w90 so that is what was in there. The 
tranny oil was VERY dark compared with the new fluid, and there were lots 
of metal flakes on the magnet, and one or two sizeable chunks (2mm or so). 
Anything I should be concerned about?
