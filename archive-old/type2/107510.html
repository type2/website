Subject: RE: [T2] Help: Looking for a throttle microswitch for a 1977 VW
  Van

I looked in Bentley, and it agrees that a true 77 has no microswitch, but a
late 76 might.

The old &quot;throttle valve switch&quot; was removed after vin# 226 2077 583, but the
&quot;microswitch&quot; was used for a short while after that, then it went away
leaving no electrical switch on the throttle assembly.

My '77 is CA, and is VIN# 237 2092 XXX, which is well past the cutover. My
ECU P/N :022-906-021AA

Also, you might have a '77 bus which acquired a '76 engine at some point...


&lt;SNIP&gt;
It seems that for one year only and only for Californian models the
'throttle valve switch' (which is sometimes used as a full throttle switch
but sometimes used with more functions) was replaced with something called a
'microswitch' which only had a full throttle function.  I think this is what
I need.  One worry I have about using anything else (i.e. perhaps I could
convert to the system that was used in 1976 or 1978 is that I do not know
what else was different on this 1977 California engine - maybe the ECU
exchange for example??)
