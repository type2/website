BusBoys,

I checked out your site and, ummmm.....what updates? I
keep looking for photos to compare parts on my bus (it
gets rather expensive, as well as frustrating,
shipping parts back and forth when they don't fit),
but there are the same amount of pics/diagrams as
before &lt;very few&gt;.

This is why I no longer order parts from you. There
are just too many variations of the &quot;same&quot; part for
even the same model year (especially Westphalia
equipment) to run the risk.

Sorry guys, let me know when you get some photos for
comparison and we'll talk.

Also, why do you not have secure ordering for the
internet? There are bus-owners all over the world who
need parts (and there really aren't that many
sources), but can't call during business hours &lt;myself
included&gt; and don't want to wait for snail-mail.... 

It seems like a waste to be on the internet and only
go halfway....

Just my opinion.


Jaime
