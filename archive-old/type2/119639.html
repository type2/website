&quot;Killing a fly with a Louisville Slugger&quot;--:&gt;0

Good One Tom---:&gt;)

Agreed there for sure Terry. The angle grinder is a blunt force trauma
item, like killing a fly with a Louisville Slugger! It hits too large of
an area. I ended up taking vast swathes off the front paint on my bus,
and pretty much brush painting it with Rustoleum type paint. Not too
fine a grade of work, but most of the surface rust spots have not rebled
through. I like the way the metal looks after cleaning it with the wire
wheel, it just glows and gleams, unlike the rough look of the quarter
sized spots from the blaster, not to mention the racket of my compressor
hammering away in the background. I just found that the spot blaster was
taking too long for what I had to do. I agree that for spot refinishing
rivets it would be ideal. It's there in my armoury for when I need it.

&lt;Problem is with my 4&quot; 3/4 horse Milwaukee grinder is it removes waaaay
too much metal beyond where the corroded area's are--same with my 6' or
3&quot; air grider--- 
I'm pretty happy with the unit I have--and for focused rust spot clean
up and paint prep you just can't beat it-- 
Later, 
Terry&gt;
