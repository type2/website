&gt; &gt; well couple years ago I put in a Pertronix and the dwell is rock steady

&gt; Will the Ignitor II work with a 78?  Not much info at the Pertronix site and
&gt; some suppliers I found show n/a for 75-78 busses and only list the original

not sure about the Ignitor, got my Pertronix from Bus Depot (I'm pretty
sure) and they sent me the right one for my 78 with stock dizzy
