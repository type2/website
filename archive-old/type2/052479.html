Subject: Re: [T2] Front Rubber Needed (231 867 765)

&gt;1978 Westy; need the rubber mats which surround the seat pedestals and
cover
&gt;the little storage areas under the seats, part # from orig is 231 867 765.

I got mine from Wolfsburg West, which were of good quality.  They also have
a very nice cocoa mat for the front floor.
