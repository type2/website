&gt; they slowly die?

Most of the points replacement parts that I have heard of failing have 
been a sudden loss of it's ability to open and close the circuit. I do 
know that Mark Dearing had an issue with one similar unit that started 
to act strange before dying, but that is the only time I have personally 
heard of it's slowly going out.

&gt; It starts, just dies when coming up to a Stop Sign or Red Light.
&gt; 
&gt; Trying to get to the Root Cause........

With that in mind, I would first check for a vacuum leak. Those leaks 
tend to start messing with the idle first.
