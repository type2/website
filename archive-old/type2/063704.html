Subject: Trip Report: Yellowstone et. al.

Hey now,
     I'm writing beside the fire again. Haven't done this since Stillwater
cove campground in CA over a month ago. It is 9:15, 16 August, we are at the
Sinks Canyon state park, Wyoming. The canyon walls reach high above us,
creating a frame for the evening stars, while the Popo Agie river flows
busily past. And smoke from the fire blows in my eyes...    ;-) All  in all
this is one of the best campsites we've had this entire trip, and it's only 4
bucks. I like Wyoming... ;-)
     We left Spokane early on the morning of the 14th, and drove through
northern Idaho and Montana, en route to Yellowstone. We ended up camping out
behind a Conoco station just off the interstate. They've made themselves a
little RV campground back there, but it doesn't seem to be much of a hit.
With about 30 spaces, we had the place to ourselves. Not a destination, but
ok for 6 dollars. 
      The Conoco station is about 110 miles from West Yellowstone, and we got
a late start, so we didn't get into Yellowstone until about 1pm on the 15th.
Basically we ran in a circle around the park, checking out all the hot
springs and whatnot, taking pictures of the wildlife, and generally being
tourists. I finally got a close look at the VW/Winnebago Rialta while in
Yellowstone, interesting vehicle. I'll stick with an aircooled Westy, thank
you... We went to see Old Faithful at about 5:30, and Old Faithful wasn't
going to go until 6:42. We still had no campsite, but decided to hang around
and take our chances. We figured we'd get something down towards Grand Tetons
NP. We saw Ol' Faithful, along with about 600 other tourists. It looked like
some of those pictures you see of Yosemetie, with traffic jams. I'm not sure
I like being that packed in when trying to enjoy nature. Ol' Faithful blew,
and so did we, south towards the Tetons.
     We hit Flagg Ranch campground-a private campground just between
Yellowstone and the Tetons-with the knowledge that they had a few sites left,
and that the rest of the place was packed. The nice girl working the desk
told me of the 18 dollar price tag, and commiserated with me on the status of
highway robbery in america today. Then she told me of Forest Service
campgrounds nearby. They don't have water, but they're free. Free is a good
word. We tanked up on water and headed down the dirt road, as the sun set. It
was about 8 pm, and we didn't have to go far at all. Only 1.5 miles from
Flagg Ranch was a small campground, only 4 spaces, and only 2 occupied. Just
off the Snake river, this was an excellent place, and we set up camp. A very
interesting vehicle occupied the site next to us, but we couldn't really
investigate until this morning.
      What was that vehicle, you may ask? Get this. A 1927 Chevy, &quot;renewed&quot;,
as it's owners like to say. Mr. Sunny Baba and Mrs. Prarrie Rose, of Twin
Lakes, CO, graciously let us ogle at thier vehicle, and even told us where
the local hot springs were. ;-) Sunny did all the work himself, and he really
did a marvelous job. The original steel body-no bondo-was widened 6.5 feet,
lengthened 6 feet, the firewall recessed 6 inches. Why? For the new 4.3 liter
Chevy V6, of course, which powers  a 4 speed Chevy truck tranny, with a 5:13
Ford 3/4 ton rear end. He gets 15 mpg pulling 9k pounds-including the
trailer, which has their portable organic garden. The wheels are
spoked-hickory-wood, and the body is of Pennsylvania red oak. It has an oak
and pine interior, sleeps 2. It is equipped with solar powered lights, music
and refigerator, and a propane stove and oven. The windows are all beautiful
stained glass, all of it done by the owners. The quality on this job is just
unbelievable, they've really done it up right. The project took about 11
months start to finish, and they live in it at the moment. They're in the
process of buying a piece of land at Twin Lakes, CO, so they're selling their
baby. Only 40K. If I had that kind of cash I might consider it, although I'm
more the type to go with making it myself. I'll post some of the pictures I
took whenever I get the film developed.
     After taking our leave from Sunny and Prarrie, we did the tour of the
Tetons. Really georgeous place, but we still think that Kings Canyon holds
the prize... We waded a bit in Jenny Lake, checked out Summit Peak, and saw
the Church of the Transgression, then headed for 287 south. And that's how we
ended up here. I just looked at the map, and a state park seemed like a good
place to try-I figured it would beat KOA hands down, and might even be
cheaper. I was right. 
     Tomorrow we will visit with Stuart Habel, his girlfriend Kit, and thier
cat. Stuart graciously responded to our request for places to stay, and
offered his residence in Denver. So that's where we're going. The night after
that we will see my sister in Clovis, NM, and the following night we will be
home. That makes this our last night of camping, so I'm very pleased that it
is in such a wonderful and affordable setting. Next time we come through
Wyoming we might want to stay here an extra day or so... So I guess that's it
for now. &quot;I'm gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul...&quot;
Peace, 
Eddie
