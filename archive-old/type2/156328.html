Subject: Re: [T2]tranny/transaxle oil fill bolt

ok thank you 
  i was able to find it in the beetle haynes manual as a oil level plug and then later as a oil filler plug.. and the torque for that says 14ftpounds...
  i also crawled under bus with torque wrench and was able to set torque to 14 ft pounds and it clicked so guessing thats good...(i doubt the tranny in the bus has ever been checked or loosemned but the beetle has a fairly new transaxle in it...
  just checking level in them both.. 
   
   
   
  thanks
  chai

&gt; i dont know if they would be the same and if 18ft pounds would be enough?
&gt;

That is a tapered thread. I think 18fp is TOO MUCH. 10-12 is plenty. 
Just firm a firm hand on a short throw, not tight is right. I always 
use a short handled hex key or a shorty ratchet or a shorty wrench 
which is plenty tight not to back out.
