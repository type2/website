Subject: Drag link: Nylock nuts?



&gt; Second, the rod end threads aren't drilled for castellated nuts, so
&gt; there is no way of positively locking the nuts in place.  The drag link
&gt; is supplied with nylon locking nuts, so I suppose that this is locking
&gt; enough for this application.
&gt;
&gt; The fact that this isn't positive bothers me a bit, so I decided to put
&gt; a question to the list:
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone experienced a nylock nut in such an application getting
&gt; loose?  Let's not count nuts that have been reused, which is bad
&gt; practice for this type of fastener.

Mercedes has gone the nylock nut route about 5 years ago. I have never seen
one come loose yet. Don't forget, the taper also holds it together, it's a
friction fit.
