Subject: Broken fuel sender wire


With spring semi-firmly entrenched, I decided
to tackle fixing my fuel guage. I had
ordered a sending unit last month from
the Bus Depot and figured it was time to
toss it in.

Naturally, after cutting a hole in
the hatch, I've determined the sender
is fine. I've shorted out the gauge
and got it to move, so I assume it's
ok as well.
 
Do I try to find where the wire is broken?
If so, where is it most likely to be?
 
Or should I just run new wires from the gauge to
the sender?
 
This seems to be one of those &quot;I've see it
break there 100 times&quot; sort of questions :)
