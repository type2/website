Subject: Re: Starting Problem '78 FI Engine

Check your fuel pressure.  If your pressure regulator has gone south, 
the symptoms you describe can be the result.

If you find that your fuel pressure rapidly drops to 0 after turning off 
the engine, then get uder the car with your vice-grips, sized to gently 
squeeze closed the fuel return line, and have someone start up the car 
again.  The instant they turn it off, clamp down on the vice-grips.  If 
your fuel pressure stays high (or falls to 0 much more slowly than 
before) you've found your problem.

&gt; I get decent cranking with new solenoid relay, but, engine cold, I have
&gt; to crank for a while, stop and crank again before engine fires. Last
&gt; resort, I squirt starting fluid into air cleaner for a decent start.
&gt; Engine hot, I get no start with any amount of cranking, and have to
&gt; resort to starting fluid, which barely gets her to fire up after a
&gt; persistant crank.
&gt; 
&gt; Once running my re-built GEX engine with 56K miles on it runs strong and
&gt; cool.  I've checked thermo-time and put in brand new cold start valve.
&gt; Points, distributor, plugs are new, timing and dwell checked and
&gt; adjusted.  Have not checked fuel pressure, but put in new fuel pump
&gt; which I'd been keeping as a spare.  Head temp sensor was new about five
&gt; years ago. Will check air temp sensor.  Would appreciate any ideas on
&gt; this puzzle. It's driving me crazy!
