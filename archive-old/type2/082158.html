Subject: Re: [T2] 69 paint color

Hiya Eric,

First off do know that I am not the last word in paints or their application 
to VW Busses.  Perhaps someone on the List with more experience in that area 
would care to chime in.  That being said, let me tell you what I do 
know..........  The historical usage of paint is a sketchy area at best.  You 
see many of the lists which describe just when a certain color was used do 
not cite the sources of their information.  And that makes all the difference 
in the world.  It is COMMON for paint application lists from paint 
manufacturers to have mistakes concerning the year of production.  In the 
list that I referenced, for example, Lotus White (L282) was listed as being 
applied up to VIN 218059936 in the 68 model year.  Paint manufacturers 
apparently often go by a calendar year while the manufacturer (in this case, 
VW) goes by a production year with different dates.  VW started production of 
the 69 model year on August 1, 1968 (So, you see that your Bus with a 
production date of Jan. 7, 1969 was not that early in the run).
