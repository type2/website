&gt;Today I installed the ammeter and I observed the following right after 
&gt;installation:
&gt;
&gt;1) Everything off, the needle was right on 0
OK

&gt;2) Lights on with engine off, the needle deflected to the negative side
OK

&gt;3) Engine running with all electrical loads off, the needles is on 0

Shouldn't there be a slight charge?

&gt;went positive when
&gt;I reved-up the engine. I turned on the lights and radio and it went to the 
&gt;negative side

Not enough revs
&gt;
&gt;Then I start to drive and the needle was on the negative side, deflecting 
&gt;more when
&gt;accelerating,

Regulator dropped out


until I stop at a red light. The needle went to the
&gt;positive side and suddenly
&gt;jumped to +60Amps!

Regulator overshooting putting out generator max.


Like there is a short circuit but charging! I
&gt;depress the accelerator
&gt;and the needle went back to 0 on the negative side.

Reg working again.

&gt;
&gt;Does anybody have an idea what might be wrong?

My guess is the regulator is having problems overcoming the added voltage 
drops of the longer wire, the added connector drop at the starter plus the 
amp meter drop. The regulator only has around a 1 volt range. 10 amps and a 
resistance of 0.1 OHM = 1 volt. Minimize the added resistance.
