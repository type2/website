  dipstick oil temp sensor

Arnaud,

We need some good pics of your engine.

I am having trouble with the idea that your oil gets  hot, but your 
heads don't appear to be getting hot.....you are correct about checking 
the oil cooler for obstructions...especially if I remember that this 
engine sat up for quite awhile...  mouse nests?

You must get the hoover bit in there!...or just try duck taping around it 
for a short test.

If I remember correctly, you already said that all engine sealing rubber 
was replaced.....???


Check fan belt tension...generally more of a problem than folks 
realize....make it tight!  Cooling fan clean? and clear of leaves/rags and 
other debris?

Check valve adjustment one more time...makes a big difference.

Correct heat range spark plugs?...NON-platinum!

Air tubes to heater boxes good?  Heater boxes leaking at speed?...in other 
words all your cooling air is going out the ports to your heater boxes...

Disconnect paper air hoses(for a test) and cover the fan shroud air holes 
very well...VWFLAPS sell plugs for this for a few bucks...or use several 
layers of duct tape....just for a test.

You should easily be able to do at least 65 on flat roads all day long.

Brakes dragging?(more load on engine).

Yes, take the engine out and check for an oil cooler that has gunk all 
over the outside(inside).  

Thermostat operational???? and correctly set up?....take it off 
totally(make sure flaps are open totally) and  go for a drive...any better?
Reread how to adjust it in Bentley...I did it wrong for years.

Exhaust in good shape?...or leaking back towards engine compartment.
Use your hands to check for exhaust leaks after you start a cold engine
Let us know!

On your bus, pulling the engine enough to get to the oil cooler and then 
pulling it and cleaning it is a Saturday job....but! at the end of the 
day, you should have it cleaned, back together and gone for a test drive.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Aircoolers,

&gt; Still not sure whether my bus is overheating or whether that's the way
&gt; it is stock/old/cheaply-rebuilt.
&gt; 
&gt; I did 350 miles this week end with air temps between 70 and 100
&gt; degrees. Bus loaded. Here are a few observations (in no particular
&gt; order). Gene Bergo oil sensor (on at 227 degrees /off otherwise) and
&gt; VDO heads temp gauge. Here &quot;getting hot&quot; = oil reaches 227 degrees.

Lots snipped here
