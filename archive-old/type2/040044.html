&lt;&lt;  I just tried to have my 81 Westy insured as an RV (that is in
 Delaware if it makes any difference). It needed a fixed build-in toilette
 to qualify as a RV. So it seems it needs all of the above mentioned items.

I have my 77 Westy insured as a RV and all it has is the Camper Top and the 
Cabinits. In fact they never even asked what it had in it. I am in Washington 
State and have State Farm Insurance. Oh, and it is ALOT cheaper being listed 
as a RV than as a regular van. Guess they figure you wouldn't be driving an 
RV as much.
