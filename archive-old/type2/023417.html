Subject: spare key

A few months ago, having lost my key, I pulled a door handle and went to
have a key made. It worked like a charm on all the doors, but would not
start the bus. Luckily the old key turned up and I compared them. Turns out
the new key lacked a certain cut, so I now store this key (in an unmentioned
place;) in case I lock my keys in...the deviant j*rk can get in, but can't
take her anywhere (unless they can hotwire...and what joy-rider knows how?)
                   FWIW
                       Snave
