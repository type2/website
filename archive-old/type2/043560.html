A1.  This is for the reverse lights.  The connector goes on the + side of the coil.

A2.  Don't know this one.

&gt; Q1.  There's this black wire with a VW inline fuse running from the firewall
&gt; to nowhere on the drivers side of my 72 1700 engine.    It has a female
&gt; connector on the end and comes into the engine compartment with a few other
&gt; wires which go to the coil.  Any guesses where it should connect to?
&gt; 
&gt; Q2.  How does the fuel gauge work?  My gauge reads ok when the tanks full
&gt; (it shows it as being over 3/4) but when the tank gets down to around half
&gt; or less, the gauge jumps around, pegging both ends, frantically.  It doesn't
&gt; seem to do it as bad when the car is on but not running.  Thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help!
