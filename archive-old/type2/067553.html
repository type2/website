Ah yes... but don't forget the &quot;Ramp Side&quot; which came with the side 
folding &quot;doors&quot;. The engine compartment was lower than the VW, so a load 
could be accomadated. Unfortunately, not that many VW PUs were sold, and 
fewer Corvair models.

Other than the engine, these are VERY reliable vehicles. The engines 
were good for about 60-80K before they would start to cause problems... 
but then the VW engine is known to blow valves at 50K. Its biggest 
problem was there were too few &quot;experts&quot; and an overhaul cost more than 
that of the VW... as much as $1K.

I owned a few back in the 70s. They were fun to drive, but didn't sell 
well. They didn't attract VW owners, and &quot;American&quot; drivers wouldn't buy 
them.
