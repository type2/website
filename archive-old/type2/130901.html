Subject: Westy/Camper flooring questions

     First question, did the campers have a plywood sheet layed over the 
corrugated flooring?  I was told that was the case, and that sounds like the 
best way to get carpet and other floor coverings to lay flat.  If so, how 
thick of a piece is this?

     Second question, how durable are the laminate floorings?  Anybody think 
that might be a good flooring option?  I was thinking that it would look 
pretty slick in there to have a laminate hardwood flooring look.  I will 
probably end up going with something a little more conventional, like 
linoleum, but I was just thinking of it and thought I'd ask.
