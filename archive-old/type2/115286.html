Subject: Safety Inspection Failure Stories

Quick, while the list administrator is looking for excessive quoted lines, 
and auction items, answer this:

Interesting vignette on why you failed a SAFETY inspection:

Yes, it's a FART...



Me:

Failed safety inspection because I did not have an EGR filter.


Failed safety inspection because horn did not blow.  At that time, the wheel 
had to be turned 1/3 turn to the right to get a good ground. So I could only 
blow the horn during a right hand turn.


Failed safety inspection because windshield defrost vent had no air flow.  
At that time, the air blower was disconnected, and I had to turn the engine 
on to get some feel-able air to the front defrost vent.


Failed safety inspection because my front lens on the driver and passenger 
door were inoperable (1978 VW type 2 = reflectors, not lights)


Failed safety inspection because license plate light was inoperable.  (OK, 
this was a good one.  I changed it out before he got the red sticker on the 
VW, so I guess this is only a partial failure)


Failed safety inspection just because it was a VW bus (no, I am kidding....  
I just wanted to see if you were reading the whole thing...)
