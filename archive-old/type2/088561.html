Subject: Junkyard Find

Oh, frabjous day! Oh, wonder of wonders! I drove past a seedy little junk
yard/repair shop this morning and what to my wondering eyes did appear but a
77 Westy. A sight RARELY seen in western KY. It appears to be complete, some
fairly serous rust on the driver's side rockers, bottom of the doors, under
the windshield, but the floor is solid. Jalosie windows and all other glass
intact, seals fair. Seats fair to poor, westy interior all present and in
so-so condition. Partly dismantled FI engine installed and another one
sitting in the cargo area, including the FI parts and a plastic gas tank
sitting on the engine cover. The boss won't be back until Wednesday so I
can't get a price until then. The last registration expired in 96 as did the
license plate. Anyone care to hazard a guess as to what it's worth?  It's
not running since the FI is all disconnected, but it's definitely
resurrectable.

Just looking for off-the-top-of-your-head opinions.

Thanks,
Dave
