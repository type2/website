Subject: Won't be making EB this year

Things change and so do plans.  We had just a bit too much going on  
to try and get there without being stressed out at the same time.  A  
few people were wondering what our plans were and if we were making  
it.  For those going, enjoy the camp out and have a safe  
journey.....I'll be looking for those trip reports :)

Peace, Troy
