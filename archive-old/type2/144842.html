Subject: Re: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

We had a starter/generator combo on an Allis-Chalmers tractor when I 
was a kid. More lies
like Chrysler inventing the minivan when GM had the Greenbrier, VW had 
the Transporter
and Fiat had the Panorama/Multipla way, way before Chrysler has their 
FWD van. And those
flip away/hiding in the floor seats popular with the minivan folks? 
Nobody can say they
invented those in the past couple years. Fiat had those in their 
Multipla back in the
50s/60s. Same crap that makes the average person think Nader killed the 
Corvair. Nope it
was the success of the Corvair that led Ford to make the Mustang and 
then to keep up GM
had to build the Camaro. They couldn't stuff a V-8 in the rear of the 
Corvair and cubic
inches were everything in the 60's... And the useless ability to do 
burn outs - hard to
do in rear engine cars without effort - right?

I dislike marketting departments. Beyond big gloosy pics of cars they 
are awful - they
lie, lie, lie!!! &lt;grin!&gt; Maybe somebody needs to make a website or a 
book that dispells
the myths of antique cars. Chris
