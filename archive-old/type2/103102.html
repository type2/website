Subject: Steal Your Face VW Stickers

Hi Fred,

	Here you go.  Quiet though, don't let VWoA know....

  I just ordered from them about a week ago.  Quality on stickers and
patches is pretty good.  I am looking for the same design on a t-shirt.  If
you know where they can be had, let me know.

  question...
Message-ID: &lt;F115fQNoZy3uOSWoq9Q0001ed75_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I am looking for a Grateful Dead 'Steal your Face' sticker with the vw
emblem in the middle (this is the skull with a circular picture in the top,
for those Grateful Dead inept) Usually the skull was black on a clear
background sticker, and the vw emblem was red..

Apparently, they stopped making them. If any one knows of a place that has
them for sale, or if anyone has one stashed in a drawer with their old
tie-dyed tapestries, could you let me know?

Thanks,

Fred
