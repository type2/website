Subject: KC Swap Report - or How to Pack a Westy

I left Sunday morning around 6:30 A.M. with three friends in my 81
Westy. We were going from Des Moines, IA to Kansas City, MO for the
Mo-Kan swap meet. The GEX 2.0 liter air-cooled engine putted along fine
at 60mph for the trip down (against the wind). The new GEX with 4500
miles on it is doing great, although the two year old Monza muffler is
developing little holes in it.
        Finally around 9:45, after taking three wrong turns, we pulled up to
the community college outside Kansas City where the swap meet was being
held. Seemed like a good turnout. Great weather too - about 65degrees
and sunny (in direct contrast to the Spring KC swap meet 40 and rainy).
        I met Dan Kinsey from the list for the first time and picked up the 2/3
middle splitty seat I bought a month ago. I also bought a rocker trim
for a deluxe bus and the rear seat aluminum grab bar. I chatted with Jon
Christensen a bit - he was busy running around and then loading his
vanagon with all sorts of stuff (see his post) - we showed each other
photos of our buses. I also got to meet Bob Hufford and his father for
the first time - saw those pictures in person of that 64 deluxe they had
found in a Missouri barn. I also met another list member who gave me a
tour of his 63 singlecab (sorry, I've forgotten your name - write if you
read this) ongoing restoration. Very nice folks we have on this List...
        Well, when you bring three other VW nuts with you to a swap meet you
can expect to return with alot of stuff. Along with four people here is
what we had in/on the Westy.
        -Three beetle bumpers
        -Front Splitty bumper with overriders
        -Beetle all-metal roofrack
        -Splitty gas tank
        -entire door for a beetle
        -2/3 splitty middle seat
        -and other smaller items: 8hubcaps, license frame, trim pieces,
        empi mug

        This was the first time I had used the roof cargo hold above the cab of
the Vanagon - all the bumpers were strapped down on top (if you saw us
on Interstate 35 headed North that day, my vanagon looked like a bull
with horns - lots of strange looks from cars passing). It worked great -
made it back by 6 p.m. We averaged around 65mph on the way back with the
wind. Oh and if you want to know what speed the poptop opens at when you
forget to latch it completely down - 30mph...!!_at__at_#&amp;* This happened after
pulling out of the community college - luckily no damage - just scared
the two women in the back of the Vanagon to death. No other mishaps the
rest of the trip - a great day...
