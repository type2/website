&gt; Hello listmembers,
&gt;
&gt; I am ready to start soundproofing parts of my bus, however I remembered one
&gt; little thing I might need to do first and that's clean up some of the rust,
&gt; before I go and lay down rubber mats over the top of it. I'm guessing the
&gt; rust will just keep getting worse under there, except I won't be paying
&gt; attention to it till it gets really bad then.
&gt;
&gt; So I am a total novice when it comes to : _____, so I started sanding down
&gt; the rust a little. My question is, have I gone far enough, and what is the
&gt; correct next step?
&gt;
&gt; Once I have sanded it down far enough, its still bumpy, but not from the
&gt; rust bubbled up paint, but where the little groove is where the rust ate
&gt; away. Do I need to fill this in, before I primer it, or paint it? Or can I
&gt; just primer what's there and slap my dynamat down over it?
&gt;

Christopher:
Primer will do NOTHING to prevent rust, but rather enhance rust. Primer is made
to enhance adhesion of panit to bare metal and it also has a lot of
attractivness for water. (It draws the water into the surface just like it does
the paint.)
A good thing to coat it with would be POR-15. This is a tough (REALLY TOUGH)
waterproof coating that stops rust. This stuff is incredible. It needs no
topcoating to work. Look in the archives to find where to buy it.
