Subject: RE: RUST - front seat belt mounts

Anyone else found rust when they pulled up the pedestal mats for the seat
belt mounts closest to the door in the late model Bays?

Mine has two little rusty pimples about the diameter of a quarter.

Going to grind them down and spot weld a new piece of metal in I think.

Any other solutions out there?
Ciao!

Yup - I had the same thing in my '74, and I've heard of others having a
similar problem.  It must be the way they were assembled...  I ground mine
WAY down befor I was able to get to the bottom of the rust pit there really
was a nasty pocket of rust down there.  I filled the pit with a putty sold
by POR 15 (forget the name of the putty, sorry).  It sets up rock hard filed
it, sanded it and painted it with the rest of my bus.  Welding may be a
better option if you can fill that big pit.

Good luck,

Paul G
