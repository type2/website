Subject: Re: [T2] Hard start and dies when accelerator is pressed

Hello List,

Well, the problem that I wrote to you about a few days
ago is gone for now. I went outside this afternoon
during twilight to see if I could figure out why I had
such a hard time getting my engine to idle and
decelerate properly. I tried cranking the engine
again. THe engine would run momentarily and then die.
I grew tired of running back and forth from the
ignition switch to the distributor trying to set the
timing by ear. The engine died once again. Instead of
going back to the front of the bus to kill the switch,
I just pulled the hot wire from the coil. When I did
this I noticed a spark from the negative terminal on
the coil to the distributor wire connection in the
center. Well, I connected and disconnected this hot
wire several times and each time a spark was noted
from the other terminal. Evidently, there is a crack
or somthing in the plastic on the coil.  I swaped
coils. After I hooked up the spare coil, the problem
seemed to go away. I retimed it and it runs like a top
now! It does not mis nearly as much! To think, if I
had gone out side to work on the bus any earilyer, I
would not have seen the coil arc! I was starting to
think I had a grimlin living in my bus! Thanks for all
the replies to my question. I took your advice and
checked everything twice. 

Regards,

David Kelly

no driving miles on it after break in. Thanks in
advance for any
&gt; help!
