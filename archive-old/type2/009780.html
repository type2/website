Howdy from Texas-

This is my first post to this list...been lurkin' as the welcome email 
suggested to get a feel for it. Doesn't seem to be as anal as the &quot;rules&quot; 
suggest.  8)

I have a '70 Bus (&quot;Kenny&quot;) that was rear-ended by an uninsured motorist and 
it looks like my insurance company will be tied up with this guy for awhile 
before they let me start working on him. The rear bumper was pushed into the 
rear valance which was pushed into the exhaust.

Problems: Exhaust leak
          Shifter won't go into 2nd gear-all else is fine
          Cosmetic bolt-on damage
          drivers lower corner needs replaced.

Questions: Any ideas on the shifter not making it to 2nd
           gear? I don't see anything obvious.

           Anyone parting out an early bay-window who has
           the rear bolt-on pieces?

&quot;Kenny&quot; is family and we'll do what it takes to get him back on the road (I 
drove him home), but WE will do it and not a shop. We'll let a shop do the 
body welding and a complete repaint, but we'll do the rest. Thanx for 
reading this far!
