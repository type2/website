&quot;its only making a spark just after  I stop turning the key&quot;

Aha! When you say that there's no spark until the end, I remember that I had
this problem.  Before I tell you what my solution was, check the following;

            1)   Turn key to on position. Do you have 12 volts to positive
side of coil? i.e. not the side that connects to distributor.

            2)  Turn key to start position  - as the motor turns over - do
you still have 12 volts there?

Nothing further down the system  ( i.e. coil, distributor, wires, plugs,
spark) will work if there isn't 12 volts at the coil (both during the
starting and running position of the ignition switch) to be converted to High
Voltage.

I thought about this because I had this same symptom;  i.e. only one last
spark when I turned it off.  Which is pretty good proof that the rest of the
system is intact enough to make a spark, just that there's something
preventing it from continuing to fire.  My solution was to replace ignition
switch, but I'm reluctant to suggest that until I hear if you have the hot
start relay in place.  Maybe some else on the list can go on from here.

If you get the above symptoms and want to do an end run around the ignition
switch, you can run a &quot;hotwire&quot; from a 12v source (i.e. battery?) to the
positive side of the coil.  If it starts, or even if it sounds like it more
likely to start (like backfiring or attempting to start) you'll know to fix
this electrical problem first and then you can go on to troubleshoot some
more.

Good luck again....
