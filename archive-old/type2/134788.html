Subject: Re: [T2] Bay westie side tent poles

From: &quot;Jamie Auch&quot; &lt;jamie_at_kookymathteacher_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Did you say that you wre going to reproduce the  plastic tips of the
&gt; legs?  The ones that go into the ground.  I'll see if I can get a hook
&gt; for you.

Thanks, Jamie.  I didn't know about the tips.  If you could find one to go
along with the hook, that would be great.  I'd return both after making
mastering copies of them.
