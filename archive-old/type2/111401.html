Subject: Re: [T2] Help Idle Problems in TX...

i am going through the same thing at the momment...
i cant idle while stopped and trying to coast it cuts off on me and i just pop the clutch....
driving me crazy,.,..
mine is somehow in the idle circuit in the carb itself... it is still doing this after we (mechanic) rebuilt it twice,,...
straighten out for a bit but not long....
back to same ole thing...
check you accelerator cable also....
could be loose or slack...
what about the spring that is holding the throttle back...?
great big sucker .....,.,.,.,.,.,
check all hoses like jason said forvacum leaks...
that is very imprtant on how your engine is runnig exspecially at idle...
dont know what to tell you just wanted to throw some things out there..
good luck to you...
peace

hey jason bring me up on the sensor you are talking about?
could this be my problem also?
where do i look what am i looking for and most imprtantly do i have to look ? LOL
naw really not sure about that one .
thanks
