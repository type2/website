Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window vs. Splitty

&gt; When it comes to parts that you may need on a more regular basis going
&gt; forward (brake shoes, tune up parts, front end or suspension parts,
&gt; etc.), I think you'll find that the prices of splitty parts versus
&gt; bay-window parts are much closer to equal, on average. In fact, if
&gt; anything, this situation is gradually starting to turn toward the
&gt; advantage of the later busses. As fewer splitties are on the road, more
&gt; companies are discontinuing splitty parts. This has two results. First,
&gt; it reduces available quality. For example a Brazilian aftermarket part
&gt; may only be available for a splitty, while an OE part is still made for
&gt; the late bus. Secondly, it increases prices, because the aftermarket
&gt; part that remains available tends to go up in price as soon as the
&gt; competing part is discontinued (supply/demand). 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, as you have noted, the mechanical improvements versus the Splitty
&gt; are many. Many of these you cannot even put a price on, as they relate
&gt; to safety. The braking system is a perfect example, with most later
&gt; busses having disc brakes and all having a dual circuit master cylinder
&gt; (found only on the '67 splitty). These parts can be a bit more expensive
&gt; than on a splitty because they are different and far superior, so it's
&gt; not really an &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparison.  However, when you compare
&gt; those parts that are actually similar (i.e. brake drums, shoes, wheel
&gt; cylinders, hoses) the prices are about the same.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact brake master cylinder pricing is a good example of both of these
&gt; situatuons in action. The most common late bus master cylinder is $12
&gt; more than the most common splitty one, but is much more safe due to its
&gt; dual-circuit design - certainly worth the small price difference. On the
&gt; other hand, due to the supply/demand problem I alluded to, the
&gt; one-year-only dual-circuit splitty master cylinder that IS as safe as a
&gt; late bus one, is SIX TIMES its price - $180 versus $30.

Hello Guys           This is right to an extent , but some of the 
improvements aren't  better on the bays than the splits   I have up graded all my splits 
with the dual master clys. I have been using a standard beetle master cly cost 
new about $30.00 ( some will say that this cly is too small but they have 
been working great for me for about 10 years aand using either a resevior from a 
rabbit or volvo 240 the fill hole lines up perfectly) ,  also when was the 
last time you saw a split front axle rust away or worse break at the center pin 
like the bays do.  Have you ever seen a link pin break like the ball joints 
will.??  How about the trannys, the bays have problems with the ring and 
pinions,and the shifter selectors in the nosecones that doesn't occur in the splits,  
How about the motors  type 4 produces more power but has built in leaks, bad 
exhust design, valve seats that tend to come out, bad design at the pick-up 
tube, and a lot heavier and cost more to repair. The bottom end is very tough in 
the type 4 . I like them both but I do drive splitties and have been since 
1971     later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import Service  salem va
