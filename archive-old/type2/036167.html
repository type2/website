Which brings me back to the beginning. I was looking for the Noise Killer
page because I wanted to re-check some of the technical spec's and compare
it to the Delta Coat.

Here's my question.

When the time is right I am considering using both products, Noise Killer
and Delta Coat.

After looking at the products it seems that if you use both, the Noise
Killer should be applied first. It would probably be most effective when it
has direct contact with the metal. It apparently converts vibration to low
grade heat and would not work as well with something between it and the
vibrating metal.

The Delta Coat on the other hand is simply an insulating layer and would
perform just as well regardless of what's under it.

Seems like a great way to insulate for both sound and heat and not have to
consider the moisture/rust problem.

Any opinions? Do you think they would somehow effect each other and not work
as well? Noise Killer first or Delta first?

Just some thoughts,
