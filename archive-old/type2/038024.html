Subject: List Web Reflector

Folks,

Our web reflector at egroups_dot_com, which was unsatisfactory for a number of
reasons, has been replaced with a new interface running off our own server.
It's not as cutesy as egroups was, but it's fast as all git, and there are
no advertisements or logins or nag screens.

You get there through www.type2_dot_com by clicking the same buttons you used
to; or, you can go straight there:

type2 list: 	http://www.type2_dot_com/~type2reflect/maillist.html

vintagebus list: 	http://www.type2_dot_com/~splittyreflect/maillist.html

We are deliberately making the email addresses of posters unrecognizable
through the web so you won't be able to send pmail to the author of a
message you read there. This is not ideal, but it is best in these
spam-infested times--we will not allow anybody to harvest addresses and we
think the resulting inconvenience is acceptable. If you need to see the
email addresses of posters, you'll have to subscribe to the email list.

Please let me know if the new interface gives you any errors or if you have
any suggestions for improvement.
