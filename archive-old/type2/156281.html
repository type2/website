&gt; Does anyone know of a SPECIFIC pitman arm puller that actually works?  There

I use a pitman arm puller designed for a Chevy.  It's a little big, but I
made an adapter out of heavy angle to fill up the extra space.  Cost about
$15 bucks or so:

This works for pitman arms and ball joints (spindle side)
