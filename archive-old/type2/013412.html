&gt; I have a 1975 VW Westy camper. It has a pop top and the
&gt; interior is amazingly 
&gt; in darn good condition. The canvas top could be replaced.
&gt; The double beds are 
&gt; in 90% great shape along with the rest of the interior. I
&gt; have the sink to it 
&gt; but it is not installed. The engine has only three
&gt; cylinders left. I think 
&gt; the only thing wrong with the motor is one of the seats
&gt; fell off the head. I 
&gt; am getting it checked out on may 30th to be sure. All
&gt; heat/defroster and 
&gt; electrical systems are perfect. the original wood inside
&gt; and the cabinet is 
&gt; awesome condition.the original child hammok is in the bus
&gt; probably untouched. 
&gt;  has burbur carpet inside. the top (excluding the canvas)
&gt; is in awesome 
&gt; shape. it is an 1800 cc engine. it still runs but only on
&gt; 3 cylinders. I will 
&gt; probably get it fixed tomorrow. muffler could be
&gt; replaced...it is a solid 
&gt; California car that spent its life out there until last
&gt; month when I drove it 
&gt; to PA. It has no rust on it.it has brand new tires all
&gt; around and i got it 
&gt; alligned and everything. all the windows wind open, the
&gt; wipers work. i have 
&gt; all the original manuals too! i will tell you this. if
&gt; you gave Gulliver ( 
&gt; thats his name) a new paint job, a new canvas top, a new
&gt; muffler, he would be 
&gt; totally a looker! if i do those three things to him, i
&gt; will sell him for 
&gt; $3,500+ because I know I can get that for it. If i do not
&gt; fix him and sell 
&gt; him as is, probably with a good motoor though, i will
&gt; sell him for around 
&gt; 2500.If you are at all interested in giving Gulliver a
&gt; nice new home where he 
&gt; will be treated with the utmost respect, you can email me
&gt; at 
&gt; NAR311FAN_at_hotmail_dot_com    thanks    nicholas in PA
