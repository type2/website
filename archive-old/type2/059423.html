On the way to the Farmington swap meet/VW races, via 2 day campout
nearby...thanks to Brad Stiler for a great campout for about 35
busses!!...stopped near Boone NC to check out a $300 engineless and
&quot;gateless&quot; 1968 double cab owned 9 years ago by listee DocRic. Lots of rust,
smashed windshield, missing headlights, rotted tires etc, BUT, a pile of
extra parts..including a bug engine..anyone have a bus 1600 to
trade?...gates not only there after all, but in excellent condition, a
straight body and a primo interior. Happy that SO and I can now quit taking
all these mountain backroads to find our DC and that Dave Easterwood may
cease reneging on his promise to sell me his 62 model :)

Marv Krupp, 78 loaf/72 hightop camper/74 &quot;Westy&quot; camper/63 1500S...and now a
68 work truck! A KG next year..and that's it..we're gonna' have the fleet
neutered so as to limit the population.
