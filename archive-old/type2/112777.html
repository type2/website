Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

I hope you are NOT using this for body panels?? It is extremely aggressive
and will cut the metal as well as the rust, paint etc. In order to just
remove paint and rust, you would want to use either glass bead media,
(available in different sizes) or even less aggressive ground walnut shell
or plastic bead media. The black beauty or black silica is for industrial or
heavy metal use, such as on differential housings etc etc. NEVER use it on
panels it will warp them and remove metal as well, thinning them out.
HTH,
Courtney

 
admitting that I am a total amateur, but I use something
called &quot;Black Beauty&quot; which is pulverized slag as that
is what the professional sandblaster I begged advice from
said I should use
