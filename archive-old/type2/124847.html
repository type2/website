From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;Greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; ... I appreciate a nicely painted bus as much as the
&gt; next guy, but if I'd painted the westfakia at a &quot;Pro&quot; shop instead of
&gt; Maaco then I'd still be scouring the streets looking for bottles to
&gt; return to pay for it. (I bet a third of this list is too young to
&gt; remember returnable soda bottles. We haven't had them here in Ontario
&gt; since forever)...

Good grief!  I still remember hauling my wagon around collecting bottles for
spending money when I was a kid back in the 60's up in PA.  Here in Georgia
they still had them in the 80's, but eventually we caught up with everyone
else and they were phased out.

How about pop cans that you had to use a can opener on?  Steel cans, not
aluminum.  I still remember how marvelous a pop tab can seemed  back then
when they came out.

I understand Terry's (and other's) point about paint, but if I have to
choose between feeding and caring for my family and having my bus painted
professionally, I'm afraid that rattle cans start to look like a viable
alternative.

We were given the bus virtually for free, a real gift.  I recently had the
engine replaced and some other work done for around $2000.00.  That's my
entire bus budget for a long time to come.  I'm considering using rattle can
paint to touch up the rust spots on the bus after I clean them up and remove
the rust.

If I could take it to a paint shop, I would.  It just isn't an alternative
at this point in time.
