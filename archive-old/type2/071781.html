I remember &quot;Gasohol being available in limited areas of New Jersey in the late
70's early 80's. It was cheaper than Premium Unleaded which was universally 91
octane at that time, and was alleged to be closer to 93 octane. I had a 74
Datsun at the time and it ran great on the stuff. I don't know if it is still
available any where now. It was touted as our own renewable energy source, it
was made with corn squeezin's! ( I still have my bumper sticker with the corn
and the US flag on it)
