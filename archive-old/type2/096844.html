Subject: Re: turn signal cancellation

&gt;Almost forgot. My turn signals don't automatically cancel after making a =
&gt;turn any more. I have to manually shut them off. Can this be fixed, or do=
&gt; I need a new switch. (this wasn't working before I tried to fix the horn=
&gt;, but I figured I should take care of it while I have everything apart no=
&gt;w.)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Kyle

oooph. sounds as if its a late bay sprung a spring. pull the steering wheel
with the correct socket; look on the right side. one small tab? the other
broken or missing? you need two, plus the wacky spring for cancellation.

use the turn signal a few times while you're looking at it, see what moves.
then you'll see what i mean.  - steve
