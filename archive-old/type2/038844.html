Subject: 7/8&quot; Anti-Sway Bar Clamp

I have just installed the heavy duty 7/8&quot; Anti-Sway Bar on the front of my 77 
Bus and it's says to use the original clamps off the old sway bay. I have 
tried this and it doesn't seem like the clamps will ever fit, i have tried to 
get it to fit but to no avail. Has anyone else managed to pull this off? or 
do i need to get some bigger clamps, and if so where?
