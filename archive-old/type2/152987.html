Subject: Bus Identification

hi, Volks:

Saw what I think was a white Bay Sportsmobile today in Elkhart,
Indiana.  I saw it for about 3 seconds and saw it was:  a Bay, it was
white, it had a poptop that looked like a Sportsmobile poptop (aren't
they a little more square than a Westy?)  and had no luggage rack
above the headliner.   It looked like a runner, just parked at a
business parking lot.

Anyone on the list?
