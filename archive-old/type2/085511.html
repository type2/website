&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The folks at POR-15 claim that it is good for fiberglass repair/resto. I
&gt;&gt; understand that it needs to be topcoated... is there anyone who has used it
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; redo a poptop? If so would you use it again or go with gelcoat?
&gt; 
&gt; In New Bern, NC, there is a boatbuilder called Hatteras--named after the
&gt; home of man-eating sharks. They make seagoing yachts (the smallest boat in
&gt; their line is 50 feet long), and they paint all of them with urethane paint.
&gt; 
&gt; Your Bus's poptop deserves no less. You deserve no less.


Now this is great. Any recommendations on pre-treatment besides a good
cleaning?

Thanks

Tyler.
