Subject: Re: pictures and info of 73 westy

R. Dean Straight sends:

&gt; I am currently in the process of saving a 73 westy from the junkyard. It's
&gt; intact but I won't be able to get it until Aug 22 when the owner returns
&gt; from vacation. Would like to do a complete restore but to be honest can't
&gt; guarantee that it's a 73. Any help would be most appreciated.

Check the serial number on it--on Baywindow buses there's one stamped inside
the engine compartment where you can read it easily. The third digit on
1970s- era VWs is the model year--my 72 bus has &quot;232&quot; as its first three; my
74 Super has 134 as its first three.
