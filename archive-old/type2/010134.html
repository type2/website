All went very well with my &quot;test&quot; drive of the cruise control on my 75
westy. 2,000 miles was a bit much, but it all worked.

On a less positive note Late last week my friend Susi's sister died.
Thank you all for any help you gave. Susi is now on a drive between
North Carolina and southern Minnisota. If anyone sees her (With her dog
driving a silver Ch_at_vy s-10 pickup with North Carolina plates) give her
a smile and a wave.

Thanks again.
