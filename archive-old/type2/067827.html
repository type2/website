Waaaaay towards the back of the NOV 96 issue of National Geographic, the
folks at GTE have been nice enough to profile some surfer dude and his ride
- - a decently-maintained 70 hardtop camper. A bit stereotypical, perhaps,
but at least they didn't mock it. He needs to do something about that horn
wire, though!
