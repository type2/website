&gt; &gt;I would take tags from a validly registered vehicle in your name,  covers

&gt;
&gt; Um... with all due respect... are you guys nuts?  Putting a plate from one
&gt; car onto another and getting caught would at a minimum get you a nice fat
&gt; ticket, and may get you arrested.  I doubt your insurance company would be
&gt; amused, either (but hey, call and ask.  Just call anonymously!).

guess it's been a while since I did it but that is what my DMV told me to
do..

&gt; I think the $5 temporary plate is a good solution, that or mailing the
&gt; plates back (I don't think the previous owner can be held liable if he/she
&gt; has a signed bill of sale).

like always check the law where you are.
