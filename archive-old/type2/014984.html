	I would agree with the other response that was posted- check your fuel
filter first.  This clogging has the same symptoms you describe.  I spent a
trip halfway across the country like that one summer replacing fuel filters
as I went. Turned out that the metal fuel line between the tank and the
filter was corroded and clogging them up.  Replaced that with flexible line
and haven't had a problem since.
