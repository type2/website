Subject: [T2] OH, it's square.

I have run across a junkyard camper with a bay window and a square
mouthed tranny.  There is no engine.  It has been a mystery to me for a
while.  I can only guess some strange adaptation or ignorance on my part.
 I am considering pulling it out to use some of my old part to resurrect.
 Any input would be helpful.
