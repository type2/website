Subject: Vacation trip

Hello guys

This time is just for share with you all that I completed the first leg of 
my vatacion trip in my 1977 Westfalia stock 1600cc type 1 engine (european 
version), after evaluated the pros and cons of my wife car an the westy I 
decided to go in our 29 years old but reliable bus instead of my wife not 
too reliable and $30.000 2001 Renault Scenic, why, for the reason that 
despite the air condition, good handling and the posibility of cruise at 95 
miles/h of the Reanult, if something goes wrong whit it, the vacations will 
end too,  due to the lack posibilities of fix it on the road (imagine that 
you need to go to the dealer to check the level of the transmision oil) not 
to mention that the vacation budget has to be re schedule to the Renault 
dealer.
We were traveling trough the east region of my country (Venezuela) and we 
loged about 1500 miles with out any problems (cheers), since I had not 
meters in my bus I managed my self to atach the dewll/Tach to the top of the 
furniture so my son could read the RPM to had an idea of what happening with 
the engine, the roads where almost flat all the time so we were cruising at 
58 miles/h reading in the tach about 3400 rpm (those are good numbers?, 
somebody could tell me how much rpm are good to cruise with my type of 
engine) the outside temp was around 950 with a lot af side winds but the bus 
perform very well in legs of 4 to 5 hours of this conditions.What kind of 
previous mantinance I did before departure, oil change, verify dewll and 
timing and adjust drums brakes at the rear, thats all.
I am very happy and proud to own such of car and I am sure you are proud of 
yours too. In two days I will hit the road againg this time in a 500 miles 
leg, as soon as I come back I will let you know.

Greetings and keep on busing

Roberto
