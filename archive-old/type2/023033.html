Jim,

My humble opinion follows:  I'm not so sure that the electrical pump is 
less efficient.  Mechanical pumps are not 100% efficient either, and they 
work all the time regardless of whether they are needed.  Electric pumps 
could cycle on and off as needed.  There is also the issue of pump speed - 
the mechanical pump turns at the (variable) speed of the engine, and more 
speed generally takes more hp.  An electric pump turns at a constant speed 
of (what should be) maximum efficiency.  I think the savings can more than 
make up for the conversion losses.  I run a 25% underdrive water pump 
pulley on the Mustang and the manufacturer of the pulleys told me that 
underdriving the water pump produces the biggest gain of any other engine 
accessory.  My vote for the oil-water cooler goes to the electric pump.

So why don't water-cooled cars use electric pumps?  My guess is cost, and 
that they think it's not enough hp for the average consumer to worry about.
