Intermittent red light on
On the way home from High Country Bus fest, My generator light came on
brightly. Fan belt fine. Started up, three miles down the road, back on.
Stayed off after restart, but I was only 2 miles from home. Any ideas?
Voltage regulator?All connections look fine, and was a very bright light.

High Country Bus fest was GREAT. Hats off the Mike Myers and my buds from
the Full Moon Bus Club.
