Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Paint Jobs and Prices

OK, OK.. I admit that I don't know much about paint, but I raise my eyebrows
at $3,000 too!
The best advice that I have heard is to do all the prep yourself and take
the bus to Earl Scheib, Maaco, One Day or whatever budget painting place you
can find and go for it. Most of the quality and labor and cost is in the
prep process, anyway. Prep is going to have FAR more effect on the final
product than anything else, from what I've heard. It's also the only part
that almost anyone can do themselves well, without a lot of equipment and
spray booths, if they're willing to take the time to do it right. It's hard
work, but it's also where you can save the most money.
