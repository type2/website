Subject: Fw: Motor Changes For the Bus 

 Jack,
 I have seen a flat 6 porche motor in a highly modified bus in the local
 area. I don't know any details, but when I have seen it, it goes REALLY
 well. They also did the right thing by upgrading the suspension and brakes
 to match the HP of the motor, it sits very low to the ground. I don't know
 what Trans they used though.
 Richard,
 Brisbane Australia
 '77 bus (Andy)
