Subject: RE: [T2] seats question

Rob,

The rear most seat for a '79 is the folding rear back. I think it had
brackets to detach and fold the back down and maybe even a longer rear
carpet that covered the back of the seat. I think that they also had head
rests. I know the middle seats did. This should be '74-'79 era. The earlier
ones would probable work with some modifications of back rest brackets. The
floor mounting is the same in all years. Hope this helps.

Subject: [T2] seats question



I'm about to go hunting through the local boneyards for middle and rear
seats
for my '79 bus, and may even scout for front seats as well.  Can anyone
tell me what years of bus/vanagon seats will fit?  The rear seat is
mainly
what I'm looking for, as the PO removed the seat long ago and built
a shelf for tools, leaving the rear seat to rust to death in his yard.
The middle
seat is in OK condition, but if I find a better one or a matching set
I'll get them both.

Also, while I'm at it, I may look for better front seats.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rob
