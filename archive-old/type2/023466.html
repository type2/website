After 6 months of intense study and searching, I found a 1970 westy. That has 
102,000 miles on it , with a rebuilt [ by an excellent local machine shop] 
motor at 85,000.  The  Original PO  kept it  garaged for 29 years  when he 
was not  driving it. The camper interior has everything original including 
the curtains that are not faded. The window rubber is original and in 
excellent condition and the exterior paint looks 5 years old. I feel I was 
quite  fortunate to find this , and by studying thru the Type2 website, I was 
able to educate myself enough to know what  to look for. So thanks all for 
the help. Now one of the things that intrigues me about this Westy  is that 
it has painted hubcaps. The PO told me it came that way, but all I have ever 
seen are chrome hubcaps. Whats up with that,anybody know.
