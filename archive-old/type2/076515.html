Woohoo!  This is the bus that this list created - *I* rebuilt the engine,=

input from this group.

I'm trying to move some parts to offset the cost of purchase. I'm in a he=
ll of
a spot right now as far as cash goes...
If anybody needs any of this stuff, let me know. Motivated seller!

Full set of beltline trim for 68-71 - $50 OBO
Two complete axles from a 71 bus-original 88k miles-good boots-You should=
 have
a spare set- $50 OBO

Other parts - i have three parts busses - 78, 76 and 71 and a pile of typ=
e4
parts...ask me - i may still have it!

BTW - has anyone ever shipped a rear hatch door? the big one, i mean...

Thanks,

Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
