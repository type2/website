Brazing versus Welding versus Soldering.

&gt; So I'm looking through an industrial supply catalog and I come across a
&gt; little propane-oxygen torch setup. It says this thing burns at 4600
&gt; degrees, and it says it can braise, weld or cut. I don't even know what
&gt; braising is.

Brazing - A process similar to soldering.  
Solder low melting point stuff to attach higher melting point stuff.  
Braze uses higher melting point alloys, usually copper base, with 
other stuff in there.  Comes close to the melting point of the parent 
material, wheras welding melts the parent material.  
Brazing is a excellent process for joining different materials together.  
Parts that have a slightly different color at the joint between pieces 
usually have been brazed.  One can successfully braze cast materials 
that cannot be welded.  Carbide tips on grinding tools are brazed onto 
the shaft, look for the small band of brassy color.

&gt; Could this possibly weld body panels? I'm not looking for show-quality
&gt; stuff, just rust repair that will hold up. The gas setup is a LOT cheaper
&gt; than a real welder.

Using a gas welder on sheetmetal is usually not a successful process.  
You want very localized very hot temerature to melt base metal and rod. 
To get the weld area hot enough to actually weld, the adjacent areas 
get too hot and start to warp.  The gas pressure and flow tends to blast 
the melted material out of the joint.  It can be done, but it takes a fine 
practiced hand to keep the melt puddle large enough to weld without 
getting so large that gravity steps in and fills your shoes with hot metal.
