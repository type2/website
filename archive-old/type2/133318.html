Subject: Re: [T2] Needed Relay (used)

&gt; If anyone has one stashed, I could *really* use a used double relay, part #
&gt; 133 919 431.  It fits various models of mid-late 70's VW 1600s, and is
&gt; mounted to the bottom of the fuse box.
&gt;
&gt; BD has them _at_ $125, and the dealer has them for significantly more, but
&gt; frankly I don't have that much moolah at the moment.  If anyone has a lead,
&gt; or is willing to yank one from a boneyard, please contact me pmail.

the double relay is ONLY used on a fuel injected engine, and is mounted in
the engine compartment, the relay you need is probably the hi beam relay
and they can be had fairly inexpensively.
