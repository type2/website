&gt; Also has anybody else thought or gone through with installing the heater
&gt; somewhere else besides the engine compartment? I was thinking maybe
&gt; under the z-bed. 
Hmm,

Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much less
burning it there.  You are on your own, but from a safety standpoint i
dont think i'd ever consider putting a gas heater inside the bus. What if
it springs a leak in the middle of the night, you want it separated from
yoru sleeping loved ones (or if you are single &amp; love yourself, loved
one) by 1 foot of airspace or a firewall?

Yeah, I know some old splitties had one inder the dash inside the bus 3
inches from the passengers Knee, but ask me if I am looking for one...

take care,

Steve
