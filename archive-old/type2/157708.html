Kenneth Hooper askz:
&gt;&gt; I wonder if there's a difference in insulating for
reflected noise (like in a concert hall) and insulating for transmitted noise
(like in a vehicle).

&quot;Insulating for   reflected noise&quot; is actually sound
ABSORPTION, not really &quot;insulation&quot;. Applies in concert halls *and* buses.
&quot;insulating for transmitted noise&quot; is sound INSULATION, or sound ISOLATION.
(Uppercase letters just for emphasis - I'm not yelling at you ;-)

Sound
absorption &quot;soaks up&quot; the noise in any given space - e.g the noise that's
created in the engine compartment, or any noise that finds its way into the
passenger space - so
 adding soft, porous absorbers in these spaces will help.
Adding absorption in the passenger space might also help to increase your
perception of &quot;quality&quot; of the vehicle, since it will be not only less noisy,
but also less reverberant or &quot;echoey&quot; inside.

Sound isolation &quot;contains&quot; the
noise - for example, keeping it in the engine bay, instead of letting it leak
thru' the divider into the passenger space. Adding mass to the divider helps
increase sound isolation - hence your experience with the sheet lead in marine
diesel installations. (The pink construction foam is to separate the 2 sheets,
because at certain frequencies, 2 separated sheets are better than a single,
thicker (e.g. for walls, studs &amp; drywall can work better than just the
drywall) - but we're probably getting too complex for bus applications.
Vibration damping reduces the amount of &quot;ringing&quot; that occurs in body panels.
This is achieved by the tar-like stuff that bends with the panel but has
 some
&quot;viscosity&quot;, thus converting vibration energy to heat. This stuff also has
some mass, however, so improves sound isolation a little, too.
rodewarrior_at_comcast_dot_net clarifies:
&gt;&gt; The bubble wrap [..] as insulation, not
done for acoustic treatment

Sorry - my misunderstanding!
