&gt;I tried looking through the archives, but couldn't find the exact answers I
&gt;was looking for...  Is it worth getting hydraulic lifters, and have you had
&gt;any problems with them?  I'm considering getting a longblock (with
&gt;hydraulic lifters if it's worth getting them) from Mofoco. Also, is Mofoco
&gt;a good place to buy from, or is there a better company?

I put in hydraulic lifters and it has been great for 54,000 miles so far.
And I haven't ever adjusted the valves during that time, despite the
assertions by many that I should be doing so.  I say go for it!
