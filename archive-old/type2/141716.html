Subject: Re: [T2] An interesting electrical phenomenon...

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;John Baker&quot;

&gt; wire #1, red terminal on gun connected to battery
&gt; power, black terminal on gun to ground. When I squeeze
&gt; the timing gun trigger to make the light strobe, the
&gt; engine begins to cut out.

When you say battery power,, does that mean on the battery + terminal,, or 
on the power wire somewhere else,, like the coil power terminal?

I think your timing light has a short, and draws the avail power on that 
circuit low enough to effect the operation of the ignition circuit..

just a guess...

you can put a 12v lamp in series with the timing light..[or use an amp 
meter] to see what the timing light is drawing for power.

If you use a 12v lamp,, and it is in series .. then the lamp should light 
dim,, or half bright,, but not full bright.  IF the lamp goes to full 
bright,,there is a short in the timing light...

hope that helps
