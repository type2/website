Subject: value of '77 Riviera?

Hi folks. I'm new to the list and don't quite have a VW bus yet. Here's why:

I've agreed to buy a '77 Riviera from the soon-to-be PO. My credit union has
approved the loan but needs a &quot;book value&quot; on the bus before they can finish
the paperwork. Most of the used-car books only go back to 1979; same with
the Internet resources I've checked. The CU says they've even called other
financial institutions without any luck.

Does anyone have any suggestions I can pass along to the loan officer? The
bus is in pretty good shape (for a '77) with 103K on the odometer and a new
engine installed last summer.

(This'll be my first bus but not my first VW; I had a '71 Beetle about 12
years ago.)

Thanks and best regards,

Brian Baresch

'77 Riviera soon, I hope
