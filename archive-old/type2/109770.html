&gt; Uh, you're aware, I hope, that the wire supplying power to the 
&gt; coil is a 1.5mm wire which goes through the ignition switch.  I 
&gt; would be very careful about drawing any additional power from it.  
&gt; A relay for additional loads would be the best bet.

   Thanks for that reminder David.
    The little yellow fuse dangling by the coil is the 3 Amp fuse I was 
referring to in
    my last post. It is inline with the ignition wire and 
    serves to protect most of the circuits activated by the ignition switch.
    A good, inexpensive safety measure for even a standard setup.
