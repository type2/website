Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA selfish/stupid/paranoid... sales thought vs legal thought

Gentlepersons-
                       Not to be too negative. but I strongly suspect that VW 
is only inter-
ested in selling new VW's. Proof positive; quick poll, how many aircooled 
owners have
had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with service/parts?
