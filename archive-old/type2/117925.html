Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

&gt;Or, you could get yourself an electronic ignition, since the stock ignition 
&gt;is the weakest link in our mechanicals, and run whatever the Hell plug you 
&gt;want.  8 years and counting without a glitch with my Crane.

If someone looks in the archives I have posted a simular comment.
Friends have had fouled plugs. misfires, etc.
I put a Pertronix in my bus years ago. I ran platinum plugs
that I put in and ignored for years. No problem.
