Subject: [T2] bilge blower speed control - HOW?

Okay - got a couple general electricity questions. My application is a 78 
VW Westy (aircooled) but figured it's general car question basically.

Bought two Atwood 3&quot; bilge blowers today. $17.36 each if you're curious. 
Plan on replacing my single cneter mounted VW aux blower (over the engine) 
with these guys.

Going to have to work out two small details - a flapper to control backflow 
through the blowers when not in use (the VW version has a flapper on each 
side) and speed control.

These little guys put out 145 cfm each so I doubt I'll need to run them at 
full blast very often. Of course since they are going to be set up with one 
providing thrust for only one side - I'll have to run both with I need the 
heat/blowers.

How do I construct a variable speed control for these? I need the 
equivalent of a ceiling fan speed control. Hmmm - would that work?

I don't want to put them down stream of the heaters because they won't last 
like I want them to - the box says don't subject them to more than 160 
degrees continuously. I figure I'll risk hanging them in the engine 
compartment and see what happens.

That also rules them out as inline blowers... &lt;grin&gt; I have concerns with 
creating a situation where I could suck in exhaust fumes through seams in 
the exhaust system since instead of adding positive pressure, I would be 
adding negative pressure (basically).

What do you think?

Thanks everybody...
