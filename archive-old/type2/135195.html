Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper question

&gt; BD has a primered bumper for $80. Chrome for $120. WW has
&gt; primered for $125, with no chrome listed.
&gt;
&gt; Since it's obvious that I'll be getting it from BD (even with
&gt; shipping it's cheaper than WW where I can go pick it up),
&gt; anybody have any comments on the chrome one? Quality? I like
&gt; the idea of not having to paint it after I get it. And chrome
&gt; is just so.... BLING!
&gt;
&gt; The BD picture sucks, but it appears to have a rubber
&gt; molding. Is this correct?


All of the replacement bumpers (whether primered or chrome) come from
Wolf/Brazil, no matter where you buy them. The gauge of metal is decent;
they're reasonably heavy and I've yet to see one rust out. The primered ones
will probably last you longer than the chrome ones, only because they can
easily be refinished. That is, if you do get a spot of surface rust you can
simply sand and repaint it (something which is hard to do with a chrome
finish). But the chrome ones (assuming you get the better ones; see below)
still hold up reasonably well, and they do look great. I put them on my '77
Westy and did not regret it.

As for the chrome bumpers, Wolf makes two quality levels, standard and &quot;show
chrome.&quot;  I'd call the chrome quality on their &quot;show chrome&quot; ones decent but
not exceptional, and the quality of their standard chrome ones unacceptable.
Their &quot;show chrome&quot; ones are claimed to be triple-plated, and although they
still rust out sooner than the originals did (if you can even find an
original chrome bumper), they're pretty decent. A good value for the money,
in my opinion. I had them on my '77 Westy for about two years before I sold
it, and in that much time they still looked great. You can extend the life
of the chrome finish by waxing the bumper regularly.

By comparison, the chrome finish on Wolf's standard chrome ones starts to
pit as soon as you install the bumper. I won't sell them; my standard ones
are what Wolf calls the &quot;show chome&quot; ones. But other vendors do sell the
standard ones (typically for the same price I charge for the show chrome
ones), so beware if you buy elsewhere.  You cannot tell from the packaging
which is which, so also beware if buying at swap meets, etc.

To answer your other question, what may appear to be a rubber molding in the
picture is simply a protective plastic strip that can be peeled off.  If
anyone has a closeup of these bumpers on their bus and wouldn't mind my
using it on my website, I'd love a better picture. (The same applies to any
other Bus Depot part that you've put on your van; I'm always looking for
good pics of my parts in use!)
