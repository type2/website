Subject: 73-79 New bumper Quality?

Hello list,

I currently have a 78 westy shell in the paint shop and am seeking new 
bumpers, or at least a set that is straight and free from rust. I want my 
body guy to paint them up for me. They will be painted the stock 
white(L90D).

I was wondering how the new primered bumpers offered by several of our 
vendors compare to the original thing?

How do they differ if at all?

Or does anybody have either a front and/or rear bumper in excellent shape 
that they would be willing to sale/trade and ship to Utah? Or any other 
ideas?

Thanks,
Brandt
