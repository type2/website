Subject: Re: [T2] bus door seals

I'm not sure since mine is a 79, but I also have this channel on the
body of the bus. It is used for the vinyl covering that covers the
seat pilars. It gives it a place to terminate in &amp; gives a nice
looking finish (for those who actually have it in good condition)
