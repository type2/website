It's really difficult in our culture to do anything that involves  
much money, much less that's as visible a consumer choice as a  
vehicle, without having a really simple sort of label or niche for  
it. That's why there are so many SUVs on the road today -- that has  
been the easiest choice for the past 10 years or so. All you have to  
do is say &quot;I need the room&quot; or &quot;it's safer&quot; (whether the latter is  
true or not).

So too, for some people, is having at &quot;ratt&quot; vehicle, whether it's a  
bus, or (more likely) a Toyota pick-up in gray primer with a light  
bar on the roof. It says &quot;I don't care what you think,&quot; and everybody  
understands.

Having a nice bus, one that's straight and has good paint. is easiest  
to explain by pointing to that auction in Scottsdale and calling the  
bus an investment.

What isn't easy is restoring a bus (or any older vehicle) and then  
using it as a daily driver. I think that the exchange between Tony  
and Dan really nailed it. You can have a very nice, dependable bus  
for about $10,000. That seems like an &quot;investment,&quot; and yet millions  
of people spend twice, three times that for a car they'll have only  
four to eight years.

What you need in order to use a restored bus for a daily driver is an  
explanation that doesn't get anyone's nose out of joint, and that you  
can get through in the time it takes your neighbor to walk out to the  
mailbox and back.
