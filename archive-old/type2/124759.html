Subject: RE: [T2] Listmember discount at BD

&gt; Asked: &quot;what the code or whatever is to get the listee 
&gt; discount at Bus Depot?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Response:  I know, I know...  Isn't it frustrating that the 
&gt; discount code isn't something SIMPLE, like  . .    type2   ...???
&gt; 
&gt; Ron, haven't you gotten the hint yet????  NOBODY remembers 
&gt; the code, make it SIMPLE!!


It can't be quite that simple, or bus owners who are not list members,
and not entitled to the discount, might simply guess it (as they
certainly would &quot;type2&quot;). In fact, although I've been remiss in doing
it, I'd planned to change it periodically so that only current list
members would know the current code. Because it really is just for list
members.

But it's not that hard to remember. If you can remember the word &quot;list&quot;
(as in &quot;list member&quot;) there are only two characters besides that.  If
you forget it, just email me (or the list).


It is  list1e .
