Subject: Re: [T2] Waterproofing sunbrella poptop?

&lt;&lt;[T2] Waterproofing sunbrella poptop? 
With the sunbrella poptop canvas replacement do you need to waterproof
it if you are going to camp in the rain with the top open? And if so
with what? GoWesty sells some spray and I have read that others use
scotch guard what is best if any?&gt;&gt;

The beauty of Subrella is it doesn't need any water proofing---

It's comes witha 5 year guarantee not to rot, or leak.

It breaths like cotton canvas but it won't sun rot, or fade, nor leak.

It won't be exposed to the sun all the time, as a boats canvas would be
so expect a long, happy, relationship with your Sunbrella pop top canvas
without adding any waterproofing, for a long , long time.

It's the best you could possibly do for a Westfalia canvas.


Adios,
