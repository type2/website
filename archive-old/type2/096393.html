Subject: Re: [T2] top end rebuild and compression

Well, I did rehone the cylinders, but am not sure this was done
sufficiently.  My father-in-law brought over his honing tool that he uses
for his tractors.  The stones on the tool seemed a bit worn, but I was
told that they were OK.  We hooked the tool up to a drill and ran it
for a minute or so on each cylinder.  It did make a spiral pattern on the
inside of the barrel, but the marks were not as distinct as the original
honing marks (which could still be seen).  Is this OK?

I did in fact measure the p/c clearance using a micrometer and the Bentley
method.  I think it was about a .006&quot; gap, which was within spec.  Also,
although I did clean the pistons using the &quot;broken ring&quot; method, I tried
to do this as little as possible (having read warnings against it).  For
the most part, I let Simple Green and time do most of my work.

I guess I'll just have to recheck compression in a few k miles...

&gt;
&gt; Compression on a new motor could be low. Before the rings and cylinders
&gt; wear in you will have low compression. After break in procedure the
&gt; compression will then be much better, or should. New rings on worn
&gt; cylinders will never wear in.
