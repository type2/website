&gt; I have a very early '68 bus, and am looking for the wiring
&gt; diagram for it.

Could you provide chassis number for confirmation?  Shipping code
from bulkhead tag might be helpful.  If the first digit is not
'U' it wasn't shipped to US.  M-Code options from that tag may
indicated manufacture for shipment to another country as well.

&gt; Don't say Bentley!!  the diagram in Bentley is wrong for my bus -
&gt; mine doesn't have either parking lights or reverse lights - but
&gt; does have 2 bulbs at the rear - one for indicators, 1 for
&gt; stop/tail...

It may be that you have a non-US version.  I had problems finding
the right diagram for my late '67 for a long time.  When I
finally got a hold of the VW Workshop Manual, it made sense.
Even narrowing it to '67 (from 217.000.000, August 1966) didn't
cover everything because the non-US versions have different
configurations.  Also the M-Codes may hold the key.  Exports to
France and Austria have different electrical configurations, but
I'm not sure of a layout that would eliminate parking and reverse
lights.  The 2-bulb rear is a non-US layout (at least it was in
'67).  Is the rear lens a two-part amber/red?

&gt; I am having on-going problems with the lights, and really _NEED_
&gt; a wiring diagram...

You might try referencing the '67 non-US wiring diagram on Thom
Fitzgerald's website.  The diagrams are in color and he is
currently re-scanning for better resolution but there may be
something useful.  I found that some of my '67 US stuff was
closer to '68 US stuff than the earlier diagrams.
