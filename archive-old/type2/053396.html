Subject: Tossing alternator belt (type 4 engine)

Our '72 Bus has been tossing the alternator belt for the last
week or so.  The first time it happened, it was an old belt
so I put on a new one.  Now, over the past 2 weeks (of limited
driving) it's slipped off 3-4 times.  There don't appear to be any 
damage to the pulleys.  Is it most likely an alignment problem
or is there something else (gremlins??) I need to look at?

Thanks
Dave
