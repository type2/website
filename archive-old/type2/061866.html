Subject: Re:Water Tanks

I'd think that plain old whiskey or vodka would stop the pump and water
tank from freezing, and would probably taste better to many people than
anti-freeze or windshield de-icer.  Whiskey/vodka is about 50% ethyl
alcohol, and can be consumed in small amounts without lethal effect if you
avoid risky tasks until it is out of your system.
