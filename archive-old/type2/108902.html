Subject: RE: [T2] Front License Plate

Laura,

Almost all late model buses that I have seen in Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, and California had their plates bolted onto their front
bumpers with the two bolts provided.  Although I have seen a few
westies with the front license plate mounted into the interior of
the spare tire which they mounted on the front.  Maybe there is
somebody with a plate holder, but I think that most buses just used
the bolts in the center of the bumper.  I am of the sentiment that a
plate holder would look much cleaner.  I have never much liked
mounting my front plate to my front bumper, because the plate tends
to hang lower than the bumper and occassionally will scrape when
pulling into a steep driveway from a level street.  Kinda hard on
the license plate.

&gt; I got a ticket the other day for not having a front
&gt; license plate on my bus.
&gt; I hadn't ever really noticed it was missing. What type of
&gt; plate holder
&gt; &quot;officially&quot; went on a 1979 Westfali?a.
&gt;
&gt; Also, what parts of the wing window does one have to
&gt; replace when the little
&gt; black knob falls off?
&gt;                                    Laura :o)
