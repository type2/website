Hi Volks!

I agree about not braking suddenly, BUT: if things get really
hairy, you'll be better of braking with the brakes than with
the engine.  The brakes act on all four wheels, the engine on
just two (normally).  This can and does leave people spinning,
especially so with a rear-engined vehicle like an old VW.
Been there, done that, seen others do it too.

&gt; My Golf with 5-speed transmission is a pretty good snow car. 

Yup, mine too (even anti-lock brakes!).  But I'm very much
looking forward to my first Bus winter in my soon-to-be-bought
'74 Kombi... I only hope its heater is good.

&gt; I have fond memories of my '65
&gt; Beetle aka &quot;The Winter Assault Vehicle&quot; 

*lol*  Yeah.  Mine was a '70.  I only got stuck once, on what
I'll for the moment call a road that normally was for tanks
only.  Hey, the signs were full of snow, and with the foot or
so of snow on it, it *looked* like an Autobahn.  It *felt*
like a field, though.  :-)

&gt; With the wheels
&gt; spinning, I got out of the car and pushed myself out. Then quickly hopped
&gt; back into the Bug.

Tried that with my Audi 80 once, only to fall on my face while
pursuing it and have it end its short journey in a tree.
No damage, just more digging.  Definitely not recommended --
kids, don't try this at home!

Sorry about the lack of bus content -- hey, it could all have
been in a bus for all the difference it would make.  See it
as advice from North Germany, where winters have been short 
but serious lately.  We're still waiting for this season's
month of winter ;-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
