Eddie,

Check the FI Troubleshooting Manual (available online through the Library).
It has a decent wiring diagram that includes the double relay.

I also think that the Bentley manuals have decent enough wiring diagrams for
the job.

Both have been helpful recently.

&gt; Hi everyone...
&gt;
&gt; My struggle with this fuel pump continues....
&gt; I am sitting here with the relay and wiring diagram in front of me, but
&gt; for some reason I can't get this to work. I know the relay and pump
&gt; are in working order. Could someone please tell me how
&gt; to wire the FI fuel pump from the double relay. There are 6 terminals
&gt; involved on the relay. (86a,88y,85,88z,86c,88d) Where are they supposed to
&gt; go? I'm missing the harness that was designed for this. Are they
&gt; available anywhere? Or is there an easier way to do this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt; Eddie
