&gt; I do use on grades, but the tranny will upshift anyway if you overspeed.

Hey Bob,

Are you sure about the upshift thing? Mine has NEVER done this. Being that
mine is an Air-Cooled_Auto_Vanagon_Westy, I feel like I have some
familiarity with manipulating the gears for the best possible management of
the underwhelming power available. I use first up to 30MPH (which I feel is
probably decadent) and second up to 50 or even 55 if I am up against some
performance machinery.

I do the same things as you on downhill grades, (but I repeat) I have never
experienced an upshift to a higher gear than the one I have selected with
the lever. 1-2 when in 2 but never 2-3 in 2.

Should I be winding it out more?
