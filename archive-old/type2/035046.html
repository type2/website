&gt; injection. Two months and $1000 later I got it back, but it ran like sh*t.   I then took it to 

personal comment, you got ripped off

&gt; It seems no matter how much money or time I put into this thing, I can't keep it going.   It 
&gt; has always seemed terribly underpowered also, even with a fresh rebuild.  The old lady says 

all VW's are underpowered, the 2L fuel injected engine when properly tuned
is about as peppy as was ever put into any aircooled VW

&gt; Here are some of my questions:
&gt; 	How many miles should I expect from a 2L Type IV?

100,000+  

&gt; 	Could I retrofit a Vanagon engine in my Type 2?

an early Vanagon  80-83

&gt; 	Would the Vanagon engine be an improvement?

probably not much

&gt; 	How about installing an american V6 (or similar)?

you got your work cut out for you, it has been done, sometimes reasonably
succesfully, but if you can't maintain it 100% yourself you are asking for
a money pit

&gt; 	Can I get an engine that can maintain the speed limit going uphill?

how steep a hill,  a 2L fuel injected engine should be able to maintain
the speed limit on most interstate roads, maybe falling off a little in
the mountains,  secondary roads which are steeper can cause a speed drop
off, but you should be able to maintain 50 on just about anything short of
a very steep hill.

&gt; 	How reliable is the Vanagon compared to a Type 2?

about the same

&gt; 	What is going to be the most cost effective solution?

get the fuel injection back on the bus, and learn to maintain it yourself.

or get big monthly payments on a new car. (but then you won't have the
money to go anywhere)

&gt; I don't have a lot of money to sink into this thing.  I've already spent over $4,000 and it still 
&gt; doesn't run.   Maintenance and break-downs are killing me.  I love the VW camper style, but 
&gt; it doesn't do me any good if it won't go anywhere.

know how you feel, if you do the maintenance yoursely it will probably be
less costly than car payments, if you aren't consider learning.  paying
someone else to work on a 20+ year old car is rarely cost effective

just my nickel
