The heads must be taken off in order to get the old tubes out and put the new
ones in. As far as sealant, all I used and was recommended to use, was the new
gaskets that come in your basic engine gasket kit. Of course I'm working on a
'65 not a '80 but the heads should still need to come off. Otherwise how are you
going to get the push rod tubes out from around the push rods? Happy wrenching!

 Hey everybody!! 

 I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil 
stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could 
any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through 
the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them? What 
sealant should I use? 



Thanks,
R&amp;R GREAKER 
80 Westy
