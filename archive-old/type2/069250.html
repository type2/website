Subject: '61 Double Cab for Sale

A friend of mine is selling his '61 double cab (actually it might be
a '60)

Since he recently married into a 2-child family, and now has a &quot;normal&quot;
car, he's selling the bus.

Bad parts:
cut wheel wells
wrong taillights
some funky repair work on the windshield frame: you can't see the seam
at the bottom of the window between the nose and winshield.

Might be bad, might be good:
IRS conversion

Good:
nice 1600 DP motor
good trans
really clean bus throughout
guages installed in fresh-air box (tach, oil temp, pressure)
straight body, almost perfect, if not actually perfect, gates
nice interior

I don't know if the stereo goes with it.

$6k (I know, wow!)
