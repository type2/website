Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper Juice Tube Attachment, Day 2.

I haven't actually used one, but i think
a small nylon tie-wrap would do nicely.

Subject: [T2] Wiper Juice Tube Attachment, Day 2.
&gt; Question:
&gt; What can be used to attach the wiper juice tube to the small plastic
&gt; piece inside the steering column?  (ie: small metal attachment, wire
&gt; wrapped around, or something - as long as it fits inside when I close
&gt; the casing)
