&gt; 
&gt;  Greetings, Bus Folks,
&gt;  
&gt;  My 74 Bus developed some erratic braking, sometimes pulling to the right
&gt;  and sometimes locking up one of the right wheels (RF, I think). I knew the
&gt;  rear adjusters were frozen up (had attempted to adjust them recently) so I
&gt;  decided to do a brake job, starting at the rear. I found the RH brake
&gt;  covered with brake fluid, and the adjusting screws were beyond saving, and
&gt;  the LH had brake fluid under the cups, so I replaced the shoes, wheel
&gt;  cylinders, and RH adjusters (lubing both sets of adjusters with white
&gt;  grease), adjusted and bled the rear.
&gt;  
&gt;  Now for my problem. After bleeding the rear until I got no air from the
&gt;  bleeders, I still have way too much pedal travel, and the brakes will pump
&gt;  up. OK, gotta be air in the lines, so we bleed 'em again. No bubbles in the
&gt;  bottle, no improvement. Decided to bleed the front, no bubbles, no
&gt;  improvement. So I start thinking, disc brake cars have an equalizer
&gt;  (sometimes called proportioning) valve that might have to be centered (some
&gt;  have springs and are self-centering). I found the brake pressure regulator,
&gt;  but lack of time and an abundance of frustration caused me to call it a
&gt;  day. After getting clean, dry and warm, I found the Bentley manual has a
&gt;  procedure to check pressures, and says the BPR can't be repaired. Does
&gt;  anyone know, is the BPR self-centering (springs on both sides of the
&gt;  valve)? 
&gt;  
&gt;  I searched the archives and found no reference to the brake pressure
&gt;  regulator. I did find a post with similar symptoms to what I started with
&gt;  (pulling, locking up). Jon Kirshbaum, are you out there?
&gt;  
&gt;  Any help / advice / experience is greatly appreciated.

Hi Ray,

Now I cann't claim to be a brake expert - but the following may be helpful.

With a 74 there will be a pressure regulator between pressure cylinder and the
rear brakes. SOME of these have a bleed valve on the top of them so if you
have one bleed there before the back wheels.

Also the way the regulator works is by a ball bearing sliding forward when the
rear end of the bus lifts so if you are parked facing down a hill the
regulator could be already cutting off the flow to the rear wheels. so bleed
the rear brakes on the flat or facing up hill.

Good luck
Bob
