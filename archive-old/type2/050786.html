Subject: [T2] Broken rear hinge on Poptop

My Westy came with one of the rear hinges broken. The scissors part of the
hinge has the pivot point where they are joined broken. (Like the screw that
holds the two scissors blades together on scissors). Is this a replaceable
part? Any help on how to do this? Please contact me off list.
Many thanks,
Courtney Hook
