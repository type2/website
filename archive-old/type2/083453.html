Subject: fyi: eurovan buyers' market?

According to the Wall Street Journal, minivan's in
general are in low demand, so deals abound on even
hondas and Toyotas.

A friend of mine bought a brand new Eurovan  (traded a
four-year-old one in) last week. He got a bed and
table, but no pop-top.
He said it was stickered at about $30,000 and the
dealer came down to $24K and some change without any
prodding.
