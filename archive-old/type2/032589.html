Hi all:

Thanks to everyone who wrote to advise me concerning lack of fuel in my
fuel line. I installed a used fuel pump and now have gas circulating
through the lines. Given that the bus had sat through six years of
inactivity with fuel sitting in the pump, I suspect that the pump had
just become gummed-up beyond recovery.

I still haven't been able to start the engine. After installation of the
new pump, the engine turns over, and fires five or so times, but that's
it. Could this be a symptom of clogged injectors? I'd appreciate any
ideas.

Thanks and Happy New Year.

Rob Mead
