I'm a registered locksmith specializing in VW.  If you can't find them 
locally, I have the generic &quot;hardware store&quot; type keys, a black rubber 
headed key, and the duplicate of original with the VW logo.  There was a 
suggestion about RMMW for the originals.  Be aware that these are steel, not 
brass, and very few places can cut them.  It takes a special cutter on a 
fairly hefty machine to make a key on a brass blank.  I can offer that 
service, along with code cutting.  There is a discount for members of this 
list, along with the vintage and Vanagon lists.  Please feel free to contact 
me with any other questions.
