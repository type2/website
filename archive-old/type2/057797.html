&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; I anyone on the list going to Burning Man next weekend in Nevada next
&gt;&gt; weekend?
&gt;&gt; http://www.burningman_dot_com
&gt;&gt; I remember seeing somewhere that someone was
&gt;&gt; organizing a &quot;spiral of VW buses&quot;!!
&gt;
&gt;It sounds like fun, but the concept of paying a promoter $100 (!) to
&gt;park on a dry lake in the Black Rock Desert is a bit too far out.  I
&gt;guess I'm just too mundane to get into the Burning Man spirit!

Does sound like fun; I was hoping to be able to go this year but won't quite
make it. (BM is one reason I got my bus!) Next year fasure.

Looking forward to some good trip reports,
