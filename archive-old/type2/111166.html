Subject: customer service 

Hello List,

I do most of my VW Bus shopping at Busdepot (which I
love) and on Eb_at_y, but when I looked around for a
online source for Brake Booster hose, I was told Bus
Boys sells it.  So, I made a first time order to
Bus-Boys about a week ago. I ordered 9' of brake
booster vacuum line. I received a call from them
today. He asked me how many buses I had planed on
using the booster vacuum hose on. I told him that I
had only planned on doing one Bus. he told me that 4'
was more than enough to do a bus.  He actually had a
parts book of some kind that told him the exact length
of the hose I needed wich, acording to him, was under
4'. I would have thought that I would need more than
that but he said that 4' should be enough to go from
the booster to the metal tube and from the metal tube
to the manifold port. I will take his word on it for
now. If he is right, and I trust that he is, He saved
me $53.75 Talk about customer service! Any way, just
thought I would share.

Regards,
David Kelly
