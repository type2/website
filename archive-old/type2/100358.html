Subject: Re: [T2] EGR

RickG



&gt;A) If I get the mixture adjusted for daily driving with the EGR stuff
&gt;blocked, it would run rich when I unblocked it for the smog check.

The introduction of an inert gas (in this case exhaust gas) displaces &quot;air&quot; 
and hence effectively reduces the air /fuel ratio (runs richer). This cools 
the chamber and reduces N0x at the cost of increasing the CO and HC.


&gt;
&gt;B) If I get the mixture adjusted for the smog test, it would then run too
&gt;lean after the smog was done and I block off EGR again for daily use.

Yes. You must readjust CO to compensate for lack of EGR.


&gt;&gt;Does anybody have any idea if:
&gt;
&gt;Plan A) would be too rich to pass smog?

Yes. You should run at 4% CO without EGR.
&gt;
&gt;Plan B) would be lean enough to harm the engine?
&gt;
Yes. You should run at 4% CO without EGR.

By the way adjustment of CO is normally made at idle when EGR is not active. 
This adjustment allows a fixed % of the input air flow to pass unmetered. 
The more unmetered air the higher the air/fuel ratio (runs leaner). This 
adjustment effects the air/fuel ratio at and off idle.

&gt;
&gt;This should be interesting...
&gt;
Sounds to me like you have the picture.
