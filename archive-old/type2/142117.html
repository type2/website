Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

There are a few Tatras in a the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville. Great
European car collection. I actually got a ride in the Tatra T-87 (?) on
Father's Day a couple years ago. What a car... Sort of like riding in a
fast late thirties V-8 Ford (original) BUT the noise in the back of the
car where it should be (and it is noticeably noisy like a VW), the IRS
is obvious, stiffer chassis, and the brakes are apparently better!

Go check it out.

We rode in the 3rd Tatra in that pic. The silver one. Also got a ride in
a 3000 km old Citroen 2CV. WAY nicer than my friend's car in Italy which
by comparison was wore out. The Lane car ran so well I actually had to
ask if it was fuel injected (which I knew it shouldn't be). 

The Tatra we rode in had an aircooled V-8 in the rear.

&gt; Not really...The Tatra was one of the most innovative car manufacturers
&gt; during the 1930's...Unfortunately it was also Czech, so any problems with Porsche
&gt; borrowing from the T 97 - (The T97 was an aerodynamic car with an air cooled flat four
&gt; mounted in the rear with independant front and rear suspension with swing axles;
&gt; sound familiar... ?-) - were solved when the German army overran Czechoslovakia.
