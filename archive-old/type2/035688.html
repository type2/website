Well I am now in possesion of the Hub Cap and box-o-misc. stuff. (well,
kinda) I picked it up from Richard this afternoon (thanks for luch Rich) and
took it over to Cliff's house where it will spend the night and attend
Cliff's birthday party Friday night. Hopefully a party will be just the
thing to smack any bad karma out of it.  I figure if Cliff gets the cap
drunk enough it won't remember anything in the morning :).  I'm going to
pick it back up Friday night and Saturday morning it will be on it's way to
Bill in Gainsville.  I sure would like to be one of the people at the tail
end of this journey.  There is a ton of neat stuff in that box now, I can't
imagine how much stuff there is going to be in a few months. Oh, by the way,
the box has come close to capacity so someone down the road is probably
going to have to get a chest or something to keep all this stuff in. I
thought I had the perfect chest in my garage but it turns out it is pretty
badly damaged from when it got soaked last time we moved. I'm so glad I got
to participate in this. I got to rummage through a whole box of other
people's stuff (I love rummaging) and meet two very cool people. Thanks
everyone.

P.S. I hope no one ever gets to smoke the cigar I put in there. (you'll see
what I mean)
