Subject: Re: [T2] Water Cooled Bus

just a thought i seen a bus once that had the front tire replaced on the front with a radiator and it still looked like they had the spare tire on front but this must of taken some thought and exspense...
not sure of all the specs on it though or where i seen it and read about it on the web except it was white...
I prefer my aircooled anyday....
just personal opinion....
i dont want the extra to deal with as far as the leaks and water and such....

peace  jil

&gt;I owned an 84 watercooled westy and it ran great. I did have gasket problems
&gt;but I actually learned to love the bus while fixing them. Replaced gaskets
&gt;on both heads for less than $200 and it went 124,000 before I sold it.
&gt;
&gt;As to converting an air-cooled to a water cooled. I would take the advice of
&gt;another on this list and forget it.
&gt;
&gt;Given the problems you'll encounter and the fact that the watercooleds work
&gt;fine or certainly present no more problems than the air cooled, why worry
&gt;with it?
&gt;
&gt;But, having owned both, I would say that if you get an air-cooled with all
&gt;the right equipment in place, you'll be just as happy and put less strain on
&gt;the environment than if you had a water cooled. Also, you will not have
&gt;waterpump failure nor head gasket leaks...
&gt;
&gt;But, if you really want to know where to put a radiator, then why not look
&gt;at where radiators are on the busses that have them? duh?
&gt;
&gt;They are up front where the air hits them just behind the forward air
&gt;intakes...now, on an air-cooled, there is no air damn to knock the hot air
&gt;that is being cooled by the fan and the radiator off the passengers, so
&gt;you'll have instant heat up front...good in the artic, bad in Georgia in
&gt;July...
&gt;
&gt;so, unless you just like headaches, why not just buy a watercooled?
