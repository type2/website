Subject: Re: [T2]

Got plenty of time; so what would anyone recommend for &quot;unsticking&quot;
an engine that's been sitting for (?) long? Anything to pour into the
spark plug holes/fill the engine before trying to &quot;gently&quot; turn the en-
gine over by hand....Both VW and H2O engines were &quot;donated&quot; to me
in similar condition, so info/experience with either would be appreci-
ated...
TIA
