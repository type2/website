Subject: Bug motor into Bus

Well I picked up my bus. 22 hour round trip adventure to Delaware. (NOTE
- when towing 70 bus w/o motor; remember to plan on supporting tranny or
waste 3 hours in strange town looking for a way to rig it up) more about
that when I finish my web page.

Now the fun begins. Cleaning, figuring out what works, PM, etc. Any
suggestions welcome b4 I install motor. (Tom suggests changing out fuel
lines)

Also, what's this about special tin and rubber seals?

Thanks,
Jim
