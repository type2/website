&gt; Beautiful drive along 199 during the daytime, did that route over
&gt; Memorial Day weekend.  I'm sure it's quite dark at night, so have good
&gt; headlights and watch for deer .. constantly watch for deer.  While my
&gt; driving-at-night-in-the-mountains experiences are all from NorCal
&gt; (Trinity County), I'm sure that's sound advice anywhere.  Deer + car =
&gt; big mess and possibly ruined vacation.

absolutely was up near there (with a rental car) if I had not had my high
beams on I probably wouldn't have seen the deer in time, just stood in the
middle of the road, never moved either, as I slowly drove past it, the
deer watched me otherwise I might have thought it a stuffed animal,
considering it's size it would have made a mess.

  many years ago I clipped a deer at night in Colorado while in my 65
westy.  had a huge dent over the passenger side headlight where a hoof
caught the bus as it jumped out of the way.... still scares me to think
about..

 be careful those deer will make a mellavahess out of the front of a bus,
and likely the person in the front too.
