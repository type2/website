&gt;Hi Dan,
&gt;
&gt;Glad you are enjoying the bus and it's working out and you got the pop top
&gt;sorted.    For westy panels and headliner the choices are AFAICT, find some
&gt;decent ones in a junkyard, or buy some 1/8&quot; birch veneer and make new.  for
&gt;the roof you need 5x5 pieces of plywood, which can be hard to find.  
&gt;
&gt;enjoy
&gt;
Ok- a quick followup:

1. What does AFAICT stand for?

2. If we go for the veneer, I assume I would find some very thin plywood, 
apply the veneer, then cut (and in the case of the roof, bend) to fit. Is 
that right?

3. Also, I have most or all of the original interior Westie pieces 
(except the roof and door panels), but they are in bad shape. What do you 
think about peeling off the old veneer and applying the new? And, if that 
would work, what should I use as trim for the edges?

Westie Class 101! 

Thanks,

Dan
