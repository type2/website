Subject: Re: [T2] CV knocking
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL


Weelll,
Does it stop if you take it out of gear and coast?
Yes? ........sounds like a CV
Does it get louder  when turning one way 
and diminish when turning the other way?
Yes? .........sounds like a CV
  Crawl under the side it &quot;sounds&quot; like it might be coming
from. Take the axle and do a push pull action on it... nice
an hard (with one hand). Not up and down but back and forth
tween the wheel an the tranny side. Drive it an see if the
noise went away.. if not, do the same on the other side. Do
this with the E brake on... not parked in gear.
  This method of locating which side is making the noise
has worked for me with both my 80 van-O-gone (which is
gone) and my 74. It sometimes will even make the thing stop
knocking for a long time... I have no idea why this works
but it has for me. Some claim that the knocking doesnt hurt
anything but I think it has to if driven like that for
long.
-------------------------------
......started
making a loud clunking noise after traveling at higher 
speeds for a while.
Espeacially while accelerating.  Maybe i am having a 
similiar problem if
anyone can help me deterimine the culprit of my noise i 
would appreciate it.
