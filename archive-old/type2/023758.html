Subject: Re: How much for used hubs?
Date: Thu, 3 May 2001 11:15:32 +0100 

Shawn,
	You shouldn't need to redrill the hubs. The old studs will tap
out and new ones tap in. It doesn't even take that long.

 You can do this yourself, with a little care. Put a large socket 
(or similar) under the hub around the head of the old stud to
distribute the load and avoid warping, thread a wheelnut (preferably
an old one!) onto the end of the stud to protect the threads and then
tap it out with a big hammer.
 The new studs should tap back in in the same sort of way. I had to
do a little file work on a few that were a smidgeon oversize.

 Once you've got everything back together make sure you check 
and tighten your wheelnuts very frequently in the first few hundred
miles, as the new studs may take a little time to settle on their
final home.

 One final detail- the studs I bought have a longer unthreaded part
than the stock ones, so on the rear wheels I need to use a thin spacer
(2-3mm) with the stock wheels (ie my spare!!) or the nuts won't seat
onto the rim properly.

Cheers,
	W.
