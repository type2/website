&gt;I knew mentioning cutting the cabinets would draw some responses (not to

Scrue him/her.  :)

&gt;As to the stick on convex mirrors for a dollar or so, I've got one.  It
&gt;really doesn't do the trick for me.  

Ditto.  I drove a '72 Westy for a while and really disliked that blind
spot.  And it IS a blind spot, no matter how many little mirrors you stick
on.  

&gt;I have a hard enough time finding time to finish installing my rebuilt
&gt;engine and cleaned tranny, and all the little odds and ends that go with it.
&gt;I just want to camp and _USE_ my bus.  If I can make it more usable in an
&gt;afternoon, then why not?  

Right now, those cabinets are plentiful in the boneyards - I wouldn't pay
$10 for one.  No reason to feel bad about chopping one up unless it were in
brand-new condition.  Many Westy interiors get crushed along with the rest
of the camper at auto wreckers every month - why isn't anyone upset by that?

As for whether to remain stock or modify/improve, I came to that crossroads
a few years ago and decided on the latter.  I do a lot of camping in my bus
and I decided I really wanted a more efficient interior layout than what
Safare gave me originally, although I am trying to preserve the more unique
aspects of the layout like the U-bed and seating arrangement.

In the extreme cases, I am still bothered though.  Like when someone rips
out a complete mint Westy interior and replaces it with a bare plywood
storage cabinet and a piece of 4&quot; foam.  If you're going to do that, please
start with a passenger bus, and save the original rear seats up in the attic.
