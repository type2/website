I agree, I LIKE my Hall effect distributor.  Adjusting points 
has always been a PITB.  Unfortunately the coil that I had problems
with is in just such a system.  Alas, they have a limited 
lifespan too. (1980 Ca version Vanagon)

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; Except for antique cars wishing to be perfect, everybody should change away
&gt; from the 1920's technology of points/condensor/coil ignition.  The points
&gt; will last forever, the coil lasts longer (maybe forever), the plugs last
