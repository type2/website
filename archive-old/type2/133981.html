Subject: re: front door seals

Bill; 

I must be missing something when looking at your pictures, but I have
never seen the door seal wrap around the outer lip of the door metal so
that it's visible like that. Again, I'm probably missing something, but it
looks like it's installed wrong. The seal sits down in the channel. 

Of course, I don't remember a groove on my front door seal either, and I
just replaced it last night. 

I'm confused.
