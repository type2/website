Johnny,

Investing in an alternator is your call, really.  I have a couple generators 
in my garage from when I replaced one with an alternator.  If you go that 
way, PULL THE ENGINE OUT FIRST.  I did it with the engine in and it was a 
PITA. 

I, too, have a lot of electricals and I felt I would benefit from an 
alternator because my ammeter was not showing much current.  

New alternator?  No change.  Boy, was I bent.

I wound up running several large gauge wires from the back to the front, then 
back again because ALL the juice in the bus must first run through the 
alternator to get a good reading (its almost not worth the trouble).  In the 
end, I decided getting an alternator wasn't helping that much so that if this 
puppy goes out, I'll put the generator back in.

On the other hand, if you are running auxiliary lights, an electric heater, 
windshield wipers, big ol' honkin' stereo all at the same time . . . .
