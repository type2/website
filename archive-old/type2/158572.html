hello John How ya doing well I hope, still YMCA ing it? How you like  the new 
town?   The correct carb for alt has the linkage configured so that  it 
doesn't hit. You can change that part of the linkage and it will work. I have  also 
bent the arm and ground away some of the body of the alt so that it will  
clear . That works good also, I don't know of any spacer that was made for this  
purpose. All of the new carbs I have seen have the old style linkage. I might  
have some on the carb shelf if you need it  later  Mark d
