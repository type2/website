Chris,

I put in a VDO tach a couple of years ago and had the same problem - the =
needle jumped all over the place.  I found one of the solutions in the =
archives you came across.  I used the diode from Radio Shack cat no. =
276-1104 (1N4005).  If memory serves me correctly, I put the diode in =
line with the input from the tach and it settled right down.  It's =
worked well for me ever since.

Good luck,

Markus
