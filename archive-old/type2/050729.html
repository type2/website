Well gang, this is NQ here.  Can you believe it?  Here I sit in Ronnie's
shop at his computer by the very phone that I've talked to him on over the
past few years as he talked me through my bus resurrection.  I'm still in
some state of mild shock...			

Anyways, I just uploaded about 200 photos from the event that were taken
this afternoon and Stephen G. already has them up on the site.  If you
couldn't make it, do the next best thing and visit the following URL.  Be
prepared because these photos are graphic intensive but well worth the wait.

Enjoy the pictures and stay tuned - this event ain't over yet.
