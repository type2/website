Jon Pederson, Helpline Services, California Air Resources Board, said:
&gt; Dear Mr. Wagner:
&gt; 
&gt; Greetings once again.  Thank you for sharing this last assemblage of
&gt; information
&gt; with me.  After reviewing our ARB Web page
&gt; (http://www.arb_dot_ca_dot_gov/msprog/avrp/avrp.htm), I am somewhat puzzled. 
&gt; First, the
&gt; word &quot;voluntary&quot; is in boldface type and used in several places. 
These
&gt; programs
&gt; exist in several places throughout California and except for the pilot
&gt; project I
&gt; mentioned which is operated under ARB's auspices, the other &quot;scrap&quot;
&gt; programs are
&gt; operated regionally, usually with the help of the local air district
&gt; having the
&gt; jurisdiction for that area.  So, if I voluntarily scrap my vehicle,
what
&gt; difference does it make to me if they smash the whole thing or not?

It doesn't make any difference to you, but it makes a lot of
difference to those who depend upon the supply of used parts to keep
their own vehicles running.  The used parts industry is one example of
recycling that has been working well for decades and the smog people
want to eliminate it.

Also, &quot;voluntary&quot; programs have a habit of becoming &quot;mandatory&quot; once
the door is opened.  How &quot;voluntary&quot; will the program be once the
standards for the roadside sensors start being tightened up? The
choice will be &quot;sell it to the crusher or just let the city confiscate
it for non-registration.&quot;

&gt; There is another angle, though, and this is the toughest part, as
far as
&gt; I
&gt; know.  This is the reason we have a pilot program in the South Coast
Air
&gt; Basin.
&gt; We are trying to find out just how much &quot;bang for the buck&quot; there is
&gt; when
&gt; vehicles are removed from the road, e.g., just how much air pollution
&gt; will be
&gt; stopped when this vehicle no longer functions?  This information is of
&gt; critical
&gt; importance because many people want to assign a dollar value to the
&gt; amount of
&gt; emissions that are reduced.  Clearly, if certain parts of the vehicle
&gt; are put
&gt; back into use (even if they don't pollute the air), it will directly
&gt; effect the
&gt; monetary value within this overall process.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, what is a &quot;fair market value&quot; for a scrapped car?  $500? 
&gt; $750?
&gt; $200?  Unless that vehicle is 100% removed from the vehicle
population,
&gt; we
&gt; automatically have a &quot;sliding scale&quot; and the potential for some major
&gt; administrative headaches!

Give me a break!  It's obvious that the real reason for not allowing
parting-out is to make sure that other vehicles are junked sooner for
lack of parts.  Saying that allowing parting will skew their data is a
very nice bureaucratic ploy, but false as a $3 bill.

&gt; I appreciate the opportunity to explore these issues with
&gt; you!

I don't doubt it, since he's getting paid for it.
