Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Stalling at deceleration

Chris,

Did you check to make sure the idle cut-off solenoid is screwed in nice
and tight? When they're just a little loose they cause problems like you
describe. I finally put a drop of the weakest grade locktite on mine and
I haven't had any trouble since.

&gt; Twice we experienced an annoying problem that I recall coming and going once
&gt; before but dont recall if it was this motor. The subject is a 1600
&gt; DP,009,34pict3, black coil, seals and tin in and in fine working order.
&gt; 
&gt; When the bus is well into its operating temperature range it stalls upon
&gt; deceleration. For example, Running at 45 miles an hours and approaching a
&gt; stop light I slow down in gear, put it in neutral and it dies. Turning the
&gt; ignition over and it dies. Turn it over and give it some gas(say about 1500
&gt; RPM and it is fine unless the idle is dropped down agin in neutral. Under
&gt; load at any RPM and runs like a top.
&gt; 
&gt; My first guesses were vac leak, bad or disconnected cut off solenoid but
&gt; alas there is more. If the bus stalls on decel(say approaching a stop light)
&gt; I put the bus into 2nd and pop the clutch to bump start it. Voila it fires
&gt; up and idles just dandily! Furthermore it did not stall at all for the next
&gt; 300 decels to idle while negotiating a bumper to bumper Interstate traffic
&gt; jam. After the show it did not do it at all in the parking lot. The problem
&gt; recurred up arrive home(100 miles later) and getting caught in Downtwon club
&gt; traffic.
