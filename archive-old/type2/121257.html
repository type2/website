Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

Hey there, long time reader, first time poster.  :)

If you guys are looking for a good compact PC system, something like this
might work.  I haven't purchased one yet, but the dimensions are perfect for
fitting in a bus.  I'll probably get one as soon as I'm done with the more
important work on my Riviera, like replacing the rice exhaust some wise guy
decided to install on it.  :)

Steve-O has some good recommendations, esp ties into my suggestion of a
(I meant it be a *small*) UPS- it's basic advantage being power
regulation. I mention it not for it's battery features but for it's
power regulating abilities.

Doesn't have to a boat anchor.

Also like the 'slap it in a cabinet' or under a panel idea. This can be
performed with a laptop or a mini ATX;

(Wow, this link is kinda old, but I'm tired and thats all the
researching I'm doing tonight, sorry)

In the case of a laptop it could incorporate a base station/port
replicator allowing for portability as well as the benefits of being a
more hardwired install.

I like this thread, sorry if it drifts from the original poster's design
specs.

Feel free to wrangle us back on task though.
