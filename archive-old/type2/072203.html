&gt;&gt; haha. i'm doing a survey
&gt;&gt; on herb users. this survey is totally private i wont
&gt;&gt; give out names or
&gt;&gt; nothing yuh know. i'll tally up the responses and
&gt;&gt; post them in a couple
&gt;&gt; daze. just reply to this message and check off your
&gt;&gt; answers.

&gt;This post sums up the only real downside to owning and
&gt;driving a bus....everyone assumes that we are all like
&gt;ol' ras dave, here.
&gt;
&gt;Not only is this post WAY off topic, but it's
&gt;inapropriate and foolish as well. Perhaps a little
&gt;less &quot;herb&quot; would allow him to see that.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I don't care what drugs you or anyone else choose
&gt;to do, but please...keep it to yourself and don't give
&gt;the rest of us a bad image. It's bad enough already.


Thanks for your reply Jaime, you are right on the money!!  In my 22 years
of teaching I have seen too many students with some sort of drug problem.
And I am VERY tired of hearing my VW's called &quot;roach coaches&quot;.

I like to get my &quot;highs&quot; on the ground, driving my bus!!  There is no
better high than a natural one!!
