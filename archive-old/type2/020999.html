&gt; Curious if there is anyone who has seen or knows of a place to find a spare
&gt; tire for a bus that is very narrow like a donut tire. 

I did the same thing Bob,took the spare off the front,, added the emblem and had
good intentions to add the spare, and never did find a donut tire that would
fit, so I took a good donut that I got from another car, and redrilled the Vw
pattern inbetween the chev pattern, worked for me,,
I don't plan on driving at high speeds or hundres of miles on the homemade rim
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/spareVWtire.htm for pictures near the bottom

But , if I was adding my suggestion, which I plan to do,,, cut the center out of
a stock vw rim ,and weld it into the donut rim,,, 
I use a lathe to cut the centers out of both rims so that it is easy to weld in
and spin true!
The taper part that the wheel nut tightens to is very important, and the
homemade one is not a very good taper

[I switched centers plenty of time for OffRoad racing cars,, and they take quite
a pounding, high speed spinning too,,, and we balanced them, so that gives me
confidence in building my own spare]

I want to modify a newer style hoist like set up that you see on todays vans so
I can put the spare rim under the belly of my camper...
I should do it soooooon! 
I have driven 100,000 miles now, same bus ,,,with no spare ,, only that gunk in
a can! 
I have just put new tires on and I don't need a puncture!
