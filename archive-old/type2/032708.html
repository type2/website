Subject: Thing for sale (no bus content)

A guy I know has a Thing (type 181) for sale.  P-mail me if you want to

interested, here's the particulars.

 LOOKING TO GET IN THE LOW 4,000 TO HIGH 3,000 FOR THE CAR.  NO RUSH ON
 SELLING, I AM CONTINUING THE REFURBISHING OF THE CAR AND THE PRICE WILL
BE
 ADJUSTED. I CAN NOT TELL HOW MANY HOURS INVESTED( MOST SPARE TIME).  I
 HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 YRS.  UPGRADES HAPPEN WHEN MONEY
IS
 AVAILABLE.  I HAVE SPENT ABOUT  $7400.00 TOTAL BETWEEN THE CAR AND
 UPGRADES.  INTENTIONS ARE A LOW COMPRESSION 1776, REGEAR THE TRANS TO
 HIGHER ROAD SPEED, POSSIBILITY OF A GENE BERG 5 SPEED, NEW PAINT COLOR,

 AND RHINO LINING OF THE INTERIOR TUB AND TRUNK  AREA.  AS YOU CAN READ
IT
 IS STILL A PROJECT CAR BUT ALSO A SECOND VEHICLE USED DAILY.  MILEAGE
ON
 MY PART IS ABOUT 20 MILES ROUND TRIP TO WORK AND HOME AGAIN.  I HAVE
MADE
 TWO TRIPS TO NORTH CAROLINA AND AT LEAST 12 TRIPS TO CHARLESTON, OTHER
 THAN THAT LOW DRIVING MILES.  MILEAGE IS INACCURATE ON THE CAR I
BELIEVE
 THE SPEEDO WAS CHANGED?  ANY WAY IT IS STILL A GOOD PROJECT TO
COMPLETION
 CAR.  DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT GO BUT MAY HAVE NO CHOICE.  WOULD LIKE TO
FIND
 A PASSIONATE OWNER FOR THE LITTLE THING TO KEEP IT IN USE.  LET ME KNOW

 WHO MAY LIKE TO BUY IT.  I MAY HAVE AVAILABILITY TO 4 TO 5 OTHERS IS
 VARIOUS CONDITIONS.  SEE YA.:)

I don't mind going nowhere as long as it's an interesting path.
