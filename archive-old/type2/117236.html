Subject: engine install question

hello all.  i've been a lurker on the list for the past few months as i was
in the process of acquiring my first bus.  well i've now got one! (1976
Westy with FI).  anyway...over the past weekend i pulled the engine to
install a new clutch and throw-out bearing, clean the engine compartment,
etc.

the engine removal was difficult but it was accomplished (followed Muir and
Bentley).

Then it came time to reinstall -- a friend and i got the engine in and
lined up after awhile but by then it was dark, so we called it a day.  went
back out last night to finish the job and we've managed to get the engine
to within 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; of its final destination  (i.e., the lower trans
studs are currently flush with the hole they will eventually come out of in
1/4 to 1/2&quot;).  we can't seem to make any further progress... i'd like to
finish the engine install as it is beginning to consume all my thoughts...

Anyone have any ideas, suggestions, or words of encouragement to help with
finishing the job.  all help would be appreciated!

Thanks...Chris.
