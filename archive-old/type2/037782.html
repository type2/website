Subject: windshield removal

It's not easy. I've had luck removing one in one piece a few times but only 
with an assistant and only if we both stay on it right to the end. 
concentrate. I used a butter knife around the outside of the seal on the 
exterior while an assistant gently pushed from the inside. patience is key. 
pure speculation because I can't remember, but the top middle first then 
slowly outward and down the sides not trying to remove it too soon might 
work. I haven't had as good luck starting in one lower corner but who knows?
