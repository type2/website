Subject: Re: My Kids broke my Bus

  Since my Westy is my daily driver and only vehicle I took
it down to my mechanic and he readjusted the points and
timed the bus for me.  Free.  I'm going to wait until I buy
a second vehicle, probably a bug, before I start really
tinkering with the engine.  That way, if I screw it up I
still have a way to get to work to pay for my mistakes.  I'm
eager to learn.
