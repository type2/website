&gt; Anyone have experience putting a Type4 motor in a late model Bus?  I've
&gt; read the Archives and really didn't find any how to.  I'm going to but the
&gt; 65 (even though it doesn't have a Ambulance Fan) for $680.  But it needs a
&gt; motor and 12 volt conversion.  I have a lead on a 72 with a bad body for
&gt; $400, the motor has 76,000 miles on it.  How much work to making it
&gt; work?  Can I cut enough out of the tranny to make the larger Flywheel work?
