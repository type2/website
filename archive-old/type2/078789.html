Subject: Vacuum Zoom

This is a Friday testimonial, folks.

I have run the 009 distributor in several T4 powered busses over the years,
and I have been largely satisfied. I installed an 009 in my latest baby, a
74 Riviera with an 1800 and Weber progressive, and drove around quite
happily. Driving to work every day, going on day trips, even a 1200 mile
weekend trip across four states. I adapted my driving style to the
peculiarities of the beast, I suppose.

Well, a week ago I installed a Bosch SVDA vacuum/centrifugal distributor
that I bought from John at aircooled_dot_net. I ahve seen the light and been
converted, folks. Smoother takes-offs and gear changes, more power on hills
and, as advertised, an extra 3 MPG in city driving. I think it's running a
tad cooler as well, but it never ran all that hot before so it's hard to
tell.

At any rate, I urge all you 009-ers out there to consider changing
over--it's worth it. I know that just about any A/C VW can be made to run
pretty well with an 009, but there's a big difference between 'pretty well'
and 'really well.' I'm enjoying 'really well' a lot.
