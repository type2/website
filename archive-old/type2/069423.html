What characterizes a Westfalia? 
I had guessed, long before I actually knew
anything about VW (Engine's in the BACK?),
that it referred to the popup tent, and that
it was some kind of aftermarket thing, thus
the non volkswagen name.  I assumed it was 
an australian deal.  

Well, I'm wrong.  So what's the straight dope.
Why are some busses &quot;campers&quot; while others are
&quot;station wagens&quot; and &quot;transporters&quot;?

What are you looking at when you say &quot;That one's
a westy.&quot;
- - - - 
Westfalia is a German company that has long outfitted WV buses as campers.
  Most of the later ones (68 &amp; on)  have pop tops.   some dont.  some early
ones do.   sometimes it says WESTFALIA on the pop top.   once you see one,
they are easy to identify,  very well and sturdily designed campers that have
given many people great joy.   :)    they contracted with VW and the campers
were sold through the vw dealerships.

note- i am mainly coming from a split screen perspective, and some of this
may not apply to later buses.

BUS Models  -  ALL type 2s  are transporters - no matter how many windows

panel van - no windows in the sides except cab windows - your basic delivery
van,  just painted grey in the rear with no rear seating

combi-   three windows on side,   came with back seat, middle an option,  no
paneling in rear.  a step up from the panel .  &quot;combi&quot;nation people and goods
mover

truck,  single or double cab - what it sounds like
- - - 
these commercial vehicles were almost always painted one colour

microbus-   like combi, but with complete two tone interior paneling, three
rows of seats, and a headliner .    sold as 'station wagon'  for dutty
reasons in the us.

deluxe microbus -  had extra windows in back, also corner windows and larger
rear window if a 63 or earlier,  extra chrome goodys, and exterior trim.
  may, or may not,  have a sunroof and skylights
- - - 
these passenger vehicles were almost always given two tone paint

Westys were usually buildt on kombi  bodies.    they made a wide variety of
camper kits, too.  

any bus outfiitted for camping is a camper.   as well as westys, there are
sundials, rivieras, petaluma, and home made campers.
