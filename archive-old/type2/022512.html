I probably get to work tomorrow putting a front corner on a Vanagon :(.
Anyway I was just a wondering what other kinds of VW's other listee's own.
(this may be another attempt to get other Type 4 owners to come out of the
closet) Another reason is I'm gonna print my list so I know at a glance just
how full my yard is.

57' single cab
58' kombi
59' std
69' riveria camper
73' 7 pass
77' riveria

64' ghia

56' bug
61' bug (storing for a friend)
64' bug
73' s bug

71' 411
