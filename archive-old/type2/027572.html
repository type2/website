I was wondering if anybody on the list knew of a good place to order the 
cargo floor section. I found 2 sites in the U.K. so far that have it, but 
none in the states. Found them on http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/ for 120 
pounds (Left Hand Drive) which is about $170.40 American before shipping. I 
also saw them on http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk/katalogue/newbody.html for 
29.95 pounds per side which is about $42.52 a piece, about $85 all together 
before shipping. Does anyone know why there would be such a big price 
difference and who I should go with??
Thanks for the help,
