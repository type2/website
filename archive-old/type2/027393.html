Hi all,
I have a 71' camper that originally had a pop-top. The PO screwed a piece of 
plexiglass over the opening. I would like to replace the plexi with 
something besides a pop-top. I've seen sliding rag tops on some buses and 
was wondering if I might be able to adapt something to my roof. Anybody have 
any experience with something like this?

Thanks,
Brendan
