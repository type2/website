My manual says &quot;vehicles with automatic transmissions manufactured 
through January 1976 do not have a decel valve.&quot;  But I don't think the 
valves function is to contribute to smooth deceleration.  I believe it's 
there to prevent, in effect, the throttle &quot;slamming shut&quot; creating a 
temporary very-rich (and very polluting) situation.
