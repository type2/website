&gt; FWIW there are MUCH cheaper alternatives to rattle cans at $6 a pop. My
&gt; local auto paint supplier sells basic primers for $30 a gallon (I think
&gt; it was). Covers MUCH better than rattle cans so there is more primer to
&gt; sand on and thus quicker to get the job done. Same with paint - much
&gt; better paint available by the quart and gallon for less than cases of
&gt; rattle cans. some suppliers are higher than others. Seems like NAPA was
&gt; higher than the auto body supplier and prob equal in quality.

the problem wasn't the ability, heck I had the equipment and had sprayed
Imron,  the problem was I could not take the bus out of service for more
than a single day.  it was my only ride

so I did in one day a full prep of a single panel on the bus primed, ate,
painted. cleaned up.   so took 9 weeks or so one day a week painting. (3
side panels each side, front, back, roof) started on roof, then passenger
side front door area, then worked around the bus doing the front last.

probably cost a lot more than what it would have to fire up my compressor
and do it &quot;right&quot; but it was do it that way or don't paint at all.

so did the best I could under the circumstances, I don't really reccomend
it, but it will work
