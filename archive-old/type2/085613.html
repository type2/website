Subject: A couple of questions, idle and brakes

On my 79, I am having trouble with  idle. First starting in the morning is 
difficult (I will run a test on the cold start - hopefully this weekend), but 
also when the bus has run for a while - say 10 or 15 miles or more and I turn 
it off run into a store or what ever and then come back it has a hard time 
idling. What makes it even weirder is that if I drive a block or two and have 
to sit at a light or stop sign it idles fine. Any suggestions??

The bus was not used much this winter and I am driving her a bunch now. Before 
I started driving her a lot among other things I adjusted the rear brakes 
and the emergency brake cables. Now just several hundred miles later I need 
to adjust the emergency again. I am not sure if the cables are streched out 
or ....  Additionally, I am getting a high pitched noise intermittently upon 
breaking. The shoes are fairly new and things looked good when I replaced 
them last year (remember the bus has not been driven that much). Again any 
suggestions would be appreciated. TIA
