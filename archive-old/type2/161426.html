Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Hubcap Idea

	I'm currently in communication with Greg and it look's like we should
be able to work out something so I can get the hubcap to EB.....then
West from there.  I'll post details as they come.

Peace, Troy

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I HAVE LOCATED THE HUBCAP!!!   There is no need for a replacement.
&gt;
&gt; I'd suggest we let Troy pick it up; bring it to EveryBus for Mark to
&gt; drool on and then take it west again to give to Don.
