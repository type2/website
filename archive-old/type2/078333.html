Subject: Front Spoiler

Might anyone on the list be able to direct me in the proper direction in 
which to obtain a front spoiler/ air dam for my 1978 Baywindow Bus? I've 
reviewed the archived materials, and found that the spoiler offered by JC 
Whitney is NLA. I've been very interested in obtaining a similar spoiler to 
the one that Mr. Bob Wallace has fitted to his 1998 Brazilian T-2, as shown 
in the Library section of the Type 2 web site. Any and all help would be very 
much appreciated.
Regards,
Robert
