Just a few notes on these multiple electrode spark plugs.

You do not get better ignition or burning of fuel by using these plugs.
That is simply because your spark only uses one electrode at a time.
Always.  It seeks the path of least resistance and goes there.  That means
your spark will jump to the side electrode that is the least worn/closest to
the center electrode.  That is the only place the spark will go on that
ignition sequence.  To one side electrode.  It won't skip around and hit all
2 or 4 or what have you.  The next time it fires it will again go the path
of least resistance and jump to the nearest electrode again.  This may or
may not be the same electrode.  What it  will not do is jump to all
electrodes at once as the marketers would have us believe.  You may have
noticed when SplitFire plugs first came out they pictured a spark jumping to
both electrodes at once.  &quot;Wow!  That's got to be better than my old single
electrode plug!&quot; sez I.  So I looked into it.  I have a friend who is an EE
and quickly set me straight.  Not only that but SplitFire can no longer show
that picture/illustration of the two simultaneous sparks.  Because it just
ain't so!  The truth in advertising people actually got to them!  Amazing.
:-)

The only benefit I can see from multiple electrode plugs is that they most
probably last longer.  Just simply because they have more electrode(s) to
wear down.  They are geared towards new cars that don't want you to pop the
hood until you've reached 100,000 miles.  But probably not worth a real
premium for us bussers who are checking our plugs every 3000 or so anyway.

Just my $.02.  YMMV,

Hello everybody,

I was wondering if i put into my t4 2000 engine another spark plugs like the
ones used for electronic fuel injected driven engines, the ones with 3 or 4
terminals on the head of the spark plug, would i get lower engine temps
because of better ignition and burning of the fuel? I also use my engine
with LPG and i think it would ignite the gas better. Does anybody have any
experiences with using diferent types of spark plugs?
