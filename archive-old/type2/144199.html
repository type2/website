Subject: engine swap ?

&gt; Will a 1600 drop into a later (72 or 73) bus?
All international busses, non US, had the good
old 1600 DP all the way through '79.

I wouldn't say ALL international busses, but it
was certainly the standard endinge.  Also, 1600s
didn't die in 79.  The non-US spec Transporters
(&quot;vanagons&quot; to we Mericuns and Canucks) had 1600s
until the end of the European aircooled
Transporters, 1983.  I don't believe any other
aircooled T2 transporter (Mexican or Brezilian)
had anything except the 1600.  There were never
any pancake engine busses down there. 

 



Happy bussin'
