Hi Skip and List

I do make these with logo and custom color to match your paint.  They are
not currently listed on my site but have make one without logo for another
listie.  They are made out of marine grade vinyl like my split window bus
bras with high quality bungie instead of elastic to ensure it will last a
good long time.  Logos availible in silver, white or match another color on
your bus.  p-mail me for more info.
