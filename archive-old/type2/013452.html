&gt; I've never owned a VW other than a bus, but what
&gt; I've heard is that the 009 is good for bugs, ghias,
&gt; etc.  The reason they're not good for busses is that
&gt; the bus, being a much larger and heavier vehicle
&gt; than other AC VW's, needs a different advance curve
&gt; than the 009 has.  Part of the problem is the 009
&gt; doesn't have an adjustable advance curve, or else
&gt; we'd all probably be singing it's praises.  If you
&gt; can't find a stock vacuum-advance dizzy, Mallory
&gt; makes an outstanding VW dizzy that has something
&gt; like 27 different advance curves you can set just by
&gt; changing the springs.  I just bought one, but
&gt; haven't installed it yet, so unfortunately, I can't
&gt; give a first-hand account on it's performance.

I have heard tell that as far as Bosch dizzy's go, the
050 is the one to have for a bus.  (Can't remember
WHERE I heard it, but it did stick in my head)

Comments?

Or is this yet another NLA part like the famed 010?
