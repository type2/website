Subject: What is an unrestored, original paint, original brakes, original tire

&gt; What is an unrestored, original paint, original brakes,
&gt; original tires excellent condition 76 non Westy bus worth?

Last year I bought the '69 Clipper that can be seen in the book &quot;The
original VW bus&quot; that most of you have. It's a beautiful original unrestored
9 seater with about 60,000 miles on it's original 1600 cc SP engine. It
still smells 'new' so to speak. I paid about $ 7000 for it.

The year before that I bought a '78 de luxe, 2 litre automatic 8 seater,
100,000 miles, for about $2500. This was a solid bus, no major work needed
to drive it. However it was not 'nice' if you know what I mean. The interior
was dirty and upholstery slightly ripped. And a few more things. It had been
resprayed fairly recently but at various spots rust was coming thru again.
Not major but in need of some attention.  I found out that turning this bus
into a real 'nice' one (and have it done properly) would cost about $10,000
(which included a complete paint job, interior refurnishing and engine
overhaul).

After that it's value may have been about $5000 to $6000. So, yes if you can
buy a completely restored bus (and know for sure it has been done right!) it
will be a lot cheaper that performing that restoration yourself unless you
or your neighbour happens to work in a body shop.
So after buying the Clipper I sold the '78. I still have 4 buses in my
fleet, the latest addition being a brand new Eurovan, panel van with double
cab (5 seater). The others: the '69 Clipper, a '77 Westy and an '81 vanagon
(now up for sale).
