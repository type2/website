&lt;&lt; I don't know if there's anything to be gained by recommending specific
 products, or even by collecting recommendations- most of this info can
 probably be gleaned from the archives. On the other hand a list of what
 type of oil people use and why might be useful for reference, especially
 if it included information on climate and typical vehicle usage.
  Anyone want to collect this? I'm kinda busy at the moment... :-(
 but the approach I'd take would be to trawl the archives for relevant
 posts, summarise and tabulate the information, post it to the list for
 further input and then arrange for the updated version to go into the
 library at type2_dot_com. &gt;&gt;

anybody up to the task.???  you've got my support just not my time or knowhow 
to get it done.
