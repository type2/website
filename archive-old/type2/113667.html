Subject: Re: [T2] die grinder

&gt;I'm afraid I've worked with H-F equipment too often (some even mine-
&gt;mea culpa) to recommend almost anything that has a motor or is go-
&gt;ing to be in constant use...There's a reason the stuff's cheap and it
&gt;can't just be the exchange rates...

I bought a 6&quot; sander / polisher.

Sounds like the gear box was make with square gears or something. I have to 
wear hearing protection to run it with any load on it at all.

It was cheap though.

It is quieter now, think the gears or bearings or wearing in or something.

On the other hand all of my Porter-Cable, Makita and Milwaukee tools are 
A++ from the start and some are over 10 years old now. I expect with my use 
(occasional) my grandchildren will be using them (I'm 32 and my son is 3)...

If you can afford it, don't buy the cheapest stuff unless you are prepared 
for a tool with a lifetime of a dozen uses.
