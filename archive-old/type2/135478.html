&lt;&lt; IIRC, bleeding sequence is furthest from the master cylinder to the

Right Rear

Right Front

I thought so too...But after running a quart of fluid thru the system
(into a mason jar of fluid) according to the Bentley sequence - 

Right front
Left front
Right rear
Left rear
It took two passes through the four corners of the bus, but
the master cylinder finally burped the air that had remained 
trapped despite my best bench bleeding effort(s)... ;-(
With new pads and shoes and rear cylinders, the pedal is now
hard and high and ready to fling my coffee cup agaist the 
windshield... ;-)
