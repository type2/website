These facts can be very helpful. But they can give you a false sense of
assurance. Anyone with an automobile out of warranty should assume that
their engine could very well give up the ghost tomorrow because of
defects, poor maintenance, or poor workmanship that won't show up in
any diagnostic. Most of these problems will give some warning through
odd noises, but (to cite an example) a vacuum leak that develops
because of unseen wear in a hose, wear that leads to a crack, can
develop unexpectedly and can lead to a burnt piston and back pressure
without much warning at all (except maybe a faulty idle).

In the end, it's a matter of temperament. If you tend toward optimism,
go ahead and get the tests and diagnostics. Then, if all is well, go
ahead and be optimistic. If you're a pessimist, be aware that engines
die without warning. Indeed, some die within minutes of departing from
work by a mechanic. Look through this list's archives if you don't
believe me.
