Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down? and parts for sale


&gt;Mom's new CRV mounts exactly
&gt;the same way, should be interesting to see if it rust.  Another thing
&gt;about the mounts is they leave something sticking out past the
&gt;bumper on the nose of the bus which can also bode poorly in a light
&gt;front tap that would have been just covered by a new bumper but
&gt;instead warps the entire nose of the bus, a friend sort of did this in
&gt;reverse when he hit a blazer's rear spare mount, although he did
&gt;probably go under the bumper with his bumper so who knows.


The CR-V tire does not touch the body work anywhere - it is wholly 
suspended by the mount...
