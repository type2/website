Subject: Re: [T2] Color Question(statistics of my m-plate files)

&gt; What was the most popular/favorite color or color
&gt; combination for the transporter?

I looked in my M-plate file to see what the most
popular colors were (in the factory). I only did 1968
and 1969 models. It is a lot of work to translate all
the m-plates into colors and count them. (I keep a
database file of M-plates I found in buses and those
that people have sent me)

Here are the statistics for 68-69 type 2's. I observed
104 vehicles, about 500.000 were made in these years
so judge for yourself how reliable my observation is
;-)

1968-1969:

color / percentage / number of vehicles
lotus white L282      18%  19
pearl white L87       16%  17
neptune blue L50K     10%  10
montana red L30H       9%   9
savanna beige L620     8%   8
velvet green L512      7%   7
fire brigade red L256  7%   7
light grey L345        6%   6
unknown code/color     5%   5
titian red L555        4%   4
olive green (army)     4%   4
briliant blue L50H     3%   3
primered               2%   2
ebony black L41        1%   1
delta green L610       1%   1
mail yellow            1%   1
		
White was the most popular by far (lotus white and
pearl white with 36 vehicles together!)


yours,


Vincent
