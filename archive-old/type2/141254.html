Subject: Paris - 1978 - Not totally bus content...

&quot;On an August morning in 1978, French filmmaker Claude Lelouch mounted a
gyro-stabilized camera to the bumper of a Ferrari 275 GTB and had a friend, a
professional Formula 1 racer, drive at breakneck speed through the heart of
Paris. The film was limited for technical reasons to 10 minutes; the course
was from Porte Dauphine, through the Louvre, to the Basilica of Sacre Coeur.

No streets were closed, for Lelouch was unable to obtain a permit.

The driver completed the course in about 9 minutes, reaching nearly 140 MPH in
some stretches. The footage reveals him running real red lights, nearly
hitting real pedestrians, and driving the wrong way up real one-way streets.

Upon showing the film in public for the first time, Lelouch was arrested. He
has never revealed the identity of the driver, and the film went underground
until a DVD release a few years ago&quot;

On the last minutes of the film, just pay attention to the right side under
the trees (they are parked by the sidewalk)...
It reminded me, Billy P. accident &quot;Guy runs a red light in a pickup and is
halfway into the intersection by the time I see him because I'm too busy
verifying the fact that I have a green light before proceeding thru....&quot;

Regards from Porugal!
