Kevin,

I had the same kind of problems last summer. When I bought the van it
was working OK Fooling around the engine I tried to get the FI harness
off the ECU the wrong way. It took me most of the summer to figure out
that I had accidentally broken one of the fine  wires inside the Harness plug.

Good luck.

&gt; About two weeks ago I wrote and told you about my bus that runs fine until it warms up and then runs like crap, if I can even keep it running.  Many responded back and said replace the sensor by cyclinder #3.  Well, I got my replacement sensor and installed it last night but it didn't make a difference.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I am asking again for any suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; I did do the test someone suggested and ground the sensor wire and that didn't make a difference either but I thought I'd try a new sensor anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would greatly be apprecited.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
