&gt; I actually had never even considered using steel braided lines. But you
&gt; bring up an excellent point.

I have steel braided lines on my bus,  have had em for years now and they
seem to be holding up well, but probably time to change em.  they are
expensive for good ones and believe me your hands will take a beating.  I
stuck myself more times that I care to remember and I was wearing leather
gloves the whole time...
