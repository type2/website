Subject: Re: [T2] Increasing power


you can push a bus  on a standard heavy
&gt;setup type 1,  but not  a vanagon.

Not true: Clara built a 1641 that pushes a vanagon around. She had to modify 
the rear to get an upright in by about 3 inches, but it works and I see it 
running around here in Oly every few weeks.
