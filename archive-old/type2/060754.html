Subject: Re: 1969 Westy Turn Indicator Problem

Bob, it's scaring me that I know this, but you have a wire loose in your turn signal/dimmer switch. I believe you will find, when you remove the cover to the turn signal switch, that the solder on one of the wires has worked it's way loose and you're repositioning it with the gyrations you've described. Of course, once you remove the cover, you must be comitted to resolder it in place, since it will move even more and possibly ground on the cover...and your &quot;normal&quot; ritual will no longer work.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;4. After I go around the corner, the blinkers go off, the audible clicking stops, but the indicator in the dash stays on. The only way I can get the turn signal indicators to go off again is to turn on the headlights (if they aren't already on) and flash the highbeams. This resets the indicator.
