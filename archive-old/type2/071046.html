Gentlepersons-
                      The clouding at the edges of the windshield can be 
removed, but only with
the windshield removed. We did this on a rare/expensive windscreen with a 
hair dryer,
followed by resealing the edges. Might not be worth all the effort if a 
replacement is
readily available...As long as the glass is out, etc.
                     As to polishing out scratches, again yes, but leaves a 
distortion in the
view. Better suited to side/rear windows than windshields. An easier &quot;fix&quot; is 
the silicone
based polishes for eye glasses. It's not permanent, but does fill very minor 
scratches.
                     Hope this helps, as some states include windshield 
condition for inspec-
tion...
