Subject: Re: [T2] intermittent starting  problem

Check the connections from the starter to the ignition switch and back for
looseness. Also all grounds.

It may be that when you turn the pulley you are shaking the bus enough to
re-establish a loose connection.

It seems unlikely that you are completely shorting all power. Such a
a short would be noticeable, smellable, etc., and would drain your battery
in short order, as it would have to be there BEFORE you turned your ignition
switch, as the ignition switch does not seem to be hot -- no dash lights,
etc.

Let us know what you find out.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; degrees, the lights will come on and everything is normal.  &gt; Tristan
