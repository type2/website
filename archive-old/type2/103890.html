Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlin

FWIW, my wife's mini van had a problem somewhat similar. when you stepped on
the brakes, the radio volume would go down. Right turn signal and the dash
lights go on. right signal, etc.
    Turned out to be a bulb in the tail light was messed up. Apparently
there was a bad connection and the lead leads melted until they touched.
    I found this out 2 hours after taking it to a specialty shop at $75 an
hour. Repair bill $1.50 for bulb, $3.50 for new socket, $150 for labor.
(Sounds like the making of a credit card commercial)

I'd suggest checking all the bulbs and connections.
Later,
