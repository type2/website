i have had bus since may of 1997. have
done regular oil changes etc.  if i could
i would keep it but i'm in the market for
a motorcycle and it is not fair of me to 
sit on this when someone else can enjoy it.
i'm in carson city nevada, 30 miles south of
reno for those of you unfamiliar with this region.

thank you,
michael morin
