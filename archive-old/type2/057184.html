Subject: I'm Back

Hey all,

After much business travel, a healthy bout with pneumonia, an a week
of convalsence in Aspen, Co. I'm back in Austin, and on the list.

I have to say that there are many VWs in the Aspen area, along with
Ferrari's, Lambroghini's, Lotus's, Aston Martins, and such.  The
majority of what I saw were Vanagon Westies, and Syncro Westies, but I
did see my fair share of Bay-window busses.  

Probably in the next year or so, I will be relocating to either the
Aspen area, or Colorado Springs, so I will be adding my 79 Westy to
the mix.

We drove my wifes Isuzu Rodeo up there, as I don't think that my bus
was up for the 7000+ foot climb and 1800 mile roundtrip journey.

Since this was not a VW journey I will not bore you with any details,
only to say that if you get the opportunity to drive up the rockies
from the south to the north you would not regret it.  We stayed off
the interstates except when necessary.  I think that it made the drive
that much more pleasant.

Unfortunately, those in power here at Compaq have decided that popping
ones email from their own ISP violates a newly created policy, so I
have to use yahoo for may mail.

Enough rambling.

Cheers,

David
