&gt; I trust this isn't an utter waste of bandwidth. Which would be the
&gt; better deal:
&gt; 
&gt; #1. Private Owner, '76 Westfalia, supposedly runs great. I haven't
had a
&gt; chance to start it...but consistent maintenance doesn't appear to be
the
&gt; owner's strong point. There is heavy (not flakey) rust the length of
the
&gt; side door channel. The front has many, many spots of rust boiling
&gt; through the paint, pimply and not flakey. The left side has a 1/8''
deep
&gt; gouge that runs the length of the bus...about five feet long, plus a
&gt; handful of door dings. It also has a football-sized butt bash under
the
&gt; right taillight.
&gt; 
&gt; #2. Slimey Dealership, '75 Campmobile with what appears to be a
&gt; Riviera-style top. The body appears to be pretty darn good, though the
&gt; brand new (and putrid umber color) paint might be covering a multitude
&gt; of sins. The engine is in pieces--apparently it suffers from scored
&gt; cylinders. The previous purchaser bought it, discovered it had an oil
&gt; leak, took it to Molnar Brothers who said it was bad juju, tore the
&gt; engine apart and left him with the mess.

Well, the choice seems to be between doing body work and doing engine
work.  The type 4 engine won't be all that cheap to fix (I'd allocate
$2k to that).  The bodywork won't be cheap to fix either.  Which do
you feel more competent to tackle?

Before you buy the dealer bus, find someone who knows how to detect
Bondo and take 'em along.  I am _very_ suspicious of new paint jobs,
since they often cover up bad prep work, gaping rust holes, etc.  It'd
be terrible to buy that bus and find out that it had more rust than
the running bus whose owner is at least honest enough not to disguise
it.

In either case, talk 'em down a little.  Offer $500 and give yourself
some bargaining leeway.
