Subject: Old Bus Canvas Wanted

I have just received access to a big industrial canvas sewing machine.  In
fact 3 different sized ones including one that can sew leather 3/8&quot; thick.
What I am looking for are patterns such as the old Westy canvas that you
took off when you replaced it.  Or other items for the VW bus.  I am going
to practice by making myself a cab divider for my 72 Westie but just by
measurement and it would be nice to be able to lay out the patterns from a
old piece to see the stitchings and the folds so if you have anything that
IS ALL THERE please contact me off the list.
Anybody for a all leather Westie poptop?          ;^{)
 No I am not wanting to do everybody's PLF type orders, just wanting to
learn for myself at this point
