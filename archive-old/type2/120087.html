Subject: RE: [T2] dizzy ground repair

&gt; The constant flexing would crack solder in short order. I've heard you can
&gt; TIG weld them if you know what you're doing. You can get rebuilt dizzies for
&gt; about any VW from: http://philbingroup_dot_com/

hmm
i dont think the flexing would crack the solder. it doesnt inside speakers
and woofers especially move a lot more than the dizzy plate.
can you tig weld copper to steel? is the plate steel? the nut?

yeah i _could_ always buy a rebuilt dizzy but thats not as fun.
