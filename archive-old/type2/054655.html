I assume you are referring to the seals, not the cooler itself, that you
think are leaking  Either way, Jim is right, you must remove the fan shroud,
it must LIFT UP first, to clear the upright oil cooler.  Do it the right
way, remove the engine, and let us know what you find.

&gt; &gt; The oil cooler  on my 71 Westy is leaking. I ordered some from Rocky
Mountain
&gt; &gt; and plan to replace the old ones this weekend. My question is: Is this
&gt; &gt; something that can be done without pulling the engine? I checked the
archives
&gt; &gt; but didn't find an answer to my question. Thanks in advance for your
help
&gt;
&gt; On a 71? No way. You have to remove the fan shrouding to get to the oil
&gt; cooler, and there's not enough room to do it on a 71.
