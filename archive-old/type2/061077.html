Over a week ago I realized that I had a mechanical problem. The '72 was was
sounding off with a metallic shriek as the clutch was let out. Research into
the subject of clutches and buses led me to the conclusion that clutch was
fine but the pilot bearing was about to give up the ghost. My instinct was
to pull the engine and replace the pilot bearing: two things I had not done
before but felt that I could for $25.00 and a days work.

While waiting for payday to roll around I read a lot about clutches and
engine removal.  It became an obsession. Pull the engine or the tranny or
both. Stayed up late reading books, consulted the list(and they graciously
responded) bugged local guru, meditated, came to a number of final
decisions, and then changed my mind.

By Thanksgiving morning $200 worth of parts(but no pilot bearing) and a plan
were at hand. On Saturday, my good friend and shadetree mechanic, Chad,
would help me pull the engine and replace the release bearing, pressure
plate and friction disk. Although Chad is not a VW freak he can turn a
wrench like few others can!

Chad arrived early this morning with a floor jack and a truck full of tools.
We cleared the driveway and set up shop. It took about three hours to pull
the engine: one hour of which was wasted trying to figure out why the engine
would not pull free of the tranny. I forgot the two transmission bolts
inside the engine compartment:sophomore mistake, won't happen again. 

Chad replaced the release bearing while I pondered my engine which was
resting peacefully  in the driveway.  The pressure plate looked fine: all
springs in place and evenly laid out. Removal of the pressure plate revealed
a well worn but still usable friction plate. Then my worst fear came true.
Pilot bearing was shot. Needles came out with clutch. I pitched a fit.. 

Why didn't I insist on getting that part when I bought the clutch kit? After
all, that is what I thought I really needed. I agreed to the clutch kit
because I did not know if it had ever been replaced and figured I might as
well while the engine is out. 

I didn't trust my instincts because I didn't have the experience to back up
my fancy booklearning. The result is a bus and engine are painfully
separated during the Holiday season while I await parts and another sunny
day. 

I have learned a lot today and owe a great deal of thanks to Chad who did
the lions share of the work. 


Trust your instincts!
Love your bus!
You cannot get parts on Saturday afternoon no matter how pissed off you are
