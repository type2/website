Subject: trip report

Just got back from a few days in Uinta Mountains.
First real trip with the bus--about 300 miles.
Ran cool and swift. Climbed some steep-p-p-p-p dirt
roads and crossed some mountains passes without
problem.

The z-bed i put in worked great, even though the kids
slept in it --with me sleeping on the ground.

three problems: One high beam went out, no horn, and
the window on the drivers side got shaken loose by
vibration on back roads and fell into the door.

In other words, a great trip. Thanks to everyone who
talked me through to this point.

Next trip is long loop to California and back. Yee-haw.
