Subject: Del 40s fuel hookup

Hi, I am finishing my &quot;warmed over&quot; 1800 type 2 motor, and because I live in a
remote place where this application is not common, I would like to know, where
the 2 fuel &quot;nipples&quot; on the Del 40s attach to the fuel system, and where the
&quot;base plate&quot; attachments go to since I am running an 009 &quot;dizzy&quot;.  If any one
has a complete &quot;pix&quot;, of the whole system installed in a type 2 , that would
be great, or &quot;sage&quot; advice from past &quot;doers&quot;.  Thanks
