&gt;by doing all my own fixing and rescuing parts from wrecks,

Hey, that isn't what this argument is about! Of course it's great to do 
your own work and rescue parts from wrecks! Bugged the heck out of me 
when I had to have someone else do some welding for me.

My FI system is a multi-year monstrosity. So's the engine, the dizzy, 
blah, blah, blah.

I tried three times on this list to figure out how to build an EGR filter
from scratch (since it cannot contain more than $3 of materials) and
couldn't get a definitive answer as to what precisely it does and what is
inside of it. Only very begrudgingly did I shell out $115 for that part,
and i waited as long as I could. 

But I don't think that a visual inspection of a 25-year old brake hose is 
adequate, and I am darned sure not going to try to make a new one out of 
McDonalds straws and coathanger wire. Replace them, separate yourselves 
from what is, after all, only money.
