&gt; Before you do this, consider that it is a sure-fire way to damage the
&gt; front sheet metal.  Other drivers think that the tire is a nice soft
&gt; bumper and act accordingly.  Unfortunately, the metal underneath is even
&gt; softer than the tire and will get pushed in.

no but when the tractor trailer whacked the front it kept him far enough
away that I bounced into the next lane, sure bent the front skin some, but
he hit me hard enough to push in the front door frame on the passenger
side enough that it hasn't worked right since. but didn't break the
windshield or even the headlight.

state trooper said I was one lucky B**T**d

&gt; When I bought my bus, the previous owner threw in a brand new tire mount
&gt; that he never got time to install.  Thank goodness for small favors!
&gt; 
&gt; In the Idiot Book, Muir says that the spare in front is good crash
&gt; protection.  Muir obviously didn't take physics.
