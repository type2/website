Just my 2 cents here....

I gotta agree.

I've been wanting to get rid of my pop-top (not the bus, just the top) for
quite a while now. I've been looking for the past year for &quot;something
better&quot;... like a high-top or a riviera pop-top. something that would be
functional AND made for that model.

First of all, you need to know that my pop-top is in horrible shape. The
canvas is excellent, but the shell has a huge crack going down the
centerline and is only getting bigger. the hinge supports up front can only
be described as &quot;not good&quot;

Anyway, getting to the point, yesterday I was perusing my favorite salvage
yard and found a '74 Riviera pop-top conversion. The engine had been
stripped out, the body was in ok condition, pilot area was gone, but all of
the camper stuff was there and in very good shape.

I pulled off the pop-top. everything was there, the wood was in great shape
not rotted, the vinyl was not torn, the zippers worked perfect, only one
screen was punched out.

I'll be able to do this conversion easily as no structural changes need to
be made. I'd recommend this type of change as no cutting/welding needs to be
done, it's an original accessory, and it fairly easily done (except for it
being dog-gone heavy)

Oh, if anyone in the San Francisco bay area is interested in the
cabinet/sink (water tank &amp; AC hook-ups) or the rear bench (i think it's a
&quot;z&quot; bed) it's at &quot;AC Auto Wreckers&quot; at 220 Rankin Street, at Evans in San
Francisco.

&gt; Ok, this may have long since been discussed but I am adding my point of
&gt; view.
&gt; If you go for structural integrity its ok. Look at how many times the VW
&gt; aftermarket, read dealers, sundial etc. did it. Its ok. Follow the same
&gt; path of integrating the top in that others did.
&gt; Look, it is a 73, not a early bus that should be cared for. By this time
&gt; (73) so many aftermarket people were on the bandwagen it doesnt make any
&gt; difference. Ok, you might flame me, but think about all the bugs made in
&gt; the fifties that got aftermarket items. These are now considered hot
&gt; items. They are not pure VW, they were EMPI et all, Judson
&gt; Superchargers, etc. Now is the time to change a few (not all) late model
&gt; busses with the latest and the best you can afford.
&gt; What I am saying is, do not use cheap parts, go for something that
&gt; belongs on the bus, use care and do it right. Some years from now when
&gt; the 73 is like the 63 of our era it will stand out and make sense. Try
&gt; and find the correct pieces, like a 73 should have, and I think that
&gt; will be OK.
