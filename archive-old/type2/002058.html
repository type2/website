Greetings..

Ok...

I haven't had any luck at all diagnosing the cause for the high oil temps
(up to 240 in 15 minutes of highway driving and higher unless I drop down to
50 or so) I've had in my 1600 dp (71 bus)...  The only thing I haven't
checked yet is the oil cooler itself.  I'm trying to decide if it's worth it
to pull the engine and have a look at the cooler or not.  I probably will
try to do so this week...  When I do, what types of things should I be
looking for?  I'm thinking things like dents or crimps in the cooler, as
well as blockages at the entrances...

I guess I don't have any way of knowing whether or not oil is able to flow
through and cool through this oil cooler...  I could shuck out the $80 for a
new one, but I'd like to be sure that's the problem.. I have air passing
over the cylinder (flaps open), and both the pressure relief valve and
pressure control valve don't appear to be stuck.  I've flushed the engine
once with absolutely no difference in operating temps.

Are there any other places to look besides the oil cooler?

Secondly, the stalling problem has returned anew... The majority of times
(which makes this all the more puzzling) that I come to a stop (coasting at
idle), I will stall.... Sometimes, the engine seems to &quot;catch&quot; itself and
just as it's about to die, pick up rpms and return to a normal idle.  This
happens regardless of brake pressure or lack of braking altogether.  It's
almost like an inertial stall, where the steeper the grade that I stop on,
the greater the chances of stalling.  I've found no vacuum leaks, and timing
(dual vacuum advance dizzy), dwell, etc. are right on.

Can gasoline flow into the carb (34pict3) throat and stall an engine purely
through inertia, or does it only have to be pumped?  I've checked my float
twice and it seems to be fine (no gas inside) and there isn't a smell of
gasoline around the carb to indicate flooding...

Any thoughts?

Otherwise, I am going to break down (and yes, it hurts:() and take Putty to
a mechanic...  I've been to Carl's VW at 103rd and Meridian N and will never
go back.  I'm also a little skeptical of University VW at 55th and 35th NE,
although I've never actually taken my car there...

I'd really like someone who'll listen to the problems CAREFULLY, and then
explain the solutions to me.  If these two criteria are met, cost is not an
option, as the education will be worth it's weight in gold...

Any ideas?

Cheers and Happy Mondays to the lot of you...

Tom
Seattle
