&gt; &gt;We vacationed in Mexico recently.  We flew into Cancun, and went immediately
&gt; &gt;to Isla Mujeres.  We then went to Cozumel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
&gt; &gt;bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.  
&gt; 
&gt; Even in that high temp environment, tropical not temperate, must not be too
&gt; many spec (Mexican specs and tolerances and metalurgy even) air cooled
&gt; motors burning up from overheating. I would guess that the only ones
&gt; destroyed from excess heat are the ones with aftermarket cooler setups or
&gt; other out of spec running.

Well, overheating isn't much of a problem in this region.  The temperatures, which may be uncomfortable for humans (90F, 90% humidity) 
aren't all that bad for aircooled engines.  Humid air absorbs heat from hot engines better than dry desert air.  (OTOH, for engines that are 
cooled by evaporation, such as our own bodies, dry air is better.)  Climbing hills isn't much of an issue, as the highest hill on the entire 
Yucatan Peninsula is about 200 feet high.  All in all, it's a benign environment for aircooled engines.  The same is not true for rust.  The 
proximity of the sea, warm temperatures, and daily downpours aren't good for sheet metal.
