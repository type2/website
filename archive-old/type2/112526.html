Subject: Bizarre braking

Last fall I did the complete brake job on my '70 bus, but starting in the winter I had some braking problems.  Occasionally, the bus would pull violently to the left when I braked.  OK, I thought, a leaking cylinder.  I pulled the front wheels, but everything looked dry and tight.   After I put it all back together, the brakes worked fine for awhile, but soon, the same thing started to happen.  Plus, I lost some brake fluid, though I could not find any leak, but then the fluid stayed level for a long time.  The braking continues to act up intermittently.   I'm at wits end.  Any thoughts?

Thanks.
Jerry
