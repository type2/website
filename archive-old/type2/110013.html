Subject: Re: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

George--

The problem wit running 60 mph during the day is, you can actually see
passing motorists flipping you off---I'd rather not know--:&gt;)

I don't know about you guys out west--but here in the Windy--60 is like
having a boat anchor tied to your tail end---

And I'll go one step farther---travel anywhere on the
interstate's--going any direction--north to Wisconsin, south to
Kentucky, east especially to Indiana or west to Iowa---forget 60--your a
detriment to traffic--and are going to be getting a bunch of obscene
gestures from flying fools--and this does include 18 wheeler's or
straight trucks--no difference.

Your best bet is to stay off the major interstate's if your going to
crawl along---beddy beddy dangerous--and bad for your health--as well as
your Bus's--

So in essence, I agree with Chris--

Later,

Terry

And that folks is what worries me the most about running 55 mph on
interstates where much of the traffic is running closer to 80 mph. Folks
driving too fast and not paying attention (the other guys - not the VW
drivers). 
Y'know, I've driven I-5 and don't find that the average is anywhere near 
80. Truck speed limit is 55 and most trucks are running 60-62 or so.
Autos run 65-75. 
I run around 60 so I fit in pretty well. Yes there is the odd
speedburner who is running 80, but that isn't the flow speed. 
My understanding is that this accident took place at night. One place
that our buses are definitely behind the times is in the area of
taillights. That's why I really don't like to run at night with the bus
if I can avoid it. In the daytime it is pretty hard to ignore a bus.
