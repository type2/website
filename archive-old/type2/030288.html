&gt; &gt; I do not trust the filed &quot;v's&quot; on my pulley and the paint marks are gone.
&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me how I'd go about finding TDC assuming the pulley has
&gt; NO
&gt; &gt; markings on it whatsoever.  I want to find tdc and file a notch at zero,
&gt; &gt; then file another at 7.5btdc.
&gt; 
&gt; Remove either valve cover. Turn the engine in the direction of rotation.
&gt; Make SURE it is in the direction of rotation! Watch the rocker arms move on
&gt; the forward cylinder of either side. As you turn the engine you will see the
&gt; exhaust open [front rocker], exhaust close, intake immediately open, intake
&gt; close, then for a long time neither move. Keep turning til the exhaust opens
&gt; again. Just as it closes, STOP. At this point the intake should just start
&gt; to move. You want both rocker arms to be at a neutral point. Now go look at
&gt; you timing mark. That is zero, top dead center.

This gets you +/- about 10 degrees or so.  To find the real TDC, you take
the plug out of the #1 or #3 cylinder and stick a screwdriver into the
hole.  As you turn the engine, the screwdriver will move to indicate the
piston position.  If you have a dial indicator you can use that, but the
screwdrive method is just as good to find TDC.
