Subject: Re: Shop Moving Sale -- CAUTION!

Sibling Listees:

Earlier today I forwarded a list of items for sale sent to me by Kevin
Murray here in FL.

Ken Hooper politely chastised me for doing so, as Kevin is persona non
grata on the type2 list due to some bad dealings in the past, where
people didn't get what they expected.  The F word was used.  (I'm giving
you a milder version of Ken's assessment. :-)

Please caveat emptor, folks.  When dealing with uncertainties and
imperfect histories, it may be best to do business in person.

I value my relationships and interactions with list members very highly
and would deeply regret feeding anyone bad info.  My sincere apologies.

Hope to see some of you at the Dade City (98!) show.

Mea culpa,
Credulous Joe

PS: Sorry for all the Latin.
