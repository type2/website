Subject: Virginia/DC busses

I received a request (from someone not on the list) for information about bus-related sightseeing in the DC area for an international visitor.  If anyone knows of such attractions, or is in the area and would like to show their bus to a fellow enthusiast please e-mail me privately and I will put you in touch with them.

Thanks,
	-David
