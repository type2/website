i got one of the problem's fixed, (the engine shutting off when put into
reverse)...i guess the PO didnt know where that wire went and since there was
a break in it it didnt matter...now it is in the right sopt on the coil and
the break lights work again!   whew- thats solved-

still no clue on the lights not coming on....now the wiper's dont work
either....
took a look under the dash to check it out and couldnt find any broke or bad
connections everything 'seems' allright to me...just seems to get worse as the
days go by. i have all the manuals that i could ever need, got out the wiring
diagram, but i could not comprehend with all the wires under there :-)that
sure is a mess....
any other ideas? i have no clue where a fault could be located....as i said i
havent done anything under the dash with any wires(and it has been
stationary), so i cant see why it whould just all of a sudden screw up on me


thanks for your help on my reverse gear problem 

Adam
