Subject: how do pidsits sit?

I've carefully rebuilt the Folly's left carb... the 34 Pidsit 2/3.   Now...
should there be a fairly thick gasket between the bottom of the carbs and
the top of the mainifold.? One seems to be attached to the tight hand carb
&lt;FIF&gt;.

Also... just out of interest...  The Folly was running... although not real
well...  and when I removed the carbs for rebuild the other day. The right
hand carb seemed to be both wet with gas and carboned in the throat.  Any
thoughts on this?

A rebuilding question... I've replaced the automatic choke as per the
bently... I screwed this up previously... is there a way to test before
reinstallation?

One more.... there are four electrical connections on the left hand carb...
I want to make up a new wire for this.  Can I make an octopus and have four
wires soldered into the one wire that goes to the coil???

Please and thanks to all who can help!!!

Barry...
