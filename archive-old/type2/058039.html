Hi Volks!

Sunshine rides again! Last night around 2:00 a.m. the silence around Driftwood was shattered by the sound of a 1600dp VW engine being fired up after a fresh rebuild...two months, less a couple of days after its near-fatal meltdown on the high plains of west Texas.  A malfunctioning generator light had allowed a thrown belt to go undetected for way too long in the 104 degree heat - I didn't know until I smelled hot oil, then it was too late. The engine smoked for almost two hours after I turned it off, and had lost all compression. 
Turns out the heads had taken most of the damage. I replaced the heads, installed new valves, seals, and rings and bolted that puppy back together. Now she runs as good or better than ever. Drove it to work this morning - 40 miles - without the slightest problem. It looks like the bus will make it to the Kerrville Folk Festival this weekend after all.

Time will tell if the ongoing problem I've had with the generator eating pulleys is fixed...I have replaced the generator, fan, stand, and pulley; also checked alignment of the pulleys VERY carefully. Keep your fingers crossed, and thanks again to everyone who offered advice/suggestions about the problem.

Keep on Bussin'
