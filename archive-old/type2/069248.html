I have always used a 1&quot; plastic (nylon??) putty knife to avoid paint
scratches. Cuting a slot in it might very well help.  One idea I have had
but not tried was to use a kitchen spatula.  The slot idea comes natural
to this if you cut the front of it back to the precast slots in many of
them and then sand a bevel back onto the front edge.
