&gt;It would only leak at more then 1/2 full, and then it
&gt;looked like the leaks were from the edge seem cause that where the gas
&gt;leaked down too.

this is exactly what is going  on with mine.........But good news the
mech said alll the eng. needs is a good flush and brakes and a new tank.
and a new windshield and a new passanger side window and side view
mirrors and ..............so YEAHHHH
I'm gonna let him do it this time just because he's got it and I got the
money to let him do it ..(I cashed in some stock to get the bus running)
He said it would still cost _at_ 2000.00  or more if any thing funky
happens with the tank...He's having trouble finding a tank, I tried to
tell him about the wonderful connections I've made over the internet and
he put it down as some sort of dumb kid shit.... so what ever I will
find out how much one costs from the bus boys or depot or rocky mountain
today and drop off thier number with my deposit.


Thank you for inpiring me today, You know that is whats great about the
internet. Meeting people from  all over, All reaching out to  each other
for the better purpose(well, alot of people try)
I think its great to have met you and thanks again.

If you feel like a cruise I live in North Eastern  Maryland  in a town
called Charlestown  there is a map place on the www somewhere.....(; (;
