Maybe i'm asking fot it or showing my ignorance, but aren't most &quot;type 4, 2 litre engines&quot; hyd lift? How is it &quot;obviously...solid lift...&quot; could be only the U.S. If i'm just ignorant of this, you can hit me in the head with one of these solid lifters. ;]

&gt;I set them all to 0.006&quot; the first time.  This time (after 2500 miles) they
&gt;were all around 0.008&quot;.  What I would like to know is, is this a normal wear
&gt;rate?  (BTW this is a type 4, 2 litre engine, obviously with solid lifters.)
&gt;I could not find this information in any of the books I have or in the
&gt;archives, only references to tight valves.  Should I be relaxing or
&gt;worrying?
