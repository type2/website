Hello All

I have recently acquired good BN2 heater.  Appears complete and I  have
gotten the fan to spin nicely.  I have done digging on the internet and
have seen the BN4, and BA4 heater manuals on line.  I think this one
came out of a beetle.  Does anyone know if the manual exists anywhere
for this heater?  It is small and I'm hoping to put in the my bus.

Thanks
Brent
