For the same price you could buy 2 gallons of acid and use only a fraction of it and have lots of acid left over for other projects.

Popular acids strength scale, highest to lowest:

HCl Hydrocloric (swimming pool pH reducer) better for cleaning, derusting
H2SO4 Sulfuric (wet batteries)
CH3COOH Acetic (vinegar)
H3PO4 Phosphoric (colas) better for etching already clean metal
