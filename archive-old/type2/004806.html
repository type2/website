Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Hiccups



&gt; Here's the sitch: 71, everything standard. 'Mona diesels badly when I shut
&gt; her down. She runs great, really great, aside from that. My question; pretend
&gt; the carb is not suspect. What else could be causing this? I will be changing
&gt; the points Sunday but wanted some of your golden input first!

You cannot pretend the carb is not the suspect......
It is the problem. Your idle speed is too high.

The term 'dieseling' comes from a diesel engine. A diesel engine only uses
compression as an ignition system. No points, no distributor, no coil.
