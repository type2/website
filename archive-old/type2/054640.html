On 7/8/00 3:42 PM, vw_at_forceesc_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm having a heck of a 
&gt;time finding someone who will insure me for my 79 Westfalia. I have 
&gt;given them terms like type II, Westfalia, Campmobile, camper, but 
&gt;they are unable to insure it. Can anyone tell me who they are insured 
&gt;with?
&gt;

     My ins. co. database didn't go too far back, so I had to call mine a 
Vanagon/Eurovan. Makes me feel dirty.

;-)
