OK...here is my opinion....

I'm not condoning drug use....or condemning it...but this is it.

The internet is a place of astronomical value, many could not live without
it.....this also means free speach.....yes..there are/is books, resourceful
people, manuals, guides, services, pornography, products, drugs, email, hate
groups, churches, free things, games, etc on the internet....you name it,
&quot;it&quot; has it.  This comes along with free speech.  The internet is one of the
last places where one can come to exercise their rights, and have an
enjoyable time.  One can say what they want, when they want.  Do you really
want the &quot;thought nazis&quot; coming after you for saying that marijuana is &quot;good&quot;
or &quot;bad&quot; and fining you or suing you?  NO!  Nobody wants to be bothered about
anything.  One must understand that there are many stereotypes throughout the
world that will be erased by nothing.  This includes Volkswagen busses.
There are numerous scholars, government officials, hippies, drug users
(notice there IS a difference), stiff collars, teenagers, veterans, teachers,
weird people that own record stores..hehe (your not alone), computer dorks
(me included), etc that own busses.  A vast amount of people associate busses
with things such as drug use, Phish, The Grateful Dead, and touring.  This is
solely because these busses were first actually noticed by people when they
saw them traveling the country in caravans to see the Dead, go camping, live
in, etc...  Many of these people did do various drugs.  There is/is not
anything wrong with this.  People have a choice to do what they like, when
they like.  There is nothing that &quot;you&quot; can do to stop &quot;them&quot;.  In fact, the
guy that I am buying my bus from followed the Dead for a long time, he also
followed Phish, got pulled over and his bus searched (they found numerous
pipes and a bag of marijuana...they destroyed 3 out of the 4 pipes...the cops
took 1 pipe and the bag of marijuana, and gave them no fine....law
enforcement at its best huh smart ass?)

So really here I am saying that unless you want a charter of rules and
regulations on what words you can and can't use (FCC with their 7-&quot;dirty&quot;
words) then just shut up and deal with it..._dot_delete the message....find a
happy place, do whatever it is you do....  Don't get mad over some little
thing that you can do absolutely nothing about....after all...I understand
this is &quot;free fridays&quot; where we can talk about whatever we feel like.

Reply to the list and let everyone know what you feel....this is my topic for
&quot;free fridays&quot;

                                        !FREE SPEECH!

And to Steve and the admin.....I'm sorry for doing this but it must be
done....if you want to kick me off....go right ahead...but at least let me
read the mails that respond to this....it is very important....I value this
list immensly because of all the brilliant people, and all of the useful
information that passes through here that I couldn't do without. Keep in mind
my words.

sense of tradition.
