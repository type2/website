Hi Dave,
    Have you checked McMaster Carr? http://www.mcmaster_dot_com/ Someone from 
this list turned me on to them a while back as a source for my '73 poptop 
gasket      (piece that runs around the front and sides). They carry a 
dizzying array of shapes. 
                                        Good Luck, Rob
