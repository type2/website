Subject: Re: [T2] EGR light on

Hello,

As far as I understand it, the EGR light is turned on
and off by a little &quot;box&quot; connected to yourspeedo
cable. As far as I understand, look under your dash
and there should be alittle switch on it that resets
it. The light comes on after so many miles. It is just
a reminder to check your EGR settup and make sure that
is still running properly. This used to involve taking
it in to the dealership where they would inspect and
probably replace your EGR filter, test it and reset
the button under the dash. This is all what I
understand and have been told. If anyone can add to,
correct any part of or completely discount what I
typed, please do so. I am glad to learn everything I
can. I have never had to do this myself. Good luck!

&gt; So in the old adage of don't fix it if it ain't
&gt; broke, how do I turn the
&gt; light off without killing y new found power?
