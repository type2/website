Subject: Re: [T2] Question for All the Water Cooled Converts

 &gt;&gt;&gt;how come people are looking for alternative water cooled motor&lt;&lt;&lt;

Why would anyone want a Wasser engine in a pre-79 bus? Why the heck! A 
well tune aircooled as better cooling capacity in traffic, idle and 
equal  (if not better) at freeway speed!!! And that without the hassle 
of the well know Vanagon (or any engine in the back /rad in front van) 
cooling problemessssss

I've own/owned Vanagon's and now my 73, since i now have normal power!!!!!
http://www_dot_desert2002_dot_com/heads.htm (before i had normal power and was 
blaming the Carbs!!!)

Power with my 1.75L (oversize) is now about equal to our 84 1.9L and 
even the 2.1L, i don't think i would never go back to any Water-cooled 
VW van/bus, and beleive me i know Vanagon by heart! 
http://www3.sympatico_dot_ca/huotx/engine1.htm

My 73 now run's at 340F at each head at 55-65mph, engine oil is at 
200F-220F (outside temp 95F). At idle or slow driving, heads temps are 
around 250-300F. The Vanagon, even with the Subaru engine, (friend of 
mine) is always having a hard time at idle or stuck in traffic due to 
the very high coolant quantity and somewhat poor cooling system at low 
speed/traffic.

I also feel a lot safer when my girlfriend is taking off with the 73 for 
the weekend with her friends than our late 87.

Am amaze by the very eficient air-cool cooling performance and 
mechanical simplicity of our bus's.

Am building a 2.0L engine right now that should produce a clean and safe 
90-95HP, carburated with some nice Dell, i will be my dream VW Bus or Van.

I only wish i had that double bed up there, that is the ONLY thing i 
miss from the Vanagon.

Cheers, Ben
