Subject: Re: TYPE IV into a 68-71 bus ? (anyone ever done this)

Boy, you're looking for the impossible, I think. Even putting a '81
Type IV into a '73 Type IV is a major hassle with the tin. This time
around, I'm getting a much better fit by using the front piece from the
'73, and then taking the two '73 left and right top covers and using
them for a pattern to cut the excess from the '81 tin with tin snips,
but the rear tin is  pretty hopeless with out a lot of cutting and
welding. 
     And *that* looks a lot easier than changing the body itself -- but
it's been awhile since I've looked at my '68 van (it's in N. Minn.) so I
can't really remember how different it is from the '73. Pretty different
tho.
