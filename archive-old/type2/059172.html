Subject: '77-'78 help

I am looking at a package deal of 2 busses. a somewhat cancerous '77
running with a 2.0l in it and a non-rusty '78 with a big empty space where
the motor used to be.  I want to make one nice bus out of them.  Were there
any major structural changes between these 2 model years that would make
this especially difficult?  I figure that if the engine doesn't bolt up to
the '78 tranny, I can just swap the whole engine tranny from the '77 to the
'78.  Is this reasonable?  Anything else I might need to know.  My previous
busses were '71 and '68, so this pancake motor is new to me.  Thanks in
advance.
Russell
