Subject: Re: [T2] tie rods

&gt; The hard part is getting the length of the rod right so your toe-in is
&gt; approximately the same as before.
&gt;


Because I installed mine due to worn joints, I was able to compare them out
of the bus and get an exact length. When I went in for an alignment
afterwards, it was darn near perfect.

I recommend an alignment after installation since you had a bent one.
