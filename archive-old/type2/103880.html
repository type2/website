Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlin

Sounds like the electrical portion of the ignition
switch has taken a break, get out your Bently book and
read up on how to replace the switch, it's not a easy
task but it can be done. One of my buses has got the
same problem. Bus depot should have the part. Phil
