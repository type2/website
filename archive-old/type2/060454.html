Subject: spark plug recomendation?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Howdy,
After overhauling my 1600 upright engine in my '79 Westfalia, I got new
Bosch spark plugs for it.  Well, for the first ~50 miles my carb was running
a little rich and so the plugs got a little carbon on them.  Now they are
failing out.  First in #2 cylinder (it was missing out), I swapped plugs
with #1 and then #2 fired and #1 missed.  So I got a new plug for #1 and now
#2 is missing.  Help.  What plugs seem to work well for aircooleds?  Does
anyone have any advice here?

Also, does anyone know if there is a difference in engine compartments
between a type2 bus and a pancake engine bus?  I know a type2 will fit where
the pancake was but is the hole back there any different?  My Owners Manual
says my '79 bus is a type2 and I'm looking for the missing cooling tin and
don't know if I should get type2 tin or the type2 in a type4 conversion tin.

Everybody seems to sign off with, Cheers,
Christopher
1979 Westfalia w/ '67 T2 engine
