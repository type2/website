Subject: Re: [T2] Re; 81 slider window

Roger that. definately are different windows.  That is what struck me as 
funny.  When i got home i did some further checking and i get the same 
single number in three systems.  The part number in one system gives a 
description.  It is the solid one piece glass and I have only seen this 
glass on one vanagon, and it was a commercial configuration.  I check my 
ETKA and  I find all the windows.  even  a  part breakdown that shows a 
solid frame with no screws anywhere.  models  253 and 255 which puts 
those windows in use from 80 model year  through 85 model year.  I think 
the other systems are  reflecting what is  available as replacement  in 
their systems.   Not nice  of them  to play with my feeble mind  like 
that.

&gt; No way no how can they be the same number.
&gt; There are 4 different Vanagon sliding windows.
&gt; The bus one has the latch handle at the corner of the glass. There is a 
&gt; left
&gt; and a right. The sliding window is at the front on each side.
&gt; The Westy one has the latch handle 14 1/2&quot; back from the corner of the 
&gt; glass,
&gt; so you can have the screen installed and open the window. There is a 
&gt; left and
&gt; a right.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; reassembly.  just noticed that the sliding door window and the kitchen
&gt;&gt; side window are the same part number.
