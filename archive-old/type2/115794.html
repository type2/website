&gt; Hi I'm a newbie to the list, but it's great to be here.  My 82 vanagon has 2
&gt; broken rocker arm studs and I am having difficulty finding new ones.  Are the
&gt; studs the same as on older engines.  Any insight would be great.

Late bay bus heads are the same studs as aircooled vanagon. I think all type
IV bus heads use the same rocker studs, but I am not positive.

Try fat performance for new ones, but they are not stock, they are 8mm on
top, stock is 7mm.

A rebuilder like rimco could probably supply good used stock ones, as they
take in many core heads.
