Subject: RE: Rocker Arm Studs

I feel sorry for you.  I recently tried to replace some exhaust studs and
two of them cracked off flush with the head.  I tried to drill them out but
the drill bit snapped off inside the stud.  I then drilled around the stud
in the hopes to use a case saver type insert.  I finally gave up trying to
work on it with the motor still in the car and yanked the motor.  When I
pulled off the heads, THEY WERE CRACKED!!!!  All that work for nothing.  If
nothing else, I am learning a new level of patience.  $200 bucks down the
drain for new heads : (

Does anyone know where I can get a set (8) of Rocker Arm Studs for my 82
Vanagon?  The previous owner seemed to have a real talent for $#_at_&amp;*!_at_ things
up and they are all striped, it was a royal pain getting the 4 out I have
managed to free so far, and I still have the other side to do.

Thanks,
Nate
