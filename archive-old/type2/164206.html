Subject: weber 34 ICT parts needed

Hi,
I have a pair of 34 ICT's on my bus and one of them has started to weep
gas around the throttle shaft. According to the parts digram I
downloaded off the net, ( http://www.racetep_dot_com/weber/34_ICT.pdf), it
looks like I need a pair of shaft seals - part 26 - (part # 41575.010)
but it looks like they don't come in a rebuild kit
(http://www.cip1_dot_ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC%2DC10%2D5471).
Can anyone confirm whether or not they come in a kit? Does anyone else
have experience with this repair? Is this what I need to do or do I need
to rebush the throttle shaft like the old solex carbs I use to have?
Where did you get parts? 
 
thanks,
Rob
