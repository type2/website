To clarify...

Our '68 Westy did NOT come with a locking engine lid.  I acquired one from
the local VW dealer and installed it on the '68.  The lid latch lock
obviously used a different key from the '68's doors/ignition.

When we bought our '70 Westy I switched the engine lid locking latch over
from the '68.

Then we sold the '68 with [Horrors!!!] a '1970 non-locking engine lid latch.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Didn't Fred say that he carried his engine lid latch from vehicle to
vehicle... so when he moved it to his new VW,,, it had a key that was
different from the rest of the door locks,,????  &lt;&lt;
