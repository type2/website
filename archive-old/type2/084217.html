Subject: Oil pump question

Considering replacing the oil pump in my 75 2000cc. Oil pressure is just
not right and the pump is the only thing that wasn't replaced during the
rebuild. So I ask once again for advice before I proceed.

1. Has anyone used any of the aftermarket oil pumps on the pancake
engine? Results good/bad? Longevity? Currently looking into CB
Performance but looking for suggestions.

2. Is it possible to change the pump without pulling the engine?
Eyeballing says if I remove the tin on the back of the engine I should
be able to remove the alternator, fan and housing to access the pump.

Thanks again,
Tom
