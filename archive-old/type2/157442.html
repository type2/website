&gt; I'm putting a new door on my 78 bus.  I have never
&gt; used the sliding door
&gt; vent window in all the time I've owned the bus. 
&gt; would prefer to put a
&gt; solid piece of glass there rather than the current
&gt; design.  I have a
&gt; slider but it looks like it goes in backwards with
&gt; the latch on the
&gt; outside.  that can't be right.
What am I missing here? You have the opening as a
source for a pattern (less the gasket thickness plus a
bit - which an experienced glassman will know how
much) and you also have a slider assembly which has an
outside shape precisely the same as the glass you
want. With a slight bit of ingenuity, you can trace
either, or both. Cut a piece of rigid cardboard to fit
over the protrusion of the aluminum extrusion holding
the glass panes currently such that you can get the
cardboard snug against the outside lip that fits into
the gasket. Now draw your pattern and cut it, making a
negative pattern which can then be used to make a
positive pattern. Simple. -BaH (I must be missing
something. It's too easy.)

&gt; does anyone in the Mid Atlantic area (I'm in
&gt; Baltimore) have solid piece
&gt; of sliding door glass. or even anywhere in the
&gt; country can you just trace
&gt; the glass size onto a piece of brown paper I can
&gt; take to the local glass
&gt; place and get a piece of tempered glass custom cut. 
&gt; or does anyone have a
&gt; slider in your bus and know how they go in, or even
&gt; better yet some
&gt; photos.  I have new rubber personally I would prefer
&gt; the slider on the
&gt; drivers side middle window with a solid piece in the
&gt; door.
