Subject: Re: [T2] About the single Weber! My conclusion...

&gt; I couldn't believe how sooth running was the Weber (forget about the  icing,
&gt; don't spoil my happiness for now), very stable idle, EXTRREMELY  good
&gt; acceleration, low, medium and top end. Head temp still at 350F  steady at
&gt; 60mph, oil 210F. That bus is screaming for a 5th gear. I truly  cannot
&gt; belive the power I have, this thing is pushing more than my  Vanagon 2.1L.
&gt; (It's only a 1700cc.... Oversize!)

I've had the Weber Progressive on my '74 1.7l since I first got it. The only
problems I've had that I can directly relate to the carb is that it won't hold
idle when it's excessively humid out (with in Chattanooga, TN) is most of the
time. I'm in the process of adding a heat riser to alleviate the problem. I
bought a Sprint DFAV air filter housing from a place online ($30 including
shipping) and I'm going to run a heat tube from one of the runs that normally
go to the booster fan to the air filter. I don't have the heat hooked up, so I
might as well use that dry, warm air for something.

When you consider that a brand new Weber Progressive kit for the Type IV
engine costs $299, including the manifold. It really is a good deal. Sure, you
can get better mileage and emissions from fuel injection, but I can buy two
spare kits for what it costs to get a marginal fuel injection working.

I also get decent gas mileage (I've actually gotten up to 24mpg, but only on
trips under the right conditions) and I cruise the interstates at 75 mph.

I'm probably going to replace my Weber with a new one soon. The linkage has
gotten sloppy over the years and the choke is shot (I have it disconnected).
