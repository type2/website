Subject: Metal wall behind front seats

Hi all,
A have had 2 friends with '76 busses and both busses had metal walls  
behind the front seats.

You can see an example of them at the following link:

My 79 does not have these.
Reading through the &quot;Model and Year Variations&quot; document in the  
type2_dot_com library I see that these were removed in model year 1977.   
I assume this was to allow the seats to recline.

I think the walls are great.
Between the wall and the seat is a great place to stash stuff; fire  
extinguishers, maps, junkmail, and random bits of fluff and lint.
When sitting on the floor facing backwards, those walls provide a  
mighty nice back rest.

My question is this:  Were those metal walls removable?  If they are  
removable, is it possible to fit them to a post '77 bus?

Thanks a lot,
Zack
