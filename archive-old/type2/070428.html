Subject: BN4 Heater Specs

&gt;&gt;&gt;output is, and maybe the CFM if it says.  (I posted all the specs. for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Carver unit because I thought other people might be contemplating a purchase,
&gt;&gt;&gt;too, and it might save them postage or a long distance call, but basically
&gt;&gt;&gt;all that I'm interested in is BTUs/KW and CFM.)

Pat,

Here are the specs for both early and late BN4 models.  I don't know how to
convert the kcal/hour to BTUs for the earlier model (and I'm too lazy to
look it up!), but here's the raw data from the manual:

Early model 12v BN4 (71-earlier bus):
Heat variable from 1080-4000 kcal/hour
Fuel consumption  0.2-0.65 liters/hour
Operating range  10-14V
Nominal voltage  12V
Current Draw  50 watts
[didn't find mention of CFM]


Late model 12v BN4 (72-74? bus):

Heating capacity from 4,000-16,000 BTU
Hours/Gallon of fuel: U.S. 6-16.5
                      IMP  7-18
Power consumption  50 watts
[again, didn't find CFM mentioned]


Good luck finding the right heater for you.  BTW, Ark Mirvis is a bit on the
pricey side (I'd describe him as the Gene Berg of gas heaters).  At one swap
meet he quoted a price of $75 for a piece of plastic ductwork--sure Ark,
lemme just break open my piggy bank!  At the last meet I saw him pushing
some new Stewart Warner box-shaped models that he must've bought alot of--I
forgot how much he was asking.  Despite this, he's a very knowledgeable guy
about gas heaters (factory trained service blah blah blah).  My first
encounter with him was over the phone.   He wouldn't sell me a fan for my
blower motor [I melted the original one before I acquired the manual with
proper tuneup specs!] because he said the fan/motor are a balanced set at
the factory.  He did offer to sell me a complete motor assembly for $1??.  I
ended up buying a new fan from JB Heaters and my heater's been running fine
for two years now.  

I'd guess I'd trust a heater Ark built just like I'd have faith in a Berg
motor--I just don't have the budget for it so I prefer to learn the process,
look for the best prices on parts and do it myself.
