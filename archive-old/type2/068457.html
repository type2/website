&gt;If you remember a recent thread I started concerning how to test

&gt;ignition systen sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
&gt;When it doesn't, I get no spark from the coil.
&gt;When it does work, everything seems OK.
&gt;
&gt;I went back to the Benltey and ran the diagnostics and test on the
&gt;coil resistance (OK), checked the Hall Control Unit (OK) and the Hall
&gt;Generator (OK).  Still the problem exists.

I don't know anything about Hall ignitions (what are they?), but something
that happened on my split-screen panel just yesterday may be instructive.

I had exactly the same symptoms: occasional missing/cutting out. This
happened to me once before and it culminated in the coil cooking itself
completely, so I just assumed it was the coil again and bought a new one.
Well, fitting it didn't solve the problem.

A careful inspection of my ignition system showed that the power cable to
the coil had been rubbing against a metal tab holding the wiring to the fan
housing, causing a tiny hole in the insulation. Every now and then this
would cause a short, resulting in the intermittent hesitation/cutting out.
A twist of insulating tape and some minor rerouting of wiring and the
problem's solved.

Might your hassle have a similar cause?
