Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix [Was: Hello Jay]

[...]

Saw a blurb about a new Pertronix unit for AC VWs the other day.  Called the &quot;Pertronix II&quot;, and claiming improvements of ~200-400% over the performance of the original.

Anybody have any experience with one of these new systems?

************************************

&gt;well I have the Pertronix points eliminator (not full electronic
&gt;ignition) and it has worked rather well, haven't had to adjust it in 2-3
&gt;years, only maintenance is I change the dist cap every time I do a full
&gt;tune up so do a visual inspection then.  thats all.   but being the
&gt;paranoid so and so that I am, still have a good set of points and rotor
&gt;in my spare parts box.
&gt;
&gt;Bob
