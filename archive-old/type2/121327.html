Subject: Re: [T2] keys

Remove horn pad, steering wheel, switches, then the collar with ignition 
and steering lock. Then you can see the screw and follow Bentley 
instruction for drilling a hole to release the lock cylinder. Total R&amp;R for 
me is less than an hour. The first time I did it was probably 3 hours. Few 
locksmiths are equipped to address ANY Euro lock cylinder. The fact that 
some will sell soft metal keys proves a total lack of understanding of the 
animal they poke keys at.

&gt;I had a locksmith come out to rekey my seperate ignition key to match my 
&gt;doors key.  He couldn't get the ignition out.  Anyone have any tips on 
&gt;this?  Does the steering wheel have to come off?  Bentley says just remove 
&gt;the retaining screw and it should come out.  No luck here.
