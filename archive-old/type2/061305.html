Subject: What camper? HENGELA?

Can you Identify my camper?

It's of European origin I believe. LHD 1975/6, high indicators &amp; large
rear lights. It is not a &quot;walk through&quot; but the bulk-head has been cut
back to the seat base height.
 
High-top very much like the &quot;Safare`&quot; (see type2 web page, library,
camping then Safare` high-top), but the High-top has no windows &amp; is
totally smooth with no square edges or strengthener s other than 3
ridges out of sight on the top.

All the windows other than screen, rear &amp; doors (not sliding) are an
Aluminum D shape on it's side, double glazed &amp; hinged from the top so
the bottom pops out. All the interior is covered in teak effect
hard-board &amp; is clad behind in all the spaces with Polystyrene. I
expect due to the windows that this bus started off as a panel van &amp;
was converted to a camper. 

The interior is made from 1/2&quot; ply with a high wardrobe opposite the
sliding door, with 3 drop down doors, one of which becomes a work
surface across to the combined sink/hob with 2 rings &amp; a fridge
underneath the air vent for this exits as a louvered grill 2&quot; x 4&quot; in
the small pillar between the passenger door &amp; sliding door just above
the bulge. The bed is a &quot;rock &amp; roll&quot; type, with storage underneath.
It also has a drop-down table that opens out from the sink unit to the
ground once you have opened the sliding door.

I intend to take some pic's but have not had the time.
My ONLY clue is that it has a badge on each door in the shape of a
coat of arms. This has been painted over but appears to say &quot;HENGALA&quot;
(Italian?). If this is a DIY conversion then it has been done well &amp;
by an experienced camper, as all the fittings etc are well thought out.

Any ideas?
