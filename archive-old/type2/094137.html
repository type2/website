Subject: Re: [T2] question: replacing rear brake shoes

I tried the long bot idea also.  It did not work, I think that the threads
in the star adjuster we not good.  I found success with vice grips and a pry
bar.  This was the biggest pain for rear brakes.  Boy was I glad when those
finally came out.  Be careful to not break off the clips that keep the stars
from inadvertently turning.

&gt; I'm in the process of putting new shoes and wheel cylinders on the rear
&gt; brakes of my '78  bus. I've been using Bartnik's article on replacing rear
&gt; brake shoes, which so far have been great for a novice like me. I've run
&gt; into one snag however - removing (so I can replace) the star adjusters. I've
&gt; removed the adjuster screw, but the stars are pretty frozen. Bartnik's
&gt; article mentions using a bolt longer than the adjuster screw and threading
&gt; it in until the star just &quot;pops&quot; out easily. I've tried that, but no luck.
&gt; I'm not real comfortable cranking a bolt in there tighter and tighter
&gt; thinking the star adjuster is just going to pop loose. Can anyone offer
&gt; their experiece with this? Is there another way to try and remove them?
&gt; 
&gt; I sprayed liquid wrench on them last night, so maybe they'll give this
&gt; evening when I try again.
