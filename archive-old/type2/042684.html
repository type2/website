Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Today, I was looking at a friends new find.  It is  a 68 hardtop westy.  
&gt;
&gt;I noticed a couple of things.  
&gt;
&gt;1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no
&gt;latch and the rubber completely seals them in.
&gt;
&gt;2. It  doesn't have a door covering the gas tank.
&gt;
&gt;Is this something Volkswagen did on panel vans.
&gt;
&gt;The other odd things is that it does have a original clock.
&gt;

  I don't have any thoughts on it per se, but my 68 is kinda puzzling to me.
  
  1. it had a rear shelf, like a Westy.
  2. it has two-tone panels with chrome trim in the cargo area.
  3. it has jalousies (louvered windows) on the sides.
  It had an po-fabricated bed, and the original rear bench(es) is (are) missing. I don't think it was any kind of camper conversion. Judging from the panels, I would say it's a Deluxe? How do you distinguish a Kombi from a Deluxe?
