Subject: Converting 76 CA bus to 72-74 exhaust

Hello..

I am thinking of doing the opposite than shat Craig has in mind..he needs to
make his CA emissions work, I do not..........

I have a CA bus that appears to have all the emissions stuff on it, and did
run until the PO locked the motor up.............

Since I am in SC, I am thinking of swapping my heater boxes/exhaust to 72-74
style.................I guess I have to swap the left side intake runner,
too.............

Would this work for me?  Anything else I am missing?  The distributor that
is on it has 2 nipples, too............
