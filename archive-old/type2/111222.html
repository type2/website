Subject: HELP!! engine wireing questions!! trying to hook up replacement
  engine

Hey guys, I am finally ready to install the replacement
engine(supposedly from a '78 that had an engine fire) into
the '78 westy.....but as I have not had the advantage of
removing the origional one I am now at a loss.(most of it
is in a pile in my shed, but I can see there are thiungs
mising

 the wires do not completely match up....in particular from
the alternator!(I am using the harness that had come from
the bus, so it will match with the ECU, but there is one
wire I can't figure where it connects, and can't find the
lead that goes to teh temp? sensor by the distributor?

 the alternator that came on the engine has a cable from it
with two sub-cables...one tthe expected thick red
one....but the other one comfuses me....it has four wires 
brown, black, red, and green.
There is nowhere I can find on teh bus where this would
go...in fact I am not sure what should connect to the
alternator??
somehow I managed to LOSE my bently I got for it, and the
vanagon one really doesn't help huh?  ;-)

also...if there are any of you in teh San Jose area with a
similar year van or knowledgable? I really could use some
help once i actually install teh engine and try to start
hooking things up.

any help would be great!
