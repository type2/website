&gt;I am perplexed by the mixed mentality on synthetic oils. I use Mobil in my

What experts?  Please post your sources.

Synthetic oil causes leaks because it's &quot;too slippery&quot;
Synthetic oil doesn't transfer heat well
Synthetic oil will clog your engine with plastic
Synthetic oil traps heat
Synthetic oil will cause your crankshaft to crack (oh puh-leeze!)

Excuse my French but what a bunch of bull.  Why do people keep posting this 
hearsay?  Lots of people take such secondhand opinions as fact and the 
rumors are perpetuated.  I have 200,000+ miles of driving on synthetic oil 
under my belt and that personal experience tells me that synthetics are 
superior to non-synthetics in every way.  No sludge in my valve covers and 
no cracks in my crankshafts!!! If you don't believe me, go down to any 
racetrack and see what kind of oil the drivers are using in their cars.  Go 
ask Chevrolet why they fill every Corvette with it.  Better yet, try it 
yourself.  Come up with an informed opinion of your own.
