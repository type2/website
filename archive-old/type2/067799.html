&gt; &gt;I finally popped the money and got a spare tire front-mount
&gt; &gt;bracket and a white vinyl cover and put it on today, and although at first
&gt; &gt;it looked alarmingly Bozo-the-Clown-ish or Suffocating-Mime-ish [blue bus,
&gt; &gt;white top], I've decided it looks good.

In addition the transfer of the weight from beyond the rear axle
to the front of the bus must assist in stability
