Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

Consensus from previous threads on this topic (check archives) seemed
to be that Vanagon is underpowered due to its weight, but has superior
handling and more interior space. Its more logical use of interior
space is also found in late bays. My experience with both seems to
bear this out. We ultimately are in bays because of California smog
and the easier access to components for repair, meaning easy to work
on.

 I want a good Westfalia camper, can't decide if I'll get a Baywindow or an
 air-cooled Vanagon.
 I think I like the looks of the Baywindow better but I also like the
 Vanagon very much and it has some advantages, any advice?
