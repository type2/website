Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Fluke 77 continuity?

&gt; My leads on my fluke 77 are only 4.5' long. I don't see how I am to hook the
&gt; neg lead to the neg terminal on the battery and test voltage on something in
&gt; the dash area, the bus is 16' long and one of the wires I wanted to test
&gt; continuity/resistance on goes from the starter to the dash/instrument cluster.
&gt;
&gt; Do they make longer leads?

just get a long piece of wire and extend it
if youre measuring voltage to ground you just use the chassis.
