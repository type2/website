     Well, I've been junkyard shopping for rims. Haven't come up with
any Mecedes rims so far, but found some from a '93 BMW 325i that are
close, they're 15x7, the offset and center hub hole are right, but the
spacing between the stud holes is just a hair bigger, like 2.75&quot; rather
than the 2.625&quot; on my bus. Not sure if they'll fit or not. Then there's
a pair of Jeep Cherokee rims that also are right for offset, hub hole,
and are 15x7, but they've only got two. These have the same exact 2 5/8&quot;
spacing as my bus, which is weird, since another set of Cherokee rims
have the 2 3/4&quot; spacing, all else being correct. 
     BTW, this place wants $200 a set of 4 for these alloy rims -- which
seems a bit steep.
     Would 7&quot; rims be too wide for 205's? I'm going with 225s in the
rear, 205s in the front.
