Subject: Re:Stuck bus...something ain't right

&gt;tonight it happened again. same parking space. same thing. didn't happen at
&gt;my house...didn't happen anywhere else. what could this be? IBM gremlins?

OK, OK, I've got an idea .

How about this: Is that spooky parking space where you get stuck
next to an irrigated landscape that is throwing water against the
side of your car at wheel level? This might cause your brake 
calipers to freeze only in one parking spot and not in others.

Just a thought. 

Drive safely,
