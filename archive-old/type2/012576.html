Subject: Friday Bus Poll
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
i thought id throw a friday bus poll at everyone. 
something all of you can reply to, even those lurkers
out there :)  the poll question is:
What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious as
to how many out there are driving restored beauties
down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
drive?

A)Restored Example

B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
original nice condition)

C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
there or just a touch of rust)

D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
maybe not quite that bad:)

reply back to me and ill try and gather the results
and post back to the list.  so even those out there
who dont post often, reply back.  ill throw in the
first vote:
1973 Riviera- D an excellent beater example:)
happy friday
shelby
