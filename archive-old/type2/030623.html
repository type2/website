Ladies, Gentlemen, and the rest of you :-)

First let me offer my public and profound thanks to Barry Burneskis, a
wonderful and helpful man to whom I already owed more than I could ever
repay.  And now he's gone and made it even worse! :-)))

Second, I am now the extremely proud owner of a 1980 Vanagon Deluxe
Westafalia.  Included are not only the usual sink stove and fridge, but a
*BA6*!!!!!  

This vehicle is precisely the one I have been looking for, right down to
the blown engine.  The body is virtually mint, a lovely ivory, with only
one minor ding in the passenger side door.  The van appears to have been
meticulously maintained and is clean as a whistle.

It was bought in Germany and brought to the CA in 1980, then spent the
next four years there. After that it went to the Homestead/Miami, FL area
where it lived well inland, away from salt spray for the next 14 years. 
At that point the story takes a turn for the worse, as it got a &quot;rebuild&quot;
that can only be described as catastrophic.. On this rebuild it was driven
to the DC area last July and sold to it's second owner.  He tried to
correct the problems with the &quot;rebuild&quot;, failed and put it up for sale. 
how do I know this? Because I have every reciept!!  right back to the
import papers!!!

Barry saw it in the paper (I missed it :-(, went over and kept the
owner talking 'til he could get in touch with me, I went and wrote the
check.  Thank you again, Barry :-)

Now... normally a blown engine is bad thing, but in this instance, I was
looking for precisely that.  I want to and will install a nice new rebuild
preparatory to my next &quot;round the block&quot; tour, which is currently
scheduled to commence this coming Memorial Day and last thru July 4th.
Since I will be on the road for the whole of that time, even a &quot;low
milage&quot; or good original engine carries certain risks that I would prefer
to avoid.  A new, under-warrantee engine does that nicely :-)

Anyone who wants to come over and look is welcome to.  The van will be
arriving (by tow truck) shortly after 8:00 this evening at my folks garage
in Springfield.  Let me know if you need directions.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
