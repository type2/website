I just bought a '65 camper from some guy and I know he did some crazy wiring
job
on it because the high beam switch that was on the floor is now a toggle
switch
on the dash. My question is this: On the left hand side of the section of the
dash that has the speedo on it there is a white, plastic toggle switch that
toggles up and down. Is that supposed to be there? If so what is it, what is
it
for and what am I supposed to do with it?

this is the front switch for the rear overhead interior light.  if you leave
the light on in the back, you can turn it off in the front with that switch.
