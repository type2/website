Subject: Re: Unleaded fuel

&gt; Here is my question:  in Australia we will find it hard or very expensive
&gt; to use unleaded fuel after the year 2000.  The mechanic I use here tells me
&gt; the engine is not really designed for unleaded, although he could import
&gt; different valves, an upper cylinder lubricant injector and a catalytic
&gt; convertor...  Heck! ...

   This is an '82? It sure should be designed for unleaded -- I think you
need to get another mechanic, sounds like he's just trying to sell you a
load. Everyone here burns unleaded -- in fact I think it's rather
difficult to get leaded fuel anymore.
