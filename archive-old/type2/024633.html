--part1_88.a022142.28977cd8_boundary

I have a 77' Bus, I just got it and its the first car I've actually worked on 
a lot.  I learned to drive a stick on it and I took it to a body shop to put 
a new floor in, they had to disconnect the steering, stick, and pedals from 
the floor.  When they put it back in second gear grinded really bad and third 
gear was up a lot further, I had to take off my shift knob so the stick could 
fit under the dash and pop into third gear.  Any help would be greatly 
appriciated.

Andrew
