Subject: Re: [T2] Megasquirt on 82 Vanagon

Actually, can we kinda keep this a little on-the-list?  It is of interest
because the FI was totally removed from a friends 80 Westy.  If needed, we
can take it off-list if there are only a couple of people interested.

&gt; Hello list,  I am making slow progress installing a new Megasquirt
&gt; injection system on the bus and could use a leg up from the guys who
&gt; have done this on the same engine.
&gt; I am using MS-II, V3.0 board, fuel only until I get everything running
&gt; well, then ignition control as well.
&gt; I cannot get it to idle, and only runs when I advance the ignition a lot.
&gt; I would love to get your .msq and VE tables if you have arrived at a
&gt; tuning set-up that you are happy with.  Are you running the original low
&gt; impedance injectors? with PWM or resistors?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks very much. I will take this off list now, I just wanted to
&gt; contact the VW guys on megasquirt as directly as I could.
