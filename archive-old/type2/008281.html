Hey Y'all,
  I want to ask some brake related questions. I have a 70 that is my
daily driver and a 73 parts bus. I want to pull all the brakes off the
73 and put them on the 70. I have pulled the front beam off the 73 and
will referb it and install it as a unit on the70. I will have to get
an intake manifold with the port on the side for the booster. I will
also have to run a tube to the front for the booster. I will use the
master and the proportioning valve. 
  Has anyone ever done this. I plan to swap all the rear suspention to
keep the wheels the same all around. 
  The reason I want to do this is that 1. I have all the stuff for
free. 2. most of the stuff for 73-79 is the same and a lot cheaper
than the 71-72 stuff and the 70 drums stuff.  I don't want to have to
hunt around for the early stuff and pay the high prices. 
  I concidered keeping the rear the same but I would have to use some
wheel adapters to make it all work out.
  I know some will not approve of this modification, but I hate drum
brakes and am tired of fighting them, I want disks. In the end I will
basicly have a 71 bus mechanicly ( I allready updated the engine).
  Does anyone have any advice? (constructive)
