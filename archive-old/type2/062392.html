Well go to a hobby shop or an arts store.  There is dye especially for this (I 
think the stuff we used was a powder alled Procon MX or something like that).  
Check out my web page to see how it turns out.  You need soda ash, salt, urea, 
and some smelly stuff I can't remember.  It's more work than I thought it would 
be. It can only be used on 100% cotton.  If you use it on a mixed fabric only 
the cotton part will dye well.  But it is permanent.  We have washed our duvet 
cover and pillowcases several times and they do not fade.
