Subject: Re: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)

&gt; I just got an order delivered from Bus Depot for my 67. I ordered 2 left
&gt; &gt; fronts, 2 right fronts, and 2 rears.  Both left fronts and both rear
were
&gt; &gt; Brazilian. Both right fronts are from China.

Duh!  I have no idea what I was reading on the left front boxes. The boxes
are made in USA and the cylinders are from India. Oh well,
China/India....both 5 letters, both have an i and a n, and both end with A.
