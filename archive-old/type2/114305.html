Subject: Re: [T2] Axle differences 71-79

Didn't all 1971 to 1979 come with disc brakes, 1971 and 1972 being of a 
different style and have their own unique spindle, caliper, and rotor.  I 
think that the ones you are looking at with drum brakes came from a 1970 or 
older one.

&gt; Can I use any front axle beam of this period on my '79?  A couple I've 
&gt;  looked at had drum brakes, can I change these over to my disc setup 
&gt;  (are the spindles the same)?
&gt;  
&gt;  Still working on getting the old one out.  What a pain!  I might have 
&gt;  to resort to air tools :-)
