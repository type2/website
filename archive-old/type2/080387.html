Subject: Tough steering

I finally got my bus roadworthy and running well. I
took it out for its maiden voyage last night and had a
large hesitation in the steering when i made a left
turn. It seemed like it didn't want to turn and then
&quot;pop&quot; (not audible) and it threw me in to the turn.
Afterwards while going striaght it kept pulling to the
right. It doesnt do this everytime, sometimes it's
just fine. What do i need to do??
