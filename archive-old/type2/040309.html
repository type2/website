Subject: Transaxel Fluid

      Hi All!

All the talk re: GL5 tranny fluid  has me scared. I changed my old (real
old),tranny fluid recently with
semi-synthetic 90 weight fluid good for GL4 and GL5 but now think i should
use something different.
No one seems to have in stock or from their suppliers GL4 only fluid.
I picked up 4L of Motomaster TDH Fluid
(transmission,Differential,hydraulic)and this is what it states on the
container,&quot;28-0215-6 Tdh is formulated for use in most OEM's
farm,construction and industrial equipment with a common oil system for
transmission,differential,wet brakes and hydraulics. Meets the requirments
of John Deere J20C spec. and meets or exceeds field performance requirements
for all major tractor manufacturers.
       Motomaster TDH is an API GL4 fluid that also meets the perfromance
requirments of Allison C-3/C-4 and Caterpillar TO-2 specs&quot;
        The only reason i picked it up is the GL4 rating but i won't install
it till i hear some positive feedback.
Any other sorces in Ontario Canada?

Thanks
