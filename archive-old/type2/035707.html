&gt; I saw a 75-79 westy with a roof mounted air conditioning unit. I've seen
&gt; this bus a couple of times, but finally I was able to pull along side and
&gt; get a good look. The front luggage rack was completely removed, and an
&gt; RV/Van type AC unit was sitting right on the roof above the forward cab.
