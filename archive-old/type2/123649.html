Subject: DVDA diaphragm

I'm curious about the mechanism inside of  a dual vacuum advance distributor.

Is there a single diaphragm that is being pulled from both sides by 
vacuum applied to the two ports on the biscuit?

If  so, then is it a true statement that, as the throttle is opened 
slightly, the point plate moves continuously from a position that was 
set to give  a timing of 5 deg ATDC to a position corresponding to 
the maximum vacuum-advance value allowed by the type of vacuum can?
