Subject: Rainbow Wagon update!

Hey Everyone...
just thought i'd post back up, on the diagnosis 
that i've finally made on our broke down 
70westie. after pullin the rear wheel, i've 
found that we have a bad drum. the grooves are 
stripped right off of her. which explains the 
grinding noise that i was hearing, before she 
gave up. 
now was this due to a loose axle nut? or what? 
anyways...thanks again for all the help that the 
list passed our way to figure this out. and i'm 
sure the wagon will be up and runnin soon. 
*shine on* -Chris in NW Iowa
