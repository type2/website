Subject: Oil pump/Cam questions
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all -

I have a 71 Campmobile with an AH prefix 1600 that I
am rebuilding to go in
it. The worn cam that came out was a four bolt
dished-gear type. The oil
pump was, in my opinion, worn out (.010 clearance
between gears, cover
really scored). The P.O., while a really nice guy,
cuts a lot of corners. He
said the engine overheated (not seized) and he stopped
driving it. My
teardown/inspection bears this out.
My questions are, what is the correct cam/oil pump
configuration for this
engine? Does it matter whether I use a 3 or 4 bolt
cam, as long as the oil
pump matches? Will *any* pump fit my case, or are
there case oil passage
matching issues? Finally, how do I tell whether a pump
will match up with a
3 or 4 bolt cam?

TIA,

Tom
