Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust knowledge starved...

To append:

What gives w/the cloth &quot;net&quot; behind the metal lining of the heat exchangers? 
  I was considering trying to use some sort of cleaning solvent to wash out 
the exchanger &amp; eliminate any oily/exhaust particle buildup that might be 
contributing to my smelly, smoky dilemma.  Would this backing (&amp; baffling, 
possibly insulative, I guess...) be harmed by rinsing the exchanger?

I went ahead &amp; tried my 'blow test' on the exchanger.  Just using my hands 
to cover the exhaust entry &amp; exit ports, I placed my mouth to the open 
exhaust port &amp; blew.  Once I'd adjusted my hands to ensure no air 
hissing/leaking (that I could determine), I continued to maintain pressure.  
For about as long as I could do that, I detected no noticeable decrease in 
pressure.  This tells me (I think) that I don't have a large hole in the 
exhaust.  I don't think I'd be able to determine if there is a small leak, 
however.  I'm also uncertain whether I really understand the wood plug 
technique used by another member; my exchangers have a little play between 
the housing &amp; the exhaust manifold.  I could see this working if I plugged 
the exhaust ports.  Should I have this space?  If not, how do I seal it up 
airtight (optimistically assuming I don't have to exchange my exchangers 
after all)?

Also, I'd asked about a sealant to use on the exchanger-to-heat flap 
connecting pipe.  Should I seal the air ducts coming off of the blower &amp; on 
into the exhaust, as well?  I'm guessing yes, but I don't feel I've 
developed an uncanny VW intuition as of yet.

Thanks for listening (again) &amp; hopefully responding,
