==========================
Hi Giff,

Packing the oil pump with grease or petroleum jelly is the correct
procedure, just as Mike had said,
but the reason for packing it with grease is so that the oil pump has
something to &quot;pump&quot; as soon as possible. 

The pump does not &quot;suck&quot;. 
The pump &quot;pumps&quot;, and 
Only if pumping, can the flowing oil develop a pressure drop on the inlet
side of the pump, allowing the net positive head of the oil to then enter
into the pump. Once this cycle starts, the engine oil then comes in to
fill the void on the inlet side of the pump, and the oil, in turn, is
pushed out into the system by the pressurization of the pump gears.

Without packing the pump, you are relying on only the close running
tolerances of the pump elements (intermeshed gears) to initially develop
this pressure drop on the inlet side of the pump, something which may
occur, but, then again, maybe not. 

The VW gear (oil) pump is not self priming, as such, but it will maintain
a pumping cycle, once it is primed, which you are doing with the packing
of grease or petroleum jelly.

I'm probably not very good at describing what I am trying to say here.
Just another reason for me to be out of, and away from:
