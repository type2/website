&gt; Chris, Thanks for the reply.
&gt; 
&gt; *That* is the problem; if only I could pull the circlips and pins. As I wrote 
&gt; in my initial post, the cases are split and separated by nearly 3&quot;. This 
&gt; means that the pins are down inside the bore where they are inaccessible. 
&gt; And, the cases won't rejoin, so I just can't get to the clips and pins.

I would suspect it is your rings that are hanging the pistons up, long
thin screwdriver could wiggle em past the obstruction.    cutting a
connecting rod is a job you don't even want to think about, those buggers
are hard.
