Shawn
you CAN wire the cap 180 out to compensate for the gear being off but
ONLY if you promise to fix the problem right real soon.

instead of              do

     3                      1
4         2           2         4
     1                      3

Saith the venerable and confused Shawn
&quot;The dizzy was 180 degrees out.  It can't be rotated enough to time
properly&quot;
