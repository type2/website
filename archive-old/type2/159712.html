Subject: Re: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

&gt; Pic 4: What are those two white tablets in the bottom left corner? Did the
&gt; guy drop some of the speed he was on when he painted the van?

Looks like hydrocodone (vicodin) to me...  Eh, not that I'd know about
these things...  :-)

A couple hundred/thousand of those WOULD explain the sorry condition of
this bus.
