&lt;&lt; What (in Fahrenheit) is hot?  What is normal?  What is hot but is still ok
 to drive?  When should I just shut the motor down?  When it gets &quot;in the
 red&quot; do I just shut it down or should I let it idle to cool itself off
 first? &gt;&gt;


im quoteing most of this from another post i got from the archives, i printed 
it out a long time ago and well, it sort of found its way into that pile of 
vw and porsche books right next to my computer. 


&quot;
&gt; 180 F: Too cool
180-210: Peachy
210-250: Can live with it; many buses with type 4 engine's get that hot
250-280: Something is wrong and must be fixed; however, viscosity of good 
synthetic   oil should be fine. If its after dark and im 10 miles away from 
hime i keep driveing
&lt;  280 F: Better stop and let the engine idle (the fan will cool it), unless 
of corse the oil pressure light is on (shut off immediately!).

&quot;

oh, not sure about the oil pressure guage, i just have the vdo one that goes 
in the spot for the idiot light..
