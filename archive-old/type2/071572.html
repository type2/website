&gt;2.  Underneath the bus in the center there is what appears to be a large
&gt;radiator/heat exchanger type of device with hoses coming out of each end.
&gt;Two of the hoses are in the engine compartment, where the auxiliary bettery
&gt;would be, but are not connected. Not sure yet where the other two end up.
&gt;Any ideas.

This item is for an air conditioner. Where the hoses end in the engine bay is 
where the compressor used to be (I'm assuming that you don't have the 
compressor because you would have described that, too). Do you have an 
overhead A/C unit up front? Should be right above your head if you sit in the 
driver's seat. Pretty hard to miss..... that's where the other hoses should 
go, but I'm not sure where they're routed through. 

Congrats on your new family member!
