Subject: [T2] THANKS

we'll i did some more digging...

i originally didn't want to &quot;screw the system&quot; by putting antique plates on 
the car and then driving it across the country. but....

since the bus is more than 25 years old, i don't need to take the emissions 
test ANYWHERE in va.  (that's $20 less i have to pay as well.)  AND, just 
because it is an antique, DOES NOT mean i have to have antique plates.

i could, but i won't, because i would like it to pass safety 
inspection....for the good of me!

so, screw the EGR and such....but what brand is my damn CARB!!!....i forgot 
to mention that there were 2 vacuum lines IN, that have no lines to them 
(blocked off.)  (one in the air filter assembly....something that gets 
through the carb without having to pass through the air filter, and the 
other on the opposite side of the throttle lever.)

wheh, well some stuff is better...now to pass safety!
