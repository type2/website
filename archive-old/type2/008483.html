Has anybody on the list ever had there vans professionally painted?  I was
just wondering what a 2 tone bus would cost around with some rust (no holes)
and no dents.. just getting an estimate...

Also, I was wondering if there were any type2_dot_com t's out there? if not
would anybody be interested in doing one or having one?

Thanks,
Mike
