Subject: Re: summer vacation ! 

michel,
as far as takin 66, i did it a few years back in
august in a 78 dodge van.   i had the time of my life,
but it was hot as hell.   especially around the grand
canyon, of course i detoured by vegas, where it was
103f at 12:30 at night.   had a couple overheating
problems in the van, so a aircooled would probably be
pretty freakin hot, but if in good running condition
should be ok, just take it slow.   camping was
unbearable some nights, just too hot, but hotel/motels
are pretty abundant and cheap if you dont care about
where youre sleeping...read &quot;grungy&quot;.   the trip was
great though, saw a ton, memories forever, i just wish
i woulda had my bus for it.   i hope to do the trip
again this fall in my bus actually.   just take a
print out off the AIRS site and enjoy the scenery.
