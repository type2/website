&gt;So, after reading the info on Boston Bobs website about Hydro lifters
&gt;I am begining to think that having solids and adjusting the valves at the

&gt;not letting the valve close all the way. Anyone agree?

Nope.  :)  Solids can also not let the valve close all the way and cause 
burnt valves.  Much more common, in fact.  You can have my hydraulic 
lifters when you pry them from my cold, dead hands.  :-)
