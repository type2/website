Subject: Re: [T2] worried about engine damage

Bernard:

Anytime items peripheral to the engine block itself are not in tip-top shape 
you have to know you're not doing the block any good, the question is, how 
much damage might you be doing?

If you drove the vehicle 1,000m and just now noticed exhaust leaks then 
they're obviously not gaping holes and I'd say a slight reduction in 
backpressure probably isn't going to hurt things immediately.

As far as the AFM goes, a too-lean condition probably has more potential to 
damage the engine (burned valves and cracked heads) then a too-rich 
condition (carbon build-up) so you need to understand which problem you're 
facing.  Because of the nature of the AFM (an internal spring that weakens 
over time) and based on your description (feathering of gas) I'd guess 
you're running too rich.

Subject: [T2] worried about engine damage


&gt; Hi, just installed a rebuilt 2.0L FI engine into my '77 westy.Took it on a
&gt; 1000m round trip and it went great! I was told that I need an airflow 
&gt; meter
&gt; because under 3000 rpm it doesn't have very much power and I have to 
&gt; feather
&gt; the gas to get it going.Also I noticed tonight that I have some bad exaust
&gt; leaks on both sides at the U pipes.I am concerned that driving it in this
&gt; condition will damage the engine.Will  it ??The reason I ask is that it is 
&gt; a
&gt; daily driver and I can't afford to fix it yet.
&gt; Thanks,any advice will be very much appreciated.
&gt; Bernard,
