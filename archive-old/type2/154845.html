Subject: Really long RCA cable for Type2

This may not seem like a real Type 2 problem but it is when you consider our unique layout.

I put an amp in the closet in the back of my 1977 Westy and need an RCA cable about 25 feet long to get from my head unit to the amp.

25 feet is 7.6 meters and all of the regular companies like Monster Cable sell 2, 4, and 6 meter cables.

6 meters is 19.6 feet, way too short.

Where can I get an above average quality RCA cable, that is shielded so I can run a remote wire and speaker wire alongside of it, that is 25' long?

I don't want to spend a lot, I am thinking $65.00 maximum

I am in Portland, Oregon, something local would be nice but not necessary.

Thanks,

James in Portland, Oregon
