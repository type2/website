&gt; &gt; ok here is the deal on my tire questions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; a lot of the archives mention getting stronger sidewall strength in your
&gt; &gt; tires ( ie light truck tires etc.)  but have many of you actually searched
&gt; &gt; tire shops for these tires.  light truck tires rarely have much more side

yup and I recently discovered a Special order Michelin that is not in all
the catalogs.   (took several months of searching)

it is the MXT tire, this is a light truck radial that is avaliable in most
sizes used on the bus.  I found mine at NTB (National Tire &amp; Battery) but
an another NTB I visited earlier had no clue???

I run a shorter wider tire for stability so I got 205/70R14 tires

have had them about two months now and am very satisfied, only down side
was the price,  !!!! over $100 per tire!!!!


&gt; &gt; fwiw..the van is a work van....i haul loads in it regularly.  heavy loads up
&gt; &gt; to 2500+ is only once a month.

I use mine for work too and it weighs in at 3980 lbs!
