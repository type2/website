Subject: Re: [T2] new engine

&gt; years ago. It went 100,000 mile without a burp. I pulled it because of a main
&gt; seal  leak and decided it was time for the whole thing. Bob is most helpful

If all that's wrong with the old engine is a leaky main seal, can I have 
it? After all, that seal costs less than $10 and with 100K miles, you were 
probably due a new clutch disk and changing the main seal with the clutch 
adds maybe five minutes to the job...
