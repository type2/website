Subject: VDO cyl head temp gauge: where to run sender wire?

Has anyone found an optimal route for the 15 ft. sender wire from the
sending unit to the cylinder head temperature gauge?

I've tried several different routes *inside* my 74 camper, each one leaving
me about 2-3 ft. short. I suspect that I need to go outside the bus from the
front, along the bottom outside, then through the engine tin. But if I do
this, will I need to find some sort of insulation to wrap around the two
wires to protect them?

The archives indicate that I shouldn't lengthen the wire because it will
affect the readings.

Thanks,
Victor
