Subject: Serious problems with gas

One of my VW's is out of commission as of this weekend pending resolution of
some really weird stuff going on with the fuel system.  Any help you guys
can provide would be a boost, as I'm not well acquainted with some of the
parts involved.  My symptoms (1970):  Started to lose power, and response to
throttle.  At the same time, start smelling raw gas.  Actually, I seemed to
smell gas here and there for about a week prior to the power loss.  OK, so I
limp home and open engine compartment, no gas smell here, but the clear fuel
filter is almost empty, making me think gas starvation.  So then I check
under the fuel tank, and notice fuel steadily dripping out a tiny hose
straight from the tank.  Fuel hose going back to engine seems fine. Open gas
lid and see the compartment is full of gas, even though the cap is on,
weird.  So I went back to engine, pulled the out hose from from fuel pump
and turned the engine a few times.  Fuel would squirt but only on every 3 or
4 turns. 

I have a few ideas but there seems to be more than one problem- the fuel
delivery and the fuel leakage but they must be related.???

1 Fuel line blockage?
2 Bad pump/ pressure regulator?

Any theories?
