Hello--

Thanks for all the help with Generator Removal, Wiring, Intake Manifold...I 
got everything hooked up...went to start my bus and it was stumbling all over 
and I heard some popping...which makes me think some type of leak...it 
sounded like the popping was coming from the Driver Side which happens to be 
the only port that I took off when I changed out the Manifold...Has anyone 
had experience with a port loose....and would it sound like a pop. 
Also...what does the engine do when the Generator and the Battery are not in 
harmony..._dot_cause it felt when I would engage the start it would snag and 
go...snag and go....Any advice would be great...Thank you
