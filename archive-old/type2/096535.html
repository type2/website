Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Gas Tank prefilter

TJ,

There was no such thing in my 78 when I took it out.

There is a &quot;bowl&quot; around the two pipes on a 78.  It has small openings
around the bottom perimeter to allow gas to get in to the bowl after the 
gas level falls below about 3/8 of a tank full.  The bowl is squarish 
shapped and about 3 inches high and about 6-8&quot; &quot;square&quot;.

One of the listees has some great shots of inside the tank when he took 
his out around the same time to clean it also.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;&gt;So that was the screen I heard rolling across the bottom of the tank
&gt; when I blew air up the line (gas drained) to see if it was clear?  It's
&gt; been running fine since I did that.  Doesn't the pipe help guard against
&gt; a large piece of crud from sliding over/into the opening and blocking
&gt; the flow to the external filter?&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And is there one in the 78??
