Subject: Off Body Bus Restos

Hey Volks!

Has anyone ever been brave and/or strong enough to attempt an off body 
restoration of an early bus?  Is it possible?  Thinking about doing this 
to a '66 Kombi I am thinking of buying.  Everything is solid, but after 
doing an off body resto of my '57 Beetle I now see the advantages of 
doing it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
