&gt; I'm looking for a late 1970s Westy, and I came across this posting
today:  
&gt;  ------------------------------
&gt;  1. ...a 1977 Westfalia overnighter/hard top...asking $4,500 firm.
&gt;  2. ...a 1978 VW transporter...asking $3,200 firm....
&gt;  ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; So my questions to all the virual inhabitants of the community here
is:
&gt; 
&gt; What is the convention for listing prices here?
&gt; 
&gt; If the price is &quot;asking&quot;, can one assume that there MAY be some room
for
&gt; negotiation?
&gt; 
&gt; If the price is &quot;firm&quot;, can one assume that the owner will NOT sell it
&gt; for any lower price?  (Of course, this may mean that the current owner
&gt; will NOT sell it at all.)
&gt; 
&gt; It follows that:
&gt; 
&gt; What in the hell does &quot;asking $xxxx firm&quot; mean?

It means that the person is asking you to give them $xxxx and that
they won't sell the bus for less than that amount.  Seems pretty clear
to me!

However (and this is a big however!) I used to participate in the
buying and selling of quite a few vehicles.  My experience is that no
price is really firm unless the seller really doesn't want to sell the
vehicle or unless someone comes along with more money than brains (not
a rare type!).

The true worth of a vehicle is the price that you're willing to part
with to possess it.  If that sum is more than the price the seller
must have to part with the vehicle, then you both will be happy with
the deal.  If it isn't, the deal won't happen.  No reason to fret!

If your price is turned down, then wait a week or so and make the
offer again.  Often the passage of time will change the seller's idea
of the worth of his vehicle.

If the seller mentions that other buyers have already made offers on
the car, take his statement with a grain of salt.  I've seldom seen
these other bidders in the flesh, and never had one actually buy a
vehicle.

Above all, don't fall in love with a car before you buy it.  It's a
machine, after all!
