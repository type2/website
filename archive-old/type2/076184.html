Subject: Re: [T2] Shell Rotella/XLA

David Bell sends:

&gt; What is the opinion on the list of the Shell Rotella 15W40 dino oil? It
&gt; would be for use in a daily driver 1974 T2, 1.8 ltr, with hydraulic lifters.
&gt; I live and drive in western KY where the winter temps rarely go as low as 0F
&gt; and usually average in the 30's to low 40's. In the summer we can have
&gt; daytime temps of 90+ for days or weeks at a time. Most of my driving is
&gt; short trips, ie, 10 miles to work, 5 miles to Wally World, 20 or 30 miles of
&gt; errands around town, with an occasional 50 mile trip to the big city.
&gt; 
&gt; Just looking for opinions, especially from those who have used this oil.

Rotella's good stuff. It's made for diesels, which run at higher temps than
gas engines. (However, a diesel has even lower tolerance for overheating
than a VW aircooled engine does, if that's possible.) I run the 30-weight in
my Bug (in the Bus I am trying a few different things; right now I've got
SAE 40 Exxon Superflo in it since it's the only SL-rated oil the FLAPS I
went to had) and would recommend you do the same between April and October.
