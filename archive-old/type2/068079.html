Subject: Urgent.!!!! Help wanted

Hi Type 2'er

I have been in your list as a watcher because I am not a owner of a 
type 2 yet. I decided to wait until the right chance appear and maybe 
this time is now.
I finally found a pretty nice 1976 Westfalia (at least I think it is) 
and because my Volkswagen expertise belong to Beetles I asking for 
help in your place.
Could some body tell me what I should  look for in a mechanical side 
(oil leaks, rusted areas, engine noises, obyous problems) and how this 
particular models are equipped (Original equipment, ussual problems 
with them, missing parts, etc.) ? in order to have some elements to 
judge if it worth or not.
Caracteristics:
Model: Westfalia
Year: 1976
Engine: 2500 cc FI. (Original 2000 cc, with Okrasa kit)
Extras: Koni shock absorbers, Antiblock (some device like a 
Positraction that transfer the power to the wheel with traction), 100 
watt halogen lights.

P/D I have an appoiment whit the owner to see the car tomorrow 
afternoon, that why I need some answer before tomorrow¹s noon. Please 
E-mail me to realvaradoc_at_etheron_dot_net because I got the digest option, 
Thank you very much
