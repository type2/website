Gregory and the list,

I don't know about Webers, but my dual Kadron setup improved immensely when
I upped the output of the accelerator pumps.  It is important that they put
out the same amount as well.  I calibrated mine using a graduated cylinder,
but you could do the same with a medicine spoon that can be bought for about
$1.  If the graduations are too big, just pump it a few times and divide the
amount by the number of pumps to get an average.  The word for Kadrons with
a 1600 engine is 0.4-0.8 cc/stroke.  I have mine set at 0.6 cc/stroke and it
drives much better than before.  Perfectly? No, but then these never did
drive like our modern computer controlled, fuel injected cars of today.

Happy Bussin'
