Subject: Re: [T2] 79 California FI acting up


&gt; My fuel injection system is working. The bus is running, but I have 
FI AFM Adjustment= screw the adjuster down, back it out it gets leaner.
If you can take four full turns on the screw without getting some results
then suspect the FI. If the four turns make a difference in idle speed
and smoothness then the FI AFM is probably ok.
Take a can of Ether or Berrymsns B-12 and spray it around the locations
that draw vaccum and if the engine speeds up then you've found your leak.
