Jamie,

Would like to know what kinda answers you get. I have akways had trouble
with the pedal in the 72. It seems off center to the right. and the arm that
attaches to it often comes off. I was under duress when I had the pan aff to
change my broken accel cable so I did not investgate very carefully now wish
I had. My cable  breaks at that throttle linkage to that nasty weber 32/36
carb. ALWAYS CARRY A SPARE!

Here is what I do to set my cable. 

Looen nut that holds cable at throttle linkage.
Make sure throttle arm on carb is all the way down(idle position)
Pull cable taught witha pair of pliers and turn the screw that tightens the
cable
Have someone push down on the pedal(a cinderblock might work here) and then
see if you can push the throttle arm on the card any farther fwd. If so
repeat earlier steps.

After all is said and done check the tension on the cable between the carb
and front tin. It should not be bar tight but have a little play but not
slackness in it.    

By the way with the Weber setup on my bus I have added a grommet(peice of
hose actually) to the tin to keep the calble from rubbing. Also lightly
grease cable as it is inserted.

I am gonna post this to the list too cause maybe I am doing it wrong and
would like to know!
