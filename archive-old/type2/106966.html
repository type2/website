Subject: Illegal Bus Chronicles Vol. I - Naming the bus (long)

Funny that someone should bring up the old-timers from the 90's.

During the 90's I was in high school being transported by my three best friends in either of two squarebacks (RIP) or the bus I now own.

Having read a lot of Bob Hoover's sermons and Charlie Ford's work as well, I wonder why there's not as much bus fiction/folklore/talltaletellin' as there used to be.

So I've decided to take a half-assed effort towards some more of that with my new series IBC, which will chronicle my outlaw driving with expired tags and a gross-polluter strike on my head on the streets of california.

It may be boring, you may not like it, but I feel the muse people, and you're stuck with me. Today is offically Day 108 of illegal bus drivin'.

I'VE NAMED THE BUS.

Some of you may be familiar with Douglass Adams work, &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. It seems to have crosscultural connections with busfolk as it tells a corny sci-fi tale of moving around the galaxy which is really a vehicle for making a lot of tongue-in-cheek social and political commentaries.

It's like Monty Python in literature format.

Here's the bus part. In the story, there is a crucial new spaceship called the Heart of Gold. The Heart of Gold has a revolutionary new engine called the Improbability Drive. 

When engaged, the improbability drive takes you to/from places/times thru a navigational process that has less to do with time/space than it does with probabilities and chances. Not perfect, not accurate, but functional.

And I realized, as I fight my way thru the bazillion layers of the calfornia smog system (DMV, smog ref, offical smog tester, unoffical smog tester, local garage, buddies, listmembers....) that the chances of me coming thru this with a legal functional bus on a short time/budget window are phenomenally poor.

But,

If I do, It would be just like the improbability drive on the Heart of Gold transporting the antagonists of the story out of certain fiery death thru barely reasonable mathmatical equations and depositing them in a bowl of pudding on the other side of the universe.

I think that if my bus ever sees fresh california tags again that I will relate the experiences.

Also, it's a good Neil Young song, which I will have to explain endlessly is not how I named it.

Also, I can call it the H.O.G. !

p.s. to Steve Pribyl: I finally get it!

Henceforth, let it be known buspilots,

Billy
