Hi, Im a recent subscriber to the list and I have some fairly simple 
questions.  I own a 74 automatic and the transmission seem to be getting 
weak. It clunks into first and someimes into second.  I was wondering if 
when the time comes I can substitute a manual transmission in the bus for 
the automatic without too much trouble and too much extra cost.  At this 
point it seem that it will be easier to find a manual as opposed to an 
automatic.  some wisdom please. Thankyou
