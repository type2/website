Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow: Yikes! Hardship Trek

Jennifer,

Oil light fixed is primary importance.  

Working *new* windshield wipers...bus might run good, but if you
can't see where you are going...well...really bad.

Check all brake/turn signal lights....ya want the other guys to see you as 
well...

It would be nice if the heater worked!

It's always the little things that make the trip nicer....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Folks,
&gt; 
&gt;   Been driving the bus almost exclusively and have racked up a lot of
&gt; happy and uneventful miles.  We have had an unfortunate diagnosis within
&gt; the family and will be making a very long trek.  We only have the bus to

snipped

&gt;   Aside from needing to drive wearing a down sleeping bag with leg holes,
&gt; what urgent or glaring items would YOU jump on to get ready?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You Thank You Thank You,
