Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus Manuals

Some of us were pleasantly surprised to find an official Robert Bentley
booth at OktoBugFest in Puyallup, WA last weekend.

The rep. had a broad array of their VW-specific publications there,
including some of their CD-ROMS of repair manuals.  Apparently they intend
to publish the CD-ROMS for most [maybe all] of their traditional manuals.

This is a neat idea, so you can print the pages you need for a project/job
and not worry about flying grease, blood, etc. ruining them.

Has Bentley had a booth at other shows/meets around the country?
