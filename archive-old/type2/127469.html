Subject: Re: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
  these  tires.

&gt; A close fit, that works (personal experience) is a LT 195/75R14 Load Range C

&gt; Note: LT does not always appear on the tire. If it has a &quot;Load Range&quot; rating
&gt; letter, it's a LT (or truck) tire.

Close, but the maximum loads for a given load range are lower for the low
profile 195/75R14 tire.  Since load range C is only rated at 1435 pounds,
you'll need load range D in this size.  Since the 195/75R14 tire is
smaller in diameter your engine will spin faster for a given speed,
something hardly needed in a bus!  Tire shops will often try to sell the
195/75R14 size to customers, since they usually have that size in stock
and they don't like to special-order tires.  They'll say that
the 185R14 size is &quot;obsolete&quot; or &quot;superceded&quot;, neither of which is true.

&gt; Nowhere in the owner's manual did I find any reference to &quot;maximum load.&quot;
&gt; Maybe there is a reference in the &quot;Campmobile&quot; supplement.
&gt;
&gt; This is not to say it did not exist in manuals from other years/regions, but
&gt; it isn't in mine, and I suspect it hasn't been since the vans were equipped
&gt; with radials when new (1971).

My '71 manual specifies a maximum load of 1520 pounds.

 It isn't likely you'll find LT tires in the
&gt; load range of C that do not meet the &quot;maximum load&quot; required of this
&gt; vehicle,

Actually, since the maximum load varies with the size, the load range
alone is no guarantee of suitability.

&gt; &quot;...The maximum load capacity... added to the weight of the vehicle, must
&gt; never exceed the total load capacity of the four tires (marked on their
&gt; sidewalls.&quot;
&gt; For my '79 Kombi (the Kombi has the greatest GVW, not the campmobile), that
&gt; works out to 5070 lbs. (ACK! Two and a half TONS?) divided by four tires is
&gt; 1267.5 lbs.

Be careful, the rear axle carries more than half the weight of the bus!
Note that the front pressure is constant at 30PSI regardless of load, but
the rear pressure can be as high as 44PSI, indicating that the rear
wheels are carrying significantly more load than the fronts.  If only 200
pounds of the evenly-distributed weight of 1267 pounds is shifted to the
back you end up with 1067 on the front wheels and 1467 pounds on the
rears, over the max load of the 195/75R14 load range C tire and
approaching the specified maximum load of the 185R14 load range C tire.

German engineers don't tend to overspecify things like American engineers,
as they expect the vehicle's users to adhere to their recommendations.
