Subject: Look in the Tall grass

I was out the door early this morning to jaunt over to Moncton to pick
up a complete front-end from a '65 bus.  On the way there -a road I
have travelled many times- I passed an old petrol station, long since
closed.  Passing the station in itself is no big deal...it has been
there since the 40's, however the 6' fence running along behind the
station had been recently torn down...this caught my attention.
Through the opening now revealed, I thought I saw that familiar shape
sitting beyond the now missing fence...mental note to myself to stop
on the way back.

In Moncton, I picked up the front-end...and it was complete:  Steering
knuckles, kingping, spindles, brakes &amp; drums [with new wheel
cylinders, bearings and races]...all painted a bright blue :-|.  [It
was destined for the front-end of a 450-equipped Beetle dragster, but
they owner opted for something else].  Picked up a few other odds and
ends [found an air-cleaner and BN4 in junker Thing...but the owner
wouldn't part with them], loaded the pickup and headed home.

Arriving at the old garage, I stopped.  I got out and looked around
for the obligatory &quot;bad-ass&quot; dog, but couldn't find it...saw the dog
house, but no dog.  I wadded back into the field behind the garage and
there was a splittie peeping over the out-of-control hay.

I managed to crawl around a while before the owner [who must have been
80 if a day] came wandering back.  He was the second owner, bought it
in 1965, toured the Maritime provinces for a couple of summers and
parked it.  I looked at the plate...sure enough 1967...the bus has
been parked in this spot for 30 years!!!

Someone had gotten to it at one point, as the church-key sockets were
missing from the back hatch and engine lid, but the gas door cover was
in tact.  The rear suspension was bottomed out on the frame and the
whole bus was sitting about 4-5&quot; off the ground [tyres flat of
course].  The rockers and lower front edge of the nose are shot [from
sitting in the grass all these years], the lip under the front windows
is very rusty, but the rest doesn't look too bad [paint is peeling off
in strips]. 

This was obviously a panel converted into a camper [included adding
windows to each door and one on the driver's side] 

When I reached into the engine compartment to wipe off the id-tag, my
arm brushed against the fan belt which disintegrated.  The plate
reads:

Typ 211

07 06 0        628 06x [could not read last digit of chassis number]


&gt;From what I can tell, this would put this bus around June/July 1960.

I cannot tell if the frame is too badly gone to restore.  The fact
that the torsion bar seems to have let go is a little troublesome.
That couple with the fact that it has been parked in a field for 30
years [the tyres are from a company that has been defunct for over 20
years ;)]  In any case, it will either be a lot of bending and welding
to get this on the road....or lotsa parts to fill the garage.

The fellow also said that he had been offered 1500$ for it, but didn't
sell [this made start to suspect that he was senile]...but it turned
out that the offer was made in 1976.  I told him that I prolly would
have offered 1500 in '76, but he would be lucky if I offered him more
than $200 now...if the frame wasn't beyond repair...otherwise, I
offered to tow it away for nothing.

I told him that I would be back with some lumber, a couple of jacks,
blocks and a friend and that we would get it up out of the grass...I
will then look under and make an offer.

Tom, Clara...anyone...please send I an assessment and some key points
which I can use to determine the &quot;walk away&quot; threshold [my experience
with pre-64 buses is limited].  Also, I am still working on another
old farmer for a '62 clamshell...but you know how it is ...they must
be saved ;) 

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh my!

Roy

BTW:  It has what appears to be an old Stewart-Warner heater under the
parcel shelf....
