Subject: Re: Oil Level

Hey Now --
I've had my '79 bus for over three years now, and the oil level thing
&gt;&gt;still&lt;&lt; throws me off guard and always makes me wonder how much oil is
actually in there.  But, I've gotten used to it and learned that the oil
level is incredibly sensitive to where you park.  What looks like a level
parking area may actually be off slightly enough to make a drastic
difference on the dipstick.  (This is especially vexing here in Portland,
OR because most of the streets are crowned in the middle for water runoff,
and an accurate reading away from home is pretty much impossible due to a
constantly-leaning bus.)  Whenever I change my oil, after putting in the
exact appropriate amount and having it read perfectly on the dipstick, I
can always expect to go to the nearest gas station and find a totally
different reading 30 minutes later.  (You would think think that gas
stations might have level fueling areas...)  Anyway, I would say just make
a habit of checking your oil at the same place where you do your oil
changes - that way you know where the reading is supposed to be on the
dipstick after putting in your 3.75 qts (or whatever it is for '69s), and
you always know when you have too much or need to add.  When on the road
and needing to check the oil, the best you can do is get to the most level
place you can and use the reading as a ballpark.
