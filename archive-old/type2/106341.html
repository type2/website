Subject: Re: [T2] Guages? What to buy???

The first is.. I was under the impression
&gt;that you measure the temperature of the air cooler motor by the temperature
&gt;of the oil, correct? Well on BUS DEPOT they seel a &quot;Cyl Head Temperature
&gt;Sensor&quot; which measures the temperature of the cyl head. What's the
&gt;difference? Do I need both?

The way I understand it, the CHT gauge will tell you if you are running lean but you don't really know unless you look at the oil temperature gauge and see that it's normal and CHT gauge is not.

&gt;My next question is... I'm not sure exactly what guages my car was supposed
&gt;to have STOCK. When I look at the gauges (from memory now) the two that
&gt;stand out are the one LARGE guage in the center. THat guage displays the
&gt;speed of the car, but it also has the turn signal lights in it, AND... it
&gt;has the fuel guage in it.

Looks like this (the clock is optional):

The gauges are grey on earlier models but the layout is the  same.

&gt;I don't think I need a fuel pressure guage, or a vacuum guage.

Not vital.

&gt;I would LIKE to have a guage displaying the voltage, an oil pressure
&gt;guage, fuel guage, tachometer, speedometer, and the oil temperature guage.

That sounds good.
