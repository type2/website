Subject: Re: [T2] Can I borrow a backyard in Bellingham, WA?

I don't think the money would be so much a problem as the other logistics..
Where to put it all, how much time to get it out, who gets what (best to
draw lots which are exchangeable), who does all the work, and getting enough
people there to deal with it.
