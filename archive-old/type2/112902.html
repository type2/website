Subject: Re: [T2] Travel Prep/Fridge reactivation

Thanks for the advice.
I had been reading up on spec sheets , b ut had not seen that it takes a 
full 3 days to reactivate.
So are you saying that even if it has been sitting unused for a long 
time, the ammonia will still &quot;wake up&quot; for us?
Thanks!

&gt; All of the wiring seems to trace out alright, but there is no action
&gt; when I flip the switch. The unit has not been run in awhile (I don't
&gt; think the previous owner used it in  the 3 0r 4 years he owned it). I am
&gt; thinking I'll simply tear it out and replace with a new, 12V cooler,
&gt; unless someone has some idea of  a trick I am missing.

&gt;
&gt;Whoa!!!  Before you tear it out. It is an ammonia fridge. All it does is heat up one end and this causes the
&gt;other end to freeze. It has no moving parts, it makes no noise! Under the door with the grille on top is the
&gt;temp control for 110v. The heater ONLY runs on 12v. If you do not have an aux battery it will only work with
&gt;110v plugged in to your house. Plug it in, turn it on to City Power, turn the knob full cold and let it sit
&gt;for 3 days. The ammonia gels. This will wake it up.
&gt;The aux battery is ONLY to be used to maintain the temp while driving, not when you are parked. It will
&gt;totally flatten the battery in 6 hours. When you are parked, use 110.
&gt;
&gt;This fridge does work and it will make ice cubes. The 12v coolers are junk. They will only bring the temp down
&gt;40 degrees below ambient temp. On a 105 degree day, that is only 65 degrees!
