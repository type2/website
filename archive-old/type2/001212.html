Hello I am new to the list and have a weird problem with my Starter. If the
Battery is not fully Charged sometimes the starter will stick in the on
position and will not stop turning over unless the motor starts. Anyone else
have this problem before. I usually have to run to the back and unhook the
Battery cable.
Also about disconnecting the negative ground wire first and reconnecting
last. I was hooking up my battery one day and hooked up the positive cable
then the negative like you are suppose to. Then decided to tighten up the
positive terminal a bit more. I was reaching in with my left hand using a
socket wrech and touched it to a part of the body. My Wedding ring burned a
ring around my finger about and 1/8th of an inch deep. I still have a nice
scare 7 years later. Word of advice take off any jewelry before working on
your car. My ring has a nice gouge out it as a reminder.
Also disconnect the Battery when replacing your Accelerator cable. That one
almost killed me. I was pushing it through from the front and it crossed
over the Tranny and touched the starter. It jump started my bus with me
underneath and it was in gear. The bus rolled right over the top of me.
Luckly I didn't have a leg or an arm sticking out the side. Take it out of
gear when working on your bus.
Hope this provided a few chuckles and a few reminders
My VW's Scariest moments.  Any one else have any horror stories.
