Hey all

Just wondering if anyone has used electronic ignition in a FI 
2.0L engine?  I'm thinking of putting it in.  Any reasons not 
too?  Any kits to stay away from?  Any happy customers?

Thanks

My '79 FI 2.0 liter engine has a Pertronix Ignitor (Hall cell 
technology) in place of the points and condensor, inside the 
stock '79 distributor.  Works great.  Cost about $50 plus 
shipping.  Don't even have to *think* about the timing or dwell. 
(Dwell is a steady 58 degrees, timing is 7.5 degrees BTDC.)
