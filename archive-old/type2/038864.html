There is not a very simple solution. If the key is on there is power to
the coil..
You could wire in a switch to a hot wire but you may as well just remember
to shut off the radio. I can think of a few other ways to do it but all
would require you to remember to shut something off to kill the circuit to
the radio completely. 
The only alternative I see would be a timed circuit that would shut off
after some time. You could build one pretty easily with a 555 timer and a
relay or you could probably find a timed relay in a big electronics
catalog.
