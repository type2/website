Chris,

I, too, think that was the Bulley-Hewitt bus. I did not save a copy, but
remember going back and forth from the SAMBA to the Bulley-hewitt site at
the time.

After $8K in rust repair and paint, that is exactly what I want to avoid.
I know from my own experiences that to avoid rust you have to avoid
trapping water.  Don't let it in and when it gets in, DO let it drain. I
want insulation that I can be sure will not collapse into the bottom of
the cavity and collect moisture.  The cheap ceiling tiles are made of a
stiffened fiberglass with a cheap vinyl sheet glued to the face.  Peal off
that sheet and you have a stiff insulation panel you can glue in place.
I may conduct a test or two to be sure that whatever the stiffening
substance is that it does not wash out.
