&gt; hi all
&gt; 
&gt; what is a good solvent for cleaning oil/grease off of and out of a case
&gt; and/or engine parts?  i have my engine almost completely disassembled, but

I have a tub that is big enough to put one half of a case into but I 
would suppose a barrel with enough solvent or kerosene would loosen the 
grime.  I know a lot of auto shops have soak tanks around here and 
they'll charge a small fee to soak it.  It's very much worth it to search 
this out.  I've also went down to the local spray and wash and put the 
nozzle on engine clean, and sprayed away.  Be prepared though because the 
power of the sprayers shoots water *EVERYWHERE*.  I usually come out of 
it drenched pretty bad.  I don't think the owners like this but I figure 
what's the difference?  My engine is out of the car instead of in it. :-)

Hope this helps...
