Yes, indeed, send it, not because I might actually do the motor assembly
for a VW client, because my maschinist has the process down pat, so he can
give a solid product at less time/money than I can. But I do love
constructed algorythms (working your ass off to make iterative tasks easier
and most certain, if the data you put in is real), via spreadsheet or
otherwise. And I will do my own motor assembly if and when I need one for
my T-II which maintains stock compression specs. I'd like to enhance that
one the same way I did my 912. Quick shim selection from actual measures
will be sweet.

Now it your machinist is not fully familiar with VW air cooled motors, that
spreadsheet indeed will give him an essential tool. Make sure he gets it.
Get his measures and plug them in. See that your results confirm his,
before you order the correct shims. 

Thanks,

&gt;Great thing to give to your mechanic : )
&gt;P-Mail me and I'll send it to you.
