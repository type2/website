Subject: RE: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

&gt; My first post to this list, and unfortunately not a happy
&gt; one! Just bought an '83 air cooled Westfalia, which was to be
&gt; my summer camp-mobile - I stupidly didn't get it inspected
&gt; before purchase, and am now stuck with an engine with 0
&gt; compression in one of the cylinders.


I must admit not having read the entire thread, but I will say this: Out of
maybe 20 busses I've fixed up over the years that had low compression in
just one cylinder (and good compression in the other 3), in all but one case
the culprit was a dropped valve seat, a very common failure. In three of
those cases, the piston had been damaged when the valve seat dropped, which
was fairly evident as soon as the head was pulled. In the rest of the cases,
simply replacing the cylinder head solved the problem. The AVP heads that we
sell use specially designed valve seats that are far more resistant to this
common failure than the stock design.  Neither your local mechanic or
machine shop, most other rebuilders, or even new heads will use this design,
so I would recommend only using AVP heads. At slightly over $200 they're
fairly reasonably priced as well. (Or of course these heads are also used on
AVP's rebuilt engines, if you happen to need one, but let's hope not.)
