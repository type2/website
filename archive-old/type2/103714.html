&gt; I know what you mean.  any 68-72 bumpers that I have found have been
&gt; badly beat up or horribly over priced.  I kinda planned to get a nice
&gt; set of nice chromed 73-79 bumpers for my 72 after i get all the
&gt; mechanical stuff done first.  I'm sure the experts will reccomend
&gt; cutting off the front clip of a 73-79 and welding it in to mount the
&gt; bumper on or something like that.  What I planned on doing was one of
&gt; two things.  since the early bumpers were rounded and the holes were
&gt; slightly twards the top of the bumper the brackets are angled upwards
&gt; slightly, if you just drilled new holes in the late pumper and bolted
&gt; it on it would be at an angle so I was going to either put washers on
&gt; the outermost bolt on the bumper bracket to lower it slightly, or
&gt; putting a wedge type shim of wood or metal on the bolt between the

if you use a shim make sure that the wedge is of a materiel that is at
least as strong as the bumper braket,  if not, you could have an accident
and the wedge collapses and the other vehicles bumper rides up the now
angled bumper and into the passenger compartment
