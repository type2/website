Subject: Oil Leak
Message-Id: &lt;l03130322b36f714a6bd4_at_[206.168.69.56]&gt;

Hey all,

Stats:  '71 Riviera Conversion, 1600 dp with about 25k on rebuild, 009
dizzy.  Quasi-Daily Driver, some rust here and there, owned for 4 years.

Just started losing pretty good quantities of oil from what looks like my
main seal. Only when the engine is good and warm. Bus would leak a drop or
two (just marking its spot) all along, but now its a good steady drip, a
pint every 50 miles.

Question:  any deeper cause I should look into?  Do these seals just give
up the ghost over nite?   Any way to retorque something?  Other things I
should look at?  Finally, though I have driven these critters for more than
10 years and have had three busses, I have never had to drop an engine.
Any tips for a ez main seal replacement?

On a different subject:  the company I work for, Jade Mountain, sells all
kinds of bus friendly products.  One thing:

&gt; Well, we DID go to Fla (Key West, ) in August of 96 in the 78 Westy
and
&gt; survived....the fans I put in the bus (Caframo) helped a lot, one
aiming at
&gt; each person (I glued plexiglass to the cabinet top and stuck the
suction
&gt; cups to that)......but Caframo went from a quality motor built in
Canada
&gt; that DID NOT cause TV interference that I still use after 8 years to
one
&gt; made in China

We sell 12volt fans from Germany that are marketed for the Yachting crowd.
Quiet, tough, and fit with the VW motiff.  5&quot;, 500 cfm, $39, 6&quot; 750 cfm,
$84.

Also, small compact evaporative coolers that are built into those
rubbermaid file boxes, Dual Kool 200 cfm$245, Tri-Kool 300 cfm $325.

Solar Panels, Inverters, Sun Showers, 12volt pumps, lights,
etc.........Mention the list and talk to me at extension 112 and I'll cut
you a deal.  (I don't work on commission, so this is not quite a shameless
plug) 1-800-442-1972, www.jademountain_dot_com

I'm on digest so reply to me........

Thanks!
