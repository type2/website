&gt; &gt;Beat on this thread a little more, saw today where Sears has

&gt; 1380
&gt; seems a bit low but the max inflation is correct.

Low profile tires tend to have lower load capacities for a given load
range.  I think that this has to do with the carcass having to hold a
&quot;squarish&quot; shape with a wide flat tread as opposed to the &quot;rounder&quot;
cross-section of the taller tires.  More of the structural strength of
the carcass goes to maintaining the tire's shape which leaves less to
support the load.

1380 pounds is quite low.  In fact, it is lower than the 185R14
standard load tires that are so universally derided for poor handling
and throwing treads.  If you are going to run 195-75s please be safe
and run load range D tires!
