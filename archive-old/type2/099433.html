Subject: Re: [T2] smelling gas

&gt;I have a '79 bus with an '75 1800 engine in it.  The 1800 has a Weber 
&gt;Progressive on it - installed by PO.
&gt;
&gt;I park the bus the garage.  In the mornings, or anytime it sits for a 
&gt;while inside the garage, I smell gas.  I have been over the fuel lines and 
&gt;found no leaks.  Based on what I've read here I purchased new VW fuel 
&gt;lines and replaced the ones one the bus.  Still get the gas smell.
&gt;
&gt;I've had two suggestion as to the cause; 1) the Weber is leaking fuel 
&gt;after the engine is shut off , or 2) the breather valve on the gas tank is 
&gt;stuck open and get the fumes that way.
&gt;
&gt;What do you all think?  Any of these sound right or have any other 
&gt;suggestions.

You have a carb (any regular carb is going to) with a fuel bowl vent open 
to the atmosphere and this is allowing the fuel smell to permeate the 
garage. This is one reason that the cars of the eighties first tried those 
computer controlled carbs and then were forced to go to fuel injection.

The carbs of the eighties had a valve that closed the fuel bowl when the 
engine is off. This was a smog prevention thing.

You say you have checked all the fuel lines but have you checked all the 
vent lines?

If you want to do a test - pull the van into the garage and remove the air 
cleaner. Cover the carb throat with some plastic (plastic with a rubber 
band to hold to the carb?). Seal it up. Then if the rest of the system is 
okay you should notice a big difference in the gas smell in the morning.

Lastly I would also seriously inspect the carb to make sure that the float 
is set right and the carb bowl vent isn't spilling gasoline into the carb 
throat which might cause alot of smell. Does the engine act like it is 
flooded and require the gas pedal to be on the floor before the engine will 
start?

Is the charcoal canister set up properly with all it's hoses?

Just my 2 cents.
