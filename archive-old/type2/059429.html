Subject: Sunroof and Computer dump
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

First, a big thank you to all the list members who are helping me in my
search for a new bus. I was going to respond to each of you individually but
my computer took a big dump this weekend and I lost all my saved mail (along
with a lot of other stuff).
Secondly, has anyone ever removed a pop-top and fitted a sun-roof in the
opening, either stock or after-market? Is it possible?Anyone know a company
that makes a kit for this? Just a thought. TIA TBear
