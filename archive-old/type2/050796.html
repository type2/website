I second that motion. The headlight switch is also a rheostat that controls the ammount of voltage to the dash lights. It should turn clockwise and stop at its brightest setting. Sometimes they just turn and turn and there will be one sweet spot where you will get the dash lights to come on. 

Please note that replacement switches do not have the tab to power the parking light indicator. You can run that on the clock tab if you do not have a clock and it will simply be on all the time when the headlights are on.

I'm thinking it could also be the
dimmer circuit in the light-switch -- those pots get dirty stop functioning
if you're not careful.

let us know what you find out, too!
