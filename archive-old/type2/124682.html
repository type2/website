Subject: Bad Coil and Pertronix?

&gt; how the coil should be wired? I got a little frustrated and started 
&gt; playing.

Be careful. A friend just blew his electronic ignition by hooking the wires 
up wrong. I don't know what brand it was, but his was very sensitive to 
mis-wiring, and the instructions warned as much.
