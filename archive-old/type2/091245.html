If the engine needs pulling for other reasons, it is certainly the best
way to go.  However, even with the engine on the floor I'd remove the
generator without lifting the shroud.  Pulling the shroud
around the oil cooler and
getting it back in place exactly right is more difficult than the
generator removal itself!
