Update...

Well... she's been at the mechanics for almost 2 weeks now... they have
found nothing so far.  They're telling me that there's a 1 milliamp draw and
they can't find it, they're down to unplugging circuits one by one trying to
find it... argh.  It's driving me nuts, at least when it was here I could
mess with it myself, but having it be there so long is really starting to
worry me...  I hope they find SOMETHING, I mean what are my options if they
can't find anything?

&gt;Whelp, as I said, switch is out, charger is out, new lighter installed,
&gt;radio is disconnected... all extraneous equipment removed... I jumped her
&gt;this morning and she started right up, drove around running errands all
day,
&gt;stopped and started her, (she started right up again) parked her about 5
&gt;hours ago and her battery is already dead again...
&gt;
&gt;I think it's time I brought her to the mechanics... sigh...
