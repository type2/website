Subject: Re: automatic trans/FI/ and a dead battery

Drew -
I have jump started my '80 zillions of times.  Didn't say what year 
yours was.  Earlier FI might be more intolerant.  If in doubt, use a 
car with a proven good battery and do NOT have other car's engine 
running.  Running other car provides over voltage due to it's 
attempts to charge your bus's battery.  Leave the other engine off 
and you get just the standard voltage.  This could lead to 
discharging the other car's battery if the bus has to be started lots 
and lots of times, though.  If at all possible invest in a battery 
charger, they are not too expensive.  Cheaper ones work slower, but 
they still do the job.

&gt; Ok so in the Muir book it says not to jump a FI engine b/c of over 
&gt; voltage to the 'brain' causing damge (expensive damage from what i hear) 
&gt; So if i have an auto trans, ie no popping the clutch to start, and i find 
&gt; myself with a dead battery...what do i do?  am i just plain screwed??

BTW, just be glad you aren't on the Dr Who list.  I could only take 
300 messages a day for a couple of days.  And 300 was one of the slow 
days!
