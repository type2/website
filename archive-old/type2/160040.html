Subject: Re: [T2] Homeland Security Chief Warns of Bus-bomb Threat

The only problem with using our buses as weapons of mass destruction is
that the weight of explosives (diesel fuel &amp; fertilizer, plastique, C4,
whatever...) would require the objective to be located in a downhill
trajectory.  This severely limits the viability of the weapon on many
likely targets.
