Subject: lost 3rd and 4th gear 

so, after 8 years of college, I started moving my stuff
back home for a brief respite before I become a slave to
da man.

On the way home, I downshifted going through a small town.
That was the last I saw of 3rd and 4th gear.
 
When I try to go into 4th, I just get 2nd again.

I'm assuming that something came loose
on the linkage and that it's not rotating correctly?

Anyone have other ideas?  I'm not ultra enthusiastic
about major mechanical repairs at this point and time  &lt;grin&gt;


thanks all

matt
