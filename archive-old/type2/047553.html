Subject: [T2] cooling a 1500 in a bus.

Ok. For the time being this 1500 is gonna go in my '74 bus (when i'm
finished
working with it). This is a 1500 out of a '67 bug (i think).
My question is does anyone have any good methods on how to cool this
thing. I'm planning to make engine tin that will sit uder the fan and go
out to where the engine seal normally goes (just like the tin in a
pankake). And I got some &quot;kool tin&quot; as well. However the air flow in a bus
is quite different than in a beetle. The way the 1500 works is that the
belt pully has a fan on it that sucks air into another fan that blows it
at the cylinders and to the generator (etc) through a thick steel
housing. How should I go about doing this as efficently as possible?

Thanks,
