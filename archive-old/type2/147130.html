Yes, Jim, I'm close, I'm on the Island in Nanaimo. You live in god's country
 I travel to Oregon at least once a year, just to see the beauty.

Take care,
Courtney

&gt; Has anyone ever come across a cheaply priced headlight aimer like you
&gt; used to see in the old days at any garage. They would suction cup it
&gt; on to your headlight then adjust your headlight to the correct specs??
&gt; All the ones I see are 1000's of dollars!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
