&gt; Ahem... Less that $15 at your local *REAL* FriendlyLAPS. 0-60 # gauge,

&gt; an appropriately sized worm screw clamp. If you can sell 'em for $60,

Jim,

The carb fuel pressure testers are in the $15 range, and go from 0-10PSI
The FI fuel pressure testers are a different beast and are far pricier,
but cover 0-60/100 psi.  I have seen them on sale for as cheap as $40, but
I would expect to pay $50-60 on an average day.  If you can find an FI
gauge for $15, tho... let me know!!!!
