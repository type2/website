Esteemed List,

.............._dot_can I find steel fuel line?  Now I know that non-VW auto parts 
stores sell small segments of fuel line which has been set up with flares and 
hardware.  But what I'm looking for is regular old steel fuel tubing.  About 
six uninterrupted feet of it.  Absolutely nobody I've talked to (including 
pipe and tubing suppliers!) has the slightest idea of where to pick up an 
item like this.  This stuff can't be extinct, can it?
