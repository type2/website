Subject: Kit: T4 transplant to T1 bus/bug/ghia/whatever

     Buddy of mine sent this my way. Kind of the opposite of our usual 
thread, but just in case some type 1'er out there wants to have a bus 
that actually *goes* when you push the gas pedal to the floor... Note 
that you may want to beef up the brakes with something like this-at least 
on the pre-71 models. Then again, maybe not...

Usual disclaimers apply-I don't know 'em, don't make money from 'em, 
don't have one, and wash my hands after handling red meat products...


Peace,
