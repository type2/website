Subject: Re: Air Conditioning

&gt;As I was driving around earlier (116* today) I was wondering if any later 
&gt;model &quot;loafs&quot;  ('72-'79) ever had Air Conditioners.
&gt;
&gt;If they did, are they effective?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone ever tried to retrofit one?

The PO of my '76 DC gave me an air conditioner along with a pile of other 
things stuffed in the back bed. To be honest it looks a bit hacked up, 
but that's just a quick observation. But, he *did* say that it was 
original VW equipment.

It looks like it fits along the entire length of the underside of the 
dash, and that you run the compressor straight off the alternator? (I 
dunno, a second belt? Dave any ideas?). I'd be interested in hearing how 
Dave does with his in Tejas. Course, I might be more interested in just 
parting it out cause of the wonderful temperate climate here in the SF 
Bay Area.

Cheers,

Bren
