&gt; it's true that you started the thread, and there's an entirely
&gt; different question involving you. I speak for a lot of people when I
&gt; say that you should make sure you've mastered the skill of setting your
&gt; bus safely securely on jackstands, so as not to kill yourself, before
&gt; you start talking about engine swaps. Especially in earthquake country.

No need to get mean. :-^

Funny thing is that I've been under cars that I've put on stands that
have been hit while I was under them with no ill effects other than a
heart attack. When my bus came down, it was on stands, with wheels
chocked and all.

Needless to say I'll be using many more chocks and stands in the future. LoL!
