&gt; etc? Should I just be thinking about a long block from a rep. dealer that

you have to make the call. As far ar what they use, that seems (to me
at least) to be the source of most of their engine failures. The
reports I have read to the list on failure analysis, usually include
mismatched parts, parts out of spec, and on and on. There have been a
few isolated cases of a gex engine having a full life, but these are
not the norm. 

What you do with the engine depends on where you are planning to drive
the bus. If you try and use it for camping on &gt;100miles trips I would
ditch that gex asap and look for a local rebuilder, rebuild it
yourself, or look for a good internet rebuilder. If just around town,
I would personally put aside enough money to get a tow truck back to
home and run it into the ground while saving for the engine.
