Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd: Re: [WetWesties] Synthetic oil

I have used Mobil 1 in my VW's, Hondas, Corvairs, motorcycles, lawnmower. Good stuff. Tends to weep around some of the gaskets and I don't know if the seal shrinks, smaller molecules, thinner oil (not according to the label), or what. ALL of those were mentioned as causes in the internet reading I did. In the end I replaced a few cheap gaskets and life was leak free.
