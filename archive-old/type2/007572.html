Subject: re: oil temp...

Jack and List,

My oil temp sending unit is attached to a &quot;T&quot; fitting (as is the oil
pressure sender) and located where the aforementioned oil pressure
sender was located.

In a sense, you've proven my point; since Kate (the fellow bus owner
in Portland, Or. with all the overheating/poor running problems) never
mentioned where her temp sensor was located. Therefore, without this
knowledge anyone saying 225 degrees Fahrenheit is too hot was
meaningless! 

As all of us who have oil/cylinder temp gauges (and who've been on the
list long enough to've seen this same thread at least a 1,000 times)
know, there IS NO Holy Grail when it comes to operating temps.... 

They're all RELATIVE!!! To the way you drive, where you live, Poptop
Westy with full camping options VS. station wagon, the phase of the
moon when your bus was given it's life, Monica or Hillary, Democrat
VS. Republican, etc., etc., etc.

Seriously though, it would be great if someone developed a test for
our gauges/sending units so we could calibrate them, or at least be
speaking in some meaningful dialogue when comparing temps. At one time
I recommended using boiling water, but someone on the list mentioned
that water boils at different temps depending on the altitude! Any
better ideas?

&gt; &gt;I'd have to agree with Ken Hooper on this one. While Dave Easterwood
&gt; &gt;is correct in saying that a typeI *SHOULD* run between 185 and 210,
&gt; &gt;the reality (at least for most of us) is that it runs substantially
&gt; &gt;hotter. Just ask any of my fellow Arizona bus driving brethren!!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My '69 poptop Westy runs at around 225 on the highway. This is normal
&gt; &gt;for MY bus and it has all the cooling fins/ducts/tin/engine
&gt; &gt;seals/etc., etc. in place and operating properly. Yes, this is a
tired
&gt; &gt;motor, but certainly not shot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It actually got to 260 while my wife, 3 cats and I (and a full load
of
&gt; &gt;camping equipment) drove through Death Valley last summer!!! It was
&gt; &gt;117 degrees (yes, that's FAHRENHEIT, folks!!!) outside and pulling
&gt; &gt;over to let the engine cool was not an option, so I pressed on.
&gt; &gt;Changed the oil in Las Vegas and she's been fine ever since. Yes, the
&gt; &gt;oil was cooked and we all know what that means, but after 4 hours of
&gt; &gt;driving at that temp, the motor is still fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Let's not forget that temp senders located in different areas on the
&gt; &gt;same motor will vary greatly in readings while we're at it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Jaime:  It would help if you could tell us where your sensor is
located.
