Hello,
I'm new to this mail list and to the Volkswagen phenom. I've just =
purchased a '78 Westfalia and am picking it up next week. My wife and I =
fly to Denver from our home in Michigan and will meander our way back =
home slowly. My question is; are there any interesting places to go or =
see on our way back? We have four daze to make the trip and have =
considered Memphis, Santa Fe, and St. Louis. Any help from people who've =
made this trip or lives somewhere in between would be greatly =
appreciated. FYI, I've purchased a new copy of John Muir's book and a =
good road atlas. Hopefully, I won't need the former. Oh yeah, I love =
this list and you all seem like a great bunch of people.
Richard
new '78 Westy (no name yet)
