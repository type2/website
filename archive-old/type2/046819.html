Subject: [T2] Friday Question

Just this week I saw a '79 (?) Westy for sale here on the list for an asking 
price of $8,000.00. Has anyone actually ever sold a bay Westy for this much? 
Has anyone ever paid this (or more) for one. I see a lot advertised for 6, 
7,8 thousand and more, but always wonder if  anyone has actually bought/sold 
one for this much. Just curious.    Jeff S.
