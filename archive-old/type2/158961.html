Subject: Re: [T2] FI to carb conversion

Richard, should you select carbs, I will be the first in a long line to 
eagerly purchase your FI stuff!  FI can adjust itself to all conditions 
for ideal efficiency, while carbs are ideal in only a small range.  FI 
may seem intimidating as there is so much more that could go wrong and 
more to check if something does go wrong- however, I believe FI is more 
reliable as mine is still working after 246,000 mi- what goes wrong 
usually has more to do with aged hose connections (air leaks) than any 
hardware failure.  I only replaced a fuel pump, and that was because it 
ran dry as it was running in the driveway.  Only driving problems I ever 
had were traced to rust-clogged fuel filter, a leaky (cracked) y 
connector to the aux air valve, and a broken points rubbing block.
    It's been a long time, but as I recall, the problems I had in a 71 
were bad/sticking chokes, stuck throttles, clogged jets, broken float 
valve, bad fuel pump diaphragms (leading to all kinds of rich problems, 
hard starting, power problems, gas leaks).  Carbs have mechanical 
linkages that wear or leak.
    If you pay a repair shop, most know the basics of where to look in 
FI if you carry the Bentley manual- and Porsche guys who work on a 914 
will know your FI easily.

BTW Greg, you forgot the most essential tool- a VOM!  (unless that is a 
usual &quot;tune-up tool- but a continuity lamp could work there).  Needed to 
check sensors,  continuity, relays.  Fuel pressure test might be the 
second tool, but one can check volumetric output of the pump/time.
