Subject: Re: [T2] 78 bus engine in a 72

I put a 79 engine in my 74 recently, should apply to a 72 ass well, here is
what I had to do:

-Had to change the fuel tank cause FI has a return line.
-change the flywheel.
-Had to make and weld a mounting bracket to the frame rail for the fuel
pump.
-Transfer the wire harness that goes from the double relay to the starter to
the fuel pump.
-Cut hole for the computer.
-Cut off the breather box mount from the 79 and weld it to the 74 ( measure
twice, weld once!!! ).
-Mount the deceleration valve to the fire wall.
-Mount the double relay to the fire wall.

The hardest things to do was cutting off the breather box mount from the old
van without ruining it, and cutting the hole for the computer.

Joey.
