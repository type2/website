Subject: Re: Brakes

 research on it yet. I use my camper to tow car trailers (up to 1.6
tons) and at times the stock brakes seem to be insufficient for that.
&gt; 

Thats cause they are!! i thought the towing limit on an unbraked trailor
was 1000 pounds!!! well at liest on my 72... no idea about the later
years
