Subject: rear shocks
Mime-Version: 1.0

hello again volks!

i'm about to install new rear shocks that i bought from motorworks.  and i 
have a quick question....

the shocks on the bus now have coils over them (attached to the shock 
itself.)  the new ones that i ordered do not have this spring.  i looked in 
all of my manuals, and i couldn't find a single picture of the shocks with 
a coil over them.

so, what's the deal?  will my new shocks work okay?

thanks!
missy:)
