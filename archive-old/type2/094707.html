Subject: Re: [T2] Busses &amp; NADA

several  years back when my sundance got totalled the insurance 
adjuster told  me exactly how they came up with the value.  Part of the 
value is based on reports on taxes at the state registration office.  
but he said their company only put a ten percent figure on those 
numbers.  20 percent was based on blue book.  the remaining 70 percent 
was on local advertised sales and posted dealer sales.  they then took 
a count  and an average  price.  now on  an older vehicle like our 
buses there arent going to be any dealer  sales  and that state 
reported figure suddenly becomes significant.  Even back  then the 
adjuster mentioned that older vehicles  have problems because of 
reported prices from  the state database.  to many personal sales with  
distorted prices driving down the supposed price.  he said the costly 
but smart thing is to  get an official appraisal yearly and your 
insurance adjusted accordingly.  So if parked  mostly not  bad. If  
daily driver...you  want mercedes insurance, pay mercedes insurance.
