I remember someone saying on this list that Bus Boys had their catalog =
offline for awhile. I can't even land on their site. Does anyone know =
what's going on up there? I ordered a bunch of brake parts, about on =
July 2nd or 3rd, then I went to call them back in the next day or two =
and there was a notice saying they'd be closed for vacation, July 4th to =
14th. Bummer. Well, what can you do? I waited. Now it is the 15th. I'm =
the reasonable sort, but I just got a letter from the city on Saturday. =
I have a van up on jackstands and the city here is on my _at_$$, telling me =
it is an inoperable/abandoned car, a violation of city code, and that I =
will be fined $200 if it isn't corrected by the 22nd...with additional =
possible filing of criminal charges! =3D0(
It looks to me like my order didn't make it out before they went on =
vacation. I don't recall seeing any notice beforehand.=20
Does anyone have their number? I can't seem to get it from directory =
services.    Jan B
