I couldn't guess from your pictures , what year of Vw your driving.
I can speak about the dual carb engines

one thing you can check is your fuel pressure, you can get a Vac/pressure gauge
pretty cheap.
Check the Bentley, but If you have stock dual solex carbs , you want 5psi with
about 400ml delivery in 30 seconds.

You can remove the gaskets on the pump base,, and try it again,, If that
increases your psi , then you have a worn rod.

At the same time, you can check if your tank outlet is plugged.   

If it was electrical,, you should hear a back fire as soon as the power is
restored. 

My guess is you are not getting enough fuel delivery

&gt; back I kept getting this sudden temporary loss of power. It must only last
&gt; about a second as it feels like ive let off of the gas pedal, and then
&gt; pressed back down to resume speed suddenly. maybe the fuel pump is going
&gt; out, and every so often im not getting any gas, so the motor has no power,
&gt; then right back to normal again? It kinda makes the bus jerk forward when it
&gt; kicks back in right away.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on what this could be, and/or things I could check?
