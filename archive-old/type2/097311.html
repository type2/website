Hard to diagnose these things &quot;over the internet.&quot;  If you've got the
ignition set dead on (timing) and are confident that the ignition system is
up to snuff then the next obvious place to look is the fuel system.  If the
van is still fuel injected then my *guess* is that the basic fuel/air
mixture is set too rich.  Symptoms of &quot;too rich&quot; can be: 1) Typically starts
up OK when cold, 2) Typically starts up *hard* when warm, 3) Lack of power,
poor idle.  A too rich situation can come from a variety of causes but
frequent culprits are faulty TempII sensor, leaking injectors, AFM spring
worn out.

&gt; I was traveling and lost power and it was stalling out.
&gt;
&gt; On the advice of the list, I replaced the points, the cap, the plugs
&gt; and cleaned my fuel system (replaced the filter, cleaned the lines).
&gt;
&gt; And she's running like she was when I got her....except, she still
&gt; won't hold an idle.  I have to keep the accelerator down in order to
&gt; start her and she stalls as soon as I remove my foot.  Even when
&gt; cruising at highway speeds, she stalls when I take my foot off the
&gt; gas.
