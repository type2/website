Graham,

Hydraulic lifters first appeared on 1978 buses, but only on the fuel
injected engine AFAIK.  Us poor downtrodden people who don't live in North
America have to adjust them.  FWIW, I quite like having to adjust my valves.
Not for any kinky masochistic reason (I own a bus, it would more likely be
insanity).  Just that it tells you a lot about the health of your engine.

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; On page 431, in the 18th manual (1999 edition), under 
&gt; Tune-ups, John Muir
&gt; mentions that 1972 buses and on, had hydraulically operated 
&gt; valves, meaning
&gt; of course that one doesn't have to manually set the valve 
&gt; clearances...
&gt; however, on page 97, same book, under Procedures for Valve 
&gt; Adjustments, it
&gt; says that 1978 and on buses have non-adjustable hydraulic 
&gt; valves.  Is this a
&gt; typo? Or is this correct?
