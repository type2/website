Find you a good machine shop that is familiar with VW's and have the case 
line bored at the time of rebuild. The bearings are harder than the case 
and the case wears so the bearing wont seat properly after line boring 
oversized bearings are used plus this takes any warpage out the might have 
occured from excess heat. New pistons and jugs are the best way to go the 
jugs wear oval and you have a hard time ever getting the new rings to seat. 
Last but not least pay close attention to the tourqe specs as they are 
critical to much and you pull the studs right out of the case,  good luck

Hey all!
      I was just given (!) a 71 camper bus with lots of spares, including 3
engines, complete with tin, boxes of carbs, pistons, cranks etc. Even a
spare windshield. The bus was apparently a Cal vehicle for most of it's life
so far and is in excellent shape except for driver's floor, battery tray,
etc - the &quot;usual areas&quot;, I suspect.I'm a moderately good mechanic, having
experience on most of my vehicles, including a Corvair (pardon my language),
old Brit bikes and my current other car, a 77 AMC Matador for which I need a
bombproof suit to work on the front springs. Don't ask. Anyway, I've been
reading the list for 2 weeks or so and I have a couple of real basic
questions. First, What have I got? Is it a camper, Westfalia, or what? It
has a fold down rear bench, cooler, closet, sink and provision for outside
electrical connection. No pop top, though.Second - while it appears from
looking at the engine and manuals that a 1600 (that IS what I (should) have,
right?) is a pretty easy rebuild as such things go, am I wrong in thinking
that they don't last all that long? What are some of the other critical
areas to pay attention to? Obviously I have to thoroughly clean all oil
passages and change the bearings and rings, but what else? I do NOT plan on
performance modifications, but anything that will ensure reliability and
longevity are of definite interest.
TIA! Tom
