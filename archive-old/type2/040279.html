Subject: Explain EGR, and some others things...?

This will wound like a silly question to most of you, but what is EGR?
Is it to do with US smog control or something?

I noticed my bay (recent import form Cal.) came with a strange air(?) box,
fitted into the engine bay, (above the battery), that had a feed from the
fan housing and an outlet.
There's also some form of large blower under the front belly pan.
Is this anything specific to US vehicles?
