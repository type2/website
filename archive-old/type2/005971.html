Hey everyone,

I have a '69 campmobile and really want to get a power outlet hooked up inside my bus.

I know it used to have one because there is a hole where It used to be...
But how would I go about doing this?

I think the smartest thing would be to hook it up to a separate battery that I could put under the seat or something, but I also want it to charge back up while I'm driving.

I'm not nearly an electrician, but I know some basics...

Can someone point me in the right direction as to what to do or to any sites out there that may have info on this sort of thing?


Thanks for any help.


-James
