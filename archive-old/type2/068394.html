&gt;back to atlanta in over a year. :(  &lt;and until the olympics leave, i ain't
&gt;GONNA go back!! ... sheesh! the traffic was bad enough before!!!). ;)
&gt;
&gt;

Believe it or not, traffic has been zilch and Buckhead nearly a ghost town.
Same thing happened in L.A. but everyone said &quot;this time it's different.&quot;
You're old enough to know that anytime someone says that, it won't be
different.  The townies have stayed away out of fear of traffic and the
visitors are too beat at the end of a hot day to go whoop it up (excluding
the japs at the Cheetah).Anyway vendors etc. are losing their collective
asses. That may change since the girls gymnastics win has definitely ignited
interest and track starts this weekend.

BTW, when I was at the VW store, there must have been 10 of those multi-hued
(harlequin?) golfs on the front row. IMHO, one is sort of catchy, but 10
ruins any sense of being unique.
