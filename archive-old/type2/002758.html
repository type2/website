&gt;&gt;  ...But be careful about cutting it out.  To pass emissions, some states
&gt;&gt;  require that cars equipped with a catalytic converter have a restrictor
&gt;&gt;  plate (or &quot;bird beak&quot; in the case of our beloved VW's) and test for
this.
&gt;&gt;  In short, if the larger diameter leaded nozzle fits in the fuel filler,
no
&gt;&gt;  emissions certification for you...

&gt;This is the case in CA, I believe. Some 7 years ago I bought a '79 Westy
&gt;that did not have this part. I had to get one and install it to pass smog.

In '95 I installed a '78 bus engine into my '73 chassis.  One of the CA's
requirements for this engine swap was an unleaded fuel restrictor in the
fuel filler neck.  The filler restriction I chose to install was the &quot;Ninja
Star&quot;.

The Ninja Star is a round plate of steel with the restrictor orifice in it's
center and a small spring loaded flap to cover the hole.  Around the
perimeter of this round plate are several sharp points, just like a Ninja
throwing star weapon.  This is forced down the fuel filler neck with a
wooden stick until the points dig into the fuel filler neck and it gets
stuck
there.  (With a little luck, it'll stay put there until you pass the
inspection.
If you're not so lucky, you knock it loose with the gas nozzle and it falls
into the darkness below.)

The other option that the State inspector offered was to cut out the orig
fuel filler pipe and weld in a late model fuel filler pipe.  I used the
Ninja
Star and it passed the CA inspection.
