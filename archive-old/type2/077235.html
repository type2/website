AHA!  OK, as I said, I have not done it.  I gotta try it this way.  I am
usually a big &quot;pull engine and trans together&quot; fan, but that has to do
with my preference for matching the trans to the engine rather than the
engine to the trans.

&gt; &gt; Tom,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What Karl suggests is SOP on the Vanagon engine removal.  I have not tried
&gt; &gt; it on a bay, but I see no reason it would not work.  One thing on the bay,
&gt; &gt; though... do remove the shift rod from the nose of the trans before you
&gt; &gt; swing the trans down!  If you don't, it will really bind on you! You also
&gt; &gt; need to support the bell housing lest it fall on the floor.  A couple 2x4s
&gt; &gt; should do it.
