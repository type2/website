Subject: FI Wiring Harness

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1BFCD.ECE64780

Has anyone redone there main fuel injection wiring harness. Mine on my 78=
, is very brittle it has worn thru the protective sheath while rubbing on=
 intake air distributor. And the wire to the thermo-time switch seems to =
be broken. Can you solder these back together?.  Do you just wrap with el=
ectrical tape ? What is a good material to wrap wires in place of sheath?=
. If I remove harness can I expect more wires to break? It seems like a l=
ot work, but I have not been able to find a new or used harness. A lot of=
 questions but not sure what to do.  =20
