Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner

&gt; question is this: Is there anything special in carb cleaner? Could I use
&gt; another solvent (diesel perhaps)? Also, are there any good resources other
&gt; than the Robert Kuhn article, or any tips for someone who has never opened a

spray carb cleaner has ether in it i think
the can has other less caustic stuff and works a little slower.
but it takes a pretty healthy solvent to dissolve the varnish.. the
deposits survive the gas washing past contiuously.
