Subject: RE: TDC Marker/Ignition Timing Sensor

I've often wondered about how nice it would be to have a little box that
plugs into the ignition circuit and the TDC sensor, with a meter or
something that shows timing, dwell, RPM, whatever else can be gleaned from
the information available.

Maybe a simple go/no go arrangement with LEDs, e.g. -
  RED-  = more than 1/2 degree too retarded
  GREEN = within +/- 1/2 degree of &quot;dead on&quot;
  RED+  = more than 1/2 degree too advanced
Same for dwell but a wider range of angle.

You could even leave it installed in the engine compartment and check your
timing whenever you like.  Or install it on the dash ... maybe that's too
much information though.
If someone does find the spec for the sensor, I might have a go at designing
such a box.
