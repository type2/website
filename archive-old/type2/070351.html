khooper} it's one of those teddy bears, because of their provenance and their

khooper} metaphorical value...

Do people actually know the origin of that bear?

story i was told in at Berkekley  Community Theatre shows in spring 86 was
that there was this guy who went to show dressed like a baby - ie diaper.
   he carried around a teddy bear.    in which he stashed lots of good clean
LSD.    which was liberally distributed amongst the grateful dead extended
family..... inciting them to cavort and frolic like happy smiley teddy
bears..

oh, what a Comes a Time they played then!!

i take no responsiblity for the truth or lack thereof in this story.

this story completely lacks VW content- i didnt even own i VW!
