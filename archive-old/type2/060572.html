I agree.  To have for the sake of having is greed, outright, pure,
unadulterated greed.  Not only that it is not even honorable greed it is
foolish greed.  Get the cars, busses, you can afford, timewise and money wise,
to restore or at least preserve then let others who can restore or preserve
them have the others.  That is the only way we will keep this hobby intact for
our grandchildren.  Those vehicles which rust away are gone forever.  When we
allow that to happen we have done no one a favor except the politicians who
want to destroy us anyway.  Make them do it if it is to be done.  Don't do it
to ourselves.
