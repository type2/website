Subject: Excessive Blow By
Message-ID: &lt;271E797B5E13D1118FC200A0C9499D98B3D921_at_MESSAGE1&gt;

I have a 1974 Microbus with, of course a grab bag of problems.  I went
through the archive and was unable to locate any information that seemed
to suit my main dilema.  
I was driving the Bus to the VWoA headqueaters and all at once I began
to loose power and there was an excessive amount of blow by.  Everyone
kept saying that I had to have thrown a rod - I know what that sounds
like - my engine still sounds perfect - no helicopter rattle - no
cicadas - nothing.  I took it to a shop, and they told me that they
thought I blew a rod.  I took it home and did a compression test and the
3rd cylinder is at 0 psi almost every time (the other cylinders all test
out fine, well with acceptable range).   What can I do to remedy the
situation, I can't afford a new engine or a several hundred dollar
repair bill?  The engine is not the original dual carb model, but a
modified single carb engine.  It had all new spark plugs, distributor
cap, and oil filter but in just the day before everything went wrong -
timing couldn't cause this, could it, the firing order was off for about
30 minutes - we couldn't find the notch in the distributor for awhile
and the pistons were firing in the wrong order.
I am nervous about doing the engine myself but if necessary I will -
what do I look for though?  Does anyone know of any good reference
materials.  

Thank You
