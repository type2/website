Subject: Bus Registered as Rec Vehicle

Are there any compelling reason why I would not want the HapyBus registered
as a rec vehicle?
My wife did the transaction for me, and the Ohio BMV required she
re-register it as a motor home.
I am not happy they did this against my will, but wanted to see if you
thought there was any real negative as to why I wouldn't.

Kind Regards,
