&gt; that is exactally how i mounted the WR-1 i got from bus depot on my 71. the

Well it just fits. The red wire barely makes it to the solenoid because of
the inline fuse but the other wires have enough slack in them. The black
wire has an unprotected connector unlike the original red/black wire at
terminal 50; I might wrap it.

I had to use the rightmost grommet because the ring connector on the red
wire was too large for the other hole.  I checked the screw on the voltage
regulator, it seemed to be a good ground and the bus started.

Next project: upgrading the headlights.
