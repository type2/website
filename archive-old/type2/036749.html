Subject: For Sale or Trade:  Stewart-Warner Heater

This weekend I came into possession of a Stewart Warner Southwind heater,
model 8332, VW number 256-201, which the Type 2 library says was put in
pre-66 buses.  It's a six-volt unit.  The guy I got it from said it worked
when he pulled it from an old bus (then why did he pull it?  Dunno.).  All
the wiring looks good, etc.  It's dusty but in otherwise good shape.

I'm willing to deliver for free to most parts of western Washington, will
ship at your expense to anywhere else.  What will I trade for?  Anything I
can use for my '75 Westy or my '85 Vanagon, such as roof rack, etc.  Maybe
you have an extra canoe and a really cold splitty?

'75 Rustfalia
'85 Vanagon GL
