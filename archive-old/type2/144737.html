Subject: fuel pumps

Hi Guys.  Some of you may remember my rant about the
unreliability of pulse-type electric fuel pumps. 
After a little research, I'm considering a Carter 4070
rotary-style pump.  One site says that all Weber carbs
(single weber on mine) like at least 4 psi of fuel
pressure.  I've been using pulsing pumps that are 1.5
to 3.5 psi.  Is this true?  Is anyone using this or
any other rotary-type pump?  I'm just getting tired of
changing them every year or so.  The Carters are
supposed to be workhorses but the lowest output unit
they make is the 4070 at 4 psi.  Too much?

On a side note, I thought I was going to need an
alternator.  My battery would die after driving with
the lights on all day (rainy last week!).  Come to
find out, when I put the fuel pump on, I accidently
disconnected the voltage regulator.  The fuel pump is
grounded to the screw that holds it on.  What a
relief!  Thanks and cheers....KR
