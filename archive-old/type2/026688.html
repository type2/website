&gt;Question: I know that Muir's book says to label everything you pull off --
&gt;but with what kind of tape???  Between grease and dirt, everything I've
&gt;tried just falls off.  The main thing that terrifies me about doing this is
&gt;the prospect of not being able to piece it together again.  I know it's a
&gt;silly thing, but I'm really curious.  Do you gurus just *know* what hooks
up
&gt;where?  Or do you have some special super-sticky tape?  Or is my engine
&gt;compartment just unconscionably filthy?

I like Rick's idea of the cardboard.  I have some friends that use that
technique.  (Being a clean freak, I clean the parts first but it really
isn't necessary.) I then drop them into little ziplock bags along with a
business card (from my old job) with a description and sometimes a diagram
written on the back side.  May also write assembly order, torque specs, etc.
For larger parts, I use 3M masking tape--not a little piece, but a couple
loops around the part so even if it doesn't stick to the part, it sticks to
itself creating a band on which I write the information.  (Sometimes the
masking tape dries out and tears off, so I think I'll try Rick's idea of
white duct tape.)  However, the big parts are usually obvious, it's the
little screws, nuts, bolts, washers, etc., in the bags that really helps.
The little bags then go into larger bags or boxes based on the subgrouping
of the parts in relation to the whole component.  Sometimes I forget to drop
a card into a little bag, but I can still figure it out later based on the
bigger bag it's in.  Yeah, it takes a little more time, but really saves a
lot more time later when you are trying to reassemble everything.  The bags
in bags in boxes on shelves method also takes up a heck of a lot less space.
