&gt; After further investigation, I think you are smoking crack...they don't
&gt; carry the same name brand items and the prices on the other brands look
&gt; higher to me. For example, the electronic ignition is over $100 at J-bugs
&gt; for a Comp-u-fire brand while the Pertronix at Bus Depot is around $70 plus
&gt; type2 list members get a discount on top of that.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it pays to shop around.

I frequently check the price of the Pertronix and the best deal is 59.95 at
RMMW. I've seen a few similar prices in the VW mags but there's always a
catch like an invoice fee or something just as unpleasant.

I can find many examples where BD has the lowest price and equally as many
where it does not. Please, let's end the debate.
