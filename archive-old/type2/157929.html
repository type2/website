&gt; pulled the wheel, removed the castle nut and tried to pull the drum, won't
&gt; go! Tried heat, vibration everything it won't move. As I said this is my
&gt; first Bus am I missing somthing? Is somthing else holding the drum???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt; 
&gt; What year Bus? Early bays need the &quot;castle (or if you're in Spain, castile)
nut&quot; off to remove the rear drum...Later bays do not but there's a small
(10mm...?-) bolt that locates the drum...
In either case, is there any way to slack off the shoes with the adjusters??
If not, a BFH (Big F'in Hammer) and a block of wood and pound, pound, pound
around the circumference of the drum might loosen it enough to remove the
drum...If not, try sprayin' PB Blaster thru' every hole in the backing plate 
and
hope some gets to the jammed cable/shoe. You might also try slacking off the
hand brake cable at the front of the Bus and spraying Blaster the length of 
the
cables and hope, hope, hope...
Good luck...
