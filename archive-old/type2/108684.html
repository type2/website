Subject: Re: [T2] 78 starter

&gt; &gt;So ... is it possible to buy a new solenoid?

I did this a few years ago. My local VWFLAPS had to order the thing in. By
the time I paid for the solenoid + shipping costs I was like 5 dollars away
from a new starter/solenoid.

Maybe mine is a special case, I dunno. Just thought I'd throw it out there
