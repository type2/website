&gt;Hi all
&gt;Does anyone have a source for brake servos? I looked in my JCW,
&gt;RMMW, MOFOCO catalogs and did not see them listed. HMMMmmmmmmm

I got one about 6 months ago and I THINK it was from RMMW.  I know they
had them in their catalog, but I'm not 100% sure I bought mine from them.
I was getting other brake parts at the time, some from RMMW, some from
Wolfsburg West, and some from NOPI, so it might have been from one of the
other two.  Come to think of it, Wolfsburg West stands out in my mind as
the more likely place I bought from.  At any rate, they were pretty pricey,
$200+ for my '71.
