Subject: Stainless Steel Heat Exchangers (Re: Torque those CVs!)

&gt;holding it on, and came loose, smashing a brand new SSI Stainless
&gt;Steel heat exchanger (~ $500 - why don;t they make those for VW's?)

It's probably wishful thinking, but do the 914 heat exchangers fit VW type
IV engines?  I saw this ad for used SS heat exchangers for a 914--I've
thumbed through Automotion's catalog so I know the SS Porsche exchangers can
go for big $$ new:

PORSCHE 914 EXHAUST MANIFOLD, heat exchangers, 1700-2000 engines, oval exh
ports, 2 sets, 1
stainless, 1 orig equipment steel, both exc cond, $100 each set. (860) 526-5509 

Since I'm more of a pre-71 bus guy, I'm more curious if there are SS
exchangers for off a 956 maybe that might be coerced into fitting a 1600 VW
with stock heads/exhaust.  Has anyone dabbled in the black art of mixing
porsche parts with VW? ;).
