Subject: Re: [T2] Battery full of rain water

Hi Phillip,

If water is laying on top of the battery and it gets mixed with an 
electrolyte (salt, rust or residue from spilled battery acid), it could 
be passing current and slowly draining your battery.

The purity of rainwater varies immensely by location. If you're 
downwind of a major industrial area it can be very acidic, depending 
greatly on the type of industry.

If you live in a wet climate, you may want to consider putting your 
battery in a marine-style battery box to keep it clean. Keeping your 
battery and electrical connections clean is a helpful part of regular 
bus maintenance.

Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; It's possible, but unlikely.  Now if the battery was flooding to
&gt; overflowing and diluting the electrolyte it would certainly harm the
&gt; battery, but this doesn't seem to be the case here.  Since rainwater is
&gt; distilled, it is just the thing for filling batteries!
&gt;
&gt; It is likely that the battery has one or more weak cells, which would
&gt; explain the varience in fill.
