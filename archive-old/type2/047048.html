Subject: Re: [T2] replacment started bush install??? help

I have replaced the rebuilt starter in my '73 twice in the last 120,000
miles without changing the bush.  I believe the bush now has about 200,00
miles on it.  If the old bush still looks OK, why change it?

&gt; A couple of days ago I posted a mail asking for suggestions on how to pull
&gt; out the old starter bushing to install a new one with my replacment
starter.
&gt; My email failed so I didi not get any replies.
&gt; I the mean time I have found an artikle in the library on that .
&gt; but what happens if you do not change the bush?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; thanks
