Subject: Re: [T2] CHT gauge testing

Corbett, the gauge doesnt use voltage, its a thermo couple that uses heat...

the gauge is wired directly to the thermocouple, I would test it by putting
the sender in hot water.....

I think you may have fried the gauge putting voltage to it though...

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I tried switching the leads, but got nothing. I just hooked it up to a
&gt; variable power supply and although it did not go below 1 volt, it did not
move
&gt; the meter at all. I tried several different voltages and nothing. I would
have
&gt; thought that 1 volt would have at least pegged the meter, but it never
moved.
&gt; So I guess it is the gauge and not the sender or maybe both....
