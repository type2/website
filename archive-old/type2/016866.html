&gt; &gt; I can't find that reference on the KEP page, but it might have been
&gt; &gt; for for the watercooled Subaru engine.  The aircooled is a different
&gt; &gt; situation and probably would require higher octane than regular at
&gt; &gt; that compression.  They show the stock type 4 compression at 7.3:1,
&gt; &gt; which sounds much more reasonable.

&gt;        Well, obviously you can get away with more compression in a
&gt; watercooled engine, but they're saying 9 for the wc VW and 9.5 for the wc
&gt; Subaru. So I'd probably go with 8 or 8.5  for an engine like Steve is
&gt; talking about. What the hey, if it pings, burn the 89 octane.
Harmon:
Sorry, I respectfully disagree. I said 8.0 was the upper limit and I
don't mean with regular. Stock is 7.3 and that left a margin of safety
in 1980 when we had higher octane gas. I think 7.5 -7.6 would be the
upper limit with regular. Early 911S's had 8.5 in 72-73 and they needed
premium fuel THEN. (And had a more knock resistant combustion chamber
shape with centrally located spark plug)
No one ever holed a piston from having the CR a few tenths too low, but
many have done the opposite(me, a couple of times).
