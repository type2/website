Okay, I can't keep my mouth shut about this any longer.  The reason the
engine cools in the above condition is that there is a miniscule amount of
fuel entering the combustion chamber.  The spark is not the source of the
heat!  The heat produced is directly proportional to how far your foot is
down on the loud pedal, because that determines how much fuel enters the
combustion chamber, and the more fuel is burned (combustion), the more heat
is produced.

Anyone who thinks that the friction of the rings produces more heat than
combustion, try the following experiment.  After your car has sat overnight
without being run, put your hand on the exhaust manifold near the cylinder
head.  Note the temperature.  Pull the coil wire of your engine and crank
the starter over for 30 seconds.  Get out and put your hand on the exhaust
manifold again.  Notice how the temperature of the manifold has NOT
CHANGED.  You can crank your starter forever and the manifold will never
heat up noticably.  Now put the coil wire back and start the engine.  Let
it idle for 10 seconds.  Shut the engine off and feel the manifold in the
same spot.  Burned your hand, didntcha?  Despite the engine having turned
over about the same number of times, when you added combustion the
temperature skyrocketed.

In case it isn't obvious by now, I strongly believe that combustion
produces the majority of the heat in an engine.  I would bet the ratio of
combustion/friction heat produced is somewhere on the order of 500/1.

If there were no oil in the engine, of course plenty of heat would be
generated by friction in the bearings because you would have metal
contacting metal, but that's not the case.  A thin layer of oil keeps the
surfaces from ever touching, and there is very little friction.  This is
only partially true of the rings, and it still amazes me that the rings are
able to (almost) seal the combustion chamber and not wear out quickly.
Still, I am very sure about combustion being the source of most of the heat
and if someone can convince me otherwise, I'll buy them a nice lunch.
