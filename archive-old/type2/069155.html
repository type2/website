Subject: WTT: Trade my '71/Bay Parts for '67/Split Parts

I don't have my '71 anymore, but I do have some parts that I stashed for
emergencies. If you have some good parts for a '67 bus, I'd be happy to talk
a trade. These are doing nothing but sitting in a box...and I don't expect
to get another '71 anytime soon. These aren't necessarily '71 only parts,
but I'm not sure of other years they might fit.

Here's what I have:

    Item            My Cost
    ----            -------
rear inner bearing    28.70
rear wheel seal        3.94
disc brake pads       11.00
front wheel seal       3.94
front wheel seal       3.94
wheel cylinder kit     4.52
&quot;Bentley Manual       35.49 (only thing in list that's used, but it's not
abused)
clutch cable keeper    8.26
Clutch Cable           7.82

My cost total........ 75.01

I'm not saying I didn't pay too much for some of these. The Bentley, for
example, was a bargain with $12.49 shipping, handling, and insurance tacked
on (now I boycott Latest Rage!)...the clutch cable keeper included $4.00
shipping.

What I'd really like to do is pick up the Bentley for splits...and maybe
something else if your Bentley's worn. But I'm open to other
deals...Christmas is coming, so cash talks too.

I don't need engine parts, but all else splitty is possible...I even need
tires for my '67.

BTW, I've got a spare set of engine tin too, but you'll be more interested
in that next summer ;)

Thanks! Joe
