Subject: continuing electrical woes

thanks to the help of several listees and the Bus Depot, my highbeams 
now work, and my rear flashers and tail lights work too. now onto the 
brake lights. I can't figure out for the life of me what's causing 
this, but they're just completely dead. there are new bulbs. all of 
the ground wire contacts have been brushed clean with a wire brush, 
as have the areas where they connect to the chassis. the positive 
wires on both rear tail lights have had the connectors replaced, and 
the connections on the sockets brushed clean. all fuses are ok, too 
[just put a brand new set in, replacing all the old ones]. still, no 
brake lights.

at this point, the only thing i can think of is that maybe the 
pressure switch on the master cylinder is shot. I've looked in 
bentley and the idiot book, and neither seem to answer this one 
simple question - can i take this switch out and test it without 
bleeding my brakes, or in any way running the possibility of spilling 
brake fluid. bentley only shows the master cylinder in a 
not-on-the-bus state.

I live in a condo, and the trustees are fascists - i'm not  supposed 
to be doing anything on my bus in the parking lot, and i've been 
warned [so now i have the rear of the bus against a fence, so i can 
work with nobody seeing me]. in any case, anything that involves the 
possibility of spilled liquids on the precious pavement, or even the 
perception that liquid may be spilled, is asking for trouble. so, am 
i going to have to take this to a repair shop to have it tested, or 
is it something i can likely do myself with minimal fuss and no mess?

the next house i buy will be a *house* and it will have its own garage.
