Mike the headliner on any car is the underneath part of the roof that you
would see if you look up when your driving in the interior.
In most passenger cars it is made of cloth. In the VW bus it is made up of
vinyl.
However on the Westy (at least all the earlier ones) it is made of a thin
sheet of wood. Mine is a light birch on my 72 and it can deteriorate over
time. You are lucky if your wood is in good condition, hence the instrucions
for replacing it.
You can see pics of my headliner on my website:

&gt; What is a headliner?  I looked in the library and there's a whole
&gt; article on replacing it and I have no idea what it is...
&gt;
&gt; I have a 76 westy.  Do I have one?  :)
&gt;
&gt; just curious!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
