Subject: [T2] Who needs an O2 sensor, cheap?

Hi all:

Get a mailer today for &quot;partsamerica_dot_com&quot; which is really Checker,
Schuck's or Kragen.  They had an &quot;e-Coupon&quot; (WC201)that promises an
additional 15% off.

Anyway, just for grins I looked to see what they had for my '81.  They
had more parts available than I would have thought, though the prices
all looked pretty high.  That is until I looked at the O2 sensors.
They're saying Bosch #11025 Single Wire Universal Oxygen Sensor are
$19.49!  Take 15% off and we're down to $16.57, which is pretty darn
good.  I ordered one, specifying that I'd pick it up at my local store
(no shipping) and with tax it's still only $17.73.

What's really amazing is that about 1 minute after I placed my order I
got a call from the local store.  The message was that they didn't
have a sensor in stock (I know that &quot;online, real-time inventory&quot;
frequently isn't) but that they'd have one tomorrow when I specified
I'd pick it up!  Isn't the internet amazing!

The O2 sensor's at:

+Sensor

Partsamerica may be surprised at how many of these they sell!
