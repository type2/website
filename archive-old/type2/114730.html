Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] wattage use of a laptop (was Auxiliary
  batteries)

I guess that leaving it charging overnight might not be the most 
accurate indicator then. &lt;grin&gt;
The power supply for my iBook reads 65w, which is what I was using for 
reference.
I suppose that is an important point, the various electrics connected 
to the system have their max wattage printed, as does the inverter, not 
the actual draw. There really wont be any way to measure the &quot;lasting 
power&quot; of my battery without observing the charge held by the battery 
and measuring the draw to the peripherals.  Regardless, it will 
obviously have to be more accurate than my current method &lt;grin&gt;.

Steve

&gt; Laptops draw as much as 90 watts when switched on, specially the more 
&gt; recent
&gt; ones.
