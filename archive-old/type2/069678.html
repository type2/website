Subject: Rounded Valve Adjustment Nut ie: Removal of?

      With limited day light last night I adjusted valves 1 and 2. Found out it
was much easier with the car out of gear.  I can be such a loser
sometimes but that is another story. 180 degrees engine sure enough
equalled 90 degrees rotor and so on. Thanks  for the previous help.
      I adjusted the closet valve on driver's side next, #3 and when I got to
the other one (exhaust?) the nut was way tight and I proceeded to round
it.  I am going to pick up a six pronged 14mm socket wrench connector
so I don't strip any more.  I have spare nuts and screws so destroying
the nut and screw is a posibility.  My father has a nut cracker but the
size was too big. Are there crackers small enough for this job. Do I want
to keep rounding it until a 13mm fits. Doesn't seem likely. I remember
seeing a commercial for some gizmo that state &quot;even removes rounded
nuts&quot; Any ideas?  
    Also I have printed out all the posts this week on timing but if any other
recommendation are out there please fire away.  Doing the listening
method may be tough though because what intially prompted this tune up
was my racing engine.
     I will attack that after I finish the valves, do the timing, and check the
plugs.  When I check for a cause of the fast idle  I will be checking the
vacum hose or hoses, decel valve, adjustment screw, and see maybe if
my gas pedal is stuck.  Any other recommendations. 
       Its a great feeling to know that my 1 and 2 valves are adjusted and
the procedure can be done by a compleat idiot, like me.  By the way
when I adjusted the nut on #3 that wasn't rounded, it was pretty loose.
Should I show concern, I never felt as if my engine was hurting for
power?
   Sorry for the semi-long post. Hope everyone has a pleasant weekend
and I truly do appreciate all the responses I have recieved.
