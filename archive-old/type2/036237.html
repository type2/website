Subject: RE: 32/36

Hello

I have a 32/36 DFAV carb Weber.

Its worked 2 year on my engine.  Ive rebuilt the engine, and im looking for
tips to improve my carb.
As i can see, this carb has a choke but its water-activated!!  i presume i
must switch to Manual choke to improve engine performance in cold  season.

Also, any idea if i change the main jet ??

Tx for all
