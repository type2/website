Subject: [T2] engine lift

Hey all, made it safely to the great white north and am now living on 
Vancouver Is, any listies on the Island?

    I'm back in SoCal to fulfill a promise to rebuild a motor for a friend 
and found a solution to that age old problem. That is, I've got the engine 
out and lying on the ground, but its late at night and I've got no one to 
help me lift it to the bench. Harbor frt has a great hydraulic lift table. 
That sucker is just the right height to slide the engine onto, jack that 
puppy up and slide onto the bench. OK at 240$ most of you are probably too 
cheap ; ) but hey as you get old the answer to my back or my money gets 
painfully simple, besides big tools look cool.
    Great to be back on the list even if currently busless. You guys need to 
ride Nikki and get her to make that 69 run.
