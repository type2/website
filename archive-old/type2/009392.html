	On our pickup truck, but before we bought it, a Subaru 360 micro
car and an NSU microcar. Separately. The DPO was a microcar fan. Since we've
owned it, I guess the most extreme would  be a two-layer load of bankers 
boxes filled with my books, and the whole underbed compartment also filled 
with boxes of books AND the passenger side of the cab filled with... books. 
Yeah, well so, I have a lot of books :)

	Fully loaded it ran about 3&quot; lower than normal, I think I was
over the 2000lb cargo rating. But since it's a VW, the load was more
or less centered over the wheels and the handling wasn't that bad. Its
got air-assisted-shocks courtesy of the DPO and I pumped 'em up.!

	Wierdest load I ever rode with was in my family's '68. About '71
my dad took me and my brother to some place in the Puget Sound area where
they process tree trunks into telephone poles. We picked up a bus-load of
shredded tree bark, just filled it from the back seat to the partition.
The middle seat was unbolted and removed, and we's lined it with tarps 
first. Filled it to the windows :)

	The place was a trip- acres of shredded bark - they blast it
off with high presssure water I think - and a big pipe on wheels that
carries it out to the grounds. They roll the pipe to a different spot
every day or every week or something.  Of course the wet bark was decomposing
and if you dug down a couple feet it the heat would make it steam. A couple
more feet down  and it was too hot to touch and would emit smoke.
