Subject: Power Inverter in a 74 Westy question for the electronics wizards 

I have a 74 Westfalia parts vehicle that has a power inverter in it
under the Z-Bed.  It is for converting 110 volts AC to 12 volts DC.  (
I would have thought it to be the other way but after checking out the
wiring and such it is definitely 110 to 12.  My question is can I run
this backwards, meaning 12 volts DC in and get 110 volts AC out?  My
guess is there is some kind of circuits in it to prevent this (I would
think this could be dangerous) but thought I would ask.  If I can't
use it backwards I have no need for it, is there anyone out there
interested in it?  It would need a new battery and is heavy. 
Thanks,
Kevin
