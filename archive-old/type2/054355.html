Subject: Pilot Bearing Removal

I was wondering if you have to remove the flywheel in order to gain acces to 
the Pilot bearing? If the bearing is in decent shape can I grease it up 
without removing the flywheel? The reason I ask is I am going to be taking 
apart my clutch tonight and am not quite sure I feel like messing around 
with the flywheel. All opinions welcome.

cheers....
