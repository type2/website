DOH!, Cold busted.

&gt;Oh my gawd! I can't believe I have to get up in the morning and and find
&gt;this ego maniacle crap on my computer!
&gt;
&gt;We all know Nikki isn't driving across the country just for Everybus.
&gt;She's doing it so she can have a sip of the delicious nectar, otherwise
&gt;known as everybeer, brewed by yours truely, ME.
&gt;
&gt;Chris, I hate to bust your bubble like that. But facts are facts.
&gt;
&gt;I think you should consider changing the name of the event to Everybeer
&gt;and bus.
&gt;
&gt;Ego Maniacly yours,
&gt;John

When you say Yustweiser - you've said it all :)
