Subject: re: where would you go?

For a very long time I've wanted to make the trek from the northeastern
U.S. to Chile.  Yes, Chile - as in &quot;really far from where I am&quot;.  I chose
Chile largely because I have an offer of a place to crash from someone I
went to high school with (someone who probably doesn't even remember who I
am at this point) and it seemed like an interesting place to go.
I'm figuring I'd need to take a 3-month leave of absence, and I'd need to
have some money saved up, but what an amazing trip it would be even if I
didn't make it all the way.  Besides, it would be great to see someplace
entirely different from NH and western NY, the two places I've lived my
whole life.  I figure a 3-4 month leave of absence should give me time to
see a bunch of cool things along the way.  I don't even know what kind of
reception I'd get as a long-haired freak in a beat up old bus crossing all
of those borders, but it'd be a great experience and I'm going to keep it
in the back of my mind.  Maybe after all of these pesky student loans are
paid off...
