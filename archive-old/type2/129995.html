Steve,

I tried to contact you off-list but it appears you are having trouble with 
mail.  Do you still need help with your apache config?  If so, what verion 
of apache are you running, and can you send me a copy of your httpd.conf file?

Volks,

freebsd/apache... As I posted earlier in the week, I had a catastrophic HD
crash on the everybus machine.  I still have the files for the web sites,
but lost all the configuration files.  I have been working as I can to get
sendmail and apache working again.  As of tonight, I have sendmail working
(I think) (w/o spam filtering, I KNOW :-( and I have apache working in
single-site mode.  I CANNOT get &quot;virtual domains&quot; working, however, which
means that www.busesofthecorn_dot_com is still not working (it takes you to
everybus_dot_com).  If anyone out there knows diddly about virtual domains
under apache and/or freebsd, please, Please, PLEASE get in touch!!!!  I am
desperate and willing to pay as much as a full 6-pack!!!! (Greg may be
willing to double that :-)
