Help, started my bus yesterday morning (15 degrees out) and started driving
down the road as a noxious smell started coming out the heater.  Looked out
the rear view mirror and saw smoke bellowing out the back.  Stopped, grabbed
the extinguisher and opened the engine door to find thankfully no fire, but
oil all over the rear of the engine, on the cooling assembly, belts, generator
etc.  Also oil was dripping down below onto the ground.  No other signs of oil
leaks anywhere.  So far I can't find out where its coming from (the plastic
piece holding the dipstick is cracked but I don't think this is new) Anybody
experience this before or anyone have any ideas?

Thanks for the help.
