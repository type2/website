&gt;&gt;seal is missing around the brake and/or clutch pedal.

&gt;I didn't even know there were supposed to be seals here.

Emily,

The seals are the same part number as the spark plug seals (OE). I get mine off
old plug wires. You might check a dealer as they often have oddball engine tin
rubber parts. The pedals have to be removed at the bolt under the floor in order
to install the seals, and they travel up and down with the pedal, so your cat
can still enjoy him/herself.
BTW, I just installed that heat shrink window film on my jalousy windows
(removed the screens and put it on the screen frames). Helps eliminate some of
the draftiness.
