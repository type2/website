Subject: Re: [T2] Engine installation woes...

Heresy! Such sins! The Gods will strike you dead! You bus will rust and 
your tires will go flat!!!

&lt;grin!&gt;

Interesting - - I've always been to scared to try that experiment - not to 
mention it is alot of work to take them out and put them back in for the 
sake of experience.

Great post!

&gt;Part 2 is experience.  I have driven my bus both with and without the 
&gt;cooling flaps with a full compliment of gauges and everything else for 
&gt;practical purposes identical.  The result was that I did not notice an 
&gt;increase in oil temperature without the flaps.  In fact, I saw a slight 
&gt;decrease in oil temps.  I know this is going to upset a lot of people but 
&gt;based on my experience I do not think that running without cooling flaps 
&gt;is going to destroy a type IV motor in short order.  Of course I have no 
&gt;long-term test results so I can't claim that it doesn't cause long-term 
&gt;damage but based on my gauge readings I suspect that long-term damage 
&gt;would be minimal as well, in my situation.  My situation means (at that 
&gt;time) Southern California where the temp never drops below 45 degrees F.
&gt;
&gt;I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about this - I am NOT 
&gt;advocating running without the cooling flaps!  I am also NOT claiming that 
&gt;running without cooling flaps is okay vs. running with cooling flaps and a 
&gt;thermostat.  I am simply comparing these two scenarios:
&gt;
&gt;a) Running with no flaps
&gt;b) Running with flaps and no thermostat or thermostat unhooked (flaps 
&gt;always open)
&gt;
&gt;And saying that IMNSHO one is not that much worse than the other.
&gt;
&gt;As I said before though, your best bet is to get the flaps now and install 
&gt;them, and hook up your thermostat.  If you don't want to upset your 
&gt;mechanic (which may lead to other problems, right?) let him have his way 
&gt;and do your best to get the flaps and install them in a reasonable 
&gt;timeframe, but don't worry that your engine will destroy itself in a 
&gt;matter of days or weeks, because it won't.
