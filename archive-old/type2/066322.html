Jean Baptiste Le Pesant asks &quot;What are &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers&quot;?

Well, Jean, here in the US we use these stickers called &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers as a
scale indicator to how much a VW bus is trashed. The more of these &quot;Deadhead&quot;
stickers on a bus, the worse the condition of the bus, and the nearer the bus is
to it's death, hence the name &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker.  On buses that have their
windows totally covered with &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers, those are usually are not far
from being junked. 

Ok, folks , let me slip into my firesuit first.....

OK COMMENCE!!!!
