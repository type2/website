*Distributer&quot; search.
**************************************
That is correct, there is no 3rd Cyl retard.  However, all 050's I've seen
and used are Mechanical Advance.  CB did offer at one time (I don't know if
they do now) a distributor with both vacuum and mechanical advance - sort
of a 050 with vacuum can attached, but I've never seen one outside of CB's
catalog.

*The best performance with the old 009 was setting the timing at 10 btdc,

*the engine would start to stall.
*
*Could somebody with some 050 experience let me know where to set this
*timing, and what are the limits on  the advance at say 3500 rpm?  I don't
*want to burn the engine up.
*********************************
The 050 can present a problem in that the total advance can be as much as
10 degrees higher at total advance at 3000-3500rpm, causing detontation
(pinging) and overheat the engine under sustained operation.  050's a great
for &quot;ricky racing&quot; on the street or drag strip, which is what CB has the
distributor designed for in the first place.  It's essentially a &quot;poor
man's&quot; Porsche 912 (0231 129 031) distributor.

My advice is to install a Late 76-78 distributor with a single
vacuum/mechanical advance combination.  Originally, this distributor is
designed with fuel injection specs in mind, but personal experience
installing this distributor on dual carbed engines have yielded very
satisfactory results - the advance curves between the original Dual
Diaphragm (Push-Pull) Distributor and the FI Distributor are close enough
to be very useable.  It's nice to have that vacuum assisted advance in stop
and go traffic and the mechanical advance for highway use.  Recommended
timing is 7.5 degrees BTDC with the Vacuum Hose Connected.

Why did VW use so many distributors between 72-78 (and Federal 79-83) when
their advance characteristics were only a degree or two apart?  Passing the
EPA and CARB specs at the time each vehicle year was introduced is the
primary reason.  Nowadays, you'll find VW and Bosch superseding a multitude
of original distributor numbers to just a few for replacement.  
*
*set up: 1800 type IV (the kind with the plastic timing scale), Dual
*Dellorto 36 DRLAs.
*(would gladly install a stock vacume distributer if available at a decent
*price) 
*************************************
A stock distributor (points style) with the vacuum can is very reasonably
priced at $79.95 PLUS $35.00 Core Charge.  New ones are very pricey.
