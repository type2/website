Jim,

I'm not a performance car buff so I'm probably missing something, but I 
thought one of the primary performance reasons for installing alloy wheels 
was to reduce the weight that is spinning on the ends of the axles.  Wouldn't 
the weight of wheel adapters negate the benefits of the lighter alloy wheels.?
