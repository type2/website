'75 westy (135hp :) -- still in Montreal :(
'79 'vert -- still in the Bay Area :(
'95 Passat GLX VR6 -- in Alabama, but for sale

PS: I'm taking my convertible bug from California to Alabama, leaving SF on
the 25th and (hopefully) arriving in Tuscaloosa on the 29th. Anyone care to
join me and help with the driving? :) I'm not yet sure whether I'll take
I-40 or I-10/I-20, but I always welcome the opportunity of meeting other
listmembers, so if you're along one of those route, give me a holler! ;)
