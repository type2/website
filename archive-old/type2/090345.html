Subject: Re: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

&gt; Burst a water bed inside a bus and two things would probably happen...
&gt; The engine would probably flood and die causing very rapid deceleration
&gt; coupled with a decided list in the direction the water decided to take...
&gt; Altogether, as Laurie Anderson once said, &quot;I'd rather see this on TV...&quot;

No. I think youd have about 2 feet of water in the cargo area or in a
walkthrough about 18 inches in the cargo and cab area. And it would be
leaking out as fast as it could find a path.
