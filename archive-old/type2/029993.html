&gt; I've just become the proud owner of a '69 Bus. My wife has always wanted a
&gt; red '69 VW Bus, and a friend found one in the barn of the place he just
&gt; moved into. And he let us have it for $25.00. This particular Bus had been
&gt; sitting in a barn for at least 6 years (or I should say that the plates
&gt; expired 6 years ago) and looks it. We got it running, put on new tires,
&gt; completely rebuilt the braking system ( between the brakes and the rust it's
&gt; probably why it was parked) and it moves under it's own will and skill now.
&gt; 
&gt; But I have some questions;
&gt; 1. The shifter has interesting movements and its a gamble as to which gear
&gt; it goes into. which parts of the shifter should I be looking at first?

The bushings that support the shift linkage and the shift coupler.  IF
it's staying in gear once in the transmission is probably OK.

&gt; 2. The engine seal is so-so how critical is it?

Very.  It keeps the hot  air the engine has just spewed out from being
recirculated back into the cooling fan.  Pull the engine and replace all
the seals (you have to pull the engine to get at the front seal, which is
why this seal is probably worse than the ones you can see.)

&gt; 3  It also has serious rust issues where both front seats mount what's the
&gt; best way to repair the seat mounts.

The fix is dependent upon the extent of the damage.  Basically you remove
metal to get rid of the rust, then fab and weld in new metal.
