Subject: Many thanks for your advices!

I DO appreciate, a lot! (many P-mail)

One thing, many of you nice folks warn me about the wheel bearing!
Last thing i would think that would fail on a VW.

I did more than 50k miles on my 2 Vanagons without ever having  to worry
about those old and loose wheel bearing, are they that different on the
Bay/bus???
I have no noise or loose what so ever, but if you think i should buy a
spare set for the front and rear i will do so!

For those who worry about my drive axles, i just did those last weekend
(new boot and grease), i have a pare velocity joint and boot, i can
change one joint on the road in about 20-30 minute.

Again,  i want to thank you guys, i also appeciate all the oofer i got
for hosting my Canadian ass for a night.

Live long and prosper (Or poor!!! in a VW)
Ben
