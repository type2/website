My '79 Cali is running great, but is getting terrible (8-sh) mpg. I know there are a litany of things that
might be the cause of this, but I'm wondering where to even start diagnosing. What is the most likely culprit?

The bus has been firing up fine, even in very cold weather, and idles as it should. Occasionally it will
&quot;miss&quot; on cold start for a few minutes; meaning that if it's revved after cold start it sounds like it's down
a cylinder. After warmup, however, the bus runs great and is smooth through the RPM range.

However, the exhaust is quite fumy and it's pretty evident that the mixture is off. Some black smoke is
present when the motor is revved, but nothing severe. The inside of the tailpipe is black and sooty, and the
plugs show even amounts of soot. Obviously, something ain't right.

So, should I dive right into jacking with the AFM? Could the O2 sensor or a leaky coldstart valve cause this
much grief? I'm afraid to start poking around too much, just because it's my daily driver it's running so well
otherwise. Any practical advice is much appreciated.

NO NO NO do NOT touch the AFM.

Test test test first.

Dirty air filter?

Loose Temp Sensor II by #3 intake runner?

Cold start valve leaking?

Fuel pressure regulator leaking?

No vacuum to the fuel pressure regulator and it is in full rich mode?

Fuel pressure too high?

Test test test FIRST.

These are a few things off the top of my head.

Forget about the O2 sensor for now, basic FI should give you 16-18 mpg.

Forget about ignition problems for now, a weak coil will not make it dump excess fuel.
