Subject: Re: [T2] mini spare tire from an Audi

&gt; I saw in the archive that someone asked about using a mini spare tire from an
&gt; Audi.  I picked one up from the junkyard last week.

&gt; I did it because I always use quality tires
&gt; and I've never had a flat.  No sense lugging around all that weight if I
&gt; don't have to.

Interesting difference in philosophies here.  I run quality tires too
(Bridgestone 603s) and I always carry _two_ full size spares while on road
trips.  The reason is that I have had two flats on the same day and ended
up having to buy an &quot;odd&quot; tire when I couldn't find a match for the tires
I had.  Of course, I go off the beaten urban path and sometimes a long
way from pavement where a second spare is pretty much standard equipment
for everyone.
