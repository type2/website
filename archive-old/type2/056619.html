Subject: Re: hot start quick fix

Dear list,

The following exchange recently occurred on the list, in relation to a
&quot;warm start&quot; problem in Rodney Boleyn's 78 stock FI bus:

&gt;&gt;Rodney- still puttin'?  My 78 has 194K on it now!  The hot no-start problem
&gt;&gt;was getting worse (first time kickin' it with a jumper under car wouldn't
&gt;&gt;let me start it when climbin' back in the seat)
&gt;
Then Rodney Boleyn &lt;rboleyn_at_sqi_dot_com&gt; replied:
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, I'm using it as my daily driver.  But since you ask, mine is not
&gt;really a hot start problem.  It's a *warm start* problem.  [This is a
&gt;stock 78 FI'd Type IV.]
&gt;
&gt;If engine is cold, it kicks right over.
&gt;
&gt;If engine is at normal operating temp (N.O.T.), it kicks right over.
&gt;
&gt;If engine was at N.O.T., but has been cooling an hour or so, crank,
&gt;crank, crank, no fire.  Really makes going shopping interesting.  If
&gt;I let it sit for four hours after N.O.T., it kicks right over.
&gt;
&gt;It's that one-hour cool-down, where the engine is at some intermediate
&gt;temperature, that seems to be the problem.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone got any ideas?  I'm thinking Temp Sensor II is showing age,
&gt;maybe its resistance curve is off--min and max values are OK, but
&gt;intermediate values occur at wrong time during warm up.  Is that a
&gt;known problem with those NTC sensors as they get older?  Anything
&gt;else it could be?

We had the same kind of problem with Guac (stock 78 FI) on our trip west
last month. It spun fine when the engine was at operating temp, and when
cold, but sometimes not in between. I had to do the
crawl-under-the-bus-with-big-screwdriver thing about 5 times. The most
embarrassing moment came in Tensleep, WY, during which I not only had to
crawl under the bus several times while taking up one of the four gas bays
at the local gas station, but also quickly rereading the section in Muir
about solenoid jumping. The bus only started when I jumped the ignition
terminal on the solenoid to the main connection on it.

Finally, on the way back, in a nice, grassy campsite in the Crazy Woman
Campground in Gillette, WY, I hammered the solenoid as per Muir (as others
have mentioned, it's not easy; not a lot of swinging room under there) and
cleaned up all the solenoid connections. Since that time, we've had the
problem only once, the next day in fact. I plan to pull the starter soon,
try to clean up the solenoid and lubricate it, replace the solenoid if
necessary, as a more permanent fix. In the meantime, I'm carrying the
jumper wire and my faithful piece of cardboard stowed in a handy position!

In our case, if it were the Temp Sensor going bad, I don't know why the
problem would have stopped after treating the solenoid with the hammer
therapy.

Good luck!
