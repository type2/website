Subject: Re: [T2] correction Re: WI TechPix2

Busahaulic stated:
&gt;It's the simplicity of Roberts design that makes it
&gt;all work.

	Bussy you're too kind.


&gt;  (Theoretically)

	yes, that too  -  but much more importantly, in thousands of 
miles of testing on many different carbs.
	FI &amp; diesel much less researched, but nonetheless far better 
proven than any other widely-useable way of improving power &amp;/or 
mileage c.10%.


&gt;  the silicone will be
&gt;mushroomed at the outer end of the hole and that will
&gt;prevent any movement.

	The right silicone will allow several placements &amp; removals 
while retaining perfect seal.

&gt;
&gt;Remember that the reservoir must be at a point where
&gt;it is below the needle in every possible driving
&gt;situation. Because of that, the water is only drawn
&gt;out the needle when there is a low pressure area at
&gt;the tip of the needle.  When the throttle is closed,
&gt;there is nothing to draw water up through the needle.

	Rahd awn Bussy
	But this latter 'autoshutoff' may not be essential.  What 
little air is drawn past the needle on the over-run may well benefit 
from humidifying &amp; cooling.  A large flow on the over-run might 
conceivably chill the cyl heads fast enough to crack them, but I 
doubt it; listen for whistling sounds   ...

&gt;
&gt;Robert has not done it on a FI motor and I have not
&gt;done it on a FI motor. I had all kinds of elaborate
&gt;schemes of using injectors and presuure, but none
&gt;would work as well as his concept.

	Welcome news indeed  -  even the cyberdazzled can recover 
from digital complexity and get back to basics, analogue processes, 
and appropriate technology.  Yet he can retain ability for 
cyberimaging eclipsing my own.


&gt;  One of my ideas was
&gt;to remove the EGR piping inside the plenum and add
&gt;another coldstart injector at the EGR port. That would
&gt;inject the water right toward the incoming flow of
&gt;air. The problems in making that work properly are
&gt;quite a few and some pretty major. With Robert's
&gt;design, mother nature does all the work.

	Flattery will get you somewheres, Bussi.  Failure modes 
proliferate with comlexity, more than you can imagine.  Simplicity is 
the watchword; use forces already to hand, and minimize transducers, 
power inputs, etc.  Find a force that varies according to need and 
tap into that.

&gt;
&gt;Pay attention to the size of needle he recommends. He
&gt;seems to be directing us to use a larger needle for FI
&gt;but I think that is incorrect. The engines are
&gt;basically the same size and so the needles should be
&gt;the same size.

	woop woop woop    pull up   pull up
	See the point by recalling the venturi in the   -  grope back 
now, stay with me  -  carb. The same flow (cc/s) where sucked thru a 
narrow stretch flows faster (cm/s) , sucking fuel out of a Solex 
power jet suspended in the middle, or water out of a tiny hole in the 
wall retarding the distributor timing as vac drops upon opening of 
the throttle 'ahead of the rpm' when preignition becomes more likely 
but is totally quashed, quelled &amp; kybosched by WI.


&gt;The FI engine is not any more efficient
&gt;than the carb version.

	Sock it to 'em Bussy  -  in theory they're right but so many 
faults can degrade performance in even early FI that it may not 
achieve any better economy than a well maintained carb.
	Anyhow both stand to benefit from WI so we can leave aside 
this argument.  We're trying to help the FI airhowlers.


&gt;  The only reason the needle may
&gt;need more volume is if the airflow through the TB is
&gt;too slow, which I think shall not be a problem if the
&gt;needle is placed where I indicated with the end
&gt;approximately midway between the wide open butterfly
&gt;and the sidewall of the throttle body bore.

	This is not a venturi with anything like the suction of the 
far smaller cross-section in a carb venturi putting thru a similar 
flow.  Therefore a blood donor needle, or two, is needed.
	The much smaller needles made for Vacutainers are needed for 
the smaller air horn just inside the carb in the 1600 DP.  The 
suction there is so large that 0.5 mm ID gives a rather high water 
feed rate.  That makes the filter more crucial.  With the big needles 
blockage by dirt is less likely.  Make the most of the acquisition of 
that panty=hose hem, because one will make 10^2 filters.  A nut 
screwing onto the 5mm OD PVC tube holds the filter and weighs down 
that pickup near the bottom of the bottle.

&gt;
&gt;Note also that the placement of the needle is very
&gt;slightly upstream of the closed butterfly.

	Right on
&gt;
&gt;There IS a possibility that because of the increased
&gt;velocity of the air moving around the butterfly in
&gt;partially opened throttle positions, having the needle
&gt;there might actually cause a greater flow of water in
&gt;those situations than in wide-open throttle
&gt;situations. I don't know the answer to that and
&gt;neither does Robert, so it would be up to whoever
&gt;wants to try it to determine if this theoretical best
&gt;position is actually going to work as planned!

	Exactly
	The vac regime so ably envisaged by Busahaulic would maximise 
the economy &amp; cooling at cruise, while retaining enough vac on 
wide-throttle acceleration to quell preignition.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, remember this: water is not compressible!  That
&gt;means that if you have too much water, something has
&gt;to give - like a valve head or a piston crown or a
&gt;connecting rod... and so it is imperative that the
&gt;water flow only when there is airflow past the needle.
&gt;No pressure in the bottle, no pump, no gravity flow.

	Will that be recorded by bob Seeger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If I had taken this step years ago and used it on my
&gt;T4 motor that had 10.92:1 compression ratio, I'd
&gt;probably still be running that motor instead of
&gt;woosing out and installing the Subey!

	The most I'm dreaming of is my 50 hp motor giving 70 hp for 
brief hillclimbing, and passing Splitties.  I fear the water will at 
best get me only half the way; other notions being developed under 
shrouds  ...


&gt;(I do plan on
&gt;adding water injection to the subey soon.)

	steady on ole fella  -  can you handle that much torque?

&gt;
&gt;I hope this sheds some light on the subject for you
&gt;and that you realize there are unanswered questions
&gt;that you will have to figure out on your own and that
&gt;there is some risk inherent in the project, especially
&gt;if you stray from Robert's design.

	This would be correct.
	Sock it to 'em
	Tell eet lahk EET  EEEEUZ

	No WI is not too good to be true.  It's the only proven way 
to get substantial improvement in cooling, emissions, power, &amp; 
economy.  Nobody, not even Busahaulic, can patent it, and groups of 
VW enthusiasts could make small production runs bringing very little 
profit.  D Trump would not attempt takeover.  The people can help 
themselves, using some rubbish from the consumer frenzy (the plastic 
water bottles).
	Mark Dearing will be redeveloping his sparger fogger to 
humidify the sucked-in air more thoroughly.  That looks like the next 
great leap forward  -  key component sintered glass fish-bubbler.  It 
too will be unpatentable &amp; DIY.  J C Whitney may resume selling a WI 
kit.  Holley may wake up from their stupid 12V pump pushing air in 
the top of the air-cleaner, with transducers on water temp &amp; vac. 
Don't give them a cent.  Do as Busahaulic &amp; Unca Robt say  -  or else 
you will continue to waste c.10% of the fuel you buy, emit more toxic 
exhaust fumes, run hotter than necessary, and lay less rubber as you 
burn off Grand Ams at the lights.
