Sure.

There is a 4wd rally bug (used to be a superbeetle) that does just this.


If you pull the nosecone off of a bug or bus transaxle, you will see a big
ol' bearing right there in the front.

Tear the transaxle down, fabricate a new part that goes through this
bearing that extends forward...of course, you'll need to add some
bearings, etc.

Bring it out to a CV flange or what have you, forward to a backwards &quot;rear
end&quot; that uses CV axles.  He used a saab rearend.  Custom gearing all
around.


In a bus, you'd need to either lower the entire suspension assembly in
relation to the body...or change suspension setups.

You dont have much room to work at the front of the transmission to come
out and down...you could lower the transaxle to give you room to come out
straight.

Anyway...that should give you some ideas.

Someone may have the link to the pictures and descriptions of the bug...
