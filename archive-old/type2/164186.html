Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS - Clutch went out near SF! UPDATE

Ok,
Clutch installed, engine installed, just finishing 
tightening up all the screws.  Picked up a new clutch and 
pressure plate from kohlweiss at 8am this morning. 
 Everything seems to be going good so far.  Should have 
the van fired up in about an hour after I get all the efi 
stuff hooked up again.

thanks!
Mike
