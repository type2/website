Subject: 13 Busses in Ecology Junk Yard (long)

Earlier in the week, I mentioned that there happened to be a few busses
in the ecology junk yard in wilmington ca.  I was surprised at the
volume of off list inquiries that resulted.  Rather than try and
recollect all the details about the vehicles, and give out erroneous
information, I dropped by there this morning (80 degree weather &amp;
sunshine is great on the 1st day of winter).  I have provided a list of
the vehicles which includes vanagons, type IIs and one burnt out
splitty.  The vanagon westy was the best condition of all and I suspect
that the engine and trans will work just fine if transplanted into
another vehicle.  It had a fire in the area above the trans that looks
to be where a gas heater might have been.

The busses are at
Ecology Auto Wrecking
Corner of Lomita &amp; Wilmington Blvds, 2 miles south of the 405 fwy
Wilmington CA
310-835-5865

I have included the row that the vehicle is in and the date it arrived
in the yard.  They said that they usually clear a row out after it has
been there 3 weeks.  I have found that the trucks typically stay a bit
longer.  The rows are numbered from north to south, north being row 1
and the farthest south row is 10.

If there is something that you just have to have and figure that with
the cost of the part, shipping and throwing a bone my way to take it out
and pack it up for you, pmail me OFF the list and we'll see what we can
work out.

One of you guys were looking for rear shock supports for a splitty.
They were in the kombi, but a much easier way would be to contact Bus
Boys and ask to buy a set of shock mounts that they sell with their IRS
kit.

Happy Holidays,
Scott Fraser
