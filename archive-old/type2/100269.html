Subject: stored engine revival/assessment ?'s

Hello list,

My buddy has found a potential 2 liter engine within driving distance. 
However, we have a few questions. The engine was running when removed from a 
bus after an accident 4 or 5 years ago and has been stored since.

1) would a compression test be useful or accurate with an engine that has 
sat so long? And can one be done with the engine out? And how? wouldn't you 
need the starter? Forgive me if this is a dumb question.

2)How would the engine seals be given the storage time?  I'm sure this 
depends on how old and worn they were before the engine was removed. Would 
inactivity lead to cracking/leaking of the seals?

3)what about a leak down test? Would this be accurate?

4)what else are we missing? Is there something that should be refurbished?

Mainly he justs wants a used engine that he could throw in and have in be 
worth the effort. We are just trying to minimize risks of buying a used 
engine and attempting to answer the seemingly unanswerable? Hence the post.

As always hope this makes sense.
