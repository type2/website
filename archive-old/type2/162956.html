&gt;Mark,
&gt;       Wouldn't it be great if we could buy
&gt;off-the-shelf a lightweight electric motor that bolts right up to the VW's
&gt;bellhousing?

	A sensible vision.  Mind you, purpose-designed electric 
vehicles don't use a gearbox or clutch (saving considerable weight, 
and some running noise); all we need is the diff.


&gt;A little more weight in the central section, perhaps from
&gt;batteries and/or fuel cells, would be OK as long as the motor weighed less.

	right on

&gt;
&gt;One could read this kind of idea in the Pop Mech magazines years ago; but AYMK
&gt;with then-existing technology the performance was poor

	I think this is an unfortunate term.  It has been easy for a 
half-century to convert a car, e.g a Beetle, to burn rubber at 70mph 
or more  -  to outperform most petrol cars in speed &amp; acceleration. 
The key problem has been RANGE  i.e battery storage.


&gt;  and the price high.

	But need it be, in any reasonable scale of production?


&gt;I dream that the technology will advance (and the related prices will decline)
&gt;while there remain enough VW Type 2s to make the business case compute.

	right on

...

&gt;
&gt;I'll be delighted if I can keep the old Microbus as my Sunday driver for my
&gt;remaining on-planet time.  For my daily driver any econobox will have to do.

	If one's daily drive is only, say, 40 mi  -  a common 
pattern, for millions of drivers  -  existing electric vehicle 
technology is fine.
