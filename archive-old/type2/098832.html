Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

 It'll help keep it lubricated 
&gt; better. It may smoke a little.&quot; This guy is really good with VW's, but this 
&gt; advice kindof rubbed me the wrong way. I never tried it. What do you 
&gt; all think?

this summer a very experienced vw friend was putting marvel oil in at the gas station with his gas
and i inquired and he told a similar story and has been putting a 1/4 of marvel oil in with every
full tank of gas for years. has seen no ill effects and thinks it is a good thing.  
so far i have just tried the marvel before an oil change.  so i don't have personal exp.
