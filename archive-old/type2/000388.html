Hammerite is alright but not a permanent solution as we would like to think.
My 'White' hammerite wheels discolour to yellowish 'white' in time.
Lumps get knocked off changing tyres etc.
I use wire wool to brighten them up but they need repainting again.
Believe me, brush with care as this stuff  DOES RUN.
After brush painting my roofrack bars, I sanded them down due to runs etc
then sprayed with an ordinary blue aerosol spray can - best of both worlds -
super finish, protection underneath.
I also paint inside my hubcaps for protection.
