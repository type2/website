Subject: RE: V-8 091 R&amp;P

Mike and all the others that replied,

Thanks for your info on the 091 ring and pinion.  Sounds like I'll be geting
in touch with Weddle and geting something shipped down to Australia (Where I
am) or maybe a local guy If I can find one.

The V8 is actually in the Bus and has been up and running for a few years in
it's current guise.  I wanted the lower ratio R&amp;P because I'm going to try
and stuff 33&quot; tires under the rear and 29&quot; under the front, after a serious
lift of course.  I'm going for the Monster Bus look.  Currently I have 29&quot;
under the back but hey... it's just not quite Wild enough.

Anyway, again, thanks for the help
Cheers
Steve

P.S As for instructions, the closest you'll get is my sites at...

Subject: V-8 091 R&amp;P

Greetings -

I have my Weddle Engineering catalog, and it looks like Page 9 has a 5.43
R&amp;P for $225. There's also a 5.86 for $275 (used) or $492.96 (new).

They're at (562)598-2731.

Good luck. We'll see step by step instructions on putting that V-8 in the
bus?

Mike Visket
