Subject: Camper ID (to UK members really)

This is driving me crazy - the kind of camper with the small flat pop top that
lies almost flush with the roof and goes straight up and has 2 hammocks in -
what kind is it?  I thought it was a Devon but - ???  Can someone enlighten me
please?  (I think this only applies to loafs / bays / whatever you want to
call them.)
