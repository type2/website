Being as this was posted to the type2 list.....I am assuming it is a 68 and
up and since you live in Calif. and you mentioned smog checks, it must be 74
and up. But a little more info as to engine size and bus year would help!

 &gt; Now for the questions:
 &gt; Can I rebuild the dist. or should I replace it?
 &gt; Should I buy a 009 or stock (vacuum advance) I live in Cal. still have
 &gt; to pass smog!
 &gt; If I do need to buy one dose any one know where to get one on the cheap
 &gt; (money is a problem)
 &gt;
 &gt; P.S.
 &gt; All parts are new.(coil, points, etc.)
