Subject: Re: [T2] RE: towing

&gt;The previous owner of our '70 Campmobile towed a regular travel trailer [NOT
&gt;a tent trailer] to Alaska and back.  That definitely put a big strain on the
&gt;drive train and I had some repairs to make after a few thousand miles of
&gt;driving the camper.

Dad and mom regularly towed our 6 person Wheelcamper popup with
the '76 from about '78-'85 with no great trouble.  On flat interstates you
could easily zip along at 75mph though it all got a little &quot;light.&quot;  But
the original engine in the '76 only went 85k miles, even with extremely
good maintainence.  Did the towing have anything to do with it, I don't
know really.  This was with 5 and sometimes 6 people in the bus and
quite a load of food/clothes/whatever in both the bus and camper.

Anyway we towed it out of WV all over the east coast from FL to Toronto
a lot of the time before the current interstate system was in place.  It sure
crawled up the hills getting out of WV though.  Fully loaded this thing was
about 500 pound (2 adults to lift) tongue weight, I have no idea how much
it weighed but it was a lot heavier built than anything today.
