Subject: Car Insurance for US Vacationers in the UK?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Evon, Haley, and I are planning an October trip to Europe, just as soon as
the new website is up.  It may be our last chance for easy travel for a
while, since at 3 months old, Haley is still quite portable - and besides, I
really need a vacation!  (Besides, it will also be a parts-scouting
expedition, so I can mix business with lots of pleasure.)

Anyway, a customer of mine who runs a VW shop outside of London has
graciously offered to make a Vanagon camper available to us for a
yet-to-be-worked-out reasonable cost.  This is a must, because if we are to
afford the trip, we'll have to mainly live in our bus.

Problem is, it's looking like we can't buy auto insurance in the U.S. that's
valid in Europe, and we certainly couldn't ask my customer to add us to his
policy.  Has anyone had any experience getting car insurance in the UK
(other than with cars rented from rental companies)?  Must we actually buy
the van in order to buy insurance for it?  Any advice?

Thanks,
