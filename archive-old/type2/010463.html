All,

This is an interesting point....I bought my first bus
in '81. It was a '57 23 window sans canvas, moderate
rust holes in the rockers, EVERY single original piece
(including aluminum trim, *straight* bumpers,
hand-crank, gas-lid key, jail-bars, 6v, etc.). I paid
$150.00 for it....that *same* bus would easily fetch
$5,000.00+ now.


Read on....

&gt; I saw Thom has put the '55 Westy up for sale, asking
&gt; $20k.  At first I said 
&gt; to myself &quot;no way&quot;, then I read he's got at least
&gt; $10k in receipts alone for 
&gt; parts.

Yep. Parts are expensive...especially when you care
enough to buy parts that are as close to O.E.M. as
possible. I have several hundred dollars in rubber
seals alone, just waiting to be installed in my '69
Westy. Add to that $200.00 in VDO guages/sending
units, $300.00 for new tires, $175.00 for new canvas
for the poptop, $60.00 for poptop seals, $30.00 for
poptop hold downs, $75.00 for a battery, $45.00 for
cabinet handles, $150.00 for a replacement
rear-bumper.... I've got *tons* more, but the list is
endless. *LOTS* of money. And this is *far* from a
resto!

 
&gt; I thought I did &quot;good&quot; when I sold a '77 Westy for
&gt; $4k.

Maybe you did, but most '77s don't need all of the
above to be replaced....yet. The *real* cost will come
when all those parts mentioned above start wearing
out.
 
&gt; Are you guys seeing Westys being bought for $10k and
&gt; above??  That just gets 
&gt; away from my notion of a VW Bus being cheap
&gt; transportation....for example my 
&gt; rusty yet reliable '70 for $400.

Busses are NOT CHEAP transportation!!!! Yes, you can
buy a beater and only do &quot;survival&quot; maintenance, but
if compared to say, a mid-80's Honda or Toyota, you
will still spend more on a bus over the next 10
years...and that includes doing your own maintenance
on the bus!!!

I once bought an '83 Nissan truck for $2,100.00. I
owned and *seriously* abused it for 4 years. I spent a
total of $650.00 on maintenance (not including
oil-changes/tune-ups &lt;if and when I ever got around to
doing them&gt;). It also got 32 mpg. I seriously doubt
many bus-owners could make that claim. 
 
&gt; Just curious as to price comparisons around the
&gt; country for nice buses.  

For campers, that definitely changes by region.
They're fairly cheap and plentiful in the Northwest,
but can be scarce and spendy elsewhere. I bought my
'69 Westy in Portland, Or.(spring, '98), for
$2,300.00. It is (or was, anyway) completely original,
down to the original spare-tire (yeah, I know...I need
to change it, but it's soooo cool!) and owners-manual.
I actually spent about $400.00 more for it than I
thought it was worth, but I wanted *this* bus, and it
was worth it. It has only surface-rust where there are
scratches/dings, and has the original paint. It was
also dealer-maintained through '79 in Southern
California.

If I was to sell my bus today (cold day in Hell!!!), I
wouldn't take a penny less than $4,500.00 for it and
all the parts I have for it, including the Westy tent.

Just my .02$
