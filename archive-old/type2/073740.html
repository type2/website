Subject: Fw: Octoberbus/Below the Salt T Shitrs

Several people at Oktoberbus approached me asking  if I had any extra
t-shirts.  The answer was no, BUT if enough folks pony up I can have my
printer do another run before he recycles the screens.  Let me know if
you're interested by p-mail and follow up by following the instructions on
the order form.

 Where are the orderforms?  That's easy!  This link will transport you to
the
 very web page with complete directions on how to accomplish this not very
 difficult task.
