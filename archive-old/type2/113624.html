Subject: Re: [T2] Suspension Clunk

&gt;Could it be my motor mounts?  How would I tell?  It is very loud and 
&gt;distracting, and the handling is still not tip top (whatever tip top for a 
&gt;bus means).

Dead suspension bushings. Dead swaybar bushings. Basically the shocks are 
moving some of the bounce control back to the suspension. Bushings are 
sloppy and you hear it.

My motor mounts were all torn as well. The ones above the bellhousing 
allowed the tranny to shift (slide) over and allow the metal tranny mount 
to rest against the metal frame and made my bus quiet loud.
