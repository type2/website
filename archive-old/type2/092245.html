Subject: Terryville CT show


Anyone going the VW show in Terryville CT this weekend...?

I'm heading down there with a single wheel trailer (FS) and some
interesting literature

My buddy will be there with lots of new reproduction stickers and
decals  (mostly for Busses).

He makes the &quot;open/ close&quot; sticker for the exterior sliding door handle,
a couple of the interior warning labels for early Bay westies, the
washer bottle label for the bus kickpanel, and the early Bay exterior
shore power hookup.  He is currently working on the late Bay shore power
label and the 3 utility door labels for Vanagon Westies.

He also has both the large (vanagon) Westfalia label and the small
(baywindow) westfalia label as well as the Westfalia &quot;prancing horse&quot;
for the sides of the luggage rack....

He also has a good selection of static cling Dead stickers and other VW
related stickers

Look for the Coca-cola SuperBeetle for the stickers

And the big white Chevy C2500 for the unique single wheel &quot;Allstate&quot;
trailer and literature...
