Subject: Re: [T2] Part inquiry and advice

Hi Richard,

The material you spotted is indeed asbestos; do not inhale any dust when
removing these collars. Try not to touch it with bare skin; use disposable
rubber gloves instead. Asbestos is known to cause cancer.

The asbestos parts can be replaced with late beetle (76-79) collars, VW p/n
111 819 945, or you can replace the entire flex pipe assembly. The late
beetle units are made of rubber; last week I got 4 of them from a VWFLAPS
used for $CDN10.00 . New units are available from a VW dealer for $CDN15.

US$1.00 = $CDN1.60
$CDN1.00 = $US0.625

On the other point: I'm not a metallurgist; but I'd bet you just need to
de-gunk the case before the aluminum polish can get to work.

Happy trails,

&gt; In this picture, does anyone know what the white cuffs at the end of the
&gt; heat exchanger control boxes are called?  They looks like asbestos or
&gt; something.  I'd like to replace them.

&gt; 
&gt; In this one, I'm trying to clean the front of the case.  Is this magnesium
&gt; because it's not responding to Aluminum polish?  What will clean this up?
