Subject: RE: [T2] Belly Pan?

Belly Pan?

This is interesting.  I've got two buses and the only pan that I am
aware of sits under the steering column and protects the
accellerator and brake linkage.  If there is a pan that covers the
entire undercarriage, I've never seen it.  Both of my buses are
pretty intact stock, and neither of them have any pan that even
remotely runs the length of the vehicle and covers the beams and
crossmembers and such.... or maybe I am not understanding what a
belly pan is.  The only thing that protects my undercarriage is a
healthy coating of undercoat applied by the VW dealership when my
father was the original purchaser 27 years ago.  Is one of these
pans year specific?  Earlier buses certainly had better assembly and
quality of machining, that much is evident to anyone who has ever
taken apart a dash or window regulator on a TypeIIa bay vs. a
TypeIIb bay.  Hmmm.
