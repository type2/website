&gt;So, drop down to 20w as the owners' manual says,=20
&gt;Al Brase

For sure I agree with Al on that much (though I don't recall any bad data
ever coming out of the man). Also, know that you can call any VW dealer for
current recommendation. I suspect most will first offer, &quot;Use the
lubricants specified in your owner's manual.&quot; Why??? Because it is the
right answer!!! If 5w-50 doesn't show, consider the value of a more
economical carbon oil in the grade that best fits your clime as given in
the lubrication chart in the manual for your Bus.=20

Wasserboxers in the NW clime use 15/40, because it is the only one on the
chart that gives the best match for our coastal ranges of yearly temps. All
other grades are a bit shy on one end or the other. Know from the owner's
manual what is best on the chart for your year and engine. In most cases
you will find a multiweight that will serve year round. If your year
includes ambiant normal shifts of 100=B0 F during the year, you may well nee=
d
to change oil twice per year even if you use multiweights. But then again,
clean oil whether it needs it or not can't hurt your engine. =20

If you expect more than a few days of 0=B0 F in your winter, a block heater
is a good idea. Less wear and tear on not only the bearings, but the
starter/alt/batt are less strained by quick starting=3Dlast longer=3Dgood fo=
r
cost per mile. Just a 60 watt light bulb on the battery for warmth will
make a big difference at fridged temps. &quot;They&quot; make battery mats with
warming elements as well. Good stuff if you have 110v available.

Spec weight oil for nominal temps, and take the chill off the battery and
crankcase with a 40=B0 rise over ambient in fridged nights. Start right up i=
n
the morning every time.   =20

&gt;&gt; Hey with all of this talk about using different oil in the winter time I
was
&gt;&gt; wondering if it might be worth it to install a block heater.  They have=
 one
&gt;&gt; for a type 2 (71-79) at www.cip1_dot_com for $24.23.  It sounds pretty good=
 to
&gt;&gt; me but I was wondering if anybody has had any experiences with this kind=
 of
&gt;&gt; setup and if you would recommend it.  Cause with the block heater=
 couldn't
&gt;&gt; you use the same oil all year round and then have the optimum viscosity
&gt;&gt; level for both start up AND also when the engine has warmed up.
