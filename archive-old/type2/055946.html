Well, AFAIK, you'll have to live with it. &lt;G&gt;

I've been driving busses for 14 years in the worst conditions and your
only hope is good tires and good reflexes.

Personally, I LEARNED to drive in a VW Westie on state highway 14 going
down the Washington side of the Columbia river.  For those of you that
don't know, this is the wind surfing capital of the world!  My only 
suggestion is that if it gets too bad, slow her down.  If you STILL
can't keep it in your own lane, find a place to pull off the road and 
ride it out!  Type 2s are too light and too unaerodynamic to bull
through it.
