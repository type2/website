Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing Wheels - photos ?

&gt;anyone that has Mercedes or Audi rims on their bus,
&gt;
&gt;I would like to have a photo to see what they look like on a VW,
&gt;
&gt;also the size of the rim and any mounting problems,,,,
&gt;
&gt;they made so many rims for Mercedes , I am sure some fit the wheelwell
space
&gt;and some do not.....


here is a link to some pics of Mercedes wheels on a bus.

The 14&quot; on the red panel fit easily.  Only had to drill out the wheels as
Mercedes uses a 12mm studs instead of 14mm.

The 15&quot; chrome Mercedes wheels were a little more work.  We had to both
drill out the wheels and put longer wheel studs in.  I will post this
picture later on this evening.
