OK, its in and it works. Its just like the cruise control on any &quot;real&quot;
car. But..... Even if I had followed every step of the directions it
still would not have worked without some slight changes. The system I
put in is made by Audiovox and is available at Pepboys and JC Whitney
for about $100. I put it in a fairly stock 75 with stock injection and
manual trans. I did not have to use magnets on the drive shaft but auto
trans cars will need to. I hope to put up a web page with the details
in a week or so.

When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard-driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from forth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your hood in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw you off your stride....
