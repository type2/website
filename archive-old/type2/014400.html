Err, I have a 3/4 drive Chinese flex handle that has held my Dad + me 
bouncing on it with the aid of a 10' black gas pipe (among other 
atrocities), sailed through. I have a Chinese socket set that has been 
my &quot;main squeeze&quot; through the past five years, was purchased open box at 
a K-Mart that was being closed down, cost (I think) twelve bucks, came 
with a monster 11&quot; flex ratchet that I frequently bear on with all my 
strength, no failures ever. I have fixed a LOT of cars with it.

Admittedly &quot;all my strength&quot; may sound more formidable that it is in my 
particular circumstance, but still. =^ )

I believe the point of the thread was to try to help two young women who 
have purchased a bus, need tools to learn with, and have almost no 
money. Harbor Freight is carrying a 40-piece socket set for (read it) 
five DOLLars. It's probably not very good, but it is probably good 
enough. Open end wrench sets, 8 through 17 mm, six DOLLars. They're fine 
for the job at hand here IMO.

I am very tired of the televised Men on the Street proclaiming that some 
of our freedoms must be abridged to fight terrorism. That itself 
terrifies me. We must have more freedom now, not less. Liberty entails 
risks, but its contraries ensure disaster.
