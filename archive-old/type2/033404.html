Subject: y2k ....bus

speaksing of new buses...
take a look at some drawings i made a few months back, most of them are
of the new beetle, but i made a bus also, a pickup, limo, etc...i get
tons of compliments on the bus, and someone told me they send the link
to vw usa, im not sure about that, but the early sketch drawings i have
seen look a lot like it  :&gt;

now if they would just go back to the split window design but im sure
ralph nader would have a ball with that...
