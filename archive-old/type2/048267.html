Subject: [T2] 34pdsit dual carb question

Hi all, I've got a couple pairs of 34pdsit carbs and was considering trying 
to return my bus to sort of a stock setup.  The manifolds which I have EGR 
valves on the sides, my question is can I get these carbs to run without 
using EGR valves on the rest of the smog system that is supposed to go with 
it.  I'm missing the Mixture distribution assembly, and the EGR tube filter 
which also connects to the manifolds, when I look at the Bus boys catalog it 
shows the mixture distribution assembly with all sorts of things connected to 
it.  Is there anyone out there running these carbs without all this other 
stuff connected? And if so could you share this with me.  If anyone has an 
old 34pdsit setup lying around and would like to unload also let me know, 
everything but carbs themselves.  Thanks in advance.
