&gt; Maybe the Agilis-51 in 205/65 would
&gt; be better? Sami- do you want to try these out for us? :-)

William &amp; list,
I already bought 1 Conti Contact (CS21?) in a 205/65/15 and mounted it on
the 6x15 Fuchs. It looks great and fits (*barely* in the back with the 1&quot;
adapters), so I'll go ahead and buy the other 3 when the next paycheck comes
around.

However, I'm hesitant about using the adapters. Everytime I check them,
usually after only 10 miles (round trip to work) the lug nuts come off with
less torque than I used to fasten them! I'm not sure why, but one
possibility is that the holes in the adapters are not properly machined to
fit the spherical shape of the bus's lugnuts. The holes have more of a cone
shape. If anyone thinks that's a very likely reason, I may have a local
machine shop correct that. I could also experiment with Loctite, but the
warm'n fuzzy feeling just isn't there, especially as I'm carrying precious
cargo (one 2 and the other 4 years old). Or I may decide to do without
adapters, just redrill the hubs and drums in the back and replace the front
hubs and discs with those from a Porsche 944. That way the original offset
would also be much closer to stock. We'll see...

Cheers,

Sami
