&gt; together, to MAKE MY OWN CARPETS....?
&gt; 

A good project, actually. Here's what I would recommend.

Start with some plywood, and cut it slightly smaller than the floor pan, 
so you have 3 planks that cover the floor. Allow enough room at the 
edges, so you can &quot;roll&quot; the carpet over the edges, and still have room 
to slide them into place.

The carpet can be attached to the plywood with contact cement. Once you 
have the wood cut to size, simply take a scrap of carpet and use it to 
smear the glue onto the plywood. When it's dry, you can simply set the 
carpet into place, smoothing out wrinkes as you go. After it's in place, 
use a carpet knife (or a good sharp box knife) to cut the carpet at the 
corners, roll it over the edges, and staple or &quot;tack&quot; into place. You 
can now trim up the carpet even with the edge of the board.

When done, you'll have 3 separate panels that can be placed into the 
van, or lifted out for cleaning and/or hauling dirty loads. Furthermore, 
you can get under the carpet to clean up dirt and debris that collects 
in the floor &quot;grooves&quot;... and remove them if the inside gets wet.

When done properly, they will fit closely together and form a &quot;solid&quot; 
floor... and the ends won't fray.

BTW, my uncle, a carpet layer, began the interior of his van... and I 
finished the work when it became mine. The difference is that the entire 
van was covered in strips and pieces of carpet, covering the entire rear 
compartment, including the roof and walls. It was rather odd looking, 
but I liked the effect. (We put up some cheap paneling first, giving 
room for insulation inside the walls and ceiling.)  The van was not only 
MUCH warmer, but the noise levels were reduced to almost nothing (not 
counting wind noise, of course).  

For the floors of this van, we used 2 large panels of cheap rubber 
backed carpet. The floor carpet could be rolled up and vaccuumed off in 
the driveway, then rolled back into place.
