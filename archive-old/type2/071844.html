&lt;&lt; Hello People,
 
 I'm needing a new set of tires for my Myrtle...'77 Transporter.
 
 What is a good kind to put on a Bus???

i had the same question a few months ago...as all of us at one time or 
another have questioned this.  check the archives first then come back with 
some specific questions.  you might find what you need in there.
