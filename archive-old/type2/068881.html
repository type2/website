Subject: Re: Non mechanical types

&gt;As a young boy ... I never saw my
&gt;father ever attempt to repair any car. I had no friends who 'messed
&gt;around' with cars. In short, I grew up as a clean fingered, art loving
&gt;woos.

Me, too, except you might add nerd (including but not limited to computer
geek).
uestions for the list.
&gt;
&gt;1) Should I even bother? I can afford most of the repairs needed. Will I
&gt;get that much pleasure from my own graft?

There are many reasons to bother, especially with basic repairs and
maintainence.

Most mechanics suck, and are dishonest, and it is unpleasent to deal with
them, and they probably won't do the repair right anyway.  Opinions mine.
You (and all of us) are fortunate because it has been my experience that
many VW mechanics, at least AirCooled mechanics defy this rule.

Despite that, there is a bond you will form with your transportation that
is priceless.  Like Muir says of valve adjustments &quot;it's personal between
you and your transportation.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;2) If I am to enter this dark greasy world, what basic tools do I need?

See the Idiot's guide.  And no matter what, as you do more and more
complicated jobs, you will always discover there's another tool you need.
Don't sweat it, just head out to Sears and pick it up.

&gt;
&gt;3) What would be the first job I should attempt? I think my front wheel
&gt;bearings might be going out... When I corner at speeds over 20mph, I hear
&gt;a lower, sort of growly noise.

I dunno if this is wheel bearings but that's as good a guess as I could
make, except that usually wheel bearings make a noise all the time (or at
least all mine have).  Maybe CVs?

Nevertheless, I suppose that wheel bearings are as good a place as any to
start.  My first job was to rebuild the trans in a 1950 Ford pickup.  I did
it, and when it was over I had 3 pieces left over but it ran for about 100
miles.  The second time I sought advice and found out that many of the
components were'nt just dirty but were also worn.  As far as I know, that
trans is still running (sold it quite a while back, but still see it around
occaisonally)(FWIW, the Ford Flathead is the closest Americans came to the
VW aircooled motor (in spirit, not necessarily design)).

Good Luck!

and Go for it.
