Hi.

A few years back, I saw some engine tine that was teflon coated.  The engine 
tin was still in the box, from the facility that did the coating.

The mechanic who was going to put the engine tin on this specially built 
type 1 engine thought it was powder coated, but it obviously was NOT!!  You 
don't get that kind of rush by stroking your hand over the curves of cooling 
tin that was powder coated  ;-)

I called the facility that did the coating in Oklahoma City, OK (also have 
locations in Salt Lake City, Arizona, and other places like New Zealand and 
Australia) and the price is high, but not unreasonable (the gentleman at the 
facility remembered the job, and gave me exact prices on what was charged.  
I would estimate that type 4 tin would be about $350 - $400, based on his 
estimates.)

type  hpcoatings  in the url for the facility....
