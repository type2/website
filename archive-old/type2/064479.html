Subject: Corrosion protection

On the topic of rust,  what are you folks recommending?  I have a 73 Van
that is almost mint (all original with 70,000 miles) that has never seen
snow or salt.  It will die quickly here in Ottawa Ontario without
protection. I was considering Krown rustproofing.   Any comments?  What
about for my 90 Crew cab? 

Thanks, I am learning all kinds of stuff here.

Gary
