Subject: I bought a 75  westie today. Help
Message-ID: &lt;4c5e6ca8.2463a5d5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

It was offered by a guy that saw the sign in the clinic that said I was 
interested in VWs and VW parts. Production date 9/74

Anyway, I bought it, and is not too bad for a restoration effort but has no 
title or engine. Rust in the usual places,rockers etc. and a few small hits 
here and there. Really not bad, but what do you guys do with a no title bus? 
My suspect is that the tranny or something else went bad and it cost more to 
fix than the PO wanted to spend?? Who knows?

Has spent several years in a barn which headed off the rust a bit. Been 
outside two years. Pop top covered in crud so do not know what is under 
there, but looks OK. Canvas fairly good! Just a couple of small rips. 
Upstairs bed fabric gone.:-( Fridge also gone but water tank and small tire 
still there.

Hate to part out one as good as this but what to do without a title? Anybody 
really need some parts as this is where this thing is heading. :-( Now I know 
how VW boneyards get started.

Pray for Peace,
