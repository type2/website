&gt;With my lack of technical knowledge I don't know how it say it better: my 
&gt;bus is tired.  I have been told by several people, most who know less 
&gt;about busses than I do, and a few who profess to know more, that my '78 
&gt;Bus is just &quot;too old&quot; to be my daily driver, let alone take it on trips 
&gt;like Everybus (which unfortunately we have to skip this year, boo hoo.)

I've found it not very productive to spend my time listening to ignorant 
consumers.

&gt;I respect the age of my bus, but  it used to be able to have a fair amount 
&gt;of acceleration to pull out into traffic and could hit 75 on the highway 
&gt;if necessary.  Now it can barely go 50, had no acceleration and basically 
&gt;feels as if it is stuggling under a heavy weight.

It sounds like some maintenance is in order.

&gt;It has had a recent tune-up; all the fuel lines have been replaced 
&gt;(healthy fear of fires); I replaced the fuel filter and the air filter.  A 
&gt;cracked vacuum line was replaced, which helped only a tiny bit.  The 
&gt;timing is ok.  The compression is 120 all around.

Have you done a leak-down test?  The tool costs about $50, and requires an 
(at least low volume) air compressor.
This will tell you which valves and which piston rings are 
leaking.  Compression may look fine, even though there
is some serious leakage.

&gt;I will be heartbroken if I have to take it off the road;

Only if it burns, or has a tree or SUV fall on it.
