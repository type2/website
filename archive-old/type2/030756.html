Subject: '72 VW Camper for sale...$650.

Dear Type-2 Personality,

	A lonely '72 VW Camper resides just off Rt. 18 &amp; Rt. 1
in New Brunswick. It has has 81,000 original miles on it; 
the engine has less than 10,000 miles since its overhaul,
when it was bored out to 2000 cc. from 1800cc. on a whim of the
enthusiastic mechanic.  The leaky dual-carb setup was replaced
with a single Weber about 200 miles ago, and the engine is very peppy;
alas the vehicle has been sitting idle for some time, so some extra
TLC will be necessary.  
	The body is very solid and the interior very clean.
There is surface rust, but no structural problems from aging. 
	I would love to keep this baby, but I can't drive at
this time, and if I leave it sitting much longer unregistered,
I fear that my landlord will tow it away on me, and then it will
be of no use to anyone.
	Call me to arrange a visit.
	I don't think you'll be disappointed.

				Sincerely,
					Frank Miktus
					85-B Phelps Ave.
