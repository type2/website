The USA delivered Westys had the tank outside, some Federal safety rule I 
guess......

but they are considered &quot;freaks&quot; in Europe, no one had ever seen them before, 
and it was a real pain trying to get it filled, the Propane place in Bad 
Camberg would not do it....

I ended up filling it in Holland  where they had the right adapter...

most of the Euro campers use refillable/exchange Camping Gaz bottles
