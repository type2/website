Subject: Fairfield, CA, Scrapyards and BA4

I was at the Pick and Pull in Fairfield, CA this weekend, and managed to
pull a pristine looking BA4 out of an old Type 3?. - in 100+ degree heat
as well. - I'll know better next time.

Has anyone put one of these into a bus yet? - How did you do it?

While I was there I noticed the following easy picks....

a complete (minus FI) '79 bus engine - out of the bus.
a complete (minus FI and exhaust) Porsche 914 engine out of the car.

These were at the Fairfield Pick and Pull.

Dave.
--still searching for that '78 EGR switch and filter!
