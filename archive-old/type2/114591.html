Subject: Re: [T2] Custom Wheels

&lt;&lt; Has anybody had any success recently in finding custom alloy wheels to
fit their bus? My bus is a '79 Riviera with a 5-112 bolt pattern and I
can't find any wheels other than the stock ones. I'm looking for a 15,
16, or 17 inch wheel with a mid offset.  I've tried the American Racing
Aero, but the dust cover on the axle hub protrudes too far. Who makes a
wheel that fits out of the box?
 
Thanks &gt;&gt;

I've got Mercedes-Benz alloys on my Bus (79), but you've got to hog the
bolt holes out by 1/16 to fit the VW studs and use a ball grinder to dish
the steel inserts to accept the VW acorn lug nuts. At the back a slight
relief is needed to clear the 10 MM bolt heads that hold the drums in
place. The offset is close to the stock wheel. I would guess that the
wheels that fit the M-B pattern should fit the VW, but an offset might
scrape at the rear... ??
