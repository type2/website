&gt;How many are splitties, though? It would be good to know there is an
&gt;abundance of these somewhere. I'm guessing there aren't 50 of
&gt;these vans left in Eugene/Springfield... or they are VERY well hidden.
&gt;You see one about every 2 weeks.

Honestly, how many pre-68 car of any make and model do you see driving
around?  Except for pickups, what I see the most of _are_ VWs, if not
exclusively busses.

$2/100
