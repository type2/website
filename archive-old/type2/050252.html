Subject: [T2] Re CV knocking

Dallas,
Not to contradict what Isaiah said but I'd be careful with a noisy CV joint
and drive cautiously. If you are roaring down the freeway at say 55mph and
that CV decides to let go.. well use your imagination. Just think of sort of
a hammer spinning at many many rpm until you get it stopped. If you have any
sort of a wrecking yard near you maybe a spare axle would be prudent? Good
luck!
