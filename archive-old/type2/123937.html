Subject: Re: [T2] 1980 vanagon questions

Well, maybe the 1980 Vanagon is different from my 1981 and 1982 models.

Despite the fact that I've looked at the components of the Vanagon engine
many, many times, being challenged by Billy, I went out and looked under
both vans.  Both vans have fan housing have no external &quot;ports&quot;; they're
essentially air-tight boxes.  The only outlets for the air sucked into the
fan housings are ones that you can't see, under the tin, where air is
directed to the heads.

I then looked carefully at the heat exchangers, on both my California and
Federal vans.  All of then have a port or ports for taking in hot exhaust.
The right side exchanger on both &quot;flavors&quot; of vehicles and left side
exchangers on the Federal van introduce exhaust into them via integral
headers.  The left side exchanger on the California van only has a single
port for the introduction of exhaust since the header is separate on
California vehicles.  They also have ports where the exhaust exits, either
to the crossover pipe or directly to the muffler.  They all have a port that
goes up into the engine compartment - this connection is called &quot;connection
for warm air fan&quot; in Bentley - and a port that goes forward to the cabin.
This latter connection is called &quot;connection for heater&quot; in Bentley.  No
connection that I could see to the engine's main cooling fan.

 I next grabbed my Clymer Vanagon manual and read about the heating system:

&quot;A Squirrel cage (heater blower) fan is bolted to the alternator and driven
by the alternator belt.  This fan blows air to the heat exchangers.  The hot
air from the heat exchangers is allowed to flow through the system by 2
flaps controlled by cables from the vehicle dashboard.  Hot air leaving the
engine area is routed under the vehicle via a duct to the front warm air
distributor where it enters the interior.&quot;

Hmmm... no mention of the main cooling fan or ports in the heat exchangers
there.

I've turned on the *3* - speed fan up in the cabin maybe a thousand times
and never felt a lick of increase in warm air.  But, covering all bases, I
went and grabbed my Owner's Manual and flipped to the Climate Controls.
Yes, it's a 3-speed switch, at least according to the manual, and affects
&quot;Fresh Air Ventilation.&quot;

I dunno, it seems like I got it right but, like I said, maybe the 1980
Vanagon is different than what I've got.

&gt;
&gt; Karl says about type4 aux. heater blower/main fan:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;No, not all the HEAT air comes from the plastic &gt;&gt;fan. That's just a
helper fan to keep the &gt;&gt;alternator cool and send air up front at idle.
&gt;&gt;Above idle, the big metal engine fan sends the heat &gt;&gt;up front.
&gt;
&gt; Which is totally correct.  But Tom, despite the recent Von Salzen holiday
decree, contradicts thusly:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;No, that's the cooling fan for the engine and has no &gt;connection to the
heating system.
&gt;
&gt; Tom, you better take a look at the bottom of your fan housing and see the
little rectangular ports that supply air to the heater boxes.  It DOES
supply the majority of air to the heating system just as the upright fan did
on the type1's.
&gt;
&gt; It also does what you mention below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;It pulls cool air in from the engine compartment; &gt;the air circulates
past the heads and cylinders and &gt;exits below the engine.
&gt;
&gt; Wait a minute:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The metal fan inside the plastic housing attached to &gt;the alternator is
driven
&gt; &gt;&quot;coordinated&quot; with the cooling fan since there's a &gt;belt connecting the
two.
&gt;
&gt; Well, its the alternator belt, which mainly turns the alternator, but the
fan in the alt. as well, by default.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As engine speed picks up
&gt; &gt;the heating fan also speeds up, sending more warm
&gt; &gt;air up front.
&gt;
&gt; Are you talking abou the aux. fan speeding up?
&gt; No it doesn't.  It is single speed on/off electrical in everyway.
