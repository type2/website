&gt;OK try this one. Just got back from Spain and a very rough crossing on the
Bay of Biscay. Well I thought it was rough and the ground is still going up
and down 3 days later. 

We got about 20 miles up the road and there was a real strong smell of gas,
and sure enough it was dripping out of the fuel pipe to the right hand carb
right onto the heat exchange. 

I tightened it up and went another 90 miles and it came back. This time the
pipe had almost blown off and was squirting quite fast. What happened was
that I'd put some new hosing on before the trip and the clamp was tightened
up to the max but this still wasnt enough. I think the sea voyage had shaken
the van around and it had come loose and now it wouldn't tighten up.

Eventually cured it with some tape under the clamp to give it more to work
on, and also wired it in as well, but you nearly had one less camper (and
driver) in your ranks.
