Subject: Re: [T2] solex 34 pict 3 tuning/timing

When I got my 56 Beetle (with 1600 AH block) it had a 009 dist. with
electronic ignition and of course 34 PICT 3 carb. It was timed at 30 degrees
total advance which was around 8-9 degrees BTDC at idle. It ran OK but
always had a flat spot that I couldn't get rid of. I tried going back to
points, different timings, etc. Finally I bought a new vacuum advanced dist.
from California Imports
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D043%2D905%2D205  ,
drilled out the pop rivet in the throttle plate, timed to 5 degrees ATDC ,
readjusted the carb, and now it works great and runs about 10 degrees
cooler.

Bus content: I ran out of gas today in my 79 panel !_at_#$% !!!
