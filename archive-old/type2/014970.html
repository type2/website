&gt;     Has anywone installed a front tire carrier on a 78 Westy?  How do
&gt;you get to the place to drill for the bolts that pass from the inside to
&gt;the outside?

They are called &quot;jack bolts&quot; and are available in several sizes from
better-stocked hardware stores.  Properly installed, they will support as
much weight as a nut and bolt of similar size.
