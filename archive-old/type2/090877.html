Subject: New Bus fan

hello everyone, Some of you know Troy Wicals (troy_at_wicals_dot_com) from
either HCBF, Everybus, Type2 list or Type2 irc server. Well his
girlfriend gave birth to a bouncing baby boy Cameron (sp?) this
morning 9lbs-11oz. So I'm just passing this info along to the lists.
Just in case this isn't bus related (T2 list) guess what guys? She
delivered in the back of his 78 bus, right in the emergency drop-off.
Way to go troy. I'm sure he will post some more details for those
interested later when he gets back to a computer.
