----SNIP---+AD4-These appear to be 3/8+ACI- bolts? Should they not be
metric?
----SNIP---(reply) on my 79, I have three 17mm bolts, ---SNIP----

Just a note - the bolts are not 17mm bolts because they use a 17mm socket
on the hex (17mm hex).  If they are approximately 3/8&quot; then they are M10
(10mm dia.) bolts.  
The standard pitch (thread spacing) is 1.50mm for M10 - referred to as
M10-1.50   Finer pitches are used such as 1.25mm and 1.0mm, however, this
is very unlikely for a bumper bolt.  For the most part VW uses standard
pitches, an exception I noted is the flywheel bolts on my type 4 motor -
a finer pitch than standard. there may be others in the internal engine.

If you want anymore ramblings about threads, feel free to contact me
