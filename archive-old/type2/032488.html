Alright Y'all,
What the heck is this thing, Here's the photo link: http://www.geocities_dot_com/jbakerccymca/whatzit

All this time I have been under the impression that the mystery box before my starter was a voltage drop (6 V converted to 12 volt '66 bus).  After posting earlier, Matt Roberds gave me some info saying that a voltage drop would have 2 wires attached.  So I crawl back under there and look, this thing is hanging by 1 wire that is attached to the terminal on my starter solenoid.  Upon closer inpection there are 3 posts on it and only the one is attached.  My ignition switch has been re-wired byb PO so you start the bus by pushing a button (goofy, I know)  ANy way it starts fine this way (most of the time)  So is this thing an old hard start relay that was by-passed when the PO did that push button ignition thing???



Peace, John Baker
