&gt; One thing that happened after I wrote that article was that the switch I
&gt; bought and installed from BD became very intermittent.  I had to do it all
&gt; over again a month later, but this time I installed a used original VW
&gt; switch.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been working fine for many years now.
&gt; 

In my experience the aftermarket switches are not very good. I've seen them
be bad right out of the box, almost like the mechanical part from the key
side of the switch assembly not being a tight enough fit in the aftermarket
electrical switch. The ones from VW are good, but they cost 3x as much.
