Subject: [T2] juicy butt fart story


&gt;     Once upon a time, there was a juicy butt fart. He was the juiciest
butt
&gt; fart in all the colon. He dreamed of someday being the juiciest butt fart
&gt; the world had ever known. He helped little old ladies cross the street, he
&gt; would run into burning buildings and rescue people, and he even read to
the
&gt; blind on Sundays. He was a good juicy butt fart. His mother always told
him,
&gt; &quot;You be good, and nothing can stop you from being the juiciest butt fart
in
&gt; the world.&quot; Nearby in a large piece of corn, there lived a evil carbunkle
&gt; named Evil Carbunkle, the evillest carbunkle in the colon. He hated the
&gt; juicy butt fart with all his soul. He knew the juicy butt fart needed to
be
&gt; taken down a peg or two. He would try to out do the juicy butt fart with
his
&gt; own juicy butt farts. But, alas, his butt farts were never quite juicy
&gt; enough. Finally, when word of the juicy butt fart's plans of introducing
&gt; himself to the world emerged, Evil Carbunkle concocted a plan to stop the
&gt; juicy butt fart. Evil Carbunkle gathered all the cheese, bread dough, and
&gt; pasta that he could find in all the tracts of Digestion he could find. He
&gt; made a huge beaver dam like butt plug and placed it over the anus. He
&gt; laughed maniacally, because as all Carbunkle's before him they laughed
this
&gt; way too. He hid behind a piece of celery nearby and waited. Along came the
&gt; juicy butt fart, occassionally shining the silver buckles on his patent
&gt; leather shoes. He stopped with a start, much easier than starting with a
&gt; stop, at the sight of the large butt plug. Then he shrugged, split into a
&gt; thousand little juicy butt farts, with shiny silver buckled shoes and all,
&gt; and they crawled around the butt plug's edges. Rejoining on the other side
&gt; of the plug, they rejoiced before joining back into the single juicy butt
&gt; fart. &quot;Curses, foiled again!&quot;, yelled Evil Carbunkle. The juicy butt fart
&gt; ran out of the butthole and soon became the juiciest butt fart in the
world.
&gt; But that's another juicy butt fart story...
&gt;
&gt; Moral: No matter how hard you try, sometimes you just can't keep back a
good
&gt; juicy butt fart.
