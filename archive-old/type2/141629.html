Subject: RE: [T2] Btlmex closing

&gt; Try calling 'Small Car Connection' in Hesperia, CA for the
&gt; Mexican SVDA distributor.  If they don't have them, they
&gt; should be able to tell you who does.


Richard was referencing a replacement vacuum advance, not the whole
distributor.  I do have those, but they're more like $40 because I get them
from Bosch/USA.

I also have the complete SVDA vacuum advance distributors in stock. Mine are
genuine Bosch, not the Chinese-made-ones-with-a-German-sounding-name that
certain other vendors are selling. :-)
