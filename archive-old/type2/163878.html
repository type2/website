&gt; If you had avoided the connubial cunnilingis and stayed on the Bus--you

Agreed, I'll not easily get out of the predicament now, though.

&gt; The paint with reducer and hardener is going to cost more than $300.00

I was quoted PPG Omni, its a bit cheaper.  Its still more than I can
spare right now, though.

&gt; What's wrong with inside storage?

The $80/month - that's whats wrong with it.

Thanks again,
Ken
