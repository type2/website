&gt; Tonight's question is what should my manifold vacuum be at idle?

I like mine to be over 15&quot; at 8-900RPM  on most gauges with premarked
dials, this is the bottom end of acceptable, or maked &quot;late ingintion
timing&quot; and it is true... by the standards of water cooled engines, our
timing is very late.  On most engines, the timing spec is to advance it
'til it stumbles, then back it off a bit.  If you try this with a VW, you
will toast that pup in minutes!

&gt; I am getting 14 PSI on my gauge connected with a T into the vacuum
&gt; port that supplies the fuel regulator.

I think this is the right place... that line goes to the air dist box
between the runners for cylinders 1&amp;2, yes?

&gt; Question 2 is my distributor vacuum connected to the correct port on the
&gt; throttle? It's connected to the port facing the rear of the bus on the
&gt; throttle body. There is another facing the front that is capped off.
&gt; This is a 75 FI setup

Hang on, let me check.... (runs down to look for his spare throttle
body...)  drat... can't find it and the vanaagon has too much crap in the
back to pull it apart tonight...

OK, I *think* you have it correctly connected, but to be *sure*, do
this...  hook your vacuum gauge to each of the ports.  One will have a
high vacuum at idle, dropping like a shot duck when you goose the
throttle.  This is manifold vacuum and would go to vacuum *retard* if you
had it.  The other port will have minimal vacuum at idle (2-3&quot;) at idle,
and will rise quickly when you goose the throttle.  That one is ported
vacuum and goes to the vacuum *advance*.  OK?
