&gt; So, You assume the rods to be ok.................interesting.replacing
&gt; lifters on a hydraulic motor is tricky?  Please explain
&gt; this...................I could do them all in probably 2 hours max in the
&gt; car, including pumping them up.
&gt;
&gt; Earlier, you said replace lifters and made no mention of the
&gt; cam.....................Which is it?

To be redundant, i earlier stated that &quot; replacing lifters
is tricky business, you may need a cam &quot;.
This means that you may find the cam needs replacing.
This requires the case to be open.
Replacing only the lifters is not always the best answer.


I don't assume the rods to be anything, you verify
the bottom through deductiove reasoning. If there is
excellent oil pressure and the case has not been
overheated or abused and has a history of proper
maintenance and if you believe your diagnosis
warrants top-end rebuild, and you trust your own
judgement,go for it.
It's not always necessary to buy a new engine
when confronted with a minor repair.
Where do YOU draw the line ?!
( Different STROKES for different folks :).
