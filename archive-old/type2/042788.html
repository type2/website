&gt; Dude!  That's the whole point of superthumpin' bass, man!  Especially if
&gt; you can get those long beltline trim strips to rattle at stoplights.  If
&gt; you got no rattles, MAKE SOME!  Yo, how else will people know you have a
&gt; killer system?
&gt; 
&gt; And sit real low in the seat, your head to one side, elbow way out the
&gt; window.  You're *way* too cool to drive from a comfortable and efficient
&gt; position!
&gt; 
&gt; Geez, I have to keep after you guys or you'll lose your hipness
&gt; altogether.

Oh geeze...next thing I know you guys are going to be bolting low-profile
12&quot; tires (with standoffs so the brakes will fit) and welding the suspension
as low as it will go. I know a couple of nutball chiropractors who will love
you for life...
