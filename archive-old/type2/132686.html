Hi Richard,

Another point... Note that the law requires &quot;Collector's Insurance&quot;, 
which usually severely limits the use of the vehicle. No more than a 
few thousand miles per year, box stock, driven only to car shows, etc. 
etc, etc.

Nice of the legislators to pass the regulation of &quot;Collector Car&quot; over 
to the in$urance Indu$try, rather than to define it themselves.


Happy trails,

&gt; You missed my point slightly. I'm saying these cars will have a minimal

&gt;
&gt; Collector cars don't all grow in Barns. They are restored to original
&gt; condition often by the substitution of parts from donor vehicles. The 
&gt; less
&gt; donor vehicles there are due to the fact they went to the crusher after
&gt; failing smog the fewer collector vehicles there will be.
