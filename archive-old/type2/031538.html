&gt; &gt;one. the turn signals and emergency flashers on my 70 Westy all work fine,
&gt; &gt;but the Turn signal indicator lights on my dash both *blink* when I use my
&gt; &gt;turn signals. Left or right makes no difference, they both flash, while the
&gt; &gt;operation of the outside lights is correct. Anybody have this happen?
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone, I think.  This is normal behavior.  :)

yup I think this is normal on all of em, at least that I'm aware
of....some years ago it was bugging me and tried to figure out how to make
em blink left/right like I thought they should....it finally looked like
more wiring and work than I thought it was worth and dropped the idea

YMMV
