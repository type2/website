Subject: Re: [T2] Powder coating - more

Courtney,
All you need is the first HARD application of the brakes to generate enough heat
to soften the paint,, then the wheel passes you down the mountain,,

I know that brakes reach RED HOT in extreme braking,,,  please be a good scout,
and be prepared for everything, :-)

&gt; Powder coating melts at 425-450 degrees F. so if your rims are getting that
&gt; hot around the bolts because of your drums or discs, I would suggest that
&gt; you have problems. Perhaps someone with a temp gun can shoot a reading off a
&gt; lugnut and let us know? I would REALLY doubt my lugnuts are getting anywhere
&gt; near that temp.
