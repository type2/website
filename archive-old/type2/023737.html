Hi,
	Jim Hood asks about lowering to improve handling in the twisties.

 I'd tend to agree with George (surprise!) that you can probably achieve
what you
want without lowering.

 First place to look is tyres: if you don't have the right tyres on your
bus then any suspension mods will be a waste of time, as they'll just
make the inadequate rubber work harder, and it's not up to the job 
already.
 There are endless threads in the archive and the library. It'll suffice to
say here that high spec. commercial vehicle tyres (99S or 102R for example,
sometimes known as &quot;Load range D&quot;) will provide a big improvement, don't
trust the tyre-store jockeys to know what you need (let alone what you 
want) because they very likely won't.

 After that, look to stiffer anti-roll bars, heavy duty shocks, or 
possibly larger wheels (which would mean different tyres, and isn't
as straightforward as you would expect).

Cheers,
	 W.
