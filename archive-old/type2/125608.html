Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia fabric 

&gt;  WHAT'S NEW AT WOLFSBURG
&gt; 1973-1979 Westfalia upholstery material, plaid pattern
&gt; fabric  Late model Westy owners' rejoice! We have just
&gt; completed a production run of original-style upholstery
&gt; fabric for the 1974-1979

&gt; Missing is the 74/75 pumpkin orange plaid.



Actually, they all seem to be missing, at least for now;  Wolfsburg's
website lists them all as &quot;not in stock.&quot;

I already carry (and have for some time) the actual German Westfalia plad
fabric for '76-79, in two flavors - the green plaid for Sage Green campers,
and the yellow/orange for Chrome Yellow campers.  I will eventually have the
other plaids as well. But perhaps not as soon as Wolfsburg will; while
theirs is a repro, mine comes from the original German supplier and they are
slow to produce.

Links for the genuine ones currently available...
