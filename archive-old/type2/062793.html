Subject: OK, Someone took the flame bait...

OK, Someone took the flame bait that I set out regarding the exporting of
all of the VWs to &quot;Japan.&quot;

Firstly, I am far from a racist. I have nothing against any ethnicity,
nationality, gender or &quot;lifestyle preference.&quot; I will admit to a slight
dislike toward my over hyper schnauzer dog and any little terrier type that
refuses to sit still for one second. Grrrrr~ruff! (Chill dog! Chill!) ;-0

Secondly, I see the point as a the fundamental differences between import
and export, hobby vs. blatant commercialism. If any country chooses to
*Export* VWs or (most) any other product **onto** the North American
Continent, then cool! I have a BIG exception toward the folks who are mostly
US citizens (coincidentally Anglo of which I am also) who are into the VW
circuit only/mostly for sheer capital gain and who are flat out
DEPLETEING/DISSAPATING the number of VWs of all types/models within my
continent for as long as they are available and then will move on to another
&quot;thing&quot; to sell. Contrast this with the persons who either desire to own,
drive, and enjoy the vehicles (vintage or custom) as they were intended and
the commercial vendors (swap meet hippie or corporation)who help to preserve
and retain/maintain these vehicles. Without the SUPPORT vendors we all would
be in for a short lived hobby.

I don't see a double standard. I see our hobby being pissed away to foreign
shores to be placed in museums/collections of very wealthy investors. I
suspect that these collections are rarely seen even by their country's men
and women.
It's a matter of what is good for the greatest number of folks vs. the gain
of a few. Do I want the Nor Am continent to get to the point where it is
beyond rare to see ANY pre 68 VW on the road? No! Do I want all of my
vendors to go out of business due to lack of vehicles/clientele? No!
The differences between the VW scene as late as 1990 and today is stark! The
local paper regularly had some type of cool 68 and older find in it ~ in
half decent shape. Today it is rare to find anything older than a mid run
bay. When you track them down they have been either used and abused to the
point of worthlessness or they are priced obnoxiously high. Dissipation
(hoarding and exporting ) of the parts have driven prices through the roof!
The over all attendance and quality of the shows are pathetic compared to as
late as 1994. Soon we will have nothing left but a couple of dwarfs with
K.M.A. attitudes selling fuses and dented hubcaps for thousands of dollars.
&lt;did you know that many FLAPS no longer sell the common red and white fuses
any longer? ~ check it out!&gt;

Go ahead and do your &quot;Sales&quot; thing. Go ahead and ignore the red flag that I
am waving. Wait five years then go to the book store and buy a book or CD so
you can read about what owning and driving a vintage VW was like. I will be
driving mine.
I place value in the &quot;experience&quot; et al. of driving and maintaining a VW
over the value that I can suck out of a resource until its gone.
