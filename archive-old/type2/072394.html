I just got a 79 Westfalia last year and now I'm committing myself to 
fixing it up. I have looked at all the sites out there and got most 
of the catalogs. Can anyone give me some advice on getting the best 
deals on parts (mostly interior parts for now) and/or somewhere that 
has been extremely helpful and good customer service (good customer 
service is a plus in my book)? I haven't bought anything yet so I 
haven't had any experiences (good/bad) with any of the dealers.

thanks.
todd.
