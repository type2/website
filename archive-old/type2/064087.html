Subject: '74 bus timing and distributor

My '74 1600 Devon camper (thats an English conversion to a
basic Kombi) revs reasonably well, but idles roughly despite a
rebuilt carb, etc.  When I try to set the timing dynamically at
idling speed, turning the distributor by hand  with my strobe on, I
can't get the notch in the lower pulley far enough clockwise
(retarded) to meet the crankcase joint timing point. About 10
degrees short the engine stops. 

Are there different pulleys that might have been fitted? What else
might be the matter? The engine has been changed, I have an AD prefix
when I think it should have an AS prefix for the year .  The  Haynes
manual says these have very different ignition timing, or is it just the
timing marks that differ?

Also, I see a lot of reference to 009 distributors.  What is the 
advantage of getting one?  Will a stock engine rev better?

I'm new to air-cooled VWs so perhaps some of you experts can help!
