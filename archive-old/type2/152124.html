Fall is in the air,  you can tell the thread turns to cheap heat.


&gt; Has anyone tried or used the 12v ceramic heaters?  - like the ones on the

they don't work, period.... your alternator/generator can't make enough
volts/amps to ever heat that bus with anything electric....

heating the seat is possible but not the air just your butt.

gotta go fuel fired, gas/propane/diesel etc.
