        Sorry Bob, old VWs are not automaticly 'Gross Polluters'. Pre-'66
have NO standards at all. '71-'74 (last of the uprights) Gross Polluter 
standards are:

&lt;1100 rpm:                      ~2500 rpm:
800pmm HC, 7.5% CO              650ppm HC, 6.5% CO

'66-'70 have even looser limits. These are HUGE limits.

        Actuals on my new '70 1600 single-port rebuild were

195ppm HC,  4.95% CO            26ppm HC,  0.17% CO

Pass limits for my '70 are

650ppm HC,  5.5% CO             600ppm HC,  4.5% CO

Only CO-at-idle uses over 30% of the available spec, which you
would expect. Its a new engine. With a check of the mixture adjustment
every 2 years or so, I fully expect 75-100K miles out of this engine,
which cost $1700 turnkey, at my door, new carb, new generator, 
exchanged case + crank + rods. No rocket science, no jack-booted thugs.

        Smog laws are going to be hardest for people with early smog 
equipment- 73-76/7, air pumps in particular. Manufacturers didn't get 
is right the first time and even VW (gasp) did only the barest minimum 
that it had to do, so stuff changes every year, spare parts are hard to 
find and the systems are probably sub-optimal.

        Peace.
        Bill
