I am buying my first bay today!  It needs a few odd items, though.

Heat exchangers and the tubes/flappers that connect them to the
ductwork..........and here is the most obscure

The A/C compressor/bracket setup.  The a/c is complete from the front to
where the compressor went on this 1700 motor.  I want to try to adapt it to
a sanden compressor.

I have a buddy that used to install the a/c for vw back in the 70's.......he
feels we could make it live!
