Subject: carpet kits??
Message-ID: &lt;378751EA.53204F69_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

hello
    has anyone installed a carpet kit??
i just purchased one and should be getting it soon. the questions that i have are
how does one use the carpet nails?? i thought there would be some kind of adhesive
spray instead.  also is there some kind of pad that one puts under the carpet,
seeing as the bus floor is somewhat rippled.

thanks
eric
