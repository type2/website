When you replaced the clutch disc, did you also replace the needle
bearings located in the end of the crankshaft?  The inputshaft of the
transmission rides in this assembly.

If they are bad they will drag the input shaft, causing hard shifting as
well as grinding noises. (much like haivng the clutch out while
shifting..)


Consult the Bentley for more information on replacing the bearings.

good luck.
