Don Bowman sends:

&gt; '78 type 4 FI engine (california model). Approx 140K miles on engine,
&gt; unrebuilt.
&gt; 
&gt; When the engine is cold (eg first started, its not really cold, maybe 15C),
&gt; the oil pressure is quite high, ~55psi on the gauge. The head temp cranks to
&gt; its normal operating temp quite quickly, but the manifold temp takes a long
&gt; time to come up (and drops fast when the load is off the engine). The oil
&gt; pressure stays high until after about 15 minutes of road-driving operation,
&gt; then it rapidly (instantly) drops to normal, ~29psi. Its running 10W40.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the catch is, it didn't really do this last year. Or if it did, I didn't
&gt; notice it for some reason.

140k on a Bus motor? You, sir, have impeccable car care skills.

The oil pressure control valves (you need a flattip screwdriver with a tip
an inch wide to get these out) are in the bottom of your engine case. I
think they're just crudded-up. Go under your Bus and look on the bottom of
your engine for the two screws that this screwdriver will fit and remove one
of them. Under it will be a very strong spring and a metal slug. Drain the
oil first. Remove one valve, clean it and the hole it went into, put it back
in (use a little screwdriver to push the slug up and down to ensure it has
free travel), and remove/clean the other one. You'll need a rich assortment
of obscenities to get these in because that spring makes it hard to do. This
should fix the problem.
