Subject: Re: [T2] Re:dwell time of Hot-Spark pointless ig-why 56-60deg?

Interesting. Do you know if the 2nd generation pertronix that has variable
dwell is increasing duty cycle at higher rpm?


&gt; Longer dwell is not necessarily a longer spark, although it may be more
&gt; powerful. &quot;Dwell&quot; is a measure of the period the coil is powered -
&gt; allowed to build a magnetic field. The setting can be critical for
&gt; points, since too much/little can cause the points to &quot;burn,&quot; or
&gt; prevent a good spark. There are no points to burn in &quot;electronic
&gt; points,&quot; so the dwell time can be increased, which gives the coil time
&gt; to store more energy, which is in turn released in a stronger spark.
&gt; This is most apparent at higher RPM, where the actual charge time is
&gt; smaller.
