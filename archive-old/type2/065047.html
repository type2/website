Subject: '71 Ignition switch

Hi Volks,

New to this list.  I've got a question about replacing the
ignition switch on the '71 Type 2.  Apparently John Muir had
the same exact problem.

Can one get to it by merely taking off the underneath panel
of the switchbox itself, or (as the Haynes manual seems to
suggest) does one need to take off the instrument panel also ?

Thanks in advance for ANY tips on this !!

Regards,

John A.     :0)
