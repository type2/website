Subject: [T2] Another VW? Am I nuts

Howdy All!
Only 3 days after buying a 71 super beetle for my wife, today I happened upon a sad looking 73 Westy for sale.  I thought it could be a parts bus for my 75 Riviera.  However I come to find out that the engine sounds great and the body, other than ugly mottled orange paint, is in relatively decent shape with only scattered surface rust. The lady said she never had any problems with and it ran great...until tonight when I came to look at it.  The battery was dead, I mean dead, no dash lights, no starter clicking.  We jumped it and it fired right up and ran and sounded great as long as I kept my foot on the accelerator.  However, once the gas let up it died, and then NOTHING again.  Jumped again, ran it for a good 5 minutes to charge the battery, let off the gas, stalled, completely dead again!  So here are my questions: 1)Does this sound like a bad generator? 2)How much of a pain in the a$$ is replacing it if it is, and 3)any suggestions about how much $ I should offer a really !
!
neat lady for a 73 westy in average condition (dirty interior, ruined canvas top) with a GREAT sounding engine and a bad generator??
