Um, no.  The ice is the result of humidity condensing from the air
inside the fridge onto the cold coils.  No matter how the air is
circulated, the moisture will eventually find the coils and stick
there as ice.  This situation is worse in humid conditions and if you
open the fridge a lot (every time you open it, the cold air dumps out
and is replaced with warm air from outside)

The only way to get rid of frost buildup is to shut down the
refrigerator and defrost it, just like back in the 'ol days.

There is also a fan that mounts behind the refrigerator that moves air
past the hot side of the system.  I find that this is a big help when
the temps are 100+
