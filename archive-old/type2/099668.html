Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch just stopped working, Help

&gt;The clutch in my 78 Volks just stopped working. The
&gt;pedal now goes to the floor with only a little action
&gt;actually getting to the clutch. Not enough slippage to
&gt;shift gears. I'm guessing its something in the linkage
&gt;but its raining and I cant look till the morning. Any
&gt;ideas what goes out most frequently on these. Is it
&gt;linkage?

Worst case the cross shaft has failed that actuates the throw-out bearing.

Or the pressure plate has failed (unlikely IMHO). Either way out comes the 
engine.

Start with the pedal and cable since they are easiest. Maybe 80% of the 
strands in the clutch cable failed and the remaining 20% stretched?
