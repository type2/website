Subject: Re: really stupid (squeaks)

Hi Kevin,

I had that problem, and it turned out to be one of the shocks.  I fixed it by
squirting oil up between the concentric cylinders.  I found the problem by
having a friend rock the bus while I stuck my head under the bus to listen.
Got a friend?

But like you, now I have another squeak, this one also in the front but more
central.  It only happens in rare, and so far unpredictable, circumstances and
never when there's a friend around, at least none willing to bounce up and
down on a bus.  It's annoying, sure, but not nearly as annoying as half a
dozen other things I'm trying to fix on the bus.  Fortunately, I haven't been
tempted by Fords since I was a kid.

Good luck with yours.

See you on the road,
Jerry
