Hi Volks
Hoping for some helpful insight here.
Our 72 bus with 75 running gear(fuel injected) has been doing something
strange.
After driving on the hwy for about 40 minutes on my way to work (sub freezing
temps) I park at the coffee shop and go in for coffee. When I come out  2
minutes later it turns over but won't fire. The first time it happened I went
in to make the phone call to work to let them know I may be late. I returned
to the van to troubleshoot and as I was about to go around back with tools I
tried it one more time and it started.
Did the same thing this morning but it started sooner.
Any ideas?
TIA
Brian
