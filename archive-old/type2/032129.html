Hi, folks: 

I've got a 12-volt dual heater fan kit from J.C. Whitney that's been
sitting in a box for quite awhile, not doing anyone any good. It's time
for somebody to put it to work, and [at least in the northern hemisphere]
it's the season for improving heating systems, so:

The kit is missing some generic stuff you can get from the FLAPS [air
hose, hose clamps, one of the two three-way switches, crimp connectors
etc.]. 

But it has the essentials: both fans, both fan housing plugs, both PVC
fittings for the end of the air hose, both 16 amp fuses and holders, AND
all directions [for Beetles and Type 2's] including photos and the cut-out
template for the firewall.  I'm asking $65 plus postage for the whole
thing.

best
