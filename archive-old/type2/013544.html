&gt; What's the size of the BIG steering wheel nut under the horn button?  
&gt; Do I need a puller for the wheel after the nut is off?

27mm, IIRC.

Nope, just give it a good whack from below with your thighs.

Someone posted a month or two ago about loosening the nut, then whacking 
the steering wheel
from the underside to break the seal, then removing the nut.  this means 
you don't accidentally
hit yourself in the head with the steering wheel when it pops off.
