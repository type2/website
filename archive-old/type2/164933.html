Subject: RE: [T2] weird oil cooler

Hmmm, looks cool, but you are right, I also don't think sucking hot air from
the copper piping into the cooling fan is such a hot idea (if you excuse the
puns). Even worse, the engine warms faster than the oil, so when the heads
are nice and hot, the oil catches up and suddenly your head temps skyrocket.
Looks nice on an engine stand though.

There is plenty of oil pressure to push oil through all those lines though.
My external oil filter reaches 190psi when cold (20W-50). I had to install a
EMPI in-line 180 degree thermostat to keep my oil filter from leaking. I was
bursting oil filters, but I found out the &quot;mechanic&quot; plumbed the hoses
backward! I may remove the thermostat for summer use though.

Also found out you have to use extremely high pressure hydraulic line with
external filters. 250psi minimum. I used lesser rated lines and lost all my
oil going to work one day. Sometimes I think I have lost more oil working
out the bugs in my project than I have added fuel!

Hi Volks,

Someone sent me a link today wherein I saw the strangest oil cooler  
setup I have ever come across:
http://photos.imageevent_dot_com/mrokrasa/flat4s36hpokrasaengine//Complete 
%2036hp%20Okrasa%20rear%203-4%20view.jpg

or http://tinyurl_dot_com/25yv8r

Now, is it just me or is this thing going to require major oil  
pressure to keep oil flowing through it with all the bends and drag  
from the tubing?

But even when you find a way to keep the pressure up; the heat from  
the oil is going directly into the stream of air used to cool the  
engine. Which will make the oil even hotter....

I think someone wasn't thinking clearly when they designed this.


Happy Trails,
