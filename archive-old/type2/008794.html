Subject: massive vacuum leak??
Message-Id: &lt;199904011647.IAA15752_at_beta.tricity.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

Greetings,

I currently have a '78 2.0L van with fuel injection that's giving me
some problems.  I've changed out the cold start injector which made
it run a lot better then I changed the head temp sensor which helped
also I've also changed out some of the vacuum hoses and the hoses
&gt;from the air distribution box to the intake manifolds.  Now, it's 
doing OK, but I still have a massive idle problem! I've also checked
the air flow meter and it's in spec according to the Bently and the
Bosch L-Jetronic section that I found out there. Oh, and the valves
are right on too and the fuel pressure is good too.

1. When I first start it, it misses and idles very low.  When I 
give it some gas, it misses but revs up to about 1100RPM then,
like a switch, it quits missing until I let it drop back under 1100
RPM.  

2. After about a minute or so, the idle smooths out but is still
low.  Then, once the engine starts to get hot, the RPM slooooowly
comes up to about 1100 RPM but bounces by 100 to 150 RPM the whole
time.

I'm thinking that I have an air leak someplace, but how do I go
about checking for it or have any other ideas on what it might be?
If I can't fix it myself, I'm going to have to have the VW dealer
look at it and I would rather not.

Thanks in advance,
Mark
