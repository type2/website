Subject: pilot bearing (was brokedown palace)

Mike (and list)-

About two months before the catastrophic failure, I noticed
noise when I pushed in the clutch while in neutral. I thought it
was the TO bearing, and was resigned to replace it during
the next engine pull. No big whup, says I. I did not get any
&quot;contact shudders&quot; like you describe.

Then, coming home one day, it went from fine to total failure
in about 1/4 mile. There was no irregular noise, just the inability
to go into ANY gear. I had to pull over to the side, and tried
forcing it into gear. No way. The clutch pedal was responsive,
so I did not think it ws the clutch cable. I shut it off, put it in first,
and started up (with the clutch pedal depressed). It acted like the
clutch was not completely disenganged - there was a slight roll
forward as the starter turned over.

Upon pulling the engine, the pilot bearing was obviously chewed
up. I removed it in about 10 seconds with a pair of needle nosed
pliers, if that is any indication. It was also bone dry. I since leaned
that the pilot bearing should be lubed with a TINY amount (1/32 oz.)
of grease whenever the engine is out.

Mangled bearing was found on both sides of the flywheel, so gland
nut and flywheel removal (on a T1 engine) is recommended. Also,
inspect very carefully the transmission input shaft. If it is scored it
should be replaced. If not, I am told it will lead quickly to pilot
bearing failure again.

&gt; Curious about your &quot;couldn't get it into any gear&quot; problem- do you mean
&gt; when it was running and you push clutch in- did it make any unusual
&gt; noises before you moved the shift lever?  Sometimes  I get strange
&gt; &quot;contact shudders&quot; when I do this, and gear 1,2 have been difficult.
&gt; With 215,000 mi on the original engine (only clutch friction disk
&gt; replaced at 150K, but I forgot to check pilot bearing then), I concerned
&gt; what this may mean.
