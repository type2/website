Subject: Re: water collecting in closet (77 westy) and converter box
Message-ID: &lt;3731EFA1.953733F6_at_aztek-eng_dot_com&gt;

I've also experienced water collecting in the upright closet of my '78 Westy.
After that first incident, I pulled the plug and have yet to put it back in.
Thus, if its still collecting, I don't know b/c its draining too.  Probably not
the best fix.  As I have my cabinet removed for the time being, I'll snoop around
this afternoon and see what there is to see.  But please post suggestions if you
have them.

&gt; I have this puddle that will collect in the upright closet (meant for hanging
&gt; clothes) in my 77 westy whenever it rains.  I can't seem to tell where it is
&gt; coming from.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Anyone have any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I was also wondering if the electrical box in the deluxe westys had a
&gt; converter built in so you could run 120V appliances without having to plug
&gt; in.  If this is true does anyone have one they want to sell??
