Subject: anyone going to boat and bus bash???

Hey everyone,
just wondering if anyone is going to the boat and bus
bash from south carolina or anywhere in between? I'm
going to be passing through OH on the way to a new job
in MI and figured I might just as well stop through an
visit with the Ohio people.

I'd love to get a carabus together bus realize that
its a long haul but figured I'd ask.

Take care,
Giles,
