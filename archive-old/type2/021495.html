Hi everybody!

Ok, I checked the valve covers, and yes Jake I had the passenger side
upside down!!  Then I noticed something else.  I had bought two sets of
valve gaskets, one cork from a wholesaler (as a backup) and another
grayish type material from the dealership.  I installed the dealer ones
the first time.  I noticed however that the gasket did not fill up the
entire channel on the cover but at the time I paid no heed to that.

This time, I had a closer look, and on a lark put in the cork ones.
They seemed to fit much better and not only filled the channel but had a
small bulge.  So I seated them and used my rubber mallet to make sure
that the covers are properly set.

Hopefully this works.  I do not think that the push rods are leaking,
but you never know.  There is still a lot of oil running down the rod
plates, on the exchangers and onto the block itself.  If the covers were
leaking, would the weeping travel that far?  Or could there be another
seal or gasket leaking somewhere else?

Thanks so much,
