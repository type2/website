Subject: Re: [T2] Camper headliner

Here's a nifty solution for the peeled vinyl.....we removed it from the
wood panel, and then covered it with fabric (Walmart, showing the busses
and bugs)- lay the fabric on a flat surface and stretch it evenly withy
weights around the edges. Spray glue the removed panel.  Drop it on the
fabric and walk all over it.  Let dry.  Cut around the edges about 1&quot;
overlap.  Fold over the edges and sprayglue.
