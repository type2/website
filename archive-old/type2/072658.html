        Ok, just had to add my few cents about this issue.  I'm a young
busser/v-duber (almost 22) I bought my first VW a '69 beetle in '95 when I
was 18.  I paid $1900 for it (all my own cash).  I just redid it last
summer putting over $3000 into it.  I still own that wonderful summer daily
driver!  Last winter I bought a bus from a friend of mine for $400.  It
didn't &amp; still doesn't run.  I've already put thousands into it (oh how
people like my friends &amp; parents think I'm crazy--and so do I at times) and
am doing a restoration on it at present.  It's taking forever-- I have
almost all of the windows out.  Some doors off &amp; completely all of the
inside out.  But in the end I will have one of the best vehicles on the
road (in my opinion.)  I love driving &amp; working on VW's.  They're a great
vehicle &amp; you always get smiles out of people when you drive them ( except
for those big cadillac drivers who shake there head when they pass you-- it
happened to me today, or that iron ore miner who is still stuck in war
times &amp; doesn't like the little beetle or bus-- Had one of them try to
drive me off the road! )  Ok so I got a little off the subject, but just
wanted to say I love my Volkswagens &amp; treat them the best I can...
