&gt; Woo Hoo!
&gt; ... The inserts that I am referring to are those that are on top of the
dash board.
&gt; If you could throw me a quote on what a pair of these will cost, I may
purchase two pair.

Pulled one off of G a minute ago and mine seem to be in good shape.  I'm
assuming that it's the same part (#211 255 482 B) for both sides, correct?
Mine are black...

I'll work up the figures later and post them here.

&gt; I am also in the market for late bay style rear hatch hinge covers...

There's a rub on this one.  Another company is selling repros that are
injection molded, and I probably can't come close to their pricing.

What I've been looking at is modifying the covers to include something like
openings for lights/speakers/defroster fans/etc..  I pulled the sun-damaged
ones off of G long ago, but they're just hanging up in the shop while I try
to think of a legitimate reason to invest time and materials into repro'ing
them.

As far as colors go, I can create just about any color, whether I'm using
opaque or the clear resin (no non-DOT approved lenses, sorry).  For example,
I just cast a deep purple sliding door handle for the president of our local
VW club.  I finally got the key fob into production.  Tried painting one,
but pocket wear tends to take the paint off.  So I'm going to cast these in
color, too (pics, one of these days).

It's usually more of a question of investment than it is of whether or not I
can actually repro something.  We're building the company on a mold and a
prayer, so sometimes the delay between initiating a project and getting
paying customers for it slows things down.
