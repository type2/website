Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning engine case

Ask Stan Wider about the dishwasher miracle--he uses this high tech

E-mail message


Beginning process of engine rebuild. Other than taking the case halves
to a shop to tank. Anyone had any success cleaning parts in a
dishwasher? Does it work as well or just a waste of time and a source
for disharmony in the household.


take em to a shop, unless of course you really do need to get a new
dishwasher (to appease household administration)
