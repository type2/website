Subject: when did dual carbs start?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0010111437290.13-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;


Hi everyone...
Im hoping somebody can help me. I got an engine, what i think is an early
70's 1600 but im not 100% sure. This is my 4th VW engine and Ive only
worked on 1800cc's and up (i am a FI guy;) )  This new engine has dual
solex carbs, I was wondering what year VW started putting dual carbs in
busses. Whatever they are, they are both mangled and will need to be
replaced. What options do I have to replace them? They are Labled PDSIT-2
and PDSIT-3. Thanks for any help you can give
