Hey Steve

Thanks for the advice,, but permatex makes lots of stuff,, for different
applications.
Which gooo are you refering to?

I used to LOVE Permatex OE type form-a-gasket 471... but it is NLA,,
and the closest they have is Permatex Aviation Form-a-gasket 3D

I use that for most all gaskets, except the cyl base gaskets, I use RTV
silicone,, &lt;shame on me!&gt;
I am careful to ensure NO globs can develop.. just a thin wipe of RTV is
good... globs are bad!
Also, Rtv , or 3M weatherstrip glue for the rocker to cover side of the
rockercover gasket, and the Permatex 3D on the head side that way it
sticks to the cover, and not the head.

I have been happy , as no leaks means a well sealed engine!
