&gt; This is my first real winter in my bus. We recieved a good 8 inches

&gt; steering alot of the time, even though i kept it pretty slow. I have two 
&gt; 80lb. sandbags out in my barn and I was wondering if using them up front in 
&gt; the bus would help much? I would probably put them in between the front 
&gt; seats. Has anyone else ever done this? Any thoughts would be appriciated.

the thing that makes a bug a great car in the snow is that it has about
70% of its weight over its driving wheels.  Buses don't have this rearward
weight bias, so you'd be better off putting the bags in the back.

Personally, I've never used ballast in my  bus in the winter and I've had
no problems.  I was stuck in glare ice on the 14 freeway in Palmdale
behind a 944 Porsche.  It had so little weight on the drive wheels that it
couldn't get started.  I gave him a little nudge (thank goodness for
bumper guards!) to get him going each time traffic crawled ahead.  I must
have repeated this 10 times!
