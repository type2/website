Subject: Re: Bus needs tunes

On my 74 westy I had radio shack minimus 7 speakers mounted under the
dash, and powered Sub-bass tube in a custom console I built between the
front seats. I placed two 3 way six by nines under the bed and lost only
about two inches in depth. You could also cut a spacer out of MDF to
bring the speaker face out farther if room in the storage box is an
issue. Power and tunes were supplied by an old high powered Fujitsu
am/fm cast. deck with about 45 watts a side. to prevent the deck from
bouncing you have to use that rear stap and connect that to any bolt
nearby. No problem with sound as the van is a nice little sound box,
unfortunately engine noise for those of you who want to keep checking
out your engine that way is absolutely non-existent.
	In my 81 westy I have a blaupunkt am/fm cd deck that slipped in with
only smoothing out the edges of the opening. I have relocated the
Minimus speakers so they are right below where I and the significant
other sit (by the feet.) These are held in place by a single screw that
is drilled into the space beneath the seats and the speakers are angled
upward so we can hear the sound. Next on the list is to add an amplifier
that will sit behing the glove box and either 6x9's in the back staorage
or surface mounts on the back package shelf The sub might find a home in
the closet or I will find some six inch subs and build some boxes in the
back. 
	I would reccommend the Minimus speakers if you do not want to cut the
cabinets. You will still have to drill screw holes and use brackets but
the sound from these speakers are well worth it.
