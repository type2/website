Subject: [T2] Stuart and Kit Habel still online??

     Sam and I stayed with 'em in Denver on the way home from Inuvik 
&lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/trip/82196.html&gt;. I seem to have lost their email 
address though... Anybody have any contact info? If somebody could 
forward this to the Vanagon list they might be over there-I'm assuming I 
can't post it since I'm not subbed over there...


Peace,
