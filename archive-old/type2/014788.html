This is what I did when installing my Kadron on my 71. I used a brake
booster line off a 72-74 Bus and adapted it to fit my 71 Carbs. It works
great, it also acts as the balance tube. Kadrons all use a balance tube,
mine does double duty.

 if you do that, you are effectively connecting them together which may or
 may not affect how the engine runs. &gt;&gt;

This is what VW did on the 72 - 75 buses.  They used a metal pipe and 
definitely avoided tube collapse!
