Subject: clutch problem
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ugh:

On my 1980 Vanagon L Westfalia, something's amiss with the clutch.  There's
been a chattering grinding rubbing metalic noise coming from my tranny.
Here are the symptoms:

- When not moving, sometimes I'll get The Noise, but it goes away when I
shift into gear.  Sometimes I can't get right into first gear, and I'll
have to go into third gear to loosen things up, then I can easily get into
first.

- When moving, the noise is only present when I'm in gear.  It changes with
engine speed.  It does not go away with the clutch depressed.  It stops
instantly when I go into neutral, including when, say, shifting between 1st
and 2nd (it will stop during the brief period in neutral between the two
gears).  The Noise is present in all gears.

- The Noise is the same noise I get if I'm in neutral and I push the stick
into gear without depressing the clutch.  Chattering metalic rubbing
grinding, not really nasty, but relentless.

Some background:

- Tranny rebuilt 5000 miles ago.

- There is a droplet of tranny oil on the tranny, and I havn't checked the
oil level since the rebuild

- I had a clutch problem for about the last 30 city miles, where it was
hard to get into gear, and from time to time there'd be a grind or a klunk,
but I think I fixed this when I put brake fluid in.  (My '80 vanagon has a
hydraulic clutch).

That's it.  Any hints would be beyond appreciated.  Thanks hugely.
