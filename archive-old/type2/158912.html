Subject: SVDA and Kadrons

I just got an SVDA distributor and ported throttle plate for my Kadrons 
and without directions being included or available at aircooled_dot_net I'm 
having some problems. The first thing is with the SVDA. When I installed 
it number one was pointing in a different direction than the 009 was so 
I rotated the plug wires around to match. Then after I installed the new 
base on the left carb I discovered that it was next to impossible to 
attach the vacuum hose. I found one reference in the T2 archives from 
someone who had installed theirs on the right carb. When I started it 
the engine didn't want to idle and after a lot of fiddling it wants to 
race for a couple seconds and then die way down before repeating the 
same symptom. What have I done wrong?

Since I'm on digest I'd appreciate any answers to both me and the list.

Larry
