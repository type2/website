&gt;&gt;57
&gt;&lt;grin&gt; I think we have a winner. Can anybody top that?

If you are talking about age of just list members, no, but if you are
talking about age of bus enthusiasts, yes I can beat that...My
grandfather, age 84, has a '78 Westphalia he takes camping, and a '95
Eurovan, which he drives everyday.   

By the way, I was wondering, what is the proper way to spell Westphalia,
I have seen it written both ways, with a &quot;ph&quot; and with a
&quot;f&quot;...  Dallas
