Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

&gt;It's called 'branding'...And it's the same all across the manufacturing
&gt;spectrum. Take a known and respected 'brand name' and slap it on
&gt;almost anything. Kohler plumbing products (high end stuff usually,
&gt;and well-made) now slap it on the inferior products that the mega-
&gt;home stores sell. Klein Tools (electrican's specialty tools), same
&gt;story...It goes on...The worst part is the gradual deterioration of
&gt;the original product's 'good name' or the realization that the
&gt;name has more value than the product. Harley-Davidson, for ex-
&gt;ample, makes more money from H-D products than selling H-D's.

AC Delco was doing that with auto parts at Advance Auto...

Junky starters and alternators that AC Delco never touched.
