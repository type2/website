Try a turkey baster!  Me, I suck up the oil in a long 1/4&quot; width pvc
tube so I can see where it is and stick my tongue over the upper end.
Place the free end into the spark plug hole and blow it in. This is
easier if done through the upper engine hatch.  RE plug removal for
compression test, warm it up enough to get the oil sloshing over the
cylinders, then remove the plugs.  I see no reason plugs can't be taken
from a hot engine, just harder on the fingers to touch the plug!
