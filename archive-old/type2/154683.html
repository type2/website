Subject: Oil Pressure dropping to Zero after 15 mnutes warm up when I
  stop? 

-1600 DP Stock Engine ...16,000 miles on building it.

-VDO Oil Pressure gauge and sensor.....

When I start the engine , oil pressure is fine but after running for 15 or so
minutes when oil temps get up to 200-205 ( oil pressure ok at  40-45 psi )
but when I come up to a light or stop sign the oil pressure drops to 0. Oil
light comes on and stays on until the rpm's raise above idle (900 rpm) when I
drive off. ????

Then I go on my way and everything seems fine until I stop and the oil lights
comes on again.

When I first get in the bus the engine is warming up (120 to 180 degess) the
first 15 minutes or so  when I come to a stop sign at idle the oil pressure is
10-20 psi.... seems fine. Frustrating,,,,,,

I replaced the oil pressure relieve and pressure springs and the plugs which
increased my oil pressure but after 15 minutes (Oil temps 200-210) the
pressure drops to 0.

Any ideas?

Running Castrol HD 40 wt. It's hot here in Houston but never had the oil
pressure ever drop to 0 before like this. Engine was built 2 years ago. No
visible oil leaks anywhere.

Help....

Trey
