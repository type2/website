&gt;Just did the first oil-change/tune-up on my new avp rebuld (100 miles). They
&gt;said I could use normal oil, so I used Castrol 20w50. I did notice
&gt;(afterwards) that there was a post in the archives about Castrol being bad
&gt;for break-in...that doesn't make much sense to me, but if anyone has any
&gt;comments I'd like to know.

If you talk to Jerry at NW ConRod, he will tell you of several motor 
failures wherein the only common link was Castrol for break in. He replaced 
a half a dozen engines before he figured it out. The cam lobes just went 
away. No such failures were noted with any other brands. These were new VW 
cams and lifters. Castrol must have changed something in their mix a few 
years ago because surely before these failures all within a few months it 
was being used by some for break-in without problems for many years.


&gt;Oil had a few fine metallic hairs, and a very few fine brass(?) flakes. I
&gt;guess that's about par.

typical


&gt;All the valves were .001&quot; or .002&quot; tighter than when I started. Is that
&gt;normal? They were at .006&quot; initially.

typical, I set valves at .008 for initial break-in for this reason.


&gt;I also couldn't get the RPM below about 1100-1200.  This has been a
&gt;perpetual problem for my bus; prior to the rebuild too. Would this
&gt;invalidate my timing or cause other problems?

You can't time it dynamically at idle unless the idle is spec. Otherwise, 
the advance can be in play.

&gt;  It's weird; sometimes the
&gt;rpm's get down to the 900's when the engine is really warm, but not always.

A worn throttle shaft can do this, or any vacuum leak. A cracked s-hose 
should be ruled out as well.
