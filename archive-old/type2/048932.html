Hi Wouter,

    Have you seen the movie Medicine Man, staring Sean Connery? At any rate
at the begining of that movie there is a bus like you describe. It caught my
attention also, and by single frame advancing my VCR you can tell it is a
radiator. So it must be water cooled.
    Along those lines I have heard of a Brazilian water cooled bus that
use'es the inline four cylinder engine (Rabbit, Golf, Jetta, etc). I would
like to find one of those in the US. Could it be this bus?
    BTW, I have a 82 camper that started life as a Diesel, that I converted
to inline gas. I used CIS fuel system off an older Rabbit. It was a natural
switch, runs great, very smooth, and very good fuel mileage.

See Ya,

Tommy
