Subject: Re: :) Turning air cooled into water cooled

&gt;The New York Museum of Natural History is going to take a
&gt;VW bug and drop it into the murky waters of Lake Erie. They are
&gt;doing a project on Zebra Mussels (sp?), and will take the
&gt;zebra-coated bug out in November, shellac it, and put it on display
&gt;in an endangered species exhibit.

&gt;Of course, the irony of the air cooled engine was lost..

I expect that the irony of intentionally killing a bunch of Zebra Mussels
in order to make the point that they are endangered was lost as well.
Science as performance art. This kind of stuff makes me scratch my head. ;)
