Subject: Re: [T2] What's a &quot;Pure&quot; bus?

I can agree completely with Bob,

I snowboard 2 to 3 days a week up here in the Canadian rockies during 
the winter, in temps that sometimes drop as low as -30. With my bilge 
blower and my Eberspracher I have yet to have any discomfort. Sleeping 
in Lake Louise at those temps can be chilly but if you have a power 
outlet a nice space heater can turn it right tropical.
My 73 is my daily driver and she got me through the winter without a 
hitch. I have a &quot;block heater&quot; that is bolted on the bottom of the oil 
screen plate and I wasn't prevented from starting at all, well other 
than when my bus was a brick of ice and I couldn't open the doors. The 
block heater is just a heating element really, the only annoying this 
about it is the power cable melted where it contacted my exhaust at 
some point ... luckily I found that out the other day while doing  an 
oil change so I can fix it pre-winter, its only two bolts and its off.

&gt; VW stock heat is adequate for that, I ski in the &quot;COLD&quot; mountains up 
&gt; North
&gt; and get up for first tracks, long before dawn with the temps below 0, 
&gt; that
&gt; is what I think of as cold, and that is where that Eberspracher pays 
&gt; for
&gt; itself....one option I have is a block heater and plug in the bus at 
&gt; night
&gt; for easier starts....
