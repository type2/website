&gt;I couldn't convince the archives to spit out a phone # for Universal..
&gt;Anyone happen to have a contact #?

&gt;Also, I read that you have to assemble little adapter circuit for the
&gt;wire going to the FI ECU.
&gt;What is involved here? Can an averagejoe do it?

The Tiger 581 comes with a sheet describing it. I believe it is 3
components: a 6800 ohm resistor, a .05 microfarad capacitor, and a diode.
The sheet may only talk about using this circuit for input to a tach, but it
should help with the signal for FI purposes as well. I just put a Tiger 581
on my bus with a Weber and it works fine. I didn't have to use this circuit,
but a friend built this circuit to clean up his bouncing tach and it seemed
to work. The circuit is about as simple as a circuit gets - you do have to
know that the white bar on a diode is the same end as the bar on the diode
symbol : ---&gt;|--- .     Parts are available at Radio Schack.

&gt;two units. It seems that the Compufire and maybe the Pertronix?
&gt;both require you to cut/saw ~3mm off the bottom of your rotor.
&gt;is this the correct or did i misread those posts?

&gt;From my experience, the pertronix fits right in without any modifications.
