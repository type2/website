Subject: Re: 77 trans

Know that if you do this, there will be several negatives:

1) Your transaxle will be 1/2&quot; shorter than before (your gearshift knob
will wind up closer to the dash than before).
2) Your motor will be spinning much faster on the freeway - top speed will
likely be reduced.
3) You are getting a bushing instead of a bearing in the front of the trans
(where the shift rod comes out).  It will wear and leak faster (ask me how
I know).
4) You are getting a trans that is weaker than your old one in general.

On the other hand, you will be able to drive up a 35% grade.  Maybe you
like that kind of thing?  If not, I recommend that you pony up the extra $$
and get the 091 tranny.

&gt;&gt; Will a transmission for a 72-74 bus fit and work ok in
&gt;&gt; our 77 westy? What problems might occur with this
&gt;&gt; change? Our Westy needs a new trans but the cost of
&gt;&gt; the later model transmissions is a little out of our
&gt;&gt; budget right now. Thank you in advance for your
&gt;&gt; answers.
