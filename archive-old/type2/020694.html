Subject: mexican engines

Is it possible to buy complete turn key new mexican 1600 engines with
the FI and all?  if so where, i know new longblocks are readily
available but what about turnkeys?  seems like someone would sell them,
maybe it'd be worth a trip across the border to buy one from a vw
dealer?
thanks
jamie
