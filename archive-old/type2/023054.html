Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carbed 2.0 litre

Actually it did come stock with dual carbs for many years outside of the 
U.S., and type2 is an international mailing list.  I asked this same 
question on the list a few years ago and got no definitive answer, but I 
ran 132.5 mains and 155 air corrections on my 2-liter with the stock Solex 
carbs for a few years and performance and gas mileage were acceptable.  Ran 
out of breath on the top end, but acceptable.

&gt;No such animal. The 2.0 never came with carbs stock. They can be set up
&gt;very well with a pair of Weber 40 IDF's, in which case consult your
&gt;supplier about jet sizes for your configuration.
