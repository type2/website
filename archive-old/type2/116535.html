Subject: Part number match/ compatabilty

Jasan,

&gt;Did you get a valve matching the same part number as &gt;what you removed?

Karl and I went to the junkyard to check out a bus. All I know is that is was an f.i. type4 engine, so it was 75-79. Probably 75-78 because the 79 engine is funky (I have one) and I would've noticed the luck of having that 79 engine there in my town, which I didn't.

After Karl got my busing running in 10 minutes after I worked for 3 weeks, he noticed my deceleration was irregular as we rev'ed the engine. Bus-Saint that he is, he went back to the yard, plucked the valve and shoved it in there, immediately curing the problem.

&gt;What year bus do you have? 

76 w/ 79 cal spec engine

&gt;Did you have the high warm idle problem like I have?

No. see above.

Billy
76 hardtop camper (79 cal motor)
79 deluxe sunroof (project)
70 deluxe across town for 1000 (eyeballing)
