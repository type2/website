Done a little casual research I can share. The best transmision seems to be
the late 091 4-speed as is offers the highest geared differential, a 4.57
in combination with a .85 4th gear. There is a .78 4th gear out there if
you can find one, but $$.

There are several 5-speed Vanagon transmissions that you might be able to
fit into a 74, but they are very hard to find, and the most common, the
5-speed from a diesel, has a  5.43 diff and a .82 5th so you would have
more revs. I'm not sure how common Turbo-diesel vanagons are in new
Zealand, they had a more reasonable ratio of  4.83 diff and a .82 5th, but
still more revs.

There was a guy on the list who was sticking the gear set from a 911 into a
914 case to put into a bay. And then there's this post telling how to put a
911 5-speed into a van.

The advantage of using a sports car tranny is they are also geared pretty
low for acceleration so you wouldn't have the problem of low RPMs at
highway speeds causing overheating. The post specifies 85MPH at 4500RPM.

Gene Berg also makes a conversion kit to add a 5th gear onto an 091, but it
extends the length of the transmission by (I think) approx 2.5&quot;. Really
designed for sand rail use where it's easy to customize the chassis. He
uses a Rabbit 5th gear, don't know what ratios are available.

I decided to stick with the stock tranny for my 78 after my research.
