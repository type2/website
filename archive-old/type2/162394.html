&gt; i have a 1978 vw transporter.  i know that it is fuel injected.  i need to
&gt; know what type of fuel injection system that i likely have in this bus.

it is an Air Flow Controlled system (AFC) there is a van in the air intake
that measures the air flow and sends messages to the injection system
