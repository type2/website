Subject: Re: Help!  I can't get my 71 Westy to idle!

OK, I don't mind appearing stupid if I end up learning something.  BUT, I've
been unscrewing and blowing clean the air bypass on and off for 3 years, and
always screwing it snug back in.  After that, idle is perfect.  How could
that be?  Is idle air being sucked in some other way?  The bus exhibits no
other engine problem, other than the acceleration that seems to be 75 years
behind the times around here (too bad for them).

&gt;&gt;Just an idea:  unscrew the idle jet (it's midway down the carb throat on
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;right hand side, has a nice big brass head on it pointing directly to the
&gt;&gt;right (toward the air cleaner),
&gt;
&gt;This is an Idle air bypass screw, it allows air to pass for Idle, if its
&gt;clogged, no air will pass.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Unscrew it, hand onto it as it leaves the carb casting,
&gt;&gt;take it out and vigorously blow it clean.  Once it looks spotless, put it
&gt;&gt;back in nice and snug.
&gt;
&gt;Don't put it in snug! That will close off the passage completely, it needs
&gt;to be backed out a turn or two. These were set at the factory and  is said
&gt;to never need adjustment, but on a 20-30 year old car these have been
played
&gt;with 100 times. There is lots of info on these carbs in the library. Look
it
&gt;up and fix it right. Get the Bentley out, may be time for a carb rebuild.
&gt;
&gt;You need to check for vacuum leaks. Some people like to use WD-40 for this.
&gt;Other tings work, just watch out what you use as it will be flamable. Spray
&gt;it around all intake track brakes(carb base, intake boots, gaskets, hoses,
&gt;carb body) If the RPMs rise, you found the leak. Check the carb to see if
&gt;its tight, they like to work loose. If the carb dirty and been a long time
&gt;from last rebuild it may be time. Could have dirt in the Idle jet or idle
&gt;passages.
&gt; Good Luck
