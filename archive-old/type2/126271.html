Subject: Re: [T2] Where's the high beam switch?

You have to have the lights, and ignition, on to hear the click.

&lt;&lt; On my '72 you pull the turn signal level up towards you to switch to high 
beam.
 
 It feels real flimsley but I do hear a relay click and the blue high 
 beam indicator lights up on the dash.
 Pull the lever again to go back to normal beams (and blue light off).
 
 Perhaps someone changed your turn signal switch and/or the high beam 
 relay is hosed?
