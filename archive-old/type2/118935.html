Subject: '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

Hey Folks,
    I have a chance to buy a '72 bus (Westfalia) for a fairly decent price.
Advice from respected bus friends though say to stay away from the '72 model
year, lot of one year only parts that are difficult to find. The dual carbs
have been replaced with a single Weber ( I used to own a '75 bus with the FI
removed and a single Weber, so I know what I'm getting into there). Opinions
please from owners/former owners of '72's-buy it or run? I don't need advice
on buses in general, I've owned plenty! Just info on '72's.  Thanks,  Jeff
Stewart
