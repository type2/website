Subject: NEW AS 41 case special

  Here we go, I have a great pre &quot;I'm going to Jerome special&quot;. One of my
importers just called and made me an offer I can't refuse, so I took him up
on it and am passing the savings on to all my BUS LIST buddies.  
  BRAND NEW AS 41 Brazil/Brazil universal cases. These are great cases ansd
all I now use in building new engines. 
These have the bolt boses in the front for the buses and have the type 3 oil
filler hole also. They have case savers and use 8 mm studs. They do not have
the oil pump studs, mounting studs, fuel pump studs etc with them, these
come in an extra kit with oil relief plugers and all for extra cost.
 NOW the DEAL  250.00 dollars, you see it right 250 dollars. These are the
exact same cases you see in ads for up to 350 dollars.
 NOW the kicker. This deal is only good till 2 pm tomorrow (I am leaving at
3 pm to Jerome) All cases sold will ship on Tuesday or Wednesday after my
return, shipping IS NOT included. If you want to see what shipping cost
check UPS from  ZIP code 86403 at 35 lbs weight.

NOW these will only be sold through PHONE ORDERS ONLY so call me before 5 pm
Cali time or between 8 to 2 tomorrow. 
If you call an leave a message, someone from here will call you tomorrow to
get your CC and shipping info.

Remember this is for 24 hours only when I get back the price will go back up
to 295.99 a 45.99 dollar savings

thanks  ronnie  old volks of az
