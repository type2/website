Hello everyone im new to the list and have a rather amateurish simple
quesiton, i recently acquired a 77 with stock 2.0 FI engine, i have been
told and seem to remember that the early FI's sucked.  I know i have heard
this.  THis being the case, what was the problems they had, and what
should i look for on a engine that has been sitting for about 2yrs?

thanks for  any input
