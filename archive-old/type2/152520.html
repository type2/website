Subject: Re: [T2] Junkyard save

James,
You did the right thing by saving this bus. In my opinion you'd do the
right thing by giving it a type 1 engine and tranny (why not stock).
The type 4 sounds like a lot of work to install in there and a type4
in a 71 is not good for overall resale value of the bus.

People like 71s because of type 1 engine + disc brakes. This is a 1
year only combo.

If buyers want a type 4 they can buy anything from 72-9.

You are looking at ~1500$ for a brand new type 1 VW engine. You have
already tin and all since it came with the bus.

As far as you are concerned, if you want a bus with a type 4 engine,
buy a 72-79 and get rid of the 71, you'll be bussing earlier and for
less money.

my humble 0.02

- Arnaud
