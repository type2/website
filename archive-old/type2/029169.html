I think that CO detectors have been discussed before on the list but this
article has great info on battery operated ones (and CO detectors in
general) and a long list of people dead from CO poisoning in a moving air
cooled vehicle. This was actually posted to my electric tractor list
(charging the batteries was setting off a CO detector) and is aimed at
pilots but when I read the article I immediatly thought of the bus
application. Especially pertinent is the discussion of response time

&quot;While this difference in response rate is probably no big deal with
respect to the in-home application for which both of these CO detectors
were designed, it seems to me that it IS important when it comes to
aviation use. Here's why I think so. If your home CO detector alarms, your
course of action is clear: get grandma and the kids out of the house, call
911, open some doors and windows, and get out yourself. Right? On the other
hand, if your detector alerts you to a CO hazard while in flight, you
really don't have the option of stepping outside...at least not right away.
&quot;


This is true for us VW Bus &quot;pilots&quot; also. Having your judgement impaired by
CO while driving, and THEN the detector goes off seems like asking for
trouble. The one they reccomend is more sensitive then commonly available
CO detectors.

CAVEAT: The site hosting the article is selling these detectors. The
reviewer seems to be an impartial 3rd party at another website, which I did
go visit, and the original reaches the same conclusion. I am not a pilot
nor do I play one on my computer (never got the hang of those flight sims).
I am open to other reccomendations!!!
