Subject: Re: [T2] Best spark plugs?
Content-Disposition: inline

Thanks for all your responses - it seems that Bosch has the vote! 

Please forgive my ignorance but are their differnet types of spark plugs out there i.e. different lengths/threads etc. that I have to avoid? As I explained earlier, being new to vehicle mechanics I am probably asking dumb questions - but I suppose it is the only way to learn! 

I have bought Muir's book that has been recommended by everyone but I am sure that I have heard, somewhere, that plugs can come in different lengths etc. - so I am bit confused.

If anyone could point me in the direction of an online resource I would be grateful
