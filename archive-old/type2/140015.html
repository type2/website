&lt;&lt; Did they have any milage figures for that? I doubt a 1000 HP 13.6L V 16

Ever see, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;... ?-) This little buggy comes com-
plete with a trailer-mounted gas tank... ;-)

The promo on the car from another source claims that the V16 has
a computerized 16-8-4 cylinder variability that gives the car 20 MPG
on the highway...Altho' if anyone on the list remembers the 8-6-4
Caddies of around 1980... don't bet on reliability or mileage... ;-(
