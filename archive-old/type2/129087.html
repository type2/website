Subject: re  Why drive a VW bus?

&gt;Second reason, is that I live in a small, but very politically town.  It has 
very outspoken liberals, including their buses.  So, I put several stickers on 
my bus, but not the type you think.  One sticker reads...&quot;SHUT UP HIIPPY&quot;  
another says &quot;BAD HIPPIE, NO BONG HIT&quot;.  The third is a decal with a bunch of 
burnt trees, and the slogan &quot;HUG THIS HIPPIE&quot;.  Did I mention that it is 
camoflauged and has off road tires?  Yep, that's right.  It's an ANTI-HIPPIE bus.  
Its a blast to drive and lots of people smile.  Especially when I drive it to 
&gt;work in my police uniform.

And this is not taking life too seriously???????????????  Get a grip!  You need to have another reason for driving your bus, besides thumbing your nose at a class of people that you don't have a clue about!
