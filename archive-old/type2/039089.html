Subject: distributor application
Content-Language: en

  I came across a distributor I bought years ago but never used; originally for my '72 Bus.  The guy I bought it from said it was an &quot;050&quot; distributor and I didn't know enough at the time to verify.  The distributor is mechanical advance unit and has the Bosch numbers 231 129 031.  I see on Ron Salmon's site that he sells it (for considerably more than I paid for it!), but I see no application either there or in the Type II archives.

  Any idea of applications?
