Jamie (and anyone else who wants to know),

I looked up the part # of the boots I bought from the dealer and it turns
out they are the same part, but a newer revision.  The last letter is F, not
C.  I must have been thinking of another part that was off a different car.
This is the sort of thing that Jim at the old volks home would stock, if he
were at home.  Is the business still being run in his absence?  Have you
tried the bus depot?

&gt; I am trying to find a rubber boot that attaches below the carb, on the
&gt; intake manifold to a small steel line.
&gt; It is on the left and right carb of a '74  1800cc
&gt; The number on it is   021-129-637-C
