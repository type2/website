Well The time has come for me to put a new 1600 dp in my 71 westy and I 
was wondering if anyone ahd suggestions for a quality company to order 
from.  Because of the price factor I have decided to buy a rebuilt 
longblock as opposed to a new one.   Some of the companies I am 
considering are;  Strictly Foregin, Moffoco, Barrett enterprises, GEX, 
Quality German Auto Parts, Rogers European Engineering, eliete Foregin 
Auto, and Chirco.   Does anyone have ANY experience with any of these, 
good or bad.  I am planning on ordering in the next week so let me know.

Thanks In advance,
Kevin Fox,
71 Westy  (The Mighty Quin)
