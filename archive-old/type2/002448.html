Bear in mind that the panel in question functions as the firewall in a VW
bus.

Any repair/modification/etc. needs to be _highly_ heat resistant.

As others on this List will attest, even with everything tight and
undisturbed back there an engine compartment and/or fuel system fire spreads
to the bus interior with breathtaking speed.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  So now I've discovered that someone cut this hole in my bus so as to
replace the fuel tank sending unit without pulling the engine and gas tank.
