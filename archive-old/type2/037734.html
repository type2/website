Subject: GL4, Redline?

Hi Bussers,
I have a question regarding GL4 tranny oil and compatibility with with 
Redline synthetic oil.  A couple of years ago a mechanic did nose cone work 
on my 70 Westy transmission and changed the gear oil.  He used Redline 
synthetic and said it was great stuff.  Now I wonder if it is ok for my 
tranny.  Does anyone know if this oil is compatible with GL4?  I'm assuming 
it's a 90 weight.  I can't located a parts store that carries it to check.  
The shop that did the work is not around any more.  Thanks for any feedback.

Thanks,
Tom Riis
