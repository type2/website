Subject: Re: Exhaust and Vacuum Leaks

 &gt;Now I didn't check the
points as I installed a new vacuum advance distributor.  So I expect the
points gap is ok.

Don't assume anything! ;)

 &gt;When I attempt to start the bus I must crank the starter
several seconds with ALOT of gas before the engine will start.  When it
finally does start the engine SLOWLY comes to life and will idle ok.  When I
give it gas the system appears to hesitate and wants to backfire.  Eventually
the condition improves with gradual applied pressure to the gas the engine
will accelerate somewhat normal.

This COULD be caused by the weber progressive. When the intake 
runners are cold the fuel can condense making the engine run lean. 
Opening the throttle then lets more air in without the requisite 
amount of fuel causing that hesitation you noticed. If this IS the 
problem it will go away in a few minutes of idling/driving (very 
dependent on the air temp) as the intake runners warm up. I have 
attached an air cleaner from a Mazda to my weber progressive (as I 
described in a recent post) to at least partly address this problem.

 &gt;Where do I start to make certain the vacuum
system is operating correctly? I connected the vacuum advance from the
distributor to a second connection/port where the braking vacuum boost
connects to the weber progressive carburetor.  There are two additional ports
on the weber progressive carburetor.  Maybe these need to be plugged?  What do
you think?

I don't understand this explanation. The brake vacuum doesn't connect 
to the carb. It connects to the plenum that the carb is mounted on 
(this is probably what you meant and I'm being obtuse!). On my weber 
progressive the vacuum advance port is above the idle mixture screw. 
I have no additional ports. Can you describe where they are (or 
better still, link to a photo)?

Martin.
