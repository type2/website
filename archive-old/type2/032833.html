Subject: Does your bus look like this?

I'm trying to gather ideas for the repaint of my '71 westy this 
coming spring. I know i want it two toned. i was originally thinking 
of green on the bottom, white on top.

but then i stumbled across this:

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/colors/31h_90d.gif

and i think i really like it. but i've never seen a bus with this 
color scheme. so, i'm looking for some pictures of one. the red is 
chianti red, but i'm not sure what the off-white top half is [or if 
that's just a bad scan]. if your bus is this color combo, and you 
have an electronic picture of it i could take a look at, let me know. 
or, if you know of any place on the web where i might find a picture, 
point me to it! [i've checked out the VW Planet site, but i could 
only find fuzzy pictures of red/white loafs, but i'm not sure if 
they're chianti red]

thanks,
-perry
