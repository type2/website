Maybe the front with a really small motorcycle, but definitely not the rear.
Neither of the bumper mounting brackets are strong enough to hold any
motorcycle, so they would have to be substantially improved.  It would take
some welding to do it.  I would take a bicycle if I was you, cuz there are a
bazillion ways to carry a bike on a bus...  My '69 Riviera is getting a tow
hitch put on today so that I can tow a trailer with my motorcycle on it.
Good luck
Russell


&gt; As most of you know, I am planning on travelling cross country in my 70
&gt; Westy. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to mount a motocycle to the
&gt; front or rear of my bus. I appreciate any and all replies :)
&gt; thank you
