I wouldn't worry about overcarburetion... Gene Berg sells Dual Kadron
40s, which work with &quot;engines from 1300cc through 2300cc&quot;. The bear is
in getting the proper jetting figured out for your motor so that it will
run properly. It may take some tinkering/visits to someone with an
exhaust gas analyzer... But if it is improperly adjusted/jetted, it may
lead you to believe that it is overcarbed. BTDT... ask me how i know.
	I believe that the dual-port Kadron sets that come from Gene Berg are
all jetted for stock 1600cc motors. (that is, 130 main jets, 55 idle
jets, 28mm venturis)... to start. 
	Berg also has some *special* instructions concerning timing a 009
distributor when used with dual Kadrons... though I confess I didn't buy
my Kadrons or my 009 from them. Sold the Kadrons with a '71 Bus.
	They do have some sets for single port applications, which grabs *my*
attention... might end up with that 009/Kadron rosetta stone-info-
hookup anyways ;)

Heartily Yours....

&gt; whoa.  You dont mention whether this is a stock engine or not....With dual
&gt; 40's, i'd seriously hope you are not still running a 1600cc engine!
&gt; 
&gt; If you ARE, you are tremendously overcarborated.  You need to get smaller
&gt; venturi's, and rejet.  If you're running a bigger engine, then I dont
&gt; know.;)
&gt; 
&gt; good luck...david
