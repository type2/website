Subject: Window locks for 77 Van

Hi All

I have a 77 Kombi (Australian Model) which has the sliding type side
windows as seen in the later Vanagon models.

My problem is that the two sliding type latches for the windows have
been broken by the PO or someone and I cant lock the windows.

Over here every time I go to my VWFLAPS they say that I cant get those
locks and that my modle should have had the hinged quarter windows as
earlier models had. 

I was wondering if anyone has a VW part number for these things or if
they are available in the US.  If any one can help please email me
with your suggestions or if you have any to sell, I need two one for
each side.

Thanks 

Darryn
