Subject: Sunroof parts?

Since the topic of sunroofs came up, I have a question.

I am looking for replacement track covers for my 1969 Sunroof bus.

The plastic pieces that cover the cable and track have broken.  This
causes the cable to slip when I try to close the roof.

Anyone know how to repair this?  Can I buy the covers anymore?


Thanks
