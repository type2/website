Subject: Grinding New Valves

Simple Question:
Let's say you order a new valve from Rocky Mtn. Whn you get the valve, do
you have to get a machinist to cut the new valve to fit the valve seat? I
seem to remember something in my Bentley about cutting the head of the
valve to three different angles.

BTW, this is on a 1700 CC Type IV.

Thanks,
John Tracy
