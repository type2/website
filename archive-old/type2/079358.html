Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment?

Karl:
 There is nothing in the speedo head for the LAYMAN to adjust. Speedo shops use a
magnetiser-demagnetiser to adjust the magnetism in the magnet. It must not be very
difficult, because a usual price for a speedo overhaul/ calibration is about $75.
$75 won't get you very much these days!
My first 70 bus clear back in  1982 read incredibly high, not because of the
tires. I suspect others in this era were also off. My 69 double cab seems spot on,
however.
