After having spent this afternoon putting the transaxle into my '75 Westy, 
and after a hot tub and some Scotches to erase the painful memory, is there 
a wrong way and a right way to put the axles back on?  As in outer and 
inner?  Every time I work on these &quot;machines&quot;, I am impressed with their 
&quot;simplicity&quot;, with &quot;square head&quot; logic, kinda like having windshield wipers 
with no washers, in the fall here in the Pacific NW!
