&gt;I have to retighten mine every couple of weeks.  They simply come loose on 
&gt;their own.  Can't tighten them too much because the piece they are screwing 
&gt;into is plastic, and will crack (even the chrome ones are just 
&gt;chrome-plated plastic).  I don't believe this has ever been discussed on 
&gt;this list before - anyone have a solution to this problem?  I'm thinking 
&gt;loctite might be worth a shot.
PLease. The outer sliding door handle on my Westy Vanagon comes loose about
once a year, in spite of Locktite, and I have to yank the panel in order to
screw it back on.  Any fixes?
