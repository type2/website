Ok,
[...]
One more study of the Gene Berg catalog revealed this gem:

Page 154.  &quot;Timing Gear Kit&quot;
GB KIT-140  This kit contains one of each of the following (except as
noted):  VWB040-105-209.1 crank to camshaft timing gear, VWA111-105-213
timing gear woodruff key, VW113-105-219 genuine VW spacer, between the gears
(that we have never had one come off on a factory crankshaft), VWB
040-105-223.1 genuine VW brass distributor drive gear for longest life,
VW111-105-227 genuine VW snap ring, VW113-105-231 genuine VW distributor
drive pinion, VWA113-105-249 pulley woodruff key, VW113-105-241A genuine VW
oil slinger, VW115-105-233 drive pinion spring, 3 VW111-105-235A drive
pinions shims.

Sounds like all that I need, although I don't know why I need a &quot;oil
slinger&quot; and seems odd to me that they include a pulley woodruff key?

Anyway -- I presume I need all these bits and the kit is best route.

Gene Berg Enterprises catalog 1995/1996 edition, page 150.

 VWB040-105-209.1  Steel crankshaft gear to drive camshaft
 VWB040-105-223.1  Brass crank gear to drive the distributor
 VWB040-105-231.1  Dist drive pinion from brass gear to distributor
 VWB040-105-233   Dist drive pinion spring between drive pinion and
distributor
 VWB111-105-235A  Dist drive pinion gear end play thrust washer/spacer.

Ok, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to start from a scratch
longblock and go all new.  Tom Wilson book tells me I need at least two
washers, so I know that much.  Would this complete my longblock:

   3 washers (VWB111-105-235A)
   1 drive pinion (VWB040-105-231.1)
   1 spring ((VWB040-105-233)

And that would complete my distributor gear system, ready to drop the
distributor in?  Or do I need to be ordering any other components?
