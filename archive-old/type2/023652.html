You left out a few neccessary details, what year is your bus and are you 
talking about front or rear or both. Your rear stars are both at the bottem 
and your fronts are at 1 oclock and 7 oclock. Yes, it is posible for parts to 
rust in place especially if your wheel cyls are leaking, have you had the 
wheels off yet? If the bus has set for any length of time good preventative 
maint is to replace your wheel cyls and flush your brake sys.
