   hi volks
       i have started restoring a '74 westy. noticed the clutch will not
disengage. pulled the motor by myself in 2 hours! Woohoo. Turns out its a AW
(tyhink that means 1795cc). It is solex fed which leads me to believe it's
not original. anyhow when then clutch was exposed the pressure plate turned
out to be nothing but dust and some partial rings of what used to be
friction plate.
        My question is: what clutch plate do i need, seems there are 3 sizes
(200mm ,210mm, 215mm). I have a multi-finger diaphragm (18 fingers(must be
handy)). Is there a peticular brand i should look for? The throw-out bearing
is in good shape (still attached to fork, liitle pins still excellent shape)
should it be replaced?
        Any help would be greatly appreciated............
