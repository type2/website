Subject: Re: [T2] help w/engine swap

I would question the mechanics  knowledge/ability/honesty here.  Either he/she is
lying or doesn't know type 4 engines very well they are all nearly identical aside
from the exhaust ports even a vanagon aircooled is almost identical,( i believe
also that the configuration of the oil filler is somewhat different as well as
some other odds and ends but the block is nearly identical)  as for the fuel
injection it is easy to diagnose most problems with only a multi meter so again i
question the mechanics skills knowledge and honesty.. That's a problem with
vehicles as unique now as aircooled vws are, especially non beetles, its hard to
find mechanics that really know what they are doing.  As for honesty, a friend of
mine, a mechanic actually, once told me, &quot;if you know an honest mechanic you are a
very lucky man&quot;  I guess im pretty lucky then cause this guy is as honest as
anyone i've ever known and i trust him explicitly, but i know they can be hard to
find.  I've gone through several, for none vws also even my t*y*t* ive had some
whoppers told to me.  I always respond the same way, just cause i'm paying you to
fix my car doesn't mean i don't know what's broken and how to fix, i just don't
have the time or inclination to do it myself.  I was particularly lazy and had a
local mechanic replace a cv boot for me, its all that was wrong cvs going fine no
clicks no nothing, he calls me saying the joint is frozen and i need a new one and
it'll cost 300$ just for the joint, needless to say i never had him do anything
for me again.
good luck

&gt; &gt; My cousin blew the engine on her '78 Westy and bought a factory rebuilt
&gt; &gt; engine to replace it.  The shop installing it said it was a different type
&gt; &gt; of engine-though manufactured a few months apart-and had to modify it a bit
&gt; &gt; to get it to fit.

&gt; this is painful to read about.  I'm going to assume it's the 2L US
&gt; engine, right?
&gt;
&gt; I've never seen anything vastly different in them.  The engine cases are mostly
&gt; identical.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure what they would be modifying, maybe some tin, but certainly
&gt; nothing
&gt; on the engine?
