Subject: Re: 1976 LT28 Bus???

&gt;  Perhaps one of you could give me some idea what a 1976 VW LT28 camper
&gt;  is. There is one listed for sale in the local classifieds and I
don'tTexas

The LT is really a 'light truck'. It is basically Vanagon shaped and styled
but much bigger and heavier.
It has little relation with our air-cooled buses. It has a front mounted
engine between driver and passenger, diesel or petrol and rear wheel drive.

The first model has been in production for more than 20 years (from '75) and
was only recently superceded by the new LT (more Eurovan like, but still
big). LTs are mostly sold by MAN dealers. I 'm not sure how exactly but MAN
seems to belong to the VW group of companies as well.

The LT has been used for various camper conversions (also Westfalia) but the
numbers are quite low because of its much higher cost. Also it's not a
vehicle that you drive like a 'normal' car like our buses.

I hope that helps.
