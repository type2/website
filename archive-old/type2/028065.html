&gt;&gt;  Is this the only way to correct my problem? 

With all the past discussions on the &quot;hidden&quot; fuel tank, troublesome gauge sender unit, and cracked fuel lines, has anyone tried mounting a Vanagon (or similar - maybe even no-rust plastic!) tank under the belly and routing a filler neck to the panel behind the right front tire (again, like the Vanagon)?
