&gt; &gt; 	ALTERNATELY measure the height of the dome and the diameter, in 
&gt; &gt; mm, and find or work-out the formula for the volume of a dome. If
&gt; &gt; the dome is a hemisphere its easier, but there is a formula even if 
&gt; &gt; its not, I just can't work it out in my head quick like here.

Bill, 
Thanks for your post.  I did a rough calc on the dome volume a few weeks ago
with a Vernier caliper, but because of they way the measurements were taken
and the presence of an angle on the edge of the dome, i
don't trust the outcome: 

see the bottom of

http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/VW.html
 
HEIGHT OF DOME: 0.073 inches
 
VERY APPROXIMATE DIAMETER OF DOME: 1.850 inches
 
EVEN MORE APPROXIMATE VOLUME OF DOME: 3.217CC (metric: cubic 
centimeters)

Okay, there is a margin of error here (don't ask me to calculate the +/- 
those numbers are scary) because of the stickiness of the conversion factors.

Also, the volume of the dome was roughly measured with a VC and could be off a
little.
 
Okay, first of all, if you don't know, my 1800 type 4 is running dome-top
pistons while other bus engines i have seen run dishtop pistons. Compression
is lowered on type4 bus engines to keep them from running hot and dropping
valve seats, which they still do sometimes anyway.
We don't wanna drop valve seats. Baaad!  Baaad!

We need to bring the CR of this engine down to what it would be if the engine
were running dishtop pistons, and, ala Rube Goldberg, we're gonna use cylinder
shims to to raise the volume of the combustion chamber rather than just go out
and buy new dishtop pistons becuase we're poor.  Awww.
 
Having said that, on to the numbers.


Lets say 3.2cc (0.195 cubic inches) is the volume of the dome just for kicks.


To calculate height of shim we need to know the volume of a given length of
the 93mm (3.66&quot;)ID cylinder. 

Since we're looking for thousandths cause we're in America (go ask a German
engineer for a &quot;fifteen thousandths barrell shim&quot; and he'll probably toss his
brau in your face) 
Lets say we calc volume of 1&quot; (or 1000 thousandths)of the 3.66&quot; ID cylinder:
 
Volume of cylinder = (pi X radius squared) X (height)
pi=3.14
 
Radius squared = 1.83 X 1.83 = 3.35
 
(3.14 X 3.35) X (1.00) = 10.519 cubic inches.
 
One thousandth of this volume is .010519 cubic inches.
 
Howabout for eight thousandths of that one inch of height?
 
(3.14 X 3.35) X (.008)  = .084152 cubic inches
 
3.2cc = .195 cI (volume of dome)
 
1cc = .006 cI 
 
.084152 cubic inches = 1.379cc 
 
1.379cc is the metric volume of an .008&quot; slice of 93mm cylinder and
consequently the displacement increase a .008 shim should cause.
 
I cc'd one of my dished pistons last night and found the dish to be 10cc.

The heads, according to muir and every other source i can find are stock 1974
1800 bus heads.
 
If the volume if the Dome is 3.2 cc and the dish in a standard bus 1800 piston
is 10cc (total 13.2cc), in order to raise the deck height to compensate for
the dish and the dome and bring the CR to what it would be if the engine were
running dishtops, 
 
13.2cc (total volume of dome and dish combined) / 1.397cc (disp increase .008
shim causes in 93mm cylinder) = 9.45 SO,
 
9.45 1.397cc increases in displacment or, a .075 shim (or 9-10 stock .008
shims) under the cylinder would bring me back to a stock bus CR - this in
addition to the .025 'head gasket'.

Wow. that sure seems like alot, donthca think?

I would happily (gleefully!) welcome someone checking my numbers - George L. :
 This sounds like a good question to teach conversion factors to some basic
math students.
