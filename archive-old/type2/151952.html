Subject: Re: [T2] 180 passenger seat swivel?

&gt; I did that install in my westfakia back in the spring of 2001. I cut
&gt; the swivel base from an early vanagon with an angle grinder and
&gt; welded it between the rails of my original passenger seat. It would
&gt; be difficult to bolt this part into place without destroying the
&gt; original seat tracks, that's why I welded mine.
&gt;
&gt; This mod will work with any 76-later &quot;sliding seat track&quot; bus. The
&gt; only down side is that it will add about an inch and a half of
&gt; altitude to the passenger.
&gt;
&gt; Any 76-later westy will have the bracket you need.

I've given VERY very serious thought to doing that, considering I already
have vanagon seats in the front though I'm wondering weather I might be
too high and have to do something to lower em while welding it in?!

anyone got a set for sale or &quot;get rid of&quot;
