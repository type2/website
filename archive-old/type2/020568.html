Subject: Re:Welder opinion

I wanted to thank everyone for info on different welders and what they
use. I happened to mention to my
father in law that I wanted to purchases a welder. He's letting me keep
his he purchased a couple of years ago.
A nice mig with a fairly full gas bottle.It's 110 so I can plug in
anywhere. Not sure what brand just know he paid
about $700.00 for it. I am going to pick it up this weekend along with a
quick lesson from him and start practicing
for next winters body work. Again, thanks for everyones reply.
Regards,
Bill
