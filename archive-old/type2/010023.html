Subject: Roof rack for a '74 Bus.
Message-Id: &lt;199906302221.RAA19944_at_ux8.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Alrighty ...

  It has become clear to me that finding a roof rack for a '74 Bus is
difficult ... and when one is found, it's expensive.  So, I've decided
that I want to make one myself.

  Only problem is that I don't know where I should start.  Should I use
piping?  Where do I secure it?  I found 4 screws midway up the side of the
bus ... is it okay to tap into this?  Should I drill through the roof and
use bolts?

  If anyone else has tried to rig a roof rack on their bus, please give me
an idea of what I should do.  I would really appreciate it.

  Thanks,

	Wade
