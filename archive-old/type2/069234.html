Michael Heron and Bob Wallace wondered:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If Kombis were sold with optional headliners
&gt;
&gt;dunno about that have never seen a gennie kombi w/
&gt;headliner, have other people?
&gt;
Let's wrap this up: VW dealers were supplied with a Technical Bulletin
which gave plans for fabricating hardboard panels to line the interior
sides and roof of the Kombi for customers who so desired. These parts were
not an option as such and were not available as parts. They were
aftermarket fitments by VW dealers, fabricated by the dealer.

I have a copy of one of these Technical Bulletins, and my 57 Kombi is
fitted with hardboard panels in back which are *very* similar to those in
the plans/photographs in the Tech Bulletin.

Hope that clears up this issue.
