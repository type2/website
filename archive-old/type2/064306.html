Subject: Torque those CVs!

OK-

I learned my lesson well, and I want to pass my knowledge on to others.

TORQUE THOSE CV BOLTS DOWN RIGHT GOOD!

I found this out yesterday on my way home from work.  Pulled up to a stop sign, pulled out thru the intersection.  Immediately lost all momentum and ability to move forward.  I pulled over to the side of the road thinking &quot;damn shift coupler came loose.&quot;  Crawled underneath, looked at shift linkage, and caught a glimpse of an axle shaft hanging down from the drivers side wheel!  I immediately remembered the observation of my wife on friday:  &quot;What's that clunking noise coming from the back end?!?&quot;  (Memo to myself: Listen to your wife.)

So, I bolted the CV back to the trans, most of the bolts were bent, so only about 3 went on, but I got home (slowly) and switched places with my '88 Nissan (also under construction) in the garage.  Guess I'll drive the Nissan for awhile even tho it needs front wheel bearings (Major $$$ BTW on a nissan).

Lessons For The Day:

Torque those CV bolts!  Listen to the SO!  Learn from my mistakes.
