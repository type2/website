Subject: Re: [T2] Annoying little things......

&gt;I have a couple of questions for the list.......................
&gt;
&gt;2nd) Why after driving a while, there is smoke coming out of the dash, near
the windshield? It smells like burnt motor oil, or other oils.
3rd) Does anyone have a complete dash, with steering wheel for sale in good
condition for a 1973 bus??
Thanks to all in advance.....

Alex---I've had this happen...had a small leak at the oil cooler
(noooo...say it ain't so!)  which dripped down onto the exhaust manifold and
was subsequently sucked into the heater ducts leading to the front...I bet
if you turn off the heat, the smoke stops...keep your windows open, natch!
          Sorry no dash though...
