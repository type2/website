Subject: Re: Seat Belts

I did this with my '66 Kombi. I put three seat belts in the back by
drilling 3/8&quot; holes in the appropriate locations and putting in the
standard VW seat belt bolts. However, I'm thinking of reinforcing them by
JB Welding some nuts there, too. I can now seat belt 7 (just like a
m*****n). :)

P. S. Will my '66 be highly desirable in Arizona after the smog regs change?


&gt;I am wondering if you can help me.  I am looking for a VW camper bus, but
&gt;my wife (with good reason) insists that there be seat belts for 5.  What
&gt;year (if at all ) did they start putiing seat belts in for passengers.  I
&gt;would appreciate any help or info.
