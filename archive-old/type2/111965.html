Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

&gt; &gt; Will a 72-79 cable work in my '71?  Please let me know.  My local VW guy
&gt; &gt; only has a late bay cable.  I was driving to school this morning and it
&gt; &gt; broke.  I had a cable but the wrong one.  It was for my '60!
&gt;
&gt; 73-74    3655mm
&gt; 76-79MT  3458mm
&gt; 76-79AT  2870mm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ummm, an Automatic Transmission clutch cable?  Are you sure this isn't a
listing of throttle cables?
