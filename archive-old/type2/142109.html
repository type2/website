Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to
  your bus

Whoops, thanks for the correction Karl,
I knew what I meant but didn't say it.

Quoting Karl &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;:

&gt; The DISC stops spinning when you step on the clutch.
&gt; The PRESSURE PLATE or clutch cover is bolted to the flywheel and
&gt; always stays spinning.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't shoot the messenger:)
