Subject: Removing Front Shocks Question
Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2001 07:53:44 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all:

Since I replace the front shocks on my '81 Vanagon only 10-12 years
ago you'd think I'd know the answer to this question, wouldn't you?

I'm trying to remove the top nut, but the whole assembly (nut and
threaded portion of shock) is turning.  I don't think it's corrosion -
everything looks clean and bright - but simply &quot;sticktion&quot; between the
parts.  There's a small unthreaded portion of the shock above the
threaded part, but I've not had any success clamping on to this to
prevent the assembly from turning.

Any hints on how this is done?

TIA.
