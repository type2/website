Hola Volks,

I have a lot of misc. body, interior, and mechanical parts under my house in
San Diego.  I'm thinking of going to Pomona to sell them off.  I have a set
of bumpers, 68 door handles (one year only I think), doors, some glass,
misc. trim and lights, dash board, front and middle seats, door panels, and
a lot of misc. mechanical parts.  Most parts are from 68 and 71.  I would
like to lighten the load before I drag it all to Pomona.  I drive to L.A.
every Saturday so delivery is possible in San Diego, Orange County and Los
Angeles.  I LOVE DRIVING MY BUS.  IM A DRIVIN FOOL!  So if anybody needs
more info, pmail me.  I'll be taking inventory tonight.

Keep on Bussin'
