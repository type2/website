&gt;and it has once again eaten most of the brake fluid.
&gt;Note that this is after a brand shtinking new master cylinder.  
&gt;NO external leakage.

There has to be external leakage if the fluid is disappearing.  Maybe
your new MC is a bad?  The most common place for brake fluid to
&quot;disappear&quot; to has always been straight into the brake booster.  The MC
leaks at the shaft and drains right in there, eventually filling that
bad boy up.  Unforturnately, you'll have to remove either the MC or the
booster to check it.  Other than that, check for moistness around the
rear cylinders and the lower sides of the front calipers and the under
side of the MC itself (esp. around where the electrical sensors screw
in).  The fluid is coming out somewhere...

Good luck.
