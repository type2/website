Subject: Getting Dizzy (long but confusing :)

Some of you may have seen the unspellchecked version on vintagebus :)

Whilst doing a keyword search for parts on www.busdepot_dot_com I stumbled upon
part# 231 173 005 which is  VW 021 905 205 which is a 1972 only distributor.
For about three years the '72 Westfakia has been running with a 009 and a
Weber 32/36 carb. When I got the bus it had the 021 905 205 E installed with
the Weber and it ran ok(vac advance hooked up but not retard) but I was told
by a mechanic that it was worn and needed to be replaced. That original
dizzy has been in the back of the bus since then and occasionally I take it
out and show to people and ask them what they think. Most recently Steve
Dolan and Nikki spent about 30 minutes at EveryBus(yeah, I know I have not
posted my trip report yet:) and dissected it. Steve determined that I could
be rebuilt but needed a new vac can as the retard diaphragm was not
operating.

I have often thought that It would be nice to go back to the smoother dual
advance/vac retard dizzy. There is a vac port on the manifold for advance
and a vac port on the Weber 32/36 that could be uncapped for the retard.
The question is do I need retard? Recent posts argue that vac retard is only
for emissions and does not affect performance.

I decided to call Bus Depot to find out if they really had it and if the
price was really $109. As it turns out they can get a rebuilt one in a week
and there is a $30 core charge. I decided to think about it some more.

A check of the Bentley got me thinking about what I really need. With the
009 I set the total advance to about 30 btdc which puts it at about 3 or 4
degrees btdc static(idle.) With the stock 205 timing would start at 5atdc
with both vac hoses on.

Now  this is where I need a &quot;list&quot; reality check. Let's all turn in our
Bentley's to Section 5 page 75.  If I am reading this correctly..........

Vacuum timing range from Bentley Sec5 page 75 table J
Set the timing at 5 atdc with hoses on. At idle, vac from the carb holds the
timing at 5atdc. As the throttle is applied the vac retard decreases and
allows the timing to advance aprox 11 to 15 from its starting point of
5atdc. This would put timing at 6 to 10dgrs btdc. Vac from the manifold is
now taking over and advancing the timing a further 8 to 12 dgrs for a
current sub total of 14 to 22 dgrs btdc.(This cannot be right.)  No RPMs are
listed in this part of the table because vacuum is doing the work. It would
seem logical that as the advance that is driven by vacuum action is
increasing the mechanical (centrifugal advance) is kicking in. I dont think
my math is correct here. Retard vac is coming off the carb and advance is
coming off the manifold. As the throttle opens the carb vac decreases and
the manifold vac increases so there must be an overlap. If so, I am not
certain where this occurs. At some point the centrifugal advance kicks in
so......

Let's move to the centrifugal timing range which does have RPMs listed in 4
columns. Again this is for the 021 905 205 E.
In the third column we have listed 2000 RPM 13-16dgrs. In the fourth column
which is titled 'END' we have 3600 RPM 23-26dgrs. It appears that vacuum
advance begins to wane  at 8- 12 dgrs(this makes more sense ) of advance and
mechanical picks up takes over in the 13-16 degree range(at 2000rpm) and
tops out at 23-26dgrs at 3600 rpm.

I am inclined to believe that &quot;End / 3600 rpms 23-26 degrees is the total
amount of advance .  But 26dgrs from where? certainly not from 5 atdc that
would put spark at 21 btdc and that cant be right. Some folks have told me
that it is 26 from where the retard gives out which would put spark at 37 to
41 degrees btdc and that seems kinda high.

Here is what could be happenng expressed in a funky ASCII chart. I could be
really wrong here folks and would like some feedback from listmembers and
perhaps others could use the same format to post what they think is
happening.
