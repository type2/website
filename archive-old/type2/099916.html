Subject: Times they are a changing

I started out as one of the &quot;hippies&quot;, skipped the &quot;yuppie&quot; era and 
stumbled back in 18 years after giving my 69 pop top to my brother. I 
drove that one for 11 years.

I started with VWs in 1963 when I was stationed in Holland, got a neat 
coupe, not with the hatch back, or Bug. In 70 hooked up with a splity 
with a small pop top, forgot the year, traded it in the 69 Westy in 
1975.

In august I bought a 69 Westy. I bet there a lot of people just like me 
returning to the &quot;old daze&quot;.

Is the other half (gracefully) aging hippies?

BTW, this list is a tremendous resource, I love it.

&lt; It seems that years ago when nobody wanted a VW bus any more they were
&lt;taken over by the hippy cult, now as things in this country progressed 
they
&lt;were taken over by the yuppie cult (driving up the values and 
demand)and as
&lt; things continue to go on our buses seem to be taken over by the 
computer
&lt;geek (no offense to anyone, please). It seems that at least half of the
&lt;people I deal with for parts on their buses jobs seem to have 
something to
&lt;do with computers!
&lt;   Who or WHAT will the next generation of bus owners be
