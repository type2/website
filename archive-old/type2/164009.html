Subject: Hot VW Magazine/Bus BRR!

Hey, Volks:

Hot VW Magazine's Events Section says it's just about time to put on the VW
logo johns, pack the hand warmers, electric heater and fire up the flat
four.  Is Kirt bringing some of his famous &quot;Westy Wheat&quot;?

Joe'sVan will be rolling in about 12:30-1:00 to campground #3.  Park Ranger
Ted will again have a nice big bundle of Indiana hardwood for our fire.
Call me on my cell at (574) 286-0848 if you need directions or any help.

Forecast is for a high of 20 on Saturday and a low of 5.  Last year, we had
a high 24 and a low of 11.  Chance of snow of this year is 30% in the
morning, then partly cloudy.  Brien Dews is working hard on adjusting his
transmission linkage so he can make the trip and deliver the cool Bus BRR
Hoodies.

See all you hardy campers when you get there!
