Subject: [T2] Windshield replace-temporary solution for a permanentproblem

&gt; Has anyone used this * Extend* stuff, does it really
&gt; work to help stop the spread of the rust, that's living * very healthy* in
&gt; this bus.

Well, no matter what you use I suspect the rust will be back soon. The real
problem is that you probably cannot get to all the places that are rusty. If
you do it right you'd have to wirebrush (use your drill with a round
wirebrush) all the rust away and seal the surface with a proper coating. But
... the rust will most likely be present on the inside of the panels as
well. If you talk about dollar size spots (holes?) then it's already bad.
I've had rusty spots that looked tiny (like 0.1 by 01. inch) but on closer
examination were rusted thru entirely. Start wirebrushing and when all the
rust is removed you may end up having a 2 x 2 inch hole that really needs
welding.

Unless you are able to remove all the rust, inside and out, the 'cancer'
will spread. I've done the simple type of repair and I do recommend you to
take care of any rust you see. However it will keep the bus decent for only
a short while, maybe a couple of months maybe a year. So that's why I've now
started doing more permanent repairs. Cut out the bad parts and weld in new
material. Even that is not without it's problems. We are all fighting a
battle we will eventually loose.

I wish they'd made them buses from stainless steel or aluminium .........
(should I get myself a De Lorean ?)
