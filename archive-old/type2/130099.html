Subject: Bad Head (was Crankcase Ventilation)

Well, it's the craziest thing I've seen this week.  It looks like I didn't 
cross-thread the spark plug after all.  The threads for the spark plug 
appear to be in the cylinder head.  It's as if the threads were part of a 
cylinder that was pressed into the head, and the thread cylinder and the 
head have separated.  How odd.

  I'll know more when I pull the engine and open the head later 
today/tomorrow.  Anyway, it looks like I'm going to need yet another 
cylinder head.  At least I'll have done both heads &quot;at the same time&quot;, or 
within 2 miles of each other.

Honestly, I'm not looking forward to dropping the engine by myself, 
*again*.  I hope this is the last time for a while.
