Subject: ECU ID

Hi Volks,

I have a yellow-stickered ECU here with the following part number:

0 399 060 21B

I have found references to this part in the archives, but none of them 
say what it came from.

Here's your chance to add some useful info for the next person's search!

Thanks,


Greg Potts
