Subject: Rear Axle Nut Problem

George Lyle --

As usual you've given an excellent tip.  I've had good luck using a
Dremel tool with cutoff disk.  Didn't cut all the way through, but
with patience and a couple of cuts, weakened the nut enough that I was
then able to remove it with no risk to the axle threads.

Usual qualifiers:  I have no Dremel investment or connection...  YMMV,
FWIW, etc.

Regards
Glenn

==============REF===================

The one time I had to cut off an axle nut, my father showed me a way.
You
need a hefty 4X4 or larger that is just long enough for the nut to sit
upon with the 4X4 holding up the bus.  You also need a piece of 1/4
inch
or thicker steel to go between the nut and the wood.

Jack the bus up, let it down on the 4x4/steel, so that the weight of
the
bus rests on the 4X4.  Don't remove the jack, though.  Now take a
sharp
chisel and use it to cut the nut, cutting stright down toward the
ground.

the idea here is that the 4x4 transfers the force of the blows
directly to
the ground before it has a chance to damage the bearings.
