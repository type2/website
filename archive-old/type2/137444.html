&lt;&lt; Reading between the lines of the article, it looks like the problem was
with the non-sodium chloride deicers and sheet and cast aluminum.  The
cost diferences are mentioned, but there is no mention of the corrosion
problem with salt and steel and I would bet that there are significant
differences that are being glossed over.  Their implied solution is to buy
a newer car, with more plastic, fiberglass, or stainless steel parts...
I'm thinking that a Trabant would fit this description :-)

OOK! &gt;&gt;

Irv Gordon, owner/driver of the world champ mileage car (Volvo
1800 with 2 million on the clock and counting) has an upward
spraying device in his driveway that sprays ordinary water up
to clean off the underside of his Volvo...It's the salt and water
that does the steel in, not clean water... :-(
