Subject: Synth Oil - last installment for a while
Mime-Version: 1.0

I tried my first synth oil today in my Westy's Type IV. First thing I
noticed was that my Type IV's hesitation
went away, and the bus idles a little faster - maybe 75 rpm. 

My engine's hesitation happened mostly when the engine was cold (oil was
cold?) so maybe this was a function of oil pressure? 

The idle speed maybe a function of the lighter oil - 5W-30 versus 10W-40?
Just curious.

Anyone ever documented an increase in fuel mileage with a lighter oil? How
much?

Don't know about any leaks so far, I write about that later, but my lifters
seem to like it. Still haven't readjusted my lifters as per your advice
Karl vS. They seem to be quieter. 

The oil I drained out of my Westy wasn't watery this time, but somewhat
thinner than new oil. 

Can't give an evidence but it does seem like the motor runs smoother and a
bit quieter but then, I think it runs better after it gets a wash and wax......

Thanks to all of you for your personal experiences. I'll continue to
research this and will post an update if I get any real evidence on way or
another.
