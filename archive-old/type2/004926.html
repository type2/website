Hey Shawn,

When I had to get some studs for my Vanagon, I ran into the same problem
with the local FLAPS supply. Instead of drilling my hubs, I took the studs
and used the bench grinder to take off most of the knurling on the shank of
the stud. It was not as hard as I thought it would be to take it off pretty
evenly (I did have to use a file to take off the radius left at the
shank/head intersection). Then I pulled them through the hole with a spare
lug nut, a socket for a spacer and a lot of loctite blue for lubricant. It
trashed the lug nut, but it pulled them through fine and snug. Loctite green
or red would be more appropriate. (I did have a caliper to measure with,
maybe not a good idea without one.)

I was paranoid that one would loosen when I tightened the lug nuts (that
would have been bad news!) but it went fine. I too thought about drilling,
but I could not be sure of the exact size bit to use, and those flanges are
really thick too. I think that the grinding procedure qualifies as closest
to the DM under a casual interpretation.

Good Luck,

Subject: [T2] Wheel studs/chrome bumpers


&gt; Hello everyone!
&gt;
&gt;      I found some longer wheel studs for my bus at my flaps. Cost me
&gt; $2.25 Ea. Only thing is, I'll have to have my hubs drilled a bit bigger
&gt; then press the new studs in. the studs are a bit bigger where they are
&gt; pressed in the hub, but there a 14mm x1.5 thread. I'm going to try to
&gt; find another set of hubs, so I can keep the originals, that way if I
&gt; ever sell my bus I can put it back to original. And keep my nice alloys.
&gt;
&gt;      I also found a set of nice original chrome bumpers, off of a 79'
&gt; champaign ed. bus. They even have the impact strips in good shape.
&gt;      I'll have to get some pictures when finished!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
