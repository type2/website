Subject: [T2] crankshaft discoloration

Hi, I got my engine apart now and i'am wondering if my
crankshaft is bad or good. The Wilson book says hot spots
will turn blue and cooler spots will turn black. I have
two blue spots not very big but none the less its a color
change. I didnt have any spun bearings or a thrown rod...
The crank is mostly dark brown, its a type4 engine.
Will a crankshaft that has never been overheated be all
brown and have no other discoloration from normal use?

Alex Wisniewski,
