Man...does this mean I need a full medical staff the next time I burn my
finger on my bus???

You guys are right at the edge of dropping a valve with this one.  I say run
some cold water on it, bust the blister, and cuss a lot about how much it
hurts while you change your oil.

Of actions vary if it is bad enough to actually go to the hospital. I will
let them treat it.

if you do choose the first option you can brag about the battle scar later
at the FLAPS near you, as you try and convince the Chevy owners that an
air-cooled engine is a reliable beast.

Of course they want believe you, but since you have a scar they will regard
you as a true motor-head and call you names like bubba, and dude.  That's
when the sharing of war stories will start and the next thing you know you
will be hanging with them at the local pub drinking Guiness and complaining
about how much it makes you go to the jon.

Blister on bus brothers and sisters, blister on!

Written with the maximum amount of levity I can muster on a Monday,

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
