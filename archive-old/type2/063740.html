&gt;So speaketh Lisa Quinn:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The evil dealer had put the flex plate in. But had
&gt;&gt; broken the throttle cable. He also claimed to have
&gt;&gt; replaced the engine and transmission oil seals. 
&gt;&gt; But on the way hom, Van sprang a leak. Curses!! 
&gt;
&gt;Lisa, 
&gt;
&gt;T'would be good of thee to mention the evil troll
&gt;of a dealers name so-est the rest of us do not
&gt;cross-eth his path unawares.....  :)
&gt;
Evil dealer = Autohaus, in Harrisburg and Lancaster PA
