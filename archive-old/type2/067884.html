Just to ask:  Have you checked it (had it checked) on an alignment jig?

I would agree with Jeff's theory about tire balance.  I replied to your message
because I was going to suggest getting new front tires before this trip (I always
do that, but, I have a weekly paycheck, so I'm spoiled).  But you already did that...
I have come to appreciate the spin balancer.

My father was a Diesel truck mechanic, and I remember the way he used to balance
truck tires with a spirit bubble thing.

I inherited his tools, and he was completely into Craftsman.  Even though most of the 
tools have been stolen :-( over the years, I often like to dig around in the boxes of 
things like 1-1/2&quot; drive ratchets, and pullers for Truck wheels :-)  Man, I miss him.
