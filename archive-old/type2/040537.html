Subject: Does Anyone Have a VW For Sale?

Hello,
   Does anyone out there know about or own a VW bus
that they would sell in the Maryland area?  I have
been looking for one for a long time and have no luck.
 I would like it to be in OK condition-running a
little rust.  Thanks a lot for your help.  I had a few
respond on my other ? and this list is great.

Thanks again.

Peace,
Tim Hayes
