Subject: Starter is in and working BUT...

Hello All,

Thanks againg to all who responded about the D-shaped bolt on the starter.  I 
got the old one out relatively easily and got the new one about the same.  Mr. 
Bananahead (my daughters named him) now starts up and runs just fine.

However...there was a brass bushing included with the new starter and the guy 
at my VWFLAPS made sure to mention installing it with the new starter.

When I took the old one out there was not a bushing on it and I could not dig 
one out from anywhere.  I could also after about 40 minutes of trying get the 
new bushing to go into the motor housing no matter what I tried.

Is this bushing only for some models/years of VWs and my '76 FI doesn't need 
it? Or am asking for trouble and the cost of another starter if I don't 
install this?

I'd appreciate any advice/experience anyone has on this.
