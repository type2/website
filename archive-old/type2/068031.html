Subject: AS21 vs AS41 cases , hard numbers

 I don't think this got back to the type2 list so I'm taking the
liberty in hopes there are a few who would like the data.

 Thanks to Bill Claspy on the VINTAGVW List.

Hello!

Just happen to be a librarian at an engineering library, so this is in
response to Mike West's request for info on the case alloys used.  His
guess of 20-30% aluminum is just a little off :-) (his text follows my
numbers)

&gt;From the ASM Metals Handbook, V.2, 10th edition, 1990

Room Temperature properties:

AS21            1.7% Al
                .4% Mn
                1.1% Si
                240 MPa Tensile Strength
                130 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
                130 MPa Compressive Yield Strength

AS41A           4.3% Al
                .35% Mn
                1.0% Si
                220 MPa Tensile Strength
                150 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
                150 MPa Compressive Yield Strength

&quot;AS41A has creep strength much superior to that of AZ91D or AM60B alloys at
temperatures up to 175C (350F)... AS21 alloy exhibits even better creep
strength than AS41A.  However, AS21 has lower room-temperature tensile and
yield strengths, and it is somewhat more difficult to cast.&quot;

Hope this helps!  And if anyone deems it important enough to stick these
numbers in a FAQ, feel free.

 Matt sez:
&gt;&gt;&quot;This case is made of the AS41 material which has a new alloy composition
&gt;&gt;consisting of 4% aluminum compared to the AS21 case that had 2%.  This AS41
&gt;&gt;case is more durable than the AS21 material used in the past.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This may help put some minds at ease for those who are planning to purchase
&gt;&gt;cases in the future, FWIW.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was able to sort out a few technical issues with Clyde Berg on the phone
&gt;&gt;relating to cam selection and carb jet sizes.  Should take delivery in three
&gt;&gt;weeks.  Its like Christmas in November!

Mike West sez:

&gt;  What I would like to see is the &quot;Spec&quot; sheets on the 2 alloys.
&gt;
&gt; Here's what I have: AS100: been around for a long time so it's listed
&gt;in my &quot;Kents handbook&quot; on design.
&gt;
&gt; Composition: Aluminum; 9.0-11.0 %
&gt;              Manganese; 0.10 %
&gt;              Zinc;      0.3 % max
&gt;              Silicon;   1.0 % max
&gt;              Copper;    0.5 % max
&gt;              Nickel;    0.03 % max
&gt;              Iron;       zip
&gt;              Magnesium;  remainder
&gt;
&gt;  Having read a lot of these &quot;spec&quot; sheets in my previous life, I
&gt;would expect AS21 to have 20-30% Al.
&gt; And AS41 to have as much as 50% Al.
&gt;
&gt; I submit that our &quot;Bergness&quot; is biting wind but am the first to admit
&gt;I can't prove it yet.
&gt;
&gt; Isn't there one Mechanical Engineer out there with a &quot;Library&quot; who
&gt;can look this stuff up?
&gt;
&gt; Oh, I checked with ASTM and they claim only to &quot;list&quot; an &quot;AS41&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Of course they won't &quot;give&quot; me the &quot;specs&quot;  but will sell me the the
&gt;&quot;spec sheet&quot;.
