Subject: Re: [T2] generator or alternator?

12V generator, lucky (imho) for you... as long as someone hasn't changed it.  
Easy to tell - the generator is long and round like a bologna, the alt. is 
lumpy like that on a US or Japanese car.

A generator is a lot easier for you to do both a &quot;quickie overhaul&quot; a'la 
muir, (read the book, it works!) or to do a bearing swap (Yes, it can be 
done, saving like $80 from the 2nd exchange on - It's easy, and I'll tell 
more if you wish later) than an alternator.  The alt. does put out a better 
charge but when a diode goes out it's not fun to fix unless you like testing 
and soldering (and unsoldering!)...  and they *still* have the same prob. 
when the bearings go out, except 1-more $$$ to swap, and 2-I've never done a 
bearing swap on an alt, and I've heard it's hard.

In fact, I have even done what I call the quick and dirty armature hone on a 
generator with a file (It was **that** bad!) and brought it back to life.  I 
don't think you can do that with an alternator, tho don't quote me.
