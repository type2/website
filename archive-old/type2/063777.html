Subject: 1-piece vs. 2-piece paneling ('76 to ?'78?)

Over the weekend, I installed a replacement (and much nicer) set of panels
in my '76 Westy.  The original panel behind the sink and icebox units was
virtually one piece, with a ~4&quot; filler up near the drivers seat.  The
replacment set was two panels with an &quot;H&quot;-section joint just to the left
of the sink cabinet.  I believe the replacement panels came from a '78,
but are certainly from the same interior series.  Also The '76 panels were
actual wood on the face, whereas the replacements were a plastic contact
paper with a wood grain print.  The grain on both sets of panels was
vertical, so someone somewhere in Germany is/was making plywood panels
with the grain running sideways.  While not directly applicable to y'all
who are trying to figure out the vagaries of split window paneling, I
figured that I would post this to add one more factoid to the fire :-&gt;
