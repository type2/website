&gt;Update on Bulley Tek, re: tapping to break bonds.
&gt;
&gt;Removed a steering wheel from a Type II, 75 Westy, yesterday. The shaft is
forced to the center of the upper bearing by a tapered metal cage. Tried
several standard teks and could not make it budge. Tapped the end of the
shaft with a 4 oz ball pein for a minute maybe?? Then was able to use a
drift and 30 oz hammer to tap it up and out. Next time I will use 2 minutes
tapping before removal.
&gt;
&gt;Happy Bullenium, one year early.
