Brad:
I can't say where you can get the cables, Wolfsburg West has Bug ones. I've
worked on a cpuple of them and I can tell you one thing that may not be obvious:

The crank assembly (with the handle) has built in stops. And buses, bugs, volvos
(?) and Vanagons all use similar pieces but they are different inside, i.e.,
different number of revolutions from stop to stop. I don't think Mr. Bentley
talks about this piece at all, but if Golde (the manufacturer) thought they
needed to protect the cables from running past the end of their travel, that's
how they should be installed.
In other words, install the cables, run the roof panel completely closed, crank
the handle to the end of its travel (bays are 23 turns, Vanagons 27 turns, bugs
13 turns, if my memory serves correctly), slide the handle up into place, maybe
you might have to back the handle up one or two teeth, to allow the slider to
reach the end of its travel just as the handle reaches its stop. The handle
definitely has enough power to ruin the new cables if it doesn't get stopped by
its own mechanism.
Please write back and let us know how you come out, cause I've only done one of
these completely and there's probably a lot more I need to know.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;    I have a quick question, I have a '79 bus with a sun roof, what I need to
&gt; do is replace the sun roof, and all the cables. I was wondering if anybody
&gt; knows where I can buy those items.
