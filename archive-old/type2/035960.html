You didn't say where you are (geographically).  Any snow out there?  Some
list members have too much of it.  Why not shovel snow under the bus, then
have
the rollback guy attach his winch....... you get the idea.  Nice to get some
small benefit from the stuff!

Failing that, why not get a pair of garage dollies (4 casters, not 2 legs).
These are sold for people who want to move dead cars around their garages.
I used them in a case like yours and they worked great..... unless your CO
is unwilling to let you jack up the van in order to put them in place.  Good
luck!
