Subject: Re: [T2] Auxillary battery

John,

I have a '79 Auto Westfalia that I use about 9 months of the year.

I run a dual LCD screen system in my bus and it works flawlessly.

Its a 12V system that plugs into a standard 12V accessory outlet that can be
easily wired through the fuse panel.

I don't have an auxiliary battery, I have a BA6 and a fridge and I have
never had a problem yet, but I suspect it would be nice to have, just in
case.

Mind you , I don't run all those with the vehicle off, I usually switch over
to 120V when I arrive.

Jamie Rivers (jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net) has a diagram on wiring up an aux
battery, its probably in the archives or the library somewhere.

&gt; So would electrical requirements for these things
&gt; dictate that I hook up an auxillary battery??
&gt; In the T2 library, found an article about hooking one
&gt; of these up, but the reading wasn't very
&gt; user-friendly. I will never have a need to run a
&gt; fridge off of this system, only small 9 inch tv\vcr
&gt; and a gas heater. Anyone have any advice about an easy
&gt; set up to do this??
&gt; So does someone sell a kit to add this, I need easy
&gt; install and clear directions.
