If it's the brown box that used to be a ladies cosmetic or small
overnightcase, it came from my attic!  I was the second/third hubcap
recipient (a lowly cardboard box sent to me and provided the classy
case, and everyone started putting vw related souveoirs (sp?) into it)!
I think each recipient should take OUT something and insert their own
memento!

&gt; The hub cap and tour box are alive and well.  Me and a fellow club
&gt; member are going down to pick it up Sunday and take it to Dubuque, IA
&gt; where we will be meeting up with some vintagebus listees from Nebraska
&gt; and doing the hand-off.  I thought you guys might like to know.
&gt; A trip report will most likely be posted on late sunday night or monday.
