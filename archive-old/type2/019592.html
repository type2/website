Ben,
You could get a frequency to voltage converter chip and route the output to a voltage
comparator.  The other input to the comparator would be wired to a hidden
potentiometer that will allow you to dial in the warning point.
Depending upon how she drives you may need to hook up three of these comparators.  The first
would have the adjustable set points and the other two just 250 rpm
higher than the previous.
Say your set point is 3500 rpm
3500 RPM the warning light comes on
3750 the warning buzzer starts
4000 the relay closes to the auxiliary high voltage coil and the electrodes in the driver's
seat provides her with a &quot;mild&quot; reminder to shift gears.

The converter is an LM2907N  ($2.28 from digikey_dot_com)
The comparator that you can use is a LM339NNS  (quad comparator, $0.46)

Add some wires, resistors, light and buzzer and you are well on your way.
To be safe, you might leave off the HV &quot;mild reminder&quot; device.  I think she can most likely
think of a dozen ways to pay you back for that one.

Scott
