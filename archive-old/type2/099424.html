&gt;Hi Dr Tim and august list...I posted a question I got no reply to, regarding
&gt;putting in a later FI harness, throttle/airbox, AFM, and ECU in a 75 bus,

Mixing parts is an experiment. You've come up with a theory. You will have 
to do the experiment to determine if it will work to your satisfaction. If 
you have convinced yourself that you don't have to set it up stock, please 
don't ask me to validate your assumption that it &quot;should work&quot;. My 
assumption is, it can't work as well as stock specs. Run your experiment at 
your own input of time/money and let us know the good, bad and ugly. It is 
apparent from the lack of responses that this has not been setup often 
among the listees. Buy new stock parts while they are still available and 
you probably will get far more miles with far fewer frustrations. It's the 
only prudent advise I can give and have best certainty of good results. Do 
you put into play or take out of play the knowledge of the best engineers 
in the world??
