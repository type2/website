Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

-
&gt; I think all my T4 stuff is gone, but I might have a
&gt; &gt; press reg - I'll look - and if so, it's yours.
&gt; -BaH
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; That would rock! I was surprised how expensive they
&gt; are. (Though still cheap
&gt; by more modern vehicle standards.)
&gt;
Huh! I guess I only have the one... I - uh - forgot
that I still use 'em myself! I did look to see if I
had saved an extra though!

Here's what you can do: Carry one of those hose clamp
pliers that ratchet and when you know you're coming to
a long hard climb, clamp the return line about halfway
shut! (I will not be held responsible for any
explosions / fires / Crispy Critters, etc. resulting
from replicating this semi-good / easily stoopid
idea!)

(I once forgot to remove a clamp on the return line.
As in, really, totally forgot! Bus was running a bit
rich and I was doing diagnostics and discovered fuel
pressure somewhere above 100psi. Good thing my hoses
were all new.) -BaH
