Subject: 80 MPH Type 2

Sorry but I just gotta brag about my baby. Yesterday, I did a 2.5 hour
run at 75 to 80 MPH. My secret? (VW purists look away) I have a 2.7
liter aircooled Corvair engine and tranny transplanted in it. The engine
has been slightly modified and should produce about 150 hp. Anyone who
is planning on sinking a couple thousand on a high performance type II
or IV engine (and won't have heartburn putting American hp in their VW)
should seriously consider a Corvair engine / tranny swap. The stock
Corvair engine puts out about 110 hp (1960s defined hp, I don't know
what the difference is). Its so nice to keep up with traffic.

Steve
