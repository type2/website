Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing motor mounts ( metal parts welded to frame )

Sounds good to me since type 4 motor mounts are only bolted to the frame.

 Long story short the PO put a late engine in the 69 Bus I bought and had
 to cut out the motor mount parts that are welded to the frame.  I have
 since acquired the parts and have them reinstalled and tack welded (
 maybe more than tacked ).  I am not convinced I am able to get enough
 new welds since they were originally spot welded to the frame in
 numerous places.  Does anyone see a problem using 2 - 3 grade 8 bolts to
 reinforce the attachment through the frame member?  Would that hold the
 engine up in a failure of the welds which hopefully is unlikely?
