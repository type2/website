Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

Here we go again.

&quot; So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
 day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
 breakdown of the viscosity ?&quot;

do you change your oil every 15k miles?

&quot;After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
 will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
 removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).&gt;&gt;

 If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
 wouldn't turn over---&quot;

OK, .0005&quot;. I was making a point, which you obviously missed.

&gt; Funny thing---
&gt; on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions;


* When was this owners manual ACTUALLY WRITTEN?
which is why I mentioned the FACTORY RECOMMENDATION for lubricants in the
2002 aircooled cars. You can continue to use your dog-eared 1974 glovebox
guide for technical arguments, and ignore the factory UPDATED recommedation
and technical bulletin updates.
