&gt;Hey List:
&gt;I was wondering what the listees out there use for
&gt; a bike rack?

I use a mount that clamps to my tubular roof rack.  The roof rack is a
good location for a couple of reasons:

Less chance of getting the bikes crunched by errant parkers.
Bikes are up in the air, further from sticky fingers.
Bikes don't get as dirty, though the bugs still get stuck onto them.
Plenty of room for loooong recumbent bikes.

Disadvantages:

A stepladder is needed to put the bikes onto the left side of the
rack, unless your name is Kareem.
Driving under low overhangs can be expensive.
