&gt; &gt;Richard: Can you suggest where one can mount the sensor in a 1600
&gt; &gt;engine with a stock exhaust system?
&gt;
&gt; If you had a FI beetle CA exhaust setup you could use the CAT with the bung (the bus uses the same 043 131 701 model CAT).
&gt;
&gt; I don't have any experience with using O2 sensors on T1 engine, so I don't know where's a good place to mount it...anyone?

Well, it can't be closer than two feet to the exhaust port and also can't
be close to the tip of the exhaust.  I'd say that the best place for the
sensor is right in the middle of the muffler, but it might be a bear to
weld a proper bung to the thin sheet metal.
