Subject: re:bypass wiper switch

Ron:
I'd say that you can NOT replace the wiper switch with a rocker switch
and have it operate very satisfactorily. There's a lot in that mechanism
that goes unseen: to park the wipers one of the windings is grounded out
to basically employ dynamic braking to slow down the motor so that it
will stop on the now dead area at the end of the stroke.
I'd guess that wiper switches from dry parts of the country don't get
much wear and junkyard parts might be a pretty good source.
