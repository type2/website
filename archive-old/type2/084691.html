&gt;This method seems rather masochistic.
&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of that rust?

I vote for sandblasting.  I agree that the sandpaper/screwdriver method 
would be masochistic and on top of that, sandblasting will remove *all* of 
the rust while sandpaper will not (doesn't get into the minute crevices of 
rusted metal).
