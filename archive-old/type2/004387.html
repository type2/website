Subject: rate of success removing exhaust studs?

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I was going to just send this to Steve White but figured I'd ask the
rest of you too.
I had been emailing him about using heat to remove broken exhaust
studs.
This is a 2.0L pancake motor that had the 2 exhaust studs on #1
cylinder sheer off at the manifold, leaving about 1 CM sticking out of
the head, nestled between pushrod tubes and cooling fins once I remove
the exhaust pipe.  Archway did the heads about 2 years and 20K miles
ago.

My plan was to heat it up, douse it with penetrating fluid, and
patiently apply pressure, repeating these steps until it comes free.

I've been told by somebody that it'll never happen, saying:

&quot;I have been working on VW's since 1969. I have tried several times to
remove broken studs from heads and have never succeeded. Finally I
gave up trying before I ruined any more heads....The cure now is to
take the whole vehicle to an experienced VW repair man. He will put
the pipe on with a new gasket, and braze the pipe to the broken off
studs with a gas torch and brass rod. It sounds barbaric and it is,
but it works like a charm and lasts the life of the engine.&quot;

Whatcha all think?  Am I likely to succeed with my method, or is this
guy speaking the truth.  I think he know a fair amount about cars, and
claims to be knowledable about VWs too.

I would like to hear success or horror stories, and thoughts on his
idea of brazing the broken stud to the manifold.

Thanks much
