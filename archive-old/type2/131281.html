Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage

My eyes bugged out reading this... And you're SELLING IT?!?!?!?!

Now I'm trying to think of a way to come up with the $$ and ship it to
SoCal.

&lt;ouch&gt; wife just read that and smacked me! LoL

I haven't really had any complaints about power (when it's running that is)
in my 1700 dual carb 73 HiTop. I'm not going to be beating anybody on the
onramp, but it's still acceptable. Now a 2 ltr 914 engine would be SWEET. =D

&gt; As to impeding traffic?  My biggest kick is coming onto the freeway ramp
&gt; near my house at about 55 (due to the sharp curve just before) and
watching
&gt; 8 or 9 cars all move into the fast lane because they see an old VW bus
&gt; coming on in front of them.  But by then I'm shifting into 4th and pushing
&gt; it up past 80 MPH and then into 5th at 85.  Then I get to watch a few of
the
&gt; cars stay in the left lane still expecting to go sailing by, but they
never
&gt; get the chance as I crest 90 before backing off a little bit.  And no,
this
&gt; isn't a daydream.  It's reality with a 5-speed tranny and a fuel injected
&gt; 914 2.0 motor :)
&lt;/snip&gt;
