Subject: &quot;Jaever&quot;

&quot;Jaever&quot; have one of those days, boy?  I had lost some of the &quot;fixins&quot; for
putting the Westy together, so went down island to get some.  WhoHoo!  On my
way home, it is foggy and rainy, and I am so happy to have acquired parts, I
am not paying attention!  A big white Chev van rips past me, then his brake
lights come on, and there is a RCMP pointing &quot;us&quot; to the shoulder.  I pull
over, and after the van has received his ticket, and moved on, the officer,
comes to my window and says, &quot;hi how are you doing?&quot;  I say fine, and I was
not speeding!  He syas I know that!  I feel relieved and plan to move
away,...but he says, &quot;can I see your license and registration?&quot;  I show!  He
says &quot;good&quot;, but I want to do a walk around and &quot;see&quot; your vehicle.  &quot;Put your
lights on please.&quot;  I say they are on.  He says they are not working!  Try
your horn please, nothing!  And I also notice your left front tire is totally
unsafe!  He gives me a 30 day inspection notice, and if I don't have it done
and checked by &quot;them&quot;, they will pull my plates!  The he says &quot; and thank you
for stopping!!!!&quot;  So as my wife states, you should have fixed &quot;those things&quot;
earlier, the Vw parts, are once again &quot;on the shelf&quot;, while the rest of this
stuff transpires!  Aren't Fridays Great!!
Ps  Fixed 1/3 of the problem, and have installed VW parts!
Sid
