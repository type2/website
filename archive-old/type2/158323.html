Subject: Re: [T2] A Friday Busaru Story (spotop)

The underneath radiator has become quite popular and
is working well for a lot of people. Why not? If I had
the funds, I'd try each of the different setups. As it
is, I'm pretty much broke! I have a couple plans I
have devised for running underneath - my concern is
protecting the radiator from all that sand and small
gravel that gets thrown around down there (and I stay
on surfaced roads!) but this sytem has a great deal of
merit. It also totally disguises the fact that you've
got a water cooled engine, so that gives it even more
merit! -BaH

 I just happened to be under my 75 Westie today
 scavenging, and as it had an 
 ac system, it has the louvered pan between the
 framerails.  Why not use the 
 same radiator but use an ac belly pan and try
 diffrent cfm fans?
