Subject: Re: [T2] Moisture in my oil?

I was very surprised to find my oil in this state, also the 
underside of the oil cap was all frosted over.

A lot of my hoses are cracked and due for replacement, 
that is the 25mm cloth covered rubber hoses. Need one 
for my new rubber elbow as well.

&gt; I had a girlfriend who drove a Subaru that had leaky barrels.  It had
&gt; oil in the water and water in the oil.  We changed oil every 2000
&gt; miles, but otherwise were just waiting for the car to expire.  It went
&gt; five years with foamy brown oil before we gave it away still running
&gt; well.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't say that water won't hurt anything, but it is expected that a
&gt; quantity will find its way into the oil.
