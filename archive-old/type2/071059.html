Hiya Bill, 

I've been living with an Auto-Stick for the past two years and I wouldn't 
trade him for a manual plus the price of a cup of coffee.  I'll p-mail you an 
article I wrote some time ago for another website concerning the care and 
feeding of an AS.  
By the way, (obligatory Bus content) did you know that the intake manifold 
for an AS (mated up to a dual port 1600) is the same as the manifold used on 
a Bus (1600, of course) with vacuum assisted brakes?
And with that, I'm going to skedaddle fearing that this thread may already be 
too long (and out of place).
