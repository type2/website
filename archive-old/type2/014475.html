Hiya All,

The comment included in one of the previous posts on this thread concerning 
money helping to make information more available is right on 
the............er.............money.  Excellent service only if their palms 
are crossed with green.  How much green?  20DM (about $10.00 at current 
exchange rates) will do nicely.  Get a money order in DM and send it 
to...............

Stiftung Automuseum Volkswagen
Diesel Strasse 35
D-38436  Wolfsburg
Germany

Don't waste your time with any internet contacts.  Snail mail is THE way to 
go in this instance.  Be sure to include your VIN along with a nice letter 
(in English) explaining your needs.
Expect a return in approximately 3 weeks.

Good luck,

Mike
