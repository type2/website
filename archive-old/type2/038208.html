Touche.

There is rot in the following areas.

A) Battery tray. Not bad. Repairable.

B) Small hole just behind the front wheels on the passenger side, approx.
2&quot;x2&quot; which I believe is the cover for the frame rail that runs underneath.


That's it for rot. Beam is good, rockers are good. Rear quarters are good.
Bumpers are relatively dent free. Windshield is good, as is the metal
directly underneath. Engine is CLEAN. Engine compartment rust free original
paint with the exception of the battery tray. Front floors have some surface
and one seam that needs repair at the heels of the driver where the floor
meets the rise for the drivers seat. Minor repair, unless you are planning
on making a show car.

Slider works well, but I'm sure would benefit from a cleaning and greasing.

This was a California bus owned by an elderly gentleman and wife. (I know,
sure, sure, and they only drove it to church on Sundays.)
Quite an interesting story on this one. They are the second owners, having
purchased it from California. They spent their winters in Bahamas, so the
bus was not driven in the winter.

As far as I can tell, there is no rot on any of the surface panels. The
paint is chalky. I haven't tried rubbing it out yet.
We shall see how she looks after some light rubbing compound...

Does need a new windshield gasket.

I have done the following,

Changed oil and filter.

New Bosch Plug wires, Plugs.

009 with Pertronix

New engine seal.

Timed.

Gas lines have been replaced recently, but probably need to be replaced
again to be on the safe side.

All lights work except for after-market fog lights.

Cheapo stereo blew a fuse.

Battery relatively new, took a charge, but prior to that sat 6 months and
still turned the engine over for about 20 min. while I futzed with the
engine. 

The back seats are in very good condition, as the middle seat had been
removed and stored. The front seats are unripped original, but need new
covers. The floor mats are both in good shape front and cargo.
Headliner needs to be cleaned, no rips. Not yellow or anything.

There is some dents in the nose, as something backed into it and punctured
the nose just above the passenger headlight. Will require some
straightening, but not too bad.

Has the spare on front setup.

That's it. I will post some pictures on my website this weekend.
