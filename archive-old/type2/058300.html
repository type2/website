Listees,

A couple weeks ago a kid in a 4WD pick up hit the driver side of
my 78 Westy.  The point of impact was almost dead center of the two
_large_ side panels.  I posted a message asking list members
for advice regarding insurance adjusters, body shops, parts 
suppliers, and every other detail I could think of.

Am I the only person on the list who doesn't know that only _some_
body panels are available?  I tried every source I could think of and
no one seems to make the large side panels.

Anyway, my major concern was that the adjuster would total my bus,
offer me an undervalued amount to settle, and then want to keep it for
salvage.  

So far, everything _seems_ to be coming out OK.  I got a check for 
$2300 to cover exterior damage and a note on the bid saying the 
insurance would also pay for a &quot;tear down and repair&quot; of the interior.

This happened after I found a body man in town who said he could
have the necessary parts fabricated locally.  He runs a high volume 
shop, but has a good reputation for quality work.

Just called him up and he wants me to bring it in to have the guy who's
really going to do the work look at it.  Tomorrow.

My fears about adjusters were seemingly unfounded just as list
members suggested.  The insurance won't use junkyard parts just
as list members thought.  I did do a lot of homework and was
armed with Wesy classifieds off the web to prove value of vehicle.

I've felt confident deailing with people who would determine the fate
of my bus because of the great info gained from the list and listees.

Sincere Thanks,

Fred Brittain
78 Westy
