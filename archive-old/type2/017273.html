Subject: The Gangbanger, The Bus and The NutBuster (long)

Just trying to get this in as an early jump on the Friday topics.  I see
that it is 12:11am Friday on our east coast

I was at the junkyard today going through a gaggle of buses just waiting
for the pickins.  There was a '71 that was particularly trashed and I
don't know why, but I had to look.  Sitting in the spare tire dip was
the gangbanger. Actually it was a polaroid, but he was there.  The photo
was taken at night and the massive amounts of graffiti were visible in
the background.  The guy was holding a sawed-off in one hand pointing it
at the camera and a half finished 48 oz bottle of Colt 45 Malt Liquor.
In the foreground was about a dozen polished off bottles of Colt 45 and
a few just waiting to be emptied.

I never thought of a bus as the gangbangers choice for  transportation,
drivebys or just anything at all, but I guess you learn something every
day.

Now on to the Nut Buster.  Its not what you may think.  I found a '77
(8/77) with all its brakes intact.  I was going to get those brakes and
wheels home with me one way or another.  I started off trying to get the
wheels off of the rear hubs.  Fun job with the bus up in the air and the
e-brake useless.  I found a truck with a bunch of 2x4s in the back and
wedged a few and managed to brake the two nuts free, but not before I
broke my 19 mm socket.  Ran out to the car and got the lug wrench and
finished the job.  The first brake housing removal went ok and the other
side was finished in about half the time.  I'm on a roll here, I'm
stacking up my hard earned booty on the cart and I turned my attention
to the front.  I had decided to leave the wheels on and just remove the
spindle and all from the ball joints and just wheel the assemblies
away.  I started taking off the bottom nut and after about one turn, it
froze.  And there was NO moving it in any direction.  I worked it and
worked it and then the ball joint broke loose and just turned as happy
as can be.  Now how the heck am I going to get that nut off.

When ever I get myself in a hole like this, I look around at my
remaining tasks and start working on them.  I quickly removed the nut
from the top ball joint.  Ok, I went to the next wheel.  Off in a
jiffy.  Ok back to that bastard nut.  Worked with vice grips holding the
bottom, no luck.  I sat there thinking and my thoughts turned to my
hacksaw (doesn't everyone bring one of these to the junkyard?)  So a
cutting I start.  Now the angle was such that I had to cut on about a 30
degree angle across the bolt, turning the ball joint as I made
progress.  The movement of the hacksaw was limited to about 1.5&quot; at
best.  I was happy that those nuts weren't case hardened.  After 15
minutes I had made noticeable progress.  I kept going.  45 minutes later
I was through the nut from top to bottom.  I wedged the screwdriver in
there, opened it up a bit and by holding the ball joint with the vice
grips was able to slowly back the nut off.

My vote for nut buster goes to the trusty hacksaw/vicegrips combo.

I went home a with everything I went hunting for.
