Hey All,

This post is certainly of topic, but it is friday and it's something
you should read. It was forwarded to me by a friend and I believe it
to be genuine. The link is for real and takes you to the U.S. House of
Representatives Home page where you can find and e-mail your areas
representative.

&gt; Internet Access Fee? JUST SAY &quot;NO&quot;
&gt; Forwarding the information below for those who may want to respond:
&gt; Congress will be voting in less than two weeks.  CNN stated that the
&gt; New Congress would, in two weeks time, decide to allow or not allow a
&gt; Charge to       your phone bill equal to a Long Distance call EACH
time you access the Internet.
&gt; The address is http://www.house_dot_gov/writerep/
&gt; Visit the address above and fill out the necessary form! Tell your
congressman to vote against Internet Access Fees! If EACH one of us,
forward this message on to others in a hurry, we may be able to
prevent this injustice from happening!
&gt; AND SEND A COPY OF THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY.
