Subject: oil temp gauge???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

      in the coming months of summer, i am kinda worried about my running
temp. I'm tryin to figure out how much is involved in installing an oil
temperature gauge on my van. I'm just concerned with finding out my options
now. Do i have to remove the engine, or can it be done in the car? I also
figured since i was goin through with that, i might get an assortment of
gauges, but dont have all that much to invest. I just want to be safe in
knowing the norms of my engine, and when they arent at the norm. 
      thanks,
