Subject: 82 Westy has sold

     Well, it is a pretty sad day at the Callaghan house.  I sold my westy
today.  I tried to put it off but finances just were not looking any better.
It has gone to a good home.  Someone who will take care of it like I tried
to do.  I will still be lurking about the lists.  I will not be without a
bus for very long.  Thanks for all the help.
