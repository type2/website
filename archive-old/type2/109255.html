&gt; Bus pilots running Type 4 motors who want/need/crave a little bit more
&quot;juice&quot; would do well to optimize the alternator you already have if it's a
55 amp unit, and forget about upgrading to the factory 70 amp unit, UNLESS
you have a complete motor to pirate the goodies from...

Sooo, it _is_ possible to use the stock alternator to support two batteries?
How does one &quot;optimize&quot; an alternator?

I've been looking at upgrading to two batteries from the get-go here, and
wasn't quite sure where to start.
