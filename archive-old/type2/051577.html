&lt;&lt; Why is there a different fuel pump for the 1600 DP depending on whether
 you have an alternator or generator?  Is one interchangeable with the
 other?

I heard that it has something to do with the size of the alternator, so you 
want a fuel pump that fits with the oversize object.

BUt I have an alternator in my 65, and regular fuel pump.

I also have a generator (not alternator) stand, so it may be a stand thing.  

I guess I dunno exactly either.
