Subject: Rear end problems on a 71...

Hey all,

I have a question. I have a 71 bus and while cornering (Hard cornering)
it jutters in the rear end. I know the bus isnt a Porchse or anything
(its more like a billboard.) But is this the bus teling me im pushing it
too hard and is about to flip, is the alignment in the rear end off(about a
year ago I adjusted the torsion bars in the rear), or is it the tires? (I
have what is supposta be the original size tires in the rear)
 Any info would be greatly appreciated...

Thanks
