Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 camshaft interchange?

Hello Guys   I use a paint marker to number the lifters  Then clean them off 
with carb cleaner before installing  also use some  cam lube on the face and 
sides.  The nice thing about the paint is that even if they do get mixed up you 
still know where they go  Later and have fun  mark Dearing
