Subject: Re: [T2] Quick Oil Filter Question

Replace the filter.  Take it back to where you bought it and let them 
know that it's defective. If a standard chain variety FLAPS, there 
shouldn't be any problem. Many will insist that Mann/Mahle are the only 
filters to use.  I Use Purolator One in the Diesel Rabbit flavor.  Has 
the same mounting as the stock filter with about twice the filter media 
in it.
