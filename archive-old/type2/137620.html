&gt; Tried to order a timing scale from B.D. but they are NLA right now.

Doesn't Bus Boys have them?  The last one I bought, I got from the VW 
dealer.  They had them in-stock, even.  (Probably because the same part 
was used on early Vanagons.)

&gt; Also looking for two latches that hold the engine hatch closed. Both 
&gt; of mine
&gt; are broken and need replacement. haven't seen them for sale at any of 
&gt; the
&gt; vendors. I don't know how they got broken. I don't see any pry marks 
&gt; on the
&gt; hatch but the engine mounts were all broken, could the engine moving 
&gt; have
&gt; lifted the hatch enough to break the latches?

I think your best bet is to hit a junkyard for these.
