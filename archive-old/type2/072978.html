Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solex carbs

&gt;How in the world do you put Fuel Injection in a dual carbed beast??

Steve again. He was trying to talk me into putting a 2.0L hydraulic lifters
and FI in my 73 (he did that to a Westy). You replace the whole carb set
up. We'll go junkyarding sometime and I can show you. It looks like a big
spider four-legged sitting on top of the engine (no air cleaner).

But you have to replace the gas tank and firewall tin with an FI version to
re-route the throttle cable. Among other assorted and sundry mods.

So, I'll stick with carbs because I prefer the mechanical to the
electronic. It's easier for me to understand. I haven't broken through the
FI knowledge wall. Everyone who knows it says it's easy, and then there's
the rest of us. :-)
