&gt; I have a coupla extra manifolds.  If you have a DP center section with good
&gt; heat risers, you can buy SP end &quot;castings&quot; (they're not really cast, and the
&gt; fit isn't all that good - AMHIK).

Talk about the worst of both worlds!  No way I'd want to put dual port
seals on a single port conversion.  Those seals are one of my worst
headaches!

Get the proper manifold and be happy!
