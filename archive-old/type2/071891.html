Dear listers,

  I just picked up a pair of rebuilt 1600DP heads and they sure look nice.  
There is just one problem with one of them.  One of the bosses above the exhoust
valve has a crack in it.  I'm assuming it happened when driving in the new valve
guide.  You can see it when you look though the exhaust port.  The crack is wide
enough for me to put a fingernail into it.  It doesn't look like it would ever 
come loose, but?   I remember someone posted a picture of a typeIV head that was
missing most of this part and it seemed to run fine. Is this a common thing or 
should I bring this one back.
