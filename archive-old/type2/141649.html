Hi Richard
We're down in Hobart..  Have a really good mechanic here who manages  
to source most things that we have needed.  He is a flat four lover  
with a great '69 Dual-cab (plus a brand new series 5 GTI Golf-!!) so  
he doesn't mind water-cooled.

Had problems with some odd stuff as the PO was not vaguely interested  
in maintaining the vehicle properly.
While visiting friends in your home town earlier this year I stumbled  
over Mick Motors &amp; picked up a front emblem &amp; sliding door lock grommet.

However, still need some basic things that local mechanic can't  
source including the clips for the front emblem and the beading for  
the sliding door track cover (passenger side &amp; drivers side matching  
cover strip).

Have followed discussions on list re tyres &amp; checked archives but  
still can't make up my mind re what tyres to use.  Currently have  
Bridgestone 185/75 passenger tyres fitted.  Any recommendations?

thanks for the info on FI.  Have never seen an FI Bay.  Don't even  
think my mechanic has seen one down here, but haven't asked him  
specifically.

Anyway, even though we are at the 'Southen' end of the continent,  
it's good to know other Aussies follow the list too


&gt; G'day Tim,
&gt; Good to see a fellow Aussie on the &quot;list&quot; :-)
&gt; Sounds like you have a very nice '76 and doing a great job  
&gt; restoring her.
&gt; Where abouts are you? Which shops do you go to for parts? I may be  
&gt; able to help.
&gt;
&gt; I have a '77 Deluxe micro (2L) which I restored a number of years  
&gt; ago now but still going well.
&gt; FI bus's were definitely sold in Australia. It was vary rare in '74  
&gt; - '75, but from '76 on (when the 2L came out) they became more  
&gt; popular. I don't know numbers, but at a guess ~20% of kombi's were  
&gt; FI. We were lucky though to avoid catalytic converters and a number  
&gt; of other emission related stuff in the Bay kombi's.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Richard
