Subject: torsion arm/bar
Mime-Version: 1.0

so, last night i started to remove the torsion arms from my 75 westy.  the 
bottom left one came off fairly easily, but the top one still had tension 
on it downward.  so, i checked out the type2 library and figured out what 
needs to be done.

anyway, here' the question....

the inside of the torsion arm is keyed to the leaves of the torsion 
bar.  the end of my torsion bar has a bead weld across the end of it.  i am 
assuming this is there to keep the leaves together, so that they will fit 
back in to the bar properly.  well, the bead was broken off of 3 of the 
leaves on one side.

is this going to be a PITA to get back in?  do i need to get another 
torsion arm?

argh is becoming my middle name and soon to be my first.  i exclaimed to my 
boyfriend last night...&quot;why can't just ONE thing go smoothly with the resto 
of my bus?&quot;  his reply, &quot;well, then we would be breaking a trend.&quot;

thanks volks!
