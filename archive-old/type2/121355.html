Subject: lifter bleed down

All this talk about lifters has me wondering why, when one of my lifters 
bled down, no amount of driving or idling or revving would pump it back 
up.  As a matter of fact, the warmer the engine got, the more the engine 
started popping as if it was backfiring back up through the intake.  That 
noise did not dissappear until I removed and bled the lifter.  Is that the 
sign of a more serious (or different) problem?  Greg
