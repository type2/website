Subject: ARGGG!  Screw Fell in Engine

I was changing my spark plugs when my brother jumped into the bus and a
small aluminum screw fell into the spark plug hole on the number 1
cylinder.  This is a 73 bus.  I can't seem to get is out of there.  Is
there any way to get it out without removing the whole engine to get the
cylinder head off?  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  
BTW:
Thanks to all the help I got from the list on the overflowing carb
trouble.  It was just a stuck float.  I had the retaining spring in upside
down which restricted the float travel.
