&gt; I am getting ready to redo my back brakes and have a question.   As I am
price
&gt; comparing I found
&gt;
&gt; Bus Depot offers hand brake cables for late 71-79 bus for 9.95  the length
of
&gt; this is 2966MM
&gt; RMMW offers hand brake cables for 72-79 bus for 12.95 the length of this
is
&gt; 2960 MM
&gt;
&gt; Which would be correct?  I know they both can't be right.

The VW parts fische doesn't list one for 2966mm..... not sure where that #
came from.....

From 218 104 708 [68] to 211 2300 000 [late? 71] is part # 211 609 701P and
it is 3435mm long.

From 212 2000 001 [72] to end of 79 is part # 211 609 701T and it is 2960mm
long.


&gt; Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during the 73
model
&gt; year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is 233 210
0455.  I
&gt; have read several accounts of VW going back and forth around the chassis
&gt; number switch to get rid of parts so..... Does any one know how to tell
the
&gt; difference in the two different shoes?

Can't help on the shoes.....VW no longer lists them as shoe w/lining. They
only show lining material only [and rivets]. From 211 2000 001 [late?71] to
79 it is all the same size= 250 x 55 x 6,0mm.
The only real difference that I can think of is about that time, VW stopped
using the springs and pins to hold the middle of the shoe against the
backing plate.
