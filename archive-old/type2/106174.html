&gt; Thanks, Richard.  Looks like the swivel seats won't fit my bay.  I think
&gt; that the rails for my original seats are welded to the pedestal.  It looks
&gt; like the swivel seats have their rails on the swivel mech, and that the
&gt; swivel mech bolts to the pedestal.

This unique base for the passenger seat is just one of the differences that
makes the camper body style different from the others.
