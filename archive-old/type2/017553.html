&gt; &gt; Sorry, diesel fuel will NOT dissolve varnished gasoline. Lacquer

&gt; MEK,
&gt; &gt; Toluol, etc.
&gt; &gt; Disposal of the dregs is an evironmental nightmare. I'd be tempted to
&gt; &gt; pour in a couple of gallons of new gas (gasohol would be MUCH better),
&gt; &gt; maybe a gallon of methanol, and just drive it away! Next best idea is:
&gt; &gt; remove tank, slosh it around with solvent in it, pour it out on sand
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; gravel drive, get the tank a long way away, light it with a match.
&gt; &gt; WHOOMP!! (if it's volatile) At least this keeps it out of streams and
&gt; &gt; rivers.
&gt; 
&gt; Not quite.  Some of what you pour on the ground will soak in before it
&gt; burns, which eventually gets to groundwater.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're going to burn flammable liquids it's better to do it in a
&gt; metal container open at the top, such as a coffee can.  Be sure to put
&gt; the can in the open, a long way from flammables, and light it from afar.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't generally like to do this, but sometimes the hazardous waste
&gt; disposal regs are a Catch-22.

Open metal container- much better than burning it on soil, I'd agree,
and sandy soil would be the worst for groundwater contamination.
I do understand the concept, but I said the wrong thing. 
I'm actually not keen on urging folks to burn it at all, but that may
sometimes be the best of several unsavory choices.
I've got a better system than most: just feed it diluted to my vw
diesel; VW says 25% gasoline is okay at 0F and below; 4 year old gas is
quite a bit less volatile than new, it would probably be okay at 10-15%
at any temperature.
