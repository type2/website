Subject: *Closer to Brakes*

First, thanks for all the help on trouble shooting thru my brake problem everyone.  Wow, I learn a lot reading thru these threads.
 
I pulled the bus under the carport yesterday, jacked her up, inspected &amp; rotated the wheels.  True to the advise of this list, leakage on the front right hub caused by a leaking wheel cylinder.  Im off to purchase (1) front right wheel cylinder, (1) front set of brake pads &amp; brake fluid for the replacement.  Anything else that I need to consider?  
 
Im still reading up on bleeding the lines.  Well, Im reading anything about a brake job on a type 2 actually. This will be my first experience at doing the brakes on a VW so all advice will be used.  In the past I've let the VW shop do the brake job on my super but now I think its time to become a true VW bus owner &amp; start doing the work myself.
 
Thanks again everyone, especially David! 
Your kindness is appreciated.
