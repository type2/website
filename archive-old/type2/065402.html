&gt;Hello to all who are listening,
&gt;Once again I have come upon something troublesome and I
&gt;am greatful to have the collective wisdom of this list
&gt;available. My problem is this. I attempted to adjust my
&gt;valves tonight. I lined up the rotor with the notch in
&gt;the distributer. I also lined up the notch in my pully
&gt;with the seam in my fan housing (This is a T4).
&gt;I then proceeded to loosen my intake and exaust valves
&gt;on the #1 cylinder. The exaust came loose ok but the intake
&gt;side has a problem. I can completely remove the adjuster and the
&gt;valve still sits on the rocker arm. What does this mean?
&gt;Is my head trash? Thanks to all

Chip, I hope that the advice you have been receiving about the 
location of the pully mark at TDC on the cylinder solves your 
problem.  It seems to me that one way to verify this sould be to 
look at the positions of the rockers and the valve stems:  if the 
intake valve is sitting on the rocker arm, but the rocker arm is 
being held in the &quot;open&quot; position, then it is a sure bet that you 
are not on TDC (assuming that the push rods are the right length, 
etc.)

However if the rocker arms are in the right place, and the valve 
stem is still hitting the arm, then you might have what a dropped 
valve seat.  Several on the list were correctly able to diagnose 
this problem for my '75 (though some thought that the valve stem 
may have been stretched).  For by bus, this also caused gasoline to 
blow back into the air cleaner area.  When I took the heads off, 
the valve seat was rattling around with some .060 inch clearance!  
The engine is still down;  I'll swap heads with another non-working 
engine &quot;real soon now,&quot; and send the head in to be rebuilt.

Good luck with your '74!
