OK, panelists!  VW Tent Page Viewer Chris Desilvis 
(cadesilv_at_sunset.backbone.olemiss_dot_edu) submits this stumper:

&gt; What I really
&gt; need to know is the authenticity of a tent I am about to purchase.
&gt; It is from the early seventies and It will be for my 69 day camper. 
&gt; The tent looks like it is constructed exactly like the other westy
&gt; tents that I have seen but there is only one little problem.  It is
&gt; grey and the window screens and accents are teal/green color. Have
&gt; you ever seen this before? Is it authentic?

Well, panel?  I'm at a loss.  Grey tent with green screens/accents 
doesn't ring a bell, and Chris has carefully perused the Tent Pages 
por nada.

Most plausible explanation receives an NOS breadloaf safari kit! 
(razor blade, pipe strapping, &amp; duct tape)

But seriously - can anyone help?  Mr. DeSilvis feels the NEED for 
CANVAS.  Present owner is IMPATIENT with his finickiness.
