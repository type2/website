Subject: Re: [T2] new beetle

&gt; The housings tend to stick if they  have never been out before and you have to
&gt; be careful as there is a lot of  plastic in there . going back is as they say
&gt; the reverse of the remove.   There are line up postss that you need to get
&gt; right on putting it back in   later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import

ill designed cam mechanism to cooperate. both going in and coming out.
