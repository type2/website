In my 79 conversion - I have a switch that has an A, B and both settings. Is
this a relay an isolator or something different? I assume that both
batteries are charging when the switch is in the both position - is this an
erroneous assumption? Also after reading Becketts Tome and some other
articles in the archive I wonder if one of these batteries should be a
regular one and the other a deep cycle. The PO had two deep cycle - I think
they were the original and I just replaced one of them and will replace the
other this summer - should I buy a regular battery or another marine??
