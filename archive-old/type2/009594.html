I am going to try something like what you suggest below. There are a
variety of asphalt/rubber emulsions and I think that some mixture of them
ought to work. I am going to be experimenting per Bulley's protocols, so
if you can wait, I'll get back to you in a month or so with the results.

&gt; Would getting a flat, shallow metal tray, lining it with aluminium foil
&gt; (a bit thicker than cooking foil), laying some old canvas or denim on
&gt; the foil and impregnating it with asphalt emulsion produce a similar, if
&gt; not necessarily perfect, result?  I haven't handled asphalt emulsion so
&gt; I'm not sure if this would work or could be made to work.
