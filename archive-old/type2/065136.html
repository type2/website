How about the episode where Mr Burns hits Bart with his car?  When Mr 
Burns recounts the story to  the court, he is shown driving a bug with 
flowers painted all over it.  I suppose this was supposed to show he was 
&quot;peaceful&quot;.  I believe he said something like : Give him a nickle and 
lets get going!&quot;

&gt; Speaking of TV shows containing VW's a few episodes of the Simpson's (my
&gt; favorite show) show VW's (or artists renderings of VWs) usually in very
&gt; stereotypical situations.  The episode that always sticks out in my mind
&gt; is the one where Homer's meets his long lost mother.  At the end she
&gt; leaves on a electric powered bus.  I also believe that in the episode were
&gt; Bart and Lisa go to Camp Krusty they show a Bug.  School ends for the summer,
&gt; all the gets run out excited and a group of them rock/tip over a Bug.
&gt; Just some observations,
