Subject: Re: [T2] T3 Engine in a bus??

Hello All    I have done this change over a couple of times. I leave the type 
3 motor intact mount a dipstick adapter and fab the motor bar by combining 
the type 3 and type 4 together. I have used the cheap route on sealing using 
an old truck inner tube screwed around the motor and engine compartment. not 
the best but hey cheap. Motor worked real well. Later and yhave fun  Mark
