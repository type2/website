&gt; Yay! It's running! Troy just called me and held the phone up becasue I
&gt; didn't believe him. Heh.
&gt;  I'm going to head over straight from work to help set the dwell

&gt; Then hopefully Greg will be on the road for North Carolina!
&gt;  There's also a thread over on The Samba with some discussion if  
&gt; you want to
&gt; see it all: http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=135286
&gt;  Thanks for everybody's support!

Just read the Samba thread.  I'd like to say a great big &quot;THANK YOU!&quot;  
to everyone who has worked so hard to help Greg out... especially  
Troy and Don...

I may be in Denver over the Christmas holiday ... If I do make it out  
there, I think a test of just how much beer you guys can drink will  
be in order.
