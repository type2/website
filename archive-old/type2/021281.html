Tell him to go see the ORIGINAL guru of VOLKSWAGEN's first internet
bulletin board, Franklyn Tyler, aka &quot;Mr Bubblehead&quot;, on Bailey Hill Road
in Eugene Or.  Had a parts business when I visited him in '95.   Had a 
bunch of busses and the biggest collection of vw toy's I've seen.  He
used to offer help on Prodigy's Volkswagen subject area in the auto
BB's.  Around 1992-3 as I recall?
