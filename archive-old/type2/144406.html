Subject: RE: [T2] Zbed rebuild

&gt; Has any one changed the foam in thier beds?

I did.  It was a surprisingly straightforwards task.  This is how I did it
on my '78; your bus may vary.

0) locate a local source of foam.  Maybe contact an upholsterer to learn
their sources.  It was easy for me because there's actually a custom foam
place just down the block from me in Seattle.
1) remove the seats.  This is easy but slightly cumbersome as some of the
screws are a bit awkward to get at.  There are 16 screws to remove total.
2) remove the staples.  I just used a slender flathead screwdriver.  Easy
but tedious.
3) Remove the upholstery fabric.  Hand wash and hang to dry.  Also do any
needed repairs.
4) Measure the foam block.  It's easier to do this while it's still
attached, since removing the foam may tear the block.
5) remove the foam from the wood backing.  It's held on by glue, it should
just peel off.  Discard.
6) bring the measurements to the foam store and have them cut the block.
Make sure you get a good firm foam that will hold up for many years.  It's
worth it to spend the extra bucks and have a great bed for the next 25
years.
7) Glue the new foam onto the wood back
8) Staple the upholstery onto the wood backing.  I used stainless steel
staples, so they wouldn't rust.
9) reinstall the seat back onto the hinge.  Done!

It's also generally a good time to replace the foam in the back portion of
the bed, as well as the upper beds if needed.  We did the whole thing and
all the foam cost us about $100.  It's a lot more comfortable now.  :)
