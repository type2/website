&gt; Hi George,
&gt;
&gt; yes the units given are wrong but both your answer and the original
answer are wrong.
&gt;
&gt; the stopping time is not given by dividing the distance by the
deceleration nor by dividing the velocity by the deceleration.

I'll respectfully disagree.  The stopping time is given by dividing the
inital velocity by the deceleration:

V=Vo+at  (where V is final velocity, Vo is initial velocity, a is
acceleration, and t is time.

The final velocity is zero:

0=Vo+at

we're working with deceleration, so a is negative

0=Vo+at

rearranging:

Vo=at

t=Vo/a

Plugging in the numbers:

t=88/23

t=3.8s

This is assuming a constant deceleration.

&gt; Basic newtonian laws of motion  (rendered into a mathematical form) state
&gt;
&gt; S=ut   ft**2/2
&gt;
&gt; where s is distance, u is intitial velocity, f is the acceleration, and t is the time
&gt;
&gt; so given that 60mph = 88feet per second
&gt;
&gt; 167 = 88t - 23t**2/2
&gt;
&gt; solving the resulting quadratic (11.5t**2 - 88t   167 = 0) gives (approximately)
&gt;
&gt; t = -0.8 or 8.5
&gt;
&gt; -0.8 may be discounted as an unreal answer giving a stopping time of 8.5 seconds

Your equation also assumes a constant acceleration, but you are using
the stopping distance as your input.  An easier way to do it is to use
average velocity:

s=Vat  Va=V+Vo/2

s=(V+Vo)t/2

167=(0+88)t/2

solving for t gives:

t=3.8s


&gt; But personaly I don't care, I enjoy driving my bus however long it takes to stop. I just know it will not stop on a dime so leave a bigger gap in front of me!

Me too!

George
