Subject: [T2] Wanted: mag rims to  fit a 73 van ?

Any idea what will fit ???

I have a 73 panel and would like to put some kind of mag rim on it.

what size rim will fit under the rear wheelwell with a normal 70s series tire?

either 14inch or 15inch but approx. the same height so it will have the same 
gear ratios

thanks for any advise....  or if you have something for sale please email me 
directly
