Subject: Re: Brand new German VW 2.0 liter engines F/S

Hey all,

Anybody else taking advantage of this?  I haven't seen a zero mile german
2.0 liter engine advertised.  Is this as rare as I think it is?

I wondered, so I called Peter _at_ tiico_dot_com and not only is it for real but
the price is OUTRIGHT (no core or return shipping to mess with).  He told me
they come with new valve covers and are shipped in a genuine VW wood crate
with latches... Sweet!

Only down side is they're on the dock in South Africa so they will take
about 6 weeks to arrive.  That gives me time to organize the work bench and
clean the garage, so its not really a down side at all ; )

Peter was very helpful and said he would sell as many of these to the List
before the remainder go to a wharehouse distributor.  He also has some new
german flywheels on the way for the 2.0 liters.

I ordered 2 of each so they're going fast = )
I'll keep you all posted as things progress.

Later,

78 bus (Julius)
80 Custom Camper (Eve)
82 Westfalia (Daisy)

BTW, he has rebuilds from the South African VW factory  for around $1100 or
so OUTRIGHT. So, whichever you're interested in  you might give him a call.


&gt;These are 2.0 liter engines w/ hydraulic lifters
&gt;new VW German case (carb or fuel injected models)
&gt;new VW German heads (square port)
&gt;new VW German oil cooler
&gt;new VW oil filter
&gt;
&gt;There are only 14 available and I am holding them till early next week
&gt;for the list and then a WD is going to take the rest (if any are
&gt;left) and raise the prices. This has got to be the last of these
&gt;available. Very rare find from one of the VW plants.
&gt;
&gt;The price is $1990.00 plus freight from Calif.
