Subject: Re: starter dead

My starter went out on Tuesday....my bus became harder and harder to start
over the last month or so.

Anyway I had the same situation only I did get the click (otherwise all
seemed well, but nothing happened when I turned the key). Crawl under the
bus and check the wires to the starter and make sure there is nothing loose
and a good connection.

A not too mechanical way to tell is to take a hammer and tap the starter or
solenoid and then see if it starts. This is what I did.

Also if you are careful you may take a screwdriver and touch both terminals
on the starter and it should start if everything else is in order. Please make
sure your bus is in nuetral or Park with the e brake on!

Good luck!!
