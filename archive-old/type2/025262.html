I saw what appeared to be a 71 with a later model pop top. Upon closer
examination I noticed that it was one solid piece with a bumped up area
about 3 inches on the front 2/3rds. A quick glance from the road showed no
interior camping stuff. I am going to go and check it out closer tomorrow.
What could it be?
