&gt; I installed the Hella dual battery kit exactly as per instructions, and it

&gt;  15A fuse attached to the relay was blown. so I replaced it.  Another week, 
&gt;  and it worked fine (I checked it every time I drove it), then again this 
&gt;  weekend, after a five hour drive to New Jersey, fuse is blown.  Blowing 
&gt; fuses 
&gt;  in the engine compartment scares me just a little, so I was wondering if 
&gt;  anyone else has had a similar problem, or might know what I may be doing 
&gt;  wrong.

Hi Don,

Funnily enough I fixed exactly this for a member of our van club this last 
weekend.

This is how he had it wired...
the 2 battery positives were wired to the relay so that they were connected 
when the relay was on. (the switched circuit)
the relay was turned on by the relay being connected to the coil +ve. (the 
switching circuit)
the other side of the switching circuit was connected directly to earth.

And his 15 amp fuse on the side of his hella relay kept blowing all the time

Why? 

When the key was turned and the starter turned the coil was live the switched 
circuit of the relay connected the two batteries together and the starter 
attempted to draw electricity from both batteries at the same time. If both 
batteries have the same cold cranking rating then that 100 to 150 amps from 
each battery and the dear little 15amp fuse just can't take it.

The solution is simple the wire that goes from the relay to earth needs to be 
removed from earth and connected to the wire that comes out of your 
dynamo/alternator regulator and goes to the red 'ignition warning' light on 
the dash.

Then although the wire from the coil attempts to switch the relay on during 
cranking the red light on the other end of the switching side of the relay 
prevents this happening. The two batteries are not connected until AFTER the 
starter has cranked up the engine and the fuse doesn't blow every time you 
start the engine.

Good luck
