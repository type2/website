Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler


&gt;I too did not have much luck with the exhaust paint.  I used that umpteen 
&gt;hundred paint by the POR folks.
&gt;


I used the PlastiKote High Heat silver and it stuck for a year on my '70 
Bug's stock muffler, until I sold it.  Perhaps exhaust temps on the type 4 
are higher.  Not sure.  As I mentioned previously though, I beadblasted the 
muffler first.  Maybe there is some sort of galvinic coating on the muffler 
that prevents the paint from sticking.  Did you sand it down really well?  A 
wire brush on a drill works really well. Eastman makes a header coating that 
is supposed to be pretty amazing.  Supposedly you can even paint it on loose 
rust.
