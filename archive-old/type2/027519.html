Hello All!
Well it's nearly two weeks since my Leisel started and I've replaced the 
following: coil, plugs(twice), rotor, distributor, points, condensor, plug 
wires, and distributor cap. Also put in another double relay, and so far all 
Ive succeeded in getting out of the old girl is a backfire or two. I know 
she's out of time, but with this 2000cc FI, how can I set it without having 
it at least running? I love this bus and am not willing to sell out just 
because of these problems since she set for almost one year idle before I 
bought it and the only thing replaced by the PO was the cap and rotor. All 
or any tips will be greatly appreciated.
