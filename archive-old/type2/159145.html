Subject: help with starter relay? (odd, see pics)

http://eucasafari.vendioweb_dot_com/starter/


I knew my starter was going out, and it failed to start again so I went 
to clean the terminals.
I found some odd looking wiring and a relay, that almost looks like a 
lighting relay of some kind.

When I pulled one of the blade off of the relay, it snapped the blade.
Im not sure where I can even find one of these things, let alone if its 
actually a stock item.

Can anyone tell from the pictures referenced above what the heck kind of 
setup this is and how I might go about fixing it?

I have a new starter on the way, perhaps I can get some of this back to 
normal when I do the swap...

thanks for any help, suggestions or misc tomfoolery,

Chris
