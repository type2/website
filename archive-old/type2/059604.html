&gt;adjustments he made. The book says: &quot;tighten till they touch then two turns
&gt;beyond that&quot; is the proper way to adjust the valves with hydraulic lifters.
&gt;My mechanic claims that this is too much preload on the lifters and
&gt;typically tightens them 1/2 to 1 turn beyond touching. The question to the
&gt;List is:
&gt;
&gt;1) is this dangerous? 

No.

&gt;2)What would be the effect of not tightening them 2 turns over the long
&gt;run?

Probably nothing.  It's a subject of debate amongst mechanics.  Personally
I'd rather have too little preload than too much, because the consequences
of bottoming out a lifter (tight valves) are much worse than having all of
your preload go away (noisy rockers).  I would go with your mechanic's
recommendation.
