Someone recently wrote in about having to set his point gap out of spec a
bit in order to set his timing accurately. I might offer this:
My engine is newly rebuilt. I did the whole tune-up for the first time the
other day(except valves-now hydraulic). Plugs are gapped, points set to
.016, and dwell meter reads 40. I start closing the points a little at a
time and end up with a point gap of .007 to get my dwell at 50+/-2. The
point gap is a far cry from what vw, muir etc say it should be, but they
also say to check the dwell before setting the timing.  Perhaps someone
could explain why we must bend the specs a bit to achieve the end result.
Oh, yeah, 77-stock dizzy(et al)-I thought maybe after the rebuild this
phenomena would be resolved, but no...
