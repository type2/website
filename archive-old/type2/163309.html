Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for charcoal filter hoses

The correct hose to use is 12mm ID Breather Hose, fuel and oil resistant.
VW Part Number N 020 374 1, many vendors on the list carry it.  In a quick
fix, 1/2&quot; PCV Hose is acceptable to use as it's oil and fuel resistant and
can be found at any FLAPS.

&gt; Listee's,
&gt; It's time to replace the charcoal filter hoses on my 71. The charcoal
&gt; filter has one hose going to the right side of the fan shroud, one to the
&gt; oil bath air filter and one coming thru the firewall from the gas tank.
&gt; (there is also another hose from the oil filler to the air filter). It looks
&gt; like they are all the same size. The tube on the side of the fan shroud that
&gt; the hose slips over measures .508 in. or about 13mm. What is a source for a
&gt; good quality hose for this application? - especially the hose from the gas
&gt; tank which has to tolerate raw gas fumes.
&gt; Sincere Thanks,
