Subject: RE: [T2] Engine hiccupping

I posted a question about a week ago regarding a problem with a
hiccupping/sputtering engine with my '78 FI bus. I checked all the
electrical connections, which seemed to be ok, and changed the fuel filter.
Seems to have fixed the proble. The idle screw seems to be more responsive
now than it was before also, and I've noticed it only takes a few minutes to
warm up now instead of a solid 5. I haven't done any highway driving since,
but I've driven it enough to be convinced the problem has been resolved.
