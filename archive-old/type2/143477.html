Subject: Shifting problems

       I put spacers in front of the wing nut because it was close to the end 
of threads. The cable moves about an inch 
      Last fall when we got the bus I rebuilt the engine becuase it sat in a 
garage for 14 yaers, went thru flood and the egine was froze tight . I used 
the old pressure and disk because she only had 57K on her and looked in good 
shape. We went on long trips (WI. to Texas) no problems
