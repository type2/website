Subject: [T2] Hazard switch

Looking for some clarification on Bentley's...

&quot;To test turn signal/flasher RELAY - 
with ignition off, connect terminal + or -49 of the relay to terminal 30
of the fuse box&quot;

HUH?  I don't see any numbers on the fusebox.  Is this perhaps one of
the connections for the relay on the bottom of the fusebox?  I'm pretty
sure that the relay is not the prob, but I'd like to be able to test if
the hazard switch replacement doesn't do the job.

Again, my hazard switch inside the dash is in pieces, so I figure that's
the prob...  

Thankee!

Teri
