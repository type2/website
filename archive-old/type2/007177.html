Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank Question

[...]

For those neophytes out there, you should know that welding on a used
gas tank that hasn't been properly cleaned in preparation for welding
is extremely dangerous and can result in severe injury and death.

&gt;One of the things that the FI tank that the non-FI tank does not is 
&gt;a small
&gt;built in sump inside the tank.  This is needed in those tanks if you 
&gt;want to get
&gt;more than 11 gallons out of a 15 gallon tank.
&gt;
&gt;I used a FI tank in my DC.  The supply and return lines were too 
&gt;small for my
&gt;system, so I got some AN parts and welded a supply port just below 
&gt;the sump and
&gt;welded up the old return.  I then welded a new return port on the 
&gt;top of the
&gt;tank and above the sump.  I thought this would be good enough.
&gt;
&gt;I now have an early warning system (very irritating) when the tank 
&gt;gets too low
&gt;and I make a right turn.  In these tanks there is a lot of left to 
&gt;right
&gt;movement of the fuel.  Right turn and all the fuel is over on the 
&gt;left side of
&gt;the tank and away from the intake.  Left turn and you have all the 
&gt;fuel you
&gt;need.
&gt;
&gt;The reason for my welding ports rather than using the stock FI ports 
&gt;is that I
&gt;put a CIS FI system out of a '79 Volvo onto my Type IV motor that's 
&gt;sitting in
&gt;the '60 Double Cab.  The CIS system has a bit higher pressure than 
&gt;the
&gt;L-Jetronic and I wanted good thread on connections rather than press 
&gt;on hoses.
&gt;
&gt;Since you have already cleaned, etched and sealed the existing tank, 
&gt;it sounds
&gt;like your best bet would be to fabricate yourself your own sump and 
&gt;return the
&gt;fuel through one of the vent ports in the top.  That way you don't 
&gt;have to mess
&gt;up the nicely restored tank.
&gt;
&gt;I have heard of marine systems using the T-fitting for the return 
&gt;line, but this
&gt;concerns me (maybe needlessly).  I'll explain why.
&gt;
&gt;In the FI system you have the high pressure supply and lower 
&gt;pressure return.
&gt;Your system pressure is regulated at a set value.  With pressure 
&gt;system, if you
&gt;restrict the return line, the system pressure will go up.  Depending 
&gt;upon the
&gt;design of the FI system, this could either do no harm or cause 
&gt;mixture problems
&gt;like running too rich.
&gt;
&gt;My concern about returning the fuel at the bottom of the tank with a 
&gt;T, is that
&gt;with a full tank of gas, you have that weight of fuel providing 
&gt;resistance to
&gt;the return. As the tank empties, the resistance reduces.  Coming 
&gt;back the top
&gt;and there is no resistance regardless of tank level.  The twin tanks 
&gt;on my Jag,
&gt;both have the return lines at the top of the tank.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps

&gt;&gt; I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system 
&gt;into my
&gt;&gt; 74 loaf. I was able to purchase everything from the donor with 
&gt;exception of
&gt;&gt; the fuel tank. I currently have a non-FI tank that I; cleaned, 
&gt;etched, and
&gt;&gt; polymer coated. I would like to be able to keep this tank, but as 
&gt;read
&gt;&gt; through the archives there seems to be no other optons aside from 
&gt;brazing a
&gt;&gt; fuel return port into my current tank or purchasing a used good 
&gt;used FI
&gt;&gt; tank. I am going to throw out a couple of ideas to the &quot;Bouncing 
&gt;Wall&quot;: #1
&gt;&gt; Could I possibly run the fuel return line to one of the top vent 
&gt;ports on my
&gt;&gt; tank? #2 Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard 
&gt;fuel port
&gt;&gt; on the bottom of the tank? I've tried Miller Fuel Injection 
&gt;(thanks Mark)
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; they offer a sump kit which is a little cost prohibitive at $149.
