Subject: 2.0 Rebuild questions.

Well I split the case and evrything looks in very good shape but I have a 
couple questions. First the lifters slid out of the case on the right side 
and got mixed up is this a huge problem if they are not in order if so what 
do I do. The other thing is when I grab a rocker arm with my hand I can 
wiggle it the least little bit should it be able to move. They all seem to 
move just a little bit. How do I check this.  Last of all I cant really 
figure out what I need to order exactly as far as seals and hardware. Will 
the 2.0 gasket set come with everything i need gasket wise on the whole 
engine. And what about engine studs and bolts should these be replaced. 
Sorry for all the questions but this is my first attemt and I am trying to 
do it to spec.

Casey
