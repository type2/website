Hi George,

I get tickets too when I'm not driving a bus. Got really upset because I let
the ex prod me into hurrying over Thanksgiving weekend and got a ticket
there. Got rid of it through traffic school. Then let myself be hurried by a
friend to run her up to Hoopa and got another one last month, so no traffic
school on this one.

What kind of bug do you drive? I've heard the bug folk say a super handles
better due to the modern suspension, but that the original bug's suspension
is more durable, but is only good for driving in a straight line. What do
you think?

Also had someone bring up a question of whether gas cans stowed on a bus
rear bumper would get too hot from the engine heat. What do you think on
that one?

John

Well, really high performance cars tend to cause me to collect tickets!

Our Scion is pretty good around corners, but I just hate the way that FWD
cars steer.  Heavy and dead.  The shifter is rather notchy too, and just
doesn't have a natural feel.  It drives like an appliance.

When I want a &quot;sporty&quot; drive, I head for the Bug.  Light steering with good
feedback, and shifting that just seems to find the gears by itself. No, I
don't go to the point that things get sideways, but at least I can downshift
the bug effectively.
The VWs just feel as though I am more &quot;connected&quot; with the vehicle.
