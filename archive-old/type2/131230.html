Subject: Re: [T2] My day under my bus (long)

Thanks for the links. Drat, my engine is still a 1700... LoL!

I'd forgotten about the CHT sensor. No sensor, no place for one. I doubt the
PO would put 1700 heads on a 2.0, though it wouldn't surprise me. ;-)

I'm considering taking the HEs to a muffler shop and having them weld pipes
to the head flanges and running the pipes to this muffler here. I'll have
'em put the triangular 76-78 flanges on so it will bolt right up. That may
be the way to go as far as price (and I can get it done Monday and be
running again. Yay!)

Don
