etc, I need to drill out some the screws holding the side popouts into the

the first time and not mess it up anymore than I have to! I have Labeled
ALL my wires and noted the location in my notebook. Which means, A the
labels will fall off and the notebook will disappear come put together
time! Anyway, I ramble. What is the best way to drill out the screws and
then replace them later. I enjoy reading all the rest of the info here!!- - -

if you drill them out it will be very difficult to replace the windows later.
  The screws go through the hinge which is attached to the bus, into the
window frame.   So if you want to reuse them frame, drilling should be a last
resort.
my advice:

1) apply penetrating oil liberally days before you remove the windows

2)  findexactly the right size screw driver.  This is very important.  VERY
IMPORTANT.   The stock screwdrivers that came in the tool kits are the right
size.   the wrong size will nager the screw heads and cause untold woes.

3)  start withe the top screw - it  will be easiest.   Put screw driver in
slot, tap the end with a hammer several times, and lean into it as you
attempt to unscrew it.   CAREFUL!! do not mess up the screw head.  Go back to
tap tapping.  

4) heat can be used if you dont car about the paintwork and have ventilation.
 Burning rubber is smelly.   :(

5)  drill only as much as you need, if the above wont work.   If you are
careful, you will be able to put vice grips on the rest of the screwhead
stuck in the frame to get it out.
