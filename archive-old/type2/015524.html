Them suckers are about a pole long. A pole=a perch. A perch = 16.5 feet.
Now, if you ever catch a perch 16.5 feet long, all I want to know is where
you catch it and what you were using for bait. Just remember, a perch is
not a sucker. If you see a 16.5 foot sucker, get the hell outta the water,
and on the opposite side of the river from the nucleur power plant outflow.
