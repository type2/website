Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 camshaft interchange?

Hi Volks,

An egg carton works great for this... it already has 12 pockets in it, 
and you can use a pen or marker to write notes about what came from 
where on the inside lid of the carton.

Happy trails,

&gt; I agree with Adam P but would add that is important not only to match

&gt; and intake or exhaust.
