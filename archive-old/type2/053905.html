Subject: Is it really this easy?

Okay, so I'm finally getting around to actually installing everything on
my new AVP 2L.  Both the new and old engine have been sitting around for
a couple of weeks, so rushing certainly isn't a factor here.  Memory's
another story (I've been taking good notes, though).

But I'm still freaked out.  I just removed the fan hub, the clutch and
flywheel, and I've tapped a hole for the VDO CHT sender (the hole had
been filled on my new engine.  I've never done any of these things
before, but everything has gone smoothly.

Perhaps too smoothly.

I keep wondering if I'm really just building a big bomb that's going to
blow up my bus the second I hook it up to the ignition.  I mean, I've
been following Wilson, Bentley, Muir, and Haynes (those guys are great)
and everything seems right.... but if it's this easy, why doesn't
everyone work on their bus?

Yeah, yeah, tools, time, workspace... blah blah.  Or maybe I'm missing
something.  I dunno.  Anyway, thanks for letting me decompress.  Time
for a break, then more fun with VW's later.  Mustn't get too cocky.

again...)
