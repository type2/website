Subject: Re: [T2] Pistons pins removal, Any trick!

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;Well, as expected (same on my other engine) all pistons pins are somewhat stuck, they turn freely in the piston and in the rod bushing but they won't come out easily pass the C-Ring. The one my my other engine were a pain in the but to remove, i had to bang those one very hard, i don't want to do the same with the one in my working engine.

Sigh.
There is nothing on a typeIV that requires banging - please don't do it.

Use a large (12-inch or longer) C-clamp with a piece of wood and an appropriately-sized deep socket to press out the pin.  The piece of wood is for the end of the clamp that sits on the piston, so as to not scratch it and also provide grip.
