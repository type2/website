Subject: Re: [T2] steering box

The guy that did the torsion arms says he's sure its the box.  He  would have checked the drag link, etc.  And I found a great deal  on one on Ebarf.  $75 from a Volkswagen mechanic that swears its  good and tight.  So we'll see.  Wish me luck.   Cheers....KR

&gt;  Well, I had the new torsion arms installed but I still have a slight  pop on right turn. I know my steering box is history. Steering has been  loose for a while. I'm a bit finacially embarrased right now as I'm  between jobs and I just spent a wad on the arms, clutch, and a few  other things. Does anyone have a used one that might get me by for a  while? And will it just unbolt from the bottom? If so, I'll put it on  myself. I don't have much of a place and few tools to do anything  serious. Thanks....KR

Don't give up on the steering box until you check the drag link and swing
lever.  I was convinced that my steering box was toast and it turned out
that the drag ling rod end was bad.  Pop, clunk. Pop, clunk...
