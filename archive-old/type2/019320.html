Subject: Parts Needed

Volks:

In order to satiate my Dr. Jekyl Frankenstein alternate personality
(which is one of many) and to prevent entirely wasting an expensive
education I'm undertaking a fuel injection project on my 71 Westy.  I
need the following:  

FI manifold ends from 75-78 b*g (these have the injector bosses and are
steel)

Manifold Center Section for a Webber progressive carb.

I do have a few parts to trade such as a few carbs, etc. but you
probably dont need anything I have.  I've heard these should be easy to
find at a swap meet but we only swap cousins at the swap meets here in
the Deep South :-).

Any help is much appreciated.

thanks
Shawn Clark
71 Westy
