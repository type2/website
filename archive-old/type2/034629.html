Subject: Indicator removal

Hi list,

Firstly, being new to the list I'll say 'hello' from Spain. I have a 73
westy which is currently laid up due to some nasty rust which we are in the
process of clearing up. So at the moment I am trying to clear the dash and
front panel in anticipation of a new panel. However, this is my first foray
into not only VW work but also general metal work:0)   Having loadsa fun
but also a few problems. My current conundrum is how to remove the
indicators. It seems that they are held in by a pair of rivets.
	Should I drill the rivets out to remove the indicators? If I do, how will
I replace them later? If I don't drill them out do I need David
Copperfield's help? Hmm.
	
	Also, the wiring for the headlamps seems a similar problem. The wires feed
into the black 'U-shaped' plastic holder right? Well to pull the wires
through into the van, do I cut them and buy replacement plastic connectors
or what? I've looked in various catalogues and I dont seem them listed.
Another hmmm.

Thats all for now, 
TIA

Darren
