Subject: RE: [T2] Was: Being Sued by VWoA

Speaking to some other people, it sounds like Continental is just trying to
score easy money by using scare tactics on people. I haven't heard from
anyone that Continental has does anything more than sent threatening letters
to people. Anything more than a letter would probably constitute more time
and money than they care to invest. Sad thing is, I bet they've made quite a
bit of money from this operation.
