&gt; A friend is having problems with the automatic transmission on his 1972 Westy.
&gt; (Transmission slips on upshifts).
&gt; He has had a qualified mechanic open the tranny and he is now looking for
&gt; parts. (Shims, thrust washers etc). Hoping that someone on the list may know
&gt; of a parts supplier or have a good used Automatic. Thanks.

tell him to try to find the later model tranny, it is a better tranny and
parts are still readily avaliable
