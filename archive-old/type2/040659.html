Subject: My fuel line replacement story - read it all or skip to the end

Last week I replaced my entire line with a steel brake line.  There's a very
short piece of 5mm cloth over rubber line between the elbow out of the tank,
then the brake line snakes it's way along the bottom of the body pan,
through the two stabilizing tabs, through the fire wall and along engine
deck.  I didn't hard pipe it to the carb because I put an extra fuel filter
in there, and it will make it easier to pull the engine next time.  Not
stock, but practical.  Maybe over kill (the other filter is between the pump
and the carb).  I did put a piece of oversized American standard fuel line
OVER the steel brake/fuel line where it goes through the firewall and is
clipped to the body.  Then I put a hose clamp on either side of the
firewall.  I figure that line is as solid and protected as I can figure out
how to make it.

The cautionary part of the story is (and by the way, THANK YOU to the listee
who suggested the brake line idea.  Excellent.) that my old fuel line, an
American standard one that was just a tiny bit too big, was weeping when I
went under to do the job.

Worse yet, SOMEHOW when I was way inside the engine compartment struggling
to get the rubber sleeve around the steel line through the firewall hole, I
managed to touch something (coil leads?  I still don't know) and sparks
started flying left and right.  So, my hands are soaked in gas, there's a
half full tank inches away, dribbles of gas everywhere, and I'm in the
garage to boot.  I yanked the battery immediately, but it could have been a
disaster.

Safety first, brothers and sisters.  Thanks for the reminder, Isaiah.
