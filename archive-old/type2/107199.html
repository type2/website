Subject: Re: [T2] Reduced power after tune-up

Quick guess: the PO had the thing way advanced at idle so that it sort-of
compensated for the dizzy not advancing.  Hence, when you timed it correctly
at idle, your driving performance sucked.  Solution: get a functional dizzy
and all should be well.  I've had a similar situation, and a new dizzy cured
it perfectly.  Good luck, and happy wrenching!

&gt; &gt; As I read on in my trusty repair manual, it stated that I should check
the
&gt; &gt; timing to make sure that it advanced as I revved the engine, it did not.
&gt; &gt; Does this mean anything?
&gt;
&gt; Yes. it does need to advance.
&gt; At this point it would be good to know what engine and distributor you
&gt; have so you can get effective advice.
