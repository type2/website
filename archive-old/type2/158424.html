Subject: Awesome bus sighting

Hey fellow bus lovers,

While flipping through looking at old photos online about the city where I
moved to, Roanoke VA, I came across this picture:

It is a fabulous picture of a splittie advertising WSLS radio (now WSLS
channel 10 NBC affiliate). The license plate on the bus is dated 1961.

Just wanted to pass it along.  Hopefully Mark Dearing will see it.
