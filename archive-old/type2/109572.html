Subject: [T2] Correct cam gear backlash (mechanics only)


&gt; I'm &quot;restoring&quot; the engine in my 1970 bus which I bought new in Nov 69:
&gt; New SP heads &amp; case (Brazilian), original std std crank, I need a new cam.
I
&gt; am concerned about the backlash on the cam gear which come in different
&gt; sizes (+1, 0. -1, etc). An engine guy told me he fitted 19 cams once to
get
&gt; the correct backlash.
&gt; I don't have access to 19 cams so I wonder if anyone has advice on this?


Try cutting back on your medication, Phil :)
Volkswagen had this same problem, while
attempting to assemble several million of this
type engine. They solved it by accepting a &quot; tolerance &quot; :)
Consider yourself fortunate if you can find a gear
with any numbers on it at all. Back to the Bentley:)
