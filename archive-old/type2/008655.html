Subject: Oil Additives (SLICK 50, etc.,) READ THIS!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

All,

I asked earlier if anyone remembered the URL or web-site name on this
subject. I then searched the archives....no go. I then searched the
'net using MetaCrawler with the words &quot;oil additives&quot;. From this
search, I found what I was looking for....

Before buying that &quot;miracle&quot; additive, check the following
URL....http://www.ll_dot_net/spider/snake.htm or do your own search. 

By the way, the word &quot;snake&quot; in the above URL stands for &quot;snake oil&quot;.

Read it.


Jaime
