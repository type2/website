Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft-siphoning trick

&gt; I keep a CLEAR tube about 6 ft long in the bus for this- tube tends to
&gt; bend around in the tank and suck air- the trick is to feed it in as you
&gt; BLOW through the other end until you hear bubbles-push in further
&gt; (seeing that bubbles still sound-then suck until you see the gas and
&gt; stick your finger over the end and place into receptacle.
