Subject: RE: [T2] Tires  Hankook vs Continental?

&lt;However, they were discussed briefly on
the Vanagon list back in November. Dennis Haynes (a professional Vanagon
mechanic who is quite well regarded on the list) wrote: &quot;This is a common
tire on the Eurovans. My opinion is that they should be outlawed. Horrible
in the rain, prone to belt shifting and tread separation. As for the ride,
remember kiddy bicycles with the solid tires? And don't even think of using
them in snow.&quot;  (As you can see, Dennis doesn't mince words. :-)  Of course
the Conti sold in Canada may not be the Vanco-8. Might be worth checking.&gt;

I wish I'd seen Dennis' comments before I bought mine.  The Vanco-8s were getting some good press on this list, so thinking I was getting a quality tire, I replaced my ancient Michelins with them last November.  I don't mind the ride so much, but the traction in mud or snow is abysmal, truly pathetic.  I'd stay away from Conti's.
