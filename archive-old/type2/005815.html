Subject: Re: [T2] 75 westy table

[...]

Gowesty is wrong! That table they picture is for 76 to 69, NOT 74/75.

74/75 mounts to the wall, is wood grain, has a swing out leg, and the leaf
slides out. [almost the same as 68 to 73, but they were white or white w/faint
black lines and no leaf]


&gt; hey rich.
