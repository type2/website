Subject: Valve covers

Hi all i have just finished installing new pushrod tube seals in my 74
sportsmobile.  The thing is that i can't get the valve covers to stop
leaking.  I am using rubber gaskets with blue RTV silicone to seal it. 
They don't leak when the engine is off only when it is running butit leaks
a lot.  Please help
