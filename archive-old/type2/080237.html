&gt;
&gt;As a footnote, I've heard criticisms of Bondo, sometimes by persons
&gt;commending Mar Glass.  I had always used a product called Evercoat, but I
&gt;decided to try the Mar Glass since the recommendation was strong.  It's a
&gt;very nice product, better than Evercoat.  The other day I read the small
&gt;print on the Mar Glass can and saw that the manufacturer is Bondo corp., so
&gt;maybe Bondo is ok now, I dunno.  Bondo (and its generic relatives) is like
&gt;beer and patriotism-- it's great when used appropriately, hazardous when
&gt;abused.

Instead of Bondo which soaks up moisture and leads to rust - - - get a 
gallon of metal impregnated filler.

The brand name I have used is &quot;Metal to Metal&quot;. It is a bondo like material 
full of ground up aluminum. It is waterproof and much harder stuff. We have 
used it to seal Swiss cheese floors with good results. (Structurally it was 
solid with many little holes, full frame car).
