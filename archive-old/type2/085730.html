Subject: Westy Upholstery

Hello Bus People,
Can anyone recommend any reasonably priced auto upholstery
shops in the San Diego County or Tijuana area.  I was
going to try this myself, but now I think I'll get
estimates from a pro. Both of my front seats and the
rear folding z-bed are shredded.  Thanks for any input.

Tom Riis
70 Westy
