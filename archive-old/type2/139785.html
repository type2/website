&gt; &gt; in a world without walls, who needs &quot;Windoze or Gates&quot;
&gt; &gt; my bus runs on VW proprietary hardware (ECU) and laptop in bus runs Linux
&gt;
&gt; I'm still rabidly anti- MS/Windoze/Gates from my Atari days, but have
&gt; since been captured and held my WinXP in my Athlon &quot;Tower&quot;. Since it's
&gt; Friday maybe some of you have suggestions how I can be &quot;rescued&quot; and
&gt; get into Linux. (Bus content: I need my computer to access Type2_dot_com!)

I'm obviously accessing the list with my computer, I'm running Red Hat 9
and using Mozilla or Pine to read my mail.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of years ago a friend sent me a couple of Linux
&gt; distributions, neither of which would work. Now I purchased
&gt; Lindows/Linspire 4.5, but it is unstable too. Linspire customer
&gt; support been working with me a over a month now. Don't know if we are
&gt; getting anywhere...

I would recommend Fedora Core 2 to a beginner, or the K12LTSP version
which is much more versitile but a little more complicated,  an easy way
to get started is to use Mozilla or Firefox for internet and
OpenOffice_dot_org for you word processing in windoze to make the easy
transition.

and we should probably take this off list as we are pushing even the
Friday limits..  but for bus content, I couldn't keep my bus running
without my linux computer getting me access to this list....

Bob
