Subject: RE:1980 Vanagon air seal

&gt;I'm Looking for a 2&quot; peace of the air seal that goes around the engine
&gt;tin on my 80 Vanagon. My exsisting seal is in great shape but there is a
&gt;small gap at the front of the engine. It probably doesn't have a large
&gt;effect on cooling but it bothers me. If anyone has there old seal they
&gt;replaced and it still has an inch or three that's still in good shape, I
&gt;am interested. This is not the foam seal the bay window busses use, It's
&gt;the rubbery one that clips on the tin.


If by 'front' you mean the side towards the front of the van, I have an 81
AC with maybe a 2&quot;  gap in the seal right there, and have been told on the
vanagon list that they are all like that. I see it and wonder why, but
they told me that a brand new seal will still have the gap &lt;shrug&gt;

If find out I am wrong, I would like to know about it :-)

Thanks,

John
