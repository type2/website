&gt;On a slightly different subject... are those factory-installed

Yep. We plebes in the states only got seatbelts rated for pickup trucks it seems. I've seen a lot of photos of those belts but never one of the reel. I'm really curious because many late busses had no bulkheads.

&gt;Also, it seems as if they use the same swivel-loop 
&gt;at the top as the Vanagon used, with a stand-off to get it past the lip 
&gt;on the door post (which is what I did, but some people sent me mail 
&gt;concerned about the torque placed on the bolt that holds the swivel.  I 
&gt;ended up leaving the stand-off in place, rather than cutting the lip on 
&gt;the door post).

Aren't folks worry worts sometimes. I'm using the standoff and feel safe.
