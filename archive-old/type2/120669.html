Subject: [T2] Balancing wide 5's.

You said first they balance them off the vehicle? That's the problem with wide 5's, you can't do that unless someone has an extremely rare adapter that maybe 1 in 1000 tires guys may mythically have. When you actually look for someone it is a real Easter egg hunt. Most wide 5 guys are driving around with unbalanced tires- just look at their Buses/Bugs.
 Last summer at a VW event, I went around and asked every person there if they had any ideas, the best suggestion I got was to do what I ended up doing-buying an old front drum to use as a custom adapter tool.

  &lt; anyhow the on the vehicle balancing went like this.  the tires and wheels were balanced then they were installed on the van.  then the wheels were
&gt; rotated on the van, this detects the out of balance drum or rotor.
