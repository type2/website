&gt; One more thing...
&gt; Make SURE that you get the correct brake pads.  The calipers and brake pads and rotors are
&gt; 71-72 bus ONLY.  Bring your old pads in a and compare if you must.  Some places will try
&gt; and sell you the wrong pad ... BTDT.

As I recall, the only difference between the old and new brake pads is the
lining thickness.  The shape, I think, is the same.

Since the old pads will be thin, comparison won't be very helpful!

The early pads were 10mm thick (.40 in) new
The late pads were 14mm thick (.55 in) new
