Subject: Electrical FIRE!

Please forgive the length here - but we had a serious
problem today with the '62 Deluxe we bought over the
Summer.

We need some (perhaps lots) of advice. We just replaced
the battery (using an 8 volt battery, as that was what was
in there and b/c people suggested we stick with it in
response to a question we posted about two weeks ago.)
Before installing the battery, I did a bunch of tune up 
type stuff (new plugs, points, condensr, cap, rotor, plug wires, 
coil etc) b/c it had been getting tough to start. We thought 
the starting problems, combined with the age of the battery, 
is what caused the battery to stop working.  It wouldn't take 
a charge, so we bought a new one.

OK - so that part went fine.  After installing the new
battery and doing the tune up, I was able to get the bus started 
easily enough. We went back the next day (today) to drive it up to 
where we live to do some more work on it.  After warming it up
for a few minutes while we packed up tools, supplies etc.,
we headed off down the road.  We only made it about 100 
feet when the bus stalled and then would not turn over
(not even try to), and we had no brakes whatsoever 
(straight to the floor, no resistance at all).  I thought
I saw smoke near the right rear, so I got out to investigate.

We had a fire! (where there's smoke....)

It was not in the engine compartment (something to be
thankful for on Thanksgiving!), but was next to and above
the right rear wheel.  The hard brake line for that
wheel was glowing bright red, and the flames seemed to
be from materials in the general area.  The little
fire extinguisher I had in the bus turned out to be almost
completely useless - one squirt and it was gone - should
have known I guess.  We were near an apartment complex
so I had to go in there and break the glass to get a
bigger fire extinguisher which put it out fine. Good
thing.

OK - so now I've done some investigating (not that much,
but some).  It is hard to separate cause from effect, but
the two main parts damaged are the positive battery cable
(leading to the starter) and the flexible brake line.  The
brake line is broken, separated from its metal connector
at the end.  The battery cable has about 12-16 inches of
insulation completely missing.  Obviously, the battery
cable is more likely the cause here - it must have
overheated, shorted out or something and caused the
heat buildup and fire.  But why?

I should mention that when I took the old 8 volt battery
out, I noted that the negative cable was somewhat warm,
which I'm not used to, but I didn't think all that much
about it.  When I disconnected the new battery after
the fire, the negative cable was again rather warm (and
it had not been near the flames).  Is this normal?  Or
does it suggest that there was a short or some fault in the
circuit even before we put the new battery in (and then
the new battery having a better charge overheated things
to the point where the fire developed)? If not - could
the new battery have had a fault that caused the fire 
somehow?

We can replace the brake line and the battery cable easily 
enough - but how do we determine what caused the problem?  
We would appreciate any sugestions anyone might have
as to how we might determine what caused the fire, as
we'd like to avoid having any more!

Thanks in advance.

Brian and Stephanie
