Subject: [T2] heater box repair

dear list
both heater boxes from my 77 bus have small holes in them.  i was wondering 
whether i can repair these or if i need to scrap them altogether.  i was 
going to use por15 to restore the boxes and was wondering what else i should 
use if there salvagable.

thanks in advance
