&gt; I wanted to get some advice about driving in the snow.
&gt; I don't know what anyone else could tell me about driving in the snow, 
&gt; but if you think of anything......

i concur with the &quot;go to a parking lot that's covered in snow and 
practice&quot; -- it worked well for me.  same thing with if you can find
a new road where they're building houses but no one lives on yet,
and just drive around on it before it gets plowed.  Just remember 
to take it easy and not freak-out/make any sudden moves.  If you 
turn the wheel too far -- say when you're trying to swerve to miss
a stopped car -- it won't catch and you'll just keep sliding in the
direction you were going, instead, turn it just a little bit until
you feel the wheels start to catch, then turn it more.  (you'll know
the wheels have caught because the care will start going in the direction
you turned the wheel instead of just sliding forward).  Don't brake too hard,
if you need to slow down, just take your foot off the gas and let the gears
and friction slow you down.  you'll find that the wheels will catch 
easier/faster as the car slows down.

above all, i guess, be aware.  If you're driving well, it doesn't mean
that some other idiot isn't driving their SUV like a maniac just
because they have 4wd.  keep your eyes open for oncoming traffic
*and* folks behind you who are going too fast and perhaps won't be able to 
stop...you can always hit the gas if an accident looks imminent.  this
isn't to say that if an oncoming car swerves into your lane, you should 
swerve off the road.  first thing is to slow down by getting off the
gas and perhaps pumping the brakes.  As above, the slower you're going, 
the more manouverable you are and the better you can react.  If the oncoming
car is starting to get real close and *is* out of control, do whatever you 
need to do to avoid it, but slowing down first will give you the 
manourverability to do whatever is necessary.  I've seen people
jump the gun, swerve because a car was in their lane, only to have
the other car regain control and move back into their own lane
before a collision, leaving them with a battered passenger side and
stuck in a snowbank.  if they had been patient, they might have 
avoided any problems.

&gt; Also, if anyone has a good list of things not to be without on a road trip
&gt; in the winter...belts, nuts, pumps, etc! The AIRS list! :)

what year is your bus?

I'd say a spare fuel pump and fuel pump push rod (if you have a mechanical
pump and/or if you car is *not* fuel injected) -- they're only like
$15 or $20 -- fan belt, tools for timing and tuning, tow straps
in case you get stuck, good, thick jumper cables, perhaps a few flares
in case you do get stuck around a bend so folks coming around the bend
on a snowy day know to slow down.  a couple of days of water, munchies
and perhaps a couple cans of food in case you get stuck in a 
blizzard/white-out, sleeping bags and blankets -- although you'll 
probably have them, a tarp (in case you have to work on the car,
a tarp and/or carboard to lay/kneel on will keep you from getting
wet and insulate you from the cold), a shovel never hurts if you've
got space or a roof rack...

as for other parts, i usually keep all my old ignition parts when i 
do a tune up, so i have spares, to wit: plug wires, plugs, condenser,
distributor cap, rotor, points.  You've already got 'em, why not 
keep 'em handy?  Only other thing i can think of would be spare clamps
and fuel lines...

happy winter 'trippin!
