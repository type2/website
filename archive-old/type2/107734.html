Subject: Re:front disc brakes froze up

Steve.
    I recently had a similar problem on our '71.  The front brakes
were dragging because the brake pedal wasn't coming all the way back
up.  The reason the pedal wasn't coming up all the way is the grease
on the pivot bushing of the brake lever was all dried out.  The lever
I'm talking about is under the drivers floor, NOT the parking brake
lever.  I removed the lever, cleaned out all the old grease and
relubricated it.  Then the lever would come all the way back up, fully
releasing the brakes.
