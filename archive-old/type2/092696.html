Bad battery connection.

Take the cable off and clean them, take the cable clamps off and clean them.

Take the ground strap off and clean the connections on both end.

They make a battery post cleaner - a useful little wire brush. One end is a 
female and used to clean the male post on the battery, the other end is a 
male and used to clean the inside of the battery clamp. Brush until the 
metal is bright and clean on the battery and clamp. Assemble and cover with 
a grease (wheel bearing grease or Vaseline) or cover with a spray for 
battery posts (is red and usually found on the shelf near the wire brush).

You can also do this with a regular wire brush and/or a pocket knife and 
then coat it all with grease if you don't want to leave home and spent a 
few bucks.

You MIGHT have a stuck starter solenoid. Requires a tap with a hammer. John 
Muir's book talks about this in good layman's terms.
