Subject: [T2] vacuum hose

Hi all,

I need some advice.  I have a 72 standard bay window bus with a 1700 engine, 
with dual carbs.  It seems that I have once again had a vacuum hose come off. 
 It stalls at idle, and has very little power.  It feels and acts the same as 
the last time one came off.  I took it to my mechanic who fixed it for very 
little money.  My question is, can I fix this myself?  If so, how do I find 
out where to look for the problem?  I did a visual examination and did not 
find anything disconnected, is there more to look for?

Thanks in advance for all of the wonderful assistance.
