Wire in the outer groove? Please explain, Joel!  I have always used 3/16&quot;
nylon cord.  Are you using some sort of wire instead?  What diameter?  I
am very curious (new knowledge is always a good thing :-)

&gt; for those that have replaced this seal, would working for top-to-bottom or
&gt; bottom-to-top be the best method? does that even matter?

Really should not matter.  I tend to work bottom to top from force of
habit, but...

Jim Hood says you need two people for this but you can do a windshield
alone.  I am not disagreeing on the windshield, tho I have never dared to
try it alone.  I am grinning slightly as I say, the rear hatch glass is
the *only* piece of bus glass that I have ever tried to install alone and
I had very good luck doing it by myself.

The way I did it was to put the seal on the glass, wrap the cord, lube the
gasket, cord, and opening per usual Then I took an 8' 2x4, opened the
hatch and cut it to length to prop the hatch open at its bottom edge.
Lean the 2x4 against the body, close the hatch, insert the glass into the
opening, and press firmly into place.  You want to be sure that the lip of
the rubber is against the lip of the sill.  The open the hatch and prop it
open with the 2x4.  At this point, the strings are hanging in front of
your face :-)  pull the strings and zip it in!
