&gt; I'm really enjoying some of these threads! But they've got me thinking.
&gt; What all mod's  have ya'll done to increase HP/Performance of your

if it were cheap and easy it would already have been done

a really good tune up to specs is about all you can really hope to help
unless/until you spend lots of $$$ and understand that the engine is not
going to last as long and the rest of the bus is going to be underated.


years ago when I lived in Germany I had a friend (not all that sane
but)that essentially put a 1954 bug body onto a porsche 1600SC chassis
(not that simple but)
  we had more fun wwith that thing on the autobahn until the body
litterally fell apart from the strain.....

want a hotter air cooled, search around for a nice 911

be happy you don't have an automatic, bus acceleration is an oxymoron
