Subject: Oil Light won't work: basic but need help
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

List,

I checked the archives and seems everyone has opposite problem ... I have a
light that won't come on when I first turn the key.  Checked the bulb its
fine, have checked the wire it looks fine, I am pretty sure the sending unit
is fine.  This wiring crap drives me nuts ... at least w/ oil leaks etc you
can usually find the problem.  Is there something here I am missing ... does
this light get wired through other places I don't know about ... all the
other lights seem to be working fine ... I am at a loss ... HELP!!!! I am
going camping this weekend and want to leave after work I need a quick fix
as I would rather not drive it w/o this working.

Mike
