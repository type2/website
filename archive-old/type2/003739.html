&gt;As for going 45-50 on a steep hill, don't do it in 4th gear, you will
&gt;overheat.
&gt;
&gt;I consider 50mph to be the mininum hill-pulling speed in 4th gear for 68-73
&gt;busses, and 55mph minimum for 74-82.  At these speeds you are already well
&gt;below the horsepower peak of your engine and the low (&lt;3000 rpm) speed of
&gt;your engine will keep it from cooling as well as it needs to for high load
&gt;conditions.  Downshift and slow down 5mph and your engine will be much
happier.

I agree, downshift to 3rd as soon as the speed dips below 50 in 4th.
However, 40mph seems very slow unless the incline is very steep or one
forgets to downshift.  I go over a 10,000 foot pass in the Sierras from time
to time, and only the last few miles before the summit are too steep to pull
45 in 3rd (and then the road is too curvy to go that fast anyway).  For an
upright engine maximum cooling is at 3800 rpm, I don't know what it is for a
type IV, but it is probably in that range. That is about 45 in 3rd and about
65 in 4th in my '71.
