I hope that I am not meandering into flame or trouble areas, as this 
may appear to be more in line with a Friday type post, but 
.....................
The other day, as I came out of a local bar here in Houston (duh !?), I 
was approached by an attractive young lady (double duh !?) who asked if 
I would mind answering a few questions.
She told me that she was doing a free lance article on bus folks, and 
if I would be so kind as to give her my phone number, she would call in 
a few days to just ask a few simple questions as part of a survey for 
her article.

When we later spoke, I told her about the list, and said I would pass 
on her &quot;poll&quot; to the list for any interested parties to respond, if she 
so desired.

Except for the fact that she will have your E-mail address, this is 
completely anonymous.

So, here goes, as follows: ............

Hi there, VW Bus Person-

My name is Amber Brown. I own a ’65 Splitty named “Jiggy,”
and I am working on an article about VW Bus Owners, the Lifestyle, 
(wacky) personality types, travels and experiences, etc.

If you would be willing to help me out I would appreciate it so 
much!  Following are a list of questions.  Would you please answer them 
and e-mail me back, and I can follow up with you by “e” or by 
phone?  Again I really appreciate any help you can provide.  I’m doing 
this as a freelance piece, and will be glad to send you a copy of the 
final product, including copies of it in its published form, if and 
when that happens.

Okay, here goes [remember, colorful over truthful, and if you want to 
make any reference to illicit substances or conduct (Who, us?), you may 
just wanna give your 1st name!:

What kind of bus do you own? (year, color, modifications, etc., 
including any tattoos or distinguishing marks)

How long have you had it, and is it your first?

Do you do your own mechanical work?  If so, what procedure or 
modification are you most proud of? (including any which are verifiably 
physically impossible on any but a VW)

What road trips have you taken, or are you planning, in your bus?

What stands out as the most memorable experiences you’ve had in your 
Vee Dub (could be a hitch hiker, alien spottings, or rapid bank 
getaways (yeah, right!)

What are your other favorite hobbies?

What do you do to make a living?

Anything else at all that you think might interest a non-VW reader? 
(remember, they’re not like us!)
And finally, if you had to choose 3 words to characterize the VW Bus 
personality?

THANKS SOOOO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP &amp; TIME.  PLEASE E-MAIL YOUR RESPONSES TO:

                 abrown_at_central.uh_dot_edu

I can also be reached by snail mail at:
                 917 ½ Heights Blvd.
