Subject: Re: '71 &quot;pull to the right prob&quot;

&gt; And once in a while, after hitting a pothole/bump, I get a really
&gt; bad shake that seems to come from the right.  So far I can get it
&gt; out of &quot;shudder&quot; mode by turning slightly, then back.  Could all
&gt; this come from a sloppy lower ball joint ?
&gt; 
&gt; Advice/thots welcome,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Not just a sloppy ball joint......that could be a part of your
problem....but check the tie rod ends....I had some that were bad on a
'68 Beetle and they caused exactly the same kind of problem.
