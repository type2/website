Subject: Re: [T2] email addresses on web pages

I'm not sure if it still fools the bots, (anyone have any input on
this?) but you can ascii encode your email address.  I had a friend hack
a popular bbs script to ascii encode the email addresses of posters,
probably 5 years ago now.  A copy is at:

http://lakshmi.volks-web_dot_net/wwwboard/

This is rather cumbersome, but occasionally I use it to grab an ascii
rendition.  

Put some single character in the name, subject and body, but put the
real email address you want encoded in the email field.  Hit the &quot;Post
Message&quot; button.  This will take you to a preview screen.

Look at the source for the page, and copy the characters from the Email:
field, without getting any of the html, right?

As you can see, displays in the webpage fine...

Just exit out of this page, no message is posted.
