&gt;
&gt;I read about using bar oil as an undercoating in the type2 library, but i
&gt;can't seem to find a place to purchase it. Has anyone used bar oil, and
&gt;where did you get it?
&gt;The only bar oil I've heard of is for cutting chain lubricant for chain
saws.  It's real sticky.  I would suspect any hardware store would stock it.
You might want to check out a specialty store for the gallon size container
which is a much better price ounce for ounce.
