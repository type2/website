Subject: Corrections on Vanagons for sale in SE Wisconsin

A buddy just called asking about the westy &quot;tent&quot; with a van I mentioned
on the list.

Should have said &quot;pop-top canvas&quot; .... oops, didn't mean to mislead
anyone, sorry.

Am red-faced about that and if that was not bad enough he pointed out I
said there was a 1993.5 van ..... OOPS! ....what was I drinking this
afternoon, must have been the heat, it is really a 1983.5.  I think it
would be better if I just lay low and lurk on the list until I can get
my head on straight :-(
