I think this is a good idea or at least use a drop of loctite.

I had this nut back off during a trip and the alternator bolt worked it's way out and rubbed against the belt. I didn't even notice it until someone pointed it out to me. The only damage done (beside all the lettering on the belt wearing off) was that the threads on the bolt were damaged and I had to find a new bolt.
