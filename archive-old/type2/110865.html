&gt;Hi-
&gt;Quick note about timing scales: I was unable to find one from any of my
&gt;local or mail-order vintage VW parts houses here in Canada. (I know that I
&gt;can get them from some of our fine US mail-order venders. Crossborder
&gt;shopping is a PITA that I like to avoid if I can.) Out of desperation I
&gt;called my local VW dealer. At
&gt;least here in Canada, The timing scale for our type 4 engines is a regularly
&gt;stocked (&amp; cheap) item at VW dealers.
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Matthew
