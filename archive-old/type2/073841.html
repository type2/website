Subject: 78 fi or carb...it lives!


Just an update and a question.

I stuck with the fi and went Friday afternoon and picked up 4 rebuilt
injectors, a cold start injector and a pressure regulator.

Got home about 3:30 and by 6pm was having an &quot;adult&quot; beverage and checking
all connections and moving tools out of the way.

The engine started after about 6 seconds of cranking!

Seems to run ok, I need to work on idle a little bit.
No oil smoke, but some black(I'm running too rich smoke).

Now for a question...it sounds like it needs a serious valve
adjustment...but it's supposed to be hydraulic lifters.

Is it possible that they are gunked up and not &quot;pumping up&quot; or is there
any adjustment that needs to be performed.  I haven't pulled the valve
covers off yet, but will, cause the pushrod tubes are doing some serious
leaking.  I have replacement o rings for that.

I seem to have good oil pressure.  After the engine has been running for
about 5-10 minutes...I can turn it off and it takes about 10 seconds for
the oil light to come back on.

Cheers, dave
