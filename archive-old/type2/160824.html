Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust change over

Hi Jon,

If you do this swap you really need a lot of extra bits  from a 72-74 
engine. The riser pipes from the fresh air fan down to the heater boxes 
are different, the side tin is different and the riser pipes from the 
heater boxes up to the flappers are different. I suggest you scour the 
local swap meets or contact bustedbus or GermanSupply_dot_com.

I have swapped exhausts back successfully but I had a lot of spare 
72-74 tin and duct-work on hand at the time.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I posted this a couple of days ago but didn't really hear back.  I am
&gt; thinking of changing my stock 78 exhaust system to a 72-74 style.  I
&gt; want to hear from someone who has actually done this to hear how it
&gt; worked out, if all the sheet metal works and the heat channels line up
&gt; and connect.
