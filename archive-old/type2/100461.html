Subject: RE: Powder coating

Bob, I had my wheels done earlier this year in Denver. I paid $25 a wheel, 
but that was without the sandblasting (coater told me he could &quot;bake&quot; off 
the old crap before he finished them), so $40 a wheel with blasting sounds 
about right. In retrospect I would probably have them blasted no matter what 
because any rust, scale, etc. that's left underneath will show through the 
coating as a bump or blemish. I didn't have the bumpers done at the time 
although I wish I had, because powder coating is absolutely the way to go. 
It's very durable and cleans up beautifully.

Hope this helps,
