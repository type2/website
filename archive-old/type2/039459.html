Hi Aaron,

Try not to get too discouraged, the problem doesn't sound as bad as you
might think.  The original fault sounds like an electrical thing - maybe a
duff plug?  You didn't mention replacing the plugs.  You can easily check
the entire circuit on #3 by holding the threads of the plug against the
engine and cranking the engine.  The compression readings, although a little
uneven, don't warrant a rebuild if cash is a problem.  If you get the engine
out and remove the offending head, you can give it a good inspection to
check valves and guides for wear.  The spark plug hole can be repaired with
a helicoil or similar if you take the head to a machine shop.  The cost will
be a few dollars and your time.
With the clutch, check that the cable is not frayed to the point that it has
stretched.  Another possibility is that you mechanic may have routed it
incorrectly.  The guide tube must take a roundabout route over the drive
shaft - if it is too straight the cable ends up being too long.
Hope this helps your dilemma a bit.
