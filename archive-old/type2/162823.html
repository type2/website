Subject: Re: [T2] Turning Brake Rotors

&gt;  there is no return spring on the front disk brake pistons - what 
&gt;lets the pads pull back from the disk?

	This is normal for disc brakes.  There is indeed no 
spring-loading to keep pads off disc.  It surprises most of us when 
we learn the pads can drag on the disc when pedal is furthest off the 
metal.  Indeed one very minor tactic for better fuel mileage is to 
change lanes every few miles on the straightaway, to nudge the pads 
off the disc slightly  ...
