Subject: Long Block

Folks:
After messing around with a couple of junk engines for
several days, I have come to the conclusion that they
will not equal one running engine.  I guess it's time
to bite the bullet and buy a long block.  The choices
boil down to buying a rebuilt from someone or plunking
down the cash for a zero mile engine.  
Does anyone have a good (cheap) source for either of
these options?  Does anyone have other ideas/options?

TIA, 
Dan
