&lt;&lt; just a thought i seen a bus once that had the front tire replaced on the 
front with a radiator and it still looked like they had the spare tire on front 
but this must of taken some thought and exspense...
not sure of all the specs on it though or where i seen it and read about it 
on the web except it was white... &gt;&gt;

Same one I saw, and IIRC the radiator alone was over a grand to have made 
up...
Very clean looking, too.
