Subject: FS: 1974 VW Bus - Free

Good afternoon! I am offering for free* a 74 VW Bus that had an unfortunate
carb fire. I don't know much more about it than that. I rescued it from the
previous owner who was moving and couldn't take it with her. The back story:
She had been living in Montanna and was relocating to the DC area. She was
driving the bus during the summer through to DC. The right carb caught on
fire in Kansas. She put it out with dirt from a nearby field. She then had
it towed all the way to DC.

Body wise, the bus is in fairly good shape in terms of rust. All I can see
is surface rust. The bus has what I call a &quot;farm&quot; paint job. There is also a
couple of large dents in the side that were filled with bondo. I scraped one
of these down, and it was just a large dent, not rust.

The engine turns over by hand. I would say the carbs need to be rebuilt.
They are Weber 34 ICTs. There is no battery, the tires are dry rotted and 2
of them are flat.

Included is a whole nother engine from a 72 Bus. It is in pieces, but mostly
complete. I can throw in a 72 VW Bus tranny as well. (I just got to drop it
from my other bus, which is getting a corvair transplant)

So - to sum up - 74 Bus - Good Body, bad windsheild, bad interior, carb
fire.
