Subject: RE: [T2] Input shaft and motor install (1600 into '76 bus)

On three separate occasions I have installed a 1600 upright motor with a
later model
tranny. The easiest way for me to make the input shaft work was to cut off
1/4 to 3/8
inch of the tranny input shaft with a hacksaw and a carbide blade. Worked
just fine
every time.  The same problem (too long input shaft) also exists mating a
1974 Subaru engine in a 1970-72 Subaru tranny.

The alternative is to install the shorter input shaft.
