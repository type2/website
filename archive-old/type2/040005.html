Subject: Re: Bus Legalities

I just found the California laws regarding the liquor part of the question.
It's on the California Legislative Pages at:

http://www.leginfo_dot_ca_dot_gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=veh&amp;group=23001-24000&amp;
file=23152-23229.1

The text is as follows:

23225.  (a) (1) It is unlawful for the registered owner of any motor
vehicle to keep in a motor vehicle, when the vehicle is upon any
highway or on lands, as described in subdivision (b) of Section
23220, any bottle, can, or other receptacle containing any alcoholic
beverage  that has been opened, or a seal broken, or the contents of
which have been partially removed, unless the container is kept in
the trunk of the vehicle.
   (2) If the vehicle is not equipped with a trunk and is not an
off-highway motor vehicle subject to identification, as defined in
Section 38012, the bottle, can, or other receptacle described in
paragraph (1) shall be kept in some other area of the vehicle that is
not normally occupied by the driver or passengers.  For the purposes
of this paragraph, a utility compartment or glove compartment shall
be deemed to be within the area occupied by the driver and
passengers.
   (3) If the vehicle is not equipped with a trunk and is an
off-highway motor vehicle subject to identification, as defined in
off-highway motor vehicle subject to identification, as defined in
subdivision (a) of Section 38012, the bottle, can, or other
receptacle described in paragraph (1) shall be kept in a locked
container.  As used in this paragraph, &quot;locked container&quot; means a
secure container that is fully enclosed and locked by a padlock, key
lock, combination lock, or similar locking device.
   (b) Subdivision (a) is also applicable to a driver of a motor
vehicle if the registered owner is not present in the vehicle.
   (c) This section shall not apply to the living quarters of a
housecar or camper.

23226.  (a) It is unlawful for any  driver to keep in the passenger
compartment of a motor vehicle, when the vehicle is upon any highway
or on lands, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 23220, any
bottle, can, or other receptacle containing any alcoholic beverage
that has been opened, or a seal broken, or the contents of which have
been partially removed.
   (b) It is unlawful for any passenger to keep in the passenger
compartment of a motor vehicle, when the vehicle is upon any highway
or on lands, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 23220, any
or on lands, as described in subdivision (b) of Section 23220, any
bottle, can, or other receptacle containing any alcoholic beverage
that has been opened or a seal broken, or the contents of which have
been partially removed.
   (c) This section shall not apply to the living quarters of a
housecar or camper.


&gt;
&gt; So would it be legal to convert the windshield washer reservoir to hold
Jack
&gt; Daniels if the hose were routed to the cabin?
&gt;

So, in both laws, the &quot;living quarters&quot; of a camper are exempt. After a
windshield washer bottle full of Jack though, you might argue that the front
seats are living quarters.

I also talked to a Kern County Sheriff one day about the status of RV for a
vehicle. I read somewhere (probably in the CA Law) that a vehicle must have
3 or 4 of the following:

Stove, Sink, Shower, Fridge, Shidder, Bed, and maybe a Dining table.

Anyway, he said the &quot;State of California Department of Housing&quot; plate on
Itch qualifies nicely.
