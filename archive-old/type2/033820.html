Subject: Re: to buy the '71 or not to buy

&gt; So.... if you have $2,500 to $3,000 for a bus project I say go for it. IT
&gt; WILL BE WORTH IT......
&gt; 

yup, i bought my 72 westy not running 200 miles north of my house. been
haveing all kinds of troble with the idle, i drive it here and there
anyway, starts like a champ, at every intersection. its at the mechanic
getting a used carb put on right now. in the end it cost me about $1200
for the bus, but im creeping tword $3000 in parts.. i'll probably have
spent $4500 total when im done.
