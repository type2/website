Subject: parts for 69 westy  (Or fubar, part 3)

finally got the brakes working, but bent the hell out of the backing plate
getting the ebrake cable loose.  question is:  where can i get a
replacement backing plate?  the van drives fine, but the drum rubs against
the plate and make the most annoying sound ive ever heard.  and since i got
all this stuff taken apart, i may as well get 2 new ebrake cables and fix
the brake for the first time in 20 years.  i'll try the busdepot in the
morning as soon as i can, but anyone else have any suggestions?
