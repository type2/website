Your pulley is destroyed?  REPLACE IT!:)  It may well be the cause of all
of your electrical problems. Not to mention cooling problems..:)

Not a bad idea, but not worth it if a bad pulley is all that is wrong with
your generator.

You will need a alternator stand, alternator, and the piece of tin that
the alternator attaches to (which then attaches to the fan shroud..)


&gt; at it I think I'm going to throw in a 009 and a blue coil.  Do you thing

If your current coil and distributer are working fine (hook a timing light
up, and rev the engine...see how much advance your distributer is giving.
check that against the specs in the Bentley..), then a 009 is a waste of
60 bucks. And a blue coil is nothing more then the coil you have, painted
blue. At least, as far as your ignition system is concerned.

&gt; changing over to an alternator will illiminate my problems, or would it
&gt; just compound something else.  This is on a bone stock 1600 dual port

Changing to an alternator will only CAUSE problems if you do it wrong.:)

But putting a 009 in combination with a 34 Pict3 carb is very well known
for causing trouble.  Hesitation being the major concern.  Check the
archives concerning both the 009, AND the alternator conversion.

My opinion, replace the pulley with a good straight one (be aware that not
all of the new pulleys you buy are any good.  I've seen 3 right off the
shelf at NOPI (after the 3rd, I gave up. Put a used one on..:) that were
seriously deformed.  The center spindle was welded to the front half of
the pulley CROOKED.)  If that doesnt fix your electrical problems, then
look into checking your regulator, and generator to find the problem
FIRST.

Find the problem, then solve it.  Dont just slap parts at it.

If it does turn out to be the generator, then perhaps an alternator might
be worthwhile.  The 009, on the other hand, is good only if your
distributer is worn out, and you NEED to replace it.

later...david
