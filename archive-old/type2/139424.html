&gt; on a 76 vw camper the passenger seat how does it swivel ? also their

The disk is the swivel piece; it bolts down to the pedestal, and 
presses down on the rail piece.  A lever from the rail piece locks into 
a slot cut in the disk.

(I think I have that right... I thought I took photos of my swivel 
setup when I did my seat restoration, but alas, I did not.)
