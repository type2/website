Welcome to the &quot;Gene Berg Memorial Cruise&quot;.  I live about 2 miles from the
Lynnwood Autovice store.  I am looking forward to seeing you there.
Although I have been planning on the Shoreline CC show this is the first I
have heard of you all coming so close to home.  This is my first post to
&quot;type2&quot; although I have been with VintageVW for awhile. See ya then,
David W Scott
