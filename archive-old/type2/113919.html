&gt;Well, if there's not, and I can figure out how to remove them from Giacomo
&gt;without breaking them in the process... :O)

The vents would be nice, but what I really want is the defroster inserts on top of the dash.  These are getting hard to find in decent shape, and I've not seen any repros for sale.  Anyone else?  I was about to spraypaint mine to try and slow down the decomposition.

They are a bit more complicated than the other parts you've talked about casting... how good are you?  :-)
