&gt;1.What is the general consensus on sway bars?pros/cons?

Of course you know you've already got a factory-installed front bar.  So I
assume you're talking about the bigger aftermarket bar along with the
aftermarket rear bar.  Here's what I have to say:
1.  If your shocks are old/worn, replacing them (with a set of KYB's
preferably) will do more for your handling than new sway bars with worn
shocks.  Put your money here before buying sway bars or tires.
2.  Replacing your passenger tires with a set of light truck tires will make
the bus less likely to wander, less prone to being blown around on the road,
and will make you safer.  Put your money here before buying sway bars.
3.  After you've got the right shocks and tires and you still want better
handling, sway bars are next.  DON'T install a rear bar without installing a
bigger front bar as this is the quickest way to make a really wierd-handling
and dangerous bus. 

Sway bar pros:  less body roll in corners/curves - a definite plus for a
Westy!
Sway bar cons:  less individual wheel travel for nasty off-road driving.

&gt;2. aftermarket oilcoolers.

Not necessary except on really high-performance motors or buses that are
being used to pull trailers.  A properly tuned type IV motor with all the
original sheet metal and thermostat flaps will stay plenty cool on its own.

&gt;3.is there an easy way to replace the screen in the poptop(the canvas is in
great shape,of course the screen is decayed beyond belief)?

I'd try a canvas awning/tent repair place?  Check your yellow pages and be
creative.  I suppose you could even do it yourself if you've got a
manly-enough sewing maching to deal with the canvas.  Hopefully other
listees will have better suggestions for this one!
