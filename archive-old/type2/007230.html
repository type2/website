Subject: Bad t-stat cause
Mime-Version: 1.0
importance: normal

List,
Finished my budget rebuild of 1800 in April/May.

I am now maybe 1500 miles into the first 3000 mile oil change.

I installed a new t-stat when i built it, but it now appears to be bad - fully expanded when cold.

I know it's not possible that it was physically damaged - could i have run hot enough to kill one of these thermostats?
