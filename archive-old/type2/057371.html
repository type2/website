Heh.  :-)  I suspect you're about the only one.

&gt;  Say I have a '79 2.0L Engine and I want to chuck it into a lonely
&gt;engineless '81, are there any significant modifications that will be
&gt;necessary?

I can't say for sure since I haven't done that swap, but I have gone in the
opposite direction.

&gt;Can I use the '79 tin?

No, you will have to use the 81 tin and any of the 81's parts that the tin
attaches to that are different.  Not sure which parts those are.  I also
can't remember if the fan housing is the same - you may have to change that
too.
