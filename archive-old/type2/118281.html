&gt; Just go to the smog referee like everyone else coming from out of
&gt; state with a federal model, get smogged, pass and drive it. 

...good deal, thanks.

&gt; I'd get
&gt; an emission test done in your current state first to determine if
&gt; it's worth bringing in your vehicle: 

Hmmm, it passed with flying colors two years ago here in Maryland but
I'm currently running on an extension due to having to replace my
exhaust system around the time I was due at the testing station.

&gt; it may need expensive
&gt; modifications to be brought into line with CA code depending on what
&gt; the PO did to it before you bought it.

PO had an unusual collection of aftermarket exhaust on it but that's
all been replace now with OEM stuff.

&gt; Email me for details if you are considering doing this in future.

Thanks....I don't anticipate this happening this year but it may.


Sincerely,
