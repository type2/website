Subject: talking about valves

Volks,
could somebody offer some definitions for me:
Burned Valves:
Valve Lash:
Also, what are the risks to valves that are tightened to .002 (too tight) or 
loosened to .010 (too loose)?
Finally, when a shop does a &quot;valve job&quot; what does that include? (besides 
presumably, adjusting the valve gap).
Thanks,
Jeremy
