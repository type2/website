Subject: [T2] Replacing windshield seal

I just replaced my windshield seal today.  I was getting water in the cab,
and traced the trickle to seal.

Just some tips from my experience, FWIW:

Cut the old seal, from inside, to get the window out.  Its a throw away
anyway.
You need a friends help to support the windshield
The new seal is a beast to get on the winshield.  a pipe clamp helps, you
can use it to hold the sides of the seal as you go around.

Use a cord in the groove in the windshield.  Put the windshield in the
opening, and pull the cord into the cab.  The rubber lip comes over.

Its not as simple as that.  The rubber isn't easy to get properly placed.
It takes a lot of tugging and banging.  I used my fist, and whacked a small
piece of plywood with a hammer.  Turns out, the windshield can take a decent
whacking.

Once things are in place, push and whack the rubber against the body metal.
You need a good seal, and its tight against the windshield when you put it
in, so you have to push and whack it to set it on the body metal.
