Howdy all!

Michele and I are going on our first trip in our '81 Westy...up to Seattle via 
the &quot;Scenic Route&quot;  We will be leaving early Sat morning.....if any of you see a 
tealish-blue Vanagon Westy with white rims,top and black bumpers driven by a 
long-hair in a black hat with a lady long-hair, give us a wavy honk or two!

I just finished installing the oil and head temp guages.  I have a question or 
two about what they say.....should I freak out?

The oil temp so far is OK...hovers between 190F and 220F.....I'm fine with 
that...(I am using a sump-plate sender...they don't make dipstick senders for 
Vanagons)

The head temp guage, however, reads 340F-450F, depending on my 
speed/RPM/incline, etc.  I have the thermocoupler thingy attached under the base 
of the #3 cylinder spark plug....the hottest external engine part, right?  My 
FLAPS friend says that the plug dumps 63% of its heat into the head, thereby 
giving me an incorrect (high?) reading.  Everything seems to be good 
otherwise....advice?

Thanks,
Gene
