Listening to my local mechanic I replaced some non bosch plug wires with the
genuine item. Only to then have my bus start but not idle. I just paid the
for mentioned mechanic to bring me up to specs with fuel air mix etc.
Frustrated, I waited a couple of days and I went back to it and found a
disconnected vacuum line and off I was. Now I suppose I will eventually be
so well acquainted with all vacuum lines that this will become less of an
issue but ...... I am not sure I have had a harder time with a mechanical
device ever.

So now everything should be great right. Well the bus is running and idling,
but it feels like it has less pep. I have to stay in 3rd on hills where I
was previously going back into fourth and cruising before felt as if there
were more to the pedal and now it feels like I am at max. Any ideas why this
may be so??? 

I have checked the mechanics timing it was fine - the clutch needed minor
adjustment so I did this too. I am also still getting a strange flutter in
my tach when accelerating - but I do not hear or feel the clutch slipping.
Again any ideas are appreciated. TIA
