Greetings Volks,

The name's Tom Draffen.  Tomorrow I will be the proud new owner of a bouncing
baby VW. This will be the second - the first (78 7pax &quot;Junior&quot;) having left my
care a handful of years back.

This time I am showing up in San Diego and will be owning a 1970 1600 dual
port. (Vin 2202082743).  He'll be named &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; as he was by his PO
(for obvious reasons if you see me driving down the road in him).  I'll have
quite a bit of work to do on him when I get him into the shop for the first
time.  He drives good, though the brakes are particularly soft.  Even in my 78
I didn't need to stand on them quite this much.  Typical things are missing
(engine seal, some of the tin).  I'll need to replace the shoddy job of CV
boots the PO did, and with my luck the bearings as well.

End of the story is another owner in the San Diego area - and looking for some
fellow owners in this neck of the woods.  I'm a US Marine out of Miramar and
anyone that wants to piggy back on me - I'll trade VW mechanic assistance for
auto hobby shop time at the base shops around San Diego (hydraulic lifts,
tools, etc... )

Give me a holler if you're out there!

Thanks,
Tom Draffen

1970 Bay  &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;
