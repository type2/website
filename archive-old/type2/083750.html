Subject: Re: [T2] MAX out your Propane Capacity / Do propane tanks HAVE tobe Cylindrical?

Gary Lee has a 50L tank (I am not sure it that is total size 
or usable size at 80%) that he says extends the range of his 
van by 300km.

http://www.telusplanet_dot_net/public/gary2a/rack/propane/propane
.htm

FES Autogas has &quot;Dough-nut tanks&quot; that occupy the space 
normally reserved for the spare tire. They are between 35 
and 70 litres in capacity (28 to 56 usable). Typical range 
for their 57L (45 usable) _at_ 5.5mpl (25mpg) is about 250 
miles.

In addition Reimo sells tanks from 21L to 60L (16.8L to 48L 
usable) that would fit in place of the stock tank... or 
under the sliding door. Though the larger tanks give up some 
ground clearance.

With unlimited funds, I'd get a 70L tank in place of the 
spare, and probably two 38L tanks for a total capacity of 
146L (116.8 usable) that plus my stock 16 Gallon gas tank 
would carry me farther than I would EVER be able to drive 
without having to pull over for nature's call.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;Do you guys have any idea, of how large them LP tanks would 
have to
&gt;really be, to get father than just around the block?
&gt;
&gt;I don't think that there is enough room under these vans to 
be giving
&gt;any miles per load---
