Subject: VW yard sale
Message-Id: &lt;990415081943BF.04436_at_www5.iname_dot_net&gt;

I toured a VW yard that is for sale - lock, stock &amp; rain barrel as the saying goes.  It is located in Zearing, IA.  This is just northeast of Des Moines on I35.

Currently holds over 150 VW's, some parted, some complete, some driveable.
Lots more loose parts - complete doors, hatches, hoods, bumpers,
fenders, roof sections, etc.
Also much mechanical, including complete engine &amp; transmission units, front axles &amp; such.

I visited this yard on vacation and took some pictures - would anyone 
care to host these on a website?  I should be able to scan and email 
them as well.

Bus stuff
I counted over 35 breadloaves, a dozen splittys dating back to '59,
 including several single cabs.  Some Vanagons, but mostly aircooled.

Other stuff
Several convertible Ghias, early Bugs (both convert and sunroof) 
and Type 4's.  Overall tough shape for the older stuff but all restorable.

I have sketchy details on some of the pictured vehicles,
 but the owner would be better to contact.

Let me know if you want more info - I'd like to see these VW's find a good home.
