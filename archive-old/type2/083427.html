Subject: ground

Lots of talk about good grounds. I had to replace my
battery ground cable. I bought some flat/braided
ground strap and new connectors. I made one for the
battery to chassis ground and another to go from the
chassis ground bolt direct to the engine. I know that
the tranny ground strap handles that function but it
is old. This gives a good direct ground to the engine
and is a handy place to connect to if you have to jump
someone or get a jump that is a reasonable distance
from the battery.

Also my son wants a squareback. Any leads to some good
info sites would be great. P-mail me off list. I am
looking at bug vrs. squareback crashworthiness for
one.

Thanks!
