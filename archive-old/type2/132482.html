Subject: Re: [T2] Slider Cover(s) Removal

Hi Volks,

Use a 1x6 rather than a 2x4, it will fit better under the cover and 
direct the force closer to the side of the bus where the part is 
attached. A piece of 1x6  about 2-3 feet long will spread the impact 
nicely. Make sure the retainer bolts/screws are removed, and if you 
want to be really thorough squirt some release-all or penetrating oil 
or just WD40 into the joint from the top. Now BEAT on the the 1x6 
firmly and steadily until the cover pops off the bus. Mission 
accomplished.

Happy trails,

&gt; I had to pull those covers off the Duck a couple of years back when

&gt; piece of  2x4 and a hammer.  Obstinate doesn't even begin to describe 
&gt; it!  30+
&gt; years of sun, dirt, and rain had effectively set those covers in place.
&gt; I had to work on them for quite a while.  Problem is that brute force 
&gt; will
&gt; not get the job done either.  After all these are sheet metal parts 
&gt; which will
&gt; distort under unbalanced pressure.  So.........you just need to take 
&gt; it slow
&gt; and easy with a reserve of patience.
