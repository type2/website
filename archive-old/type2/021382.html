Dave:
The difference between 40W oil and 10w-40 or 20w-50 after some miles is
considerable.
I'd go with a straight weight 40W in the summer. I'd also consider a synthetic
or synthetic blend if I liked the brand. Most of my engines use some oil and the
difference between $1.20 a quart and $4.00 a quart is too much for me to put
onto the pavement.
(I'm not totally against trying synthetics, I've used synthetic gear lube in
many transaxles and been very pleased.)
And actually, synthetics have been around quite a while, in limited racing use
clear back in the 60's.
Winter is another story. I'd stick with a multi for winter (you said daily
driver).
Last April I took a road trip in my waterboxer Vanagon. I realize these engines
are a little different, but they, too, work the oil pretty hard. And I work the
engines pretty hard- did a lot of 48 second miles pulling a trailer. I changed
the oil before leaving, drained out the multi-vis and put in straight 40 weight
Shell. Shell Rotella has a very good reputation among fleet operators and I
figure they've probably learned something.
The oil monitoring light on the 87 would previously go on when warmed up, but
doesn't now. (2.1 Waterboxers and possibly earlier ones have a two stage light
system that sets off a buzzer and the oil light if the oil pressure falls below
20 psi at engine speeds above 2000 rpm.) So, I guess it helped somewhat. This
engine has 140,000 miles on it and soon will need to be rebuilt.
