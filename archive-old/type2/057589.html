Subject: Late Model Stuff For Sale

Location:  Saint Louis

This morning I aquired a bunch of late model type 2 items.  I have not gone
through it yet but there are two virtually brand new childs cots, two rear
window screens (great shape), side windows, door window tracking, door
panels, and much much more.

Brian and I will be doing an inventory this next week so if there is
anything specific you need please let me know.  I will answer any and all
with a yes or know, but it may take a day or two.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
