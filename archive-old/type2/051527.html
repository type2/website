Subject: Re: [T2] Tow Bar

I've towed busses using 1/2&quot; all thread bend and bolted via 2 nuts and
giant washers to the tow loops welded to the front of the bus.  The all
thread goes to 2&quot; (or 1.5&quot;?) pipe that holds an ordinary bug towbar. 
For insurance, the pipe has bars ubolted to the front axle also.  I can
send pics as attachments if you like.

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone used a VW Tow bar?  Does anyone have a picture of one or a really
&gt; good description?  Will it fit somewhere in the bus?
