Message-ID: &lt;3810E833.7FDD48F4_at_stic_dot_net&gt;

Hi listees;
   Just got off the phone with Nikki Elko. The fellow David Schwartz
referred her to in San Angelo has pretty much found the source of her
problems. The collision evidently jarred the idle solenoid out of the
hole and also busted the left carb linkage, pretty much putting the left
side out of commission. He fixed/jury rigged all that and now they're
waiting a few hours for the engine to cool to adjust the valves
(compression down to 25# on cyl. 4) and get her running well enough to
get home.
   She said that she was&quot;utterly thankful to David Schwartz for his
lessons on carbs &quot; that he gave her a while back. And she is very
grateful for all the input/ phone numbers etc. that all of the
responding list members have provided. I'll be continuing to monitor her
progress and forwarding helpful phone numbers/suggestions/warnings y'all
provide.
   The response makes me proud to be a list member.
   You guys are great.
   Nikki said her friends in Calif. thought all this sort of helpful
stuff died out in the 70's...this proves them wrong.
   On top of all that, no self respecting Texan would ever fail to help
a woman in distress.

Thanks;
