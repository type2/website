Subject: Re: [T2] Potential Trailer Hitch Info

That's what I was able to find out when I searched the web.

Who got the equipment and patterns?

Maybe somebody would give up the patterns and we could make them ourselves 
(or at leas distribute the patterns in .pdf form so folks could make our 
own). Less liability that way.

Frankly I don't want to pull my hitch and bumper off. It's a two person job 
(you need a helper to hold the other end while you bolt it up). I did it by 
myself last time and was making up words you can't repeat in polite 
company.... More related to my abilities (...lack of) and not the design of 
the hitch!

Really simple though!

&gt;Sorry, volks, Gibbes is GONE! Just like dealer-held ACVW parts we really
&gt;need! I live in the Columbia area and there is a new Univ. of S.C.
&gt;building where Gibbes Volkswagen and Gibbes Machinery used to be. Sorry
&gt;about that!

&gt; &gt; I put a used trailer hitch on my van a few years ago that  I got from a
&gt; &gt; good friend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is a 1 piece hitch that requires no new holes to be added to your van.
&gt; &gt; You sandwich the hitch brackets between the body and bumper brackets.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Very good for light duty towing (stamped for up to 1500 lbs. I think).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The label that  I recovered from it when I painted it says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TRAILER HITCH VW Type 2 Part Number 210
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Manufactured by Gibbes Machinery Company, P.O. Box 648, Columbia S.C. 29202
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope somebody will find this useful. I don't know how current this
&gt; &gt; information is (or if   Gibbes still exists)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I did do an Internet search and everything I saw was pointing to
&gt; &gt; the  Gibbes Machinery Company as being a relic from the past...
