Subject: RE: [VB] [T2] friday topic new bussing song compilation

Hmm, this morning I played a Korean/Japanese duo that bill themselves
out as 'Seksu Roba' which translates to 'Sex Donkey'  (just don't go
typing that into google and expect a reasonable response!)  let's see,
what else, Ted Leo, Left Front Tire, Dufus, Ladybug Transistor, Bjork,
etc.  During the first hour of the show was a favorite world music title
from Fiamma Fumana.

... life is too short for only one CD!  Then again, none of my drivable
split window busses have on-board music.  The running of the bus is too
important :-)

&lt;snip&gt;Don't forget :
Crystal Method, Armin Van Buuren, Cosmic Gate, Growling Mad
Scientists, Infected Mushroom and let us not forget Scooter.
Song names? : Scooter : Ramp Logical Song or weekend
Cosmic Gate : Human Beings
GMS : hmm pretty much everything .. 'Hyperactive'
IM : hehe everything.. do a search for 'acidkiller'
Crystal Method : Name of the Game  (find a remix if you can)
And if you can find this : Odds - Heterosexual Man


Ok, I realize I just alienated everyone on the list lol!
