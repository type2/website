&gt; &gt; Its the same lube you use for the manual transmission, 85W90 Gear

&gt; ok after months of reading about gear oil on both lists i figured gl-4 was the going 
&gt; item.  seemed ok to me but this am i decided to see what had been used in my garage 
&gt; for years.  trundled out to the barn and retrieved the yellow gear oil bottle only to 
&gt; find it completely different than the 'recommended'!! so what does this mean?

manual tranny's need GL-4 in Dino oil
auto tranny's use Dextron in tranny and GL-4 or GL-5 in final drive
synthetic tranny gear oil is different from dino oil and reportedly can be
used in VW manual tranny's 

YMMV

does that confuse things enough?
