Subject: RE: [T2] shifter adjustment

Bill,

I used the napa hose when I redid my 78.

It is very stiff, but if you cut it on a bias on the tank end

\---------------------
 \
  \
   \------------------

put it in hot water before installling and use plenty of your favorite
lubricant, you actually slide it around pretty well.  I also used &quot;real&quot;
worm gear clamps instead of the phillips head originals.  Last time I 
filled it up, I deliberately topped it off to see if it would leak.

No problems, no gas smell.

I *did* take out the ecu so I could hold the metal pipe from the
filler while I twisted it around to get on the tank.


Hope this helps, Dave

&gt; I know that we have crossed this path in the past. Yet, I have just
&gt; completed this job on a friends '78. The short hose from the tank to the
&gt; metal filler pipe is a 2 1/4 hose and has a slight bend. I used a straight
&gt; section of pipe from Napa, 2 1/4 in inside diameter, and cut it long so that
&gt; I was able to bend it. I would also recommend cutting the tank side of the
&gt; hose at an angle so as to not bunch it up on the rear side. All this done
&gt; with the engine in.
&gt; 
&gt; What is happening with the transmission?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     The bus is finally running and I took it for a drive tonight down
&gt; the road a little. I also put some gas in at the station. I replaced all
&gt; the bushing
&gt; and regreased my shifter,but can't seem to get it adjusted properly. Any
&gt; tips on this? I also had pulled the gas tank and replaced all the hoses
&gt; and fuel sender. The only hose I did not replace was the hose from the
&gt; tank to the filler pipe. As everyone knows it's not available. Mine did
&gt; look ok though. When I squished it I didn't see any cracks so I put it
&gt; back on. When I stick my nose near the right rear vent I can faintly
&gt; smell gas. I think! I hope the hose didn't fall apart when it got gas on
&gt; it. I am hoping the smell is from the paint on new parts burning off.
&gt; I&quot;ll keep
&gt; my fingers crossed. I want to know when one of the vendors is going to
&gt; reproduce it.I tried the Napa hose and it didn't work and I tried to
&gt; find something at a Marina with no luck. Oh well. I'll hope for the best.
