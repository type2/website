Subject: Re: ('62) Scored Another Brochure!!!

&gt;Alan (who gave it to me) says he also has a Ghia one from the
&gt;same trip which he'll look out for me. AND he told me where 
&gt;there's an early 911 hiding in the area which is sort of for sale. The
&gt;story goes that a German soldier was over here, the car  broke
&gt;down, he left it at this motorcycle repair workshop, and never
&gt;came back for it. It's reported to be a real mess, but worth a
&gt;look I reckon.

Looks like you got something very unusal, and unique!  What about the ghia,
is it still there?  Probably a rust bucket. 

On another note, what do you drive? pre or post '68?

I drive a 1956 karman convertible............NOT!  I take the train...blah.
But I hope to locate an early split bug to bring back with me to California
when I go home someday.  For now, I am just getting teased.

Cheers,
