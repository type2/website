Subject: braking with your engine?

A little while back one of the postings, I think we were discussing brakes,
included an aside that knocked the use of the engine as a vehicle brake on
long downhills.  Assuming you are judicious about the revs when you
downshift and you're kind to your clutch, what's the downside of using the
engine compression to slow the bus on a long slide?  Or didn't I get that
right?
