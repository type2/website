Subject: Re: [T2] help with idle and cold start

We have a bus with a confirmed dead cold start valve.

It helps our van to floor the gas pedal when trying to start it cold.

My theory (unconfirmed) is that it moves the flapper in the flapper box 
causing the computer to send more gas to the injectors.

My .02 cents only.

Your idle problems I don't understand though b/c once started both our 
busses will idle perfectly no matter what the temperature.

My guess is that either your EGR valve or your injector seals are leaking 
and sealing once it all warms up.

&gt;I wrote asking for help with this once before and got no response. I guess 
&gt;I will try again. I have a 79 westfakia that runs great with an engine 
&gt;w/aprox 2000 miles on it. Cold starts do not happen unless I step on the 
&gt;gass. I have been told that w/fuel injection this should not make a diff., 
&gt;but it does. Idle once started is low and/or non existant - stall. Once I 
&gt;have driven down the block a couple of stops signs later though it idles 
&gt;fine 900 rpm. I also have problems with stalls/idle after driving for 
&gt;various periods of time both short or long, stoping and running into a 
&gt;store and then starting up again. Same sort of problem happens here - 
&gt;stall/low idle, drive a little -good idle. Some times I get an in between 
&gt;state where the idle is low 5-600 rpm, but I can almost hear something 
&gt;kicking in that raises it to around 900. Where should I start trouble 
&gt;shooting with this. I have read the bentley before with respect to the 
&gt;cold start but find it extremely confusing (I will try again - if at first 
&gt;...........).
&gt;One last thing, while checking the electrical connection to the coldstart 
&gt;I noticed two wires on one lead and only one on another. I have another 
&gt;coldstart that I pulled off another 79 (new this by checking the front 
&gt;window id#) at a junk yard. This cold start has only two wires - not sure 
&gt;what this means but ..... maybe I need to trace the wires?? TIA for any help
