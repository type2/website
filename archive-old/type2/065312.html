Subject: 82 engine questions

After checking out the 82 engine that died in the desert, it appears
that three valves were way out of whack, # 2 intake stuck,  no broken
pieces to speak of.

I ordered a set of heads from MS.  My mechanic says that either the
last adjustment (1 month ago, not him) was terrible or the hydraulic
lifters could be shot.  They sometimes clatter for a few minutes
after starting if the van had sat for a long time. 

A couple of questions:
What fails on the lifter?  Do the lifters just go bad at a specific
milege, or at randon, several at once?  
If I had one or more valve seats move, would that render them
useless? 
Should I just replace these lifters now while its pulled and open?
I think the engine had gotten hot!,  Could the heat kill the lifters
or more likely bad adjustments or age.?
What's a reasonable cost for these and quality?

Also considering de-glazing the cylinders and putting in new rings. 
MS recommends the German ones.  Are they so much better?  I have seen
a puff of blue smoke occassionally when first started.  It used 1 qt.
of oil per 700 - 800 miles.  Always has since I bought it 1.5 years
ago and the oil leaks have been fixed so it couldn't hurt.

That about it, I used my fun tickets and now need advice.  Any ideas,
advice, horror stories or other info would be appreciated. TIA 

I saw a license plate contest results in yesterday's paper.  One
plate from Oklahoma which said:  GO VAN, is that anyones from the
list? Could not see the vehicle type just a picture of the plate.
