Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Hitch for sale

&gt;Any photos of this bus hitch?

http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/latebayhitch.htm

I have had one on my bus for years and its great. I did have to remove the 
gravel shield that is bolted to the underside of the bumper though, but 
thats a minor thing considering the functionality of this hitch.

I have put thousands of towing miles on mine...

Here is a link to pics of my bus with Jamies Hitch..
