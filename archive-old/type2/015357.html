&gt;Tim,

&gt;Just guessing, but how fast is the aux air valve closing?  how fast is it
&gt;supposed to close? 

Removed and put it in the freezer for a half hour, hooked it up to 12v and
watched it smoothly close in 2 to 3 minutes, re: Nominal.

 Also, is the cold start valve running during the first
&gt;15 seconds?  During the next 3 minutes? 

Starts beautiful. Temps too high for it to activate but for less than a
second. System nominal.

If you have an EGA handy (I sure
&gt;do wish I did :-)  I would check whether it was running lean or rich
&gt;during both periods.  

EGA will not catch the few seconds of gas when event occurs. And will
always show way rich (4% + O²) under normal rich warmup idle.

There is a whole sequence of events that is supposed
&gt;to happen during warm up on FI that are strange and mysterious. 

Two things occurs during warmup. Mixture (pulse width) is lengthened in
proportion to temp sender by ECU and tapers till fully warm. Air bypass
meters extra idle air for a temp indexed period. A sticky bypass valve
would explain similar symptoms, but not EXACTLY 45 seconds to fault EVERY
TIME, and then for only an indexed period till warm, then all is functional.

 It sounds
&gt;to me as tho the A/F ratio is fine during initial warmup, then goes
&gt;lean/rich as soon as the aux air valve closes (or fails 
&gt;to close)... cracking the throttle lets the AFM take over metering and it
&gt;will stay running, tho.
&gt;
&gt;Just a a bunch of random thoughts early in the morning here (OK, it's
&gt;9:00, but I am a dedicated night owl :-) 

Helpful, because I have been considering pulling the ECU and inspecting the
circuit board and trisisters. If the computer is switching to different
circuits to control warmup mix in response to temp, when it swithches to
the circuit that controls from say, 150° to 200°, it would explain this.
But it's a black box, they don't give us the algorithyms and such. 

 I will continue to think on this
&gt;and let you know if I come up with anything else.  I have been fighting
&gt;the FI on my '73 ('78 FI installed) for three weeks now and it is becoming
&gt;second nature :-(

They take a while to understand. When you get glitches that will not
respond to Bentley procedure, it's just an oportunity to find your fault or
otherwise learn something, then tell everybody else.

Thanks for the help.
