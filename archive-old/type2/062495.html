Subject: Derelict bus treasures

On the way home from BBTA I stopped for a few hours to get 
a few bits off the '63 23-window I sent the picture of for 
Thom's Hall of Shame page.  The bus has no front or rear 
end and has been used as a storage shed for the past few 
decades.

I got the jailbars, coat hooks, cargo door handles, ashtray, 
and all the exterior aluminum trim except the front (was 
bashed in) and the lower driver's side rocker trim (was 
buried and dented).  

As I was taking the rocker trim off under the cargo doors, I 
lifted the floor mat and saw 2 17mm bolt heads.  Hmmm... 
That's where the bolts would be for an ambulance step...  I 
start digging in the dirt under the rocker panel and sure 
enough, there is an ambulance step there.  I go get my floor 
jack and jack it up enough to put a log under the bus so I 
can get the jack under a frame member.  So with much trouble 
I got a ambulance step also.

Total price for these bits:   $20

(not too bad)

Dave
