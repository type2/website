OK listees, I'm back.

I'm the guy who has been here with the exhaust leaks, the oil leaks, the
30 psi compression on #3, the cant get the engine back in, that infamous
damned PO who hadn't changed the oil in 6000 miles, and the problems with
the lurching once i got the engine back in.  

That morning--before I left on my trip.  I got one or two replies
suggesting what it might be.  I went with my hunch and bought a new coil
and wires and it still urched. I figured it was just obnoxious and would
see if it would drive me to Pullman from Olympia, WA.  Lurching along a
couple hours later I heard a big clunk-clunk and lost power.  I pulled
over thinking a rod had gone trough the case or something.  I had stopped
tightening down the coil when the case of the new one started to crush.
Figured it was tight enough.  It wasn't.  THe coil fell off into the fan
hub since i hadn't replaced that silly looking netting thing.  this tore
all the wires in half.  So fifteen minutes later-a couple connectorss,
some new wire and some solder and I was back on my way.  I got to Pullman
and spent the next 7 days painting houses-lurching down the road 20 miles
per day.  Finally got to my e-mail and the award goes to sean bartnik for
the most accurate diagnosis of the problem which included a helpful
description of how to fix it.  I bought a &quot;real&quot; timing light and found my
timing was at 16BTDC!  SH*T!  MY distributor could not be rotated due to
being improperly installed by me. Proper installation of the distrib.
allowed me to easily set the timing.  Wow, no lurching.  I also did my
&quot;300 mile&quot; (actuall 400) oil change since I did new rings with my new
head.  I then drove it 300 miles back home with Sean Bartnik's statement
about--&quot;hope this advice doesn't reach you too late--if you drive that far
your engine may be hurt badly.&quot; (paraphrase) 

Once on the way home after stopping the battery didn't have enough power
to turn over all the way so I spent ten minutes pushing my bus up a hill
while scooting a brick along with the fron tire so I could rest after
every push. Drove next 30 min with all electronics off hoping to charge
battery. Stopped bought gas and it would almost restart.  Took some time
to write down my gas.  Now it starts but hesitantly.  OK Whatever!  On the
road stop at home after blasting stereo for two hours in stop and go
traffic in western WA.  Bus won't restart.  Oh well. Unpack. Now it
starts!?  WHats going on? WHo cares. To bed!  Compression test this
morning revealed my worst fears (cold test).  
#1--120psi				
#2--120psi		add some oil...
#3--60psi		to #3,4....	#3--60 psi
#4--70psi				#4--90 psi

Well guess driving at 70 mph for 4-5 hours with your timing at 16BTDC will
kill your brand new AVP rebuilt head.  F**K!

So my choices now?
--------Spend another 180 for a nother new left side head, install it
	and continue to drive the bus waiting for myself to make another
	expensive mistake--Are there any left?
--------Replace the head, sell the bus with a &quot;recent rebuild&quot; (120 psi on
	all four) and buy some classic American V8 powered gas guzzler.
	(this option is seeming more and more appealing.)
--------Just drive it how it is until it dies.  It is currently sounding
	better than it ever has before!

Any suggestions appreciated.  I paid 1800 for this bus.
-79 California (something I recently discovered) Kombi with interior from
a 73 &quot;Campmobile 70&quot;, new linoleum floor,  decent interior.  Good floors.
SUrface rust in quite a few places that has been treated with something to
turn it black and stop it growing.  Both front corners have dents due to
the alcoholic lady that used to own it.  It has no EGR present--so I
disconnected the arm fron the trottle valve to the EGR.  It has none of
the Claifornia exhaust stuff and instead sports a EMPI dual exhaust
similar to the GT Sports system in looks.  Heat exchangers are in great
shape.  It drives straight all electronics work I don't think the gas tank
is full of rust or that it has any of the other numerous problems any of
you seem to have.  Thats one thing the list is encouraging for! All
windows are good.  TIres are new.  All it needs now is another new head.

Final Question!
--Should I keep this-replace the head and paint it later after doing some
body work? Or, should I sell it-(I know you won't think so) What could I
get for it?

TIA (sorry for thength-needed to vent)
