Subject: Re: [T2] Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

&gt; What ignition wire set should be used? Can the federal Bosch 09171
&gt; ignition wires be used or must I get something different? If so what?

From the Bosch ignition parts catalog:
09171 is used on ALL typeIV engines from 72 thru 83. Regardless of point
ignition, electronic ignition, Cal or Fed version.

&gt; When the stock VW electronic ignition coil goes bad, what can be used to
&gt; replace it? Just another used coil, or can I get something after market?

As far as I know, ONLY the 00 041 coil can be used. This is marked 211 905 115
B on the bottom. Do not use the later Vanagon 211 905 115 D.... The 68-79
Bentley, section 5 page 78, says 211 905 115 C only. I have never seen a C on
any 79-83....always a B.
The 211 B came on a lot of vehicles: Audi, Porsche, VW water cooled cars,
Volvo.....
I had the coil die on my bus outside of Flagstaff, AZ and I went to a
AutoZone. They had no different listing for 79 CAL bus, their book did not
seem to think there was any difference. So I had them look at 80-83 Vanagon.
They did show a different coil for CAL version so I bought it. It was a Wells
brand. It worked fine and got me back home to Fresno, Calif.

&gt; Lastly, should the vacuum lines to the vacuum advance/retard distributor
&gt; be left connected or disconnected when setting the idle and timing? I
&gt; have seen post stating both. My 85 Bentleys also states both. Which
&gt; should it be?

79 Calif. did not use the idle stabilizer control unit. Timing was set at 5
After WITH retard vacuum connected AND working. [if you have the retard
disconnected or not working timing will be at 7.5 Before]
80-83 Calif Vanagons came with the idle stablizer. Timing was the same as 79
Cal except you have to disconnect both connecters from the stabilizer and plug
them into each other. This takes the idle stabilizer out of the circuit and
turns it into a 79 Calif system. Reconnect the idle stabilizer when done....
