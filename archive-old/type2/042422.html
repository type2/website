Subject: Re: lost for a name

Your bus should be named accidentally.  Like my bus.  It's a big yellow
thing, and the janitor at the place I work called it the yellow submarine one
day.  So therefore, this is it's name.

    I also had a plym0uth scumdance that blew it's airbag and cracked it's
bell housing one day when I went over a curb.  It's name is now &quot;the little
b!tch&quot;.

    So, ask your bus what it's name is.  And if all else fails, call it
Blazin' Orange Dream!!!

Rock on wit yer bad self.
