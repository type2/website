&gt;e) This is Cosmoline, and if it wasn't on there your tank would have arrived
&gt;as a rusty lump. Kerosene should dissolve it, then Marine Clean, then U.S.
&gt;Standard Fuel Tank Sealer for rustproofing. I know John at aircooled_dot_net has
&gt;it (it being U.S. Standard, not Cosmoline), I think Ron Salmon at Bus Depot
&gt;does too, and RMMW used to have it but I don't know anymore.

Pretty sound words BUT...

I'm going to chime in against this one folks.  Right now the US Standard
would seem a real good idea.  Indeed I've used it in some restorations, BUT
I don't think in a new tank it is worth the risk.  Two times already past
tank sealer formulations have been made worthless and deadly to fuel
systems by changes in gas formulations.  Wasn't the fault of the products,
was the fault of the US government, times change.  With the ongoing
advent of more and more &quot;oxygenated&quot; or higher alcohol content fuels
I wouldn't risk using a sealer unless I had to (rare tank, unavailable with
pinholes) just isn't worth the future hassle.  Keep clean gas in you tank,
keep it full, add stabilizer if its a closet queen.  I've taken 30 year old
tanks out of the rustiest WV bays you've seen and they've been like brand
new inside and out.  VW didn't plate them originally, the new ones aren't
any worse.  If you've ever taken a tank out that has partially dissolved
sealer and I have, you know what I mean.  Another thought if you do
need one sealed is have it done by a commercial place (radiator shops)
they often do do a better job than you might.

I would paint the outside of any new tank carefully though.

Just my opinions, a lot of people have gotten bit by this in the past
and the products they used claimed nothing on earth would dissolve them
at the time they put em on.  You can't predict the federal government.
