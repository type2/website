Subject: Re: [T2] Head interchangeability Or 2L heads needed

From: &quot;David Schwarze&quot; &lt;schwarze_at_mail.ev1_dot_net&gt;


&gt; &gt;I have the opportunity to buy a set of &quot;D&quot; port heads for a good price
but
&gt; &gt;wanted to know if they would work or not.
&gt;
&gt; D-port?  Do you mean rectangular port heads?  If so, they will not work,
at least not very well.
&gt;
&gt; -David

I do not know what D port heads are, that is what I wrote the list for?
That is how the seller Identified them and said they should work but to
double check so I asked the list.

I didn't think it sounded right.

Thanks for the help..

Peace Brother,
snoopy
