Subject: new muffler still stinks

I wrote last week that I installed a new German stock style muffler on =
my 71' stock 1600 bus and it smelled like burning paint.  I got many =
suggestions, including replacing all my engine seals (which I did).  It =
has been a little over a week and it still smells in the cab when I turn =
on the heater.  Is this normal?  How much longer am I going to have to =
deal with this?  Please help.

Scott
