For the moment the type 2 is the Hottest VW collectible out there!--A
check on the early 23 windows is proof of that--West Coast--East
Coast--No matter--the 23 window for now rules!! But------A clean VW Bus
1st --2nd or 3rd generation will find a new home Quick!! Especially the
camper versions--The VW camper is still a bargain compared to what is
out there--In January here in Aridzona there are at least 3 major car
auctions--It is NOT uncommon to see an Early VW bus sold for over 10
Times the original list price--And go to a new home in Europe--or else
where--This does Not mean it will happen to the 2nd or 3rd generation VW
bus--But i can say a clean, straight, VW bus no matter What year is SOLD
quickly if the price is right--The reason for this--is simple--
There is NO competition for VW in this type of vehical--When it comes to
&quot;The Bus&quot;,
there is just one --Volkswagen--there are no options---uj
