Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

Hiya RD,

To add to what Westy had to say about the leaks being &quot;magnified&quot; by the 
altitude the canister could be contributing to the problem.  Most folks have 
either forgotten or didn't know in the first place that these charcoal filled 
emissions canisters have a definite lifespan.  VW recommended that they be 
changed out every 30,000 miles much as you would an air or oil filter.  When 
they are left in use beyond their designed life the charcoal pellets inside 
fuse together into a lump.  Consequently, the air being pumped from the fan 
shroud into the can is blocked.  That means that the hydrocarbons are then 
effectively left in the lines to the can.  Of course this situation with 
leaky lines is bad at any altitude, but the higher you go (Geez, don't you 
need oxygen at 10,000 ft.?) the worse will be its effects.

FWIW............I've always been interested in the E-Can and how it worked.  
This summer one of my projects is to find a cheap and effective way to 
&quot;renew&quot; these old cans.  A new replacement from VW (yes, they are available) 
costs around $70US and they are a superceded part; which means, in this case, 
that the new plastic E-Cans don't fit the old applications very well.  As of 
now I have a couple of the old cans apart and I have located the refill 
media.  Although I still have some work to do on this project, it looks as if 
a refill/renewal can be done for less than $15US.  I'll have this finished up 
by the end of the month and post my results for The List.  In the meantime, 
if anybody has any questions, comments, insults, or innuendoes please do zap 
me a p-mail.

Mike
