Subject: I want to see your Vanagon Westy, looking to buy one.

		Hello all,
		  Well after this great trip with the West Westies to the
Oregon Coast it became very clear that my 71 Bus was just not designed for a
family of 5. I love this Bus, but my Wife thinks that it is too small, and I
have to agree with her. She did not come with me, but we are planning a trip
in June. I would like to show her a Vanagon Westy and see if that would work
for us. I know that they only sleep 4, but I think I can fix that.  We have
3 small kids. 
		  So what I am looking for is this, if you have a Vanagon
Westy and live in the Tacoma area or know of a Westy in the Tacoma area that
is for sale, I would like to take my wife to go see it. 
		  If I can convince her that is what we need, I will be
looking to buy any Vanagon Westy at the lower end of the price scale. This
means I will take a non-running Air or Water cooled or Ideally a Diesel. I
like the Diesel even though they have very little power, and it makes for an
easier conversion to a Golf/Jetta motor in the future. 
		  Right now the 71 Westy is not going anywhere, but if you
are interested in it I will be open to offers. Recent pictures can be seen
at http://www.wetwesties_dot_org &lt;http://www.wetwesties_dot_org&gt;  under the
UnSuperBowl weekend pictures. It now sports a SO-69 interior(not shown on my
web page).
