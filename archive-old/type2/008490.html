Can someone please forward this to the vanagon list.

I just looked at a 84 Vanagon Westy.  The van is in good overall shape, 
one minor ding and some paint fade, A/C and auto.  The interior is in 
good overall shape, some wear to the drivers seat.  128,000 on the 
odometer.  The local kid that bought it 6 months ago paid $3900 and then 
put about $1200 into exhaust and brakes.  Now he has a head gasket 
problem.  He knew nothing of the trouble with this year model.  He has 
no more money to sink in the van and wants to get out and recoup some 
money.  He told me he wants $3,000.  I offered him $750, but he said no.

Ron at the BusDepot says a motor will run about $2000 plus return of the 
core, plus installation.

Please get back to me if any interest and I can forward the phone 
number.
