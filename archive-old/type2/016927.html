Subject: Need thermostat bits

Has anyone got any thermostat bits around?  Specifically the parts
48-53 and part 55 on the picture in the Haynes, page 23.  I'm going to
get a new thermostat, part 54.  I also need one of the little metal tabs
and screws that holds the flap rod down.  This is for a '75 with a 1.8.

More than willing to pay a reasonable price and shipping.

Thanks,
Robert
