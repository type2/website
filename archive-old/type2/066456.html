All,
Went to the used bookstore at lunch trying to find &quot;The People's Guide to
Mexico&quot; from John Muir Press.  They didn't have it.  I did get a paperback
copy of &quot;Small Wonder&quot; for 48 cents.

Anyone have an extra copy to sell or care to look at their used bookstore
for me?  Same for &quot;The Velvet Monkey Wrench&quot;.

Thanks,
Dean
