&lt;&lt;The engine in a 914 is mounted backwards - the fan is towards the front
of the car, the tranny sits behind it.  So 914 heat exchangers feed
exhaust towards the tranny end of the car (and extend just about as far
as the nose cone of the tranny).  So if you put them on a bus, the
exhaust would exit toward the front of the bus.  Of course, you could
always run a set of side pipes (exiting just in front of the rear
wheels) like you see on some of the old hotrod cars :-).&gt;&gt;

Now that would turn some heads.

I may have to take a look at one and see if it could be modified.  Anyone want
to contact the manufacturer and look into having them made for buses?
