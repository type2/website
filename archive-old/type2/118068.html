Subject: Honk-Honk!

Hiya All,

I posted last week with a couple of question concerning reconditioning horns. 
 Thanks for sharing your knowledge Todd and George.  It sure did help.  I 
spent a couple of hours today cleaning, &quot;remanufacturing&quot;, and reassembling and I 
have two working OEM Type 2 horns to show for my efforts.  No more of those 
cheapie FLAPS one-size-fits-all Bug horns for me.  I love that deeper throatier 
&quot;honk&quot;.  And the great part was that it was really a fun little project.

For those of you considering tinkering with a horn, you might want to point 
your browser at www.lut.fi/~hosia/horns.html   A great article featuring Hella 
horns and their repair.  This Bus maintenance business has its side benefits.  
I've learned a little about VDO clock repair and now I've fixed horns.  Is 
this fun, or what?
