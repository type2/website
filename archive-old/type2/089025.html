Subject: Re: [T2] Help with crankshaft endplay (it's WAY out)

 Three shims are required to properly center the crankshaft
in the main bearing bores. Four shims is out of the range.
A thrust cut ( and compensating bearing ) will restore
the case to functional use. This usually is performed along with
an align-bore, the cut required to restore the main bearing journals
which provides a clamping force on the main bearings.
This is necessary to maintain and direct oil pressure to the rods.
If oil gets past the outside of the mains, those rods are starving.
The fact that there is play in #1 main indicates that it is not
clamped, and is working it's dowel pin hole oval.
This will cause the dowel to oval in the case as well,
and ultimately render the case useless if not repaired.
This case is past &quot;first thrust cut &quot; of .020, in the range of
&quot;second cut &quot; ( and maximum of available bearings ) of .040 &quot;

I can make these case repairs for people who don't have a
closer source in the Northeast US.  ( * unauthorized facility :)

&gt; I'm helping a friend fix her '71 Bug, which she has owned for 17 years. The
&gt; front seal was hemorrhaging oil. Anyway, pulled the engine today and the
&gt; crankshaft end play measured .76 mm (.025 in.), way too much by the
&gt; rudimentary Muir gauge standard.
&gt;
&gt; Everywhere I look it says put three shims under the flywheel but folks, I
&gt; can't correct the end play with three shims.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone tell me why one should only put three shims under there? Why not
&gt; four?
