&gt; Not feeding and caring for your Bus at least as well as you would for your
&gt; child or dog is unconscienceable. You would bive them both all that they
&gt; need and more for what they want. Do the same for your Bus. It wants to
&gt; perform as intended with reliable purpose. It needs most to be as
&gt; originally designed in order to do that. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Damn, that sounds tuff !
&gt; But I gotta agree !
&gt; I agree a lot !!

Know that if you have an electric pump and you are invloved in an accident
wherein after the crash the key is left on while your subdued by your
concussion, the key will be on and the fuel pump will pump fuel into the
ensuing fire till the tank is empty and all is carbon, including you. All
vehicles designed with electric pumps have safeguards built into the system
to prevent this liability. How many slapon electric fuel pumps have an
inertia switch added? 

Not to mention how many of these electric pumps go bad in very short order.
They are afterall, designed to sell to any who don't want to bear the
expence of doing what's right, what best protects you and your Bus, keeping
things stock.
