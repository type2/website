If you do have money to spend, this setup sounds like a honey:

Good news:  No computer needed to program, relatively easy programming,
ability to run in closed loop mode, ability to use wideband sensor.

Really good news:  All the documentation is free on their web site, none
of this &quot;buy our system and we'll tell you the secrets&quot; BS.  I spent an
entire evening reading the volumes of information on this site!

Bad news:  $883 US for fuel only, $1311 for fuel and crank-fire spark.

However, this is a proven, fully assembled, unit with a 13 year track
record, a lot of successful installations, including aircooled, and folks
that rave over their technical support.  Sometimes it pays to spend more
up front.

Megasquirt is certainly a viable alternative.  I've put together my share
of Heathkits in my time and realize that, even with their &quot;we won't let
you fail&quot; instructions, I occasionally ended up with a kit that didn't
work, certainly a frustrating experience.  With EFI systems, the
complexity is added to the complexity of the engines and it is really
scary to me.  Sometimes it pays to let someone else work out the bugs!
