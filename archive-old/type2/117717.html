&gt; Moral dilemma...
&gt; chit chat, one of 'em asked me if I could get him some 'weed', since,
&gt; &quot;you still smoke, right?&quot; Well, actually I don't, and I was wondering...
&gt; Would it be a bad thing (shades of Martha Stewrat), if I told 'em to wait 
&gt; there and I'd be right back with some 'weed'. Now I figure I could get to 
&gt; the Shop-Rite and buy two bucks worth of oregano and bag it up in about
&gt; a half hour. If I sold it to them for twenty-five bucks, I'd make a profit
&gt; of twenty-three bucks...My dilemma: Does the list think this is a 'fair' 
&gt; profit margin or not... ?-)
