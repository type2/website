I know very little when it comes to carbs but the throw of the little arm on 
the little gas squriter that has the diaphram inside so when you press on 
the gas pedel it gives a squirt of gas to the carb, I think that that can be 
adjusted to give a bigger squirt. I think that you need a bigger initial 
squirt to start the engine. Sorry for the somewhat vague discription but I 
think I had this problem when I had my 69 Baja with Delorto's carbs. A 
bigger initial squirt helped quite a bit on that 1641 that I had built at 
the time. Also the timing had quite a bit to do with easy starts. Just my 2 
cents ,   Cree
