hmmmmm, seems to be a repeated theme here...., : )

Since so many of these systems are disabled/disconnected, Its quite possible 
that trying to resurrect one may result in, at best, something with marginal 
performance that will only cause you to re-discover why the previous owner 
decided NOT to run it/repair it.

I'd seriously consider a modern conversion system.  I'm sure new compressors 
run MUCH more efficiently than those built 30 years ago.  If you are still 
running a 1600 bug motor in you 3000lb+ bus you will want all the effieciency 
you can get!

If AC is very important, it also may be time to consider a type 4 conversion 
at your next rebuild.  With almost 20 more stock hp, its much more capable of 
powering AC without cooking itself.
