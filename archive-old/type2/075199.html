Since the tin is not materially involved in the radiation of heat off the
engine it shouldn't be a big deal one way or the other *what* color you
paint it.  I agree that integral parts of the engine that *are* involved in
heat transfer (e.g., heads) shouldn't be chomed or painted light colors.  As
I recall, Hoover recommended against high-temp paints for these parts
because the formula that gives them the &quot;high temp&quot; facility (clay??) also
interferes with the heat transfer process.
