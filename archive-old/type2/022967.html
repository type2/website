Subject: Whistling while you drive
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,

Last night I replaced my original passenger door seal on my '73.  I bought 
the seal from RMMW for $20.  It arrived a day early and looked to be of 
good quality.  I searched the archives and found that 3M weatherstrip 
adhesive was the glue of choice to fasten down the seal.  They didn't have 
it at Autozone but had Permatex weatherstrip adhesive which I bought 
instead since I had two kids with me and didn't feel like driving all over 
town.

Anyway, the old seal was crusty and falling apart, and at speeds over 60mph 
(less with a headwind) I would get an annoying whistling noise from the 
passenger side window area.  I thought that replacing the door seal might 
cure the problem, but unfortunately it hasn't helped, in fact it seems even 
worse now.  If I open the passenger window even 1/8&quot; the whistling 
stops.  So can anyone tell me what is causing the whistling?  I only 
remember it being a problem in the last couple of years.  I have a 
highroof, jalousie windows, and a raingutter with small holes drilled every 
two feet (presumably for some sort of attached awning in this bus's history).

Thanks,

-David
