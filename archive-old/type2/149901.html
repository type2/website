Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment Redux

&gt; Now, some of my valves seem to behave differently than others.  There
&gt; are two behaviors as I cycle around the cylinders:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I push on the rocker lightly with my thumb, it &quot;clicks&quot; open just a
&gt; little bit, and stays open when I remove my thumb.  Then I can measure
&gt; with the feeler at my leisure.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I push on the rocker really hard, and it &quot;springs&quot; open, quite a
&gt; lot.  When I let go, it springs shut again.  Thus, I have to maintain
&gt; pressure on the rocker with one hand, and use the feeler with the other.

That sounds like you have hydraulic lifters and the lifter is soft. The
valve spring cannot be compressed by hand so I can only assume it's the
spring inside the lifter.

&gt; For example, when I have the engine lined up for cylinder #2, the intake
&gt; valve &quot;springs&quot;, while the exhaust valve &quot;clicks&quot;.

I've heard this noise when the push rod hasn't properly seated in the cup of
the rocker arm and move when you rotate the engine.
 
&gt; The Bentley manual doesn't even mention pushing on the rocker.  Which
&gt; should it be, should the valve stay open or spring shut?  I'm afraid I'm
&gt; pushing the rocker too hard and thus tightening down the screw too much.

You should push on the knurled part of the rocker arm with a screwdriver and
there should be no movement no matter what kind of lifters you have.
