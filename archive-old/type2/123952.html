Subject: Alice: Up &amp; Running

All of last spring, summer, and fall, and on and off again this summer...

... the late nights, covered in grease, trying to piece together...

... the broken little '71 camper I bought for $800 and had towed thirty
miles to my house...

... her engine in bits and parts in greasy boxes, mind-boggling mixed with
parts from a '72...

... her interior shredded, filthy, and water-soaked...

... now idles on her own and purrs like a kitten, for the first time since
starting this project.

I had never even seen a VW engine before buying this bus...

... and now I have built one, with the help of many patient friends...

... and I couldn't have done it without the Library, the Archive, and the
List.

The project has ended, and now the journey begins.

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.
