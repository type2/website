=============================&gt;
Be careful!

I originally put the JC Whitney stuff in Maizey about 5 years ago, only to
discover I had a problem.
I put the foil side against the metal ...... and .......... condensation
between the foil and bus metal started to occur on those occasions of
extremes of night and day temp variances.

I flipped the pad so the felt was against the metal, and the condensation
problem stopped.

As but one example...
With the foil side of the pad against the sleeping floor, my wheel well
(storage pod) full of tools became a wheel well full of wet rusty tools.

Having reversed the pad so that the felt was against the metal, I no
longer have the problem of condensation against the floor and blanket
interface.

Problem #2
After putting the pad in the bus (felt side against the metal), be sure to
go investigate after the first heavy rain. If you have a leak, the pad
holds the water, and the aluminum prevents fast drying.

Bonus hint #1
Pull that black cardboard stuff that VW put in the engine compartment
above the engine, and replace it with some of this aluminized pad. Use
spray  glue to initially get it affixed. Then cover the felt with a piece
of heavy gauge flashing, cut to the same dimensions as the black stuff.
The job will take about 30 minutes, and provide you with an unbelievable
sense of quiet and pride in your ride.
Now you can listen to the hard rock loud, if you want, or you can listen
to low level soft music, as well. The drone from engine noise will be very
much way down into the noise floor.

The aluminized felt really does insulate well .... for both noise and
temperature.
Applying some of the techniques found on the various web pages to combat
noise and heat/cold makes all the difference in the world to long haul
travelling enjoyment.
