If the  reverse gear has slipped out of engagement with
the key that slides it into  and out of engaging, then
the gear is floating on the shaft and can engage  /
disengage depending on the attitude of the bus. If I
remember  correctly, a nose-down position disengages it
whereas a nose-up position  could engage it. There is
the possibility it could get really ugly  really
suddenly! -BaH 



hello Guys    This isn't correct. the only part that can  slide off  is the 
small reverse gear on the input shaft that is held in  place by a circlip in 
side the diff area.. the way that reverse is engaged is by  the slider hub for 
1st and 2nd gears . For reverse the only part that moves is  the small engaging 
gear which is on its own fork that moves onto this hub. Now I  have seen a 
lot of the circlips come loose and allow the reverse gear to slide  and 
therefore not have a reverse , I have seen this happen also that when  pulling the 
motor the input shaft will come out with the motor. This will not  cause the 
tranny to lock up. For the tranny to lock up it has to go into 2  different gears 
at the same time or a bearing seize. This is how you torque  parts of the 
trannie when you are putting one together by locking it into 1st  and 3rd gears at 
the same time.The reverse is the weakest part of a vw tranny as  it has 3 of 
its 4 gears being only about 1 1/2 in in diameter. I tell everybody  to try 
not to back up any hills as this is very hard on these small gears.On the  
trannies that I have seen that poped out of reverse it is normally the small  
engaging ,gear that is eaten its edges off. On trannies with no reverse it is  
normally the input gear that has come loose.   later  Mark  Dearing
