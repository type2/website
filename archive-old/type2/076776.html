Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

Mmmm,the usual argument.
I just had my 2.0litre engine fully rebuilt and had a
009 put on it.
The only problem that I experienced was because of the
heat build-up on the black rotor button and a quick
change to a red rotor button stopped this problem.
I've read all sorts of reasons why you shouldn't put a
009 on your bus, even on a 1600 based engine and to
tell the truth I don't notice the difference.
Has ANYBODY got a good reason why I shoudln't have it
there?
Cheers

&gt; I've checked the archives on this (try typing in
&gt; 009, NOTHING comes 
&gt; up). They didn't answer my question. I've been on
&gt; this list long 
&gt; enough to HEAR that you shouldn't put them on a BUS
&gt; because the power 
&gt; curve (or something like that) is all wrong, but I
&gt; have never seen 
&gt; any tests and data on it. Can anyone point me in
&gt; that direction?
&gt; The reason I'm asking is because last night I was
&gt; leafing through a 
&gt; popular VW magazine and saw a 009 on a single cab
&gt; pickup. I thought 
&gt; to myself &quot;If someone were to spend all that time
&gt; and money restoring 
&gt; that pickup to perfect condition, why would they put
&gt; that 009 on it? 
&gt; It doesn't enhance the performance. Don't they know
&gt; that?&quot;
&gt; Am I missing something here?
