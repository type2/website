Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

Bob,

Use the por-15/fiberglass/por-15 sandwich  combo.

You really are goingto need to pull that windshield and check....might
use the combo above without resorting to welding.

It would be lots easier that way...I used the por-patch and por-15 when I 
first did mine...before I could afford to have it painted.


Cheers, dave

&gt; but to make a long story short I discover while doing this that the lower
&gt; lip of my windshield is pretty rough shape.. now I know you can buy them
&gt; and I'm a fair to middling weldor but the question is how hard is it to
&gt; pull an 78 dashboard far enough away from the metal to not burn the bus
&gt; down with the MIG welder... don't need to change out anything just need to
&gt; not burn up my dash....of course I need to take out the glass, I already
&gt; have new rubber for that..but have never actually changed a windshield.
&gt; 
&gt; if anyone has done this before and has some hints' I am more than willing
&gt; to pick your brain....
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
