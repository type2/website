i have a good offer on jerri [my Bus] from a guy in the US, the
trouble is he can't seem to get around customs until
jan. 1 2003 when the bus is 25 years old.  the dep't of
vehicles down there says he has to pay $500 to get it
inspected for the US.  the odd thing is that Jerri is
from FLA???

any ideas?
