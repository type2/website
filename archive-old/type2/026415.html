Okay, only on Friday would anyone let me get away with posting this, but maybe some truth can be found in my words. Maybe others of you will see yourselves in this description and realize that you too have been terribly wronged.

I've decided to seek legal counsel regarding this bus addiction which has caused me and my family such tremendous emotional and financial duress. It has come to my attention that a major manufacturer, using clever marketing techniques grounded in behavioral psychology and cognitive research sought to manipulate me at a very young age so that I would be drawn to purchase their products. They manipulated market data to convey a sense of scarcity so that I would feel inadequate if I did not purchase their products. 

Unable to respond to these neural impulses in the early to mid sixties, when I was so manipulated, I repressed these impulses until the only way I could feel adequate in myself was to give into this addiction and respond with such fervor that I neglected other aspects of my life.

Who knows what I could have done with my life if I had not been driven to this bus addiction. Clearly, many failures in early adulthood can be traced to this latent tendency. The money spend in parts alone, to feed the addiction, of course, could have been wisely invested in technology stock and would have grown to millions, I'm sure.

Some of you may have been driven to criminal activities, including infringements on trademarks and copyrights. (&quot;Your honor, I must respectfully decline to answer that question on the grounds that it may be incriminating.&quot; --watergate dude, heard right after a bus commercial, as I recall.)

I will only be seeking fair compensation for my losses. Class action, anyone? :) Joe
