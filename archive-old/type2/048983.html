I paid $thirtysomething for lifetime antique plates in Nashville, TN on a 71
Campermobile which I've built a stove into. Never have to pay again, didn't
need emissions testing. =)


&gt; I just ad to pay $104 instead of $30 for 2 years since my 82 westy had a
&gt; built in stove.  That is how the state of Oregon differentiates a
motorhome
&gt; from a van.  They told me take out the stove &amp; be reinspected &amp; they would
&gt; reissue me car plates.
