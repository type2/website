Subject: Re: Want A List Coffee Mug???

I'd be happy with a tapered no spill type mug that was ceramic, not plastic.
  How's that for a possibility?

 A friend has a hand made one with a vw logo on it that I secretly covet,
useful for not spilling my tea on me, which hasn't happened since this
morning.
