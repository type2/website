&gt; Jack,
&gt; I've noticed the same thing with my Kombi, but I've also noticed the 
&gt; Kombi has a fair amount of &quot;squat&quot; and is sitting like it has a full load
&gt; in the back.  I'm thinking this is my problem, and was wondering if your
&gt; Westy was sitting a little low in the rear causing you to lose rearward
&gt; vision as well.

&gt; Hi All
&gt; I need to lower the inside rear view mirror on my 83 Vanagon Westy air
&gt; cooled so I see something other than the road 30 feet behind but there

Bay window buses have the inside mirror positioned so that you cannot see
the horizon through the rear window.  I'm not sure about the vanagons,
though.

The caution here is not to fiddle with the rear suspension unless you're
_sure_ that it is out of spec.  I adjusted mine till I could see out of
the rear window and was rewarded with strange handling, tire wear, and
torn CV boots.

At rest, buses normally sit high at the front, since the driver's weight
is missing.
