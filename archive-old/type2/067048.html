There are some diagrams floating about on how to make a transistorized
trigger for an otherwise stock ignition system.

As a point of reference, my 1976 Toyota Landcruiser runs fine, with about
170,000 miles, on the original points using a transistor ignition.  I have
tried to replace the points as part of a tuneup, but the only ones sold for
that year are the version *not* for electronic ignition. (California 1976
Landcruisers are unique)

Except for antique cars wishing to be perfect, everybody should change away
from the 1920's technology of points/condensor/coil ignition.  The points
will last forever, the coil lasts longer (maybe forever), the plugs last
longer and the cleaner spark will help emissions.  I cannot think of a single
downside to the modern ignition.  If it were mine, I'd chuck the points as
well, and replace them with either an optical or hall-effect arrangement.
If you don't want to cobble your own, these are readily available for rip-off
prices (considering what's in 'em) of less than $100.

Or consider looking around a junkyard for something around 1980, with a
carb, that probably uses a transistor ignitor intead of a condensor for
the ignition.  Many cars of this era still used points, so the coil and
ignitor are just a drop-in to your basic ignition system.
