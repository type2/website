&gt; Now I'm ready to go out and have a class IV hitch welded to the frame, so I

          I was seriously thinking of renting a tow dolly to pull behind my
van so as to move my other van up to WI from AL, but my son talked me out of
it with &quot;You know what it's like going down the highway in the van when the
wind's bad and then you get passed by a semi? Towing the other van would
double that.&quot;
