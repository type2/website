&gt; Yah.. it's the bus Im talking about.

You can run 195s, though 185s are the preferred size

Stock is 185R14.  Since there is no section ratio, it defaults to 80 or
82.  You can run a load range C in this size.

A 195/75R14 is a bit smaller in diameter, and has less load capacity for a
given load range.  You need to use load range D in this size.

There are a few 195R14 size tires around.  They seem to be a good fit for
a bus, a little taller than stock and therefore closer to the size of the
original bias ply tires.
