I stopped at my mechanics' today to try to get pics of that
Adventurewagen but the man I needed to talk to had stepped out and I
lost my light. I'll get the pics mañana. HOWEVER, I did get to meet the
wife (&quot;Beeber&quot;) of the guy who owns the 1991 Vanagon Double-Cab Truck
I'd seen (and gawked shamelessly at) driving up the main drag a couple
of weeks ago. She was picking it up after having some work done, and she
let me take a picture of it. I'll post it as soon as I get it developed
and scanned. They got it in NoCal; it's originally from Canada.

And I'm a bad influence on my roommate: She's starting to see buses
everywhere and point them out. Like last week we were watching TV and
that commerical for the the gigolo movie came on and she jumped on it --
&quot;Bus! Bus!&quot; 

It's an obsession, I tell ya.

Nikki
