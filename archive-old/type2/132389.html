&gt; I've been driving my 78 regularly for a few months but have a similar
&gt; problem to Paul's.  When my gas level is below the 1/2 line bus runs
&gt; great.  When I top it off, bus runs poorly and there is a leak in
&gt; front of the left rear wheel.  I've replaced several visible pieces
&gt; of fuel line before putting this bus on the road after it sat for 4
&gt; years.  Guess I need a diagram to help me out.  The one in Bentley
&gt; doesn't cut it.

The fiche diagams aren't much better. The fuel path isn't that complicated.
See my fuel line inventory table at the top of this article:
