&gt;Boudin tube - I know that a boudin tube is a
&gt;flexible tube to guide a cable.  is there a Mr Boudin ou there in it's
history?

	Yes there was a Mr Boudin and I believe he was Knighted for inventing this
mechanical control device in the 18th century. Will have to look it up to
find the exact year.




&gt;Bendix spring - which keeps the starter pinion
&gt;from getting stuck in the flywheel after the
&gt;engine starts.  Named after the corporation?  

	I think Bendix Electric is the source on that one with their 'self starter'.
