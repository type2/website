Subject: Re: VW's and high current application's

&gt; i want to put one or two car stereo amplifier's in my  72 van( about
700-800
&gt; watts RMS total).....to my knowledge everytthing is stock......will
i be
&gt; hurting anything?

You mean other than your ears?  :)

(since it is sorta old), and is there a way i can hook up
&gt; another battery in case i drain it and relive strain?( i know i saw it
&gt; somewhere), and is puttint a new ?alternater?(right part)? in there
whould
&gt; provide enough current? keep in mind that the extra power will come
ni handy
&gt; here in minnesota's freezing winter morn's......

Your present generator or alternator will be sufficient, as you are
not going to be pulling the 800W continuously.

You can add a second battery for those extended high-decibel sessions,
 All you need is an isolation relay that is available at most any RV
store.  Don't let them talk you into a solid state isolator as these
can be more trouble than they are worth.  Run the stereo from the
isolated battery.

One last request:  Please don't camp near me!
