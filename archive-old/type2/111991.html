&gt; I picked up a couple of old Bus horns at a recent VW show.  They were
&gt; practically free, so what the heck, if they didn't work I could mess around (which I
&gt; am doing!) with them.  They are both 12 volt models from (I'm guessing here)
&gt; either a 68 or 69.
&gt; So I wired 'em up (directly to a DC converter) - no beep.  Then I opened each
&gt; of them up.  And now the questions.......

the DC converter might not have supplied enough current.  connect them to
your bus battery and see if they beep.

&gt; 1.  What are the points for?  Seems to me that pressing the horn button and
&gt; making a ground is all one needs.  So, just what do the points do?

The points make and break the circuit which makes the horn vibrate.  They
are initially closed.  When current passes through the horn, the
electromagent flexes the diaphragm, causing the points to open.  The
diaphragm springs back closing the points and the cycle repeats.

&gt; 2.  Basically a horn is just an electromagnet.  Right?  No moving parts
&gt; (other than the vibration of the diaphragm and the above mentioned points).  So, if
&gt; the points are cleaned why would I still get no beep?  And I reset them to a
&gt; gap of .008.

That would be the problem.  Horn points have to start closed or the horn
won't start to beep!  Apply voltage to the horn and screw the points in
until you get the beep you want.  You might consider ear protection and it
probably isn't a good idea to do this procedure at 3:00AM!
