Now I know ALOT more than I did about CB antennas. Also found a nice
antenna for my application.

They have something similar to what I'm interested in - called a cell phone
look alike antenna - but with the option of w/o the coiled antenna mast for
$30+something bucks. 

If this topic interests anybody read the technical pages. VERY informative.

Now I know why the CB Mom and Dad bought back in 1978 never worked -
gutterclamp antenna on a fiberglass topped Landcruiser - no ground.

Now I can 'time travel' some more - '78 Westy and the favorite '70s gadget
- the CB radio. 

Of course an easier solution for caravans is some of the handheld VHF
portables but I doubt different brands do well when a big group trys to mix
and match radios and still talk.

See ya - gotta go dig out the old radio and check the SWF tuning on my
magnet mount antenna!
