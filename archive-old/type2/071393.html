Listees...

    So today I went to my first VW show and it was excellent!!  I did notice 
one thing that I'd like the group to comment on.  (I hope I'm not out of line 
here.)

I don't mean to offend anyone and I know I'm generalizing here, but is it 
just me, or do certain types of people gravitate to either breadloafs or 
splits...
90% of the daily driver splits I saw, were driven by hippie types, where as 
older, more settled people drove bays...

Again, I'm curious what the list has noticed...Sorry if I offended anyone, 
and If this subject is out of line for this forum, let me know and we'll let 
it die...

Peace...
Claude..
