Subject: [T2] Compufire dwell - does it matter?

I've scanned the archives looking for an answer to this question and merely
came up with more vague questions and no definitive results.  When I
installed the Compufire points, my dwell was 68 degrees.  For various other
reasons (perhaps this as well), the engine didn't run well, and I have since
switched back to points and gotten the engine tuned reasonably (new plugs,
oil, rotor etc...).  I would like to put the e-points back in, and was
wondering if the high dwell is going to cause me troubles.  If it does
matter, is there a way to tune it?  Sounds like the 'air gap' method doesn't
work.

TIA,
Niall
