Subject: It still exists!

The hub cap and tour box are alive and well.  Me and a fellow club 
member are going down to pick it up Sunday and take it to Dubuque, IA 
where we will be meeting up with some vintagebus listees from Nebraska 
and doing the hand-off.  I thought you guys might like to know.
A trip report will most likely be posted on late sunday night or monday.

Isaiah
