Subject: re: [T2] propane tank awareness

I was wondering the same thing about these tanks, since in California now,
we have to swap out all of our old tanks for the new tanks with overflow
valves.  My propane tank on my Riviera has about a quarter tank, but I'm
going to have to get it filled pretty soon.

As for tapping the tanks, I don't think it's a good idea to try and add a
valve to a tank, it can really compromise the integrity of the tank itself.
I've been using CNG vehicles for years now, and the concepts are similar,
although LPG is stored at a much lower pressure (3600psi _at_ 70 degrees
Fahrenheit for CNG versus 100psi _at_ 70 degrees Fahrenheit for LPG).  Still,
100psi is a dangerous pressure that can rupture quite easily.

I'd look into tapping into your line behind the pressure regulator and
emergency shutoff valve.  My Riviera has a line that was intended for the
furnace teed off the line running to the stove, with a seperate shutoff for
both lines.  I've attached a hose to that furnace line, and I use it to run
any number of portable accessories, such as my Coleman stove, my catalytic
heater, or my big 10,000 BTU portable burner.  Much safer to leave the tank
intact, and run a line off the low pressure side of the plumbing.

Subject: [T2] propane tank awareness

&gt;anyone have the link to the site that says our westy propane tanks are
legit to fill?
&gt;- steve

Is someone saying they will not fill it? I just had the propane guys
test (soap)the valve, if we had bubles then there was  leaks and no
leaks and he filled away.
Best of luck
I do not mean to hijack your thread, but I have a question on this
topic. Has anyone considered a valve on the side of the tank to conect
to a longer hose to a cache cooker or a camp Lantern?
