Subject: Re: FutureTechInfo was: trip report

Herr Doktor-
                   ...on the other hand, how much is all this info worth 
when, instead of just
EZ-PASS, most/all major highways are drive by wire or some other 
chip-controlled sys-
tem? Think The Bus Depot is gonna carry plug-ins to retro-fit my '71 (whose 
only chip
still blinks 12-12-12- on the radio...) ?
                    My paranoid self sorta leans to the theory that &quot;they&quot; 
wanna get old cars
off the road and into perpetual payments...Witness the current stress on 
bringing old
cars into compliance with pollution specs. Even those that may be 
&quot;grandfathered&quot; out
already. NJ is pushing the rolling road type of inspection, currently, and 
unless you're
opting out for historic plates, chances are your vehicle will be required to 
update to
some (constantly higher), standard. Historic plates are exempt, but try and 
explain to
the police that you're on your way to a show on Monday mornings...
