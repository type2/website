You should check to see that the distributor drive gear is set correctly in 
the case.  It's been too long since I removed the drive dog from the bottom 
of a distributor so I can't remember if it's possible to install it 
improperly, but I'd guess if you *can* install it improperly that it'd be 
180 degrees out, nothing like 25 degrees.

Here's my guess: the distributor drive gear is set improperly.

&gt; Spent the afternoon killing my battery trying to get this _at_#$% van 
&gt; started.
&gt; Replaced distributor with a new rebuilt dizzy from Rock-auto, and a set of
&gt; hot-spark pointless points (that's for sure). Turns out the electronic
&gt; points are randomly misfiring at speed, getting worse until van dies. Swap
&gt; them with stock points and it still runs like crap although not misfiring
&gt; (can tell by timing light). Just can't get the timing set right. Yank the
&gt; new dizzy and the shaft seems misaligned - when I look at the notch for 
&gt; the
&gt; rotor and compare it to the engagement pawls at the bottom of the shaft, 
&gt; the
&gt; new dizzy is different by about 25 degrees. I can't set timing right 
&gt; because
&gt; the vacuum advance can hits the cold start valve. WTF? Am I expected to
&gt; change the relationship beween the camshaft and distributor or this a 
&gt; screw
&gt; up by the rebuilder?
