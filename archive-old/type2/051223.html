Subject: [T2] Coil or Electronic Ignition??

Thanks again to everyone who has been sending me excellent advice on my
ongoing bus problems.

I've tracked my problem down to either the coil or the MagFire
electronic ignition system.

(I could have sworn that I didn't have power to the coil the other day
but there is juice there now so I must have made a bad connection with
my meter)

Anyway, I have the MagFire electronic ignition system installed (more
than 6 months now) and it hasn't given me problems up to this point. I
checked the coil &amp; 'points' per the manual that I have. The following
are the results:

Points closed w/ ignition on (I had the electronic ignition connected
and ran a jumper from terminal 1 to terminal 15 - assuming this is
basically the same as having points closed).  Voltage from terminal 1 to
ground = 7v

Points open w/ ignition on (disconnected the electronic ignition from
the coil - assuming this was the same as having the points open)
Voltage from terminal 1 to ground = 10v

With the electronic ignition connected as is (don't know if the little
disc inside the distributor was aligned with the sensor or not) and the
ignition on.  Voltage from terminal 1 to ground = 1.2v

Voltage between terminal 1 and 15 with the ignition on = 6.4v

When I remove the center cable from the distributor and hold it 10mm or
so from the fan shroud and turn the starter I get no spark (at first I
got a very little one but now I have nothing).

I can't decide whether my problem is the coil or the electronic
ignition. I'm half tempted to order the Pertronix system with the high
output Flame Thrower coil and replace both.

Any advice??

Jason
