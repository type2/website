Subject: Re: [T2] More Corvair Bus Troubles W.V. (Transmission)

&gt; the engine going again.  I had thought it siezed but it did not - the

Ummm... Glen, if you mistook a dead battery for a seized engine, maybe you
aren't the guy to deal with a Corvair conversion. I know I wouldn't attempt
such a task. Even thouhg my father's first new car was a Corvair and I'd
have more help than I wanted, there's a reason you don't see many of these
on the road.

&gt; headlights on or it would have toasted it before the battery died.

Hmmmm... If the battery is dead and the engine is running - except for

Linkage! Linkage! Linkage! you've got at least four feet more linkage in the
bus than the Corvair originally had - and even then any linkage can suffer
bigtime from minor problems. New bushings, adjusting the linkage, etc, will
probably fix all your problems.
