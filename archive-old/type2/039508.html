Don,

You could get underneath above the transmission and remove the 
filter(pre-filter) if you have another inline one.  The pick-up and filter is 
all one piece.  The problem may lie on how large the debris in your tank 
is(i.e.-egg shells).  The opening is only about 1/2&quot;  in diameter.  You 
should be able to remove/replace the engine and tank in one afternoon or a 
one six-pack per person with two people(however you gauge time with 
projects).  While you are there you might want to consider treating and 
sealing the tank if necessary with either a &quot;POR&quot; or Eastwood product.  Also 
check your filler neck rubber hose and fuel lines at that time.  Personally I 
would prefer the R/R option even though is is more time consuming.  There is 
just something about being stuck on one of america's deserted highways with 
egg on my face and in my tank.  Of course this is only my opinion... I could 
be wrong.
