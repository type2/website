&gt; In order to reply to the Type 2 List (digest), I have to click on 
&gt; &quot;Reply All&quot;, then delete the address to &quot;digest-help.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I had my preferences set up to quote the original message in the reply 
&gt; (i.e., the entire digest).  Even though I would select and delete the 
&gt; entire message when replying, the mail would bounce for quoting too 
&gt; much.  When I set the preferences to NOT quote the original message, 
&gt; all was OK.

Although I am not in digest mode, I also run 10.3. I assume you use 
&quot;Mail&quot; to read mail. Rather than &quot;reply to all,&quot; I simply hit reply, 
then add &quot;type2_at_type2_dot_com&quot; on the &quot;to&quot; line (I actually type &quot;ty&quot; and 
the program fills in the rest automatically.) In some cases, I delete 
the individual's address (for instance, Erik Meltzer asks not to get 
two replies to his posts -- one direct, the other through the list).

Before doing this, though, in &quot;Mail&quot; you can highlight the part of a 
message that you want to quote before hitting &quot;reply.&quot; Only the 
selected text will appear as a quotation.
