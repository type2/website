Subject: Re: [T2] Brake/Idle relationship - how bizarre...

i would suspect a vaccum leak in the brake booster line somewhere or brake
booster ?

try plugging off the line up at the carb and then see what
happens.. although this will cause you to have a brake pedal as hard as stone
..... 

good luck
chai
Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go

Subject: [T2] Brake/Idle
relationship - how bizarre...

My son and I spent several hours yesterday
adjusting the idle on our 71 bus.
All seemed fine, but we noticed that when we
put the brake on hard (even
while standing still in neutral) the idle drops
down to the point of killing
it.  We checked to make sure that the throttle
cable was not being
interfered with and for the life of me can't see the
relationship between
the two.  We even went so far as to disconnect the brake
light indicators in
case it was having a short.  No luck with this...

Please
help!

Brian
