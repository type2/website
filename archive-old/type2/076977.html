&gt; Hiya All,
&gt; 
&gt; First off, I need to thank Joe over at Busted VW for his information 
&gt; concerning the Slider Hinge Link Assembly.
&gt; 
&gt; But now another question has popped up.  In talking to a boneyard mechanic 
&gt; about removing the sliding door hinge link assembly, he told me 
&gt; this.......................
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Don't follow the procedure in Bentley (remove door, remove body track cover, 
&gt; remove old and install new hinge) for replacing the hinge link.  Taking off 
&gt; the body track cover (the screws will be all rusted, etc, etc,) will just 
&gt; result in a ruined track cover.  And then I'll be left with hours of 
&gt; adjusting the door.  Instead, just jack up the slider slightly, undo the 
&gt; hinge bolts from the inside and slip the hinge link assembly back down the 
&gt; track and (manuevering it around a bit) take it out of the track at the track 
&gt; slot.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Whaddyathink guys?  This is my first time at this particular job.  I don't 
&gt; want to mess this up.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
