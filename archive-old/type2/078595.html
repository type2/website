Subject: The Altamaha Wilderness Adventure Challenge, AWAC

Hi folks,

I want to invite all you VW bus owners to an event my company, Three 
Rivers Expeditions, will be sponsoring Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

The first annual Altamaha Wilderness Adventure Challenge, &quot;AWAC&quot; for 
short, will happen May 25, 2002.

The AWAC will be an outdoor course challenge that will include 
canoeing/kayaking, mountain biking, and an obstacle course.  This is 
not a race!  teams of 3 or individuals can participate.  The course 
is being designed for folks that love good physical activity, but 
also know the value of sitting in a recliner.  You get my drift...

The entry fee for participants is $40.00.  We will be providing 
canoes (or you can bring your own), but you will need to furnish your 
own mountain bike.

We will provide a free low country boil for all particpants.  There 
will be bluegrass music and opportunities all weekend to paddle 3 
fine rivers for all who attend (rentals will be available at a 
discount to bus owners).  Camping is primitive (no electricity), but 
also free.

My business doesn't really allow me to venture off on weekends so I 
figured I would try to lure as many of you as possible to come where 
I live.  I would love to see lots of VW busses in attendance.  I 
actually miss you guys and gals.

South Georgia is a beautiful area and the AWAC is attracting lots of 
attention.  Should be lots of fun with lots of celebration.

Sorry about the lack of bus content but I just wanted to offer ya'll an invite.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford

PS:  Five years ago on January 12, the Mothership and I were on our 
way to Oklahoma City and into our third day of travel.  I was scared 
to death.  I still am.  : )
