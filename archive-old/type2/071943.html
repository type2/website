Use the blue loctite - the one which specifies bolts can be removed with
hand tools.  Don't use the one that requires heat to remove.

&gt;I'd err on the high side and use lube on

I'd use blue loctite (in the red tube).  Bart Simpson says loctite kicks
butt!   :)  I use it on lots of things including the type 4 flywheel bolts,
intake and exhaust studs, drive shaft bolts, and caliper bolts.  It is
wonderful stuff!  Anti sieze is good too - use it on things that come apart
more often or are subject to rust, like lug nuts and intake and exhaust
fasteners.
