Subject: Re: Engine Swap 

&gt;Does anyone know what would be required to swap a fuel injected motor into
&gt;a '74 bus?  I already have converted to an electric fuel pump, so putting
&gt;in a higher pressure pump isn't going to be a problem, but what else is
&gt;involved?
&gt;
&gt;I understand there is some kind of electronic equipment on the fuel
&gt;injected buses, is this difficult to wire into a bus originally equipped
&gt;with a carb?  I'd like to put in a motor, maybe a 2.0 from a later model
&gt;bus.  My carbs are dying, and I just like FI better anyway.
&gt;
Well, if you're talking about swapping a whole F.I. motor (as you say 
above), rather than converting your existing motor to F.I., I'd imagine the 
motor already has the F.I. intake manifold, air flow meter, F.I. harness, 
injectors, cold start valve, temp sensor, etc. attached.  You will also 
need the &quot;brain&quot; (ECU), which mounts in the right side &quot;wheel well&quot; section 
inside the engine compartment (although you could put it anywhere), and the 
dual relay and resistor pack, which screw to the &quot;firewall&quot; that goes 
between the engine compartment and the gas tank.  What I don't know is how 
you might have to modify the wiring harness that's actually part of the 
bus. If you have the '68-79 Bentley manual (and every bus owner should!), 
the F.I. section in the back should tell you everything you need.  Your 
best bet is probably to find a local junkyard with a '75-79 bus and just 
remove everything.  Otherwise, I have plenty of brains (huh?) and almost 
every other F.I. parts you might need, but I'm not sure if I have any spare 
dual relays or resister packs.

By the way, the air flow meters and &quot;brains&quot; have different part numbers 
for different years (and for auto vs. manual trans).  Some air flow meters 
(and therefore wiring harnesses) are six-pin and some are seven-pin.  For 
simplicity's sake it might be easier to use ones with the same number of 
pins, but other than that I have found different air flow meters to be 
interchangeable as far as practical use goes.  Similarly, later &quot;brains&quot; 
will have more pins, but I've used them with earlier harnesses that took 
fewer pins, and, so far, not run into any differences that were noticable 
on the road (my experience is primarily with manual trans buses).  

Another option is to convert the F.I. motor to carb (use your existing 
intake manifolds and rebuild your carbs).  Might be easier, although I 
personally much prefer the F.I. to the carb setup if you want to go to the 
trouble.
