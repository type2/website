Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition barrell sticking

Hiya Karl,

&quot;On a bay bus, the drill-the-hole-trick came on later buses.
The above instructions apply to 68 to 74 buses.
Drill-the-hole applies to 75 to 79 buses.
Bentley, section 4, pages 24-25.&quot;

The instructions for ignition housing removal will not apply to a 1970 model 
which uses the 211 905 887A ignition housing.  This may be a one year only 
part.  I have yet to find any documentation on this part or its servicing.  Yet 
in every 1970 bus I've checked (nine so far and that includes a single cab) 
I've found the 887A housing.
