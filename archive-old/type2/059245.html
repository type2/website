Subject: Re: oil filter location on '71 bus

&gt; Hope this hasn't been beaten to death, but can
&gt; someone advise on where they put the oil filter on a
&gt; '71 bus?

Wherever you attach the filter mount, be sure that the filter is
upright so that you can fill the filter with oil when changing oil and
filter.  If you can't do this, your engine runs without oil pressure
until the filter is filled.
