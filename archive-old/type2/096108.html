&gt; I believe that the synthetic technology has come a long way, and I do

&gt; 
&gt; Way back when--I worked at a motorcycle shop--and besides the English
&gt; bikes we sold Yamaha's, and they had oil injection.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon dumping a quart of synthetic oil into their oil tank, they soon
&gt; found that their engine was toast, due to a locked up oil pump, and all
&gt; kinds of nasty jelloey substance in their automatic oiling system.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if this would be a good idea in a Bus's life to be changing
&gt; lanes midstream--
&gt; I sure wouldn't recommend it--
&gt; 
well buses don't have oil injection.

Any change from dino to syn should be done at a full oil change (and
filter if have one)

I have run synthetics for many years,  when we tore  down my 2 liter for
rebuild around 183k, unknown lubes for 114k synthetic for last 69k we
found the engine to be in remarkably clean condition and very little
unusual wear.  rebuilt to spec and ran good quality single weight dino for
break in and synthetic ever since, still not a drop of oil used between
changes.  added about another 60k to it since rebuild. still appears to be
quite clean, change oil at about 4k change filter on every oil change.

&gt; I know we were talking about viscosity here but this site is very
&gt; informative. I would trust the opinions of a Chemist from a proper Oil
&gt; Company. There is one tidbit of information that I found very
&gt; interesting.
&gt; &quot;Synthetic Oil has 10% better heat transfer than Petrolium based
&gt; lubricants&quot;

I have temp guage and did a little test right before change from dino to
synthetic after breakin and I found the difference in temps to be
statistically insignificant... syth was maybe a little cooler but could be
explained away by too many other variables and it wasn't much anyway

however cold weather starting was a noticable improvement, it cranks
almost like 70F when it is 20F
