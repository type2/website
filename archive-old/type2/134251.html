Subject: Oil pressure WAAAAAAY too high

Volks,
I have a 1600 DP, deep sump, and an O'berg oil filter.
Everything was fine for an early February ride in Ohio at 45*..change the oil,
blow out the O'berg filter, replace all, and now the oil pressure is off the
gauge.
Oil level seems fine, at the line.
I am thinking this is a concern.  What do I look for?

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
