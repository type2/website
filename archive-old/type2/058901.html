 Hi,
        Don't panic yet... (maybe later :-).

 Depending on the nature of your rattle this could just be a timing problem.
 Your lack of low-end pull and rattling at WOT sound to me like a symptom of overadvanced timing. Check your points (dwell &amp; timing) before
getting too depressed.
 I wouldn't run 10W30, though. You don't need a thin oil in an aircooled VW and a thicker base
is less likely to break down. I use a straight 30 weight oil but a good quality 20W50 is also
recommended by some.
 The main message seems to be to avoid &quot;cheap&quot; oil and to change it often: most folk who've voiced an opinion seem to go for
1500-3000 miles between changes, some claim less!

Cheers.

&gt; I have a problem ...
&gt; 					...the engine
&gt; was doggin out and if I pushed the eccellerator (sp??) down I heard a
&gt; &quot;rattle&quot; from the engine ... not bad but noticeable.  ...There was puffs
&gt; of white smoke coming out of the oil breather, but the engine sounded fine
&gt; while idling.
&gt; ....  BTW this oil was 10w30 and had about 1000 miles on it by the time
&gt; this happened.
&gt; What do you guys think is my problem and what can I do to test the theories.
