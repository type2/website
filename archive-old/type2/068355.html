&gt;Hi Emily,
&gt;
&gt;If only I were an expert...  On my '71 T-2 I use what's commonly
&gt;known as the &quot;bug type&quot; muffler - two small straight pipes.  It runs
&gt;pretty quiet (now that I fixed that small crack in it).  The &quot;J&quot; type
&gt;of tailpipe seems to run quiet as well, the ones I've heard anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Other measures can be taken to help it be quiet.  Since you have a
&gt;Westy, that's a big plus interior-wise.  I think posing the question
&gt;to the list would get you some more info.  Also, near the beach, you
&gt;may want to look into some kind of coating protection that'll keep
&gt;the salt air from harming the new one.  
&gt;
&gt;I like my bus engine to sound like a sewing machine !

&gt;&gt;You're singing my song, Brother!   Since I agree with you wholeheartedly 
&gt;&gt;about sound level from the exhaust I would like to ask your advice.  Our '69 
&gt;&gt;Westy is in sore need of a new exhaust (the whole shebang - a muffler alone 
&gt;&gt;ain't gonna cut it) - soon.  We just got our registration bill in the mail 
&gt;&gt;and it's smog time.  We passed very easily last time, but the exhaust has 
&gt;&gt;turned to cheese since then (we moved about 100 yards from the ocean).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I need to get an order in, probably to RMMW, by next week.  We were thinking 
&gt;&gt;about the Quiet Packs, but apparently they aren't so quiet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance for your advice.  I love the sound of our bus, not some 
&gt;&gt;popping and cracking glass-packs.

&gt;&gt;I like to hear what my passenger says.  I like to be able to hear
&gt;&gt;music without additional background noise.  I like to NOT disturb
&gt;&gt;my neighbors.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nothing sounds as sweet to me, nor smells so nice as a very beautifully
&gt;&gt;tuned VW engine...running as quiet as possible.  The &quot;expensive&quot; noises
&gt;&gt;are plenty loud enough for me, thank you.
