&gt; I have been trying to set my timing on my 69, the books show three marks. Two

&gt; All of which I have. The books say the mark I should use is the one that
&gt; stands alone, but I do the timing seems way off.  I am using wrong marks?  Is the
&gt; possible the pulley is marked wrong.

It's certainly possible that the pulley isn't the right one, after 35
years!

However, it sounds like your pulley is the common one with a lone notch
for TDC and two notches to the right of the lone notch for 5 degrees BTDC
and 7.5 degrees BTDC.  The notch you use depends upon the distributor
you are running.  With most earlier distributors you use the 7.5 degree
notch, but don't depend upon this info for tuning your engine!  Be sure!
