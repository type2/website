Subject: Fuel Line Questions,
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello agin, I have some fuel line questions, 1. Can I
buy replacemnt ruber hoses for my fuel lines and the
rubber  parts in between the fuel rails on my fuel
injected 81 Vanagon, 2 I suspect that my wireing or
control for my fuel pump is shot with the Key on and
in ther start positution I have now fuel pressures, so
I diconected the wires to the pump and temporaly hot
wired it to the battery the pump work fine UI checked
buy taking the pressure bolt out of the line and
hocked it up, spray gas all over the place. Is it safe
for me to Hook up a switch and hot wire the fuel pump.
3. I am also not getting the engin to fire, could all
4 fuel injectors could be cloged I changed the fuel
filter today and took it apart and it was full of
sludge. Ive held the coil wire in one hand and triped
the points on the disturater and got a pretty good
shock.  I cant figure it out Can some one help me.
