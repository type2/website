Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

&gt; Comments on this?  Better breathing with this cam should have meant

Not necessarily.  I would guess better breathing = worse cooling. 
Reasoning is that better breathing leads to more A/F ingested which 
leads to more hp/torque which, without an increase in thermal efficiency 
would put a greater burden on the stock cooling system.

&gt; Now I am thinking of going to big valve (42 X 36) heads with the stock 
&gt; cam.  Is this a better idea for a few more HP?

Hard to say.  It would likely reduce low-end torque and *might* make up 
for it on the top end with more hp.  However, the engineers that 
originally designed the engine understood these relationships fairly 
well and I doubt they left much on the table without some tradeoff, such 
as reliability.

If I wanted a small increase in power in the most reliable way, I would 
go for a bump in compression ratio and use higher octane gasoline. 
Contrary to popular belief, a higher compression ratio will increase 
thermal efficiency and should not make an engine run hotter, provided 
detonation is kept under control.

At the risk of starting up a subject that some people find offensive, 
water injection is a common method of controlling detonation in engines 
with high compression ratios.  But higher octane gas will work too.  :-)
