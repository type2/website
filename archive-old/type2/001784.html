&gt;Tell me a quick and easy way to get out one of the bolts that I broke off
trying to put back on  my muffler.  I have about 2-3 inches of the bolt
left, vice grips don't seem to work.
&gt;Thanks, Bob


Bob, MIG weld a nut to the bolt stub.  Then, blast the thing with
penetrating oil and  let it soak.  Then try to turn it.  I presume it is a
steel stud going into an aluminum head, so you can't use a torch to heat the
surrounding metal, at least not directly.

You could try very gently heating the stud itself, maybe with a steel baffle
to keep the heat away from the aluminum.  Only try that as a last resort, I
think.  Aluminum does not give you warning signs like steel or iron when it
is about to melt.  It just turns to mush all of a sudden, and you're dead.

Regards,

Grant
