Subject: good sign (Eureka Springs Show)

Today a sign came down to tell me it was going to be a good day. I saw two otherbuses in Lil Rock that were the same color as mine in a thirty minute span on 
the interstate. Good sign.
Also what are the dates for the Eureka Springs show? It may have been given out
once before but I overlooked it.

On the subject of stickers my favorite one is one that can be applied to 
deadheads and VWers everywhere simply stated it says &quot;We are everywhere&quot; and is shrined with black and white roses. Another one is &quot;Speak up for Liberty&quot;.
