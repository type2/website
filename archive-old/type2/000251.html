Subject: gauge sending unit fix
Date: Thu, 4 Mar 1999 21:02:09 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I broke the wire in my 71 fuel sending unit.  This is the fine wire that the
float slides past.  I think I could manage soldering a new one on, but don't
have a clue as to the spec on it.  Does anyone know?  Have a source?

OK, does anyone have a unit they'd sell me?  I know RMMW sells them, but it
seems like a lot.  Especially when I've got 95% of the unit in hand.
