Subject: Engine installed...

Hey all,
Another update.

Yesterday I finished assembling my engine with new AVP heads.  This 
evening Steve Dolan came over to help with the install.  Us two plus my 
dad and brother were able to move that engine around with no problems.  
We got it up on the jack, got everything into place, and had a 
remarkably easy time getting the engine and the transmission mated.  
Then we had a further remarkably easy time getting the bolts up through 
the bearer bar and through the van's frame.  This all went quite well.  
Steve and I spent the next 2.5 hours hooking up all the ancillaries and 
tightening everything up.  Around 11 we finally finished, and arrived 
the MOMENT OF TRUTH.

Key in hand, I confidently stepped toward the driver's door, opened it, 
watched the dome light NOT come on and I had an epiphany!!  &quot;THE 
BATTERY!&quot; I exclaimed.  

Well after hooking up the battery I again walked confidently to the 
driver's door, opened it, watched the dome light come on :-) -- inserted 
the key, turned it to &quot;on&quot; -- &quot;we have warning lights&quot; says I.  Then I 
go to &quot;start&quot;  RrRrRrRr.  Stop.  No gas in the fuel lines, I remember, I 
figured it would take some extra cranking to get going this first time.  
Do it again, RrRrRrRrrrVROOOMMMPUTTPUTTPUTTPUTT.  &quot;Hmm&quot; I say, &quot;Is that 
a lifter or is that exhaust?&quot;  Sounded a bit loud and explosive-like to 
be a lifter.  I do a quick walk-around and sure enough, I find an 
exhaust leak between the left side heat exchanger and head.  So I shut 
it down, I will leave that for tomorrow.  I probably just have the damn 
exchanger cocked on the mounting studs or something.  

But the engine is in, and it started and ran on its own :-) -- yeehaw!  
Tomorrow I will pull that heat exchanger and check it out.  Once I get 
the exhaust leak fixed I will drive it and then do a compression test.  
I'll keep you all posted.
