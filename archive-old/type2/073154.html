2 busses, both in Dayton Ohio. Both would probably need to be
towed.

1- A 72 Adventurewagen high-top camper. Front dented in, top front
lightly crushed in parking garage. This was brought in from out
west, and has 99% of the rust is surface rust; the only places
rusted through are the standard battery tray and floorboards under
the driver and passenger seat. Mechanics are great- really only
needs a new clutch- it starts slipping in forth gear. Headlights
need rewiring. Other then that it runs well and is really solid.
$200 (all white, black interior)

2- An 85 weekender vanagon. The rods started knocking, so it
has been parked since that became noticible. Solid, clean body,
decent interior with no rips or tears. New brakes, water pump, 
catalytic converter, clutch cylinders in the last two years. 
$300 (the grey-blue with grey strip in mid-body, same
color interior)

Prices are negotiable. I just want to make sure they go to a good
home. :) So, if you are interested, ask...  I would like
to get them out before the end of the month. I'm going to 
be concentrating on my 77 bay window...
