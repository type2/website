&gt; Well, you take your personal rustbucket (talking as a northerrner here) and
&gt; remove the dash serial number and ID sticker behind seat.   Switch to no
&gt; title bus BODY....if ambitious, remove the engine compartment number (gotta
&gt; cut it out) and weld it.   Or grind/repaint the &quot;new bus&quot; serial # off and
&gt; play dumb.  nO ONE CHECKS IT HERE.   Repaint the bus as desired.   That's
&gt; why one keeps the numbers and clean title off of parted out busses also!!
&gt;      If I lived closer I'd be tempted.     MB

Mike:
Well, that's the quick and dirty way, but also a good way to get in a
heap of trouble, too. I'd guess that Florida has a way for the salvage
dealer to get a title for the vehicle. I'd call the state DMV and talk
to them first, maybe the prchaser can do all the legwork and just get
the seller to sign the appropriate forms? Lots less worry when crossing
borders, etc.
