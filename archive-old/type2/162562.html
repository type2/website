&gt; That debate is solved in my state.  If your car is 75
&gt; or newer, it can't be EMISSIONS modified and still
&gt; pass the emissions tests.  Unless of course they don't
&gt; look carefully during the inspections every other
&gt; year.  :D

my 78 gets inspected but they have never even looked at the engine, they
stick the prob up the tailpipe and it passes or it doesn't   they do check
the gas cap though
