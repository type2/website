Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Valve and Rod job... I think.

Nah I know what Whitworth fasteners are I believe but never seen any that I 
can recall.

Those couple British cars had normal hardware the best I could remember - 
been a while.

'67 Austin Healey 3000 and '59 (?) MGA with parts car.

Never let a concrete block wall fall on your parts car - not much left and 
sort of discouraging. We did salvage the drivetrain and some of the dash. 
The rest was scrap.
