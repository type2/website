Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

Being a teacher, I know of a number of districts who offer &quot;Virtual 
School&quot; where all the lessons are online.  Tests are taken at testing 
centers around the US.  Districts have gone to this in order to 
insure students in their district who they are still responsible for 
even if they are home schooled will pass proficiency exams and No 
Child Left Behind.

Get a WiFi connection, or better yet, just use your cell phone as a 
modem and you could educate your kids anywhere in the US on the road 
in your bus from your home school district!!


&gt;is it possible to live out of your bus and be on the road etc and 
&gt;have kids...?
&gt;   curious if anyone has done this?
&gt;   or doing this..?
&gt;
&gt;   i know theres  homeschooling but can this be done... the whole concept?
