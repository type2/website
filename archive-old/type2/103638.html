&lt;&lt; I think if I can't fix my bus, I'm going to totally go nuts on it. I'll 
paint it bright yellow, make a periscope out of PVC piping and write &quot;We 
all live in a yellow submarine...&quot; on the side.

And then I'll hang out in it every night and have an extension cord going 
into to the house so I can power my fan, stereo, etc. inside the 
bus.  Then, after I'm nice and tired of it, I'll take out the engine and 
crap and turn it into a garden.  Haha.

You're copping the story board from the strip &quot;Zits&quot;, y'know...;-)
