Subject: blower fans  &amp; frosty carbs

I have been running a bilge blower fan for
about 6? years or so and I am on my second one.
the first ate a rock and started making interesting
noises. 
  I mount the fan as far forward as possible. I have
people ask me to please turn down the heat. ;-) 
 Granted It isnt sub zero weather out here in the
PACNW but it gets nippy enough and it is kinda sorta
damp.
  I also use the black sewer pipe to span the length
under the bus. First time I did that I insulated it
and it sagged. replaced it with no insulation and
havent had a problem. I did wrap the blower with
rubber
from a old tire tube to cut down the noise and to help
keep water from getting into it.
  Note this is black ABS not PVC pipe. Whatever
results you have had.. this has worked well for me..
if a fan eats itself every 3 years... I would by
another at 16 to 18 bucks... well worth it.

----White frosty carbs:
On my 74 if the rubber seal around the tin works
loose.. this being on the preheater tube.. I have
icing problems which causes a bucking on acceleration.
Even on warmer days. You might check your preheater
tube and make sure it is seated well and the seals are
in place... just a thought.
