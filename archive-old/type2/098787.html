&gt; Got my oil cooler reinstalled, and the bus back together, and got it

&gt; wack at 85! I have double checked the compufire, and tried it both with 
&gt; and without the shim beneath the compufire rotor, with very little 
&gt; change. Is there any way to adjust the dwell on this thing, or should I 
&gt; just go back to points? Please help, as we are planning to leave for 
&gt; oregon tonight, and I have to get it going right.

Is the bus running ok? I have a Pertronix unit that usually shows ~55
degrees, so (like you suspect) 85 is right out. I would double check
that the dwell meter is hooked up correctly &amp; has a good ground. Other
than that, if you need to leave soon just put a set of points in &amp; run
with it. There is sure nothing wrong with running them, the elec units
just seem to be a nice improvement.
