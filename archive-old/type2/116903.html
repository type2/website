Subject: Re: [T2] Painter's photos

Richard,

Wow, thanks for sharing those pictures.  Your bus looks Great!  I'm sure
that I'm not the only bus owner who didn't spend a few minutes dreaming of
having my bus look as good as this.  Now if only my bank account could
accommodate it.  Congratulations on doing the job right.

&gt; My painter was kind enough to send me a CD of photos he took documenting
&gt; some of the work done to my bus and some of the rust I didn't get to see.
&gt;
&gt; It was pretty scary to see major rust behind the rear valance on a bus
that
&gt; has only seen four winter snows. There are some good shots of the rusted
&gt; windshield area also.
