Subject: Re: [T2] yet another FART...Glossy Side Up or Down?

Maybe. Maybe not. Just checked the new seal sitting in front of me by 
throwing it in the bathtub, filling it with H2O, and even squeezing it while 
holding it under same. Closed cell foam. It also floats. Nada on the water 
retention. Any other thoughts?
