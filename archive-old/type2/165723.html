&gt; can we confirm that Oils are being reformulated

That's what the virgin oil analysis tests indicate. I think there  
maybe some merit to the existence of a problem for &quot;classic cars&quot;  
because SL formulas are re-appearing alongside the SM formulas or it  
could just be marketing again.

For example, Mobil 1 has recently introduced a line of SL based oils  
(with the typical seal swelling agents found in other high mileage  
oils). I've seen them on the shelf at Autozone already:

http://www.mobil1_dot_com/USA-English/MotorOil/Oils/ 
Mobil_1_High_Mileage_10W-40.aspx

There's no 5w50, 15w50 or 20w50 weights yet.

It should be noted that while the ZDDP levels in this oil are  
slightly better than the SM oils they still lower than the older SL  
formulas.

I'm surprised none of the major oil companies have marketed an oil  
specifically for &quot;classic cars without catalytic converters&quot;. Perhaps  
they are afraid to show how their current oils do or don't cause  
failures. :-)

&gt; ,, and that the new oil will
&gt; NOT be good for aircooled V  W engine tappets and camshafts?
&gt; there is a link to more reading.. http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/ 
&gt; oil.html

I wouldn't put a lot of faith in the recommendations presented there.

In the beginning that webpage had a growing list of oil test results  
but over time it has been modified to support the conclusions and  
therefore is not very scientific in my mind. E.g. Swepco oils came  
highly recommended (and indeed were sold by the same person writing  
the article) but those oils failed to meet the same Zn/P minimums as  
stated near the top of the article in some tests. That data has since  
disappeared from the results all together so what does that say?

To be fair the author does make it clear that the conclusions are  
solely based on the spectrographic findings of virgin oil analysis  
rather than actual engine tests.

When someone demonstrates a premature camshaft failure with an  
average off the shelf SM rated oil, repeats the results in a second  
test, then prevents failure in a 3rd and 4th test by increasing the  
ZDDP levels, I'll be convinced.
