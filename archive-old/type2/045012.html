Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found a 2L I  
 think?

I have two GD engines, both for a 76 2.0 FI.  They both use the
L-Jetronic system.  There is a difference though.  On the Pre-Feb '76
the AFM has an integrated temp sensor I and has 6 pins on the
connector.  On the post-feb 76 there is a separate temp sensor I (still
in the AFM) and there are 7 pins on the connector.

I have a question for everyone: I've messed up my AFM royally so I want
to know if I can exhange the following parts from my post feb onto my
pre feb (the pre feb is the one that's f'd up):

ECU
AFM
Wiring harness
Throttle housing (microswitch changes)
(EGR's already closed off)

Is there anything else that changes within the 76 model year?  From what
I know, those blocks are identical except for the few minor electrical
changes.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; &gt;Hi John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I forgot to tell you in the email.  A shop sold me what they identified as a 75
&gt; &gt;1800.  The engine serial # prefix of GD identified it as a 2.0L, Lucky me.  If
&gt; &gt;the prefix on the 75 is an AW or ED, it is an 1800.  GD and GEs are 2.0L.  If
&gt; &gt;you have the computer which came with the engine, it should work.  In my humble
&gt; &gt;opinion, since the computer senses basically mass air flow, head temp, and
&gt; &gt;ambient air temp, I submit the computer will properly adjust to a proper
&gt; &gt;mixture.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll go a step farther and say that motors with a mass-air sensor will adjust to displacement as well.  The only problem you will run into is that with a larger displacement, you could run past the operating range of the mass-air meter and/or computer at very high RPM.  The L-Jetronic is mass-air (L for luft (air), right?) and the D-Jetronic is MAP (d=drueck (pressure), uses manifold vacuum to meter fuel).  Any bus with L-Jetronic should adjust very well to displacement changes, while those with D-Jetronic would run lean with a larger than stock displacement.  I can never remember which years came with which system.
