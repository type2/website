My vote would be to replace the sender. Gauges dont develop
&quot;bad spots&quot; they generally just stop working or always
indicate the wrong values as their calibration is out of
wack or they are damaged Oooorrr they are getting the wrong
 voltage from the sender (or no voltage).

&lt;snip&gt;

I have a question about the fuel gauge in my 79 Westy.
.......
Does anyone know if it's the gauge or the sender? Thanks...

Television - a medium. So called because it is neither rare nor well-done.
