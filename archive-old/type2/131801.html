Subject: RE: [T2] Rear/side window installation

&gt;From: &quot;Dave C. Bolen&quot; When I did my 78 Champagne edition, all of my glass 
&gt;to body seals came
&gt;from west coast.  All of them but one went back in beautifully...except
&gt;for the window from hell.
&gt;Drivers side middle window with 50/50 sliders....I finally realized that 
&gt;the window opening was****too small****  !!!!
&gt;Yes, the window came out of there.  I burned 3 seals trying to get it to
&gt;fit until I actually measured it against the window with the seal on it.
&gt;At *least* 1/4&quot; to 3/8&quot; too small of an opening vertically!  I bit the
&gt;bullet, got out my air nibler, wrapped it carefully in a soft cloth(bus
&gt;was already painted) and nibbled away.
&gt;The next try was a winner!  The glass went in, but not very easily and I
&gt;didn't tear the seal.
&gt;My only conclusion was that maybe the factory made the opening too small,
&gt;and might have had some sort of special seal for it.  I couldn't measure
&gt;the others as they were already in and done.
&gt;Obviously, YMMV, not so obviously, really look everything over again...


I know someone else that had this problem, too. Paging Mr. Brown...Mr. Brown 
please answer the courtesy phone. IIRC the problem was the seal or maybe the 
glass...well maybe the bus. I don't remember, but he did order a new seal or 
glass and never cut the bus.

The seals I spoke of earlier that I installed were from Bus Depot. The ones 
I previously installed in my bus were Bus Depot as well. I have not had a 
problem with them yet. The first ones I installed I did by myself. Well me 
and my little partner

To date I have had no problems out of the seals except one. The seam of the 
seal some how ended up right in the corner of the window and is now cracking 
I see a split in the future, I guess this is my own fault and I can not 
blame Bus Depot, but it is not getting wet in the bus and it is doing it's 
job.
