Subject: More ??? on making HP, cooling, and towing

I'm finally getting ready to put China Cat, a 75 Westy, on the road. 
Initially, I'm going to use the standard 1.8L FI, but plan to build a 
larger engine for extended use, including towing an 800 lb boat/trlr.

I live in East TN, where temps rarely exceed 95*F, bot would contemplate 
towing to the midwest or TX, so am planning for 100*F, and this on 
flatter ground.

When I first contemplated this project 3-4 yrs. ago, I remember reading 
on a website an article on how much HP the cooling system could 
dissipate with varying degrees of reliability. I can't find the website 
again, and I am not *that* certain if my description is accurate. 
Anyhow, anyone know of such a website?

Then, I would appreciate any experienced opinions from the list. I have 
a set of 98mm p&amp;C, which I think gives 2.2L on a 2.0L crank, though it 
has been a while since I didn the calcs, so tha might be wrong.

Anyhow, I'd like to know how much HP can be gotten rid of by the 
standard cooling system, in a well-built engine. I wouldn't contemplate 
turbocharging, but might consider any normal procedures to increase 
BMEP, including a special (hydraulic) cam, Megaspuirt and larger 
injectors if needed, etc.

Then, if I decided to buy an aftermarket cooling system (Raby, etc.) how 
much HP could I get rid of ? In both cases, I'd expect 100K miles of 
reliable operation (proper maintenance assumed) to make it worthwhile, 
so I am not looking for a hotrod.

Any links or pointers to informative websites is appreciated. If the 
list thinks this question should be asked on Type$um, I'll post it there.

Cheers/The Fader
