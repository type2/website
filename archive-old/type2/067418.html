Subject: Post Election Clean-up (no VW)

With the impending US elections coming up next Tuesday, we all have 
an *opportunity* to perform a vital civic duty.  After the election, 
there are LOTS of election signs and posters on our public right of 
ways.  In California, the contenders and their followers are obligated 
to remove said signs within 10 days of the election or they will be 
removed by the Dept of Transportation and be billed for costs of 
removal.  You can do your part to help the losers and winners of 
political races by assisting in the cleanup of the painted plywood 
and 2x4 signs and plastic cardboard for proper re-use or recycling.
