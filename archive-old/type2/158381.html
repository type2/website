Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] (Starting) Electrical Problem ('71 Camper)

Greetings,

I don't hear the solenoid pop at all (and as I'm new to Campers/Buses, I'm
guessing that the sound would be loud enough to be &quot;obvious&quot;).  Is it
possible that with the headlights always on, even during cranking, that a
weak battery wouldn't be able to activate the solenoid?

I have not bridged the solenoid terminals -- sounds like a great test.  Why
didn't I think of that?  Oh well, thank goodness for this group.  Also, I
haven't tried the push start yet.

Regards,
David

&gt; Greetings Group,
&gt;
&gt; I have a '71 Camper with an unusual electrical problem.  Sometimes it will
&gt; start, sometimes it won't.  Here are some details:
&gt;
when it doesn't start can you hear the solenoid pop when you turn the
key?  have you bridged the terminals on the solenoid to see if the
starter whirls to life (be in neutral and don't run over yourself)?
Will it push start?
