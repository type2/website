Man, I hate to re-do things three times, especially when you put in all the
flaps and thermostat stuff and the Alternator doesn't fit properly in the
fan housing :)

  This is the backing plate.  The newer repro parts have a grove pressed
into the plate.  What is the purpose of this groove?  Is it important to
have on an Alternator?  Does it impact the fan to housing fit in any way?

  Why does the newer repo part have a small hole?  If this part is used,
should you plug this hole if it isn't used for (whatever?) intended purpose.

And one more really stupid question:

  When you install the backing plate, there is some type of vent hole in the
backing plate.  Does this point down (at the case)?

Hope someone can help me with these fool-generated questions.

Thanks,
