Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

Jeff,

yes, there are a few one-year-only parts, but nothing that should 
really hold you back from keeping the bus on the road.

it would be nice to have an upper access hatch to the engine, but since 
you are experienced with busses, you will no doubt find a way to get at 
whatever you need to.

don't let the fact that it is a '72 keep you from purchasing it. 
evaluate its condition as you would any other vehicle.

HTH,
