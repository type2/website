Subject: [T2] In Fresno, Calif wrecking yard:

Today I found a 78 deluxe Westy, Dakota beige w/brown plaid. Almost
complete....  Anybody need anything? [the tables, child cot/bars, and
propane tank are gone]

Also a 83 Vanagon Westy, almost complete. Missing both tables and upper
mattress's. [it is a waterboxer] All the white w/brown trim cabinets are
there, including the fridge.
