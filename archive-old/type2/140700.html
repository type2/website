Subject: Re: [T2] wont idle cold

Yes, I have an idea. Why are you driving a California bus in New York in the 
winter? I give it two years to scrap. The salt is going to eat it like it 
eats ice, with zero resistance to corrosion like all the other million buses 
that rusted out.
Last summer I circled Lake Ontario in my bus. I saw two other aircooled VW 
buses, both of them within 50 miles of home.  When I was in Syracuse area 
gassing up, some people came up to me freaking out, that they hadn't seen 
one of these buses for ages...they are rare and getting rarer and winter 
driving a good bus is a big mistake.

until I install the new(used) engine in my Jeep
wrangler to use as my winter car I have been driving
my 77 westy. This car came to NY from Ca last spring,
it is its 1st time in cold weather, and since it has
gotten very cold it wont idle when cold, if I drive it
for 10 minutes, then it will idle. any ideas?

thanks
