Subject: Re: [T2] replacement tin screws

When I replaced mine I also went down the SS bolt route. What I did find was
hex heads were about 1/2 the price of socket head caps and an added bonus was
the bearing surface was a little larger to give more support on the tin (I
still used washers). Only a couple of places they did not fit like in the
recessed hole on the fan housing.
It's good to note the installation torque because SS is harder than the tin
nuts so will strip them easily.
While your at it get some brass nuts for the exhaust studs and some &quot;star&quot; SS
washers.
Regards,
Richard
