you could do that,but a quicker/non-machine way of doing this is to use 
a sandwich type adaptor, it screws on like a filter but has an in and 
out outlate. I have seen these but I have not used one, any one used one 
of these. the reason i like it is that if you have a problem with the 
cooler/line you could just spin it off and you could contain the 
problem.   lano
