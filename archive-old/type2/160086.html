Subject: Dual Port Cylinder Head bolts question

I just spent the weekend building a 1600cc dual port...I picked up a beetle
motor to use for parts.

Ran into a snag, the cylinder head nuts/bolts are smaller due to case
savers, yet the bus case I am putting the heads on doesn't have the small
bolts ( or the original nuts/heads )

What size are the cylinder head nuts from a non-casesaver case, need to go
buy some tommorow.

My bus will live yet!
