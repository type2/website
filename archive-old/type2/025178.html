i want to thank everyone for the help with my bus.  last night i went home
and put the carberator back on the bus and checked the points.  the seemed
to be ok.  when i put everything back on and tried to start the bus i
couldn't get it to start.  it tries, but dies when the key is not turned.
so now i need to get it running and then get power back.  i am going to try
and get it running tonigt.  thanks again for all the help. - rawls
