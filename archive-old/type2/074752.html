Subject: Special Order (SO-XX) Interiors

Volks -

I am now enlightened as to what does/doesn't/could/might constitute a 
Campmobile/Westy/Etc. Excellent write-ups, BTW.

My '69 Westy has an &quot;SO-67&quot; plate on the rear seat. According to the 
archives, I should have a &quot;B67&quot; M-Code, but my bus is not with me at the 
moment to check. I've Googled my way to a dead-end.

Does anybody know what's so &quot;special&quot; about an SO-67 interior?

Mike &amp; Itch
