Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] *Long distance drivers arrive for OCTO!...


I would say so....after reading the *long* article on oil filters that has 
been posted several times, I wouldn't buy a fram for anything but a 
temporary fix.

I have blown one out also.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; As they were driving off, I noticed a
&gt; &gt; puddle that didn't look like rain water, and when Dan checked it, it was
&gt; &gt; oil that his filter had spit out! The Fram's gasket had crimped, and he
&gt; &gt; was pouring out oil! Fortunately I had a Bosch oil filter, (Thanks Bus
&gt; &gt; Depot!) Dan installed it, with a quart of Valvoline (thanks Lou) and
&gt; &gt; they were on their way.
