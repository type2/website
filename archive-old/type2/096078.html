&gt; Here we go AGAIN!!   185/75R14 are the WRONG size. The correct tire size DOES

there is more than one correct answer.   

When my van was built most of the tires and the technology did not even
exist.    the current crop of tires include many that can and will work
correctly.    I bought a 71 bus right from the dealer and it didn't have
185/14 tires on it.. Radials were approved for the bus (heck I had
michelins on my 60 when I got it...)

the key is to get the correct weight rating and make sure it fits.
