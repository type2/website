Subject: Re: [T2] Heater boxes...

&gt;I've got a pair of &quot;nice&quot; used heat exchangers (2L) that I'm gonna put
&gt;on my bus...Any thoughts on a paint/coating/incantation to use on
&gt;the sheet metal (inside and out, if possible) to make 'em last as long
&gt;as I'd like 'em to...?-(

I sandbalsted mine, then sprayed them with Bar-b-que paint. Didn't last.

I heard that brush on high temp paint is better than spray paint.

Cure the paint by short run periods on the engine. Start run 5 min, allow 
to cool, start run 10 min, allow to cool, etc.

This is per a Berg tech article.

Another solution might be high temp powder coating. I know the local shop 
does this.

I'd love to hear about a real solution that lasts.
