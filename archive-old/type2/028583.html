Okay
Anybody who has been following the story up to this point might have a clue where I am at with my engine replacement.  Anyway...put a new engine in, etc....now it seems that there are a few electrical problems.  Probably my fault....when i bought the van, it had a blown engine.  In order to move it around in my yard, I drove around by the starter.  Naturally not a bright thing to do...but hey..Im lazy.  Anyway....engine replaced, now won't start.  I am good with mechanical but absolutely horrible with electrical so perhaps someone could point me in the right direction.  
   The starter seems very very very weak...not enough power to do much more than slowly turn engine.  The PO had used the hot post to connect a variety of wiring to a hot lead.  I disconnected all this stuff temporarily and it seemed a little better.  After a moment or so of cranking (hoping it might just fire up)the starter was hot enough to fry bacon (or sausage) on.  What next.  Should I replace the starter?  Replace the cable?  I don''t have a multimeter (and have no more than a vague idea how to use one) but would be willing to buy one if I know what to look for.  Is it typical to have that many wires (4 total--don't yet know what for) hooked to the starter?  So far, all i have done for this particular problem is to clean ground strap on trans.   Any help greatly appreciated!!!
Thanks
Mike Edwards
