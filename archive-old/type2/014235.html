Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Runaround



&gt; Mobile auto glass installer in the last coupla months has replaced
&gt; windshields for both the businesses on each side of my shop. I asked about
&gt; the price for a German windshield for my T-II. He says &quot;Sigla??&quot; and I say
&gt; &quot;YES!!&quot; and he says he will get back to me. The coupla weeks later he came
&gt; by when I was gone from the shop and drops off a card. It says, $189
&gt; w/seal. I called their number, got a machine, left a message, two days
&gt; later they call and I placed the order, then proceeded to remove the
&gt; Mexican junk glass and prepare the opening for the new German glass they
&gt; have said will be installed the following week.
&gt; 
&gt; On the day they are to install the glass, their office calls and says the
&gt; seal will cost an extra $50. Note this is after the van has left and is on
&gt; the ferry over to the island. When the van pulls up, he pulls out a PPG
&gt; windshield. I inform him that's not what I ordered. I also informed him my
&gt; cost for a seal is $26 and he can keep his $50 item and take that $50 off
&gt; my $189 cost. He hemms and haws as it is apparent he is not going to get
&gt; away with this kind of bait and switch like he usually does, then calls the
&gt; office. 

I'm surprised that he did this to someone in the trade.  They usually reserve this sort of BS for private parties.  It's almost SOP for any sort 
of automotive service to have them get into the job far enough that the vehicle isn't drivable and then find &quot;additional problems&quot; to be fixed. 
 There are honest folks out there, but the bill-padders seem to be in the majority.  Then folks wonder why I am loathe to take my cars to 
mechanics.  Unfortunately, the bad apples have tainted the business for all.

&gt; Eventually, he states they can get the German glass. I ask about the price.
&gt; If you recall, that's what I first asked about more than a month earlier
&gt; before I placed the order and authorized the work based upon what they
&gt; said. He hemms and haws and makes another phone call then says same price,
&gt; $189 w/seal. What I realize and he evidently doesn't is he just pi**ed off
&gt; $31 worth of my time with no value received, driving up my cost.

He didn't care.  He was gambling with your money.

&gt; It took over a month to confirm price and availability. It remains to be
&gt; seen what they actually provide, with all the wishy-washy hemming and
&gt; hawing goin' on.

My gut feeling is that he'll find out what the wholesale price is for the Sigla and then &quot;suddenly find out&quot; that it isn't available.  He'll have 
the PPG glass and his hope is that you will go for that deal.  If you don't, he isn't out any money and he's under no legal obligation to 
provide you with the parts he promised.

&gt; I scares me that such business practices don't lead to bankrupsy in a few
&gt; months.

They survive because their business isn't one that gets a lot of return traffic.  Their customers need their vehicle and are anxious to get it 
back on the road.  Such people are ripe for plucking.

Seems that there are quite a few auto glass outfits out there.  Have you considered trying a different one?  Better to pay more than deal 
with a liar.

&gt; If they show up with more bulls**t and hemming and hawing, it won't
&gt; just be poor word of mouth they get from me. I will post a public notice
&gt; via letter to the editor of the local paper and I will name names, in
&gt; writing.

Which the paper probably won't print.  Wouldn't do to offend a potential advertiser, and they open themselves up to libel suits.

&gt; It will also inform the public that if you must have cheap for
&gt; Euro auto services, you must go elsewhere, as you can only get quality
&gt; parts and service from my shop.

Good policy.  I wish you the best in your auto glass odyssey.

George Lyle
