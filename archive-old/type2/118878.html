Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Extractor - Eliminators

&gt; Does anyone know of a GOOD set of eliminators that I can install on my Bus's engine that I can use to
eliminate the heat extractors? It seems to me almost pointless to have them on my Bus. I am missing everything
that has to do with heating, except the extractors (that's the way I got it), so I'd rather just replace them
with good exhaust pieces.
----------------------------------------------------------

72 to 74 heater boxes have one-piece exhaust pipes in them. All you need to do is strip off the heater box
material and cover the two holes in the upper cylinder tin.
But if they are good heater boxes, you may want to trade them for a pair of rusted out ones.
The only down side will be where to bolt the lower end of your alternator support and the heater box end of
the lower tin.......
