    Probably a good reason to go to a bigger, external oil cooler as
well. With it's own electric fan. And, if you did it right (meaning
using hydraulic hose with real fittings rather than the hose clamp model
so it wouldn't leak) and placed it right or ducted it right, it could be
a wonderful heat source. 
    The more I look at that flap setup, the less I like it. Not the
warming up part, but it sure looks like it would have one side running
hotter or colder than the other most of the time. Has anyone ran cyl
temp gauges on all 4 cylinders -- seems like a recall something being
sold like that years back, with a 4-way switch to the gauge. And you'd
certainly get better oil cooling with the stock cooler by removing that
flap -- which would add to the oil life. Might be worth running a test
of oil and cyl. temp with flap in and removed.
