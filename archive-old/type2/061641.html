Subject: Re: PVC for filler hose

&gt;Thanks for all your assistance in the hose situation.  Just to share, I
&gt;purchased straight 57mm fuel hose (Gates).  It does bend, but not enough to
&gt;work in this bus, so off I went to Builders Square (like Home Depot or Lowes).
&gt;There I purchased a PVC bend with an outside diameter of practically 57 mm.
&gt;Slipped in nicely to the hose.  I made the measurements, cut the hose, clamped
&gt;in the bend and, voila', a fuel filler hose for a '73 bus.  The PVC pipe is
&gt;the heavy duty stuff, not the standard you use with minor plumbing jobs.  It
&gt;is very sturdy with a highly gloss finish.  There was another acronym
&gt;following the PVC in the description but unfortunately I don't remember it
&gt;right now.  
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows any problems that I may face with this installation, please
&gt;reply.

Hmm.  One part of my US Plastics catalog says that PVC and CPVC are
&quot;Unresistant, not recommended for service applications under any conditions&quot;
with gasoline.  In another part of the same catalog, flexible PVC tubing is
listed as &quot;good&quot; for gasoline.  I suspect that components of gasoline will
be absorbed by PVC and the stuff will soften over a period of time.  I don't
know how long that will take.

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
