as they say, different folks etc.  wonder what VW would have put on em if
todays selection were avaliable in 1977???

I have been running nothing but 205's on this van for about 7 years now
and am very pleased, had 195's on previous vans.  (Michelin MXL &amp; MXT).
consider I use my van for work and it is heavily loaded (at least as much
as a Westy) and that I am a ski instructor and have to drive on snow
covered roads in the winter, as well as make decent speed on the
interstate.  Wind has always been my biggest concern and the 205's have
really helped there too.  actually I would have gone to something wider
but couldn't get anything else in the stock wheelwells.
