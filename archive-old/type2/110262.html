Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

&lt;&lt; Sure, the big guys get big tax breaks, but.. they also pay the most taxes,

and if we keep bashing them, sooner or later they're not going to foot the

bill anymore. And unless we all become proficient welders, metalurgists, and

metal fabricators.. we're going to be S**T out of luck for parts. Just

remember... the parts people, Volkswagen of America, etc.. are not owned by

hippies. They're owned by business oriented investors.

Guess there's not enough of a profit margin to interest Bechtel in rebuilding
VW's... ;-)
