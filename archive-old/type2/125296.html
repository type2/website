Subject: jippin the job

&gt;there is nothing wrong with replacing the mechanical pump with an electric
&gt;one. And its not &quot;jippin the job&quot; as you say.
&gt;

I agree that there is nothing wrong with replacing the mechanical pump with
an electric pump. However, that is only if the electrical pump is installed
properly with proper failsafe wiring systems. I have seen too many dangerous
repairs made by fools too lazy or too stupid to do the job correctly. It
would be okay with me if someone makes a dangerous repair, if that repair
only endangered their own life, but dangerous repairs to vehicles endanger
all the innocent other drivers and pedestrians.

From the text of their inquiries it seems that they are newbies to VW busses
and to mechanics. If you don't know what you are doing, it is better to
stick with stock. So I would NOT reccommend that it is okay for them to
switch to an electrical fuel pump.
