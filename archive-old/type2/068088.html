Subject: '68 Wiring Diagram

I have a very early '68 bus, and am looking for the wiring diagram for
it.

Don't say Bentley!!  the diagram in Bentley is wrong for my bus - mine
doesn't have either parking lights or reverse lights - but does have 2
bulbs at the rear - one for indicators, 1 for stop/tail...

I am having on-going problems with the lights, and really _NEED_ a
wiring diagram...

Anyone?

Thanks,

Jonathan.
