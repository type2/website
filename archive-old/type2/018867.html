The ONLY way to beat the rust and preserve your bus (hey! that rhymes!) is to
move to Arizona!  ;o)  Seriously though... Neil Young said it best.  &quot;Rust
never sleeps.&quot;  The only way I know of is to do as many of us in cold country
do.  Buy a $500 winter beater (I use an AMC Eagle. An American Quattro!) and
hide the bus.

&gt; I want to block out these nasties and preserve my

&gt; insideous rusting. Stuck in indecisiveness with winter
&gt; coming.
&gt; Your latest summary thoughts are appreciated.
