Subject: Campmobile

Can anyone tell me if my '73 campmobile was a Westi?  All the camper
interior was removed by PO. VIN 233-.  Hole in floor behind passenger
seat.  Hole in roof with plastic scoop.  Electrical recepticle for 110
hookup on drivers side.  Light colored wood paneling.  And last
lourved(sp?) windows in sliding door and opposite side. 

Thank you,
