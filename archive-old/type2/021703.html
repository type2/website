Subject: Bus  for Sale, Vancouver BC

Hey there folks.  The time has come to sell the Transporter.  List members get
first dibs.
I'd really like to sell it to someone who knows what they're getting into, not
some kid who'll drive it to the ground without the regular maintenance we know
they need.

The link below will get you to the page and it's the Orange and White one.  Not
the Westy.

New brakes, Park brake works great., ALL new exhaust system (used exchangers),
BN6 heater works well.  Stock heater works well also, new heater cables.  A good
winter bus.

Paint is in great shape, new lower sliding door runner welded in. Assorted parts
with it
(inst. cluster, steering wheel, etc. we can talk)  All windows work.  All rubber
good.  Seals good

Speedo inop. Dash lites inop (heater lights work so there's power there). Horn
inop.  Leaky push rod tubes (have seals).  Carb could use some work. Floor needs
some small patches as the pics will show.

Other than that, the bus is in what I think to be great shape.  Power train very
strong (1800)

There is also an original roof rack. Can someone let me know what this thing
might be worth.  The PO re-varnished the wood and re-painted the metal black.
One hold-down clamp bolt is missing.  It's strong otherwise.

I'd be happy with $4500.00 CDN  for the bus w/o the rack.
