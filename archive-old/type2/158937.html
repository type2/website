Subject: Re: [T2] 12 socket that goes in Deluxe stove knob panel and
  wiring

Question re Re source of socket that just fits in knob panel hole of stove:
Don't know the brand I used, but a typical Pep Boys/Parts America likely 
sells what I used-
One extra I have here is labeled Motormite HELP Cigarette Lighter wiring 
kit.  It has an inner core 22mm in diameter that slips into the hole and 
an outer collar that screws to rear threads you should be able to see 
through the blister pak. It comes with a metal bracket holder with just 
the right hole you could cut down into a washer if necessary. The center 
wire is always positive and the outer is ground.  I've used these on a 
drilled dash hole, which self grounds when the collar is tightened.
Raidioshack  sells one (27-1556) that is wider (27.1mm diameter) and 
might fit if you enlarge the hole?  Comes with a fuse also. It pushes in 
and snaps in place with spader lugs for the wires. I used one in the 
rear face of the sink cabinet, pushing it into a drilled hole and adding 
some glue. One can never have too many outlets, between fans, laptop 
power supply, portable TV,  cell ph charger-and 12v fridge/cooler- these 
need not have a high amperage- a flatscreen is about 1 amp- the wire 
that comes with these outlets is 16g for 3 amps, about what my Coleman 
cooler uses- I put a 5 amp fuse in the line; a 10 amp would blow in 
time. For the runs to my dash I used 12 gauge wire and 10 amp fuses.
If you plan to use inverters, pay attention to their wattage- ie, a 300 
watt one = 25 amps at 12 volts and you should use direct wiring from the 
battery- I ran 8 gauge from the spare battery to the inverter that 
resides in that gap between the side of the bedseat and the body wall.
