Subject: 1st Engine drop-Success!

Finally got the engine out of my 1978 Bus today. Kept putting it off because
I had no one to help. I don't need no stinking help... In spite of its size
it was easier than a Beetle. I'm going to replace the main tranny seal, main
oil seal and oil cooler seals.
Because the #1/#2 side is tapping and fouling plugs, I plan to take the head
off and have a look/see while I have it out.
I've asked some of these questions before and got no response so I have to
assume I've stumped the experts or the questions are so frequently asked you
can't bear  to answer one more time. If it's the latter I apologize, but
would be forever grateful for some help- as my engine is currently sitting
in the driveway.

Q: My tranny shaft has a little wobble to it. Is this normal?
Q: If I take my head off to inspect, do I have to use new gaskets (can't
find them for sale separately)or can I use a little silicone?
Q:I have a lot of oil in my fan and heating system. Could this be from my
leaky main seal or something more insidious?
Any help is appreciated.
