I'm not ever going to get deeply invested in this to the point of flaming
(the VanBondo family is perfectly free to forbear to sell its busses to
buyers of any continent, and believe me, nobody from overseas would ever
want mine), but a few points:

Every year many busses go to the crusher, and none are made to replace
them. If they are to survive, it will only be because they are preserved.
They will only be preserved (fact of life) if they are valuable. A few will
be preserved because they have sentimental value--but only a few. If many
are to be preserved, it will only because it is financially feasible. In
order for it to be financially feasible, the resale value has to be high.

Hint: who sheds a tear over the demise of the Nash Rambler? Maybe three old
guys in Wisconsin. Ramblers are barely worth two cents a pound. Who gives a
shit about a Ford Falcon? Who gives a shit about an AMC Matador? All these
cars are unique, but unique is not enough. Vintage is not enough. Vintage
don't keep them alive; value keeps them alive.

For another instance, there is a car called (I think) a Williams. It was
only produced for a few months in the early 50s, and is very, very rare. It
has the distinction of being the first glass-bodied car in production--yes,
before the Corvette. Not a knock-off, not a one-off, an actual production
car of which only a handful survive with an absolutely unique lineage.

But it ain't worth squat. It's not a collector car. Never caught on. Nobody
cares about it. The Japanese ain't after Williamses. They're a truly
extinct breed.

At present, I wouldn't call the VW, *any* VW, a collector car. The reason
is, only VW fanatics collect them, even the rarest ones. VWs don't mix it
up with the Dusenbergs and the Stutzes and the Auburns. VWs aren't
auctioned at Harrah's. That may be good or it may be bad, I don't really
have an opinion. But I do know that nobody sends an Auburn to the shredder
because its carcass is an eyesore, rusting away in the pasture. They will
restore those cars if they have to fabricate every part from the frame up,
because it is worth it to do that.

The Japanese bid VWs up because VWs are valuable to them (at least the
flashier ones). When they do it, they make your bus more valuable--without
you working on it, without you making any investment in it, without you
doing anything at all. Yes, this has the effect of making busses more
expensive *for you*, as well as for them--but it also preserves the
vehicles and gives your bus a higher resale value, which makes the next
owner more likely to preserve it in turn.

What I'm telling you is, this is how you preserve a breed; you make it
desirable. If the breed is desirable while simultaneously being in short
supply, then it is expensive and becomes inaccessible. It may be hard to
swallow, but this is a *good* thing--because the alternative is grim. The
alternative is extinction. The mini-mills in Cleveland would be very happy
to melt your bus down, two cents a pound, no wheels needed, dead cars
removed free.

Joe Fournier came up with two, count 'em, two 59 portholes. Both need
rooves welded in and extensive restoration. And nobody is going to answer
him. Because they aren't that valuable, they aren't worth the welding and
trailering. Find me somebody who says, &quot;I don't want to bother with the
J-model Dusenberg because it just isn't worth the effort.&quot; Then you can
kvetch about foreigners running the prices up.
