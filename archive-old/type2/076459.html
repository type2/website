Subject: re: New Type 2s with radiators....

Chuck &amp; list,

   While visiting Brazil last year I was fortunate to meet a DJ who
owned a type 2 manufactured about 1990, and he let me drive it. I wasn't
familiar with the engine it was using, definitely FI and possibly that
golf engine. About a quarter of the buses in brazil have an alcohol
burning engine because of the emissions issues, but they have been
phased out because of engine wear issues and the current cost of alcohol
vs. gasoline. And the body styling was a little strange-- mostly your
average 70's breadloaf but the rear hatch/window were designed along the
lines of the splitty's rear end, with a smaller window. Some buses had
ane extra 4 inch hardtop roof, other didn't (aftermarket?). I don't know
about the radiator; perhaps it was a swamp cooler? But back to my
friend's comby--- it was so fun to drive! Much more kick than my 1600
engine. In true Rio driving fashion, I nearly flattened a pedestrian and
wound through twisty hilly cobblestone streets at an unsafe speed. The
low points: no heater controls (and probably not missed in brazil), no
radio, very minimal creature comforts (even compared to regular VW
spartan accomodations). These are definitely workhorses. I've got
pictures of type 2 mail trucks, public transit (quasi-legal),
ambulances, and my personal favorite, the Rio de Janeiro police bus,
complete with lights on top (the cops even posed because my girlfriend
told them I was some kind of magazine photographer). R.I.P. the
Brazilian type 2 manufacturing.

&gt; While messing around in Mexico two weeks ago, I noticed literally
hundreds
&gt; of new type 2s with several interesting variations.

&gt; I don't know if these are Mexican local buses or imports from Brazil,
but
&gt; one in 4 had a radiator....gasp. Gasoline engines. With a spot in the
front
&gt; with a black plastic grill for a radiator. Stock. I actually wanted
one.

&gt; Anybody seen a closeup of these wasserboxers that look like 79 vintage
type
&gt; 2s? With their black grills?

&gt; I also saw hundreds and hundreds of BRAND SPANKING NEW old style Type
1s. I
&gt; asked the year model on one and the answer was &quot;dos mil dos&quot;. 2002.

&gt; Gorgeous. They are still making those in Puebla, where they make the
new
&gt; Beetles.
