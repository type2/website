Subject: Re:Rear Shift Coupler Screw

Ricardo and list,
   You asked...&quot;The problem is I can't remove my old one because the
screw has a square head....Is there any kind of special tool to do this?&quot;

   The answer is no, but yes.  For working with square headed fasteners you 
have 2 choices, an open end wrench or an 8 point socket.
I know those shift coupler screws can be very tight after years of not being 
touched, so the wrench might not work.  That leaves the 8 point socket.  Is 
that considered a special tool?  I don't know.  Most good tool suppliers 
should have them though.
