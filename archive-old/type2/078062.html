Subject: Re: [T2] Do you need separate oil temp and pressure sender?

&gt; I have a 71 Westy with Oil Pressure guage. There's a sender connected right

&gt; both?

William,

Oil pressure and oil temperature are different senders and are mounted in
different places on the engine.  Oil pressure (as you know) is measured at
the top rear of the case, Oil temperature is measured in the sump.  All my
experience for eh last decade is with the T4 motors in the later buses, so
I defer to others on best location, tho I would suggest the sump plate as
a good one.

&gt; What is the best way to connect, keeping the stock oil pressure
&gt; switch?

VDO makes, and most vendors sell, a dual oil pressure switch that has both
the gauge and idiot light feeds. It replaces the stock switch and should
be a no sweat installation on a T1 engine.  Maybe some distributor
clearance problems... anyone?
