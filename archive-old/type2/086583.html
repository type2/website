I am looking for the little tin pieces on a 1600 motor that attach to =
the left and right of the crank pulley under the other sheet metal. They =
go under the other flat tin, and protect/cool 2 and 4 cylinders.  The =
pieces are about 3 inches wide and 8 inches long.  If anyone has one or =
both or these they can part with, let me know.  I need them desperately =
to get a bus back on the road for a local guy. =20
