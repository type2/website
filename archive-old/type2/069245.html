Subject: RE: 6 cyl Porsche in 1980 Westy?

Fresh meat!  Aircooled Vgon owners who haven't heard my ranting about the
joys of 6cyl Vgons!  Wonderful car.  Mine is an 81, with 1978 3.0liter
(nominally 180hp) engine.  Only the EVEN more expensive 3.2liter engines
are low enough to fit under the engine deck, so depending on engine you
may need to build a hat on your engine lid; I did.  Look in the vanagon
archives for a summary I did of my conversion.  Only downsides are:
cost of the engine (I have one for sale for $2500 or so); somewhat re-
duced ground clearance; might need to alter or remove rear cabinet in
Westy.  No other significant problems.

Email me direct if you have more specific questions.  The general answer
is that it is a wonderful idea, and the level of difficulty is roughly
same as airconditioning an unairconditioned car.  Motivated amateur can
do (has done!) this upgrade.
