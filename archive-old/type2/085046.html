Subject: Re: [T2] Contacting Miller FI

Check this:

Also Scott's site rocks, so check it out:

If you are resourceful, like Scott, the stuff you would need to buy from
Miller is minimal to none.  Get a good CIS FI book and learn it to see if
you can live with it.  Then start thinking about how to adapt it to your
motor.  Heck if I had a bay the CIS would be a great way to go!

Miller seems to focus the kit on the T1 guys, but the T4 is much easier to
convert to CIS.  If you are serious about this issue e-mail me off-line and
we can compare notes on this conversion...  Hopefully Scott will let us pick
his brain a little bit as well :)

The one change I would like to try is instead of using 4 intake runners like
Scott does is to try and use 2 with Weber 34ICT aluminum intakes.  The main
issue will be if the injectors will mount properly.  Where Scott mounted the
throttle body and fuel distributor is perfect from what I can see.  Oh and
the thermocouplers were a stroke of genius!  But that might only work for us
T4 upright conversion perversion guys.

The parts are dirt cheap in the junkyards because so many European cars used
this system...  I am strongly convinced that this system could be cheaper
than big dual carbs if you are resourceful.
