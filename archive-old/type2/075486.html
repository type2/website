Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

Dave,

Thanks!  The pictures are part of the reason it took me soo long to do the
removal job&lt;grin&gt;.

I will have a big update on the process for the list soon...there is  lot
more to &quot;boiling out&quot; a tank than meets the eye and it appears from other
e-mails that quite a few people are contemplating this job soon.


I already checked this morning on how to get articles in the library and
will do my best to shoot some more pics to go with the others...am hoping
to get a shot of the inside of the tank, do some more write up and then
submit for the library.

This tank had been sitting for 8 years...pretty hot summers/cold winters.
I believe that it was pretty full when it was parked also.  I have worked
on a 68 double cab also and after 12 years of sitting, the tank just had
black goo...the stuff in the 78 was *rock* hard *everywhere*.

Maybe it depends on the type/brand of gas also???

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave, many thanks for posting the URL for your photos [
&gt; http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/].  They have to be the clearest 
&gt; photos of how a tank is installed in a bus that I have ever seen.  The shots 
&gt; of the vent lines and the rubber connections, the second elbow between tank 
&gt; and fill tube, the entire interior of the fuel tank compartment...WOW!
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to ask if there was a way to get them into the archives as a 
&gt; data source to reference when folks on the list talk about &quot;gas smell while 
&gt; turning,&quot; a &quot;leak of gas from the left side,&quot; &quot;how do I remove my gas tank,&quot; 
&gt; etc.  With the addition of a photo of the first rubber fitting behind the 
&gt; bulkhead cover on the right side (big round black metal plate) it would make 
&gt; a complete picture set.  Bentley, Haynes and others have nothing equal for 
&gt; visually describing all the little bits and parts of rubber that should be 
&gt; replaced every now and then, as well as being sources of leaks and fumes 
&gt; (smells).
&gt; 
&gt; I have to remove and clean the tank in my '71, and although it is different 
&gt; from a '78, I am better prepared now than before.  Having a '72 and '78 as 
&gt; well, your pics are invaluable.  I would really hope that they make it into 
&gt; the archives, but better yet, into the technical section.
&gt; 
&gt; Two questions for the list:  1.  How long does it take for gasoline to turn 
&gt; solid, if the bus is just sitting?   weeks, months, years?    2.  It appears 
&gt; that there is room to add some Reflectix in the gas tank compartment.  Would 
&gt; this contribute to sound deadening/gas tank cooling?
&gt; 
&gt; Dave, many thanks once again for a super set of photos!
