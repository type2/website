&gt; &gt;Amen brother..... Just did that last weekend..  The correct tool will take
&gt; &gt;minutes of time of the installation and cut down the frustration factor. But
&gt; &gt;if not definitely have a few small screwdrivers to help pry..
&gt;
&gt; Just curious, for next time: does the &quot;right&quot; tool do a better job of grabbing those circlip eyes?  I can see how beefier pliers would give better leverage and have the
&gt; right span, but what makes 'em hold onto the clips better?

The tips that engage the holes in the circlip have a slight &quot;hourglass&quot;
shape, slightly large in diameter at the end than 1/8 inch from the end.
If the clip starts to slip on these, then then do slip onto the tip not
off.
