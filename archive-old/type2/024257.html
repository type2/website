I recently contacted Euro-American RV Products (formerly Delta Six Industries, Inc) about push button cabinet handles. The guy there told me they were getting the equipment togather to start making them again, sometime in the next few months.  I lost the e-mail address, but their p-mail is 2506 Douglas Dam RD, Sevierville, Tenn 37876.  Phone 423-908-9384. Perhaps a few more handle inquires would speed up the process.
