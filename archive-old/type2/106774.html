&gt;
&gt; Listees,
&gt;     I have another situation. My sliding door does not pop open when I pull
&gt; the handle. I have to knee it in the middle of the door and it pops open
&gt; then.
&gt;     My question is do I have to make some sort of adjustment or just grease
&gt; some parts?

I've had good success on several Busses with lubrication only. The first thing to do is to
clean out the lower channel (below the floor) and lay down some clean grease. Do the same
with the upper channel at the belt line. The next thing to do is to thoroughly lube the
rear latch. I start with WD40 to loosen up the 30 year old factory lube. Then spray
something a little thicker in there, like bicycle chain lube, to keep it permanently
loose.  The last thing is that the upper channel has a plastic guide piece which sets on
the channel and it has probably gotten really sloppy over the years and contributes to the
door sticking. I believe that part is available but I haven't tried to source it for myself
as the lubrication has always worked for me.
