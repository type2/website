Subject: Crazy 12v alternator in a 6v bus...

Hey folks.  Got a strange one.


6 volt bus, all original.  I installed ichigo's engine, which is twelve
volt, of course.  Converted all the needed engine electricals to 6v, no
problem.

Left the alternator, and wired it to two 6 volt batteries, in series.
This lets the bus run on 6v, but gives me access to 12v when I need it.
Standard fare. Alternator in question is a new (a few months) AL82X. 100%
perfect operation in a normal 12v bus.

Alt B+ connects to the positive terminal of the first battery, neg
terminal of the first battery connects to the positive terminal of the
second battery.  Second negative goes to ground.  Bus runs off of the
second positive.  simple.

Alt D+ connects to the wire that runs from the gen. light.

Gen light functions (normally) like so.  Switched 6v feeds into the bulb,
then a wire runs from the bulb, to the regulator.  The regulator grounds
the wire when it is not producing electricity, lifts the ground when it
is.


Now, what's the trouble, you ask?

Everything intalled and functioning properly (yes, we everything is
charging correctly).  Key on, gen light comes on, just like before (half
as bright as the oil light, but it's been that way since I got the bus. I
suspected a corroded bulb base..).

Crank the bus, and the oil light goes out. Gen light gets brighter though!
And stays that way.  &quot;normal&quot; brightness (ie, like the oil light).

Wierd.

Again, everything is functioning (except the light..) perfectly.
Everything is charging as it should.


So.

I check the bulb, turns out to be a 12v bulb.  That explains why it was
dim.

Check all the connections, and they are fine.  Pull the plug from the alt,
and sure enough, the light goes out.

Now.

With the D+ wire DISCONNECTED when the engine is started, and during this
test, the D+ remains with no voltage.

Engine still running, apply the wire from the light, blip the throttle,
and remove the wire.  There is now a steady 13.98 volts at D+

If you start the engine with the wire attached, it immediatly starts
producing ~14 volts at D+.  Test .while. wire attached still shows 13.98,
as well as with the wire off.


Something else I noticed that is making no sense...There is never
continuity from D+ to ground. Under any circumstance.  At least, it wont
set off the beep on my multimeter's continuity checker.  I have not
checked for exact resistance, though.


---


theorys.....

The light goes to normal brightness due to the 14 volts coming from D+,
which is then looping back through the 6v system, and find some sort of
ground.  No other systems are affected by this.  Nothing runs fast,
nothing shines brighter.

Also, I suspect that somehow the 6v from the light is .triggering. the 14v
from D+, somehow feeding it enough to get it started.  A jump start.



Now, do I have a question? Sure. WHY THE HELL IS THIS happening?!?:(

I have not yet checked this D+ behavior against a normal running AL82X
that a friend has.  I will tomorrow.

I'm open to suggestions, ideas, etc etc. Even flames. As long as they
arent in my bus.;p

thanks...

...david  (oh, if someone has a full breakout of what is going on in the
82X, I'd love to see it...)
