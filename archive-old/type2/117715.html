Subject: Re: [T2] 2L Dual Solex Fuel pump specs req'd

Greg,

Just look at the specs for adjusting the psi on the original
stock pump...seems 3 psi was about right.

Then go to the flaps and tell them you need an electric fuel pump for
a carbed engine that delivers about 3psi....not too much more.

Dual carbs(in your engine) are not going to make much difference over 
single carbs in terms of fuel delivery.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But... Sometime since I removed this pump in May it has been damaged, and the 
&gt; supply inlet nipple has broken off clean.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone please help me out with the fuel flow specs required to feed these 
&gt; carbs? A NAPA or Canadian Tire part number would be most excellent, if one is 
&gt; available.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
