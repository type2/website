Subject: Re: [T2] '71 &quot;Clunk&quot; in steering

probably steering gear box... they will go at random, so I hear.  mine's 
in similar shape as yours, or so it sounds.  my 69 has over 300,000 
miles on it that I know of. 

I would be interested if some more folks might chime in on their 
experiences remedying this problem.  I've heard all of the following 
from mechanics that I trust:

1. it can be rebuilt, but you have to find a rebuilt kit, and you can't 
get them any more.
2. I can rebuild you a worm gear.
3. I took mine apart filled it with grease and it has worked fine ever 
since.
4. Don't rebuild it yourself! This is a difficult procedure and only a 
reputable machinist can reproduce one for you.
5.  (A talented machinist) &quot;I' d fashion you a worm gear,  but I can't 
guarantee it would work&quot;
6. (from the shop in, I think Redmond, CA) We've been rebuilding them 
for years.  $399 plus a $150 core.
7.  someone on T2 list:  go to...Redmond or Redding ( I apologize for 
forgetting the shop in Redmond, or...CA?)
8. I'd never buy a rebuilt one.  I can get you a new one, but they're 
$600.  If I were you I'd look in a junk yard. (!)  

I still haven't decided what I'll do... haven't found a good used one 
from a clunker as of late.
Best, Karen
