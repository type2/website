&gt; &gt;1. How much is the Robert Bentley Official Volkswagen Service Manual?

&gt; $27.96 plus shipping for Model Years 60-78

&gt; &gt;2. Where can I order one from.  I am in a little town in AZ.

&gt; amazon_dot_com (and probably Borders or Barnes and Noble)


Or busdepot_dot_com, where you pay the same price minus a 5% listmember
discount. (Must request the discount when ordering.)
