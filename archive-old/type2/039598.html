Subject: Re: sway away kits/offroad

All,

I've run my '69 with 7/8&quot; Sway-Aways for a little over
2 years and I've never had any off-road problems,
either.

On my last camping trip, we (wife, son, me and a bus
*full* of crap;-) went up a fairly steep, rutty, muddy
road to get to our final destination with *zero*
problems. I had to think my way through a few spots
where the mud was too deep, or where large rocks lay,
but that was it. We even passed a campsite with a
Toyota 4x4 and the owners smirked at us as we
passed...I guess they thought we'd get stuck, but we
showed 'em!

The biggest drawback to off road that I have, are the
street tires (Pirelli's) and the lack of power my
tired 1600 develops.

Also, I find that even the most avid camper spends
considerably more time driving on paved roads than off
road, so the benefits from the sway bars outweigh the
detractors, IMHO.


HEY! Maybe someone should sponsor a hill-climb at the
next bus-together:-) My money's on a splitty with
reduction gears...I took my '57 places you'd never
dream of taking a loaf!!!

&gt;     I've logged tons of offroad miles over all kinds

&gt; Westy.  The '77 really is 
&gt; stiff as a board, but I haven't had any offroad
&gt; problems as yet.  Ground 
&gt; clearance loss is negligible, plus when rocks hit
&gt; them, they make an 
&gt; interesting thung! sound. (There is also an added
&gt; bonus---when I put on my 
&gt; offroad tires, I only have to jack up the bus once
&gt; per side.  It's so rigid, 
&gt; both wheels come off the ground!).  After two years
&gt; with it, my impression of 
&gt; the kit is that it's great for better cornering, but
&gt; has little effect in 
&gt; windy conditions.  Highly recommended for Westy
&gt; owners, IMO.
