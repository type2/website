Subject: Re: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

Hi Gang:

Once again I must remind folks that comparing Amazon_dot_com to a small
10-person business like Bus Depot dealing in
antigue/collectible/vintage auto parts is a clear case of comparing
apples and oranges.

I set up websites and administer networks for a living and there is
so much work involved in changing a site like Ron's over to a new
Php-driven system like Amazon_dot_com, or some of the others.  It is not 
surprising that small businesses can't quickly make these changes.

I'm not a mechanic and if I have any question about unique parts for
my unique vehicle, I will call!   Businesses like the Depot get it to
me and get it right.   The recommend others if they don't have it.

Unlike AMAZON.COM, or FLAPS sites like Kragen_dot_com, folks like Bus
Depot and Bus Boys LIVE for Buses, are passionate about them and
provide much needed parts without which our vehicles like my 78 would
not run!

Let's stop the bashing and get back to talking about our buses!

Thanks for listening,

BEN
