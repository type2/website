Subject: First Engine Removal : Bad Mistake day 3

Hey all, 
        Well, day three here, and boy have I made a bad mistake! 
I removed the old pistons, they looked kind of bad, and took forever
to remove!  I took the heads out of the carb cleaner and scrubbed them
and scrubbed them and scrubbed them.  I cleaned the case a little
more, cleaned out the push rod tube holes for a good seal.  I unwrapped
my brand new pistons and cylinders and scrubbed the heck out of the
cylinders with bon ami (ala Bob).  I couldn't get the flywheel off
(couldn't hold the flywheel still).  So I put the pressure plate and
the clutch back on, I figure I'll replace the front and rear seals 
next time I pull the engine, which will happen soon since...

After cleaning everything, it was time for reassembley.  The plan was
to lap the valves and the cylinders to the cylinder head, and put the
engine back together and install it in the bus.  Anyway, I go to lap
the valves and check the fit of the cylinder to head, and what do you
know.  Seems somewhere down the line, someone opened up the heads (or
swapped them) and the Ps&amp;Cs I took off were 1800!!!!!!  So I have a
brand new set of 1700cc pistons and cylinders, all oiled up, bores
scrubbed diligently ala Bob, and they don't fit the heads/engine I
own / just disassembled!

        A while back I picked up a dismantled engine, including a set
of heads.  I checked, these heads are the 1700 size.  So I dumped the
this set into the carb cleaner.  In a few days, Ill scrub those clean
replace the missing studs in them, and lap the valves and install them
with the new heads I just bought, thus installing a slightly smaller
engine than the one I removed.  

So, I think I'll take the 1800 size heads and take my time and replace
the valve guides and valves, and whatever else, and get some 1800 size
jugs, and build a second engine.  (basically what I planned to do
before, when I though both engines I owned were 1700!!!:)  

AAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHH.  I was supposed to have my bus running today,
and begin working on the second engine next weekend!  Now I'll work
evenings to get the bus running!!  Measure twice, cut once.  Well in
this case I measured zero times and assumed and got bitten HARD.  Oh
well, we all learn some way or another!

While you are all here... Anyone wanna a answer a question for a silly
guy?  

1) how do you keep the flywheel from turning when you want to remove
it and the pressure plate?

2) how do you remove the rear three holed thing that the fan
attaches to, (and covers the rear seal)?

3)  Will the push rod tubes still fit?  I am assuming so, I'll check
tomorrow.

Hope everyone was more productive than me this holiday.

take care,
        brandy
