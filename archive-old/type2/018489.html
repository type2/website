So I got the bus back from the mechanic.
1 1/2 weeks later I'm driving and I can't go more than 30 mph and he's
louder than any beast I've ever heard.!!/??*#_at_*
So I call dave (the mech.) and I say what is UP?
I take it in and here he had to set the timing and shoot more oil in cuz
there was none. and new points. of course all for free. I'm hanging
w/the real mech. (dave owns the place and the people workin there )
who worked at a VW dealer for 15 yrs.  He says &quot;didn't  dave tell you
about the oil  leak?&quot;  what  what  	&quot;I paid 2,432.86  and the oil leak
isn't fixed?  I thought the engine was fine and strong!&quot;
The mech says then &quot; i guess he didn't want to pursue it and BTW you
should schedual to get your lifters replaced at the same time you get
the oil leak fixed it would be easier that way&quot;
what what what!!!! I think at that moment time froze and I got in my bus
and drove away other wise I would have lost it. 1,500 for labour the
rest parts. man I was feeling pretty ripped. untill I got a message on
my answer mach. that the second payment (the first was $1000 the second
was 1,432.86) bounced like a rubber ball!! whoo hoo! Karma of the VW
gottta love it. so I ran into a friend of mine that lives in his bus and
fixes other buses (he's really hard to find+ he thought I moved to
montana when I really just went on Vacation)  So on thur. we are gonna
sit down and I'm gonna learn about this motor I have, buy tools, replace
the pushrod tube seals+the valve cover gasket(the oil leaks) and
determine how much I owe him in reality not in Dave's perfect rip off
world. Can he sue me?
