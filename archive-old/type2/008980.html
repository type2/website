no ground to pins 5,
&gt;16, and 17 on the wiring harness, which is what I suspected but cound not
&gt;find previously.  Alas, now that I know what the problem is, you'd think I
&gt;could fix it just by pluging up the disconnected wire, but *I CAN'T FIND
&gt;IT!*  the Bentley manual shows white wires exiting the FI ECU and joining
&gt;a brown wire at a single connector, then heading for ground.
&gt;Where (physicaly) is this connector??????
&gt;
 Steve, 
are you sure 16 is a ground??? I believe it should be 15.
Follow the harness across the back by the distributor. You will find a group of small harness's coming out of the main harness. One with a blue connector, one with a brown connecter, and one with a black connecter. These go to cold start, thermotime, and aux. air. You will also find 3 white wires coming out. 15 and 17 are tied together with a female spade connecter and 5 is separate with it's own female spade connecter. Both of these go under the left side of the plenum and connect on to a ground connection under the forward-most case bolt [under your EGR valve, if you still have one].
(I still have a harness if you want it)
