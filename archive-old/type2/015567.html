The first thing I would do is put the proper Bosch coil on there. No one
else can be trusted to meet specs. Be sure you check fot hot spark at the
plug gap. Blue or white with an audible 'SNAP&quot; ist gut.  Make sure those
plugs are spec Bosch as well and in decent order. That goes for ALL the
ignition parts. Only Bosch and Beru are spec, and Beru is very poorly
available but Bosch can be had from many FLAPS.

&gt;Well I think that I have now read almost all the archives regarding ignition 
&gt;but alas I have not found the solution, so I come to you great gurus!
&gt;
&gt;I have a '79 Westy with a Cali engine but the FI system is non-cali (I don't 
&gt;have an ignition control unit). I believe the problem is with the ignition, 
&gt;the engine turns over and I can hear the fuel being supplied to the engine 
&gt;but it doesn't start.

Yes, and how many pounds of pressure does it sound like??????????
