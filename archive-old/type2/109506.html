Subject: Re: Fwd: [T2] Changing from Drums to Disc Brakes

Most people are not aware how good the stock brakes are WHEN THEY ARE IN THE
CORRECT CONDITION. I believe the 60-0 stopping distance on a bus is 122ft,
which is in the sports car category. People cheese out on replacing drums,
shoes, and hydraulic parts, then wonder why they have white-knuckle brakes.
