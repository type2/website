&gt;Steve, et al,
&gt;
&gt;I got around 880 mv on my digital voltmeter when I was driving around town
&gt;with my new O2 sensor.  The readings were fairly constant, maybe 50 mv
&gt;higher when going up a hill or accelerating, maybe 50 mv lower when
&gt;coasting.
&gt;
&gt;When I turned the AFM wheel a few notches clockwise (tightening the spring)
&gt;to lean the mixture, it drastically reduced my engine power and
&gt;acceleration, even though the O2 Sensor voltage was around 600 mv.  So I
&gt;turned it back where I started.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice?
&gt;
&gt;Thans again for your help steve.

Did you have any problems welding the socket on?

I'm just about done building my new engine.  Next week should do the trick.
I'm going to test it with the O2 sensor like you did.   If you look at the
power vrs economy curves and the Voltage curve for Lambda
(http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/mult_air_fuel_monitor/mult_air_fue
l
_monitor.htm)
 the difference between stoich and 800 mv is very fine.  I wonder if the
fine tune of this is really the bypass screw and idle CO setting?  You will
note that the maximum power range is far richer is than stoich.  Have you
seen any difference in economy at different settings?  I think my Altitude
circuit might be the answer to both power, economy and performance.  On for
power boost, off for economy.  What do you think?  A parallel circuit with
a resistor (variable) placed on the temp sensor #2 might do the same thing.
Changing what the ECU thinks the head temp is would change fuel mixture.
Interesting huh.  Wish I had an actual exhaust sniffer to verify this.

Have fun
