Wow, this is gonna be hard...da wife or da bus.  hmmmmm.  (racking brain
noises) I'm afraid it's a toss up!  They are both nice to sleep with.  They
both keep me warm when I'm camping.  They both make strange noises at me
sometimes.  Neither of them can cook.  They both smell nice--though I must
admit I do learn toward the smell of 90wt.  Hmmmmm.  But I have to give my
wife one thing, I've never had to put a clutch in her on some dark deserted
road.
     Peace, Love, and sorry I'm gonna keep them both...I wanna get laid
tonight
