&gt; ok.  problem.  the engine will start, rev for about one second, then
&gt; immediately stop.  no matter how many time i turn the key, same thing
&gt; every time.  if i put my put on the gas pedal and then start it, it
&gt; revs high, but the moment i take my foot off the gas pedal, it stops.
&gt; i have a 77, 2.0 liter, fuel injected.

Ben,

One of your vacuum lines has come adrift!  Check all the hoses that come
off the big &quot;S&quot; hose from the AFM to the air dist box and also the brake
booster line coming off the left side of the air dist box.  most
especially at the right rear corner of the engine, just ahead of the fan
shroud, check the hoses to the aux air valve.
