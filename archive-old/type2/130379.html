Hiya Chris,

As has been posted, the techs manning the DEQ stations are woefully inadequate with any of the older vehicles.  I can speak directly to that fact.  But that does tend to work to your advantage.
DEQ testing is done in what is referred to as the tri-county (Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas counties)area.  This area surrounds the Portland metro region.  Actually, if you decided to commute, Marion county is not that far away and exempt from DEQ testing altogether.
Also I do not believe that original equipment is checked for at all.  Generally the test for a vehicle of our age is simply a sensor wand up the tailpipe, a quick under hood check, and rear wheels on the dyno.  I seriously doubt that any of these &quot;techs&quot; would recognize &quot;compromised&quot; or missing equipment unless it were blatantly obvious.
Welcome to the great Pacific Northwest!

Mike
