Subject: Fuel Leak Close Call and Fireproofing Testimonial
Date: Sun, 17 Sep 2000 16:50:07 -0700
From: &quot;Thomas J. Tarka&quot; &lt;tommy_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;

(cc'ing all the air-cooled vw owners i know, in addition to 
other interested parties)

&lt;fireproofing-testimonial meta-url=&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/fireprev.htm&quot;&gt;

After seeing a photo of the remnants of a Bus in the UK
that had been demolished in less than a minute, which
had the caption &quot;Have you replaced your fuel lines?&quot;,
I thought I was on top of things when I went ahead and replaced
all the fuel lines in the engine compartment.  I had read
in the faq to check the rubber grommet/bushing around the 
metal fuel line where it passes through the firewall
but either didn't read that bit until after I took 
my bus on it's 1300 mile maiden voyage, or had been in such
a rush that I hadn't gotten around to checking it.

Right, so when the fuel pump (actually the fuel pump push-rod)
died this last Monday, I took it in stride and after nursing
the bus into the garage, figured this gave me a chance to
get some of my other &quot;dirty&quot; work done, and before heading out
to the parts store yesterday, checked  the bushing.  It was
half there (bottom half), but needed to be replaced so I 
picked up a pair of new ones at the store.  I kinda skipped
the step in the Fireproofing FAQ that says &quot;if the bushing is 
gone, check the line for scoring too, and replace as necessary&quot;
because I was in a rush (this seems to be a theme) and also
because it looked as though the bushing had just recently
come apart.   So, when I got home from the store, I figured
I'd check the line for scoring, got my fingers in there
and just scrached at the line with my fingernail.  &quot;Dammit,
it's scored, now I have to replace that to...&quot; at which
point I broke off my thought when I saw the area around the
metal fuel line start to slowly darken with the moisture of
the fuel that was leaking from the line.

Talk about close calls, if my fuel pump hadn't gone south when
it did last Monday, I probably wouldn't have a bus to talk
about any more!  Needless to say, before she moves from the
garage I'll have replaced *all* of the fuel lines and I can't
suggest strongly enough to anyone who hasn't recently done
the same, consider taking the time to do so.  If my fingernail
could cause a fuel leak, well, let's just say that's not a 
good thing and I'm glad to still have a bus.

&lt;/fireproofing-testimonial&gt;

That said, when I looked at the fuel line from the tank
to the firewall, I was puzzeled when I saw an additional
metal juncture in the line, i.e.
firewall &lt;-&gt; metal line &lt;-clamp-&gt; cloth-braided (~18&quot;) &lt;-clamp-&gt; 
	metal line &lt;-clamp-&gt; cloth-braided (~24&quot;) &lt;-&gt; tank

Insights on why there's an extra metal line in there?

In addition, the connection to fuel tank is all gunked up and I'm
not sure I want to clean that before I have the extra line
in hand that I'm going to use to replace what's already there
(don't want to break the line and have to deal with a gas leak
all over the garage and no way to fix it) -- is there anything
special I need to know about that connection or do I just need
to have some new clamps on hand?

Thanks,
	tom
