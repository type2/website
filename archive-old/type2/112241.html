Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor check....

&gt; A flashlight and a small/compact mirror will suffice and not require
&gt; removing the dizzy...(compact mirrors are better since they usually enlarge
&gt; a bit and come in a case... 8-)

May be some oil and crud back there from the oil-pressure sender too. Be
prepared to do some scrubbing. And if you take the distributor out, be careful
about the spring! (ask me how I know)
