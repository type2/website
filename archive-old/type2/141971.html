I had a brother-in-law that was a pro and competition installer. Amazing little Saturn wagon. Normal on the outside (with stock hubcaps even) and a concert hall inside. 

I love my music too. 

There is a time and place for everything! &lt;grin!&gt;

Chris

I had a loud system growing up, so the loud system does not bother me to much. I enjoy listening to a well tuned system. Especially if you take a look at the work that goes into them. Most places do have laws about the decibel level and will enforce it if they get enough complaints. I went through that as a kid and we ended up having to only play full blast at &quot;special events&quot;.
