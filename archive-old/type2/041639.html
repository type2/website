Subject: Fuel starvation?

Hi Guys,
An intermittent problem that has occasionally occurred over the last few
months has returned with a vengeance.
My 76 Fuel Injected bus last night would only run on low throttle
openings.It idles fine  and revved well in neutral,but if I opened the
throttle wider but not full to accelerate away from lights or pull up a hill
it would loose power about 2 seconds later and die untill I let off the
throttle.
It would cruise at 50mph on the flat but try to push it to 55 and it
hesitates. I had to limp home on low throttle openings.
It feels to me as though the fuel supply cannot keep up with the demand when
the throttle is opened.
It is NOT the fuel filter-newish and clear.
It is NOT a clogged fuel tank -I pulled it a few weeks ago and not a spot of
rust or dirt inside.
Is the fuel pump on the way out, functioning but with reduced output?
Has anyone had a FI fuel pump fail in this manner?
Any other suggestions as to what it could be?
The cost of a new pump has me worried, has anyone used an alternative
aftermarket (high pressure) pump or would a secondhand pump from a modern
fuel injected car work? I am reluctant to chase up and use a 20 year old
secondhand pump from a wreckers.
Any advice would be appreciated?
Jeff
