Subject: Re: [T2] Got the stripped oil plug

Why don't you just put a Keensert in it and fix it right. JB Weld works 
just fine until the next owner changes the oil.

Non-magnetic shavings can be dealt with by using axle grease on the 
drill and on the tap. Take it slow and it might take you 20 minutes to 
fix it correctly.

&gt; Probably not permanent but I wonder how long I can expect this to

&gt; there another way?

Leopards break into the temple and drink to the dregs what is in the 
sacrificial pitchers; this is repeated over and over again; finally it 
can be calculated in advance, and it becomes part of the ceremony.
