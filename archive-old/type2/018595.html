Subject: GE engine with carbs in VA yard
Message-ID: &lt;376D20AA.CBD8B27_at_cais_dot_com&gt;

Penny's junk yard in Woodbridge Virginia has a '74
camper with a GE coded fan shroud (GE engine??)
with a single carb set on it.

It looks clean and intact.  

Penny's is open on Sunday until about 3 PM as a
'pick &amp; pull'  At least you could stop by and look
at it as you go by on I-95 About 3 miles off I-95.

Penny's also has a blue/white bus with 9 passenger
seating.  White seats.
