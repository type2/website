Subject: Re: Exhaust in cab/push rod seals

&gt; So are you saying that you don't have to loosen the heads to get the push
&gt; rod tubes out. 

        Yes, on a type IV. '74 (And I'm asuming USA, where there were
no 1600dps after 1971) One of the many neat improvements the
type IV features. Is this worth everything else costing 50% to 100%
more on a type IV than a type I/II? Gee, er, maybe. :)

        For type I/II, there is a 'telescopic pushrod tube' available
from JC Whitney, etc, which proportedly offers replacement without
loosening the heads. I haven't used one so can't say. Other people 
on the list may have experience and opinions.
