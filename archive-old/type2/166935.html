Thin brass &quot;hair&quot; or stands?

Did you coat the back of the backing plates with an anti-squeal agent?

Did you chamfer the leading and trailing edges of the brake pads?

&gt; BusDepot sells at least 3 differet brands (Pagid, ceramic, some  
&gt; kind of metallic and &quot;original equip&quot;.  Anyone have experiece with  
&gt; Ate and what brand is best (I'd like to find pads with least metal  
&gt; in them- In the archives,

You'll find the Pagid pads (and other German made pads) contain a lot  
of graphite due to TUV regulations. They produce a lot of brake dust,  
work well and are quiet but only if you perform the above modifications.

I've not tried the ATE pads since the bus was new and cannot  
remember. Mintex are British.

Try the PBR Delxue pads in the green box if you have an issue with  
cleaning your rims.

This page probably best describes the tradeoffs between the 3 PBR  
compounds (not including small increases in price):

&gt; Tim Stephensd mentions metal leads to rotor wear, squeaks and the  
&gt; original pada did not last so long but cause no such rotor wear/ 
&gt; squeaks?

I'm not an auto-parts historian but I remember getting a brake job  
done on my beetle in the early 90's and the trend back then was  
towards metallic pads. They worn out the rotors/drums in no time.  
Since then, semi-metallic pads have been introduced, asbestos has  
been outlawed and ceramics introduced.
