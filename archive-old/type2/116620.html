Subject: 1972 accelerator cable?

Hello,

I am having a bad day. I have lent out my Bentley manual and the type2 
website is down. I am trying to replace my accelerator cable on my 1972 van. 
I have removed the cable from the left side dual carb and pushed it through 
the engine tin. Then went to the front and unhooked the cable underneath the 
peddle assembly. But it quickly becomes caught. Is there something else I 
need to remove?

Thanks, in advance, Phil.
