The fiberglass top on my '72 (henges at the front) would allow the roof to
sail up 8&quot; to 10&quot; at the front at 60mph+ because the henges were worn loose.

The problem I am STILL having even after cinching down the front of the top
with the nylon straps is that the fiberglass roof still osculates at
highway speed.  Most of the movement seems to be at the back on the sides.

I wonder if the reason for this could be that the fiberglass itself is worn
thinner and less rigid that it was 28 years ago, and that because of this
it is more prone to movement/vibration.  If so, is it possible that
applying a thick coat of jell-coat, or gluing wooden stiffeners inside
might be the key to eliminating the vibrations?
