Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon jump seats-put in bay bus...

We put them in daughter's bay bus- they are in nice shape- got them from 
listmember Barry B.- they pop out in seconds.  I had to fab. a spacer to 
allow
the connector near the top rear of the seats to fasten to the seatwall
behind the front seats.  Pics sent upon request (I think Barry has a 
link on the Samba)

      Just got back from ABC Used Auto Parts in Colorado Springs.  Picked
  up a set of Vanagon front seats for $25 that are in very descent
  shape.  In any case, there are two jump seats,  .
