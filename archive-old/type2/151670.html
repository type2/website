Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

Corbett,

My bet is that the hot manifold/ carb is not passing any fuel/air at 
all(or very little).

Lots and lots of fuel and air down the carb will make the intake manifolds
cool in all but the most hot conditions(when running).

Check the fuel delivery and look for anythingthat might be blocking the 
fuel air mixture.

Didja forget to take out any paper towels or anything that was stuffed 
into the intake to keep trash out before you get the new manifolds 
on?...this is what I do and have been know to install the manifold without 
taking the paper towel out!...doesn't run worth a hoot!

The carb on that side may have a stuck closed float? or trash in the idle 
passages....pull it, open it up and see...

Be sure and check the valve adj on the hot side as well.

Do your kads have a balance tube between them?...the rubber tube that goes 
on some brass fittings on the intake manifolds?

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am helping a friend try to install a set of CB performance carbs on his Type
&gt; 2 bus. I have the same set, but never installed them, currently running stock
&gt; carbs. We got them on and the bus started. After it ran for about 2 minutes or
&gt; so, I turned it off. It ran ok, but was somewhat erratic at idle. I noticed
&gt; that the right carb manifold was hot and the left carb manifold was cool to
&gt; the tough. The only adjustments that we have had time to make is to set the
&gt; volume screw two 1/2 turns out on each carb and some basic syncing of the
&gt; carbs. They are still not synced, but I wanted to get feedback about the heat
&gt; before we run it to long.
&gt; 
&gt; What does the hot manifold mean or maybe the cool manifold mean? I think the
&gt; hot side is probably the problem and not the cool side. It did not run long at
&gt; all. I thought maybe it was running lean on that side and creating more heat?

snipped&gt;
