Hi Snoopy,

I didn't quite mean it the way it may have come across.

Looking at the plugs would tell you if you're running rich or lean, or 
whether an electrode is fouled or burned. Those aren't related to the 
rings or valves, but they do have a lot to tell James about his engine.

Happy trails,

&gt;  This also gives you the opportunity to look
&gt;&gt; at the plugs, and will tell you if there's a deeper valve or ring
&gt;&gt; issue.
&gt;
&gt; Greg,
&gt; What would you look for on the spark plugs that would show signs of 
&gt; this?
&gt;
&gt; Just curious,
&gt; Snoopy
