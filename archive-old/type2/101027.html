&gt; David, here is what I recently did for a stuck adjuster on my 79. can
&gt; you get the &quot;screw&quot; part of the adjuster out? if so you can soak the

&gt; it. I would only consider taking the block off as a completely last
&gt; resort.

would have to second that, I totally rebuilt my brake system and that
included getting that _at_#*$&amp;% backing plate off, (got some real nice ones
from BustedBus)  let's just say it required the use of the precision BFH
to get it loose...... and from the looks of the design, I think you would
have to take the backing plate off the car to swap the adjuster body.
