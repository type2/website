Subject: Vaccum leak near manifold

Hello,

I can hear a leak in the manifold near the air intake, but does not seem to
be coming from the gasket.  It seem to be coming from the manifold - See
Picures: http://filebox.vt_dot_edu/users/sselin/pics/vaccum_leak.htm

I used a tube as a stethescope and am pretty sure that's where I am hearing
the leak.  Anyone have experience with this.

The vaccum is only at 8&quot; and there are no other big leaks that are obvious.

If the leak is on the manifold, can I patch it, or do I need a new part?

Thanks
Steve
