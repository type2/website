Subject: On rejuvenating front seats

I got tired of leaning my back against the wire springs on my '75 Westy. 
Though the orange plaid upholstery cloth is fine, the &quot;hair&quot; had 
disintegrated underneath. I came upon a '70 or so Bay that was to be 
scrapped but which had a front passenger seat that was little used and was 
quite well padded still, though the plastic upholtery was shot. So I took if 
for free and salvaged the hair pads. The sizes of the seat and back pads 
were about the same, so I could use both to redo the backs on both the 
driver and passenger seats of my '75. Feels great and cost me nothing! So if 
you have reasonable cloth, and find a spare seat that looks horrible but has 
good &quot;hair&quot;, snare it for a rejuvenation project.
