Subject: swivel feet valve adjusters

Hello all,
     I'm getting close to putting the heads on my rebuild and I have a
question about using swivel feet adjusters.  Will it be tricky to shim up
the rocker arms or is it just use the shims that come with the adjuster and
drive on?  It's a plain vanilla 1600DP.  I'm also interested in the
pros/cons of swivel feet VS stock adjusting nuts.  Thanks, Marcus
