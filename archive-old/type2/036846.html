Hi,

&gt; Current flow does not increase with RPM.  The points are still closed
for
&gt; the same percentage of the time, so the current stays the same.

 D'Oh!  Of course it does... The duty cycle's the same. What a stupid
thing
to write.

 My only defence is that the reason I make a habit of posting to the
list instead of P-mailing replies is so that people with brains will
pick up on stupid mistakes like this one.

Thanks, George.

Cheers,
	W.
