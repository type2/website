Subject: Missing a distributor shaft spring :-/

Well, I don't know if I even saw it when I pulled the engine apart, but
I sure can't find it now. I'm missing the spring which fits between the
distributor drive shaft and the distributor.

Can anyone tell me where to find such a thing? My local (if 35 miles
away is local...) VW parts house tells me he can't get it. Does anyone
know differently? Anyone got a spare they'd drop in an envelope for me?
;-)

Thanks for your help.
