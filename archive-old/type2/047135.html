&gt;Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.  Has
&gt;any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you recovered
&gt;from it?

My &quot;punishment cot&quot; is still there, and yes, I have slept there (I am 6 feet 
tall).

I have slept up there more than once, usually when there was a &quot;full house.&quot;

Once after a Dead show at Buckeye Lake the part of the parking area (read: 
former cow pasture) that we were in didn't start unloading until about 2 AM.  
There were four of us, and I couldn't get comfortable enough in the driver's 
seat to catch a few winks, so I moved upstairs.  I had to open (unzip) the 
window and stick my head out to fit, but it worked.  It was OK, considering 
the alternative.
