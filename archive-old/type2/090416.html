This does not sound good.  Oil in the cylinder can
only come from one place - past the piston.  If you
have this much oil, sounds like either the engine was
over heated and the rings in the (often failing)
number 3 are letting oil by.  Unless you dropped a
valve that beat a hole in your piston...

Where are you located?  Undoubtedly there is a list
member near you that can offer hands on assistance.

&gt; I just ran out to the car to check it over.  Still
&gt; have all the spark plugs.  checked the oil.  Little
&gt; more than half what it should be! even though I had
&gt; just filled it a short while ago. Don't have a
&gt; compression checker.  Went to buy one, but they had
&gt; a couple different types for testing different
&gt; things.  Not sure which I need.
&gt; When I looked on the drivers side front of the
&gt; engine (front means front of the car) There was a
&gt; lot of oil in the compartment and the spark plug is
&gt; all oily.
&gt; Guess I gotta find a place to bring it in to be
&gt; looked at.  Wasn't happy with the last place I took
&gt; it less than 2 weeks ago.  He was supposed to have
&gt; done a thorough inspection, but it looks like he
&gt; missed a couple things.  Especially since he didn't
&gt; even listen to it run.
&gt; Don't know if the oil in the compartment helps with
&gt; the diagnoses.
&gt; Thanks,
