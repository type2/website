Subject: Re: VW watercooled inline-4 conversion, was: Re: transvair kit

&gt;Hi Volks,

&gt;I'll gather information over the weekend or so, and post detailed 
&gt;information early next week.  What I can say now is: that the 
&gt;conversion utilizes the rear end of a Vanagon Diesel transmission on 
&gt;the existing Loaf tranny; that cutting and welding are required, but 
&gt;not excessively; that the radiators are cooled by electric fans 
&gt;which too are located in the engine compartment; and that the 
&gt;conversion ought to be possible with gas (petrol) inline four VW 
&gt;engines as well, as far as I know.  At least I've seen a Vanagon 
&gt;Crewcab with an 1.8 litre Golf GTI engine done by him.  I *assume* 
&gt;that 5 cyl conversions should be possible too.
&gt;
I don't know a lot about the convertion, but have seen it done. It is 
posible to get Diesel Vanagon transaxles here in the states. I would 
look on the LiMBO web page if your interested in this, Someone posted a 
lot of info and pictures of a Vanagon he calls a GTI because it has the 
Rabbit GTI engine in it. I understand that there is some difficulties in 
making the intake manifold work and constructing the rear mounts, but 
all in all it works good and provides more power. 5 cylinder is posible 
and the is a web page on this too but I don't have the URL.
