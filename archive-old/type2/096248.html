&gt; Wishful thinking IMO.  I doubt that busses have a higher actual

1.3 is national average

&gt; I'm still all for mass transit, but IMO it is only beneficial from 
&gt; a pollution standpoint if the mass transit vehicles dispense 
&gt; pollutants on the same order of magnitude as their smaller 
&gt; counterparts, and I don't think planes qualify.

not sure about planes but surface operated vehicles have been required to
meet stringent air quality standards for a number of years now, a new 40
ft transit bus only puts out the pollution level of three new midsized
cars, and many of the newer ones are run on Natural gas or are hybrid.

now to relate to the site, I have for a number of years been trying to
figure out a decent way to make a voltswagen (yes I know about the school
teacher in new england, but I don't have his budget) the hybrid design is
attractive.   consider

a 1200 or 1300 vw engine, through a hybrid drive, driving a Bus at 70mph
all day????  I think it is doable...
