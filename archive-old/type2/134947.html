Subject: RE: [T2] AVP Head mods

&gt; If they were left off at all points possibly AVP has an explanation.


I queried AVP about this and got this response:  &quot;I talked at length this
morning to Mr. Atwell. I explained that the bulletin we received over 6
years ago fron VW said that the thrust washers only need to be on Hydraulic,
so we no longer put them on solid lifter engines. I explained if he wanted
to add them we'd be happy to send some out (at no charge).&quot;
