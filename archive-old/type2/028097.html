This is for all you international travellers out there:
I have the opportunity to attend some classes in guadalajara this summer but my airline plans are becoming more confusing than they should be, and i'm thinking of just driving down there instead.  What i would like to find out is how long (realistically) should the trip take?  I don't want to go by what other non-bus drivers have said for obvious reasons and i know many of you travel down there on a regular basis.  Any suggestions on insurance, travel tips, etc?  I have never really been that far south but have travelled quite abit in northern mex, speak decent spanish and never had any problems before (short version--i'm not an obnoxious american tourist), but i know things change quite a bit south of sonora.  Advice, warnings, cautions, suggestions, etc..much appreciated!!!
Thanks in advance
Mike
