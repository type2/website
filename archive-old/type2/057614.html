Hi Volks,

There appears to be a massive internet routing or DNS problem affecting
type2_dot_com . Even the list managers cannot access AZACCESS.COM, the internet
provider where the list resides. Somehow that does not appear to be a
problem for me (from Europe).

The result is that many messages do not reach the list and many listees do
not receive any messages. Also, starting Friday, the mailfilter was
incorrectly rejecting anything mailed by a Microsoft mail program but that
has been fixed.

The routing problems also affect the web version of the list. It is not
getting updated. If you are affected by this problem you won't see this
message (so who am I writing this for ?)

I have been in mail contact with Ken and Steve. Since they cannot respond to
the list themselfes I took the liberty of sending this message to explain
this to you. The result for all not directly affected by the problems is an
unuseually low list volume.
