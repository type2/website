OK boys &amp; girls, here's an answer from someone who's done it...

I've owned a 75 bug almost since new....it's in line for restoration next
winter...

I've had the thought of FI in a 71 bus for years...have the engine, and a
complete spare FI system (just in case)...

Heating...

I needed some when the original system rusted apart....heater boxes fit right
on once the old system is removed, including the lower p-tube protectors &amp;
odd-shaped cylinder covers..._dot_use the DP tinwork here it all fits....an
extractor (single or double quite) worked well too...

Fuel system...

The &quot;T&quot; return works (A LA Mike) when you use the high pressure pump....just
be sure all the lines including the injectors are high pressure lines....(as
me how I know).

Running issues...

Harness, computer &amp; throttle-body issues are all the same as a type
IV....heck, the computer on my 75 1.8 bus engine is the spare from my 75
bug....and when I couldn't get the fuel pump to run when I was trying to
start the first rebuild, it turned out to be the same fix on the circuit card
in the throttle body as we have on the bus cards...re-drilled &amp; re-positioned
it &amp; the problem went away...go figure.

If anyone wants to sell me a clean non-running 71 Westie, I'll be glad to put
the install up on my website...been looking for something special to put out
there.

Comments anyone??
