I've seen several buses (both of the VW and school variety) with wood
stoves.  Never seen a coal stove.  Wood's plentiful here; coal's not.  I
assume David Mevis was referring to Hoover's old post about installing a
wood stove in a bus.  I know Hoover was hot on the idea (heh) of a wood
stove at one point, but I don't know if he's ever done it.  And given he
lives near San Diego, I'm not sure how much he's worked with small wood
stoves before--do you SoCal folks *ever* turn on heaters?  :-)  Wood would
be okay, I guess, but:

1) the fire box would take up a lot of interior space, especially since
you'd have to give yourself a good amount of clear space around it so you
don't ignite upholstery, trim panels, etc.  The radiant heat given off by a
wood stove can be impressive!  Perhaps there are special RV / marine wood
stoves that deal with some of these problems, and it might be worth looking
in to.

2) Wood stoves are messy.  Ash, bits o' wood, bugs and spiders, and little
wood chips.  And don't forget the smoke.  Even with a good air-tight, you
can get quite a bit of smoke when stoking, and especially when lighting it
before it gets a good draw.

3) You'd have to cut at least one really big hole in your bus for the flue.

4) Don't know how the venting for combustion air would work.  If you don't
draw in outside air, you could have a problem with pulling more oxygen into
the firebox, leaving too little for you.  Also, if it's not really air
tight, you could have a problem with CO2.

6) I personally wouldn't want to use one while driving.

7) Sounds like a huge fire hazard if you're camping up in a dry forest
area.  Even with a spark suppression chimney, I still see a live spark get
out of ours every now and then.

5) You'll have to carry a lot of wood.

8) Since you wouldn't want to carry a lot of wood, the temptation to just
burn whatever wood's around (and end up burning green wood) would be just
too great, so you'd end up creosoting your chimney and burning your bus
down in a chimney fire.  :-/

I gather you're kinda kidding about the wood stove idea, but I *have* seen
it done.  And you would get that nice romantic glow, and have a place to
put your coffee cup to kep it warm.  Apparently it works well enough for
the folks I've seen who've had one installed, 'cause they haven't ripped it
back out again.  Too much trouble, worry,  and sacrifice for me though...

We decided to go with a propane furnace in our bus for camping heat.
Small, clean, light, cheap fuel, safe.
