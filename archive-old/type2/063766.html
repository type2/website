Subject: Re: More '67 Westy minutia items sought

&gt; My '71 has one.  Obviously, I can't tell if it's EXACTLY like what a '67 is
&gt; supposed to have, but I can't imagine why VW would change something like this.

I don't know if visually it is the same but I am pretty sure it will work w/ a 
&lt;67

e 
&gt; &gt;driving.
&gt; If this is what you're talking about, it sounds like this is on the later
&gt; busses, too.  My '71 has a similar feature, though I think it's steel not
&gt; brass.  Kind of U-shaped and attaches to the wall at the bottom.

i think on a 191 the &quot;zoobie&quot; on the back of the table is platic as opposed to 
metal  and it wider and hence the female &quot;catch&quot; on the wall of a 1971 bus might 
not work w/ a thinnner pre 1968 zoobie. HAve I confused everyone yet?
