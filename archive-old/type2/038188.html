Ok, Ok,
	I have listened patiently to the woes of this poor hubcap, and I have
decided to offer a helping hand.  I plan (I hope, Ihope, I hope!) on taking
my by-then-fully-restored 75 camper to Alaska to help a friend up there in
Fairbanks work on his house this summer.  I bet few if any of you would
think that this hubcap would make it up there, but I would be glad to
transport this thing on my grand trek!  So, if the cap actually makes it out
to the West Coast sometime between now and the middle of June, I'll take it!
Just think of the great Canadian experience it would get!  I can just
picture this thing posing with myself and a big Alaskan bull Moose or
something!

&gt;I really don't care anything about this...  I suspect most everyone that
&gt;had an interest in it has lost interest, hence the lack of momentum behind
&gt;it...


I object.  My rusty but trusy Westy is all a-purr, ready to take up the
baton (er...hubcap).  Michigan is ready and waiting, captain.
