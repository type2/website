Subject: Re: Gas tank size?

Leave it to the YANKS to ask how many GALLONS their gas tank holds.

According to my owner's manual thus:

56 litres is the fuel Capacity including a 5 litre reserve.

Therefore, from E to R, is 5 litres, and from R to F is 51 liters.

Gas is sold by the liter in Canada so I can't tell you the gallon
conversions. It is about 3.3litres to a gallon or something.


PS. These are the stats on a 73, I assume they are applicable to a 71 and
maybe even a 69.

What happened to all your owner's manuals?
