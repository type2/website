Subject: Re: [T2] from 1.8 to 2 w/ hydr. lifters

Thank you for the warning about not mixing FI parts from different 
years. I shall be careful.
About hydraulic lifters, I have it now confirmed from multiple reliable 
source that an upgrade is perfectly fine.

You mentioned &quot;upgrading&quot; to a 009 distributor: not a good idea for a 
heavy bus, not a good idea for a type 4 engine.
Among other things, since you're missing the vacuum unit, you are 
missing the extra advance under load.

Best,

Sami
