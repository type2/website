Joel,
    Yes, you have assumed correctly.  My old boots crumbled apart when I
took them off to get a better look and maybe find a part #.  I do have a new
bulb housing seal and a couple of decent re-usables.  Thank you for your
advice, but the search continues.

&gt; i am assuming you mean the inside ones that cover the electrical
&gt; connections. well mine were good enough to re-use, so i dont have any info
&gt; on that part.
