Subject: Thanks and another question...(was Oil filler gasket on a pancake
 engine)

Thanks for all the answers.. It seems the gasket can be replaced but it was
suggested to remove the moustache bar (while supporting the engine) to make
the job easier.

Now for the new question..  Does anyone that has the type2 webring on their
site still have the type 2 logo?  And is the webring working anymore.  I had
some problems with the page I have it on and I can't find another site to
test it on..


Peace Brothers and Sisters,
