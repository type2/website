I want to buy a brand new 1600 upright motor.  I am really leaning towards
Ronnie of Old Volks of Arizona.  The engine is 1300.00 and around 150.00
to ship.  Any advice on getting a new motor will be incredibly
appreciated.
	I am armed with the Bently, the Idiot manual, the How-to
Rebuld a Volkswagen motor, and the Hoover Sermons.  I am still quite
nervous about this and want (need) your input.

Mahalo,
Greg
