Subject: Re: Holy dashboard

Howard,

I don't want to ruffle any feathers here, but it
sounds like a few people are saying to use the
space-shuttle to fly your kite;-)

I used a metal-cutting hole-saw that I got for $14.95
from my local hardware store. They start at around 2&quot;
dia and progress in 1/8&quot; increments and I went 1/8&quot;
over because I was using the busboys triple-guage
mount (it's just a 'beauty' plate that sits between
the dash and the guage...it's not really a mount) and
needed a little play (there is no play in the mounting
plate, so I needed a little room in the holes to
accomodate for possible miss-measuring). I attached
the hole saw to a *good* drill (i.e., heavy duty) and
it cut all 3 holes *PERFECTLY* in less than a
minute...no oil, no nothin'.

I did pre-cut the vinyl, though. Even though I went
1/8&quot; over what I needed, the guages sat in there
perfectly (even without the Busboys 'beauty' plate)
and looked stock. I almost didn't use the mounting
plate;-)


Just my .02 (trying to bring the mountain back down to
a mole-hill;-)

&gt; I am planning to fit an Oil Temperature guage in my
&gt; '70 camper - and so I
&gt; want to cut a circular hole in the dashboard.  (I
&gt; wouldn't do this if it was
&gt; a good dashboard, but it already has a bigger hole
&gt; hacked in it for a stereo
&gt; - not very good at all.)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone, know the best way to do this ?  (I want a
&gt; nice neat *Round* hole)
&gt; I'll also want to fit a lighter-socket in a similar
&gt; manner.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, has anyone got any better ideas of
&gt; where/how to fit these
&gt; items ?
