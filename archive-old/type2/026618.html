Howdy folks, I'm usually on the list as davepays_at_aol_dot_com, but I just arrived
in CO and don't yet have my computer set up at home.  We made the drive from
Springfield, MA to Colorado Springs, CO in 3 days, truckin' right along with
only a few mishaps (solenoid being silly on me and getting arrested in IL).
My baby ran beautiful (71 Westy) for the whole trip with the exception of
the starter problem.  And I've gotta give props to Colorado Springs for
having such an outstanding Aircooled VW population.  I can't go out for 5
minutes without seeing 10 or more Buses,Bugs, etc.  I love it.  Anyhow, I'm
hoping that someone around this area has a new starter for me, or can give
me a hand (making sure that is indeed what i need).  Or if someone could
point me in the right direction so i don't have to spend 85 bucks through an
aftermarket catalog.  Please write me back personally to this address,
because i won't be recieving the list for another week or so when i get my
computer all set up.  Happy Fweeming!
peace
dave
