Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Gas tank size

&gt; Forty liters. In American English, a hard ten gallons (10.57 or so).

10.5 is 67 and back. Not sure why the 'up-to-the-end-of-70' Without Guesswork says that for bay buses. 68 - 71
tanks are put in split buses to increase the capacity because they are 15.8 gallon tanks [14.5 + 1.3 reserve].
All the sales brochures for 68 - 71's have the capacity rounded up to 16 gallons. I have these tanks in my 66
and 67 buses and on fumes, I have never gotten more than 15.7 in them.
