&gt; I finally got a price on the Espar heaters as possible 
&gt; replacements for my BA6.
&gt; 
&gt; I am pretty sure the BA6 puts out 12,000 or 15,000 BTU's but 
&gt; I was trying to decide if that was overkill for the van. 
&gt; The B1LC costs $1545 CAD puts out 7,500 BTU's using .07 US 
&gt; The B3LC costs $1945 CAD puts out 12,000 BTU's using .11 US 

the Wabasto heaters are much cheaper.
