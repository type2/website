&gt;Maybe it's better if all of us remain a mystery.
&gt;
&gt;  -------------         John Siple
Nah - I don't dig cults of personality. Like Ayn Rand; lots of folks (say,
RUSH) devote their whole life to this whacko, but if they'd bothered to
actually READ about her life as a PERSON, they will find that she hardly
lived up to her missives. Might disillusion them somewhat. And no
flames,kids; my point is that if you know about John, maybe you know where
he is coming from, and how much of his advice is legit *for you*. Many
folks warn that John knew precious little about electricity, so knowing
that, you take his advice on those lines with a grain. One of your best
bets is his book &quot;The Velvet Monkeywrench,&quot; which is no doubt out of print
(mine is autographed by John AND Eve Muir!! $5 at Half-price books, so go
digging). This is his vision of a 'cosentual'(sic) society. It's
interesting, maybe a good idea, but practical? John  thought so; he
certainly believed we would all be better off in his system than the one he
saw around him. And who knows?
  Anyways, I think I grok John a bit more having read it, and can often see
just  WHY  he does things one way, and not another - it's because of his
mindset; sometimes just a resistance to what he sees as &quot;bad&quot; technology,
sometimes just a reflection of his laid-back culture of Santa Fe.
So yes, I would like MORE info on John - not just to weed out info that
might be 'suspect,' but because he is an interesting PERSON.
