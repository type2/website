Good question, one I was looking for an answer for less than 1 week ago. I
found the answer by reading the homepages for the various US tyre
manufacturers/distributors which state that  the 'standard' tyre without any
aspect ratio in the size (185R14 or 185SR14 for example) is .82 which, on
the current example, gives a overall diameter of 25.94&quot; (plus or minus a bit
for tyre inflation.
There is some excellent reading available at these sites - look for the
section that deals with 'reading the sidewall'.
One of the more useful URL's is: www.dunloptyre_dot_com/tt101_sizing.html

Good luck,
