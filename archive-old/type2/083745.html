Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

It indeed sounds like you have a bad combination then.
Oh well, you will get used to pulling the engine.


&gt; In response to Karl's inquiry, my pressure plate does not have the ring on it around the fingers.  It does seem that when I pull the lever on the trans., it takes a bit for the T/O bearing to make contact with the pressure plate.  I think the assumption is right in that no amount of washers looks like a cure for this.  Is my only option here to pull the motor, and change the pressure plate?  Although I hate to face this cold truth, it looks to be that way....Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn_dot_com
