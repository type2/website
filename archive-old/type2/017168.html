    Since I was living in WI, and going to Milwaukee every week, I
bought a good bit of stuff from Mofoco, but quit buying from them
because it seemed like they constantly were quoting me one price over
the phone, but then charging me a higher price when I got there and
picked it up -- with excuses like &quot;Oh we're out of that brand, this is
all we got.&quot;, etc. 
     Plus I found cheaper prices for most stuff from RMMW, and now Bus
Depot. Don't have any idea of the quality of their rebuilds, but just
judging from past experience, I'd never buy one from them myself.
