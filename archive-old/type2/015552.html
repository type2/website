I can only guess that the commutator is worn and rough. What else could eat
the brushes?? Poor quality brushes perhaps, but truing and polishing the
commutator might put things right. If the commutator and brushes are not
mated properly, it can account for the low and varying output. Old and
porous solder at the armature wires will pass fewer electrons as well as
generate excess heat that will increase brush and bearing wear. I would go
for a genuine Bosch reman and be done with generator problems for a long
time. 

I don't see the need or advantage of an alternator with a stock system. It
won't solve your problems any better than a new/reman generator. Compared
to a generator that has served a full life, either will be a vast
improvement.

&gt;A few days ago I had a generator light, so I replaced the brushes.  I
&gt;though this odd as the brushes were only a year old and about half worn
&gt;out.  The new brushes fixed the light problems, so I counted the problem
&gt;as fixed.
&gt;
&gt;During the 400 mile drive yesterday, I noted the voltage as being rather
&gt;low, dipping as low as 12.0V (measured while driving from a circuit direct
&gt;from the battery).  Turning the headlights on made no difference in the
&gt;voltage, so the generator was putting out.  The night section of the trip
&gt;came along and the voltage increased to 12.7V.  Upon getting to Carson
&gt;City (and my Dad's house) I was shocked to see voltage of 11.7V, but the
&gt;generator light was still out.  I checked the generator, and the brushes
&gt;were almost completely worn out!  I shut the engine down and restarted,
&gt;and now the generator light stays on.
&gt;
&gt;Review of symptoms:
&gt;1. Low voltage (12.0-12.5V) but still charging.
&gt;2. Very rapid brush wear.
&gt;
&gt;Any list wisdom on a possibe cause?
&gt;
&gt;I was planning to switch to an alternator, but I was saving that job for
&gt;the next time the engine was out.  It looks like I might be doing that job
&gt;a bit sooner than expected!
&gt;
&gt;I'll have to resolve this before I go anywhere, but I have a week here to
&gt;work on it, and I have transportation.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions of VW parts places in the Reno/Carson City Nevada area?
&gt;I'll probably need a complete alternator conversion kit and the tool to
&gt;remove the filler from the generator stand.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions welcomed!
&gt;
