&gt; Listees,
&gt;  
&gt;  Has anyone done this or given some thought to upgrading the rear lap-belts
&gt;  to shoulder belts? What would a good anchor point be?  Sami

Well I used to have a 73 and that already had 3 point seat belt fittings for 
the outer seats of the rear bench which were fitted by VW.

So unless your Type 2 is from a year before they were fitted (at worst pre 
73) or started out as a panel van rather than a minibus or kombi  your bus 
should already have the fittings you want (at least for the outer seats)

You should also find that there are fittings for seat belts on the central 
bench too - but (obviously) only the seat farthest from the sliding door is 
three point.

To fit three point belts to the other rear seats you would need to fit some 
side to side bracing to support the shoulder mounting of the belt

Good luck
