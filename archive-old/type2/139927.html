Subject: Blinkers &amp; headlights

A few weeks ago my blinkers stopped working and, after checking the fuses,
I ordered a replacement relay. In the meantime I noticed that every time I
started the Bus (a '71) the high beam light was on. This led me to think
there might be something wrong with the turn signal arm. Then, the last
time I drove it the headlights stopped working. This weekend I'm going to
spend some time tracking down the problem but if anyone has encountered a
similar problem I'd appreciate any insight.
