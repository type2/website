Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops? 

Rob Henley said::

&gt;&gt;I hate the placement of the table in the
&gt;&gt;late (76-79) Westies, laying on the rear cushion. Whenever you go camping
&gt;&gt;the bed won't expand with the table or leg in the way, and there is no 
&gt;&gt;place
&gt;&gt;to put it if you are sleeping, so I usually leave it at home.

I don't use the large Westy table top.  I use a SMALL (front) Vanagon table 
top in my '78.

I usually keep the small Vanagon table top installed in the rear.  It fits 
snug against the side, behind the large cabinet, and leaves room for two 
rear seated passengers.  Also, he left sitting passenger can use the table 
top for a flat work area (news papers, snacks, a reading book, opened map or 
Gazetteer.)

When I want to open my rear folding bed, I put the table leg in the 'spare 
tire compartment' behind the driver seat, and lay the table top vertical 
behind the passenger seat. I fasten the Vanagon table top to the back of the 
passenger's seat with a simple bungee cord.
