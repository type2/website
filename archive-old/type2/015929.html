I'd say you're trying to kill, try turning your idle up, or tuning up
whichever is appropriate.
If that doesn't work...good luck

&gt;Thanks for everybody's help on the wobbly speedo.  Now, driving my '71
today, my Oil warning light came on only at idle after about 3 miles.
Every time I came to a complete stop it would come on but even the
slightest touch of the accelerator and it would go off.  Is this just a low
oil problem or something more serious? Please help!
&gt;Thanks,
