&gt; we should start a chart of this, like with the fuel consumption chart...... 

not a bad Idea, I once figured that my oil temp went up 20degrees for
every 30 degrees ambient.  eg  at 70 degrees outside and oil temp at 210,
if the temp went to 100 degrees engine went to about 230.  but this was
VERY Crude and not documented

&gt; anything over 240 and id think about switching to at liest part synthetic 

I use 100% synthetic

&gt; oil, it can handle the heat alot better. Then again it costs alot more and 
&gt; most vw's leak oil anyway...

not !
  I have made it a mission not to accept leaking on my 2L engine and it
doesn't!   good valve cover gaskets, good pushrod tube seals and no leaks.
I doubt if I put a quart in between oil changes and I use 5-50 synthetic
and run 5,000 between oil change.
