&gt; This may look like a Friday topic, but I assure you it is not.
&gt; 
&gt; The operator of a type 2 is the only part of the bus that ties
together 
&gt; the engine, the brakes, the transmission, the steering, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I have found that the operator of my bus (me) tends to have higher
blood 
&gt; temperatures and pressures when operating the bus in the company of
other 
&gt; vehicles: people who get p*ssed off when I don't go 0 to 50 in 4
seconds 
&gt; when the light turns green, and who so indicate by passing me on the 
&gt; right in a burst of speed. 

Well, if the &quot;ucsd&quot; in your address indicates San Diego, then you must
realize that passing on the right is normal procedure here in the
Golden State.  In other states (particularly those in the East)
passing on the right is frowned upon, except in New York City where
even the sidewalk is fair game for the passing motorist.
&gt; 
&gt; (I'm just guessing that my blood temp rises, having declined to
install a 
&gt; temperature guage in either my dipstick or my sump while driving).
&gt; 
&gt; So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and 
&gt; pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.

The first thing to realize is that your bus is never going to be as
spritely in traffic as other vehicles.  There are a only few vehicles
that are slower.  Most other motorists view you as a relatively
stationary object and that's fine.

Best thing is to take on a regal attitude.  You're seated on a high
throne with an excellent view of the outside world.  The rabble swarm
about as you smile benignly down upon them.  Occasionally one will try
to get your attention by waving their finger at you or yelling, but is
it really worth diverting your royal attention for such trivia?

A humorous thought, that, but not too far from my driving attitude. 
If you get uptight the only person you're hurting is yourself :)
