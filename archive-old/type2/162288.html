Subject: Re: [T2] Megasquirt on 82 Vanagon

Ok,

So here is what I sent back this morning....not megasquirt V3, but an 
earlier version....with pics...in a camper.

Ed's site is still up and should provide you with the numbers you need.

Compare pressures and injectors and go from there.

Great pics also!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I'd like to follow this as well. While I have no need to mess with the FI in
&gt; &gt; the Guac, it's something I've always been interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; Me too.
