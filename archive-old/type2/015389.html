Letsee, 2.0 FI on a carbed 1.7. That's different cam profiles, different
valve sizes, different distributors, different capacities, different
combustion chambers, different compression ratios.

Cross your fingers and start swapping parts. Can you say &quot;iterative
process&quot;? Stock is ALWAYS the shortest route to lowest cost street
drivability, ALWAYS. Cause it was designed by a team of engineers everyone
of which is far more skilled than 99.9% of the listees here, including me,
an engineer who recognizes excellent design and function when he sees it.
When results count in the least amount of time/money, think stock. Your
wallet will love you for it, and so will your vehicle, and any potential
buyer with a modicrum of value recognition when you decide to sell. 

But you can always hope for a clod buster to fall off the farm truck in
your block. God knows there are enough of them to go around. Particuarly
when das maschine has a reputation and long history of excellant service,
therefore a large following, and a mystic of functional ambiance when 30+
years old. 

As long as you resonably MAINTAIN everything in spec per factory interval
or better, which for the large majority of us is a servere use schedule of
inspections, your cost per mile for the interval of ownership will bring
tears to the eyes of anyone with a roan Scottish tint to their hair. Just
think of it. No tow bills to the shop from hell to have it fixed wrong and
re-fail in short order, no late to work screwdriver pokin' slang creation
sessions, no unforseen problems attacking your budget due to inadvertent
failure founded in lack of maintenance. It is so much cheaper to over
maintain your vehicle than to under maintain it, when you honestly consider
ALL the costs.
