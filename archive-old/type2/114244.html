Subject: Window Stuck

My passenger side window is stuck in the up position.  Whenever I turn the
window crank it just clicks.  After looking in the archive, I see that I
need to replace the entire unit as a whole and I have a 77 that I'm using
for parts.  Does anyone have any suggestions to make this go easier?  After
looking in the Bentley it looks as if there are going to be problems in
getting the thing out and then back in again.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,
