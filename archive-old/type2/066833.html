I must tell you the story of my friend Fred, who used to get odd jobs 
driving his VW Kombi. The Adelaide Zoo was due to receive a pair of 
exotic penguins from Adelie Land in Antarctica, and they gave Fred 
the job (paid 100 dollars) of driving down to the port to take delivery 
of the animals and bring them back to the zoo in the city of Adelaide. 
 
Everything was going along fine. Fred had picked up the pair of exotic 
penguins and was taking them to the zoo when the fan belt of his Kombi 
broke, just a few miles before the city of Adelaide. He flagged down
another VW bus, and explained his predicament to the driver, named
Bruce: 
 
&quot;I've got two exotic penguins in the back of my bus. I'm  supposed to 
take them to the zoo, but my vehicle's broken down. I'll give you 30 
dollars if you'll take them to the zoo.&quot; 
 
&quot;No problem,&quot; said Bruce. So, off he went with the two exotic penguins 
from Adelie Land in the back of the second VW van. 

Fred ended up getting his vehicle repaired, then he drove calmly into 
Adelaide. He was not unhappy; in spite of his breakdown, he'd made 
70 dollars on this affair. He sat down for a drink in a coffee-house in 
the middle of the city. All of a sudden, what does he see there, walking 
along the footpath in front of the coffee-house ? Bruce and the two exotic 
penguins from Adelie Land! Fred is furious: 
 
&quot;What the hech are you doing here with the penguins ? I gave you 30 
dollars to take them to Adelaide Zoo !&quot; 
 
&quot;Calm down, mate,&quot; says Bruce. &quot;I took them to the zoo. They loved it. 
Got a bit of money left over. Thought I'd take them to see a movie...&quot;
