Subject: [T2] Events page updated

Just a line to say that any events emailed to me have been updated to the
events page, can anyone wanting to post an event send the date address &amp;
contact details only. There's not room for extended details etc... &amp; to
scroll through it all would back the page unusable, also several people have
sent flyers &amp; again sorry but they hog too much room to post.

Thanks
