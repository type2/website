Subject: Re: [T2] Yokohama Snow Performance?

Thought I might add my thought's to this subject seeing as I'm running a
set of these tires as we speak---

Price is right---

The ride they offer is terrible--really harsh--like riding on a brick.

The wet weather handling is poor---
The ice and snow handling is like having 4 ball bearings for tires--
I had mine siped, and it hepled a bit--but not much

Great dry weather tire.

The longevity of the tires is short---
They wear out on the outside edges real quick--the center of the tire
doesn't regardless of how much air your running in them--I've tried
everthing.
It's just the way the are.

And for the icing on the cake--there is zero--zip--nada warranty on them
because thay are deemed a commercial tire--
What you buy--is what you get--there yours.

I believe there is better out there for the money--or for just a bit
more----

Next round it's Michelins, no more white knuckled, highway surfing in
the wet or snow for me--

Take Care,

Terry

Jason, 

my experience with the Y356 in the snow was horrible. i don't think
those tires are rated for Mud + Snow. 
they do work well in the rain, though &amp; for the price a great tire.
