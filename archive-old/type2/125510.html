Subject: Re: [T2] Timing light suggestions?

From another group:

I bought the adjustable timing light from Harbor Freight early this year to 
replace my non-adjustable ones.  Works great!  Seems to be a little cheap in 
construction but not any worse then most of the average timing lights out 
there.  Plus it does what other adjustable timing lights do for only $25.00! 
I've double checked its accuracy with my other lights and appears to be dead 
on.  So hell, if it only last 5 years, and the expensive ones at $90.00 last 
ten, I can buy three, be five years ahead and still have money in my pocket. 
I'm not recommending this for professionals, but for the average owner who 
only uses it 6-12 times a year; it's a great deal!
