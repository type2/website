&gt; Hi Volks ,
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to change my original speakers (front and back) by a good (not
&gt; too expensive) ones.
&gt; I would like to know if one of you guys have some nice experience with a
&gt; brand on a vanagon.
&gt; I am a jazz-rock musician (my music style is weather report , jaco
&gt; patorious , Stanley Clark , step ahead , .....) and would like a 4&quot;
&gt; speakers which could reproduce the bass sound nicely.
&gt; Thanks for any info.
