I think everyone's made some decent points, I'll bow out with my response to John's post which was this:

John Connolly wrote:
&quot;...I said it's more likely that the owner of a hydrualic equipped flat-4 aircooled engine would have that happen &lt;fiery death&gt; than one with solid lifters (that adjusts their valves at regular intervals).&quot;

I would agree with respect to the typical showroom smiling family circa 1978 on the brochures we've seen. 

But consider your audience, the type2 list, a fairly well-educated group. We should be able to handle it.
