Subject: RE: [T2] bus trailer hitch &quot;receiver&quot; adapter?

&gt; I just got a new european trailer hitch for my 79 bus from Bus Depot
&gt; yesterday (thanks Ron!) and I'm wondering if anyone has
&gt; found/fabricated a
&gt; &quot;receiver&quot; style adapter for it yet??
&gt;
&gt; Any FLAPS adapters already out there that fit with some minor tweaking?
&gt;
&gt; Any templates on the web yet for something I can build and then bolt up?
&gt;
&gt; Ron, any customer feedback yet on successful conversions?


While the Bus hitch is relatively new, I've been carrying a Vanagon version
of it for several years, so the solutions customers have used on them would
apply to the Bus one as well. While there is no off-the-shelf receiver
adapter available that I have found, several customers have reported having
local welders weld a receiver to the vertical plate for around $50-$70, with
good results.  Also, there is a Land Rover dealer that sells a &quot;tow jaw and
pin assembly&quot; for $39 that can be used to make the hitch accept U.S. style
tow balls (thus allowing you to use sizes other than the 2&quot; ball that's
included). That item can be found at
