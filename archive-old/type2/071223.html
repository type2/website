I don't think its smart to wash the rust out of my gas tank with the same 
stuff that caused the rust, water.  I am just running gas through and 
collecting it, and screen out the rust and running it through again, i'm 
really only damaging myself, not the environment too much, but I don't think 
I'm helping much to stop the rust, just to get some of whats in there, out.

&lt;&lt; If it were me, and the tank was still in the bus, I would bung up the
 outlet with some sort of cork or fid (see the Hoover CD for a delightful
 essay on fids). Then I would slosh it out with detergent and water as best
 I could by rocking the bus. Then I would drain it and immediately rinse
 with water, then drain it and immediately rinse with about a gallon of
 isopropyl alcohol (probably less than $10 at a local printers' supply),
which will dry it. &gt;&gt;
