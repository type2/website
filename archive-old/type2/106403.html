&gt; Bob and all,
&gt; Maybe I should clarify what I am trying to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Bob you said &gt;&quot; right but rpm is not the only measure of enigne work, the
&gt; rpm might go
&gt; &gt; down but the torque required will go up...longer fulcrum, less work more
&gt; &gt; distance, shorter fulcrum, more work less distance bottom line is still&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This is true, but my concern is to keep the rpms down for cooling puposes.

ahh, this is different, I understand, however the engine will probably be
making slightly more heat to disapate 

&gt; I have a 1904cc in my '71 that was built for torque. I have been
&gt; experimentingt with the rpms and reading the temperature and found that my
&gt; engine runs cooler at 3200 rpms.  I would like to reduce the rpms for
&gt; cruizing on the highway to keep the engine cooler. Currently, the rpms are
&gt; 3750 at 65 mph which IMHO is too high.  I would like to get it down to 3200
&gt; at 65 mph but this will take more that changing tire sizes.

right but will changing tire size help since the only thing that really
matters is the total rolling size, so if tire is smaller but wheel is
larger the total may be the same, there is only so much that can be
stuffed into a type 2 wheelwell.....years ago when I wanted to do
something similar I found I had to cut out the wheelwells to get the
larger wheel/tire combo in there...(my 65westy) since I hadn't built an
engine to handle this the engine longevity was affected I'm sure.
