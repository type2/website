Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

From: George Lyle [mailto:glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com] 
&gt; Yeah, there are a lot of gadgets that are sold &quot;for emergency use only&quot;,
etc.  You should have no problems if you follow the instructions.
Personally, I think it's better than throwing all those little bottles in
the landfills.

As well as the fact that the 1 lb'ers are going for $4.00 plus in some of
the stores.
