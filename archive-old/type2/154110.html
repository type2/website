Lol!  Talk about blowing a head gasket!

But you're assaulting the wrong Rich White Honkey -- my wife drives an Audi
Allroad biturbo.  Todd's wife wants the Mexi-Bus.

I don't suppose all the rich white racist honky's that drive Touareg's
would mind if I called them rich white racist honky's that waste
natural resources with their big unnecessary SUV's? Or would that be
politically incorrect?

Claiming someone's PC-ness is a tactic used by extreme right wingers
to stifle honestly held opinions and debate on public civility, Mr
Ames. As in, &quot;ugh, that's too PC therefore it's not a valid opinion on
my racist comment that stereotypes Mexicans&quot;.

Bus content! Leave it to some rich honky to say that his wife demands
that they be the first on their block to find a way around the laws of
the US and other countries to smuggle a Brazilian Type 2 across the
border.
