You might try a magnet on the end of a flexible shaft.

Just a BTW, when I pulled my motor apart that I got out of the junk yard for the
conversion that I'm working on, I found not one, but two spark plugs AND a spark
plug socket banging around in there.  The mechanic on that engine must have been a
tad on the lazy/sloppy side.  Maybe that explains the bolt dropped down the intake
manifold and left there to work its way down to the intake valve where a nice hunk
was taken out of the valve seat.
