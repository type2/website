Subject: fire almost

The 12 volt wire that goes from the coil to the automatic
choke heater came loose yesterday. The wire somehow jiggled
out of the connector.  It shorted to ground on the carburetor
body near the throttle. This, of course, made the ignition
quit, so we pulled over to see what was the matter.  Luckily, 
there was no fire and it was easy to fix. Had the carburetor
been leaking at all, as they sometimes do when the throttle 
lever is worn, I'm sure that there would have been a little 
gasoline condensate on its surface.

Just a warning to everyone to check that wire every now and 
then.
