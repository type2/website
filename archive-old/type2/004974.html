&gt; The top
&gt; bolt on my rear shock just spins without unscrewing... I am actively
&gt; trying to get the bolt out--I can't grab the nut end with a wrench or
&gt; vice grips; I'll probably have to cut it off.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have suggestions for repair? Instead of welding the a frame
&gt; support back on, I was thinking of welding a bolt in there and then
&gt; attaching the shock with a nut...
&gt;

The weld-nut is accessable if you remove the gas tank panel. There is a
little room at the end of the gas tank, but not much. Yes, if you get the
bolt out, you could cut the head off a long bolt and weld it in FROM the
outside. Then slide the shock on and use a nut. I would not try to weld it
from the gas tank side.
