Subject: Re: [T2] update: stuck in chico

You really need to get a timing light. Even static timing will be
better than nothing. But a real strobe will tell you much about how
the distributor is doing.

A quick check for vacuum advance is to pull off the cap, pull the
vacuum line from your carb, and suck! If you see the vacuum lever
pulling on things you've at least got vacuum advance. If you have an
009 you need a timing light to see.

You might want to check your carb mixture too. Too lean will cook up
your engine.

This kind of situation is why I have so much crap in my bus. From a
spare loaded dizzy (009.. ugh) to clutch and throttle cables to
various gaskets to a timing light and tach/dwell and multimeter. I
refuse to be stuck again.
