Subject: Re: [T2] Where are all the busses?

Hi BuH,

That sounds like the exact opposite of the typical routine here in  
the rust belt. As soon as the roads taste salty, the buses hide away  
for the winter. I can usually coax out a few hardcore camping  
fanatics for the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout, but the majority  
here aren't seen between November and April.

Even in the summer I can go a week or two without spotting a &quot;wild&quot;  
type2. Vanagons are plentiful enough, but a Baywindow spotting is  
noteworthy in these parts. A road-going splitty is a definite rarity.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
