Subject: the pushrods have been buffed

and look all nice and shiny.  They probably won't look too nice after 
the heat makes 'emm all funky colored, but that's ok.

I took them all to a deburring wheel and a buffing wheel w/ 140 grit and 
it cleaned them up nice.  I had failed to mention in my other email that 
these are from a type4 engine and are aluminum so they don't rust. 
Also, they come stock unpainted, at least I didn't notice any kinda 
paint on the 16 that I have here...

Mike
