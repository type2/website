&gt; Maybe I would have been better off to go with a new
&gt; progressive (new duals are out of my price range.)


Not sure what your price range is, but I do have brand new N.O.S. German
carbs for the '72-74 bus for $369.95/pair. This is about half of the former
price, and, I think, not much more than the progressive goes for.
