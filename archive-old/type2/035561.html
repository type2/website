Hello all,

I've been a list lucker for some time now, secretly longing for a vw bus.
Now I would like to get your responses and opinions on a bus I have an
opportunity to buy.

I was originally looking for a late 70's bus, but came across a 1983
air-cooled Vanagon. It has 63,000 original miles and has always been
garaged according to the elderly second owner.
Body and interior are in near mint shape.
Engine seems to run strong, although I don't know much about type 4's.
(The wife has a 76 beetle convert that I am familiar with.)
The Vanagon is an automatic, I wasn't crazy about this until I drove it.
Uphill and on the parkway it actually does ok, not a speed demon, but ok.
More power than another one with an auto trans we looked at.

One problem I did notice that when stepping hard on the brakes you get a
rythmic scraping sound, relative to rolling speed. The brakes seem to work
fine and have no sound when slowing gradually, but, if you step hard
you get the sound.

Another problem was no heat whatsoever. I looked underneath and saw what
appeared to be the heat control valves connected to an accordian hose on one
side and nothing on the other. Wierd thing was I couldn't find any place where
the other end of the heat exchanger would go. There were two flat rectangular
boxes on each side of the engine, but they didn't look like the exchangers on the
beetle engine. (Just replaced the cables on the beetle so I'm familiar with them.)
Owner of the Vanagon said he was getting an exhaust smell thru the heat so he
had something disconnected, but wasn't sure what. Can anyone enlighten me on this?

Oh, are the fuel lines something to be concerned about in this model year?
&gt;From what I could tell, the lines to the injectors were metal not fabric or rubber
like on the wife's beetle.

The price is $5800. and it is firm.

We are looking to use this bus to travel and camp in, perhaps a vw show
here and there. So any opinions, comments, things to look out for, etc. would be
greatly appreciated.

Sorry for the long post.
TIA
Steve
