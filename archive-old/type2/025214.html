Hello W;  If your problem is an exhaust leak, it will be high lighted if
you run the engine, and cover the exhaust outlet then run your hand all
around the exhaust system to feel for leaks.  Of course don't expose
yourself (or anyone) to excessive amounts of exhaust gases, do this in the
outdoors, don't burn your hands, block or chock the tires if your E-brake
doesn't work.  It's a good idea to check the condition of the exhaust
system regularly, as the heater draws air from the engine compartment to
heat the van body, and if the exhaust system is leaking, it will draw
carbon monoxide in to the vans interior, very dangerous.  A lot of sounds
that the van develops come about slowly, and get worse slowly, and we don't
notice it as easily as if it happened all of a sudden.
