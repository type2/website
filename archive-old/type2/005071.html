Subject: Bore stuck on head .. help!

Hi

I decided to clean the engine whilst out of the bus, removed all the parts,
discovered the exchangers had a missing stud.  Today I discovered the plug
in Number 4 is not screwed all the way in (only about half way), tried to
put it and wouldn't go so in short I decided to remove the head, an now I am
in trouble...

The PO has &quot;Stuck&quot; the pushrod tubes in with some black sticky gunk, looks
like some king of silicone sealant, the studs on the exhaust ports are a
complete mess, mixture of 8mm and 10mm threaded rod, there is some damage
around the threads.  The missing one is just a hole no thread at all.

The biggest problem of all is that when I pulled the head (after removing
all the black gunk) number 4 cylinder bore came with it, it is stuck fast to
the head.  It seems to be stuck with what looks like thick Carbon deposits,
caused no doubt by not having the plug screwed in properly.  So..

1..  How do free the bore from the head?

2.   Is there anything else I should look for on this head before deciding
what to do with it

3.  Is the bore/ piston OK having been removed in this way?

thanks
