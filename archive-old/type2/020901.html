&gt; wondering if there are any buses/vanagons with two sliding doors? Anybody
&gt; seen one (or two)?

That would be a model 215, panel van. I've never seen one in person, but the
listing is in the parts books. In fact, I've only seen a couple of model 211's
here in the midwest, a 69 and a 71. Like pickups 71 would have been the last
year for panels in the US.
