Subject: Mechanic Recommendation in GLASGOW SCOTLAND

Hi

Had the misfortune to overheat on the M74 heading into Glasgow on Thursday
afternoon but the good fortune to get an RAC man who insisted on taking me
to a garage called Capaldi &amp; Milliken on 27 Anson Street (off London Road)
in Bridgeton (0141 554 0113). They are all fantastic guys and real VDub
enthusiasts who hold plenty of parts and if they had a second hand part
better than one on my bus insisted on changing the part for no charge. They
were so good and so knowledgeable about my 1973 Porsche 1700 engine that I
wish they were a bit nearer my home in Nottingham. I was back on the road
within 24 hours with a bus running a damn sight better than it was before it
overheated and the guys at the garage were full of suggestions on how to
spend my enforced stay in Glasgow.

Just thought I'd let you all know...if you ever break down in the
highlands - get a tow to Glasgow and tell them I sent you.
