To those of you in the area....

I have found a great junkyard south of Fredericksburg, VA.  It is in 
Massaponex, VA and is about 1:30 hours south of DC.

The name is Banks Foreign located at 8901 Jefferson Davis Hwy (route 
1.)  They have 5 buses total, one being a camper.  The camper is a 75, 
there is a 77 bus, a 72 and I don't remember the 2 others...but they are 
NOT splitties.  There are a few Vanagons as well.

I took a whole mess of stuff for my 75 Westy...put it all in a box...and 
the guy said, &quot;$50...I don't feel like looking.&quot;  Good deal, considering 
how large the box was!

Anyway, just thought I would pass the info on to the list.

Happy hunting!!
