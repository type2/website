Subject: Re: [T2] Tire sizing to gear down tall tranny for 75?



&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; How does a 205 series tire wind up a smaller diameter than a 185?  As 
I
&gt; understand it, the 3-digit number is the tire width in millimeters (1 
inch =
&gt; 25.4 mm), and the second number is the sidewall height expressed as a
&gt; percentage of the tire width. I may be wrong in this interpretation 
though,
&gt; and would welcome an expert correction if that's the case.
&gt; 
&gt; With this formula a 205/70 tire has a sidewall height of 143.5mm, 
whereas a
&gt; 185/75 tire has a sidewall height of only 138.75mm.

The number is only a guideline to a range of dimensions.  If a tire 
falls into the range, it gets that size.  That's why dimensions tend to 
vary between brands.
 
&gt; I ran a set of 14&quot; 185/60 series sport tires from a BMW on my 1973 
Westy for
&gt; a few months.  I needed tires and they were free to a good home, and 
it was
&gt; a while before I had the funds for something more reasonable.  They 
put the
&gt; bus about an inch closer to the ground and improved acceleration 
immensely;
&gt; but the top speed and fuel consumption took a major hit. I got rid of 
them
&gt; as soon as I could afford a half-decent set of 185/75's.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now my westy is sitting on its rims in my garage, when the 
weather
&gt; warms up I'll be slipping on a set of C-rated 185/75 Kumho's so I can 
ride
&gt; nice and smooth down to EveryBus this spring.

I think that the 185/75s will be too small, and the C range is not high 
enough in this size.  Check the sidewall and make sure that the Maximum 
Load is 1540 pounds or greater.

You want a straight 185 section tire, which has an 82 aspect ratio.
