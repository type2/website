Subject: RE: [T2] funny sign

&gt; Drove up to a red light today behind a big,
&gt; military-looking sort of hi-tech dump truck...
&gt; when I saw the big, black on yellow sign across
&gt; the  back:  STAY 50' AWAY.  I had to back over 
&gt; 3 cars! 


My favorite is the road signs I've seen down south, which say RESUME SAFE
SPEED.  Which, I suppose, means that prior to reaching the sign you were
permitted to drive at an unsafe speed...
