&gt;         We'll save a spot out front for the hearse for the show.
&gt; I want to ramble a little to you about Bessies history, I could write a
&gt; couple of books, so bear with me. Hopefully you will just take out of
&gt; all this what you need. Call it diamonds in the rough. I would be glad
&gt; to consult in these final stages, maybe even pick up a brush. I also
&gt; have a banner that was made to fly over her, which I still use, but I
&gt; could sell it and make another one if you are interested. Well donate a
&gt; lot of things also, because we are psyched to have the legend continue
&gt; to grow.
&gt;         First, I have some ideas about presenting it as a museum. I have
&gt; countless audio tapes of shows with The Mother Earth's Healing Circus,
&gt; it is a huge collection varied music, and storytelling, and storytelling
&gt; with jazz music, folk singers etc. It is all original music, and these
&gt; tapes tell the story of Bessie's history and the history of the circus
&gt; as well as anyone one person could. I have always pictured an old-time
&gt; horn-style speaker mounted somewhere on Bessie, with a tape deck inside
&gt; that can play all of the old circus shows that were recorded live. The
&gt; fold out doors can be lined with framed pictures of all the old shows,
&gt; some of which will tell about the miles put on Bessie. I think there is
&gt; also a real possibility of marketing the old t-shirts, tapes and c.d's.
&gt; I have an original signed lithograph poster that I can get you of one of
&gt; our more well-known shows in AZ. Bessie toured with this show to New
&gt; Orleans, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Ashville, NC., San Francisco, Wavy
&gt; Gravy's Camp Winnarainbow, Seattle Wash., Boulder, Co., Montreal,
&gt; Canada. She's been all over. The reason I sold the original roof rack
&gt; was 2 reasons, one we were absolutely broke and just barely hobbled home
&gt; from tour with her, but the other reason, and THIS IS NO EXAGERATION, We
&gt; travelled from Kansas City with 2 unicycles, a bike, a sitar, a banjo,
&gt; guitar, mandolin, saxaphone, clarinet, violin, harp, flute, djembe drum,
&gt; a pair of stilts for Sir Real-the tall man, a trunk full of costumes, a
&gt; box full of microphones and chords, an 18-month old child, and 4 adults
&gt; and all of their personal clothing and belongings. I kid you not, the
&gt; roof-rack was stacked so high that she looked like a small mountain.
&gt; &gt;From the low plains to Boulder, Co. 35 mph most of the way. When I got
&gt; bac, I said, &quot;Bessie is too old to carry a load like that, so I'm gonna
&gt; get rid of this roof rack, coz as long as I have it, I'm gonna push the
&gt; limits. Half way through our journey, we realized that we had gotten
&gt; scabies from some children we worked with at a kids camp, we were happy
&gt; to make some changes. I personally like her better with the star bellied
&gt; roof, and we used to always joke and say she drove faster with that
&gt; bright yellow. The roof rack funded her yellow roof paint-job. We used
&gt; to joke how the spare looked like a donut on her roof. One time, me and
&gt; Willows, my girlfriend at the time, got in a huge argument while driving
&gt; Bessie, and all of the sudden, the windsheild wipers turned on. Willows
&gt; said, &quot;Stop playing around!&quot;, and I said, &quot;I'm not, Bessie has a mind of
&gt; her own&quot; God, the electrical system was spaghetti, I can only take half
&gt; the credit, she was already on a crash course electrically when I got
&gt; her, which is a whole other story.
&gt;         I had an '80 West-falier, air-cooled with all those great Porshe-Boshe
&gt; parts that malfunctioned just as often, but cost 10 times more. And
&gt; melted a valve. I had been planning to go to Oregon to meet with Ken
&gt; Kesey (he was one of the Merry Pranksters that Tom Wolf wrote Electric
&gt; Kool-aid Acid Test about. Ken Kesey also wrote One Flew Over The Kuckoos
&gt; nest) Well, at one time in my life, Ken Kesey was kinda a hero to me. So
&gt; I was in a bookstore in Farmville, Va., telling this story, and the lady
&gt; who owned the bookstore, Marcia, came up and said, &quot;I'm sorry, but I
&gt; couldn't help but over hear your story. I used to live in Northern
&gt; California in the 60's, and I was also a big fan of Ken Kesey. I have an
&gt; old VW in my back lot that I drove from Oregon in the early 70's and
&gt; I've always wanted to restore, but never got around to it.&quot; I said,
&gt; &quot;Wow, well I'm kinda broke right now.&quot; Marcia said, &quot;I have a real
&gt; strong feeling about this, and you are supposed to go to Oregon in this
&gt; Volkswagon, this van is meant to be for you. I'll make a deal (she went
&gt; and got a Ken Kesey book off the shelf and said) I'll let you take her
&gt; on your word that you'll pay me $600 when you have the money on the
&gt; condition that you get Ken to autograph this book for me.&quot; That is how I
&gt; got her! I mailed her $500, and she said don't worry about the rest.
&gt;         Once we broke down in Waco Texas for three days and the mechanic her
&gt; rebuilt her was legally blind. His son built the engine while listening
&gt; to the old man instruct him. I have a billion stories, she tored the
&gt; country with Jerry and The Grateful Dead also. Sometime I'll tell you
&gt; about when we blew the engine outside of Quartzite.
&gt;         We have a wealth of memorabilia, as we have collected everything from
&gt; those days. To what extent, and to how much detail we can put towards
&gt; getting it together depends basically on my time, and available funds.
&gt; This is why I had to let her go. I knew that I didn't have the time or
&gt; money to tinker anymore with her. If I kept her, she would just continue
&gt; to degrade, but if I let her go, maybe she could get restored. This was
&gt; always my dream for her. One day I went to the woods and said a prayer
&gt; and asked Creator what I should do with her. The next day, I went
&gt; outside, and both of her tires were slashed. People wrote me from all
&gt; over the country trying to persuade me to keep her, but the decision had
&gt; been made.
&gt;         This is a side note. We are all still very active performers as a
&gt; group. We are serious musicians and even more serious clowns. A friend
&gt; of mine, named Patch Adams is a M.D. He is also a clown. For 30 years,
&gt; he has never charged a patient. He says that medicine should be a
&gt; servive, not a business. He is also very socially and politically
&gt; outspoken. This Dec. 25th, a movie about Patch's life will be released
&gt; by Universal starring Robin Williams. We are preparing for major
&gt; exposure, so it is good that we have this time, and that you are fixing
&gt; Bessie up so quickly. I think there is much room for all of us to get a
&gt; really good message to the world, and have lots of fun doing it, and
&gt; make a little money in the process so that we can continue to make our
&gt; dreams come true, and help others to do the same. Thankyou for helping
&gt; make ours and Bessies dream come true, our ultimate dream is    HEALING,
&gt; for the environment, Mother Earth, the animals and all people. No more
&gt; bullshit, we've all been through enough, lets make a big celebration. I
&gt; also have friends in New Orleans, and we have been talking about world
&gt; Mardi Gras Carnival Ball. So we've been at it for many years, and we
&gt; have been weathered, but the dream is still very alive, and we have'nt
&gt; even begun!
&gt; Many Blessings,
&gt; Jacob
