RE:     Copy of: F.S. Alloy wheels for Van/bus PICTURES!!

Hey all, Listmember Sami Dakhlia was kind enough ( thanks Sami ! ) to scan these
pics I sent him of the wheels I'm selling.  Once again, they are 15&quot; and fit all
Vanagons and buses down to '71.  I also have a set of the &quot;Carat&quot; 14&quot; alloy
wheels for sale and all lugs and caps. These too, will fit all VW vans / buses
down to '71.

Pics are at:

hit auto images download if they don't show up right away.
