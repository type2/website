Ah - makes sense.  I hope that's all it is.

&gt; First, be sure that adjustment is needed.  put the bus on a level surface,

&gt; sill.

Will do.  I've long been aware of the no-horizon rearview (although I 
*think* my 68 westy had a longer mirror arm and less of a problem), but 
comparing this bus to others I see around town, it's really low.

Thanks for the tips (also thanks to Brian).  Several people have 
confirmed that inner and outer ends must be rotated to get the kind of 
adjustment needed.
