Subject: Towing Advice?

Hi,

Just bought a '68 camper and need to have it towed home (approx 45 mi one
way) so we'll be doing the old UHaul and trailer bit I guess unless anyone
has a better/cheaper/safer idea?

The question I have is whether to tow with the back wheels up (recommended
for beetles) or do the front wheels up?

Be merciful to the newbie,
Jen :-)
