Subject: CDI installed... almost works!

I spent today installing the CDI system that I bought from ACN.  Most 
of the day was spent rerouting all of the related wiring to a set of 
terminal blocks mounted on the firewall (I will post photos once I've 
written up the text to go with them).

I verified the engine runs OK with the rerouted wiring in the stock 
configuration (no CDI) with the new Compufire high-output coil I got as 
part of the setup.

Removed the &quot;stock configuration&quot; jumpers from the terminal blocks, and 
wired up the Hyfire to the terminal blocks (see attached wiring 
description and terminal block diagram).  Hyfire is grounded on the 
body, and has a 14 ga. power lead running from the starting battery.  
Set the Hyfire configuration switches to &quot;4 cylinder mode&quot; (1=on, 
2=off).

Still have stock rotor, wires, and plugs (I'm putting the pieces in one 
at a time and verifying proper operation at each step).

Had my wife turn the key, Hyfire blinks its LED as it finishes its 
self-test.  So, I have her crank it over.  Engine fails to catch and 
run.

Pulled coil wire from distributor, and held about 1/2'' away from coil 
clamp bolt, had my wife crank it over.  Verified I have spark (WOAH BOY 
do I ever have spark).

So, I think the problem is that the FI is not triggering properly.  I 
do have the Mallory tach adapter installed.  The tach adapter connects 
to switched +12v and the white &quot;from points&quot; wire on the Hyfire (the 
latter was determined as the correct connection by reading Mallory's 
on-line knowledge base; the instructions included with the tach adapter 
are for the Hyfire 4, not the Hyfire 6).

My FI trigger is connected to the yellow &quot;to tach&quot; wire on the Hyfire 
(along with my VDO tach).  I ran out of daylight, so I haven't hooked 
up a test light yet to see if the tach output from the Hyfire is 
working OK.  The manual says it produces a square wave, +12v, 20% duty 
cycle.

Has anyone else on the list hooked up a Hyfire with a stock FI system?  
If so, could you please tell me how you handled the FI trigger wire?  
Specifically, did you connect it to the Hyfire's white &quot;points&quot; wire or 
the yellow &quot;tach&quot; wire?  Did you use the tach adapter?  If so, what 
Hyfire wire did you connect it to?  Did you have to use the diode 
included with the adapter?

I am planning on documenting the whole thing so hopefully no one else 
will have to ask these questions :-)

Thanks!
