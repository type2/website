Subject: Re: [T2] Brittle wire in engine bay

&gt; I have quite a few brittle wires in my engine bay

You sure you're not talking about an old Volvo? ;-)

I've had good luck over the years with high quality electrical tape
wrapped around the wires as well as various plastic wire loom
products.

In the following picture you can see the stock style sheathing as well
as the ribbed wire loom. For the wire loom I use either electrical
tape or zip ties at the ends and every so often along the length to
keep it closed and snug. Heat shrink tubing will also work if the loom
is full with wires.
