Subject: Re: replacing nuts

I gave up trying to find copper nuts in metric size - I lost one out of my
set of four - I had to use a stainless one as a replacement -I'd like to
know where you get the copper ones from!

There are copper nuts available that wouldn't rust - those would be my
first choice.  Whatever type you use, put lots of anti-sieze on the studs
before you install them and don't overtighten.  If you want to be sure you
don't have problems in the future, remove the nuts every year, clean
everything and reapply the anti-sieze.
