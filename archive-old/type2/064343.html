Subject: successful seat re-cushioning

Hey all,
My front seat cushions finally arrived from WCM today, being gray foam
they cost $13 each, probably could have done better somewhere else.
Took the driver's seat out (after I figured out that catch -- duh, why
won't this come out??) and observed the situation.  I had ordered from
WCM the hog rings and hog ring pliers but observing the seat condition
it was obvious that the lower cushions don't use hog rings.  DOH!  To
get to these buggers (I'm talking about a '78 bus) you have to unscrew
the seat rails from teh seat bottom, 4 allen head screws.  Then you have
to be careful because things want to fly apart, but you basically just
remove the lower cusion from the back/frame.  VW apparently changed
their method of seath cover attachment on these late buses.  There are
no hog rings on the lower cushion.  Instead, there is a channel that
runs around the outside of the lower seat frame (on the bottom).  The
vinyl has a stiff cardboard (or something similar) ridge sewn on the
lower edge all the way around and all this does is fit in the channel.
Once I figured this out, I used a screwdriver to pry out a starting
point and the rest just pulled out.  

Then you just pull the cover up off the springs, remove the old crusty
horsehair and foam.  Installing the new isn't quite as easy, but with a
LOT of fiddling around and cursing you can get it all in there.  It took
me a while but I found a good technique eventually.  Then you push the
cardboard stuff back into the channel, reassemble the seat.

Take this opportunity to clean all the crap out from under the seat in
the car and really really really lube up that seat track.  I put a LOT
of grease in there.  I also greased up the seat rails and the handle
mechanism (neat how that works) and then put the seat back in.  Make
sure it's in the track right.  It also helps to take off the headrest to
do this.  BTW, I was expecting the seat to be rather heavy but it's
really really light.  I had no trouble lifting it and installing it
myself.  

I just did the driver's seat as it's not technically hard but it takes a
long time.  Plus, the passenger seat is pretty stuck in its track, so I
need a helper to hold the handle while I kick it from behind :) .

Whew!

PS - I also got a new radio antenna after losing my old one somewhere in
New Jersey or Delaware (I think) and installed it.  It's kind of in a
crappy place but it can be done pretty easily once you figure out how to
orient your arm in there.  It's easiest if you remove that kick panel
and do the job from down there.
