&gt;After replacing the original engine of my bay-window with a 1641cc 
unleaded,
&gt;I am interested to know what kind of top speed in mph I should expect 
out of
&gt;her once the engine has been run in. At the mo' I'm not taking her over
&gt;50mph.
&gt;Also, will the addition of a set of better carbs gret me any more 
power, if
&gt;so how much....and is it worth it ?
&gt;With thanks and greetings to y'all
&gt;Garp

  I don't think that a new engine will gain you any more top speed. I 
don't think a bus will go much over 70mph with an upright engine, unless 
its a 2100cc type and you have a pact with the devil. I don't feel same 
in my bus at speeds over 70mph and will never go over it. I do think 
that you may gain some in that you will be able to get there in less 
time or with less effort. The bus was not ment to go fast, if you want 
to go fast in a VW, try a type 1 or 3. They have a lot less frontal area 
and less mass. 
  I will guess that because you used &quot;mph&quot; that you are in the U.S. so 
your bus would likely be a 68-71. 68-70 have drum brakes all the way 
around and this is a factor to keep in mind. It takes a lot to stop a 
bus doing 60mph and even more at 70mph or 80mph.
  If yours is a Westy or camper with a top on it then the top speed may 
only be 65-70mph even with a bigger engine that the one you have. 41cc's 
is not that big of a change to expect a big HP increase. I would think 
that around town would be most noticeable.
  I in no way want to rain on your parade. I think this engine will do 
you very good. Just don't be disapointed when the top speed is the same 
as it was with a stock 1600cc mill.
  Enjoy life a little slower, you see things that you did not know were 
there before, and you arive alive.
   And have a safe and happy New Year!

BTW let me know if I am way off on this, It is just my opinon. See 
prevous thread titled tuning a type 2 driver for more on this type of 
mentality.
