Subject: Re: [T2] Mounting Spare tire
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Might not be such a good idea. Even with a lift gate strut to carry the extra
weight when opened, the weight of the spare would be added to the hinges
when closed. The hatch seals against the body but is always supported by
the hinges and the extra weight (exacerbated by bumps), might pull the en-
tire hatch downwards. It's only four bolts and captive nuts holding it on...
