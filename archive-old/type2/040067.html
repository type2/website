Subject: Ignition Switch Installation, 77 Westy

I'm new to Type 2 (familiar with Type 1's though) and just bought a 77 Westy. 
It needs an ignition switch. I have the Haynes manual (Bentley is on the 
way), and I have gotten pretty far with removing the steering wheel, turn and 
wiper switches, and taking out the two phillips head screws that hold the 
lower housing in place. Now what? When I try to pull up on the whole steering 
lock, it won't come. Answers in non-tech language appreciated--I'm just 
learning. I'm sure I'l have a few (er, maybe more than a few) more questions 
as I get going!
