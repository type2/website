That is such a good idea, though.  I love that I could use my heater levers
for something (my friends refer to them as &quot;flap settings&quot; like on an old
airplane).  And I'm sure there's a way to set up the brake in that system.
Something that either disconnects the cable from the pedal temporarily, or
that actually pulls or pushes the pedal back up with another apparatus.  Cool
stuff.  I love it.
