Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus with 83 subaru engine so far so good!

Greg - That is a 2.2 and later issue. His is the 1.8.
When I did my conversion, the best &quot;advice&quot; I could
get was to take a sledge hammer to the gas tank and
leave the firewall out! (This is for throttle body
clearance) Naturally I did not do that. I found that
the aircraft conversion folks have come up with
different intake manifolds and alternator brackets,
but even the best of them was failing at that time. I
turned the intake manifold around 180 degrees and put
the bolts back in... fits either way! I ground off the
part of the AC compressor / alternator bracket that
the compressor attaches to and flipped the alternator
upside down. That gave room for the throttle body but
not for the air bypass valve. The ABP valve is for
fast idle during warmup and for increasing idle speed
during AC use. I did not need it. Lotsa ways to do a
fast idle. Oops - Late for work! -BaH

 Hi Richard,
 
 Any issues with the fit of the engine to the fuel
 tank? I have heard  
 that can be an issue with baywindow subie
 conversions.
 
 
 Happy Trails,
