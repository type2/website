Subject: Re: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

The 50/50 sliding windows were only
found on the late transporters (78&amp;79??). They
let in a lot of air when driving (I swapped my
jalousies for these) but you will have to make 
your own screens 

I second Hotdog's comments.  These are great
windows, especially for hot Arizona summers.  But
I still don't think they'll fit in the passenger
or driver's window.  :)
