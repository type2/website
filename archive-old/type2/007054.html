Subject: Voltage Regulator or Isolator

Hey ya'll,
I'm in need of some help.  Last week I noticed that my generator light would 
come on when I turned off the ignition.  I did not recognize it's 
significance at the time.  So I ran it until the gen. stayed on with the 
ignition on and off.  Obviously I ran the battery down and ran the risk of 
ruining the alternator.  I was told, by a list member, that I would probably 
need to replace the voltage regulator and alternator.  Well, I have replaced 
the regulator and the light continues to come on when the ignition is off.  
It is dimmer but it remains.  What's the deal?  Is it possible that the 
isolator is malfunctioning?  What are the signs of a malfunctioning isolator?
Any advice would be appreciated?
