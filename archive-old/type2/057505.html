Subject: Re: PDSIT Enrichment/Lean Resistor Q

Hi Brad (and List),

Brad in Oregon ans his '72 Camper - Gus posted a bunch 'o carb
questions...

Oy, you've got a task there, dontcha? ;-)  I had some of the same
questions when I was figuring out the systems on *my* bus, so I think
the answers might be of interest to others besides yourself; hence I'm
posting this to the List.

1) enrichment/lean resistor:  This widget causes the idle mixture to be
slightly richer until it gets heated up.  As the resistor heats, a metal
strip deflects, and *opens* the little hole, thereby leaning the mixture
a bit.  Thus I'd vote for leaving that one unplugged, _or_ plugging it
and adjusting the idle mixture accordingly.

2) Idle cut-off valve:  This *must* be plugged, or you'll never get the
idle mixture adjusted at all (HUGE air leak!)  The cut-off solenoid is
nice to have, as it keeps the motor from running on after you turn the
key off, but it isn't strictly necessary.

3) The two other idle cut-off valves: As above, it's nice to have these
functional (and for the same reasons), but again they aren't really
required.  Replacement metering jets are available for a couple bucks,
that will get rid of the non-functioning solenoids.

4) Is there supposed to be something connected to the tall air inlet on
the top of the carb?: Yes, this is where the air for the idle mixture
comes from.  There should be a hose from the inlet to the air filter
housing.  It's important -- you don't want to be sucking dust and bugs
into your nice new carbs and engine!

...could these open holes where there are missing parts be part of the
problem?

Very likely!  These carbs are extremely sensitive to air &amp; vacuum
leaks.  You will never get them dialed in without going to some lengths
to seal 'em up proper.  Take the time and do it right, or risk a great
deal of frustration (and possible damage to your motor) down the road.

HTH, and good luck...
