 Ouch. Seems to me that if you can't do the work yourself (no garage: rent
a lockup?) then you need to find someone you can both trust and afford. It
looks like your current engine isn't a viable proposition in its current
state so unless you get it sorted properly you arn't going to get much joy
from it.
 I can't recommend papering over the cracks- the only point in just getting
the duff ring sorted would be to buy you time to get a reliable engine- if
the current one can be made reliable then that may be the best way to go,
but if it's fundamentally flawed then there's no point throwing the 
proverbial good money after bad.
 It sounds like the mechanic will stand behind his work (otherwise he'd
probably be happy to re-use the heads): his recommendation may be 
conservative but seems credible.

 Sooner or later you're going to have to spend the money to get a 
reliable engine. If you don't want to do it now then you can probably
put off the day by patching your current one or buying a used runner
but it does seem that making your current engine reliable will not
be cheap.

 The only alternative I can see is to buy an MOT failed parts bus with
a decent engine (maybe £500?) and swap it in. If you can find somewhere
to store the shell and get lucky then this might get you out of your
current predicament and you could then get your duff engine put right
at a more convenient time.

 Might be worth having a trawl through the classifieds?

Cheers,
