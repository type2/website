Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Carb Flooding

I'm not really a carb guru, but I do know a little bit about them.  If I 
remember correctly, the float controls how much fuel is allowed into the 
carb.  It also is responsible to turn off the fuel when the float bowl 
is full.  If the float is not working properly, it will keep allowing 
fuel to flow into the carb and then out through the jets and into the 
engine.

I have never seen a vw carb but I'd venture to guess that it has a 
float.  If so, I would check to see that it's operating correctly and is 
shutting off the fuel properly.

&gt; Your problems sound similar to mine but not as bad. I was hoping there was
&gt; somebody out there that knew a cure for this. I will probably just end up
&gt; throwing a new carb at the problem as that seems to fix it for a few months.
&gt; And my new engine is fully balanced so maybe the wear and tear on the carb
&gt; will be less and hopefully last longer.
