Subject: FS: '72 Riviera Camper (w/engine hatch) , Engine, Parts, Tools, etc. Memphis, TN

Hi,

I'm selling my bus and all associated bus parts, tools, etc. You may 
remember me from the list off and on for years. Bottom line, I now live in 
an apartment and need the cash. Has to do with the letter D. I'm paying 
storage (and have been for months) to keep my bus and it makes no sense 
economically.

Here's a short list of what I have that I'd like to sell. Please note that I 
really don't want to do shipping on the larger items, but if you'll pay the 
cost up front, I'll try to accomodate you.

'72 Riviera Bus. Blue. Some Rust spots, but VERY solid, with solid rockers. 
AVP built to my specs...I'm a little weird: 75 case built as an 1800 
hydraulic, with a fuel pump installed, but using fuel injection (the fuel 
pump was part of my emergency response plan, with a spare carb and risers 
sitting in the bus). The bus runs great and has (I'm sure) less than 10,000 
miles on the AVP. I haven't been driving it in some time, but I do crank it 
every few weeks. It's in dry storage right now. I'm asking $2000, but I'll 
negotiate for a quick sale. Trust me, it's well worth that--actually, I 
estimate it's worth $3500 in a normal market, but I'm anxious to sell. I 
have a bunch of photos and I'll probably get some more this afternoon, but 
it'll probably be tomorrow before I can post them. This bus has an engine 
hatch from a '74 welded in, so there's good overhead access to the engine. 
Pop top's in good condition. Missing fridge, but I might be able to get one 
from my ex (I never got it from the house and we've finalized papers, so 
legally it's hers). If I can't get it from her, I'm sure she'd sell it to 
you cheap--along with anything else of mine remaining. ;) Bus has good 
tires, good tranny, etc. Great driver bus! You'll eventually want to replace 
the windshield and seals and it'll need some pinhole repair up there and 
around a couple windows. This bus will get you around while you work on it 
though. I seem to recall that I wanted to revisit the brakes on the bus 
before I took a long trip, but I don't recall specifically why. At any rate, 
I'll look at them before you go anywhere in the bus and I can (or we can 
together) go through a thorough check/service on it.

Engine 2.0 liter. $300. Preference to someone who wants to pick it up...the 
sooner the better. I'm selling this at a huge loss, in order to sell it 
fast. Ran great when pulled, but it had spit an oil galley plug and I fixed 
it with JB Weld and a dime. The fix took and I ran it for over 1000 miles 
like this, but I didn't trust the fix...even though people swear they have 
run engines that had the block fixed with JBWeld...so I bought an AVP and 
put this engine in storage. You can run as is, or you can split it and 
replace the oil galley plugs, which is what I'd recommend. You'll come out 
way ahead, since I painstakingly went over every inch of this engine and 
replaced anything that needed replacing! IT has a new cam, reground crank, 
new heads, etc, etc, I did swipe one or two lifters when the ones in my AVP 
started tapping. The engine is probably worth about $550, considering what 
you need to do to it to make it perfect. This would be a GREAT project 
engine for someone.

I have a HEAVY DUTY engine stand that I'll sell for $20. It's a standing 
model. You have to come get it.

I've got a mig welder that I put in the paper for $350 and nobody 
called--correction; a guy called as I was typing this. Hmmmm. It's a 110 
volt and it comes with a tank and all of my welding supplies. I'll sell it 
for whatever I can get for it, with preference to someone picking it up. 
Dude's gonna come look at it; I'll let you know.

I've got a pretty good cache of spare parts that I'll post about later, 
after I get a chance to do an inventory. I got a couple splitty bumpers at 
my ex's house that she'd probably sell you for toting fees. ;-)

Thanks! Joe
