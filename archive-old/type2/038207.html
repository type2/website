hi all,

Just a thought.... this thing could go on forvever.  Do we have a ending
point and or final resting place picked. I have a feeling if there was
some goal to meet people would be more interested, but as it stands now i
have no idea where the thing is going or why... i cant see participating
in something that is doomed to peter out and end up in someones garage
until it eventually gets thrown away..

take care,

Steve
