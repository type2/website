&gt;welding. The carbon monoxide being heavier than air will completly
&gt;displace any OX in the tank -No OX- NO FIRE - This is foolproof .I have
&gt;used it many times on auto and bike tanks.

Or if you have the balls (BUT I IN NO MATTER AM SAYING THIS IS A GOOD OR
EVEN PRACTICAL IDEA) you could leave it completely full of gasoline.  Funny
thing this, I've seen welders, quite commonly on real gasoline storage tanks
weld patches over even dripping or running cracks with oxyacetylene.  Common
practice I take it.  You've got to be incredibly sure you are welding below
the fluid level but if you are there is apparently no risk of explosion.  If
there is actually a running leak, the gasoline running out will be igniting
rolling off in streams or balls of flame but the integrity of what's inside
is not jeaporadized.  I note this as a mere novelty, not as a practice
anyone sane and not of the profession would undertake.  Principle is the
same as the CO (a real neat idea I think, I've used water before but it is a
pain to ever let contact a tank without running down some machinist oil) as
long as there is no air, no risk of ignition inside the tank and as long as
the level is above the weld the gas flows out.
