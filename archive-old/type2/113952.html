&gt;Has anyone ever attempted converting a Bubble/High top back to a hard top? If so, what were some of the challenges you faced? If not, what challenges might you expect.

Most bubbletops have the complete roof cut out, so you would be faced with welding in a whole new roof, pretty much everything inside the rain gutters (except possibly for what's above the cab).

Do you have to make it a hardtop?  You could make one heck of a ragtop out of it.
