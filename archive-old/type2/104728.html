Subject: Re: [T2] Some more on &quot;measuring deck height&quot;

Tom,

Errr...let's talk...Haven't thought about concave pistons in awhile, so
is the deck height really measured at the center of the piston or on the 
edges???

All of the stuff I have ever seen on deck height has been about the amount 
of room to leave between the highest part of the piston and the head.  You 
dished pistons are there to reduce the Compression Ratio...right?

So to me, deck height would still be set using the edge of the pistons
rather than the center....hmmmm...when you say dished on the pistons, I 
assumed concave rather than domed.  If domed, then you are correct, all
bets off on my end!

Dial calipers would probably give you a fairly good reading as described 
in another post.  Cheap chinese like this...

would probably be close enough....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Unfortunately I have the style of dial gauge that has the movable rod
&gt; sticking out the back of the gauge so I can't try to duplicate your method.
&gt; Too, the Vanagon engines have pistons with wide dishes in the middle of the
&gt; piston so any method of measuring deck height always has you working on the
&gt; edges of the pistons, not near the middle.
