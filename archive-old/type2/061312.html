Subject: Re:fuel sender

I just read the digest &amp; was appaled at this sort of post.

&gt;This is a prime example of a &quot;slash and burn&quot; repair job. Someone's
fuel
guage isn't working well and it annoys them.
Instead of buying a fuel sender and having it ready, meanwhile keeping
track of your mileage and fill-ups on a notepad
until you're ready to pull the motor for other reasons, then take that
opportunity to R&amp;R the fuel sender and  tank when
 the motor is out, someone got the idea to saw a hole in the floor ofthe
bus above the fuel tank area and replace the sender
that way. Who cares about the structural integrity of the van, that fact
that the road and motor sounds and fumes will begin
&gt;to inevitable pollute the bus through this hole.
------------------------------------------------------
I feal that opening a mouth without thinking of a polite sudgestion,
seriously calls into question the structural integrity of said posters
brain.

 As it turns out my van has already had this mod made, also a
modification kit was availible FROM VW for just this repair &amp; if
Structural integrity is a sticking point, then next time a bit of rust
needs welding write it down on a pad instead! Cutting &amp; welding the
simplist of body panels causes many other affects of stress, fatigue
etc...

Sorry to rant but that kind of un-constructive post puts my dander
UP!!!
