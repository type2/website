hey all
the 63 will be in my garage on sunday! yay!!!
well..anyways.. here is my problemo..and it may be an engine
problem..thats why I posted to the vintage list too..and I now have 2.5
vintage buses....ones cut apart :( but keep in mind...the 68's and 69's
are vintage ...right? 30 years or older..
anyways...
when I start up my engine on a warm day...it runs just fine... and
usually doesn't kill while idling... but on a cold day...I start it
up..and it will kill just after I start it...sometimes when I turn on my
lights or blinkers... and I have to restart it and the only way it will
keep running is if I hold in my push button (my ignition is messed
up..hehe) that goes from the battery to the coil directly... so is this
an ignition switch problem? should I just swap it out?  what is the PITA
rating on such a job?
thanks all...but is there anything else to check?


just read about backfiring through the intake manifold...sounds nasty!
anyone ever have that happen to them?

anyone need any late bay bumpers? I've got a set...in great shape..

later guys
