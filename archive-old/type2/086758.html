Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

Many years ago I heard a story that VW build a chase/support vehicle
for some baja/Paris Dakar Race from a bus.  The resulting off vehicle was
so good that it put many vehciles in the class it was chasing to shame.  I
 thinks the mods included 4 wheel drive, bottom armor, and a really
modified VW motor.

Any else hear of this or better yet have pics.
