Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat-Cosmoline?

Checked a search; Cosoline is: &quot;A combination of grease, shellac and
beeswax with copper sulfate added as a corrosion inhibitor. It is
initially heated and thinned with alcohol during the mixing state, then
is allowed to cool and set up.&quot;  Most links deal with removing this
tough coating after it has dried; many use paint thinner like solvents
or just paint over it!  Apparently it does not form a peeling layer like
dried undercoating. The mechanic I mentioned fills the body cavities of
the busses he restores with Cosmoline.  Rick Taylor wrote:
 
&gt; I haven't had to clean any of that stuff off in years!!  That was what all
&gt; the military stuff had all over it.  When shipping overseas, everything was
&gt; coated in cosmoline.  It was kind of waxy, but a little greasy too.
