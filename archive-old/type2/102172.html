&gt;The moving magnetic parts of the engine are the barrels, crankshaft,

&gt;If there is damage, it is already done, so there is little harm in running
&gt;the engine further.


Sorry, George, but this is a rare case where I must disagree with you. A 
broken crank has less value than a rebuildable crank. At this point, some 
of those parts might be reusable. If you push this engine further, you can 
break the case with a big cachunk. Even if the wear says no core charge 
value already, why add the cost of a final tow to the costs? If it still 
runs, drive it to be fixed, stored or disposed of and save the tow charge 
and the costs of such inconvienience.
