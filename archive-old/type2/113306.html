Subject: Re: [T2] shifting is stressing me out man ...

&lt;&lt;  At a full stop ie. stop sign or just starting the bus, I have 
&gt; INCREDIBLE difficulty shifting into first.  It seems that I always get 
&gt; third or something.  I have to push down into the floor and really 
&gt; grind it to get first.  Sometimes shifting into reverse, then trying 
&gt; first works.  Getting to a stop sign from thrid, then stopping, then 
&gt; going to neutral then first, is almost impossible.

My first guess would be clutch (either adjustment or replacement).
After you sort that out, try driving like this (after all, you've got a
25+ year old trans, give it a break)...When upshifting, go to neutral
and let the clutch up, then depress it and shift to the next gear.
Downshifting, go to neutral, clutch up and blip the throttle to increase
the RPM's, then clutch in and shift into the next lower gear...Get this
technique down and you'll eventually find you can go up and down the
gears without the clutch IF you hafta...I've driven cars with &quot;crash-boxes&quot;
with this technique, but it's still a good way to help keep the transmission
off the rebuilder's bench... ;-)
