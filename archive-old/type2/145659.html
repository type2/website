Subject: Re: Need a VW shop near Gardena, CA

Heather:

This may be out of date info, but I got a transmission rebuilt about 10
years ago at Serrano's in Torrance, and was happy with them - I'm not
sure what other services they provide nowadays (ie whether or not
they'd look over the Vanagon), but it might be worth calling them at
least, since they're pretty close to Gardena.

I found the following discussion on the Samba, which basically says
they've recently moved, but doesn't give the new address - however, I'm
guessing the phone number's still the same:

good luck
