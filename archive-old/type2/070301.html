Subject: Dead Stickers: Probable Cause?

I live in Indiana &amp; I have a cousin (who shall remain nameless- if not
blameless) who is a state trooper. He helped with security at the last
Grateful Dead show at Deer Creek (where the ticketless fans tried to break
into the concert area). The first time I saw him right after that, I showed
him a sticker with a yellow GD bear surrounded by red roses. &quot;What does this
mean to you?&quot; I asked. &quot;Stop the vehicle &amp; search for drugs!&quot; was his
reply. I don't know if that is an &quot;official&quot; policy of the ISP- but, I think
you get the picture. I'm not actually a &quot;deadhead&quot;- never made it to one of
their shows. But I do like some of their music &amp; my wife loves the stickers
with the bears- mainly because she loves teddy bears. It's too bad that I
have to be afraid to display a bear sticker on my camper because of police
attitudes....

Oh well. Enuff of my ranting &amp; raving for now.
