When I wired my gauges I used an insulated three wire bundle (white,black,
and green) which is used for extension cords,etc. I was able to run three
wires from the front to the back in the same time it takes to run one. I
grounded my gauges to the body in front, got the hot wire from the fuse box,
and used each of the three wires for the gauge sensor wire. I think the wire
I used was 14 ga.. I have not had any trouble in 2 1/2 years. TBear
