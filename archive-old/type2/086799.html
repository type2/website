&gt; Greetings Bus list members: I would like to get advise on a very subjective question:
&gt; 
&gt; I now own a 67 21 DLX, a 70 Ghia, 73 SB and a 82 Rabbit Conv. A good friend wants to trade my 70 Ghia for his 1970 Crew Cab (double cab).  The ghia is all new, paint, motor, etc. The 70 Crew cab is all original, paint, motor, etc. The body is cherry, no dents, no rust (desert T2), motor runs strong.....just everything is 1970, its a true cream puff. Should I? Any thoughts on the 1970 crew model? How are parts availability for this model?
&gt; 
&gt; What to do? 
&gt; 
&gt; Hart
