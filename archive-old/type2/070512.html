Subject: '79 Cal bus - EGR filter?
To: type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com (IPM Return Requested)
Message-Id: &lt;&quot;981013141118Z.WT24872.  3*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

Do the '79 California busses NOT have an EGR filter and valve?
I don't see one on my '79, and it does not look like one was ever
there. Bentley talks about an EGR for a '79 bus, but I am wondering
if that only means the Federal model. Does the O2 sensor on the
'79 Cal bus somehow replace the EGR filter and valve?
