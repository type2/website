Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel

Ok I need to buy a gauge to check the endplay of my crankshaft. I am
borrowing a car to get it so:

What is it called? I am going to a FLAPS and I could go to Sears. Anything
special I need to know?

Also with the flywheel bolted on and the cooling fan on the hub I can't seem
to get either to move back and forth at all! Is this maybe because I have
too many shims or shims that are too thick?

Thanks for any support! I haven't driven in 3 weeks now and am desperate to
get this engine in again!

&gt; &gt; I am trying to install the flywheel on my new rebuilt AVP engine. But I
am
&gt; &gt; having some trouble.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My engine turns fine with the flywheel off. Once I put the flywheel on,
&gt; &gt; lining up the pin and lightly tightening the 5 bolts, the engine won't
turn
&gt; &gt; anymore. Its as if the flywheel is fouling the case. I have not torqued
the
&gt; &gt; bolts to 80ft lbs yet.
&gt;
&gt; you need to set your endplay....  it will totally screw up your brand new
&gt; engine if you don't...job 17.5 pg 65/66 in the Engine Clutch chapter of
&gt; Bentley explains how to do this better than I ever could

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought maybe I needes some shims. After researching the archives I
see
&gt; &gt; that there should be some shims for crankshaft endplay, and I am not
sure
&gt; &gt; what they look like, but on my AVP engine the main seal was already
&gt; &gt; installed and there seem to be some &quot;rings&quot; there with an o-ring over
them.
&gt; &gt; I assume these are the shims and that AVP has already taken care of
this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why won't my engine turn with the flywheel on? Am I missing some shims
or
&gt; &gt; something. I have been reading my Bentley but am at a loss.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am reusing the flywheel, the correct 210mm for my 72 Westy and
although I
&gt; &gt; haven't gotten that far a new 210 Sachs clutch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!!
