Subject: Re: Dellorto carbs in the winter

I have a single dual throat Dellorto DRLA on my 1600 cc bus engine which has
been bored out to 1700 cc.  It has the standard exhaust gas preheat tube
running under the intake manifold and I have an electric fuel pump.  The
thing is hard to start in the winter and once started takes 10 minutes when
it is really cold outside to idle correctly, without having to blip the
throttle every several seconds.  Any of you have any ideas on how to improve
the situation?  Is it possible to install a choke on these carbs?  Also, the
mileage is lousy, 17 mpg, worse than my Porsche.  Could the main jets be too
large?  Appreciate any insight on this.  Mike H
