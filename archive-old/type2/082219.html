The only way to repair a polyethylene, or polypropylene, plastic is to
hot air weld it----
And it is not an inexpensive proposition--you'd be better off buying a
new tank, for what the welding set-up will cost .

Later,

reservoir 
Is it not polyethylene? There is a good reason many glue tubes and
bottle are polyethylene . . . nothing sticks well to it. 
The only way to properly repair polyethylene is to weld it but you need
the right tools, technique, and experience to do that. A hot gas jet is
used rather than an electrode of any sort so forget the soldering iron. 
You could encapsulate it in a layer of fiberglass and polyester resin.
