Subject: Camping in PA, at last!

Hi Volks,

After a frustrating year of unexpected 
repair projects, my '73 Westy has finally
has finally taken the family camping in '98.

1)  About camping in PA:
FYI, the Pennsylvania state parks
will finally go to a reservation system 
that will permit advance site reservations
in addition to the current &quot;first-come, 
first-serve&quot; system. This can significantly 
reduce the stress factor of using the PA
state parks and extend the travel range to
reach them. (I always stress that there will
be no sites available on arrival... and with good
reason. - see below)

To begin in September of 1998.
check the web for details or email me.

2) Where we went (and tried to go),
We headed NW out from the Philadelphia
area toward Appalacian Mountains.
We passed on Hickory Run S.P. which is a 
popular destination, because it was expected
to be very crowded that weekend due to some 
local races.

Our chosen destination was Ricket's Glen S.P.
which is famous for its old-stand forest and many
water falls. Unfortunately, we we arrived at 4pm
we found the 120sites FILLED!

Our desperate new plan was to go on to
World's End S.P. on the Loyalsock Creek.
Only ten of the 70 sites were left but one became 
ours and it was great. We hiked, swam in the creek, 
took the kids to the nature talks, and had a wonderful
family experience. 
It turned out great and we highly recommend it to
others.

&gt;Anyone heading there is welcome to drop me a line
if you want our notes on the choice camp sites.

3) Special thanks to:
 - Ron Salmon &amp; the Bus Depot gang 
 - Randy Cohen for his mech support and encouragement.


Enjoy the ride,

Mike Dulany
Chalfont, PA
