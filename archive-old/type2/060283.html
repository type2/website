Brian,

AH!  In that case we have a solution!  Rather than lower the front, raise
the back.  If you have the Bentley Manual, there is a procedure in it for
re-adjusting the rear spring plates that will have you sitting pretty in
no time!  If you don't have it, see the following articles in the
archives:

Then do a general search at:

I searched on spring plate, but you may have different keywords that give
other results. (&quot;axle beam&quot; will show you a list of posts on why not to
drop the front, unless you are willing to pop for the offset axle steering
knuckles)

The beauty of the list is that there are very few problems that someone
has not had :-)
