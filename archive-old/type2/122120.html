Subject: broken down update.

I pulled the fuel filter and blew through it and all. Reinstalled it. Put 
the gas back in. tried to start it. Cranked and cranked, but never idled. 
Tried turning the distributer some. It wouldn't idle so I could use the 
timing gun, so I just did it by feel. Messed around with it for a while, but 
didn't help.
I checked to make sure there was spark. I can hear the fuel pump going and I 
know that the fuel is getting at least as far as it. Did visual inspection 
of distributor. Visual check for vacuum leaks. I know I have a small one 
where a little rubber elbow is cracked, but it has always started with it 
before.
Any other ideas.
Maybe point gap?
Thanks a lot,
Kyle
