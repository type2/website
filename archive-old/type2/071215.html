Hi Bill, you wrote:


P.S.S   For you trivia and Vintage Nazis (I'm proudly one of 'em) 

here is what VW's &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; (the VW Factory 

record of changes) has to say about Bus and truck bumpers:



on 29 Aug 1958, as of chassis #384 875, the bumpers were now of 

a &quot;stronger design&quot; (new &quot;slash&quot; type bumper replaces the &quot;ribbed&quot; 

style bumpers) ( USA models got the new bumper blades and bumper 

guards and overrider tubes) and also as of this date the &quot;starting 

handle is no longer supplied&quot; (crank start handle).



Then on the 5th of Jan 1960, as of chassis #554 147 the Bus rear 

bumper is &quot;now a standardized design for all Transporters, 

including Pick-ups&quot;.

so I double check my book , and in the section 8  (body) cannot find that
listing.  In fact I cannot fin early 1960- it skips from 23 nov 59 to 8 mar
60.   In fact, I do not have page A- 50.      Well, sheesh.     
 It's good to hear that.     truck rear slash bumper for about a year and a
half.
.  .. .  . ..  . 


Unfortunately, &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; says absolutely nothing 

about the date and Bus chassis # when they changed from the &quot;slash&quot; 

style to the &quot;pointed&quot; style bumper blades.  So, while there is no

&quot;official&quot; 

VW record of the change, I believe that a lot of us think it happened 

late in the '66 model year and some say it happened early in the 

'67 model year.
 -- -  -- -
I think it is the beginning of the 66 model year, and it seems many people
think the rear pointy blade was started sometime in the 65 model year.
