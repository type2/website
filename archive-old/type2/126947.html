Subject: Re: [T2] CDI

&gt; Its a true CDI, and Im still using the points. I just
&gt; put them in, and Ill wait till they wear out before
&gt; contemplating a replacement. Its mounted were the
&gt; leisure battery will eventually go. Im more interested
&gt; in doing some milage trials with a vaccum advance
&gt; dist. then switching the triggering system at the moment.

you will find the points dont burn like they do with just a coil. there is
less arcing at the points with the cdi. they last a long time.

i mounted mine hanging down from above.
