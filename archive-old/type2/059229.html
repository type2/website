Subject: Tacky parts from RMMW...

My luck with the Rocky Mountain guys has not been good, either.  Last year, I ordered
numerous replacement body panels to redo the rusting wheel wells and under-the-front
parts.  I got the preformed wheel well panels after awhile, but everything else got
cancelled.  If the parts were &quot;in the CONEX, in transit on the ship&quot;, then the ship
must've been following Magellan's route from Europe.  I tried again, twice, to get the
parts.  No joy.  I finally came up against my appointment with my body guy, and delivered
Brunhilda into his competent paws on Saturday.  He called me to come out to the shop last
night, and showed me the two wheel well panels in detail.  One is fine, well-finished, and
stamped out of one continuous piece of metal.  The other is crudely put together from
three separate strips of tin, tack-welded into one piece.  I'm no expert, obviously, but
Mike is, and he described it as having been &quot;fabricated by semi-skilled labor, in
Japanese-occupied Botswana&quot;.  He was incredulous when I told him that I got both from the
same source at the same time.  So, beware the minions of RMMW.
