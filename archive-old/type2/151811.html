Subject: Re: [T2] valve springs on hydraulic lifters

Karl,

Got one right here this morning.

1.7liter     178-205 lbs
1.8-2.0      168-185 lbs

At the loaded length of 29mm

Interesting that a &quot;weak&quot; 1.7liter spring could probably be used in a 
pinch.

and that the hydraulic springs seem to be the same as a 
non-hydraulic 1.8.


Cheers, dave

 Well, this is all well and good, but where have you found the specs for the hydraulic valve springs??
 
 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 36, bottom right corner:
 
 Springs for a dual carb or FI engine should require a load of 76.5 to 84.5 kg (168 to 186 lb.) to compress
 them to a loaded length of 29.0mm ( 1 9/64 in).

 But no specs for the hydraulic springs. If the specs are the same then the part number would be the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone got a LATE bay Without Guesswork?
&gt; 
&gt; Up to the end of 72 Without Guesswork shows the same specs as Bentley
