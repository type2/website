Landon,

Sounds like a retired fuel pump.  As I understand it, it's a royal PIA to
replace.  The typical fix is to acquire and install an aftermarket electric
fuel pump.  Facet is the brand that is usually mentioned.  Available at just
about any FLAPS.

&gt; Current Problem:
&gt; We hung out for a few hours and then were going to go home when I noticed a
&gt; puddle behind the bus.  Under the engine compartment, on the right side
&gt; facing toward the front of the bus is a metal pan/plate that seems to
&gt; protect the underside of the motor.  It is to the right of the main case and
&gt; 'covered' the valve tubes.  Anyway, dirty gasoline was dripping off this
&gt; plate.  I removed the plate and found the problem.  The fuel line goes from
&gt; the tank, to the fuel filter(never seen anyone put it there before, right
&gt; next to the starter) to a little metal something or other (I'm guessing it's
&gt; the fuel pump, but I 'm just guessing).  This thingy has three lines
&gt; connected to it.  The line coming from the fuel filter comes in at the top,
&gt; next to another line that protrudes from the top and a stubby line at the
&gt; bottom that runs into a hole on that metal pan thing and terminates without
&gt; connecting.  It appears to me to be a drain/breather/something hose.
&gt; However, it was out of this hose that fuel was dripping steadily.  I cleaned
&gt; the area a little and had my girlfriend fire up the bus for a second and it
&gt; spurted out this dirty gas.
