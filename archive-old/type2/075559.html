Subject: Re: [T2] Meters

I just love the way you buy a Radio Shack meter for $9.95 and when the
handles on the leads break it cost $6.95 for the replacement leads. Good
Value for sure.
I'm guilty of buying a Chinese meter from Sears for $12.95 but I never
went so far as to say it was any darn good, adequate for checking
continuity and that was all I wanted. Yes I broke the plastic probes
already, JB weld to the rescue.

&gt; Simpson made the original analog models and I think Radio Shack 
&gt; has some too.
&gt; 
&gt; You see more on an analog meter.

&gt; If you really want to see what is happening, get an osilloscope.
