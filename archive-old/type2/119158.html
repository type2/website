Subject: RE: [T2] ignition part #

&gt; 69 Single Cab:
&gt; does anyone know the part number (&amp; maybe who's got 'em) for 
&gt; the mechanical side of the ignition switch?
&gt; 
&gt; i've found the electrical portion, which is: 311905865A. is 
&gt; that correct?


Although not &quot;officially&quot; listed as being for a Bus, I have been told
that the  '68-70 Bug lock cylinder (mechanical side), part # 113905853,
fits the Bus as well. This would somewhat make sense in that it does
mate with the electrical portion that you listed above (which fits both
'68-70 Bug and Bus). Since it's cheap ($8), and returnable if
uninstalled anyway, it's probably worth trying. (If anyone can confirm
from experience that this does fit a bus, I'll add that info to my
website, which will help out other '68-70 owners.)
