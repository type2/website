Subject: Bus Sighting in SE Missouri

Hello all, I had an uncommon occurrence last weekend. As my family and I 
were going thru an intersection by Walmarts in Jackson, Missouri in our 
silver Vanagon, this very nice blue and white splittie passed by going 
west. I honked and waved but they probably didn't see me. Was it anyone 
here?
Tony
