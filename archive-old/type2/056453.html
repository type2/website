Subject: Free middle and rear seats, 76 transporter

I have a middle and rear seat from a '76 transporter to give away. Also,
several trim panels. Brown. All of these are in good condition; few if any
rips.  I don't have room to store them. If you are interested and can pick
them up in the San Diego area, p-mail me.
