&gt; I just did a compression check on 'blue', and she's at 115,120,122, and 130.
&gt; Not too shabby! She still has life in her. My concern is that all the plugs
&gt; were changed about 2000 miles ago, and the have a lot of carbon build-up.
&gt; Could it be running too rich? or are the rings going? I assume the rings may
&gt; be fine because of the compression, but it is 22 years old with no major
&gt; engine work. Plus it only has 125,000 original miles on it. Any ideas?

Your rings are better than some people's new ones. Leave them be. 125,000
miles is not much on a well-maintained engine such as the one in your Bus.
This looks like you're way too rich. Set up your induction system
properly--maybe with the assistance of someone who owns an exhaust gas
analyzer--and you should be fine.
