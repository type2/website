Five years and ~90,000 miles ago I bought and installed some private brand
[made by Gabriel] heavy-duty gas-charged shocks on all 4 corners of our '70
Campmobile.  They replaced a set of Monroe heavy-duty conventional shocks
with helper springs on the rears that the DPO had put on.  The improvement
in ride and handling, especially in crosswinds and/or with heavy loads, was
dramatic.  The gas shocks cost me ~$20.00 each on sale and carry a lifetime
warranty to the original purchaser.  They still perform just fine, with no
perceptible decline in their function.

Without a proper set of reinforced tires running correct inflation
pressures, no shocks at any price will be able to &quot;cure&quot; bus handling
eccentricities in strong crosswinds.

And don't forget the importance of correct wheel alignment, or the 5th shock
[steering dampener].

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Just curious.  Is there a big difference between names brands of shocks?
Bilstein and KYB claim to improve the handling and wind veering of the bus,
but I'd like to hear some more about it from people that know.  &lt;&lt;
