&gt; The Bus Depot sells Cofab parts. So does The Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz. So
&gt; do just about all the parts ads I see in the various VW mags. I'm told
&gt; Cofab is a Mahle factory in Brazil, run by Mahle and making heads to Mahle
&gt; specs. A local mechanic I have some confidence in tells me I should
&gt; insist on only real german Mahle (or Kolbenschmidt, if I can get 'em)
&gt; because no Brazilian parts are as good. I believe there was a time when
&gt; that was true, but since reputable businesses like those mentioned above
&gt; (ignore the mag ads- they could be wankers) push the Cofab parts, I'd
&gt; guess they must be pretty good. The mechanic is an older guy, BTW, whose
&gt; opinion may well be shaped by market conditions of many years past.


While it may be true that Cofaps are made by Mahle/Brazil, this would
surprise me somewhat.  I have at various times obtained p&amp;c sets from Cofap
and from Mahle/Brazil.  They did not look the same.  The Mahle/Brazil ones
looked _identical_ to the German Mahles.  You couldn't tell them apart. The
Cofaps looked just slightly different.  Not notably worse but different from
the Brazilian Mahles in small details, as though they were coming from a
different factory or production run, or made to slightly different specs.

So when someone orders Brazilian p&amp;c's from me, I try to get the Brazilian
Mahles as my first choice, and ship Cofap if all of my suppliers are out of
Mahle. (Both are the same price.)  For German, I ship either Mahle or
Kolbenschmidt, again depending on availability.

That said, I have had no complaints about the Brazilian p&amp;c's of either
brand.  If you buy anyone's rebuilt engine, be it AVP, Mark Stephens, etc.,
Cofap is what you will almost always get.  I probably sell Brazilian 4 to 1
over German, primarily due to price.  There is always a group of people who
will consider nothing but original German parts for their bus, and they buy
the German sets. If it were my own engine, I'm not sure what I would do to
be honest.  If I could find Brazilian Mahle, I'd do that.  If not, I just
might spring for German,  figuring that in the scheme of things, considering
the time and expense of rebuilding, the &quot;peace of mind&quot; factor is worth the
extra $100 or so.
