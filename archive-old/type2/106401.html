&gt; I thought we were talking about a bus turning the same engine rpm, but
&gt; moving faster through space because of the larger tires. did I miss
&gt; something (not unheard of)

right but rpm is not the only measure of enigne work, the rpm might go
down but the torque required will go up...longer fulcrum, less work more
distance, shorter fulcrum, more work less distance bottom line is still
equal.  if it were  that easy all cars would have 80 inch wheels
