Subject: Static Timing Questions

Hello All-
I have a '72 (Type IV) Bus. Tried my first tune up, plugs, wires, cap,
roter. I left the points in so I could practice setting them, they seemed
to be quite closed. Set points (.016&quot;) and started the bus, it ran better
than ever. The idle was a little fast but it had good power and ran
smoother than before. Today I checked the timing by the Muir Static timing
method. The light came on when the timing mark on the pulley was at 20 (far
to the left of 0). I reset it to the red dot (5 degrees to the right of 0).
Bus was hard to start had a very slow idle, less power and a flat out top
speed of 62mph. Went back and set the timing at about 12 (about half way
between the first 2 settings). Power is back and idle is faster, seems to
run very well. Now I don't know where it should be set. I am concerned
about overheating more than anything else since it runs fine now.
Is there a way to accurately set the timing with just the static light?
How do I do it? What do I set it to? Muir says 5 degrees before top dead
center. Is that the red dot? Could it be 5 degrees on the other side of 0?
I don't want to damage this engine. Please let me know what you think.
