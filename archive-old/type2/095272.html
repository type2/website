Subject: Type 2 List Hat

Dear List:

I am the guy who did your Type 2 List Hat. I've been gone a while. =
Please endulge me while I tell you why I disappeared.

Aug 10th of last yr I was getting ready to park my 93 Eurovan at the =
Post Office and was re-ended by a Ford Expedition. Eurovan was totaled. =
Oct 12th of '01 I blacked out driving my Jeep Cherokee to work, hit a =
Lincoln head-on totaling both vehicles. Since that time I have undergone =
extensive tests to determine the cause and to get my suspended car =
insurance back.=20
Never found a medical cause, got my insurance back a few weeks ago and =
now I don't drive by myself. It means I only get to be a vendor at local =
VW shows.

Next, early this year I stupidly put 6 hats on Ebay with Drivers feared, =
Campers Wanted that included the design that no longer appears in ads in =
all our VW magazines. I received many threatening letters from =
Continental Enterprises on behalf of VWOA and they finally demanded =
$6,000 damages for the 6 hats. With the help of my local dealer I got it =
reduced to a lesser figure still with 3 zeros after the number. I am not =
allowed by CE to tell how much they settled for. If you wondered, that's =
why there are so few VW hats for sale on Ebay.=20

I still have Type 2 list hats available and they do not have the design =
in a circle on the center of the hat as before. I signed a statement =
promising not to make a hat in the future with the design in a circle.=20

I have now come into possession of a supply of official dealer mechanic =
patches. They all have a white stiched background with lettering in =
black. The Certified Technician has a blue stiched edge. The Expert =
Technician has a grey edge and the Master Technician has a yellow border =
and I have a very limited number of them. They have this design in a =
circle. I bought them legally and I did not make them.

I cannot list them on Ebay for fear of CE demanding confiscation of =
them. I can only attend a few VW shows. I think you guys would have an =
interest in them. Is it appropriate to offer them for sale on this list =
to help me recoup some of the money I paid to VWOA? I'm even afraid of =
posting a photo of these patches but if you were ever in a dealership in =
the 60's or 70's you saw them on the mechanic's shirts. They are =
NOS--New Old Stock and have never been sewn to a garment.

If this is an inappropriate list, I apologize.

thanks
