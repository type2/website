Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

&gt; I think you have achieved clutch-trans mismatch. Despite the bolt holding
&gt; the flywheel to the crank, it is really part of the transmission, not the
&gt; engine. Your flywheel, pressure plate, and clutch disc must match the
&gt; *transmission*!  Use the ones that came with it and you will have no
&gt; problems, use a mismatched set and you will.

since we are I think talking early loaf here the mixed up options do not
occur as with later asst trannys. The clutch disc and throwout DO have
to match though. I think rather that his clutch cable may be just a bit
too long which, if you check the archives, seems to be not that uncommon.
The prevailing solution is washers under the wingnut.
Easier to try this first before pulling the engine back out which he can
always do later if the washers dont help.
