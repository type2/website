Subject: shifting box??? one more time...

--part1_f6.1fae70de.2a8b2f66_boundary

OK...
I'm back asking about the same problem...80 vanagon...the housing for the 
shifting mechanism???...some of you have helped me out but I still need to 
find a picture of how the buffer's and the shifting linkage connect [INSIDE] 
the housing box...I have photo's of the complete shift lever and linkage 
setup...except they don't show me the INSIDE...of the housing...even my local 
mechanic is a bit puzzled...and he's been a mechanic for almost 30 
years...not VW's but still ...anyway ...anyone with a photo ...drawing 
...etc. please let me know...I can send you my address if something needs to 
be mailed...shipping paid by your's truly of course :) ...hope is running 
thin here...days are getting shorter here in the great north east...don't 
drive the van in winter...BURRRRRRRR!!!...thanks again for all the help ...
