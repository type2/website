Roland and list,

Sorry, some confusion here.  Engine is AW014731 not ED, dist 231 181 005. dual
carb, manual trans.  Won't start or idle at 5deg BTDC which is the spec in the
Haynes book but runs a little better at 5deg ATDC and seems like it would like
to be advanced a bit more.

David Schwarze &lt;sde_at_home_dot_com&gt; said off list that removing the vacuum retard hose
(goes to flat inside part of canister) should make timing advance several
degrees and idle speed up significantly.  It doesn't!  Do I have a problem with
my vacuum canister?  The hose goes to the left carb right?

I totally appreciate any help

Jim

&gt; On yesterday's communications, Jim inquired why the 1800 ED from 1974 with
&gt; dual carbs and manual transmission didn't run right at either 5 ATDC or 5
&gt; BTDC. Checking the Bentley, the distributor model number that he is using
&gt; does not match with the one designed for that year and engine; in fact it
&gt; didn't appear to belong to the type 4 engine series at all. Interestingly,
&gt; the ED engine in 74 with dual carbs was supposed to be used with automatic
&gt; transmissions only, originally. So, until Jim determines the characteristics
&gt; of his distributor, or gets the proper one, he'll be having trouble getting
&gt; the engine to run right. It appears that quite a few changes have been made
&gt; in the vehicle since it rolled off the assembly line.
