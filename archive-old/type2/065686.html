Subject: Re: safety

There are extensive discussions on bus safety in the archives, 
concluding that the raised ride height and vehicle mass help a lot.
Maybe that is not the most neutral crowd... for a more objective 
view consider that the insurance companies will not ding you for a
surcharge like they would if you bought a Suzuki Samurai or Geo Metro. 
This their statistics -and I'm sure they have good ones- do not 
show disproportionate losses.

Other safety considerations: Starting in '71 you get disk brakes, and
there is an improved version a couple of years later. VW started
designing energy absorbtion into the front end of buses in '72, as I
recall. Each frame rail going forward splits into a triangular shape
that is deformable. I've never actually seen it, just read about it in a
book Ric Golen lent me...of course, a 72 will forgo an upright engine,
unless you retrofit one yourself...but that is another argument, er,
thread.

If its a camper you want, IMHO the rear-hinging pop-tops are more useful
- -make more space available- than the earlier front-hinged ones. I'm not
sure what year they changed, sometime early-mid seventies, again. More
knowlegable people can help out here.

What will you pay for a really good one? With the super cool colors
(nice yellow, orange, green and blue come to mind) and groovy
plaid-on-drugs interiors, the mid-seventies campers are collectors
items. For a good one, it seems to me the asking prices are about the
same as the equivalent condition vanagon ten years younger: $3-6,000.

Good luck,

Tom F.
