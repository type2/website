&gt;
&gt;It definately seems like the whistling is coming from my vent wing window
&gt;or passenger door seal. What can be done about the vent wing window? It
&gt;looks like replacing the seals on that guy would be a PITA. Plus the rubber
&gt;looks to be okay, not dry rotten at least.

Theodore(and listees),

The rubber hardens and shrinks with age.  It does hold up INCREDIBLY 
well(thanks to those crafy Germans), but if you put new rubber in the 
vent-wing, you will notice the difference immediately.  The sun and smog do 
terrible things to rubber.  The post between the wing and the rollup window 
is held near the bottom by a screw, that fits through an elongated eyelet.  
This eyelet rusts(frequently, if not always) and DOES become brittle, so be 
careful when manipulating the post into a better fitting position.
