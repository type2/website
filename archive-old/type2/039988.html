Subject: -running extra  outlets in your Westy

The talk about adding a boom box inspired me to rant:
If you don't even own a drill, the easiest way to run a spare positive 
wire from your spare battery is to run it through the little hole in the
bottom of your spare tire well (or drill one along the flat above the
well), then along the bottom of the closet, down the wheel well (behind
the site of the usual inverter in a Deluxe), and then your choice of a
connector put into the wall under your feet (rear seat), or in the wall
of the sink cabinet. I run the wire thru that nice blank space under the
fridge (remove that little panel first), and then into the sink cabinet
area under your water tank.  Simplest /cheapest way to get TWO  cig.
lighter outlets is to buy the splitter adaptor, and cut off both female
ends.  I drilled a 1&quot; hole in the wall of the sink facing the rear
passenger, and then glued it in place pushing it in from behind (glue
gun).  Nice flush appearance from the front.  Splice in your wire from
the battery, including a 5-8 amp in line fuse holder. I ran the (-) wire
under the sink clamp in the floor to get ground.
     If you already have a deluxe with a positive wire feeding thru the
closet to the inverter, just splice into that if you'll just run a fan
or electronics.  Speaking of deluxes, did you know that hole in the
panel holding the stove knob fits a perfect screw-in cig. lighter
outlet? (The kind with the big nut behind it).
