Well, it's getting pretty close to that time of the year 
again.  Time for the Bug-In, that is.  This yaer the 
location will be the same as it was last year, and the year 
before, and the year before, and the...you get the
picture.  This is Westside Volkswagen off of Highway 100 in 
Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, a west side Minneapolis suburb 
for those not familiar with the Minneapolis/Saint Paul 
area.  It will be held 13 June 1999 from 9:00 a.m. to
4:00p.m. (had to control myself from putting 0900 to 
1600).  There will be swap spaces, dealer booths, displays, 
food, drink, and a photographer from Hot VWs to take 
pictures of the show cars.  I got the Syncro in one of the
pictures two years ago along with my son and me.  If you 
get a good enough magnifying glass you can make it and us 
out!  The club bought five radio control Beetles, three new 
and two old, for racing.  The old Beetle models are rear 
wheel drive and the New Beetle models are front wheel
drive.  They look really cool!  They will cost about a 
dollar to race.  We had one of them at the club meeting 
last night.  They should be great!
