Subject: Re: Re: [T2] '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

I would probably have to agree with Glenn on this one. Even if the 14.5K miles on the odometer is original and accurate (a BIG if), the bus is still nearly 25 years old, and as soon as it begins to get driven regularly, things WILL start to go wrong.  A machine is like a vintage musical instrument, it needs to get regular attention and playing to keep its tone and &quot;balance&quot; for lack of a better word.  Plus, who knows what kind of attention it has gotten during those miles? Was the oil changed regularly and tuned regularly, even though the usage miles are low, these would still have needed to be done in timely intervals. I think that a lot of people think &quot;Hey, I'll spend an assload of money on a nearly new, low miles bus and then I won't have to worry about messing with all the maintenance and repair issues&quot; My bro-in-law wants a bus and he actually said &quot;I want to spend enough money on a nice enough bus so that I won't have to do anything to it except drive it around.&quot; But we!
 all know this is not reality.
My advice is: If you've got the $16K to spend, find a well-cared for bay with a nice, straight, rust free body. Don't worry about the engine. Spend up to about $4000 on such bus. Then have a VW professional build the engine of your choice, there are plenty of knowledgeable engine builders who will give you a warranty on the engine (which you WON&quot;T get buying the $16K bus). Dunno the cost of such a new engine but it shouldn't cost anymore than $2K-$3K. Spend another couple of Grand on body work and paint if needed.  Spend $1,000 on new rubber seals, tires, interior, and misc stuff, etc. Then drive your nice &quot;NEW&quot; bus with a warranty on the engine down to the bank and deposit the $6,000 that you still have left over. ;^)
FWIW, John Baker

Ridiculous.  Yes he is nuts.  I would rather pay $16k for one restored to
mint condition even with a lot of miles on the body.  There are so many
potential problems he is looking at.  Actually I would not pay that much for
any of them.  Besides, it's just a '78.  Low mileage 70's Westfalias are not
uncommon due to their common use as weekend vehicles.  In terms of
investment an older, much older one would be better, and the moment he
starts driving this garage queen it goes way down in value.  There are a
surprising number of low milage cars of all types out there and they are not
worth paying much of a premium since most will immediately need a fair
amount of money spent replacing all the stuff that has gone bad.  The best
way to keep a vehicle in good shape is to maintain it well and use it
moderately and often.  Sitting around is bad for a machine.  People put too
muh of a premium on the number of miles.  GW
