Subject: Upgrading to H4s

It's dark here when I'm driving home and my headlights aren't very bright.  The library/archives have a few things to say:

- bulbs get old dummy: get new ones.
- the voltage at the lights may not be at max. anymore and a new ground cable for the lights would make them brigher.
- Get a H4 upgrade kit (not DOT but what's the good in being legal when you accidentally drive off the road)
- Upgrade to a relay system so all that juice isn't going through the headlight switch

It seems like the answer is all of the above but what should I do?

Are there reputable H4 kits and ones to stay away from?  I'm a little hesitent to just order an expensive kit by description.
