Subject: Leaded/Unleaded Fuel

Hi All,

Sorry if this question has been asked before (I searched the archives but
couldn't find an answer). I have recently purchased a 79 2.0L Kombi which
currently runs on leaded fuel. My questions are: will it run on unleaded?
and, if so, is it just a matter of switching, or do I need to do something
else? BTW, I am in Australia and I do believe (from what I have read on the
archives) that the engines here are different to those in North America. 

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Nicholas McLaren
