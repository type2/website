Subject: Re: Fixing the Sunroof 

lame-ass parts plea:  anyone got the nameless (to me)
little gizmos that actually slide on the track and do 
the pivot thing at that last moment when the slider
seats and seals itself (ha!) to the fixed roof?  they
are little, have an adjusting screw, and can't take
much umph -- at least not as much as i need for my
rather warped, rather balky sunroof on the '78.
