Hi Pat,

I just finished the installation of a rebuilt motor in my 79 westy.  I also 
installed a &quot;Miller Fuel Injection&quot; K-jetronic set up (CIS from late 70's 
rabbit/jetta) in place of the stock L-jetronic FI.  I didn't pass at first 
either.  HC were 600ppm and CO was around 6%.  I tried mixture adjustments 4 
times on the CIS equivalent to the AFM and got to 400ppm and 1.5%.  Still not 
good enough. (standards for 1979 are 220ppm HC and 1.00% CO)

I located and repaired a significant intake manifold leak at the right 
manifold/head seal, did a valve adjust on the now fully pumped up hydraulic 
lifters just to be sure and replaced the cat. conv.  I failed once more, 
drove out of the test station, pulled over, leaned the mixture screw out 
almost one more 1/4 turn, went through again and passed with 31ppm HC and 
0.00% CO. 

So....., I think in my case I may have been able just get by with the repair 
to the manifold leak but the cat. clinched the deal and I really do believe 
in doing everything I can to minimize my personal impact on those around me.

I was very concerned about what kind of emmissions I would get from the K-jet 
on the type IV and whether I could get it to pass at all.  I was impressed!!  
It is SO much simpler than the L-jet with no computer, pulsed injectors, temp 
sensors, ground connections etc.  

MY plugs look great, temp seems fine and it runs smoother and with more power 
than any bus I've ever had.  No fuel economy data yet as I've only put 120 
miles on the conversion and engine so far but I'm optimistic.
