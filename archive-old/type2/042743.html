Subject: Fw: blue smoke from tailpipe means ...?

&gt;... the bus was standing for about 10 month in an shed,
&gt;until I wanted  to pass the (german) smog test. When I started the
&gt;engine, I saw a small amount of blue smoke from the tailpipe. I
&gt;couldn't drive the bus for a longer distance, so I let it idle. I thought
&gt;that the smoke would disappear once the engine was warm enough
&gt;and running for about 10 minutes. But it didn't ! It was even worse
&gt;when the oil reached it's operating temperature of about 90°C.


when the bus sits for a long time, strange things can happen.
carbon can soften in the combustion chamber and cause problems.
( gets behind valves and causes rings to stick in the pistons. )
some of these engines have valve stem seals to wipe the oil,
and these seals can get hard and break off in pieces...
although they usually aren't used any more, especially since
unleaded fuel has been around...

your good compression doesn't seem to indicate a problem...
i would run the engine longer, even drive it for 100 k, to see if
it will clean itself...

&gt;I checked the compression and it seemed good to me:
&gt;about 10 &quot;bar&quot; (= 1,000,000 Pascal; how much &quot;psi&quot; is that?)
&gt;on each cylinder (on the cold engine) .

one &quot;bar &quot; is one &quot;atmosphere &quot; or the pressure of air , roughly
14.7 psi at sea level. 10 bar is 147 psi.
a proper compression test is done with the engine warm, spark
plugs out, no gas supply, throttle wide open, and the same number
crankshaft turns per cylinder, 3 or 4 is good....

&gt;I also checked the valve lash (was O.K.). When I turned the engine
&gt;by hand for this purpose, I heard an unusual noise (sounded like
&gt;PFFFRRRRT on every movement of the crankshaft) when I was
&gt; near the #4 power stroke.

...this is the sound of compression, a good thing...

&gt; What happens in my engine?
&gt; Can I check anything else ?
&gt; Valve guides?


try this : since one cylinder head was replaced, and one not,
you can find if  one side of the engine smokes- remove the exhaust
at the cylinder head and run the engine, this will separate the
exhaust to isolate the problem ...
