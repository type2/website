&gt; I just bought a &quot;new&quot; bus a few weeks ago.  I drove it all the way home from

this the brown one that Bruce had???

&gt; of course it decided that it had to have some problems now.  When I drive it 
&gt; in town it can't seem to keep itself alive, its constantly threatening to die 
&gt; on me.  The more I drive it the worse it gets.  When I stop at stop signs, or 

check fuel filter, sounds clogged

&gt; idling too low?  The engine seems to get really hot as I've noticed as well, 
&gt; is it overheating part of my problem?   I thought it could possibly be that 
&gt; instead of my heat coming out in the bus that maybe its just blowing back 
&gt; into the engine, I really don't know...any help is appreciated, thanks.

if you stick your head in the engine compartment and shine a very very
bright flashlight around in there, at night dark spot. you should not see
any light on the ground, or anywhere.  this is especially a problem just
above the muffler. 

get a dip stick temp guage, it is drop in, no tool fit, later get the sump
sender and keep an eye on your engine.
