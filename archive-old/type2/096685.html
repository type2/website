Subject: Fwd: [T2] living in a VW

Giles:  My son did just that while he was a student at a certain 
university in Pasadena.  He lived in his '70 bus for a year.  He had 
a friend who was so enamored of this arrangement, that the friend 
bought a bus and lived in it for a year at a certain university in 
Stanford, CA.   The story goes that parking/living in the Stanford 
area had certain restrictions that caused the friend to build a false 
floor  of cardboard where the middle seat had been. He would sleep 
under this &quot;floor&quot;  to avoid embarrassing questions.  I never did 
hear how either managed showers/ bathing.
