Subject: Inexpensive headlight

[This didn't post the first time...]

Replaced all of the fuses, and got the headlights on, one of them anyway.
:O)

One headlight is a Wagner #M548, and the other is a GE #153.  The GE is the
one that isn't working.

I remember a thread on the topic of headlights, but they seemed to mostly
concern upgrading to a much better head lamp.

Is there something not too expensive available at WalMart or a common FLAPS
that will work for now?  I can get something nice later, but I need to get
them both working now, in order to get Giacomo on the road.

Thanks.
