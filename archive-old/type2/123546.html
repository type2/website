Subject: 73 Weekender for Sale

Good morning Type2

I am selling a 1973 Weekender Bus. 

It has a 1800cc split carb motor. The motor and tranny were rebuilt by
Gunther(?) in Holland  Landing North of Toronto about 10 yrs ago and since
then I have put about 10,000 miles on it. The bulk of the time it has been
in storage, so I had the brakes done and used it everyday this past
summer. 

It has the ususal Bus aliments, rocker on the driver side finished,
battery tray - what battery tray?, front beam  is okay on the right side,
not so good on the left....

I have owned it since 1988 and have never driven it in the winter, the
previous owner also did nto drive it in the winter.  Thus, while it needs
surgery, it is worthy of rebuilding. However, I have too many other
projects that all involve wood, so rebuilding the bus is not going to get
on the agenda. 

The rebuilt motor and tranny cost me $3000, I would like to get $1500 for
it. 

I am in Ottawa, thanks for listening, Jeff Rogers
