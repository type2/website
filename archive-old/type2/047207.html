Subject: [T2] Re: Aux battery set up

To run the accesories that are wired into the aux battery while the bus is 
running is exactly what the instructions that come with the kit says NEVER 
to do.  I recently purchased this same kit from Bus Depot and helped Chad 
(the original poster) install his kit.

Ron read the instructions in the kit you sell.  Maybe these people (HELLA) 
know something we don't. It is their kit. I personally am not running my 
accessories while the bus is running unless someone can prove the 
instructions wrong beyond a resonable doubt in my head.  I love my bus and 
do not any wrong to come to her or the $65 new battery I just installed.
