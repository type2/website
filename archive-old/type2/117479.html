the infamous tire fart....

&gt;     I have the stock OEM steel wheels on my transporter. I'm considering
&gt; getting new tires, what is a GOOD size to have? I'd like something that will
&gt; give me low rpms on the highway, but still give me decent handling. Not that
&gt; I careen around corners... but I want something tall so that my gears aren't
&gt; winding out at highway speeds, and I'd like something that isn't skinny and
&gt; narrow that'll cause my ride to be.. well.. scary.
&gt;  
&gt; Any ideas?

the biggest thing that I have found that will fit a stock rim and fit in
the stock wheelwell of a bay bus is 205R70-14   some folks say they can
get 215's in there but any I've tried rubbed on turning.
