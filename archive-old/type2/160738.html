Subject: Vancouver/Abbotsford area listees?

Hi volks,

My employer has me traveling to Abbotsford, BC tomorrow for an  
install. I'll be there until Friday. If there are any listees in the  
greater Vancouver area that would like to meet for a beer and talk  
buses, please drop me a line.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
