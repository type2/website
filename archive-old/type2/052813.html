Subject: Brake problem

I was driving along in my '79 Van and noticed smoke coming from the back - 
when I stopped it seemed to have been coming from the back wheel and there 
was a kind of burning rubber smell - as the problem after inspection was 
obviously not coming from the tyre I assumed it was something like the 
brake pad sticking.

I pressed the brake in a few times which seemed to unstick the brake pad 
and drove on - I then noticed that there was something weird going on with 
the braking action when using the brake pedal. The braking point on the 
pedal constantly changed from the normal position to right near the top 
(although luckily actually bringing the van to a stop was the same as normal).

Any ideas what the problem could be ?

Cheers
