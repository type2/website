Subject: Dieseling and electrical short 

VW novice at work... I just purchased a 72 bus about six weeks ago and
have two problems(for the moment).

Problem 1: Every time I want to drive it, I have to connect the negative
battery connection to the top of the engine. As I screw the connector
down, it gives off sparks and the a little red light turns on the
dashboard (looks like a copyright symbol). But as soon as I turn it over
and start the vehicle, the red light goes out and I drive. But if I have
to stop anywhere for an extended period of time, I have to disconnect
the battery otherwise it gets drained.

Problem 2: When I turn my engine off, it continues to run for several
seconds and then shuts off.

Are both of these problems one in the same? I'm not sure where to start
first. Would anyone be kind enough to tell me what I need to be looking
at.
