&gt;I would give the standard warning though. Be careful of the donor bus you

You're absolutely right, and I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that
seatbelts have a &quot;lifespan&quot; related to the stretching caracteristics of
their material...   I think it's something like 15-20 years....  As you
mentionned a seatbelt stretches when an accident occurs, and that
stretching helps to &quot;pad&quot; the shock of the impact.

So in theory, if you still have your original seatbelts on your 25-year old
bus, they might be &quot;too old&quot; to protect you efficiently, and it probably
would be a good idead to change them for modern ones! Safety first!

...and No I don't work for a seatbelt manufacturer.
