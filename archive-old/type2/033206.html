Subject: Weber DFAV 32/36 question

Hi Folks,

I've been working with my 1600dp engine to try to get it to run better
on cold starts (it runs pretty well when it's warm, but not when it's
cold). Cold idling is nearly impossible.

I've given it a tune-up (valves, plugs, dwell, timing, etc.), and I've
played around with the choke (the usual cold start culprit). 

I'm still suspicious of the choke and will keep tweaking it, but I am
also beginning to think that the air/gas mixture is off. 

How do I adjust this on a Weber 32/36? There is one big screw in &quot;front&quot;
below the air filter (&quot;back&quot; being the side with the auto choke), but
tightening or loosening that screw it doesn't seem to have any effect on
the carb! There is another screw with a spring on it that faces the fan
shroud. Haven't tried it yet.

What should I do to address the cold idle problem?

Dan Melton
