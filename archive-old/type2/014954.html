Subject: List Splits
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well until the next time the list splits and there becomes a list just for
69-71 bays with uprights I guess I'll get out of here for a while. The
volume of unread digests has grown so much and of course my '71 bus is
purring like a kitten thanks to all the help from you dedicated dubbers.
So until the next episode (which should be a fairly simple clutch change) I
will be lurking behind the scenes.  Thanks to all, and keep up the good
work admins!
