Subject: [T2] clutch clevis pin

The clevis pin which holds the clutch cable to the cable assembly
underneath the driver's feet in my '71 snapped and left me with a $95 tow
charge on Saturday night.  All this with a bushel of very expensive steamed
crabs in the Westy for dinner that night.

I pulled the assembly today and managed to scavenge an assembly from a '77
bus this afternoon.  The assemblies are identical but the clevis pin
thingies are not.  The '77 is about twice as long as the one from the '71.

My questions:

1. are the clevis pins interchangeable?
2. If not, where can I buy one of these?  I checked RMMW catalog but don't
see it in there.

Thanks, Jack
