&gt; 
&gt; Now I need new tires and wheels. The old wheels are in terrible, rusty
&gt; shape. The tires are old and make the bus feel like a tractor. My mechanic
&gt; said to get 6&quot; radials. I think this is referring to the tire, and not the
&gt; wheel, right?

   No, that's the wheel. He meant get 6&quot; wide rims. Or get 7&quot;.  And
while you're at it, might as well get 15&quot; or 16&quot; rims. That's 15x7 or
16x7, as opposed to the stock 14x5.5&quot; rims. 
   And then with the 15 or 16 inch rims, get a 225/55 or 225/50 low
profile tire -- check the tire dealers books to keep it the same total
tire height as stock. If you get the wide, low profile tires like that,
the sidewalls will be less flexible, and you'll have much better control
in windy situations. 
    Others will tell you to get LT rated tires, which also work very
well.
