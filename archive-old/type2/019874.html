Subject: no pulley

Hello,
Thank you for the correction Erin and Joe...and Nikki ;-)
I was under the impression that it was just a different pulley.  Is this
dished fan tin hard to come by....or does anyone have any lying
around...or know where a company is that I could get some from.  This is
my first time having to deal with this (the longer gen change) so....try
not to laugh too hard.

Thanks!
Isaiah
