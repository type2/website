Howdy Folks - 

While cruising on a level road at a normal speed yesterday, I heard a
pop and then the tenor of the engine noise changed - it became more
ragged. Now, especially when decelerating or going down hill while
engine braking, I hear what seem like a series of mini-backfires. Also
the engine is now running hot, so much so that when holding your hand
over the heat vent it becomes almost painful. Inspection of the engine
reveals noting untoward - all tin in place, all hoses attached, etc.
Background: 77 2.0 liter FI engine recently rebuilt, had been running
fine until this. Any ideas?
