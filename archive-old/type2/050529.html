Subject: [T2] 71 Westy Restoration Questions

Volks:
I'm ready to begin restoring my 71 Westy, but I have the following problems:
I only have weekends to do the work, and because I'm in the military and
live on base, need to go to the hobby shop to do the work. So, I need to
divide the work in portions that can be completed in a weekend. I will love
to hear from people who might be able to suggest how to accomplish this, in
the less painful way. What to do first? (Bodywork, interior, etc.) How to do
it faster (without sacrificing quality). The bus is running fine and I just
re-did the brakes.
It still needs:

1. Replace a few panels/bodywork
2. interior (minor work)
3. New window rubber
4. paint
Thanks in advance for any help.

Victor
