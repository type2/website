Subject: Lack of Acceleration

Aloha,
When I push on the gas there is a lack of acceleration at the beginning.
My van (Celia) lags for about 5 secs then it seems like the gas is finally
getting to the engine. I've had two vw mechanics look at it....changed the
fuel pump back to a bosch fuel pump, but the problem still exists.  HELP
ME AND CELIA!
Mahalo,
Heidi &amp; Celia 85 Westy with a cute smile :)
