Subject: removing ignition housing

Well I think I finally found the short in my electrical system (thanks for all
the reponses) I think it is the ignition switch.  Well with that said, I
followed Bentley's description of how to remove steering column and housing
assy. I got the steering wheel off (without a puller) and lubricated the shaft
and ignition housing it starts to come up and gets stuck about an inch or so
from being completely off.  When I pull now the whole steering column assy
pulls up.  I am stuck, it will not come completely off and will no longer go
down either.

Any ideas?

This is on a 73.

Peace brothers and Sisters,
