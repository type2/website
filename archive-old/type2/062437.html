Subject: clattering '72 noise--fixing procedures

thanks to everyone who has replied trying to help me.

i have resigned myself to at least taking off the head to check the
wrist pin and rod bearing.

question:  is it worth it to try to take off the head with the engine in
the van?  i really dont want to get into taking out the engine by
myself.

if there is a blocked oil passage, can i clean it reliably without
splitting the case?  of course i  would like to avoid this if at all
possible.  

my main concern is preventing this from happening again.  i would hate
to replace the rod/wrist pin bearing and then do it all over again in
another 10k miles.

thanks again

evan
