I have a problem and I don't think I am going to like the answer, but here
goes.  I have a type IV longblock that has about 6,000 miles on it ... not a
rebuild, brand new.  I was camping in WI this weekend and started out on my
3 hr drive home ... checked the oil before I left  a little low, but not
more than 1/2 to 3/4 of a pint and the oil light was working.  About 1/2 way
home (1.5 hrs) at no more than 63 mph in 60 to 70 degree weather the engine
was doggin out and if I pushed the eccellerator (sp??) down I heard a
&quot;rattle&quot; from the engine ... not bad but noticeable.  I immediately pulled
over and opened the engine compartment.  There was puffs of white smoke
coming out of the oil breather, but the engine sounded fine while idling.
The dip stick was not hot on the handle (metal on mine), but the oil on the
dip stick was hot enough to almost burn the skin on my fingers not quite but
close.  I shut the engine off and let it cool down, started it up and drove
about 40 mph for about another 5 miles to a Quick Trip type gas station.  I
checked the oil and was about 1/2 quart low ... I added the 1/2 quart and
let her cool down for about an hour.  I drove it about 60 miles home slowly.
It will not excellerate from a stop w/ any power at all, but I could cruise
at 55 mph or better if I wanted to.  When I went up small hills I had to let
it lose speed or I would get that small &quot;rattle&quot; from the engine.  When I
got home there was no white smoke and the motor didn't seem hotter than
usual.  BTW this oil was 10w30 and had about 1000 miles on it by the time
this happened.
What do you guys think is my problem and what can I do to test the theories.
I think this motor may still be under warantee, but I have not had time to
pull the literature from my files.

Thanks in advance
Mike
