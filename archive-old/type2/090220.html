&gt; I'll take that advice.  Now my question is how much line to buy, and
&gt; how many clamps do I need?  (I could wait until I get home and

&gt; the Bus Depot has them.)  The Bus Depot has 7mm line,  is it good line?

Sorry, Rob!  I got so into the rant on metric vs. inch that I missed the
original question!  Yes, 7mm is correct.  Ron's stuff is FI-rated, no
problem there and a meter ought to do everything.  Most of the sections
are only a couple centimeters long, connecting metal pipe to metal pipe.
