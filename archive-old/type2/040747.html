Subject: Re: gas additive to guarantee emmisions passing for inspection?

I think that the main component of this stuff is methanol.  It has the
effect of leaning the mixture out a bit.

It's a bit of a scam, really.  Most cars will pass smog on the first try
without any special preparation.  A lot of folks are nervous about this
and get the stuff as &quot;insurance&quot;.  If they pass, they are happy.  Even if
they don't pass, most people won't go through the hassle of applying for
the refund.
