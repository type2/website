&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I spotted a very clean, green late '70's Westy on the street this morning.
&gt; It had a clever homemade front bike rack that impressed me so much I
&gt; thought I'd describe it to you all.
&gt; 
&gt; It is attached to the top two bolts for the spare tire mount. The tire is
&gt; there too, but where the top two lugnuts should be there are two big fat
&gt; washers, and a big nut that somehow has a pipe threaded onto it. There's a
&gt; 15&quot; or so pipe covered with black rubber hose and capped with a PCV elbow
&gt; that makes a neat bike hook. The tip of the PVC elbow is capped with a PVC
&gt; plug. There's a bike cable locked to one of the front tow loops under the
&gt; bumper. This reaches up to the bike mount and can be used to lock the
&gt; bike. I presume you would hold the bike on the rack with bungie cords.
&gt; Bike was not on it at the time.

I'm not terribly impressed with putting the spare on the front, but if you
are considering hanging a bike from the same mount you should do some
serious thinking first.

The spare tire mount is attached only to the sheet metal and is designed
to take pretty much a vertical load from the tire.  It seems to work OK
for this purpose.

Add a bike rack to the spare tire and you add a considerable load that is
cantilevered ahead of the mount.  This will pull out on the upper
fasteners and push inward on the lower portion of the mount, forces for
which the bracket wasn't designed. If the upper
fasteners fail The next thing you will see is your spare tire and
expensive bicycle bouncing off the road right in front of your bus!

George
