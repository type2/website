Subject: RE: Single Cab Rear Window

Hi Folks,

What about using one of those kewl &quot;rear safari&quot; windows that the Cal-look 
show-Bus folks seem to favor?  You wouldn't have the sliding option, but you 
could have some flow-thru ventilation and could pass things thru the back 
window to the bed.

Just a thought....
