I've been reading the postings about generator charging lights coming on and 
it reminds me that I've had a similar problem with mine. I have a 1600dp  in 
a 79 with alternator. At night you can see that the alt light has a steady 
glow. Nothing affects the level of intensity of this glow. Not engine speed 
or a change in load, eg. lights on/off etc. Output from the alt is normal at 
a steady 14.4 volts. It's been like this since I bought the bus over a year 
ago. I had another vehicle with the same problem that I ran for years 
without any detrimental effects. I read a fix for this problem some while 
ago in a magazine but can't remember what it was, rectifier, diodes or 
something, but I'm sure it wasn't brushes.

Any answers for this irritating problem much appreciated.
