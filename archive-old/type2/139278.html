Subject: Clean oilways in case?

I thought I was ready to zip this case up, but I noticed oil on the 
threads where one of the studs bolts down. I'm not happy with this, and 
I have put off building the case.

  I had scrubbed the case out; all the visible surfaces inside are 
clean. I've run it through the dishwasher (don't tell my wife) and I've 
blown compressed air through the openings to the oilways. But for all I 
know there's a wad of steel wool somewhere inside my case.

How do I get this really, spotlessly clean?
