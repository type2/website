&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; Does anyone know where I can get one?  My steering coupler just decided 
&gt; to shred itself and it's the 4th tomorrow and I can't drive :( :(


So, apparently there's an identical Mercedes part.  Does anyone have the 
part number for this?  I think this may be my best bet in getting one 
today...

Mike
