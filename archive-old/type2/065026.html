Subject: Re: kendall oil..what about head temps?

What you guys are searching for is &quot;specific heat&quot;.  That is the amount
of heat a substance requires to raise its temperature.  Water is the highest
(I think) with a specific heat of 1.0 -- it takes 1 calorie to raise 1 gram
of water 1 degree centigrade.  Basically, water can absorb alot of heat 
without its temperature going up much.  Pure water is a great coolant, but
its boiling point and corrosiveness keep you from using it in autos.  It
is not a good lubricant, either (although it is used as the lubricant
on the feedwater pumps of pressurized nuclear reactors!) so you'd rather
not use it instead of oil.

I have no idea what the specific heat of motor oil is, or how Kendall's
compares.  A substance that is good at absorbing heat is also good at
getting rid of it.

Heat conductance is another factor, but is not much concern on liquids that
are free to flow.  Metals, and the fuzzy-oily-coating common on VW engines
is another matter.  Heat radiation is a third factor.  Things that absorb
radiant heat well typically radiate well themselves.  We all know that flat
black metal surfaces pick up radiant heat really well, but they also are
extremely good at getting rid of it through radiation as well.  A flat
black engine looks like crap, but will run cooler.  Polished metal sucks.

Thus the best cooling system has a liquid coolant of high specific heat,
is made of materials with high heat conductivity (and as thin as possible,
usually) and a radiant exterior surface.  Water, through a silver radiator,
where the outside is well tarnished would be great.  We make do with a
water/antifreeze mixture, a brass radiator (but usually tarnished black,
at least!).  Or we have a VW air-cooled beast, where the coolant is oil
(yuck!), the radiator is aluminum and shiny!
