Subject: Email lost yesterday from Website 
Message-ID: &lt;280e6f2a.243d0169_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Sorry to bug everyone with this, but I had a little mishap last night with my 
computer and I lost several email messages from my web address.  If you tried 
to reach me yesterday at either of these addresses, please send again.

Updates on my web pages:
I don't have my shopping cart installed yet, but I'm currently working on it 
and will soon have it up in running and including secure credit card 
processing.   

This time the problems were my fault, and I've gone over 2 weeks now without 
any problems with my service provider.  If I hadn't already had my digital 
certificate and shopping cart program setup, I would have bailed on this 
provider.

I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
