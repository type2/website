Subject: Re: [T2] sticky oil piston

Hi Craig et al,

The oil pressure relief valve at the oil pump end of the case allows cold oil to bypass the cooler - that is the thick oil wont go through the cooler and causes high pressure until it warms and thins.

So if you have very high pressure when cold but it drops when hot I would suspect that relief valve was sticking.

The second relief valve stops the pressure after the oil cooler exceeding a maximum. If this sticks closed then the oil pressure would stay high even when the engine was warm. Also if it was stuck closed then the pressure cannont be relieved via the oiling of the bearings ect as there is simply too much pressure and this will strain the seals at the oil cooler (or even burst the cooler) just as much as if the other relief valve sticks.

In your case certainly check both relief valves - but as your pressure is dropping once the oil is warm it would suggest a problem with the relief valve at the oil pump end of the engine.

Good luck

&gt; hey all - recent colder weather has emphatically demonstrated a possible
&gt; problem w/ my oil pressure: too much.
&gt; i am running a 71 universal case, doghouse, 20-50 highrev valvoline, 2
&gt; relief pistons and a schadek late pump; in the past, the oil pressure at
&gt; startup would go to around 95 or so, and come down to 60 at high rpm after
&gt; 3 or 4 mins (15-30 at idle). SOMETIMES the guage would wiggle from 90 to 70
&gt; at high rpms before dropping, so i suspected i had a sticking piston, but
&gt; with temps below 50 this week, i get pressures of 150 (!) at startup, and i
&gt; can't rev above 2200 for some time or it goes HIGHER. it also will take a
&gt; good 10 minutes to finally drop down to 'normal.'  i have NO desire to pop
&gt; the cooler - if that pressure is seeing the cooler that is. my questions
&gt; are: which piston is likely to be sticking, pressure or relief?
&gt; i have looked at several manuals, and it looks like the  pressure
&gt; switch/sender 'sees' pressure before the cooler, so perhaps everything is
&gt; fine and dandy, but it seems to me that the pressure relief valve working
&gt; properly would bypass the restrictive cooler circuit, and pressure should
&gt; drop as most of the oil flows straight to the bearings.
&gt; the pressure control valve would seem to be less of a culprit - and less of
&gt; a problem. if sticking closed, it would just send excess oil into the
&gt; cylinders; if stuck OPEN, it would normally be dumping my rod pressure
&gt; right to zero, but at 150 psi i worry a little less about this :P
&gt; 
&gt; i'll  look at both, but just wanted any one's input who has seen this
&gt; before for things to watch for.
