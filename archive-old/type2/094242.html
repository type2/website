Subject: Re: [T2] Torqueing front hubs

Thing is, Bentley provides a torque spec for this, and as original poster,
my torque wrench also does not work backwards.

I like the thick washer tip.  I do not have a dial caliper.  I think this
kind of think is a bit intuitive, really.  I have never used a torque spec
for the front hub an any car that I have owned.


&gt;&gt; Front hubs? What year is this? Is this something that you torque? What are
&gt;&gt; the torque specs?
&gt;&gt; I always just got them snugged up to take the slack out of the bearing and
&gt;&gt; then loosened them up just barely enough that they spun freely...but not too
&gt;&gt; freely.

&gt; 
&gt; You are correct sir(or maam [pc]),
&gt; They are most properly measured for adjustment the same way you measure
&gt; end play on your motors. Using a dial gauge or the feeler method they are
&gt; adjusted for .001 to .005&quot;.  One of the patron saints (muir or hoover
&gt; maybe) suggested that if you tighten the nut down snug and loosen it just
&gt; enough so you can move the thick washer with a screwdriver you will have
&gt; the correct adjustment.
&gt; Myself, I have a dial and feelers but have never adjusted the front
&gt; bearings the proper way, always opting for the washer/screwdriver
&gt; method.
