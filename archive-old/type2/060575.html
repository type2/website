Subject: Re: What is the List Convention re: Pricing

     I always figured that &quot;asking&quot; meant they are open to offers, lower
than the &quot;asking&quot; price, and &quot;firm&quot; means just that -- no less. At least
that's the common English usage. You &quot;ask&quot; for a certain amount, hoping
to get it, but are flexible. Essentially the same as OBO -- 'or best
offer&quot;.
     What &quot;asking ... firm&quot; means,  I have no clue, unless it means that
the owner has mulitple personality disorder???
