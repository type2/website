Listees,

I know this does not have any 68-79 content but I know that a lot of the people here that deal in used parts also have Vanagon parts for sale.  I desperately need a rear license plate door for a 91 Vanagon that has the EPA sticker intact.  My sister just bought a 91 Westy in Canada but the rear license plate door has been replaced with one from an 85, thus, an 85 EPA sticker which will not work at customs.

Thanks for any help you can offer.

Ed Woenker
