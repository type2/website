Hello All   What's this all about? I have never removed the trans with the 
motor unless I was changing the trans. It's not that hard and doesn't require 
any odd angles or stress to the output shaft. The trick is removing the back 
tin, coil and unbolting the cross bar at the body not the motor.   just less 
work and time which when your'e in the business equals money.  Later Mark
