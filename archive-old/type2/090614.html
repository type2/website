Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Cleaner Substitutes

&gt; Anybody know of any subsitiutes for carb cleaner?  In my area nobody
&gt; stocks the stuff you use to dunk the body in when doing a rebuild.  They
&gt; can special order it at $22 a gallon.  Wonder if anything else will
&gt; work.  All I need is a quart.

Really? The gallon dunk tanks made by GUNK seem to be in every auto parts
store here. You can use carb spray cleaner instead of dunking. The stuff
in the can appears less volitile to me but does the job after overnight
soaking.
