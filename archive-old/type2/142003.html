Subject: electrical fault Headlight/indicator circuit

Hi,
I am a novice when it comes to electrics so im a bit baffled about this one, 
when my headlights are switched on, both indicators (turn signals) light up 
(do not flash), while the indicators are illuminated by some kind of bleed 
from the headlight circuit they will not flash when a turn signal is activated 
(L or R) although sometimes one side or the other will work for a few mins 
before stopping working after a short while. Ive managed to DL a few wiring 
diagrams and can see some common brown wires that feed both HL and TS.... but 
i have to say im a bit intimidated bit the complexity.
If anyone has any suggestions about which areas I should troubleshoot they 
would be greatly recieved.

78 westfalia 1600 type 1 engine

thanks

ps Oh also internal lights (in the cab roof and in the rear passenger part) 
dont work either... not sure if this is a separate fault or if it could be 
connected

I have just finished doing substantial amonts of welding on the roof and 
windscreen surround,and a couple of times I forgot to disconnect the battery 
prior to getting the MIG out..... oops!!
