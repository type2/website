Paul,

Try ISP West in Carson ( http://www.vwispwest_dot_com/ ) - try do complete 
restoration as does West Coast Classic Restoration in Fullerton ( 
http://www.vwrestoration_dot_com/index1.htm )

I have e-mailed both of them for estimates, have not had any work done as 
yet.  They are very friendly, but are booked for a few months.  

I went locally (Upland), but they were all very unfamiliar with VW's and it 
scared me to have them try it.  These other guys seem to be professional VW 
folks who care about the work.

Good luck,
Rob
