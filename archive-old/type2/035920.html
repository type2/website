&gt; Anybody with the 71 bus, relocate your fuse block out of the metal bracket

You could buy aftermarket fuseblocks and mount them on the fresh air
tube stampings under the dash, maybe on the right side.  This is an
out-of-the-way but accessible area that I've mounted many things on over
the years.  Would require a lot of work but your fuseblock (and the
wiring that goes into it) would be more accessible.  You'd also have to
come up with an alternative location for the flasher and headlite
relays.

However, I think if properly clipped and screwed down the original
location is secure enough - just a pain in the *ss to get at the back of
it or the relays.  It's a really crappy location, IMO.  (I love the '71
bus, but would vastly prefer a simpler wiring situation a la my '60 Ghia
:-)

I note that the metal bracket holding the fusebox is mounted with two
sheet metal screws - one beneath and one above, right, on the bracket
leg.  The left bracket leg has a screw hole, but looks like no screw
hole in the body (and it would be hard to get at it anyway).
