hey all,
 about 3 years ago when I put my 76 westy on the road in Massachusetts
 I got car plates as well
 but i think i registered it as a transporter
 try to do it that way should save a few bucks
 good luck

 for now
 after i buy my new house with the 36/90 barn you know there will be a few 
busses
