Subject: Running 410F at 60mph! (head temp)

Hi VW buddy's,
Yea,. it's an old subject but still...
Here is the situation:
1973 Bus (1.7L stock, all VW parts)  with very cleaned and sealed 
cooling system, everything is well adjusted (Carbs and timming).
Every cooling parts (including the fan housing) were removed, cleaned, 
polish and painted (metal thin), EVERY seals is new, or/and in place! 
Thermostat is there and working fine.
Every heads fin were cleaned also! Carb are not perfect but fair enough, 
running a bit on the rich side.
Timming (new rebuild distributor) is within spec (only the vaccum can is 
old, but working!).
Valve are ajusted, heads were loose, specialy the left side, the 
compression was 90 on #3 and now 110.

OK, i bought a head temp gauge, it was showing 450F at 60mph, i return 
this one to the company, i just receive the new one, here are the 
reading at -5F (-20C) outside temp (it's cold like hell up here)!
Idle:225/275F (average)
Normal street driving: 275/300F
Freeway at 55mph: 380/390F
Freeway at 60: 395/420F

2 things:
first, i don't feel that those gauge are very precise! But when check on 
boiling water, the gauge was 220F (well, about that!!!)
Second, some people told me that the very low outside temp could affect 
the reading, by that i mean that the difference between the sender (at 
#3 plug) and the plastic connector (8in farther in the engine 
compartment) is to much??? (by the way, the sender is hooked under the 
#3 plug, after it goes through the plug seal in the same hole that the 
plug  goes throught, in other words, it goes all the way just beside the 
plug, could this affect the temp???) The wire was not cut at all, 
original length!!!

Any technical advice or personal experience on that matter, should i 
just use the gauge as an indicator!!! Just checking the big variation or 
should i be woried for real!!!
note: i can touch the left head by hand from below after i shut down the 
engine, does not feel like 400F to me at all????

Many thanks, Ben
