Subject: progress on my 76 bus at the body shop

Well since my last letter to the list about what tools i should have in my bus and the whole breakdown i had at a show in Hartford County Ct. The next moring i got my bus to the plastic sergueon aka body man i am having him replace both my doglegs the previous guy who did them did a half ass job. I sold the old pair laying on the ground about 4 years old totally horrible so far he cut the passenger side out and so far what i see he is a man who takes his time and cares what he does. So he starting to replace my whole front floor section in my 76 i jusat delivered the floor section to him totally i got it in the mail lastnight from CIP1. I can't wait to get her back all brand new and plus i have a brand new floor. In his shop he has 2 beatles he is working on i am totally impressed on his talent of being able to do such beautiful work well i will let everybody know how the end result is in about 1-2 more weeks. 

P.S. has anybody every used spray sound deadener in there bus i am thinking of using some and i need some imput
