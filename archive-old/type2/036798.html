Subject: Re: Adjustable FI -Mark Stephens Article  (fwd)

&gt;&gt;I saw an interesting article in this month's (March)  &quot;HOt VW's&quot; It was
&gt;&gt;about a new package of 96mm p&amp;c s for type 4s.

I had 96mm pistons/liners in Bluto when I bought him.  One piston had a
hole in it.  When I removed the cylinders I noticed that the skirts were
extremely thin.  To put a larger diameter cylinder in the same size hole
(in the case, without machining) you have to make the cylinder wall thinner.

Ah'l tell ya whut - I will not be running those 96mm jugs in my bus - ever.
The very slight increase in displacement over the 94mm units is not worth
the potential trouble because of the overly thin cylinder walls.  I'll get
my extra displacement from increased stroke, thankyouverymuch.
