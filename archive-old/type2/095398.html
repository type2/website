Subject: How to replace Pertronix w/points?

I think my Pertronix has gone out in my 79' Westy and I want to see if I can 
throw a set of points back in it until I can buy a new points replacement 
unit. Is this just a matter of putting the points back in, screwing them 
down, and setting the dwell or is there more to it than that?

If the Pertronix is gone, and I have to replace it, which is better; 
Pertronix or Compufire? Thanks in advance!
