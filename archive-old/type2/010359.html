list/JT,

I know this has been hashed, rehashed and hashed again, but it seems we've
never really gotten the definitive answer - i don't even think VW can answer
it, or maybe they just won't.

The big valve seat dropping fear applies mainly to type4 heads.  It happens to
type1 or 'upright' or 'beetle' engines, but not nearly as often or soon, from
what i hear.

Only reason i can think is that the type4 engines are bigger and if poorly
maintained, can run hotter than a type1, which make the heads crack sooner,
which makes the seats drop sooner, which connects to the kneebone,  etc...

Keep in mind, it is not the seat that fails, it is the head that fails to hold
the seat in place.

The type4 head is a complete redesign of the type1 head.  There may be
something inherent in the design of the head that causes this early failure,
but i have no idea what it could be.  Anyone?  

Also, maybe this is one reason VW no longer manufactures the type4 but is
still producing uprights?

Hope this doesn't make you more paranoid that your type4 is going to fly into
bits one day while doing 70mph beside a big tractor trailer.
Sorry - that *probably* won't happen. ;]

Reader's digest condensed question to list: 

Why do type4 heads drop seats sooner?

-clark in ky.


&gt; 
&gt; Now, am wondering about the issue of valve seats that everyone talks about.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
