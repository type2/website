Subject: Re: [T2] odometer speedometer ?'s

Yes I made a little mistake. I was in a bit of a hurry when I posted
that, I meant to ask about the tripometer. I found a speedo with trip and
have never seen one like that before. Sorry for the confusion.

&gt; Do we maybe have a misunderstanding of terms here?
&gt; 
&gt; The odometer is the &quot;miles counter&quot; incorporated in the speedometer, 
&gt; the one
&gt; you check to see how many miles are on the bus before you buy it.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the standard odometer is being confused with a &quot;trip odometer&quot; 
&gt; which
&gt; can be reset when you fill up with gas or start a long journey or 
&gt; change the
&gt; oil and adjust the valves?
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....

&gt; &gt;I was wondering if any of you know anything about the
&gt; &gt;odometer/speedometers for the early Bays. I found one and would 
&gt; like to
&gt; &gt;know if they are rare, or common. Were they available all years? 
&gt; Dealer
&gt; &gt;option or factory? Any info would be nice. I am not interested in 
&gt; selling
&gt; &gt;it, just finding out more about it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;  CAn you send me more info about this, I might have one and would 
&gt; like to
&gt; be sure  &lt;&lt;
&gt;
