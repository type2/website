Subject: missing retainer
Message-ID: &lt;0.8d081169.255752c2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

    Hello Everyone, when I pulled the valve covers off my heads during 
disassembly I found no retaining springs holding the pushrod tubes.  Is their 
absence highly unusual?  The tubes stayed in place fine without them (they 
would not push through the heads with considerable force).  Will it be 
necessary to replace the springs during reassembly?  I have a 1700 engine.  
Any ideas appreciated.
                    Thanks, Pete
