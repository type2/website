Subject: going to order a longblock - suggestions *please*
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990608103423.009399e0_at_deepwell_dot_com&gt;

while most of you would probably rebuild yourself, i have no such luxury.
i am severely constricted by time and money and *must* put a new longblock
in my '68 Campmobile.
i've been on the look out for distributers of rebuilt/new longblocks and
was dissapointed to find only a few.

unfortunately this is really my fist experience *ordering* parts of any
kind from such manufacturers/distributors, let alone an entire longblock.
i am pleading for some input on quality of companies - basically: where do
i go to get a motor that is going to last me a  few months at least before
i have to rebuilt it?
i promise to take very good care of it once it's in.

GEX - does not seem to have my motor that i know only as a 1600 dual port -
i suppose i can put in whatever if i'm getting a new longblock, so what
*should* i put in? a 1641? and what does &quot;rear mount&quot; specify?

AVP - appears to have what i want and i haven't heard anything &quot;to beware&quot;
of them as i have with gex. however, they also do not appear to have a 1600
dual port... and there's that &quot;rear mount again. should i be sticking to my
bus year?

VWPARTS - still don't know if the're talking about dual port, should i
abandon that altogether?

please, please tell me what my best options are, i want reliability and can
possibly afford $900 or so... my suspension and lack of tires/rims will
have to wait another week at least, but i need to put an engine in this
thing and *cannot* do a complete [my first] rebuild within my time limits -
there's just no way.

should i look in the paper for another possible POS engine to throw in
while i rebuild mine? i'll have to commute Donner Pass from Reno, NV to
Sacramento, CA about once a week and need to get over to my home in
Mendocino, CA [north west coast] at least once in the next couple of months... 
and then of course, end of August... Burningman.

i'm not trying to rush this, i assure you all, if i had the resources and
especially time i would do the complete rebuild myself and LOVE IT, every
minute...

i *need* to know who to go to purchase/order a longblock - suggestions
*please*.
