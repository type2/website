In nearly all cases it's necessary to fine tune your motor by ear. The key thing is to always check your total advance with a strobe light before you tighten the clamp. You can make adjustments by ear, and keep driving it around the block and listening and feeling until you think you have it right, then check your total advance too make sure it's not excessive before tightening the clamp down for good.
