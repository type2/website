Subject: RE: [T2] beam swap.

Clark,

There is no difference between the two beams. Just unhook, unbolt and drop
the beam.

Then raise, bolt and hook up the new beam.

Advice:
Don't leave the tires/rims on.
Have some type of protection for the front disc brake shields to rest on.
They dent and bend very easily
Pull the beam out from one side, don't try to go forward or aft.
Be ready for the beams' unbalanced weight, they are ungainly and heavier
than they look.

Items which need to be disconnected then reconnected:

Emergency Brake Cables
Brake Booster line
Front rubber brake lines
Master Cylinder to rear proportioning valve
Master Cylinder to front brake hard lines
Shift coupling rod
Heater Tubes
Accelerator cable
Master Cylinder wiring
Speedometer Cable
Front Shocks
Brake pedal rod to Master Cylinder

Maybe something else, but I think that is all that has to be removed then
put back on.

List,

I am contemplating a beam swap between a 74 and 75
bus.

The donor is a heavily undercoated 1975 auto-trans
westy and the patient is my 74 std bus.

Im thinking they'll just swap right out - rotor to
rotor.  A friend has built a little jack-mounted jig
for beams, so moving it around should be pretty
simple.

Anyone ever done it?  Any advice?

TIA, 
Clark
