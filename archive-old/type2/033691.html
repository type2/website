Whale top camper

I am unfamiliar with this term. can somesone enlighten me?

I am getting a metal scrapeing noise ( a high pitched sound) only when I
turn sharpely to the left in my 71 bus.  I have removed the left front tire
and inspected, but see not signs of rubbing . The pads are new  ( the noise
did not start with the pads tho).

Thanks for the onfo.

Rick
