Tom
I'd agree with some of the other posters, a timeing light is nice, but for
an upright you can do just fine with a homemade bulb tester and a set of
feeler gauges. Save the money for quality handtools that wont shear off
bolts or break in your hands.

Subject: [T2] Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?


&gt;
&gt; Greetings Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I just helped 2 wonderful young women pick up a 1969 Transporter with
&gt; a strong engine at a pretty reasonable price, but, they spent a bit
&gt; more than they wanted to (or had budgeted for) for the sake
&gt; of a good running bus.
&gt;
&gt; That being the case, they're trying to spend as little money
&gt; as possible to pick up the tools they'll need to maintain it,
&gt; notably, a timing light, a tach-dwell meter, and the associated
&gt; tune-up tools.  None of these items is particularly expensive,
&gt; but to someone with very little cash in the bank (&lt;$200), these costs
&gt; add up quickly.
&gt;
&gt; That said, if anyone in Southern (or Northern, as they'll be headed
&gt; there soon) California, or anyone who wouldn't mind shipping stuff,
&gt; has some old tools lying around that aren't being used
&gt; that they'd be willing to part with for fairly cheap, please
&gt; let me know.
&gt;
&gt;  As far as other concerns regarding travelling on little money, etc.,
&gt; these lasses have plans on picking up work, have plans (credit cards,
etc.)
&gt; for contingency monetary requirements, and have lots of friends/family
&gt; along their planned route, they're just looking to cut down on as many
&gt; costs as possible.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this finds all your volks well, and having a nice Friday...
&gt;
&gt; -tom
