Subject: Re: [T2] Paint

Billy sends:

&gt; These sound like fine products for a quality job which I cannot afford right
&gt; now. I am saving my money for the paint itself. I think it's important to note
&gt; for the low budget crowd/newbies that you can, like me, derust with the
&gt; wirewheel/naval jelly, rattle can primer and paint, then paint over all that
&gt; if that's all you can do.

Then use tractor paint, or Rustoleum's &quot;Industrial Paint&quot; (we have it at
Home Depot; I used some on a printing press once and it's very usable)
instead of rattle can paint. Better and cheaper than the stuff in rattle
cans.
