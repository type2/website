Subject: Re: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

IF there was anyway to keep it sliding forward off of the perch of the rear 
bed and slamming into the rear of the front seats and then bursting 
flooding the front of the bus.

I imagine the car next to this bus staring at the driver and passenger 
inside the flooded cab, water over the front windows, gropping for the door 
handle...

Wonder how bad that would swell out the nose - probably would look like a 
VW bus with a bee sting right on the nose...

Bet a bus like that would go cheap.....

Air mattresses are alot cheaper...

&lt;grin&gt;

&gt;Apart from bursting, the other thing about not driving with
&gt;it would be its effect on weight distribution. As a floating
&gt;mass it would shift forward as you brake increasing the
&gt;likelyhood of lockup, and it would probably effect your
&gt;cornering as well.

Ciao!
