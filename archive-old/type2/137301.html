Subject: Re: [T2] altitude -advancing vs low octane gas found at
  altitude

2 qu- re &quot;leaning&quot; the mix on a FI bus, and octane of gas found at altitude:

  &quot;noticed this (loss of power) big time on my trip from California to 
Colorado.  I had to lean out the 76 about a turn and a half from its sea 
level setting.&quot;

1. We have the 78 with never rebuilt engine (244K mi)- on our 
crosscountry trip in 95 I advanced the timing across the Rockies.  How 
do you lean out the FI '76 without messing with the resistance/vane 
position?  The screw one adjusts on the afm only affects the idle 
curcuit, is my understanding.

2. I noticed that the octane of gas at altitude is lower- can the 
chmists here explain this- and if one advances their timing,  should a 
higher octane gas be used.  I guess what I am asking, how does advancing 
the timing help the power on what is essentially a rich condition?
Also, even if one improves the mix by leaning, isn't it still less 
burnable mix going in to the cylinder?
