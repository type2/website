Subject: list sticker repro?

I will be one of those recipients.  I could see what i can do about getting it
reproduced and maybe cut a new batch.  Would that be okay, admins?  I could
either offer them to the list for free or donate them to one of you guys and
you could sell them to support the list.

Am i asking for it with this?

&gt; To my knowledge there are no more list stickers. I have 30 of them left but
&gt; they are promised to the first 30 people who sent money during the last
&gt; round of list fund-raising (I have the names and addresses of you folks,
&gt; just haven't sent them out yet, I'll get on that).
&gt; 
&gt; So sorry, but it it is probably pointless to post any more messages about
this.
