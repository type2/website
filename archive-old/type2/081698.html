Subject: On To Everybus!

Both Canadian contingents are in my back yard at  this moment. One group =
left Wednesday morning with the idea of being here (Round Hill, VA.) =
Wed. night, but TWO fuel pump failures back to back delayed them until =
last night. The plan is to leave here around 8:00-8:30 this morning, =
taking Rte 15 to Rte. 29, with a stop at the Sheetz in Opal Virginia to =
meet up with some folks, and a stop at the Wal Mart in Charlottesville =
(just to p*ss off security, since they had a fit  last year when we =
stopped there) We will monitor CB channels 2 and 14. May everyone going =
have a safe and trouble-free trip!    Jeff
