Hi, 
I have a 1979 red and white V.W. bus for sale.  It was garaged and not driven
for most of it's life so it only has a little above 54,000 miles on the
original engine.  The body and interior are SOOOOOO very clean and no rust.  I
have made new curtains.  There is a sleeping platform with mattress in it
not(which can be removed)  The middle bench seat is available if desired.
Where can I list it and how much should I expect to get for it.  I know what I
paid for it..........
Any suggestions.
Thanks,
Maryh
