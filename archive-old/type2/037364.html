Subject: Looking for Body Shop in NH or VT

Bussers,
The mechanical work on the Turtle is done, and I was able to do engine
rebuild, brakes, electrical, etc. myself.  Now comes the body work.  The bus
is generally quite sound for this neck of the woods, but it needs rockers
replaced and other minor repairs.  Other than the stripping, I don't want
any part of the prep/paint.  Does anyone have a recommendation for a shop
that has some knowledge of Type 2, or is there anyone out there that would
be interested in the job.  It seems that for the most part, the shops I've
dealt with are uneasy about the project.  TIA.
