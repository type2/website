CCC's

I think y'all ought to reconsider Death Valley, or at least the surrounding
areas.  There is Wild Rose campground aways up the western slope, which is a
long day hike to the top of Telescope peak.  The Saline Valley is also big.

If not then consider Whitney Portal, west of Lone Pine and a tough climb up
from the Owens Valley.

Maybe go back to Lake Isabella?

Shoot, just go to 'Vegas and gamble.  I won $205 dollars on a quarter once.

I guess it's time to get out Tom Steinstra's book.
