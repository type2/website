Subject: Subaru --&gt; Type II ...Part 1 of 4 

Disclaimer:  Dimensions for bell housing assembly are from a 1600cc Subaru
retrofit.  I haven't measured yet to see if the distance from the rear of
the crank to the rear of the block are the same on the 1800cc.  The 2
features which have to match the VW are 1.) Distance from transaxle locating
face of bell housing to clutch disk surface of flywheel. This can be easily
measured on a VW engine with flywheel installed. 2.) Concentricity of
locating flange (ring) to crankshaft centerline.

(If you make it thru this part, the rest of the project is cake)

Part 1: Fabrication and machining of bell housing.

Needed:
1.)     Bell housing off of your Subaru engine.
2.)     1/2&quot; aluminum plate as big as a VW bell housing.....$25
3.)     Aluminum welding rod....$10 - $20.
4.)     A good (aluminum) welder.    $Beer (if you bring the rod)
5.)     Machinist with CNC mill or manual mill w/rotary table.  $a LOT of beer
6.)     A VW engine &amp; transaxle just laying around to fit and measure stuff.

Study the VW 'flange-type' bell housing.  Study the Subaru 'bell-type' bell
housing.  Look at your aluminum plate.  Your new bell housing will only be
1-1/4&quot; thick.  Visualize what you are going to make.  Do this for a long
time.....

A.      Cutting down the Subaru bell housing.  (Machining)..(This is the
toughest part)


Detach bell housing from engine.  Set aside the steel reinforcement brackets
that go from the top of the engine to the bell housing.

Clamp down to mill table with the Subaru side down.  Mill until it is .970&quot;
thick.  I suggest milling from inside out with a 'Hog' style end mill.

B.      Layout and cut aluminum plate.

Using a transaxle for a template, layout with a marker the general shape of
the VW bell housing on 'cereal box' grade cardboard.  Leaving the shape
round where the 'flats' are won't hurt.  I did this for extra strength.
Leave material on bottom edge to later match up to the oil pan 'mating
surface'.  Leave plenty of material around the VW attach hole locations.
Mark the hole locations with a marker, then center punch them for reference.

Transfer your cardboard template to the aluminum plate.  Saw or torch the
plate outside and in.  Make sure the inside slightly overlaps inside the
bell housing.  Drop a flywheel into your assembly and check for clearance
with the flywheel centered.  Once every thing is lined up, drill and tap a
couple of holes at 3:00 and 6:00 for some 10-32 screws to hold plate to bell
housing until welding.  Consult your welder and he will tell you how much to
grind weld chamfers all around.  Big chamfer at bottom between Subaru &amp; VW
halves of oil pan mating surface.  Clean and chamfer elsewhere, per welders
instructions.  

C.      Welding the assembly.

Weld everywhere possible.  There is nowhere that too much weld will affect.
(This part can't be seen easily when in the vehicle, so don't worry about
massive piles of weld).  Get maximum penetration across bottom at oil pan
mating surface to allow for re-machining this surface.  Build up areas
around lower hole locations (center punches) as much as possible (full
thicknes of assembly).  Build up top hole areas to a little more than stock
VW thickness.  (There went $20 bucks worth of rod)

D.      Machining the assembly

The next stap CAN NOT BE OMMITTED because your assembly IS WARPED from welding.

Clamp the assembly to the mill table, Subaru side down.  Clamp lightly
keeping assembly in a 'free state' (do not distort).  Mill the 'plate' side
just enough so that most of it cleans up.  Now flip over and clamp with
plate side down (on fresh machined surface).  Mill the Subaru mating surface
just enough for 100% cleanup.  Surfaces are now parallel again.

Clamp (with Subaru side down) onto a CNC or rotary table.  Indicate in
center bore.  Indicate across oil pan mating surface to line it up.  Machine
the VW flange (ring) to the same O.D. &amp; I.D. as a VW engine. (Sorry I don't
have the diameters handy).  Thickness of assembly (not including ring should
finish at 1.220&quot;.  Mill lower edge of assembly to match up with oil pan
mating surface.

Hand grind around top bolt holes for mating to steel brackets.

E.      Fitting assembly.

Fit assembly to transaxle.  Level it and drill some pilot holes at 4
locations.  Drill and tap the lower holes for 12mm studs.  Drill the top
holes to clear 12mm bolts.  Attach assembly to engine using 2 drill shanks
where dowel pins go.  Bolt up.  Remove drill shanks and tap holes for 3/8-16
bolts (they are already the right diameter for threading.  Now drill thru
bell housing only, to clear for 3/8 bolts.  Remove assembly for final
cleaning.  Re-attach with added bolts.  Install a new seal immediatly.

Find the steel reinforcement brackets.  Heat them up and bend them around to
fit new VW hole locations.  Weld a 12mm nut to the starter side brackets.
Screw in a 12mm stud to right length (see VW engine).  Lock with another nut
against welded nut.  Note:  This must be done because you can't access this
area later to use a bolt.  The other side can use the std. VW bolt.  Screw
some more studs into lower holes using loctite.
Note:  12mm hi-grade all-thread can be purchased at a Bolt &amp; Nut supply store.

If this sounds like a lot of work, it is.  If you have to pay a machine shop
to do the machining, you are probably better off buying the Kennedy Adapter
kit.  I'm not trying to discourage anyone but it was easier for me because I
have a CNC mill and a friend who welds.  If you can find a Kennedy bell
housing on a boneyard engine, you can skip this whole step, also.

Any dimensions that I left or you are not sure how to get, please request
and I will dig out my notes or head for the garage and measure again.

Next step:....(way easier from here!!).....Modify flywhell.  Fabricate pilot
bushing retainer.

Mark....
