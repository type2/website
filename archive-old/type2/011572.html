Subject: [T2]Thanks for help with stuch push rod tube

Hi All,

Thanks a ton for everyone's help! 
After some fiddling with vise grips the push rod tubes popped right out.
I'm done, thanks to your help (and the archive) I also ajusted the valves.
Now it's time to put on my party dress!

And I keep forgeting I have a 1700 not an 1800! (wish full thinking)
