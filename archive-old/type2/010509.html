List,

I packed my CV joints with standard axle/bearing grease.  THEN, i read the
manual about how much to use. 20-20 hindsight.
The grease i used was not black like the grease that was already in the CVs
and i'm sure i used more than the manual specifies.

Am i gonna blow the boots out?  Is standard axle/bearing grease wrong and if
so, why?

thanks,

clark in ky.
