Ha, Ha! Yeah, at first I was worried that there wouldn't be enough room for
our mechanic to move in, but he just hangs out in the bus and comes in to
snuggle when it is cold!

So I have *got* to get this heater sorted out!

 I checked out the infamous &quot;Heat in a VW van&quot;
http://www.bulleyhewlett_dot_com/VWindex/, and was a little overwhelmed! I think
that we might try to implement some of his insulation ideas, but taking out
everything in the bus and coating it 8.000 times with each different
substance sounds like too big a project for our first one! My boyfriend did
pull out the water pump and it looks like it doesn't work. It looks like
these cost around $100 bucks? We were thinking of getting a little RV pump
from home depot and then rigging it up, Whaddya think? I did read the
library page on it and so it seems doable, but just wanted to get the
stories from you guys!

Thanks!

my bus came with a bag of pot crammed in the drain pipe from the sink.  I
couldn't figure out why the sink wouldn't drain.... not to mention more
condoms wrappers than a frat house....
