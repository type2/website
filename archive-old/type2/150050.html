Subject: Steering Column parts

I am in the process of putting my steering back together on my 68 DC
restoration.

In the exploded view of the steering column (Bentley Chapter 2, Page 27, fig
9-12) it shows 13 as &quot;seal&quot;. I have taken apart a few of these columns and
have never seen a seal at the lower part of the column tube.

If there is supposed to be one, does it sit on outside or the inside of the
column tube?

Is it NLA? I haven't been able to track one down in any parts catalog.

Does anyone have one or know of a good home-grown replacement?

What is the purpose? Does it protect from grounding? Is this why my 70 DC's
horn keeps shorting out?

Thanks,

-- Jon Stiles
