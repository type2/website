Subject: Windshield repair or replacement

I have a crack in my windshield that is starting to grow.

Has anyone had any experience with the process of filling such 
cracks. I would not be doing this myself, but having it done by a pro.

Or would I be better off having the windshield replaced?

Have a good day.
