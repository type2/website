Subject: reverse light mod..
Message-ID: &lt;002001bf2573$cc2f9380$f804fea9_at_USER&gt;

    Is there a way to inroduce a Reverse light indicator to the dash? Would
this just involve running a wire from dash light to the reverse light so
when it is engaged the light on the dash will go on? Reverse is a tricky one
most will agree( i hope, or im a fool) and Im constantly in 2nd instead. Its
a little embarassing lurching slowly forward until I find reverse.
Sometimes, mostly, Ill find it by blind luck. But I thought If a light on
the dash would show me I am in reverse I would idiot proof my self from
myself. :)
Thanks in advance!
