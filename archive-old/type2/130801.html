&gt;&gt; This depends on driving style but 50-75,000 miles could be a good

&gt; ???  I don't understand this, I've had many VW's and every one that I 
&gt; had
&gt; long enough (all 4 of my buses) went over 100,000 miles including the 
&gt; 1960
&gt; which had that weak little beetle engine in it.

Bob,

I bought a rebuilt engine in Southern California for ~$700 (+/- $50) 
from what was at one point a reputable builder.

That engine has just been retired after ~33,000 miles (endplay is at 
0.035&quot; and not correctable).

I babied it, didn't let it run over 220-230 F oil temp, checked and 
adjusted the valves regularly, changed the oil regularly, etc.

I even installed a type-IV oil cooler in the doghouse (and it was a 
dual relief (i.e. big passages) case).

Lots of things happened -- and were fixed -- along the way, but all in 
all, I babied that engine when it came to valves, oil temp, and oil 
changes.  We're talking about stopping every 15 minutes if the temps 
were too hot.

So, now I'm building my own engine and doing it right.  This first one 
is going to cost me about the same as that rebuild did: about $600 give 
or take.  It's a &quot;cheap&quot; rebuild -- I'm not going all out because I 
figure I'll make some mistakes with my first rebuild -- but I'm not 
skimping, either.  It will have full flow, be a single-port, and have a 
type-IV oil cooler in a dog house.  I expect to get many, many happy 
miles out if -- if i'm lucky, over 80,000, maybe even 100,000.

I had figured that knowing what I know now about the builder and how 
the engine was put together, I would be lucky to get 40,000 miles out 
of it.  Unfortunately, I haven't hit that yet (but we'll see, she'll be 
a hot spare for a while).

Granted, 20,000 of those miles were covered over the course of 6 
months, but...

*grin*

As with anything, your mileage may vary.  Had I to do it over again, I 
might go with a new Mexi engine, or I might not.  Who's to say which 
path I would have learned more on.  I'm glad that you've had better 
experience with your VWs, but let's just say that even with due 
diligence, things don't always work out the way you plan.

Keep on bussin'!
