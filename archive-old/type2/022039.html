This sort of odd light behaviour is usualy down to bad 
grounding of the light cluster. The current illuminating 
one bulb cannot earth so goes the 'wrong way' through 
another bulb and then earths through another bulb on 
the same circuit.
I've seen front indicators come on when people press 
the brake pedal, and they are realy impressed when a) 
you tell them and b) you know whats wrong.
The rear lights holders are mounted in a metal plate 
which acts as a common earth for all the lights in the 
cluster but requires a short length of wire to connect the 
plate to the chassis. This wire may have fallen off, 
otherwise a quick rub with some emry paper on the 
conacts both at the plate and where the wire connects to 
the chassis should solve the problem. 
Do the other side at the same time and you should not 
have a recurrance for a good few years.

Good luck

&gt;Any light experts out there?  I can't get the right side 
back lights to
&gt;work.  When I put on the right turn signal, the right 
back middle (running
&gt;light) blinks (all other lights perform correctly).  When 
I press the brake
&gt;pedal, the right side back light all but goes out (Gets 
extremely dim) and
&gt;the left side gets very bright.  With the running lights 
on, both sides
&gt;work but the right side is a little dimmer than the left.  
I had to repair
&gt;the flasher switch - it had fallen apart.  Before the turn 
signals and
&gt;emergency flashers were out all together.  I don't see 
any obvious
&gt;problems.  I took the gauge panel out to see better.  
&gt;
&gt;Continuing search...
