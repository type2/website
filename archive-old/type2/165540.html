&gt;&gt;   Then, with it running, I checked the voltage, negative probe to 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;engine(ground) and positive probe to the negative terminal of the 
&gt;&gt;coil,
&gt;&gt;there is7.3 volts, between engine and positive terminal, there is 
&gt;&gt;13.6
&gt;&gt;volts.
&gt;&gt;   Does this appear normal?
&gt;
&gt;Yes. Also, your points are set to about 48 degrees of dwell, which is 
&gt;just fine.

Oops. I worked that backwards - you're set to about 42 degrees of 
dwell, so your point gap is slightly too big. That should not cause the 
points to burn, though.

To figure dwell with a voltmeter, measure as you did, then divide 
(7.3/13.6 = .54 percent), for a 4 cylinder engine multiply by 90 
degrees (.54*90 = 48 degrees), that gives you the &quot;anti-dwell&quot; (i.e. 
how long the points are open). Subtract from 90 to get the dwell angle 
(90-48 = 42 degrees).

This works pretty well as long as the meter shows a stable reading when 
the engine is running (which indicates the meter is averaging the 
voltage well). If the numbers bounce around, it will be less accurate.
