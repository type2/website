Subject: Re: [T2] main #4 bearing dowel pin loose

Mike,

You can get the case modified to accept a larger pin in the case
with the normal end for the bearing.

I have only seen this once and had it done on a case that I almost
ruined...not from running, but after it was out of the car.

They made a &quot;special&quot; pin to fit.

Piece of cake for a machine shop.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The dowel pin on the #4 bearing is slightly loose in it's hole.  It
&gt; looks like the #4 main bearing siezed up because it's really hard to
&gt; spin.  Does this mean the case is shot?  This is what it says in the
&gt; library:

&gt; Thanks,
