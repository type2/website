Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

Eureaka! The taste of success is sweet after over a year, my newfound 
friends!

On the suggestion of Jeff, I checked all the intake connections, couldnt 
find anything.  It made sense that too much air was the problem, since it 
was only at idle.  Therefore, I took off the brake booster line, and sealed 
it off with a bolt and more electrical tape than one man has any business 
using.  Fired it back up, and bam!  Smooth as butter (well, butter after you 
drop it in some gravel).  I still dont know about the timing, it seems to 
run well at about 8BTDC, with the advance plugged.  Since it was suggested 
7.5 for the 009, that sounds half decent, right? I still dont see why Haynes 
says 5ATDC.  It about died when I got near TDC.

I dont have a bentley, can you give me the actual title of that?  I have a 
haynes for the car, a haynes for the weber, and a different manual (dont 
know the name) that came with the car, in a binder.  The book itself has a 
green cover, but I never really cared what it was called.

My engine code is CB... any suggestions based on that?

Thanks a lot guys.  My fortune cookie at lunch said (I have it in my pocket 
here...) &quot;Your luck has been completely changed today.&quot;  No kiddin!  It also 
told me how to say March in chinese, but that is much less significant. :)
