Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh air flaps

&gt;&lt;&lt; If you use an amateur sandblaster you are safe or you can use a commerical
&gt;size sandblaster if you are very careful and keep moving. I've sand blasted
&gt;several cars with never a warp anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;You don't hafta use 'sand&quot;, either...Get the right equipment and you can
&gt;use such esoteric media such as walnut shells or calcium carbonate...

I've heard good things about several of the alternative materials - 
especially the ones that wash away with water. Not that i would rinse a 
bare steel shell of a car with water.
