Hi all-

Last fall I decided I would take care of all of the little rusty dings on
my new '73.  So I ground to metal every ding and bubble I could find,
sprayed with &quot;Extend&quot; rust converter any rust I couldn't get at, and primed
with Rustoleum.  Now a few months later I am seeing rust pop out in many of
the spots I &quot;fixed.&quot;

So I'm going to take him into a real body shop and have them do it the
right way (I was going to have them paint anyways, so I'm not too bothered
by contracting out a little extra work.)  

But I haven't given up completely on doing some of my own body work!  I'd
like to take care of the interior myself.  After reading the archives, I
find that rust converters are not a good long term solution, and that I
should have used a epoxy based primer that would etch and bond with the
metal.  But, after searching the archives and the web, the only epoxy based
primers I can find require a special spray gun.

Does anyone know of an epoxy primer that doesn't? And what goes on top of
it that doesn't require special equipment to apply?  In the end I'm not
looking for a beautiful finish; just something that won't rust and won't
chip when I walk on it or throw my sailing gear in.

Thanks for your help, now and in the past; this list has been a great
resource over the last 6 months.
