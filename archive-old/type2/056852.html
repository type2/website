Subject: floors

I'm looking at the floor between the front seats and I know that the thick
rubber mat that goes there is available, but what do I plug the holes (that
look factory) with?  What about holes in the floor in the main cargo area?
Original and drilled by PO?  Screws with silicone?  RTV only?  I'm planning
on using 3/8&quot; chip board painted with outdoor paint as the subfloor then
maybe a 5/8&quot; med to high quality plywood on that, don't know if I should use
old shag rug on that, new auto carpet, or lino.  opinions?
thanks
