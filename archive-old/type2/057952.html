Subject: Administrivia - remove me from list plz

[...]
Volks,

I went one step better...  not only gone, but banned.  Please, please,
PLEASE, don't post things like this!  *Both* of my addresses, this one and
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net are in the charter so that you can feel free to write me
with any question or problem you may be having or (especially!) that you
think the list might be having.  If you have been around since before I
took over from Ken (and you didn't save the charter re-post from Saturday)
then save these addresses if nothing else: 

dworkin_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net 

I am never gonna complain about answering questions off-list or handling
any subscription problems you may have, or telling you whether the list is
up or down, but if you try to subscribe or unsubscribe publicly or if 
you post an &quot;is the list up/down?&quot; message, that ends your association with 
the list! 

In addition, I feel I must remind everyone that the topic is 1968-&gt; air
cooled buses. It isn't splitties, it isn't convertibles.  For sale is not a
problem...I welcome for sale posts! (any year bus, but *busses only*)
Commercial vendors are not a problem, Ron and Jim have been around and
have advertised all sorts of goodies on this list, others would be welcome
*IF* they are advertising parts for air cooled buses from '68-&gt;.  Adverts
for non-bus parts are *off topic*!
