Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; Thanks all

Chris,

thanks for the reply. I finally got it done, with the help of lots of T2 
members.

I've been puzzled by all the references to getting the cylinders off. In my 
original message, I thought I made it clear that the pistons were in plain 
view, and that the problem was that the circlips/pins were inaccessible 
because the case was partially split, drawing the pistons down into the case 
bores. Finally, the case would not go back together to allow withdrawing the 
pistons far enough to reach the circlips.

I finally got some help and was able to manipulate three of the pistons out. 
The fourth required removing the rod cap bolts. It is odd that the crank 
woudn't turn (nothing visible blocking it, it's just that it would jump out 
of the half-journal in preference to turning. And when it was out, it 
wouldn't turn due to something locking it up.

Oh, well, lesson learned. Always remove the pistons before splitting the 
cases. It will be an easy job &quot;next time&quot; :-)

Cheers/Don
