&gt; &gt; This is the second time this week that that statement has been posted and
&gt; &gt; for the second time this week, I have serious heartburn over it.  I
&gt; &gt; disagree.  Respectfully, but strongly.
&gt;
&gt; I think maybe we are thinking the same thing but saying it differently,
&gt; but if you look on pg 72 of the Engine chapter of Bentley it shows the
&gt; timing settings and each of them are based on engine codes
&gt;
&gt; engine code             setting
&gt;   R                        0
&gt;   AE                       5 after
&gt;   CB single carb           5 after
&gt;   CB dual carb /AW         10 after
&gt;   CD/AW(fi)/ED             5 after
&gt;   ED                       5 after
&gt;   GD                       7.5 before
&gt;
&gt; if you put the wrong dist on an engine you would still set the static
&gt; timing based on the engine installed.   now once engine is running you
&gt; would be best set it at best compromise to get sufficient advance.

Bob,

I am sorry to say that we are not thinking the same thing.  The engine
block codes have no effect on timing.  Any B or AE engine will run with
any T1 distributor, timed to the spec for that distributor.  Any CB, CD,
AW, ED, or GD block will run with any T4 distributor. T4 engines will also
run, tho less well, with any T1 distributor.  The only caveat to each of
these statements is that the timing *must* be set to the spec for the
distributor.

Yes, Bentley mentions engine codes because Bentley was written for factory
new '68-'79 buses.  We don't own factory new buses.  There are no factory
new '68-'79 buses and have not been for 23 years.  Even if I ran across a
bus in a warehouse that had been stored since new, I would pull the
distributor and have a look at its code.

At this remove, any dist can be and has been found on any engine.  If you
lay out a statement that block code matters, then you have to take
responsibility for the poor new VW bus owner who reads your post in the
archives, mis-times his engine to the block code, and fries it.  To tell
him afterward, &quot;Well... you had the wrong distributor&quot; is not a help to
him.

&gt; we are saying the same thing, but the amount of advance and initial static
&gt; timing are based on the engine not what dizzy is in there....I have a GD
&gt; block with FI, even if I put a dizzy in there from an AW block I would
&gt; still set the initial static timing at 7.5 before rather than 10 after
&gt; TDC.  once the engine is running then I would use my timing light to get
&gt; the best operation

Bob,

This is true.  To get any VW engine started initially, the safest course
of action is to time it statically to 7.5 BTDC.  After it starts and after
you have checked the dwell, however, it must be timed to the spec for the
distributor, using a timing light, at proper RPM, with hoses connected or
not, as listed in the distributor specifications on Jim Thomson's page.


&gt; I think we are saying the same thing, AFTER you get the engine running and
&gt; check and verify and adjust with a timing light,  especially my opinion is
&gt; that a type IV engine cannot be properly timed without a timing light to
&gt; check both start timing and proper ADVANCE for that BLOCK

We agree up to the last word.  Substitute &quot;distributor&quot; and I am with you.

&gt; &gt; lucky, your severely oveheated engine would die on you around Salem,
&gt; &gt; VA, so that you could have it towed to Mark Deering's shop to have the
&gt; &gt; engine rebuilt.

&gt; and the moral of the story, make dern sure you have a temp guage and a
&gt; timing light!!

No, Bob.  The moral of the story is that if you time to the block, not the
distributor, it can cause you to severely overheat the engine.
