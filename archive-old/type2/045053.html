Subject: [T2] mechanic needed, bay area, San Francisco

Ive been taking my 75 FI to someone for a little while now, and its sort of 
a long drive to get it up there to him, i just need someone closer to san 
fran to take a look at it.

It was running great until I took it up to seattle, and once I hit the rain, 
it started idling really low, and now it just wants to kill if im not 
stepping on the gas. it will always start up again fine, and its going back 
to doing this wierd bucking thing again to when im at low rpm's, which ive 
heard could be anything at this point...

any local mechanics I can see in my area?

thanks

(damn, I need my own garage space, but in this city who can afford?)
