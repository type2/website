Subject: More body work quaetions

Hi all
I have all the materials to begin my body work on the
cargo floor. I have also decided to goaround to all the 
surface rust on the exterior and remove it and prime. Here
is my question. If I did all the exterior body work and 
primed the whole vehicle, should this significantly reduce
the price of a paint job. Also, would it be worth the price
reduction considering my lack of experience and that I will
be using canned primer?
My van has some hail damage on the roof. Probobly about
20 pings. Can I fill these with bondo and sand them off or
do they need cut out and replaced?

BTW I revieved my new door seals so I went out and began to 
slowley and carfully remove my old ones. They don't appear to
have agroovr to hold them in. Are these held in with adhesive
and if so what kind? Thanks to all for their help....
Remember, Smile, winter is just around the corner :)
