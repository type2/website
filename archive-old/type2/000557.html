&gt; Next, the O-rings and head pan gaskets come in a full set from any VW
&gt; dealership.


There is more than one quality level of pushrod tube seals (o-rings).  A
bargain-basement set runs about $5 complete, but you'll be pulling out your
pushrod tubes more often than you'd like to.  I sell a complete set made of
Viton(R) which is much more wear resistant, for $14.95.  Considering the
pain-in-the-a** factor of changing these, it's worth springing for the extra
few bucks.
