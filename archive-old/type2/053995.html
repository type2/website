JC whitney sells the same thing for approximately $25.00 without the
oxygen sensor, you can get a generic 3 wire sensor for not too much cash,
use the 3 wire itll be more accurate.

It will basiclaly tell you too rich, too lean or somewhere near the right
mix, no really specific or accurate info. Same with the CB, as they use
the same bosch style oxs.

take care,
