Subject: Re: [T2] way too injected!

Drew,

Gotta be one or more of several things.

The return fuel line is getting stopped up or the pressure 
   regulator closes and won't open...equals 125psi + on injectors
   and fuel ring.

The injectors are hanging full open or pressure is forcing them open...

The afm is sending a signal that says I am at WOT(wide open throttle)..and
the ecu believes it and starts opening the injectors a lot.

You really need to bite the bullet and go buy a &quot;real&quot; fuel pressure
gauge that you can hook up and look when it goes full rich.
Hi pressure when it dies means regulator getting stopped up or failing.

I suppose when this happens, you could pull the gas line between the
regulator and the gas tank, put this could be a serious high pressure
gas spill...and dangerous....

I had the opposite problem for a while from garbage in the tank, but one 
of the listees had my type problem from a gas line getting kinked when 
warm.....there's a thought.....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Friends,
&gt; I'm still trying get my &quot;78 Westy running well.
&gt; 
&gt; The fuel injection STILL goes full rich (fuel dripping out of the manifolds!)and 
stalls or won't start in the first place.  The new AVP motor runs well when it runs.  
I think I've checked everything as per the VW FI trouble shooting manual, 
but obviously I've missed something.
&gt; 
&gt; I just checked the head temp. sender again---3.5K ohms at slightly colder 
than normal temperature.  I disconnected the cold start valve by running the 
fuel line around it (no fuel to cold start valve).  
When cranking no fuel comes out the vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator.  
The flap on the air mass sensor seems free (I checked the resistance on the 
terminals of the air mass sensor previously--they seemed alright.  
I tried a different FI computer (thanks again Karl). 
That didn't help.  What in god's name is pumping all that fuel through the injectors on and off??????
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing which seems to help is disconnecting the 
computer and leaving it sit for a day or two.  
Then it usually starts right up and runs fine for a while.  
Lately it goes fine for 6-8 miles and goes full rich and dies.
&gt; 
&gt; The not so local VW guy and the very not so local VW dealer 
have gotten it to run for periods but not consistantly.  What am I missing here?
&gt; 
&gt; Any further help would be greatly appreciated as were the good leads I've already gotten from the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Drew
