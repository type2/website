Subject: fuel pump
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 72 Bus and it runs great.  It has an electric fuel pump.  When you 
turn the key to the on position you can hear it clicking and I think thats 
normal.  The bus starts fine. But sometimes like right now the clicking stops 
and the engine turns but won't start.  Maybe a loose wire?  I don' t know.  
Someone help. Please.  This is the second time its done it to me.

Thank You
Jon
