This is not an uncommon failure.  It usually happens because a &quot;hook&quot; at the
end of the throttle spring wears thin where it contacts the throttle arm or
the spring anchor.

If you look at these 2 places on an older carburetor you'll often find the
spring has actually worn little notches in the steel fittings.

Usually when the spring breaks you can manipulate the gas pedal with your
toe to reduce engine speed and get safely off the road.  Turning off the key
can be dicey, especially if you have a steering column lock
[it shouldn't lock up but there are always exceptions], but that may be the
only option to save the engine from over-revving and blowing.

If the spring is broken only at the hook, you can bend a new hook with a
pair of pliers and get on down the road.

The remedy is to check the spring for wear on a regular basis and carry a
spare spring in your tool kit.  Original throttle springs are still
available, but even a generic spring from a hardware store will get you
home.

Don't run any longer than necessary with a jury-rigged spring, as the added
tension of a non-stock spring will accelerate wear on the throttle shaft.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The little spring on the carburator had snapped in two!!! The throttle
on the carburator was wide open!!  &lt;&lt;
