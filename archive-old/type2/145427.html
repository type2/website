Subject: [T2]Testing a alternator OFF the bus???????

Called advance auto parts.....
   
  there computer wire doesnt fit the type2 bus??????76 transporter/riviera............???
   
  i figured i could just make them a wireing harness but they say that wont work when i call them....?
   
  the problem is they dont have a way they say to plug into the back of the alternator....?
   
  i am trying to find out if one i got in the mail is actually good or not...? the guy said he wasnt sure....?
  and of course i have no way of telling unless it is put on the bus and well eeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggg trying so hard to prevent that just to test it....
   
  i dont like changing the alternator.... but will if have to.... thought maybe a guru here had a trick and sure way to say if the alternator is good OFF the bus,.....???
   
  peace
  and vw grease
