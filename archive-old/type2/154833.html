Subject: Re: [T2] RV &amp; Marine Battery?

&gt; Or, you could just go to Sams/Costco and get a garden-variety deep-cycle 
&gt; RV/Marine battery or a pair of 6V Golf cart batteries (just don't put 
&gt; them inside the vehicle). 
&gt;

I went to Sears at Clackamas Town Center and the guy selling batteries had his Bay parked just around the corner from the entrance, they had a small, medium, and large, $72.00, $82.00, and $92.00

I was feeling quite average so I went with the medium, it filled the available space quite well, the large would have been too big in my opinion.

I think I will be OK.

Usually I research things for a very long time, in this case I didn't think that would be neccessary and ended up rushing myself because of other dependent projects, when this battery goes south I will be prepared.

Thank you,

JM
