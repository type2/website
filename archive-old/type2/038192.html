Subject: Re: The Perfect 2nd Car? 2CV

My brother has one for sale cheep!  He's owned several of them for years.  If 
interested, inquire at: pat_quilter_at_qscaudio_dot_com.  

&gt; &gt;&gt;Citroen 2CV
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Damn!  I'd love to have one.  Not practical, though.
&gt;  
&gt;  Why is it not practical? 4 doors, big sunroof (just think of the 
&gt; possibilities of loading it from the top ...), easily removed rear bench, 
&gt; seats four adults, top speed around 75 mph (of course not with 4 people 
...), 
&gt; engine can be changed even faster than in a VW, extremely simple to work on.
