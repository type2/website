&gt; Anyway back to the thread. Firstly, how feasable would it be to buy a

Well,

As to the used bus.  I'd buy one with a bad engine and buy a brand new
type1 engine to put in there. (factory new 0 mile engines optimized for
mexican gas are about $1200 or so. Turnkey with all acessories $1700))

Get a 71 if you can, it has the greatest similarities to busses in mexico
and thus the greatest availability of spare parts.  Drive it in so cal for
a couple of weeks, get the brakes gone through, the tranny checked out.

With proper preparation ther should be minimal surprises, but have a budge
to fix it if problems do arise, or learn mechanics and DIY... bring lots
of spares. Really, bus driving now takes money or knowledge... make sure
you have lots of one or the other. (or both is better, heheh)

Air conditioning is a relatively recent invention (nobody had it before
maybe the 50's in any great numbers.) I remeber stories my mom has told me
of her childhood and sitting by pans of ice with fans blowing over them to
keep cool in the summer.

People have WALKED from the united states to central america in the summer
with no airconditioning, so to whine about no ac in a car would be silly,
you are light years ahead of the people who walked in comfort level!

its all about pacing yourself, drinking plenty of water and finding
alternate methods to keep cool. (mist bottle sprayer, shade and insulation
over the roof, and my fave a bandana soaked in icewater draped around ones
neck or over ones head) In arid climates swamp coolers work
wonders... make one of those (or buy one) I am addicted to coffee, but
never drink it in the heat of the day. You'll have to drink practically an
extra gallon of water for every cup of coffee you consume. Other
caffeinated bevrages are probably a no-no as well... caffeine is a
diuretic and serves to dehydrate you.

The VW was designed for no AC and as such has excellent vents in the dash,
and the vent windows will blow you out of your seat practically... I
practically  need goggles when i crank my splitties vent windows fully
open ;) (though it doesnt have the dash vents..)

So, i have driven through texas in the middle of the summer with no ac, i
was comfortable enough, but YMMV, comfort and endurance is such a
subjective thing depending on who one is and how much one likes to whine.
( i will say 110 is damn hot, i shut the vent windows to avoid the blast
furnace in the face sensation and just soaked my shirt in icewater and put
it on my head.  No shirt, shorts, no shoes.  If you arent in the sun, the
more air can cross your skin the cooler you will be.  In the sun, wear
white or other LIGHT colors, long sleeve, very lightweight
fabrics.  Anything lighter colored than your skin will reflect light
better... and keep that light from heating you up, hehe.

So, i would say ac is an OPTIONAL creature comfort, if you want it and the
added complexity and reduced mileage that goes with it more power to you,
if you dont then great as well. But in no way shape or form can it be
considered a necessity as no-one had it 1940 and before, and they all got
along just fine without it.

A friend told me his grampa always said that AC was the beginning of the
downfall of modern civilization.  With how much its wussified everyone and
how its changed the way cars/buildings are made so that they cant be
ventilated properly without it, and the ozone thing, i think he just might
be right...

Steve,

Who lives in hot humid missouri and hasnt had automotive AC for 4+ years.

p.s. i have made it through a few saint louis summers with no home AC
either. In the 90's at night, practically 100% humididty a fan and no
sheet will keep you cool enough, but i admit to being wussified, since my
current abode has ac i do run it in the summer to make sleeping easier...
