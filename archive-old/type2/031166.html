&gt; I may become the laughing-stock for this one, but what about the old static 
&gt; timing light?
&gt; 
&gt; 
Static timing is just like setting the dwell with the point gap.  You do
static timing just so that the engine will start and then once you get the
engine going then you have to use a strobe to get it right.

Same as getting the points close with the feeler gauge and then using the
dwell meter to get it right.
