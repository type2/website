Subject: [T2] CO tuneup

well, my intermittent problems finally stopped.
 
I had replaced the AFM, ECU, wiring harness, etc.
As luck would have it, the van died just outside Bozeman, MT
on the way to Seattle from Iowa.  I spent a ton of time thinking
I had a leaky injector. (all you smart people already know
it was the head temp sensor)

I was fairly surprised to get good help at 2 enirely different shops.
The first place downtown suggested grounding the sensor wire to make
the engine run. The second place had the sensor in stock and let me put
it in whiloe I was parked in their driveway.

I'd like to readjust the mixture while I am in Seattle before I head home.
I'm going to put new injector seals in since I noticed mine were really shot
and I figured a little tuneup wouldn't hurt things.

are their shops in the area that can quickly adjust the mixture for cheap?
or can I do it myself based on sound and smell?

if it matters, I have a stock 77 with the 2L



take care all
