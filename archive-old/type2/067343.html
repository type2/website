I also have one of these welders and have done a LOT of welding on 
cars with it. When I got the gas for the MIG conversion the guy at 
the counter asked what I was using it with. So I told him, and he 
said &quot;oh, one of -those-.&quot; I didn't ask him what he meant though. 
I've been very happy with it.

I find that it is easier to weld with the flux-cored wire, but the 
MIG does a nicer job.

Oh yes, what do you mean by &quot;adjusting the nut holding the 
electrode&quot;? That part must be missing on mine. :-)
