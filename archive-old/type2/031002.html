&gt; Bad, bad scene there.  Of course all fuel lines themself are replaced as a

&gt; but the bigger lines are tough.  The ones down to and up from the bypass

I have found almost all of the lines from the folks that repair heavy
equipment hydralics and air systems.  pricy but VERY high quality.

call your friendly local neighborhood construction company, and find out
where they have their hoses repaired (they don't replace those buggers)
they also have repaired my A/C hoses when it was working


&gt; countoured lines is where it goes to hell, particularly the C shaped one

yeah I just have a bent hose in there

&gt; from decel to the intake S hose is NLA and not duplicated.  The big intake S
&gt; hose itself is usually getting cracked and is NLA though the fittings in it

fortunately mine is still good, but I always check in the Pic n Pull for
these one day I may luck out and find a good one.

&gt; is NLA, american replacement stuff can work but a lot of heater hose is not
&gt; up to taking hot oil vapor, some is got to hope, although unsightly I've

which is why I use hydralic lines

&gt; wondered if a good quality real Tygon (PVC) tubing might not be a good

I tried it and Gasoline degrades it, just enough gas fumes in there etc so
after a year or so it is so brittle that it will break when you touch it.

&gt; some sell.  As to routing, make sketches or whatever but in point of fact
&gt; not much confusion the big stuff fits together generally only one obvious
&gt; way and the only possible problem is recalling the correct routing and
&gt; hookup for the little 3.5mm stuff which varies depending on year.

one word,  Polaroids   I take polaroid photos before I take it apart

&gt; split tubes, but how hard would this one be) and personally I think even
&gt; something for the C tube and breather in like a hard correctly bent
&gt; thermoplastic with just short jumpers of fabric covered to hook to the

I would buy em in a heartbeat
