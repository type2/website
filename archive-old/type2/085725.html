Allrighty then Pat,

First, looks like you'd be refering to what is more comonly called a 
weekender.

Second of all a new block is a new block never had one in 18yrs of my sweat 
heart that's only a dream, yeah your giveing up some horse power and 
lowering major component costs your also lowering the reliability/durability 
factor, just baby her and don't be in as much of a hurry.  But you can rob 
bugs for a lot of engine parts, (LOL)

Third not knowing the price, paint job or other conditions it's hard to 
offer an oppinion.

Pop tops kick, But even I would prefer a '74 model because of the direction 
it pops. Giving up the ability to stand up while changing clothes verses 
being less drafty it's gona be your call.
