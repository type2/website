Subject: More deluxe projects FS

Well,

They're coming from everywhere at the moment.....

Project A.  61 23 window deluxe.  Lo-rust body, cut wheel wells, non-op
1500 motor, no sunroof mechanism, nose damage (owner has front end clip
with 'incorrect' round indicator lights - I think the old nose would be
repairable - it's not THAT bad). No interior (does have all seats), no
external trim, jailbars etc......

This would be a good long termer if you were in a position to wait and pick
up all the bits when they came up at the right price....Basic body is
better than a lot I've seen....asking price is $1500 (seems firm).....Mark
(415) 732-0573.....he's not a happy man ....his 'new' wife is making him
sell it (think you'd work some things out beforehand wouldn't you?).....bus
is in Mountain View area



Project B. 64 21 window.  Cooked 1776 motor.  Some rust in floors, belly
pans and skylight windows.  New brakes, good tyres, allegedly rebuilt trans
at some stage (but you can't drive it right?), walk-thru, bucket rear bench
seats, jail bars but no exterior trim, repairable nose damage........asking
price is $1500 but this one could go for much less, guy needs to move the
bus from where it is and needs some urgent cash....Eric (415) 202 6420
...bus is in Daly City area....
