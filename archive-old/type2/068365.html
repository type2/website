Subject: Mounting non-Westy propane tank

My Westy propane tank holds just over 2 gallons and lasts only about four 
days. So I'm considering over options...

I could just keep a small barbecue tank somewhere and fill the tank 
myself, mount another Westy tank underneath (presuming I could find one), 
or find a low-profile (horizontal) tank for RVs with much more capacity.

Does anyone have suggestions for finding/ mounting alternative propane 
tanks?
