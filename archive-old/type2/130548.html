I just put 87 in mine, unless I feel like the tank as been sitting 
around for &quot;too long&quot; from having not being driven for a while, or if I 
want to use up some starting-to-get-old gas from a can... then I'll 
fill up with 91.

I use 87 because I have not experienced any knocking / pinging problems 
with it, and my engine runs just dandy without spending the extra $$ on 
the higher grade fuel.
