Subject: [T2] VDO Oil Temp &amp; Oil Pressure Guage--- HELP

Just finished installing new 1600 DP  in a 71 bus *not mine*   the owner
fried the last engine.  I installed new VDO oil temp gauge, and  oil
pressure gauge, under the dash on the left side of the steering column.
Hooked everything up according to the diagramed instructions. EXCEPTION:
used a common ground on the back of the left front head light for
everything.  The oil pressure gauge works great!  The oil temp gauge ( with
a grounded dipstick sending unit) just pegs when I turn on the key.  Tried
running a separate wire to the sending unit thinking  I may have shorted out
the original wire under the bus.  Still pegs when key is turned on.  Checked
all the connections * on the (+ )side of the gauge the wire goes to the top
of the fuse on the ignition switch, the (S) side of the gauge is to the
sending unit, the (-) on the gauge is connected to the common ground on the
back of the headlight*  Do I need to have a DEDICATED ground for the oil
temp gauge to work properly?  Did I miss something?

TIA
