Subject: push rod wear

Hello!, I am rebuilding a 1978 type IV 1700.  When I pulled the push rod
tubes out I noticed that two of them displayed a shinny worn area about 3/8
of an inch long.  The two rods wear on cylinders that oppose each other.  Is
this normal for this engine?  Does this indicate a problem with the lifters
or the camshaft?  Can someone please advise me on this?  

Thanks, Brian
