Subject: Needed Relay (used)

Volks,

If anyone has one stashed, I could *really* use a used double relay, part #
133 919 431.  It fits various models of mid-late 70's VW 1600s, and is
mounted to the bottom of the fuse box.

BD has them _at_ $125, and the dealer has them for significantly more, but
frankly I don't have that much moolah at the moment.  If anyone has a lead,
or is willing to yank one from a boneyard, please contact me pmail.

Regards!
