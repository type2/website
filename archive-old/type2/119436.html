Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts - Copper Nuts are not copper!

After dwelling on this subject all day----
why not just use non-corroding, non seizing stainless--and get it over
with????
 I left here at 12PM-- just got back--and you guys are still hashing
this one over--

How many variables can their be?

Pleeease---!!!

 
E-mail message   
 
One additional thing to consider with regard to the nut material for
exhaust:If you use the copper nuts, and they get rounded or just plain
stuck, they are by far the easiest to get off using a chisel. 
The exhaust nuts vendors refer to as &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot; are not made
of copper - they are copper plated steel. They are quite hard, will not
round off at all. The are self-locking which is important as the torque
on these is quite low.
