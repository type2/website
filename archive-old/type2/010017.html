&gt; &gt; Also, my heater boxes are thrashed, so I want some suggestions.  The
&gt; &gt; cheapest I have found them is for roughly $200 a piece, but I am not
&gt; &gt; really in a position to buy them right now.  If someone knows a
cheaper
&gt; &gt; place to find them, that would be great

How thrashed is thrashed?  If they're just holey and loose on the
pipes you can do wonders by brazing patches on the holes and brazing a
&quot;split sleeve&quot; where the exhaust goes through the shell.  Not
particularly pretty, but they work as good as new!  If you don't have
the torch to do the brazing, you can make all the patches and take
them to a welder to install.  You might even be able to wire-weld the
patches in place, but I'm more used to brazing thin metal.
