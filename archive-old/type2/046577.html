&gt; can't get around here BUT
&gt; 
&gt; it arrived having been opened for inspection, had a big stamp on it saying
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;CERTIFICATION  this piece does not contain any parcels that match a
&gt; security profile jointly espablished by the FAA and USPS&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; their checking up on you, thought my heat shield was a bomb or something!!

Well, ain't that innerestin'? Monica didn't mention anyting amiss with
her shipment (Vanagon heat shield), so I guess just the bay heat shields
set off the USPS alarms! Weird....

Apparently, UPS plays basketball with their shipments -- heat exchanger
appendages have been reported protruding from boxes on delivery. Good
thing they're sturdy.
