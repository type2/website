Subject: Oil Gauge/Clock Problems

I have an oil gauge that has been disconnected and would like to hook
back up.  Can anyone give me some illustrations/directions on how to go
about this process.  I also have a clock that isn't working.  How can I
check to see that it's either the clock or the wiring.

Thanks for any help.

Dean
