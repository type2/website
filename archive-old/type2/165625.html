&gt; I picked up one of those adapters from Harbor Freight that allows you to

&gt; Not entirely safe for transport in some locals.  I believe that you can't
&gt; take a refilled disposable bottle through traffic tunnels here in the states
&gt; for instance.

Worse than that.  Just the act of refilling them is illegal.

That being said, the reason that it is illegal is that the disposable
bottles don't have a provision against overfilling.  If filled completely
full with liquid propane the expansion of the liquid in a hot bus could
rupture the bottle with disasterous results if an ignition source is
nearby.

So, if you refill, make sure that there is some &quot;slosh&quot; in the bottle when
you shake it.  If there isn't, hook it up and burn off a bit of propane
before you store the little bottle away in the bus.
