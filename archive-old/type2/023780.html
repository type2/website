Hi,

&gt; Got a tricky adjusting star, and have tried everything
&gt; I can think of, PB Blaster, banging it one way, then
&gt; the other, heat, torquing in the adjusting screw to
&gt; try and force it out.

 Hmm,  have you considered writing it off and replacing
the backing plate? It might seem a bit drastic but I
think the socket that the star is stuck in might give
you trouble again quite soon, even if you do get it 
loose this time.
 Depends what the rest of the plate is like, of course:
I got fed up with my stars sticking up between 
adjustments but the plates were rough and the adjusting
holes flared out from previous attempts so, when the
cylinders started sticking, replacement seemed the 
obvious solution. In retrospect I should have done it
much sooner and saved myself a lot of grief.

 Just a thought.

Cheers,
	W.
