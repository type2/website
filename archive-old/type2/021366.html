Terry:
I'd be shocked and surprised if they even had the equipment and knowledge to do
the complete job, especially R&amp;R the guides and seat the valves.
If you can get it done within those flat rate numbers and have confidence in the
work, all I'd ask is &quot; does that include the tip?&quot;
SERIOUSLY. Figure on tipping the mechanic if he does a good job.
I used to work in an automotive machine shop. There was a guy that would bring
his stuff in and hand the chief machinist a twenty or a fifty. He got WAY more
value for his tip than it cost him. His work as always done before the promise
date, and he always got extra special work for no extra charge.
Stinginess is not economy. Generosity pays!
