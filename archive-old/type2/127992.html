Subject: re: location of 71 Weekender for sale

Sorry, folks. Losing my engine yesterday, the walk home, and the decision to sell my much loved bus has got me pretty scattered. I'm in western North Carolina between Hickory and Asheville. Morganton, NC.
 
The bus has surface rust in some places that can be repaired. The corner where the battery sits has rusted thru, but could be fixed. Still plenty of metal there. It needs a headliner and paint job.....and of course an engine. Tires, brakes, seats, table, cabinets, dash/instruments/steering wheel, glass all good.
