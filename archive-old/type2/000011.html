Hey Karl,
of interest to me (and possibly others) is what exact components you need and 
from what vans/golfs/etc. will work in the pancake bus??  Ign. module? coils? 
stuff like that.  and then also where can we find the info on the advance 
curves or is that done from your own research??

curious and thrilled to find a *stock* vw electronic ignition system...
