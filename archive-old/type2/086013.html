FWIW -

HP is is a (loosely) calculated figure based on Torque _at_ RPM, the formula 
being:

HP = Torque * RPM / 5252

A dyno will measure torque and RPM, the rest is math. You will notice that 
on any Torque/HP chart, the two will meet at... 5252 RPM (HP = Torque * 5252 
/ 5252)!

There are some ambient factors such as temperature and humidity, etc.. that 
will factor in, but not to a great degree.

Unless I err...
