Subject: Direct wiring an engine for testing/ '72 to '74 compatability
Message-ID: &lt;375420D0.BAE_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

So, I might be able to pick up a '72 Bus real cheap.  It's only got
60,000 miles on the engine.  The PO blew some fuses and decided to
replase them with nails, well a fire was the ultimate result.  Burned up
a lot of the wiring. The engine turns over using the key, but there is
no spark at the coil. 
	It's definately fixable, but what I need to know is how can I wire this
thing up so I can get it started and warmed up to yeild some reliable
compression test results?  I'll be using the 1700cc in my '74 Westy
provided the compression is ok.
	Which brings me to my next question.  Am I going to run into any
problems putting a 1700 in my '74?  The input shaft is the same length
right?  The throwout bearing should be the same also.  I may end up
swaping both the tranny and engine just to be safe.  Since I'm not to
sure about the tranny in my '74.  What do you think?

Thanks,
