Subject: Selling one of my Westies (82 diesel)

Hi All,

Selling this sweet sounding diesel.  It's been under
cover or garaged most of its life.  Paint is still
shiny and interior original and excellent.  See my ad
on &lt;www.westfalia_dot_org&gt;.  Look under classified,
vanagon, Virginia to read history and see picture. 
Thanks.

Rob
