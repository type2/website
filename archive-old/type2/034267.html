Subject: x-mas special: seats for sale cheap in NC

Cross posting because I am told these will fit in a split with some coaxing.

I have the 2/3 middle and a full rear seat out of the '72 that I would like
to move fast! The seats are black factory upholstery and are in pretty good
shape. You will have to provide you own hold down clamps. The have been in
the basement for most of this year and I need to move them to make room to
store the '67 interior while it goes under the knife.

The seats are located in Greensboro, NC and I will not refuse any reasonable
offer. The first person to show up at the house with some cash takes them
away:)
