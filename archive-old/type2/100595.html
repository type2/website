You have to see this to believe it!

Collected for about 20+ years worth of VW stuff, then passed away. 

67 complete vehicles, 14 shells, about 11 frame pans, 150++ wheels and
tires, 

15 engines found, 10 transaxles, etc. etc. etc...

Just a quick run down. About 30 Bugs, 15 Busses (2 campers -not pop tops),

1.	'59 Chevy bel-air front clip, and parts everywhere in vehicles, on

This would be a great wrecking yard business to start, or a lot of
restorables out there. Hidden treasures everywhere. Vehicles are in various
stages from complete to just a shell. Some need just engines while others
need everything with a perfect body to start with. Don't let this pass you
by. Lots of treasures.
