Subject: RE: [T2] Altitude adjustments?

&gt;From: Don Tuleja

&gt;What, exactly, do I need to do to my 73 with dual PDSITs on Sunday
&gt;when I start hitting 5000+ feet of altitude?

&gt;I hear re-jetting, but that's not really a side of the road thing. What 
&gt;else?

Since you are on the cost now it would be a great time to rent or buy a 
scuba tank and take some Oxygen with you. Run a small diameter line into one 
of the vacuum lines and......

I am just kidding, it might work but it might explode. :-)
