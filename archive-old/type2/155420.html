Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 location

Mark, do all the 700's have a light on them? Mine is quite old, and I can't recall seeing any light?
Thanks
Courtney


Be sure to mount it so that you can see the led  
&gt; lite. makes 
&gt; it easier when trouble shooting.  I had a guy call me broke  down 
&gt; and he was 
&gt; able to see the lite so I knew the unit had current. turned out  
&gt; it was his 
&gt; coil.  later  Mark dearing
