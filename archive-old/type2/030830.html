All,
	I have been trying to get my '73 bus tuned.  I have dual carbs on
this fat daddy which makes it even more interesting.  It starts up an
seems to run strong, but very exhausty.  When I pull the spark plug wires
from the distributor cap one at a time, there is a noticable decrease in
rpm, except in the number one cylinder.  Removing the spark plug wire from
that cylinder makes no difference in rpm.  When I pulled the wire and
tested it I got a fat blue spark from the wire to ground.  The spark plug
looks fine, although it has a little black soot on it and is covered with
gas.  What I am concerned about is could a spark plug look ok but not
carry a spark?  Also what braands of spark plugs would you recommend?
Maybe I screwed up the wiring or something, heres how the dist cap is
wired.
