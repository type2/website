Subject: Re: [T2] dial indicator - end play

I'm quite happy with the &quot;made in China&quot; dial indicator and magnetic base I
got from Harbor Freight. It has a large face and considerable travel. Very
inexpensive. Also have an old Starrett with much smaller face and less
travel but a better clamp which is handy on non-magnetic aluminum motors.
0.001 precision is fine for end play.

Phil

&gt; I've been looking at dial indicators to set the endplay. &gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate it if someone had a recommendation for the range and
accuracy. It seems most gauges are .001 precision but that will mean the
needle won't move much checking the endplay. Is more precision desireable?
