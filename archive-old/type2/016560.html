Subject: Request for Riviera photos

Lately there has been a fair amount of conversation about ASI Rivieras.  I
would like to enlarge the Riviera section of
http://members.tripod/~wetwesties/riviera/ with a BUNCH more Riviera photos. 
So, if you have pictures of your (or anybody's) Riviera, could you please send
them on to me (with or without commentary) and I'll put 'em up.

TIA
