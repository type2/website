&gt; &gt;Stock pulleys vary as to timing notches -- but I think 3 of them
&gt; &gt;should be 7.5, 5, 0, reading clockwise.
&gt;

         There isn't any difference in how they read, but just that some
pulleys have 3 notches, some 2, and some one. The ones with 3 all read the
same way   Again: reading clockwise (the way the hands on a clock move) the
first, or left-most notch is 7.5 BTDC


&gt;
&gt; Reading clockwise (or left to right) directly from the pulley in the above
&gt; order would indicate 7.5 (ATDC), 5 (ATDC), 0 (TDC).
&gt;

        Don't know how you get this. Any ATDC notches would have to be over to
the right of the 0 notch ( the furthest right, or #3 as you move clockwise.

&gt;
&gt; I thought the way you stated it was confusing &amp; I tried to clarify.  It
&gt; was not meant as a flame (I used a couple of smileys for the humor
&gt; impaired).

      I'd have to say that your above statement probably confused many.
