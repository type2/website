&gt; If you decide to go with the KYB shocks, a lot of people use the Gas-Adjusts
&gt; on the rear and the KYB GR-2 on the front. I actually used the Gas-Adjusts
&gt; front and rear and love them. A big improvement!!!
&gt; 
&gt; The Gas-Adjusts are a stiffer shock, but I like them on the front. Of course
&gt; I don't know what the bus would feel like with the GR-2's but I am happy.

I had to remove my front gas-a-justs; the roads here aren't perfectly smooth
and I got tiring or feeling every bump.

I recently rode in an original 72 Westy with original shocks that are still
working and the ride was extremely pleasant. After a couple of years driving
with the gas filled shocks I feel the oil filled ones are more appropriate
for a bus.

The real problem is that the selection of shocks is extremely limited.
