Subject: RE: Still No Spark !

I know this may seem very trivial, but have you checked the voltage comming
from your battery?
I too have a 73 Bus. When I FIRST got it, I was able to turn the headlights
on, the radio, everything... except the car wouldn't start. I took the
battery out, charged it, and added a little bit more alkaline and water. The
battery worked even better. The lights were bright (just as I would expect a
fresh battery to be), the radio turned on, everything. But the car still
wouldn't start. The next day, I went out to the car, and the battery was
nearly dead. I went to Sears, bought a BRAND NEW battery (using the
suggestion from their computer). The battery ended up being the same as the
one I had originally (just new). I installed it, the bus Fired RIGHT up.  It
might be worth it just to test.

Also, if you want to make absolute sure that everything is hooked up
properly, try hooking your battery up DIRECTLY to your ignition coil.
(thereby bypassing the ignition). This will be a good test to make sure
you're getting the full voltage and starting amps. 

Get the battery tested. If the starting amps are low, or the battery isn't
holding a GOOD charge, then replace it. If that doesn't fix the problem,
then try hooking the coil up directly like I said. That will let you know if
it's a problem with your ignition.
