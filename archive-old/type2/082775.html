Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent Repair

For a fairly quick and easy fix, try one of those iron-on denim patches that 
your mother used to patch the hole in your jeans.  Have someone hold a board 
wrapped in a towel on one side while you iron it from the other side so you can 
apply addequate pressure without pushing the iron through the canvas.
