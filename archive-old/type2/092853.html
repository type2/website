Subject: RE: [T2] looking for a used dual carb linkage

Yes and if you look around you'll find it in the Beetle section too.

There is a picture there someplace. My browser did not show a pic.

It is stainless steel with nice ball and socket joints.

You could make your own if you new the math to figure the lever lengths.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;im looking to buy a linkage kit, complete or not, used, for dual dellorto
&gt; &gt;drla 40 on  a type 4 engine
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Else, anyone can point me out the right kit on CB performance?  its seems
&gt; &gt;they have many kits, offset intake manifold or not... well all intake
&gt; &gt;manifold on type 4 are offset no? the passenger side is closer from the
&gt;back
&gt; &gt;in about 1-2 inches.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I bought their linkage way back in 1995 and it is wonderful. I used it for
&gt;36mm Dells on a Type IV in a Beetle.
&gt;
&gt;I am told that this is a copy of the Type III carb linkage.
&gt;
&gt;Take a look at the VW part, maybe it will be perfect.
&gt;
&gt;Much of the aftermarket stuff is pretty flexy I am told.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ciao!
