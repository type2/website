Subject: re: 87 octane? not what i heard

hey now,

i've been running 93 ammocco premium since the rebuild of rumba. sean, the
fellow who rebuild my engine, strongly suggests using premium on the rebuilt
engine. i've noticed better gas milage and increased power since using premium.
guess i'll try the lower octane just to see how it does. i think richard palmer
swears by the high octane as well...
