I received hitch installation instructions from hitch-web for the dalan
DA217399~T1693 _at_ $142.11.  (PDF - if you're interested in seeing them,
email me and I'll send it to ya.)  They say you must drill a hole in the
bottom of the bumper.  Grr.

My bumper has a little black painted guard on it that appears to be
attached with standoff kinda thingies, hides the rusty tailpipes... 
Hate to remove it.

Found this on ebay:

Still a problem with the guard, but would something like this even
work?  I'm talking a total weight of less than 600-700 lbs, trailer and
gear...
