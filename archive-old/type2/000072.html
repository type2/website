&gt;  The engine is a 1600 dual port, the last refinement of the venerable
&gt;  type 1 engine.  It's a good engine, puts out 50 horsepower or so, and
&gt;  will push the bus along at a comfortable 60 mph.  I've had my '71 up to
&gt;  75, but it is much more happy and comfortable to drive at 60 or 62. 
&gt;  (these are true MPH figures, BTW.)

No, you are  forgetting that VW Mexico is still making Type 1 engines and are 
now using a multi point Fuel injection system resulting in 64HP output.

When I picked my Van up last year within 3 hours I had loaded up 400 square 
feet of exhibition stands, and 4 tyres I was selling and set off for VANFEST 
(the UK VW vans show) I was cruising at 60mph pulled out to over take, looked 
at the speedo and it was reading 80mph and my foot was NOT on the floor. [NB. 
this speed was due to my lack of familiarity with the new engine - I don't 
drive my bus that fast normaly]

The 1600 type 1 has moved a bit since the 1970s. Even coming equiped with a 
catalytic converter system that will meet emmissions requirements anywhere in 
the world

So when you good folk buy your new Mexican Type 1 engines don't forget to 
order the FI trimmings too and you will be pleasently supprised
