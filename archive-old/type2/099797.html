It will only be &quot;prone to overheating&quot; relative to it's increase in displacement.

&gt;  The stroke was increased,
&gt;ie, so longer rods were used, and his point relates not so much to the size
&gt;of the bearings as that they can egg out more from the action of the crank.

&quot;Egg out&quot; more?  I would love to hear the scientific explanation for that.  
In general, the bore/stroke ratio in a 2-liter is still larger than most other engines.  The 1800 is ridiculously oversquare.  Let's see... 

Engine      Bore/Str   Ratio

VW 1800:     93/66      1.41
VW 2000:     94/71      1.32 
302 Ford:    4/3        1.33
Subaru 2.5:  3.92/3.11  1.26
VW 1600:     85.5/69    1.24
350 Chevy:   4/3.48     1.15
351 Ford:    4/3.5      1.14
Honda 1500   75/84.5    0.89
  
As you can see, the increase in stroke is not extreme.  In fact, the 2000 engine still has a much larger bore/stroke ratio than a 1600 type1 engine.  Does Jon think the 1600 is prone to overheating too?

Also consider that VW used the 1800 engine for only two years but they stuck with the 2000 for 7.5 years.  Maybe they knew something that Jon didn't?  :)

&gt;Yes, I got 240,000 mi so far on my 78, but I drive with prudence (shift down
&gt;rather than drive it floored too long; change the oil, etc), but have heard
&gt;enough stories about overheated engines, dropped valves, etc on the later
&gt;engines.

I've seen a lot more 1.7/1.8 engines in the yards with dead motors than 2-liters.  Here's another idea - less displacement means less power so you have to use more throttle or rpm to go the same speed, which generates more heat.  Point being that there is no free lunch by going down in displacement.  There are many other factors to take into account.

&gt;  75 is unusual in that it was the first to go to fuel injection,
&gt;and the last of the more conservative bottom end.   (Not sure what 76 was).

76 was 2.0, FI, solid-lifter.  A very good engine.  I've had many years with the 1.8 and many years with the 2.0 and I will never go back to the smaller engine.
