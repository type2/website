Hi,

Just got those new OEM Pagid brake shoes from the Busdepot and tried to
install them on my '75 bus yesterday. I found that the old shoes were
probably aftermarket and that the brake lever for the parking brake cable
cannot be easily removed. Even if I did remove it (by drilling out the
rivet), I wouldn't have the anchor pin and horseshoe clip necessary to
attach the lever to the new shoe (see Figure 8-6 page 26 of &quot;Brakes and
Wheels&quot; in Bentley). Would a regular bolt and a self-locking nut work
instead? Or would anyone have a set of that small, yet crucial hardware to
spare?

Danke im voraus,

Sami
