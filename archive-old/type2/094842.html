Subject: Re: [T2] bus painting (hippy style) question

I used Lowe's oil-based house paint on my previous bus ('75 &quot;Priscilla&quot;, may 
she rest in peace). Didn't sand first, didn't use primer. Just put it on 
with a brush (and it sure was a head-turner when completed, I must say). 
Went through two Northeast Ohio winters (salt, cinder and all) with 
absolutely NO wear whatsoever. Only drawback is it takes a couple of really 
hot days to dry rock-solid. I'm planning on using the same stuff on my 
current bus, as soon as I get her back on the road. I may try a coat of 
spray-on polyurethane this time around, just to give it some extra shine.

Later...

Sean,

1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
