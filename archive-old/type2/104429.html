Subject: Re: [T2] re:half shaft bolt and washer question

&gt; &gt;Sorry as I am reading Bentley I see that the plates I was talking about
&gt; &gt;are spacers and it says I should have six per axle. I only had two on each
&gt; &gt;CV or four per axle on my bus. Do I need to get the third for each CV?
&gt;
&gt; Yes!!  They are there for a reason.

Im sure they are but
some time ago I got boots that the double spacer didnt work on.
So I left them off.
No ill effect. Many thousands of miles later these boots are still good.
Now I would have preferred to use them and kept watch on them for awhile
and I wouldnt advocate just leaving them off.
