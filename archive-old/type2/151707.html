Subject: Re: [T2] advice on running hot.

Steve,

My 78 runs lots lower on oil temps, but the bumper and rear are awesomely 
hot.

30 minute run on the interstate at 75-80 and I can't even touch the 
bumper, while oil temps are about 210F

hmmm, just thinking about it, I wonder if a little wing up on the top side 
might help that....not enough to look ugly or bizarre, but just enough for 
a little air direct downward.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have been fighting what I think is an overheating problem in my van I will
&gt; give you a brief history.
&gt; 
&gt; So any advice please, also can you after driving for longer than 30mins feel
&gt; the rear valance and bumper and see how hot it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
