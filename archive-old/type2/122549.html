Subject: Re: [T2] Original Fuel Line Clamp removal

&gt; Hello Guys and Gals,
&gt; I seem to have a few clamps that resemble a spade or a diamond or even a
&gt; heart shaped top.  The camp appears to be solid.
&gt; I have mangled two now in getting  the fuel lines replaced.
&gt; Any helpful hints to removing these before I hurt something?

I am guessing you have a bus with an upright engine and single central carb?

If they are the original crimped metal hose clamps, you have to cut them off
to remove them. We sell correct original replacements for use on 5 x 3mm
fuel hose. We also sell similar clamps for use with high pressure 7 x 3mm
fuel hose used on fuel injected motors. The latter are not the original
clamps (which were screw type), but they work flawlessly.

I believe the 'crimped on' clamps are the best, bar none, especially on an
upright motor. They never leak and they look original. They do not damage
the hose, and they last forever. The down side is that they are single-use,
if you need to remove them, they have to be destroyed, but this is worth it,
IMO.
