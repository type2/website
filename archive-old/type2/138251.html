Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Richard,

How is pedal effort compared to a stock '68-'70 with drum brakes?  I
know that some of the euro busses came with disk brakes and no
booster.  I wonder if having the non-functional booster in the system
would greatly increase the effort required to stop the bus?  Anyone
out there with disk brakes and no booster care to comment?

I ask because I am in the process of upgrading my '69 to disk brakes,
and I am not planning to use the booster.  My feeling is that the bus
won't be any harder to stop than it is now, and I don't have a problem
with the level of effort now.

Thanks.

-Josh

&gt; Before eliminating the power brake system, take a drive in another bus,
&gt; coast it with the clutch, put it in neutral, cut the engine and try to stop
&gt; it with the brakes. You'll be horrified how hard it is without the booster.
