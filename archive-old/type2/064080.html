OK, Duncan, I hope you saved my post so you can look back and see that I did
*not* accuse you of infidelity. It was MY virtue that I was commenting on, not
yours. I simply said that *I* would give someone a ride who brought me along a
date. I don't know what a date means to you, but I don't expect to have an
adulterous relationship with someone to whom I was just introduced that would
endanger the &quot;monogamous&quot; relationship I might have with someone else.
Obviously, that was the first thing that entered your mind. For your the sake of
your monogamous relationship I hope the rider you (might) get isn't the opposite
sex, since sex will be the first (and probably only) thing you will be able to
think about. Haven't you ever had a date where you just sit next to someone and
just chat? Maybe split the bill? Ever shared a joke and had a good laugh
together (probably not)? Sex never entered this thread until *you* brought it
up.
As for my &quot;big bad type 2 friends,&quot; Pat simply got to the mailbox before I did.
As you can see, I don't need help defending myself, and I can take it just as
well as I can dish it out. He simply responded before I was able to, since I
usually don't get to my mail until the evenings. But I do appreciate a fellow VW
owner lending a hand without even being asked. BTW, thank you, Pat.
As for insulting you, dear SDuncanN, I had no intention of doing so in my
original post (but the gates are open now), and I'm sorry you felt insulted by
my feeble attempt at humor. That's why I put the winking smiley      ;-)
after my comment. That's computer-keyboardese for &quot;just kidding.&quot; That way even
people without a sense of humor can tell it's a joke. Even when it's not Friday.
Obviously, you lack security in your relationship, as you feel that simply
sharing a ride with a member of the opposite sex would automatically make you an
adulterer. You also spend too much time thinking about sex. You should try going
out on a date without the primary objective being intercourse. I hate to think
of what you do on &quot;double dates.&quot; Or a &quot;date with the guys to blay ball.&quot;

Good luck getting a ride!
