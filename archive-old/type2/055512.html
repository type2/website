Subject: Re: working on your van under difficult conditions

I was living in rural Maine and it had just snowed about 18 inches. The 
plows had gone through for their final clearing passes, but had not yet 
done the wide passes that cream everybody's mailboxes. I carved an 
equivalent opening from my driveway (in Maine it's called a yard, but for 
the rest of you, the driveway). Then I went out to do an errand in a 
pickup truck (okay, but for one or two details, it could have been a 
bus). This truck had been modified by the PO with a stick shift on the 
floor to replace the column shift. I had doubts about how well it was 
done, especially since the column shift was still there. But it worked.

Coming back from the errand, I jockied to make the widest possible right 
turn into the driveway. But the narrowness of the road-and-driveway was 
too severe. I was going to have to back up and try again. So I backed up 
and lined up, then shifted into second. That went okay, except the shift 
lever didn't bother to take me out of reverse. So I was in second and 
reverse at the same time (or something of the sort). Now I'm straddling 
the whole road and the truck is immovable. It can't be rolled AT ALL. The 
only thing to do is to get under it and remove the drive shaft. 

AND FAST because the plow will be coming back to cream my mailbox any 
minute. Add to this a couple of blind curves, temps dropping below 0, and 
a pulse rate that's shooting through the stratosphere.

Had I had a bus, none of this would have happened, right?
