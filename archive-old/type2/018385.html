Ok... here is the deal..  I just got the keys for my 71 bus today
(campmobile) and I have started it before, and one of my friends that
was going to buy it before drove it around...  no problem before..  I
went to start it up today (plenty of gas, plenty of oil, plugs all in
place) and no go.....it sounds like it wants to turn over sooo bad but
it won't, the belt is turning, so is the generator and the big wheel
under it...excuse me for my stupidity... or is it... newbieness??
anyways...   I just put a new battery in today and all the lights and
stuff work and all the electrical stuff works, just no running engine...

I don't know if humidity had anything to do with it...it rained like
hell for about 15 minutes (couldn't see....traffic on the interstate was
stopped)  and then let up to the point that we could slip the battery
in.... it wasn't flooded...we kept trying to start it for a span of
about 2 hours.... no go... whats going on here???

What is the little knob that sticks out under the drivers seat for??
not the seat adjustment knobs...but the other one... it pulls
out....sorta... then springs right back in...

help me!!
thanks!
