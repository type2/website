Hello,

I have a 72 1700cc camper with a Weber progressive carburetor. The van also
has a 009 distributor. Thanks to all who have made it clear that this
distributor is inadequate. I would like to go to the stock distributor. It
was suggested that I tap a vacuum port into the manifold in order to get
vacuum for the distributor, but I was wondering if I can &quot;T&quot; into the
manifold vacuum port that already exists for the brake servo. If so, any
advice as to how to best do this would be appreciated.

Thanks

Rich Patano
