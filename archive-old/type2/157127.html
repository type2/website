Subject: Re: [T2] let's take to the air!

When I was in junior high, many, many years ago, a friend of mine and  his dad built an airplane with a VW motor in it.  I don't know for  sure, but I'd bet it was a pancake.  I ran into him at our 25th  high school reunion and he said that he still has the plane and  occasionally flies it.  Wonder if I could just strap some wings to  the Bopmobile?  Cheers....KR
