In cleaning out my carport I uncovered my old long side step for a 1974 (and
other bays) Type 2.  It is extruded aluminum, with cast-iron square mounts
that poke into the jacking points on a van.  Made by DPD Products (Dan P.
Dixon, in Fort Worth, TX) for VWoA; the dealers carried these.  My
mother-in-law bought this one for me, as she had trouble stepping up into a
van without help.

There's rust on the securing brackets, but it's otherwise apparently sound.
Just needs cleaning up.

It's here free for anybody who'll pay freight -- or drive by my place in
Nashville, Tennessee.
