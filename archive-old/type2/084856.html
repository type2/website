I've done exactly what you're talking about. I'll e-mail you with details.

&gt;Hi everyone.  the wife has a 75 bus and I have a 67 bug.  I am thinking about
&gt;a type 4 conversion for the bug and was wondering what the major difference
&gt;is between the 914 engine and the bus engine?  Besides about thirty horses!
&gt;If I were to find one for the bus can I still use the factory injection?
&gt;Thanks and does anyone know of a good type 1 email list
