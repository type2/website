Subject: Re: [T2] sick of points

Hello George  consider yourself lucky  I have seen just as many points fail 
as I have pertronix and all in all that has been too many. Even when you think 
you are getting the best they too can have problems. There was a big bad bunch 
of bosch points that had the white plastic rubbuing block that drove 
everybody that got them nuts, would run for 3 miles then quit and after setting would 
run again. Then theres the cheapos, mostly at your FLAPS  american made that 
were just junk. Now if you do run points the ones I use are made by Bosch part 
# 01 130 has the black and white lead wire these are the points that the 
Formula Vee guys use, they can't use eletronic ingnitions by the rules. I 
personaaly have some of my buses using points and the others I'm using the Crane 
systems which I think are way better than Pertronix or the compufires. Points will 
fail on you just like the eletronics can. Yes checking the dwell everytime you 
change the oil is a good thing. Knowing how to set the dwell and timing is 
also a good thing just in case you have to on the side of the road. Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va     PS  one of the subjects 
I'm doing at High Country this year will be on pionts and setting them
