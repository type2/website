Subject: Re: [T2] More FI questions/woes

I think that silver thing on the firewall on teh right side of the engine 
compartment is the voltage regualtor for the alternator.

The EGR is not necessary for the engine to run well. Locally the do no smog 
checks and my valve is toast so I removed it and added a block off plate. 
Engine runs fine without it.

I had several vacuum leaks (injector seals) and the EGR valve was leaking 
causing idle quality problems. Fixed these two items and all was well.
