Mark, listees

It sounds like your engine is suffering from a severe vibration to be able to loosen/shear the
flywheel and fan bolts. It is probably the type of vibration that you'd not really notice a
great deal and pick up on, becuase otherwise I assume you would have done :-)

So, a few things spring to mind: I assume it was just a top-end rebuild (or sides rebuild as
flat 4 engines are configured), so you didn't need to split the crankcase. Could the oil
passageways to the main bearing have been clogged, or clogged on something you inadvertently
dropped into it, leading to bearing break-up? Was the end-float within spec. and restored 
as-was using the shims that came out?

If the bottom end is okay, then I'd start looking closely at the rods and pistons. Maybe one of
the set was wrong, or not within tolerance? It would have to be pretty far out to cause a big
vibration though, I mean our flywheels don't fall off when a plug lead comes loose and it runs
on 3 cylinders, right?

Its a long-shot, but is the alternator/alternator bracket/belt all okay and not distorted, etc.
as maybe a tight/loose belt could cause the fan to pop off, then the repeated loss of fan or its
eccentric force caussed the flywheel to loosen? Was the clutch centred? Was it replaced in its
same position (again this is unlikely to cause serious vibration)?

You're right, its a funny problem but I'm not laughing because my engine is in 385 pieces in the
garage at the moment (and I may be posting the list again in the next few days!!!!!)

At the risk of confronting a lot of LOL-ing...

I rebuilt my '76 engine, using new rod bearings, new camshaft bearings, 
used pistons and jugs. As rebuilds go, it is not intended for more than 
10,000 miles. I want to replace the p&amp;cs and heads rather quickly and the 
bottom end in dues course (with a '78 and counterweighted crankshaft).

Anyway, I got the thing back in the bus and started my 20 min. break-in 
at 2000 rpm. The fan popped off after 10 min. It had sheared the dowel. I 
put it back on, torqued down the bolts, and tried again. It popped off 
again. I replaced the spring washers with locknuts. It popped off again. 
So back to spring washers, plus a healthy slather of locktite. Now all 
seemed well. I got it out on the road at within 0.1 mile off comes the 
fan. Damn! This time it sheared all three bolts and made a real mess of 
the hub. But worse, I discover that the flywheel was loose too! It was 
not turning with the shaft. More like a freewheel, you might say.

This, of course, is very disappointing. I _know_ I torqued the nuts to 
eighty pounds (with a bar torque wrench, 1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; adapter).

Does anybody know what I might be doing wrong?

Okay, start LOLing.
