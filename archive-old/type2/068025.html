Subject: Bus Fantasy (long!)

While we busily bustle ahead into the christmas season, falling
ever further into the reaches of small undercapitalized businessdom
I think back to my original purpose of starting this business and wonder
if I will &quot;ever&quot; see the fruition of my current personal &quot;bus fantasy&quot;.

1965 SingleCab Search and Rescue  &quot;Wrecker&quot;

Let me preface by saying I am paying off the local &quot;Concourse Nazi's&quot;
with the dregs of my vintage parts collection and everything removed
from the singlecab that is original is going to resurrect a similiar, but
better suited `Cab.

The wrecker will be used ONLY to retrieve and salvage our foreign
friends and as an occasional hay-ride vehicle...

The wrecker will be lengthened 58&quot; by replacing the longitudinals which
at one time existed (in much better shape) with the center sections from
a donor vehicle, plus new tophats and a new reinforced basment floor-pan.

A second set of Gull-wing basement doors will be added just aft of the
existing basement doors.

The bed area will get a 19&quot; section added down the middle to accomadate
the extended &quot;flat bed&quot; and to clearance the dual rear wheels. The upper
bed will most likely recieve the diamond-plate treatment as original bed
material most probably won't hold up under the constant loading and
un-loading of vehicles...

The engine is debatable, I've seen a nice turbo-diesel Rabbit motor fitted
into other &quot;splitties&quot;, as well as a pinto, but haven't decided which direction
to go as low-end and torque is an obvious requirement. Most likely we'll
look further into the diesel as I already have one, and in an almost guilty
fashion seem to lean towards keeping the &quot;wrecker&quot; as volkswagen as
possible.

Retention of the reduction gearboxes is a must as we'll need all the umpff
we can muster for hauling vehicles, but the front-end will be replaced with
a 71 ball joint front beam with brake booster and disks up front.

Hydraulics will be used for the winch(es) so's I'd though about perhaps
trying to include some type of power assisted steering ...dunno. Too deep
for my little brain at this point to contemplate. Electric winches are real
heavy drains to both storage batteries and alternator. I'd like to keep the
charging system as unloaded as possible.

The wrecker will be fitted with a small Onan 2.5k gennie, and will also
feature a compressor (for extracating those hard to remove nuts-n-bolts
often found on our search and rescue missions) and a small oxy-rig
for &quot;other things&quot;!

The Cab has Safari's now, which I plan to retain, a more comfortable
seating arrangement will be used (perhaps, Ackkk!, bucket seats) as
the thing pokes springs in my rear and starts hurting my back after
only a few miles of traveling..

I have a used set of Holmes wrecker lights which will have to be cut
down to fit on the roof of the cab, and a vintage 60's searchlight which
will find a place somewhere on the front.

Oh! I almost forgot the hanging fuzzy dice, and the chrome plated &quot;ladies&quot;
adorning my mud-flaps.....
