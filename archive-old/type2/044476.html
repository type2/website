denise sends:

&gt; almost got my friend's '71 (beautiful) camper running again, just need
&gt; to test the generator. any suggestions?. all i have is a voltmeter.

All the FLAPS in my area have free generator/alternator testing. Go get the
generator tested there and buy a can of brake fluid or something to thank
them. (I hate being a mooch.)
