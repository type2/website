Subject: No fire #3 hole...The sad truth
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991109084556.00921840_at_pop.mylink_dot_net&gt;

Volks,

My hands were trembling as I slowly threaded the compression tester into
her #3 cylinder head, in the two months I had know her we had been close.
And now, I was just begining to see her intermost secrets.  I gently
brushed the wires and hoses back as I tightened the tester down and turned
the ignition switch.....hoping for a lasting relationship, but deep down
knowing it just couldn't last.  Things had seemed to simple and to good.  A
great price on a great bus.....life was good.

And then like a ton of bricks it hit me, NO COMPRESSION ON THE #3 CYLINDER.
 I had been jilted before by a lot of women, but nothing like this.

The sad truth is now I have to decide between a head job, a home rebuild or
an AVP longblock.  After a quick look on the internet it dosen't look like
the dollar difference between the three options is that great, so i'm now
leaning toward the AVP longblock.

As it will probably take me a week or more (damn those torque converter
bolts are tough to get too....is there a secret?) to get the old engine out
i've got some time and would greatly appreciate the imput of anyone willing
to take the time.

Thanks for the advise

PS: Thanks to all those who with their advise have gotten me this
far.........this is a great resource.

PSS: As this note has been sitting here unmailed for about
a week I now have the engine out and will order the AVP longblock today.
