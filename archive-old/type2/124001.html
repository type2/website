Subject: RE: [T2] SVDA distributor

Hi Volks- I would hate to disagree with you, but I had A.J. Sims rebuild a
set of Kadrons for me. First the bushings that he installed would stick and
not return to idle. Return one. After I had received the carbs back, the
secondary venturi fell out and was sucked into the engine. Return two. After
replacing the p and c's and installing the carbs, the bushings were still
sticking. Return three. I have received the carbs back, but have not
installed them as I don't want anymore trouble and the STOCK Kadrons that
are on the engine now run fine. I would NOT recommend AJ Sims for quality
work. Ted Finesman
