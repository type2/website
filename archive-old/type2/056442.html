I'll be the first to second Craig K's assessment of Karl Von Salzens value
to at least we newbies. His parts support is great, and better, *every* time
I've found a descrepancy between pubs/archives etc, he has supplied the
resolution that worked! I not only wouldn't have rebuilt our squished
hightops' engine last spring, but I wouldn't even have bought our latest
&quot;cheapie&quot; camper if he were not available as the best on-line-mentor in the
*business*  Marv Krupp
