Subject: suggestions please

Hi everyone:
    Does anyone know of a decent mechanic and or parts supplier (new and
used preferably) in the north central Virginia area. I live in
Charlottesville and am anticipating that my transmission is ready to
croak. This is far beyond the scope of my meager abilities (I can barely
tune the thing), so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance:
Jeff
