Subject: 71 brake booster installation question

Good evening all,

     Received a used booster from a list member

who saved me from spending 300 plus dollars

on a new unit. My problem is the unit is extremely 

rusty inside where the master cylinder hooks up.

Should I spray WD-40 down into it and try to clean 

it out that way, or will that dmage the rubber diaphram?

Also is it possible to replace the booster without removing 

the master cylinder. It looks like I should be able to 

disconnect it from the booster and slide it back to clear

the studs. I really hate to remove it again, (3x's thanks alot 

A1 Cardone!!!) Last but not least, the rod that hooks to the 

brake pedal do I hold this stationary and unscrew from 

the booster side or disconnect from the pedal and turn the rod

itself???

 

Thanks for all you input,

Paul Saulsbury
