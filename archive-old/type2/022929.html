Check on the online auction sites.  I've bought a 1970 and a 1974 
Campmobile owner's supplement off of there.  Price depends on who you're 
bidding against, but they usually go for $10 to $20 (Try searching under 
&quot;Westfalia&quot; and/or &quot;Campmobile&quot;).

You should also try Vintage Motorbooks, ran by a guy named Logan Gray.  He 
seems to have a little of everything at good prices.  That's where I got my 
1968 Campmobile owner's supplement.
