Subject: Great VW TV Program

I caught a segment tonight on &quot;Wild about Wheels&quot;, a program carried on the
SpeedVision Channel.  The channel is available on satallite.  I have the DSS
system. It will be repeated Thursday Oct. 3 1996 at 10 am and 5:30 pm EDT.

It was 10 minutes about the VW Bus.  They showed maybe 6 or 7 old TV ads for
the Bus.  They started with the splits and went up through the coming EVs.
Many great action pictures of panels, ambulances etc.  The VW section was
the last story of the program.

This is well worth seeing.  I loved it.  I may have to get a working VCR to
tape this program.  One thing that they said was that the bus was originally
know as the &quot;Ox&quot;, or rather the German equivilant.  I can't remember the
word.  This was to denote the amount of cargo it could carry.  If you can
get the program, don't miss it.  Its channel # 306 on DTV.

Bill
