Subject: [T2] Cry For Help-Thanks!!!

WOW, overwhelming response, thanks everyone! FWIW, I went back out to the 
garage, and with the help of my lovely wife, finally managed to fish it out. 
Still had a bear of a time getting that plug back in-I'm afraid the hole may 
be cross-threaded, I didn't like the feel of it as it went back in. I did 
remember the hose trick, and tried that. I also USED to have one of those 
magnetic pick up tools, however, I also have a seven year old daughter who 
likes to play with it, and it was nowhere to be found. I'm going to get 
another one to keep in my now LOCKED tool cabinet. The plugs I removed were 
Champion- I was told many years ago by a VW mechanic NEVER use Champion plugs 
in a VW- I put Bosch plugs in. Also, this is funny, PO told me he had just 
had the starter replaced (I have the old one) but it was still hard to start. 
No wonder, the battery cables practically disintegrated when I removed them 
to put new cables on. Who replaces a starter when the battery cables are 
totally shot? Go figure. Thanks again!   Jeff S.
