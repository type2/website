Subject: Who is in BC, particularly Lower Mainland ?

Seems like thar' are many Breadloafs on our roads.  We are an intelligent
bunch, self sufficient mechanically, and wired in.

So, hands up for all the breadloaf drivers hailing from BC, Vancouver or
Lowermainland particularly (but all others too, as the point of the Westy is
to roam about, right?).  Actually, better than that, send me an email, and
I'll compose a list from all those who send in, and send the list of email
addressed back out for mutual co-operative ventures.  Perhaps we can all
decent like vultures on any van's being parted out in the Buy &amp; Sell to pick
its bones clean of valuable parts.

Is there a local &quot;club&quot; or Type 2 group?


Nice to know who's in town.
