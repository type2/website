     Hi Steve,  I removre the distributor only because it is so easy to do 
     and I can no longer focus that close nor get my head back far enough 
     to do so.  For a while (while I was in denial) I used a mirror but 
     that was a royal pain.  If you're going to remove distributor be sure 
     to have exztra o-rings handy and you might as well be sure the bolt &amp; 
     nut for the clamp are in good shape.  They're usually rounded off from 
     the PO.  You'll also discover any problems with shaft wear by taking 
     the dist off once in a while.  Be careful not to drop the nut &amp; washer 
     that holds the dist to the case.  
     Ray
