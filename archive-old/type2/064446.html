RE:     Copy of: Brake dust from Hell

Hey all,  Need some advice on removing STUBBORN brake dust from alloy wheels.
Don't even bother suggesting stuff like &quot;Armor All wheel cleaner&quot; and the like.
Lemme just say I have even tried mineral spirits and a stiff bristle brush to no
avail. The damn stuff is on there like paint! 

Anybody got any solutions of a solution that'll take this crap off without
eating up the clearcoat?
