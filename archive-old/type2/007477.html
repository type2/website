....I had a similar problem with my '79 this past summer.It turned out to be the little piece that holds the clutch cable to the pedal cluster(that bolts to the end of the pedal assembly) was slowly breaking.Check your clutch pedal travel first. If it's too loose,and  you can't adjust out the slack, I would unbolt the pedal assembly from the front frame rail and check that puppy out........
Good luck!
