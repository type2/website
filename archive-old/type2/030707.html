Went to the basement and looked at this this morning-

I too have had the engine out of my '69 more times than I can remember.
It happens to be an excruciatingly original example of a '69 US-spec
Westfalia, with the exception of a transplanted '71 trans and engine
combo. 

Neither the original '69 trans nor the new '71 have rear supports.  Never
had 'em.  In fact, when I originally located a replacement trans (a '72) I
was taken aback by the fact that it had a built-in hanger on the
bellhousing!

Ed. note- There was nothing that matched up to this bellhousing mount
attached to the bus AT ALL. So no use for a rear trans hanger.  Sure would
be nice, tho.  

Moral: '68-71, no original rear trans support.  On US models at least
(can't speak for others).  '72-79, supports on bellhousing.  

Any corroborative evidence?
