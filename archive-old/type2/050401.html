Subject: RE: [T2] buying a bus thats been &quot;sitting&quot; - ?

 Obviously if
&gt;&gt;you have a cable clutch there is no need to address this other than
&gt;&gt;inspection for fraying, lubrication and adjustment. 
&gt;
&gt;Don't push the clutch in too vigorously the first time, and don't yank on
&gt;the handbrake.  I've seen both broken because they were frozen in the sheath.

If the inspection occures BEFORE you buy it, DO jerk them cables hard. If
they are ready to break you want it to happen BEFORE you negotiate the
price. In the majority of cases with a long sitting idle vehicle, if they
gave it to you for free, by the time you actually fix everything you'll
have more bucks in it than anyone is likely to pay you for it. It takes me
at least 2 hours to inspect a vehicle to the extent that I can make a
reasonable estimate of true value.
