hi

Does the rat have the hatch in the roof?

no, and im glad because i want to put a roof rack on it.  it has the SO 44
westy kit with the fold out &quot;Z&quot; bed and cabinet in the back,  and backwards
facing seat and cooler box behind the bench seat.


  My '64 has those four brackets, and I
have the tent poles, but haven't yet gotten the fabric for the tent (one of
these days, I'll get a sail shop to make one up for me).  Sorry the poles are
not FS.- - -
lucky you 

  I can't clue you as to whether the back bumper has a bracket, since
mine is not original, but I did find a front bumper with bracket and
overriders
for mine in a junk yard (I was so surprised that I bought it even though
that's
not what I went there for).

i do that too

  I can say that the rear pole fits nicely into the
hole in the rear bumper where the overrider should be.  This stuff is getting
rarer than hen's teeth, so good luck on your search.

Subject: '78 bus for sale, Michigan

Hello all,

        this is not my bus, but it is one that Mark J. &amp; I spent several 
hours checking out.  I'm just passing the word on.

        It's a '78 bus, 7 passenger.  Gas heater, works.  130k miles plus
however many the PO put on it when the speedo cable was broken.  Engine
appears to be original according to serial number.  Needs an exhaust now
(rust).  It's lived mostly in Colorado (sand, not salt) but has been here
for a couple of years.  Assorted dings &amp; dents, but not ugly.  Driver's
side rocker has rust-out ~3/4&quot; wide by over 1' long.  Sliding door side
rocker has ~3/4&quot; wide by several inches long rust through.  Interior is
fine; no major rips noticed.  Oh, int. is brown.  Compression ranges from
105-120psi.  Still fuel injected.  Tires have plenty of adequate tread. 
Neither brakes nor clutch nor shocks have been replaced in the last 30k,
so they could be due.  Lots of miles betwen CA/CO/MI.  No excessive play
in the steering box.  Comes w/ a Bentley &amp; a bike rack.  Several inches of
foam/rubber engine seal strip missing at the right rear (between tin &amp;
body).  Sub-mm play perpendicular to axle detected in right axle/cv's. 
Mark &amp; I felt that the engine was a tad on the hot side after driving a
few miles around town, but that's a touchy-feely impression; may be o.k. 

        Overall feel is used, not abused.  Asking price is 
$1500--definitely seems to be in the ballpark.  Only thing that it seems 
to need &quot;today&quot; is the exhaust (rust-out just before the muffler).  
Muffler should be replaced at the same time, IMHO.  It could be due for 
lots &amp; lots of routine (or semi-routine) repairs, and would need rocker 
replacement &amp; medium dent/ding repair (&amp; therefore paint, too) to make it 
actually pretty.  Shocks, brakes, cv's &amp; clutch could be fine for years 
or all decide to &quot;expire&quot; tomorrow.

        The seller is David; email via his wife's account at 
lgbell_at_umich_dot_edu.  I have the phone number somewhere... the bus is in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan.  (411 Pearl, actually!)  They're selling so that 
they can buy an '87 Westy.

        Please follow up to David via email.  Mark might remember some 
details that I've forgotten, but this is all of the major stuff.  Oh!  I 
took some video of the bus &amp; got some frame grabs.  (Bill C. in Cleveland 
was interested in it...)  They're up on a web page... actually, just 
sitting in this directory:

http://www-personal.engin.umich_dot_edu/~gregm/78bus/

It was dark with poor lighting; better than nothing, I guess.

Subject: The Magic rust remover?

IN the late '70s JC Whitney sold a rust remover called Rust-biox.
Advertised to eat rust but not paint, it was non-toxic, non-caustic, and
bio-degradeable, and in a gel form.  And IT WAS ALL THAT and worked
(although slowly).  The idea was that there was some &quot;natural&quot; chemical
reaction that ate the rust.

While it worked slowly, it did it's job and ate rust and not paint, and I
mean ATE it.  The rust would be gone.._dot_completely.  And bare metal with a
&quot;zinc phosphate&quot; coating would be left in it's place.  It was great for
superficial rust and for touch-ups.  Not as good on heavy rust.

This miracle stuff disappeared from the catalog in the early 80s and in the
mid 80's some new similar stuff took its place.  This &quot;new stuff&quot;   was a
liquid which made similar claims to the Rust-biox but didn't do as good a
job... but it did work.

I don't believe that either product is in the catalog any longer, although
it's been years since I checked.  I don't have a current catalog.

Soooo, does anyone remember this stuff, know how it worked, know how to get
it, etc?

We should research this stuff and find a source for it.  What market would
be better than a bunch of transporter fanatics fighting the constant war
against rust?

&gt; &gt;As to a new pedal, it does not look good.  VWofA reports
&gt; &gt;that accelerator pedals for busses are no longer available.
&gt; &gt;BusBoys does not have one.  RMMW does not have one.  And
&gt; &gt;with the bracket welded down...
&gt;
&gt; I watched David Easterwood do this to my 68 last January. (This ain't too
&gt; elegant, but it's held up fine).
&gt;
&gt; Go to the hardware store, get a barn door hinge. A little less wide than
&gt; the pedal. Take the broken pedal and the hinge to a muffler shop. Ask them
&gt; to cut the hinge about in half (take the points off it).
&gt;
&gt; Then, have them weld one side of the hinge to the pedal such that the
&gt; geometry stays as close to the original as possible. Show them, don't tell
&gt; them. Those folks ain't too bright sometimes.
&gt;
&gt; Take the &quot;restored&quot; pedal back to the bus and bolt the free side of the
&gt; hinge to the floor. Mark it and drill holes, then bolt straight through the
&gt; floor. My floor is rusty, too, but there was enough there to bolt to.
&gt;
&gt; I think this all cost about twelve dollars including the welding.
&gt;
As an even cheaper, easier alternative, just bolt the hinge onto the pedal as
well as the floor. Ive done this in my last 2 busses with no problems...

Sorry to be dense, but could someone explain this to me?  I thought
backfiring was caused when a cylinder detonates at some time it's not

related more to incorrect timing, connection of the distributor wires,
etc.  How does the exhaust system affect backfiring at all?

We will be having a small caravan to this giveaway.  Join us, whether
you're a club member or not!

        We'll meet at 10:15ish at Arborland Mall in Ann Arbor.  Arborland
Mall is on Washtenaw, which is exit 37 (I forget:  either 37A or 37B--it's
the westbound direction) of US23.  The mall is right there nestled up
against the highway; you can't miss it.  We'll meet right at the base of
the giant Arborland sign (big digital clock/thermometer).  We'll be on the
highway and Munk-bound by 10:30.  It should be an easy hour's drive to
Munk's.

Subject: Re: Engine from a beetle to fit a t2

There are some variables to consider when you think about engine cooling
tin and engine components (e.g. carb, heads, year of bus (1967? - 1971
took 1600's, etc.).

One difference between some beetle engines and the bus engine is that
beetle engines have no support bracket in the back (rear of bug) of the
engine. Some beetle engines won't accept the rear bracket. Others (with
universal cases) will. Still others must have holes drilled (VERY
carefully) and tapped to accept the bracket. Lots of folks mount the
beetle engines in the bus and forget the bracket, or use an aftermarket
bracket that mounts to the oil cooler bolts. Some think this is unwise.

I think we need more data. What year bus? What year beetle engine?

Subject: rust repair

Hello all. Hope this is of some interest.

I'm in the process of trying to revive my 70 westy. Upon disassembly, I 
found a lot of rust under the front windshield seal, and driver's side rear 
window seal. I am now cutting the rust out and hope to weld in new material. 
The interesting thing here is that I've never done this sort of thing 
before. But, so far, so good, although I haven't actually got around to the 
welding part yet. My welding experience is limited to oxy/fuel, however, I 
am going to buy an inexpensive mig unit ($300) for this job. I figure I 
really can't lose: I was going to junk the bus, but if I can fix it, I'd 
love to put it back on the road. We've had a lot of good times together. I 
have a suspicion that a lot of buses meet their maker because of rust under 
the window seals. I'll keep you posted.

Subject: Piece of metal rod stuck in rubber bushing, how remove?

The right front link of the sway bar on my '82 westy is broken
off just where it attaches in a rubber bushing on the control
arm. The upper part of the broken link popped off the sway bar
with a little persuation and soap water. Problem is that despite
trying several different methods I can't get the remains of the lower
part out of the rubber bushing on the control arm.

The link sheared off just below the bushing. The bottom part with
the treaded portion is still intact. Methods to get it out I've tried
so far:

Hitting with hammer both from below and above, with soap water and
liquid wrench liberally applied. Heat up bottom part with pencil torch
and hammering. Try to turn it by wrench on nut on the treaded lower
part. I did this carefully to not break the treaded part off in case
it is useful for future removal attempts. Hammering may not be the
best method, since the piece is suspended in the rubber bushing.
I also tried to push it out with a hydralic jack, but only thing
that happened was that the front end of the bus lifted up.

Does anybody have better suggestions? I could try drilling it out,
but I'm not likely to be able to drill straight for 2 inches with
a handheld drill, and will most likely just ruin the bushing, while 
still having part of the metal rod stuck in there.

Thanks to Tim Smith, Bill Kennedy, Joel and Bob Hufford for suggestions
on how to fix instead of replace the broken link. This link seem to
be a common thing to break, and several people have just drilled
and threaded the bottom of the link for a bolt, and bolted it back on.

&gt; Re: Westy Tent Poles - roll yer own

&gt;  His point was that the copper
&gt; was cheaper and about half as heavy as the 3/4&quot; conduit. His points were
&gt; well taken but I wonder which tent would remain standing longer in very bad
&gt; weather. Hopefully none of us will find out.

Electrical conduit is also availible in aluminum, and in several sizes. This 
should be a better weight to strength tradeoff. My guess is that the copper
(water pipes?) would be even worse than the steel conduit.

It (steel conduit at least) is also bendable with a &quot;conduit bender&quot; ($10-15 
Hechinger, Home depot or similar).

&gt; 
&gt; I recognise that Dan mentioned his using the OEM poles on his set up. What
&gt; considerations has anyone else or Dan given to the &quot;dirt&quot; end of the poles?
&gt; Rubber plugs? Tack welding short spikes on them?

Duct tape. Also prevents ends from scratching things when put down 
in the under the rear seat storage.

Even a small leak could cause the symptoms that you describe. I had a very 
similar backfiring problem to yours on my 75 Kombi, and fixing the exhaust 
leak (by simply replacing a missing bolt in my case) fixed the problem. 

As this is my first post I guess I should do something of an introduction. 
I live in Canberra in Australia, and I have a 75 kombi with a SOPRU poptop, 
1800 engine (not fuel injected). I am in the long process of fitting it out as 
a camper (as the PO had completely gutted the interior - because he didn't 
like it), and dealing with the many other little problems that arise with it 
from time to time :-}. It is my only transport, and contrary to what many 
people think find it very reliable (well I have only had to have it towed 
once, in 3 years). I originally bought it to fix up and go on a round 
Australia trip, but it never happened :-( , so now it is my daily transport, 
as well as taking me to lots of weekend trips to the snow and the coast 
(depending on the season.)

And now to my squeak. This one is really puzzling me! It is a high pitched 
squeak that seems to be the worst in the mornings when I first start driving 
(it gets down to -6 degrees celsius where I live). It only appears when the 
car is moving, and it doesn't matter whether or not the engine is running. The 
thing that gets me is that it is not a regular squeak - it comes and goes. Oh 
and putting the brakes on lightly doesn't seem to affect the nature of the 
squeak at all.
I had thought it might be brakes so I have pulled the rear drums off, and 
cleaned all the dust out. There was plenty of pad left, and while the drums 
were a bit scored they looked OK to me. I also wondered if the handbrake line 
was freezing up and causing the problem, but I don't really know.

If any one has any ideas, or things I could check, I would be grateful.

Thanks
