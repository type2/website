&gt; I have a stock dual vacuum distributor on a l976 2000cc FI. 
&gt; Does anyone use a Pertronics ignitor on one of these setups and does it work 
&gt; OK?

I've been using a Pertronics in my 2L FI 78 for a couple years without
problems, heck haven,t removed the distributor cap in over a year I think.

seems to work fine

&gt; Somebody told me that the Ignitors do not trigger the fuel injectors in these 
&gt; models of engines and only standard points will. True?
&gt; The Pertonics folks are vague about this issue and only say it &quot;may&quot; work, to 
&gt; try it.
&gt; Easier and cheaper to ask the list first.
