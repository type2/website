Subject: Re: [T2] Repairs done and to do


Regarding the squeal, do you have the piston retaining plates in place?
They seem to be missing on alot of older busses and their absence will cause
the dreaded &quot;squeal&quot;.

&gt;This weekend I replaced the front break pads and rotors, with
&gt; new Pagid pads and new rotors from the Bus Depot (Thanks Ron!). It really
&gt; made a difference, however I am still getting a mild squeel from the front
&gt; when I break. Any suggestions on how to get rid of this?
