The case burning may be in some jeopardy, due to legitimate environmental
concerns. Our location is the watershed for all of Henderson County, a
popular Golden Agers settlement here in the Appalachians. Apparently, the
leftover ashes of the ritual inferno are composed primarily of Magnesium
Oxide, and there was some confusion as to the possible hazards of this
particular chemical. Careful research into the properties of this compound
has revealed it's presence in many commercial topical and ingested products,
such as sunscreen and Milk of Magnesia. It does not have significant
toxicity, but when eaten in excessive quantities it does cause 'Rapid Bowel
Evacuation'. (Check the MSDS! http://www.jtbaker_dot_com/msds/m0182.htm ) You
can understand the concern that if the old folks greeted Sunday morning with
a synchronized flush it might overload the counties' plumbing; and word
would certainly get around.

So, if we are allowed, we must take care.
