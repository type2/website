dont do it wheel cyl are so cheap most don't even bother to rebuild them. 
We're talking less than $10 bucks. If their leaking what will happen is they 
will contaminate the new shoes and you will have wasted that money plus they 
will be wet and won't stop worth a damn. Now a leak won't ruin your drum, 
what will is if the shoes are allowed to go to far and the rivits will gouge 
your drum. If the gouge is too deep the drum cant be turned and now its junk. 
If you hear the noise at only one spot, what you've got is a high spot on the 
drum. I'd advice three things
1 have your drums checked for trueness, if they need to be turned it runs 
about $8 per drum, if they don't need it don't turn em
2 replace the wheel cyls as a set, their too cheap not too
3 if moneys real tight, save it on the shoes, often a shop might have a 
single side of a set or a slightly used set. adj the shoes till the drum is 
tight and then back off the adj a couple of turns. 
thats my story and I'm stickin to it ymmv
