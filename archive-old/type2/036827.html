Subject: Re: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)

&gt; Not neccecarily.  Bus-Depots OR brand has _traditionally_ been brazillian
&gt; BUT: I called busdepot to check on availability of brazilian... I asked
&gt; specifically if their OR part was brazillian or taiwaneese.  They said
&gt; they would have to call their supplier to find out for sure as they dont
&gt; keep them on the shelf.  I have yet to call back and find out what the
&gt; answer is... (ron?? you always seem to know the scoop on this stuff...)
&gt;

I just got an order delivered from Bus Depot for my 67. I ordered 2 left
fronts, 2 right fronts, and 2 rears.  Both left fronts and both rear were
Brazilian. Both right fronts are from China. Anybody have an opinion on
Chinese brake parts?
