&gt; Karl, aren't you familiar with the '70 one-year-only reverse running 
&gt; engine?
&gt; They were a special-order European only model that only runs below the
&gt; equator... grin

Now you're gettin' me all confused...Don't all year engines run backwards
when you shift into reverse...?-(

(Not to be confused with the automatic &quot;R&quot; for Right Straight Ahead... ;-)
