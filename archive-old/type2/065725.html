Subject: Why leaded gasoline is cheaper than unleaded gas.

I believe leaded gas was first manufactured around WWII.  They needed to change
the composition of the gas to prevent detonation and one way to do that
was to add &quot;tetraethyl lead&quot;.  This would lower the ignigtion temp of the gas
and make it run good.  Of course lead is bad so they went to a more involved
refinement process to leave the lead out.
