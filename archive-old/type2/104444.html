&lt;&lt; Mark,

    I've replaced broken exhaust studs, on a '77, with the engine and

head in place.  The exhaust has to come off that side of the engine in

either case.  Then carefully and accurately center punch the broken

stud.  Then drill up the middle of the stud with successively larger

drill bit sizes until all that's left is the remnants of the stud that

are in the threads of the head.  Then use a small scribe and a tap to

clean out the threads.  Then you screw in a new stud and reinstall the

exhaust.

If you're gonna do that, use the shortest bit you can find and drop it
back in the chuck. I've got a Portalign frame (Sears carries it as
Craftsman) that turns a hand drill into a portable drill press. Gives
you a wide 'footprint' to keep the bit perpendicular to the stud. It's
usually the slight movement off, that snaps the bit and leaves a
bit point in the broken stud...
