Subject: Re: [T2] I'm at a loss......

Ted,

But how does it run?????

Vacuum weirdness may be from the engle 110.....high overlap cam?

Timing light weirdness from cross wire induction pickup?
(wires running side by side for long runs).

Points or electronic??  Points bounce??  Bad points?
Bad spring on points....

Vacuum advance bad?  Just for grins put a vacuum pump on the cannister and 
pull a few pounds...then see where your points &quot;snap&quot; as you slowly rotate 
the engine toward 28 degrees.  Leave the vacuum pump on for a little 
while and see if it bleeds down.  

Visually inspect...make sure small 
braided wire inside dist is there and tied down good on both ends..

Cheers ,dave

&gt; The Vw G_ds are frowning on me lately. I have a '71 Westy that had a
&gt; 1600 DP w/ extractor,Kadrons, and a vacuum advance dizzy. Got horrible
&gt; gas mileage and my vacuum gauge started jumping all over the place at
&gt; idle. While I was getting ready to go to EB found very low compression
&gt; in #3. I thought that I would switch engines to a 1776 that had about
&gt; 100 miles on it built from a new case, Berg CW crank, Engle 110 cam,
&gt; Berg exhaust, totally balanced by Berg from the crank pulley to the
&gt; clutch, Dellorato 40's, and all tin and thermostat installed.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, got it in the night before Circle Yer Wagons and it started
&gt; right up. Great, thought I. Tried to set the timing and ,at 3000 rpm,
&gt; the timing mark jumps all over the place from TDC to 45 degrees advance.
&gt; Steady at idle. My vacuum gauge still jumps all over the place at idle.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I have tried...
&gt; 1.Two different timing lights - same results.
&gt; 2. Two different distributors- same results.
&gt; 3. Adjusted valves 3 times.
&gt; 4. Replace cap, rotor, and spark plug wires.
&gt; 5. Sprayed for vacuum leaks and couldn't find any.
&gt; 6. Re-installed Kadron carbs- same results.
&gt; 7. Compression check shows all cylinders above 120 with less that 5%
&gt; difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone shed some light on what I might try or the cause of the
&gt; problems? PLEASE!!!! I'm tired of having to eat all the cherries
&gt; myself-I wanna go camping... TBear  PS Couldn't find any help in the
&gt; archives.  
&gt; 
&gt; Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
