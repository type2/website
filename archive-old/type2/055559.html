&gt; The oil cooler has never blocked air flow to the #3 cylinder. A

The big difference between the non-doghouse and doghouse shrouds is
that the air heated by the oil cooler remained inside the shroud in
the early shrouds and was directed past the cylinders.  Not good to
use pre-heated air to cool the cylinders!

In the doghouse shroud, the air heated by the oil cooler is exhausted
via its own ductwork through the front tin and does not pass by the
cylinders on the way out.  The fan was also made larger to compensate
for the diversion of air flow.
