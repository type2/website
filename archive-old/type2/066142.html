Subject: Re: Cleaner air

&gt;I am located in SO Cal. I am looking into doing the Suburu conversion on
&gt;my TYPE 2 69. I talked with a smog rEp and they told me they expected me
&gt;to have every last smog part the Suburu came with, including the
&gt;CATALYTIC CONVERTER (!!!!!?????)  I do not know what is up, but I thought
&gt;you guysd mightr like to know that is what they told me as of yesterday,
&gt;tues.
        One way around this, sadly not doable on the breadloafs, is to buy
a diesel model. If it was sold as diesel they don't even look at it, you
are exempt from the whole mess, or so I've been told... Now if you can
somehow come up with a piece of paper stating the '69 was indeed a
diesel...  To my knowledge breadloaves were not made with a diesel option,
at least not in the US.

Peace,
