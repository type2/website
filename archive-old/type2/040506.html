Subject: Re: 2.0L heads

Tom,

  Here is the story.  A little long so here goes.  I start getting a little
lifter noise in the morning.  They pump up after a few seconds so I do not
really think much about it.  After a few weeks I notice some lifter or valve
clicking almost all of the time.  I decided to check my hydraulic lifter
adjustment.  I do this &amp; notice that 4 or 5 of my rockers are contacting the
valve stem even with the adjusting screw totally removed.  Most of the
advice I get says I have pounded in valve seats.  I take the heads to a
local (Portland, OR.)machine shop that is recommended to me by a number of
the local VW repair shops.  They tell me that I have 5 pounded seats &amp; a few
repairable cracks.  They tell me that I have rebuildable heads &amp; do not need
new ones.  After I get the heads back &amp; am calculating the compression ratio
I notice the combustion chamber volume is too small.  Was 39cc &amp; was told 55
was about right.  My deck height was .018&quot;.  After I take the heads back to
the machine shop they tell me that the heads are on the end of the wear
cycle that is why the small chamber volume.  They try to open up the
combustion chambers to 42cc with another 14cc in the dish on the pistons
that is 56cc.  When I get the heads back today &amp; go to install the rockers,
lo &amp; behold the rockers are contacting the valve stems.  Needless to say, I
am getting weary of this.  I want my bus running.  I am beginning to think I
should have just bought a AVP rebuild.  Any words or wisdom would be
appreciated.
