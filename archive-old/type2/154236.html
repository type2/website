Subject: Help, and Ouch!

Sorry, I know it's not Friday, but this is a carry over from last Friday.

 

I'm having problems with the &quot;new&quot; old camper.  

 

I got into the camper to repair the floor and the walls and found a TON of
rotten wood.  I think im in over my head.. 

 

Anyone want to help out with it?  Anyone want to buy it?  ($300) ish.....

 

Good News:  Frame is great and tows like a dream. 

Bad News:  both rear portions of the side walls will need reinforceing.

 

Check out the pictures.
