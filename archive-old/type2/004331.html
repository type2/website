Subject: Re: [T2] Drilling case to take mounting bar



&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've recently seen a totally rusty 1302 with a good(72k miles)1600 DP-the
&gt;&gt; beetles going very cheaply so my reasoning is that if the engine has only
&gt;&gt; been powering a beetle is it likely to be less stressed and therefore a
good
&gt;&gt; replacement for my engine-and what would be involved in drilling and
tapping
&gt;&gt; for the engine bearer.Anyone have any experience of this -i'm assuming i
can
&gt;&gt; us my tin as my bus is a '71 with an upright engine-Cheers Martin

I did this on a case a couple of years ago and it worked fine.  Make sure to
use your rear hanger as a guide so the holes line up, and check the depth of
the holes with the bolts by measuring the hanger to bolt head clearance. You
don't want to go too deep.  To get the last few threads you will need to use
a bottoming tap for the bottom of the holes.  (I was very paranoid about
going too deep, you may be able to get by with a regular tap and a little
deeper hole, but I wasn't willing to take the risk.)  The thread inserts are
a good idea, but  I didn't use casesavers/helicoils, and it was strong
enough.  Good luck.
