I know some of you out there are having this same problem.

I staart my '69 bus (DP, 34PICT, 009, etc.) at 6:20 am.  Runs
like the proverbial crapola.  Won't idle if you touch the 
pedal after you have set the choke.  Acts like this for the 1st
7-9 min of driving no matter the warm-up time. (Only under 55deg.
F air temp)  Stalls, hesitates, huge flat spots, etc.

After this time period, runs and drives fine.

I have checked all the usual culprits, is there something I'm 
overlooking?????

TIA,

Your pal,

Blake

'69 Westfalia
