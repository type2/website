today i finally traded my 78 champainge bus to a guy who really wanted it. 
It took about 6-7 months to find the guy and I had been paying rent to keep 
the bus from getting scrapped. i have 8 other cars scattered around and had 
just  gotten kicked out of the garage I was renting. A friend &quot;temporarily 
stored&quot; the bus for two weeks at his job until the guy could come and get 
it.
   It poured and rained here in NY (AGAIN) during the entire trip but I was 
saitified with the parts I received and happy that the bus was saved and 
found a good home.

hoping the rain stops here in NY
