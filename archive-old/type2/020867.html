Sorry I wasn't clear, the 13&quot; TV we got is used in the Minivan with an
inverter for playing tapes/videogames- and doesn't come AC/DC.  Yes,
many 9&quot; and most 5&quot; tv's come with a DC option, usually 12 volts.  The
78 Westy has an old Magnavox dual voltage 9&quot; that was one of the first
with an autoprogram to program channels in a strange area; it's fallen
about 3 times and still works!

&gt; Many 9&quot; TVs are AC/DC.  It would be much more efficient to run the TV
&gt; directly on DC if possible.
