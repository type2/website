Subject: Mark Stephens Update #2...
Mime-Version: 1.0

List,

Further research into the increasingly cold trail of Mark Stephens
and his &quot;High Performance&quot; crew.  Thanks to Ronnie Feitelson I called
WEST COAST VW who picked up most of the parts and all of the remaining
crew of the MSHP shop.  All of the parts that were not sold by the
company or taken by them.  There is apparently a semi-trailer full
of parts and tools that Mark managed to make off with.  My engine is
long gone.  It had the 1.8 liter heads (went through 4 sets getting ones
this good), chambered, cc'ed, chambered and flowed; full-circle crank
(built for Mark by Bernie Bergman then &quot;blueprinted&quot; by Demillo for same);
block that had only 20k on it, German Mahle pistons/cylinders; rods 
(4 best out of 20) with RaceWare bolts; etc.  Everything balanced and
prepped out the wazoo.  I sincerely hope that these parts are whole again
and humming smoothly down the road for someone since I'll never see
them again. . .

On a happier note, Moe (John) at West Coast VW was a most informative guy.
He builds a huge amount of Type 1 and 2 motors on the wholesale market in
CA.  He says he does less than 2% of his work retail and gets to fix the
work of others (you can guess who) on a daily basis.  Builds 10-12 motors
a week, on average.  Has worked out his own cam profile on the Type IV motor
(&quot;T1&quot; profile, ground by Web-Cam), guarantees seats for 100k, long block
for 12 months, 12k.  Prices are $649.95 for the Upright, $1599.95 for the
hydraulics 2-liter Type IV, $1700 for the Vanagon motor and an extra
$249.00 for complete weight + dynamic balancing (needs clutch and alt. fan).

He also has access to the last 6 square port BRAND NEW VW MOTORS WITH
SQUARE PORT HEADS (2 liter).  THESE ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND $2495.00 EACH
(sorry for yelling, but I meant to put this in the first paragraph).  Moe 
says he might be able to work out free shipping if you get on one of these
before the end of the year. No core required on these.

Well, that's what I found out.  Now I need to go lick my wounds and get
another motor under way...

Warning:  YMMV, Caveat Emptor, etc.
