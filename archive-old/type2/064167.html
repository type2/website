Subject: Geeze, there more bad news!

Okay... I've spent several hours as a grease monkey... here's more 
stuff!

The type IV is out of the westy... It came with a parting out bus...

So... no wires labeled, no pipes identified.. 

I have most of th time removed.... can't deal with the mufler yet cause 
th bolts are rusted on to that... BUT here's where my chin really fell 
today.

I took out th oil drain plug... and guess what came out first ?  Water!

I guess the motor wasn't as sheltered as it should have been.


Yep, water then oil!

Okay nuff for now, I'm of to have another look at the muffler and read 
more of Muir's book!

Any suggestions appreciated...

Barry Mercer!
