Why not try Just Kampers, I think they buy direct from VW Brazil, they may
be able to get the parts you want as a special order.

&gt; BTW - sorry to be serious on Friday, but is it possible for anyone anywhere
&gt; in the world to buy NEW Brazilian bus parts - like fuel filler necks of
&gt; tanks or whatever?
