&lt;&lt; i can't remember which direction for star adjustment, but a few
months ago someone on here suggested to mark the backing
plates with an arrow once you get it figured out. that should
help with future brake adjustments.

good luck.
 &gt;&gt;

Looking thru the adjustment hole, visualise each adjustment star
going clockwise towards the center (between each hole) to ad-
just brake shoes out towards the drum.

Passenger/left brake:
Front adjuster goes top to bottom.
Rear adjuster goes bottom to top.

Driver/left brake:
Front adjuster goes bottom to top.
Rear adjuster goes top to bottom.

(Assuming LHD...)
