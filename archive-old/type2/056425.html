Subject: Weber carb for sale.

I have a good condition single weber carb setup that I would like to sell.

I upgraded my ignition to a dual vacuum advance electronic unit from a CA
Vanagon, and this would not work with the Weber.  You need to run the Weber
with a 09 dizzy, or similar unit.  I installed the dual Weber 34ICT carbs that
will allow for the vacuum advance and retard.

The Weber includes the manifolds, air filter and linkage.  I consider any
offers close to $100.  Or  doesn't sell, I will list it on ebay in a week or
two.
