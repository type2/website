Subject: Progressive Weber Kit

I purchased a progressive weber kit for my 73' bus because I got tired of 
messing with the dual carb routine.  Not sure if this was a good idea.  I 
started assembling the kit last nite and realized that the left running 
plumbing sits too high after it is torqued down.  The rubber sleeve that 
attaches the runner to the manifold is off-set by a quarter inch on this 
side.  I'm going to take it apart tonite, but was wondering if anyone has 
run into this problem.  I'm simply (hopefully) going to bend this runner 
down 1/8 to a quarter inch so that it will align with the manifold port.  
Any suggestions how?
Lo
