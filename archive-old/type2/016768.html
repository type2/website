&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I don't know if it was asbestos, but i think i'm mentally coming down
&gt; with something.....tell me it wasn't!
&gt; 
&gt; It was the white fiborous(sp?) material on the inside of the plastic
&gt; insulation cover.
Dave:
I don't think it's asbestos, I think it's fiberglass. There IS some
fiberglass around the flex hoses connecting the heat exchangers to the
y-pipe.
I don't think asbestos was as dangerous to USERS as was thought at one
time. I'v heard stories of J-M employees who were just white with the
dust from manufacturing products with it sitting down to supper with
their families, etc, and of course they're all dead, but the difference
between that type of exposure and consumers being exposed to a few
fibers is not even measurable. If it makes any difference to you
asbestos exposure is also much worse in conjunction with smoking,
apparently.
I sure hope so, anyway, I've sure knocked alot of it off pipes and
broomed up the dust!!
