&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; A few weeks ago a posting was made on the list about
&gt; the heat, noise and rust
&gt; site that had recently gone on-line.  I just want to
&gt; say, this is an
&gt; incredible source of inspiration. I people haven't
&gt; viewed it yet, they really
&gt; should!

&gt; if you missed it first time around:

&gt; http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/heatdum.html
&gt; 

I can only ad that after checking out the site....  We
are planning a &quot;refurb&quot; of the '79 &quot;Blue Bus&quot; and will
incorporate many of the suggestions found in the above
website....

Hats off to the author!
