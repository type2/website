Subject: '76 Bus starts, then dies

Hello Type 2 list:

I recently &quot;adopted&quot; a '76 Campmobile from a good friend who is leaving the 
area.  He couldn't bear to sell his VW to a stranger so I'm giving it a good 
home.  It runs great (usually) but yesterday after a short trip to town it 
now only starts and runs for a couple of seconds then it dies.

I plan on installing new &quot;tune up&quot; parts this week; cap, rotor, points, 
plugs, condensor, and fuel filter.  My Haynes and VW manuals indicate to 
check these items first before looking at the fuel injection system.

The cap and rotor were carbon pitted.  I tried to clean them up as best I 
could with some emery paper.  No change.  I haven't yet inspected the 
points.  I understand that the FI system can be affected by improper opening 
of the points too.

Anyt other thougts and suggestions on what to check?

Thanks and best regards,

Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
