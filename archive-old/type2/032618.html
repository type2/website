&gt; For $300 this looks like the a bilge blower fan on roids. These guys claim
&gt; on their web site that it puts 0.5 psi of pressure on the intake system 
&gt; where there is normally 0.5 psi of vacuum.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you put one of these on your bus, let us know..

from their website:
A 3 liter engine draws about 320 CFM at 6000 rpm. The fan has to produce
that airflow at a 1/2psi pressure. To do this, with all the inefficiencies
of flow and restriction, about 700 watts is needed. This is less than 1 hp
of electrical energy required at 13 volts drawing about 50 amps. This
gives a net 4-6% HP gain at the driven wheels, which is maintained
throughout the HP curve. It's not peaky like a cam or header, but constant
from end to end

It says it draws 50 amps, well on a t1 engine bus the alternator is 50
amps, it would use all charging system output.  Dunno if things are much
better on a t4 engine bus, but that is a lot of draw.

Better for occasional use, but with a 4 to 6 percent gain in HP, its
probably not even worth it.  Figure a 60 horse motor... 5% gain, that
ammounts to 3 horses, 1 is used up to run the blower, thus a net gain
of 2 hp... wont really let you pass mustangs on an uphill grade... if
you could cut out charging while using it you could gain 3 hp... but that
seems like a lot of expense and work for a measly 3hp you could only use
momentarily.  I bet you could get more than 2hp other ways much cheaper...

peas,

Steve
