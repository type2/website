Subject: Re: [T2] Soaked! winfshield wiper help

No washer motor, it works off the pressure in the tank.  You must have some
hardened hoses, try cutting a bit off the end, then re-attach them.  The
wiper handle is a valve that lets the washer fluid flow, after you fix the
hoses, the valve may lossen up when the fluid hits it.  Don't put too much
pressure in the tank, I would start with 20PSI.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; I went to get my 77 Bus safety test done and my windshield wipers failed. They
&gt; were not spraying. As soon as I filled the tank with air pressure..... I was
&gt; soaked! Seemed the hoses were not connected. I reconnected them and tried
&gt; again. Seems that as soon as I fill the tank with air the driver's side
&gt; sprayer goes off without me pushing on the wiper handle. Any ideas on how to
&gt; fix this? Is it wired wrong? Do I need a new windshield washer motor? And
&gt; where the heck is the washer motor?
&gt; 
&gt; Soaked in Utah,
