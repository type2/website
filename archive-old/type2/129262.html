Subject: supressed vs non-supressed regulator

Yeah, it's me again.

I think I may have ordered the wrong part.  I have been basically
rebuilding my charging system from scratch, and I actually had it
charging for a few minutes yesterday.  When I started, the alternator
was fried.  There was a short in the system (red light on - key off.) I
didn't know about the alternator at this point, so I ordered a new
voltage regulator. (start with cheapest parts, if it isn't that part,
you have a spare!)  I fully admit stupidity and ordered the standard
voltage regulator for my bus from BD without first checking part
numbers.  I got the part, installed it, and no change. (by that time,
the condition had changed from red light on without key to red light on
when driving, no short remaining.)  This indicated alternator, so I
replaced the alternator with a new standard AL75XOR from BD.  On sale even!

So, when I go to swap alternators, I discover the old alternator is
frizzle-fried, and the wiring harness is burned through the conduit in
three different places.  (PO jump started bus with reversed polarity on
battery.)  I decide to create a new harness, and so I now have a
homemade harness, new AL75XOR alternator, and a standard voltage
regulator.  I fire it up, and I still have red light on while engine is
running.  what the f&amp;$#!!!  I drive it 10 miles to my relative's garage,
and have a beer while I think.

When I swapped the regulators, I noticed the PNs were different.  The PN
off the one that came out of the bus showed up as being twice as
expensive, but as being &quot;supressed.&quot;  I barely understand what this means. 

So the next day (yesterday) on a hunch, I decide to try swapping the old
regulator back in, and I hook up the voltmeter, and yipppeeee!!!! I'm a
charging fiend.  The reading at the battery seemed a little high (~17v)
but wow, that's some improvement.  I leave the engine running, and start
packing up the tools and stuff.  It ran for maybe 10 minutes, and then
the engine tone changed a little bit, and I figured I might as well shut
it off.  So, off it went. key out of the ignition, RED LIGHT BACK ON!
F$%#!!!!  Oh, and to make things even peachier, white smoke coming from
alternator housing. drat.  I disconnected the battery and felt the
wires, they didn't feel hot, and I couldn't see and scorching of the
insulation.  The white smoke went away pretty soon, and so I decided to
tempt fate and run some &quot;tests.&quot;

here's how it sits. (note: at this point, alternator *may* be
compromised! $80 down the drain!)

old alternator -&gt; definitely fried.  parts melted to housing.

1. new alternator, new (non-suppressed) voltage regulator -&gt; 12v at
battery, red light on while running
2. new alternator, old (supressed) voltage regulator -&gt; 17v at battery,
then white smoke.... red light on when keys not in ignition

just to check, swapped red and green wires with new regulator, just in
case they were connected wrong at the alternator.  This did nothing good.


So, what it comes to:  What the hell?  does this regulator supressed vs.
non-supressed explain 17v at the battery and white smoke, or no charge
at all?  Should I just scrap the lot and start over with a new
alternator, new voltage regulator, and in that case, which should I get?
supressed or non?  I'm really confused on this one!

'74 bus

(which made it from Vancouver, WA to Lynnwood, WA (~200 miles) at night,
with NO charging system, red light on all the way, driving at 60 mph,
lost battery power (with a shower of sparks out the rear?? about 10
miles before final destination, had a spare, swapped it, and made it! So
in lynnwood it sits, finally in a driveway in front of a garage!  My new
home!  So all you seattlites, My beer is good.)
