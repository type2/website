Subject: stranded bus: FI, Vacuum or Electric

Well, my bus let me down tonight, the night before I'm supposed to get my
engine from AVP. It's either electrical or fuel injection-related or maybe
vacuum-related. Ken came to my rescue, but we had to nurse the bus back
near my work in a relatively safe spot and leave him there for future
fixing or towing.

Here's what happened:

I started him up (ambient temp about 45F) and let him warm for a minute or
so. I put him in gear and as soon as I moved, I heard a loud pop. I'm
pretty certain that was a stuck brake. Drove about 2/10 of a mile to a
traffic light and stopped. Seemed like some evil demon suddenly posessed
Fyn, as he began to flash lights and sputter. He did not respond well to my
attempts to keep him alive. He died. I nursed him off the road by starting,
giving gas and moving 5 feet; then repeat 20 times--he died every time.
Finally, I used my leg muscles to push him into a parking lot out of traffic.

Once I got him into a parking lot, I tried feeling around in the dark for a
loose wire or vacuum hose and found nothing. I had left my cell phone and
my flashlight elsewhere and I was in a prime spot for Memphis gangsters to
say &quot;Ooooo! Look, someone in the wrong neighborhood!&quot; So after about 10
minutes of trying, I hoofed it back to work and called Ken.

I printed Sami's troubleshooting tips that I thought applied to me and
numbered them so I could flip through them. (I'm thinking maybe I'll
produce a PDF like this and give it to Sami for a Christmas present ;). Ken
and I ran through all of these and I thought I'd found the problem in the
AFM, so I swapped it out with a spare. No luck.

I discovered that if I unhooked the AFM, I could get Fyn to idle. It was
getting late, so we gave up the ghost and nursed him back to a relatively
safe (well-lighted at least) spot, where I hope he's sleeping quietly.

Here's what I know:

1. I've had a hand-loose battery cable lately. After the bus died the first
time, I had to run around back in traffic and twist the cable to get him to
start again. Hmmm...could I have fried the brain? (got a spare--for the
bus; not the driver.)

2. I believe I have a dying brake booster (I have a spare of unknown
quality). I have been noticing what appears to be booster-induced braking,
which would be having a negative impact on fuel economy and probably
account for the stuck brake...hot brake gets stuck in position when I set
e-brake; loosens itself when I start back 9 hours later. Hmmm...could the
diapham have given up here and be causing a massive vacuum leak (in which
case I should be able to just plug it off and drive home, right?)

3. My brake indicator light has been eradic for some time, perhaps
indicating a short, or perhaps the leak in the booster.

4. My temp sensor registered 1500 ohms or so at maybe 75 or 80 degrees F.

5. I no longer have headlights. Don't know what happened there, but I'd
guess I blew a fuse.

6. If I can't fix Fyn tomorrow without great effort, I will have him towed
to the house (providing my insurance really covers enough of the tow to
keep me from paying more than $50).

7. If towing costs more than $50, I will be imposing upon a friend with a
towbar and a pickup truck.

Any help would be appreciated. Please copy me at
jf264119_at_opus.corp.fedex_dot_com, since I'll be at work tomorrow when most of
you have the chance to respond.

Thanks! Joe
