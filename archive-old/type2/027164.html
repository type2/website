Hi Volks,
   &quot;Has any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you 
recovered from it?&quot;

    This was refering to the upper cot in the early bay window westy.  I 
have one in my 71 and that is where I sleep when camping alone.  Mind you 
now, I'm no small guy at 5'10&quot; and 232 lbs., and I feel fine up there.  The 
best part is that I don't have to tidy things up downstairs before I can go 
to sleep.
