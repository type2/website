Subject: Re: [T2] Help on the rubber 

Hi Chris,

The easiest way to fit the sliding door seal is to undo the two bolts that hold the rear sliding hinge mechanism onto the door (these are to be seen from INSIDE of the bus just below the window).
Then with the door ajar, WHILE SUPPORTING THE DOOR (bloks, axle stand, jack, helper...), pull the hinge mechanism out, pop the seal through the gap, slide the hinge back into the door.
In my experience this is much easier than removing the track cover and takeing the slider off of the track.

Good luck

&gt; I just installed new rubber on the front doors &amp; back hatch (71westy). Front 
&gt; worked well but for the left side needs a good slam to close, hope this well 
&gt; get better well time.
&gt; 
&gt; Now to the slider. Do I have remove the door to get the seal in place?  This 
&gt; will be some work, so if I can avoid this I would like to.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, for your help.
