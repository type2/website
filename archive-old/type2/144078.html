Subject: Sanding / Repainting Ceiling

Hey guys,

       I'm planning on re-doing my interior. When I got my car, it was stripped. There are no interior panels, it's just a totally stripped shell inside. There seems to be a buildup of adhesive and a little bit of surface rust. 

The car was recently repainted, and there is a little bit of body work (some bondo) around the door sills where rust through was repaired. My Bus is garaged 24/7, 356 days a year, so I don't worry about re-occuring rust. However, I'm worried about repainting the inside. Typically when I repaint sheet metal, I use a paint stripping disc (those 3M scrubbing disks) and sometimes I use a sanding wheel. The sheet metal on the roof of the Bus seems to be fairly thin and I'd just like to hear from anyone who has done this. I'm worried that if I use a scrubbing wheel, or a sanding disc, that it could cause my paint to chip (or burn) on the other side of the panel (the roof).

Anyone have any idea? Or am I just being too paranoid?


Thanks!

Todd
