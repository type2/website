&gt;  A place named Reborn Parts has told me they have them, provided
&gt; that the ports are oval, which a fellow listee had written to me that
&gt; they are.  But before I can order them they want the part number and I
&gt; have no idea what that is or where to find it.  Do the old parts need to
&gt; be removed to get this info?

The part # is not on the old part. I can give you the # of the right one,
021 251 552. But the left one is no longer listed in the parts fische. This
is oval port and fits 75 to 78.
