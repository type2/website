I just had to replace this and used the kit... the pin that holds the cage, 
bushings to the shift rod came with a lag bolt to keep it in place.  For the 
life of me I couldn't get the bolt to &quot;catch&quot; in the pin, and just wasted 
the first of the coarse threads on the bolt.  I ended up putting baling wire 
through the pin and doing a twistie number to it to make sure it stays in 
place, but does anyone have a solution to what this lag bolt is all about?? 
Did I have it all wrong?  Did I get the wrong part?
Also, Grant, what did you mean, &quot;safety wire&quot; the set screw?  TIA...

&gt;&gt;Don't forget to safety wire the set screw when you're done.
