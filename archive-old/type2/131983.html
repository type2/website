&gt; i had to take the pipe off my tank and stick the rubber boot on and get a few

That's how I put them on. I pull the flange through then then rotate the
pipe so the holes for the screws line up and there is no stress of the neck.
This time around I also rubbed in a rubber preservative.

&gt; is the one from the depot the same thickness as the one you got ...?

My original came from BD, yes.

&gt; this one i got seems alot thicker than that of the old that came out of it...

The flange seems thicker to me but that's all. The shape overall is
different.
