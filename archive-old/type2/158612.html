Subject: oil filters and oil

what is the best oil and weight  to  use in a hot and humid climate?   i
live in georgia and it gets really hot and humid here. the engine is the
2.0L .   i bought a wix filter from the local oreily store and have yet to
put it on.   some of the articles i have great give me a little trepidation
and reservation in using it.   i have a wix air filter too.  bad idea or
not?
