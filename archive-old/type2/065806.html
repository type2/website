Subject: Fuel Leak

Dear all,

I wonder if anyone can offer me advice on a fuel leak I have.

Yesterday I noticed a patch of fuel under my van, it was dripping from
the bottom of the fuel pump, and the fuel line from the tank to the
pump was soaked.  I replaced the fuel line from tank to pump last night,
and cleaned up the surrounding area.

Today after a long run I again noticed fuel under the van, about a dozen
drops in a hour or so.  On further inspection the line from tank to pump
was dry as a bone aswell as the line to the carbs.  Infact the fuel was not
dropping from the flange where the two halves of the pump join, (where it
had been dropping from before), and the pump was dry itself. The fuel was
dripping from the flange between the pump and the main block, and was also
dripping off the low point where the engine is bolted to the transaxle.

The overflow pipe from the fuel pipe was soaked aswell, but I am not sure if
I cleaned this up last night , after the leak from the tank/pump line had been
fixed.

Thankyou in advance.
