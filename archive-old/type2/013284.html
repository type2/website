&gt; Need a low dough cruiser until you hit the Lotto? Want
&gt; something that won't hurt if it gets confiscated but
&gt; solid enough to tour with this Summer? Have you
&gt; recently lost your job acting on Ally McBeal? This bus
&gt; is for you! Driven home over the weekend. Engine
&gt; plucked- you get the rest. Good canvas, complete
&gt; interior, needs your motor, major cleaning, center pin
&gt; and one ball joint &lt;2 balljoints come with bus&gt;. Paint
&gt; is appropriate for the price. Stop by the Ace Hardware
&gt; and pick out what color you want it to be. =) Floors
&gt; and rockers are solid and not rusty. All doors shut
&gt; fine. **Excellent** to toss an engine into and cruise
&gt; it for a low dough thumper. F-orget that show car
&gt; swill. This is the real deal!
&gt; (480) 891-5083 Mon-Fri or email. Arizona Bus Club
&gt; discount or anyone with Franklins.
