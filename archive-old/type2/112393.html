Subject: Re: [T2] Plasti dip update

I put new pads in my Bus yesterday and while I was under there I saw the
bleeder screws were nice and shiny under the caps but the rest was as
rusted as can be expected...I had a bunch of new ones so I decided to change 
them as well...Then the thought hit me that they'd be rusting too...So, with
the rubber cap ON, I slathered a full coat of Plasti dip over the cap and the 
bleeder screw, let it dry and added another coat.
We'll see how this protects the new bleeders from rusting, but anything to
preserve those precious 'flats' from rusting and the threads, couldn't hurt...
