I finally desided to jump in on this one.  Reason being, I recently
purchased a 1970 Westy from the second owner with only 56K miles.  The
second owner bought it from the origianl owner in 1980 and stored it in a
warehouse from then until I bought it.  Who knows why, he was a car
collector so I guess he had diverse taste.

Regardless, the camper needed / needs nothing other than dusting off and
maybe some new tires, although they all are still holding the same air I
put in them months ago.

For &quot;preventive maintenance's&quot; sake, I am replacing all the brake hoses,
wheel cyls, etc with all German parts that I already have sitting in the
Westy and I had the heads rebuilt.  While the motor is out, I am flushing
the gas tank, replacing the CV boots, packing the CVs, etc.  Again, just
preventive maintenance.  I drove it the day I bought it, and on a few short
adventures around the neighborhood after I got it home (no insurance).  The
pisser is that he told me he had the tent.  What he had is some vinyl
tarp-ish thing with snaps on it.  I will post pics on my website and give
an &quot;atta-boy&quot; to anyone who can identify it.  There are two pieces with a
half zipper on the sides of each so that the two pieces can zip together.
It is probably not even VW, but I can't figure out what it came from.
ANYWAY...

Rust?  Not a morsel.  None.

I paid and have in the Westy nowhere NEAR $10,500, nor would I.  In fact,
if someone who believes in paying that price wants to give me half that
($5250), you've got yourself a beautiful Westy. ;-)

Pictures are on my website if you are interested.  URL is in my .sig.

Have a good day!
Derrick
