I wondered where all the rest of them went.  I found all 10 of these 
and brought them to the attention of the list to make a group purchase.  
Then they started disappearing...  Myself and two honorable list 
members each purchased one, and these guys obviously got the rest.  
The two other list members have both passed theirs on to yet another 
list member.

Either we got REALLY good deals or alt-energy_dot_com is looking for quite 
a profit margin.  Double sliders sold for $750 and single sliders went 
for $500.
