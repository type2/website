Subject: Removing Seats

Hello all

Just a quick question

I have a 71 westy and I'm looking to put in new seats.  I've found two
captain seats that are coming out of a vangon(not sure the year) and I
was wondering if they will fit??  Also, the seats in the vangon rotate,
and I've been having a hard time trying to get them out.  Any
suggestions???

Thanks

Jeff
