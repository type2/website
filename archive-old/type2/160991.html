It depends on your multimeter. Around 70F is 0mV and when the engine  
is hot the reading might be about 4mV.

&gt; I would like to test the sending unit. I
&gt; am assuming that it will be almost a dead short with only the wire  
&gt; length
&gt; offering resistance if I tested it with an ohm meter?

If there is no current then you'll read about 70F but I don't think  
you can read that on the gauge and know for sure that it's working.
