Subject: 78 gas gauge erratic readings

Just wondering if someone could give me a rundown on the gas guage
system, and how it's all supposed to work.  My gas guage has been
giving erratic readings--sometimes reading completely full, sometimes
reading completely empty, when the tank is actually about 1/2 full.
Seems to be dependent on the car's motion, too--a long sweeping
curve to the left will leave the gauge down in the reserve, while
a long curve to the right will leave it up on the full mark.

How important is the orientation of the sender in the tank?  What's
the purpose of that little sort-of container inside the gas tank, and
does it have any relation to the sender's operation?

I know that shorting the sender wire to ground results in a full
reading, and that if the gauge is broken, it won't read at all.
Obviously the gauge works--I guess the full readings could be an
intermittent short, but I wanted to know if there's anything else that
could be the problem.  My tank is kinda funny shaped--bent by some PO
who apparently wanted to replace the sender without removing the tank
- -OR- cutting into the cargo deck--so the sender doesn't &quot;hang straight
down&quot; the way it normally would.  What effect might this have?

Thanks,
Rodney
