Subject: Re: [T2] brazil kombis

One variation that I have heard is that VW will transfer the tooling 
and production of the T4 Transporter to VW do Brasil. The T4 will 
replace the the T2 based Kombi.  The T5 went on sale in European 
markets this past summer as the last of the T4 were being produced at 
the same time.
