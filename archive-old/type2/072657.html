This was in my newspaper--  Just thought some of you might be interested in
reading it.  (Tom &amp; Ray is a vehicle Q&amp;A in the paper)

Dear Tom &amp; Ray,
I was thinking of buying a Volkswagen Microbus.  I know that means constant
repairs, etc.  But I currently drive a 1987 Jetta with 166,000 miles that
also needs constant repairs.  So I figured if I'm going to be repairing my
car all the time, I might as well have a cooler car.  I'm graduating from
high school soon, and I plan on going to college next year.  What do you
think?-Nick

Ray: Well, if you're looking for a cooler car, you can't beat an old VW
Microbus.  Their heaters were so inefficient that you're guaranteed to be
cool all winter- assuming you don't freeze to death.

Tom: Of course, the major downside of the VW Microbus is not its lack of a
good heater.  It's not the lack of power, either.  Nor is it the way it
blows around in the wind like a billboard on top of Mount Washington. No.
The big problem with Microbuses is safety.

Ray:  Before you buy one, try this experiment, Nick.  Take a folding chair
out to your driveway and have a friend drive his car into your knees.
That'll give you an idea of what it will feel like to have a front-end
crash in an old VW bus.  The engine's in the back.  And you sit so far up
front in that vehicle that your knees basically ARE the front bumpers.  Not
literally, but pretty close.

Tom: So if you really was a VW bus, atleast get a Eurovan, the
later-generation, front engine, front-wheel drive VW buses.  Those are
considerably safer.

Ray: Or, if you want something old &amp; funky, consider going for something
big- like a '70s Chevy Suburban or my brother's late '74 Chevy Caprice
Classic Convertible.  Something like that will be every bit as lousy,
smelly and unreliable as a VW bus, but atleast there will be alot of metal
around you if you should hit something.  Good luck, Nick.
