Hi Dave,

It would seem to me that the interior space of a big rig with a  
sleeper is pretty close to the interior space of a baywindow or  
Vanagon. Which is probably why the current line of espar heaters are  
targeted at the big rigs.

The only difference I can think of is that with a big rig it isn't as  
hard to find a place to locate the 5HP engine, etc.
