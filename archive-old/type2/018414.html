Hi Ray,

I have the same problem and in the current (June 1999) copy of NASA Tech
Briefs there is an advert for:

&quot;Trim-Lock  For over 23 years, the leader in flexible plastic and rubber extrusions!&quot;

&quot;See us on-line at http://www.trimlok_dot_com&quot;

The photo shows what looks like a Riviera poptop gasket...

I haven't been to the site yet, but if you'd like I can scan the advert and
send it on to you.
