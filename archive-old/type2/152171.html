&gt; Funny enough, when I was in automotive publishing there was (and

duh, what's the difference??? isn't a horz opposed also the same as a
180degree &quot;V&quot;

of course the true horz opposed would be like the Fairbanks Morse engine
of the 40s 50s where the opposed pistons were on the same connecting rod
that was long with pistons at either end and the crank in the middle

   o-----O-----o&lt;-piston
         ^
      crank

diferent than our bus engines in which each piston has it's own
cronnecting rod,
