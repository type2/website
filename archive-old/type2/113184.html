Subject: Felt Pilot Bearing Seal and metal retaining ring/washer source

Hi All:

Anyone know where I can find a new felt sealing washer and the metal
ring that centers in in the flywheel for a type IV (2.0L). The Vanagon
part number is 021-105-311. Again Bus Depot cannot supply these (my
order was canceled). I am not sure if it is similar to the 1600 engines,
whose parts number is 111-105-311. I do not think either number includes
the metal ring that centers the felt washer. Any idea where to find one
of these?

TIA
Regards,
