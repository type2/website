Subject: Re: [VB] Now what?!? 69 bus tire/ brake issues




&gt;
&gt;I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.
&gt;
&gt;They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, 
&gt;but
&gt;what pressures should I run?
&gt;

When I had tires like those I ran the VW recomended pressure. They were 
rated for more, but I filled them to 32. They worked fine.
