Subject: RE: [T2] Brake hardware kit doesn't contain the right parts!
  ?????

Hey, Jeff Myer...

I bought a rear brake hardware kit about a year ago from a FLAPS.  Same 
deal; two sets of pins and neither set was long enough.

Since I did not have my old pins, I wound up cutting off almost half of the 
new spring to get the new brake hardware pins to fit with the new springs.

So it is not just our honored suppliers (if/when they have the kits) that 
are a bit off.
