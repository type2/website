&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many US cars have a parking brake that is a foot pedal located off to the
&gt; &gt; left side of the footwell.  You can still use it for hill starts, as the
&gt; &gt; brake release is a pull-knob.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would you *need* to use the parking brake to hill-start the car if you
&gt; have an automatic transmission?

not all cars with foot parking brakes are automatics.  They don't
change the parking brake arrangement for manual transmissions.

Luckily, my bus has a nice handy hand brake, but I tend to use the
heel-on-the-gas-toe-on-the-brake method of moving off from a stop on an
uphill.
