1. I want to restore my air ventilation like original VW. I have 1974 bus
imported to Indonesia. It's right hand drive. The engine still use 1972 VW's
(not pancake)

2. There is oil all over my engine compartement. I think it's leak from the
crankshaft pulley. There is a little leak also under the engine. Its from
the oil drainage and near gearbox,

Can you help??
