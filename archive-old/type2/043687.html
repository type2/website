spunky 1 :
yes and no. check the number on the cam gear
for the deviation , either a zero or a + or - digit,
this will work better the closer it gets to the
original, it indicates a fitment and will produce
noise the further away it gets...
and don't forget that hydraulic lifters go with
hydraulic cams, although that can be ignored as well...
