Subject: Vanagon Brake Booster

Has anyone ever replaced a brake booster in a Vanagon? I did a preliminary
survey of the area and it looks like I am going to have to remove the dash.
Bently is no help.  If anyone has done this, how long did it take?  Anything
special to remember?  I'm thinking about letting a shop do this, which would
be a first for me.  Thanks.
