Subject: doh, thrown rod

OK well I blew up my bus engine on Saturday.  time to build the stroker I
have always wanted.  I had oil pressure problems I think due to a sticky
relief piston but not really sure.  fortunately I was in the 100 mile radius
of AAA plus.  If I had tried to go to Everybus I wouldn't have made it
there.  Next engine I build will start with a NEW case.

off topic, does anyone know if it is possible to change the backup light
switch on a '67 beetle with the tranny in the car?  It looks kind of tight
in there. wrench size?

TIA,
Will Anderson
