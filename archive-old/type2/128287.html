Subject: backup motors purchased in the spur of the moment.

I picked up a 78 bus with a dead motor thinking I could have the Muir
ideal of a spare, well, most everything for my 75. Within 24 hours I
discovered 75 and 78 motors are not interchangeable. Is the tranny/motor
combo a drop in replacement, or do I have issues with the axle
interface?

Is there a good reference for a noob as to what is and what is not
swappable?

Thanks in advance,

jack
