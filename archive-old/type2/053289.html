&gt;found a cool LCD TV ($1000)



I happen to work for a large computer company that uses small LCD screens as
part of the manufacturing process. Since we order the screens directly from
the manufacturer as a spare part, I know ~we~ pay $300 for the 6 inch
screen. It comes with the rca plugs and everything, just need to build a
&quot;housing&quot; to mount it in. Unfortunately, I don't have the means to purchase
anything through my company. Even at $300 its a little steep for me. I would
guess over time these units will drop drastically just like VCR's have.

Bus content: I recently scored new &quot;arms&quot; for controlling the vents and
heat. I have yet to pull the four screws holding the dash on, is there
anything I should know before I go for it?
