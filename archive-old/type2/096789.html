Subject: water accumulation in front panel

Hello everybody; 

I recently noticed that water is accumulating in the (particularly) very
right front edge of my '71 Westy - after rains/washing car, etc., it has a
tendency to hold water and then it slowly leaks/drips out - it's
especially noticeable if it is parked with the nose downhill, then the
water drips out fairly fast. However, I assume that this is a bad thing -
it seems to hold water for much too long, and it is an obvious rust
hazard. 

Is there a drain plug that is clogged? Something I'm missing? I checked
around under the front panel, but I couldn't see anything in particular. 

Thanks for your help, as usual 

Cheers
