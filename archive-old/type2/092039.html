Subject: Where's this oil coming from?

Friends,

My '70 loaf is running great, but I'd like to find out where this oil is
coming from.  Under the horn on my air-cleaner there is some oil
dampness that I can't explain.  It's on the weighted-lever thingie
between the air-inlet horn and the air-cleaner canister, and it's
oil-damp generally on the tin between the oil-filler and the #2 plug.

I'm pretty sure it's not coming from the filler neck, but it looks like
it might be coming out of the air cleaner.  I know there is oil in that
thing, but is it likely for the oil in the canister to leak down the
tube?

Oh, one other thing.  I just realized that the sump-plate is not held on
with little bolts but with studs and cap nuts.  When I have been taking
mine off, the stud comes out with 5 of the six cap nuts.  Anyone know
where I can get replacement studs and cap-nuts for the sump plate?

Thanks
