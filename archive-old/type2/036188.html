To any interested early camper fans,

A 61 camper van has appeared for sale two blocks from my home.  SE Portland, 
OR $4000 OBO. The posted number is 503 723-5450.

I don't know much about these early buses but it looks to be pretty complete, 
in good clean condition, with current plates.  Some dings, extra holes, some 
rust in the rockers.

Original (I think) pinkish red paint

1/2 length white metal roof rack

3 opening, screened windows on the driver side, 1 in each door on the 
passenger side

sapphire III in the dash

&quot;deep sump&quot; oil reservoir

Does NOT have correct tail lites
