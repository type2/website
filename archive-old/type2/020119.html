Subject: gas storage

I don't think this is a real possibility, the amount of heat the can
would be
exposed to would be pretty low.  In that position it is under the
airscoop and
on the cool side of the engine (the top, remember the tin is to keep the
hot
bottom air separate from the cool top air).  The buses gas tank is
located
right above the tranny and is probably exposed to the same amount of
heat that
a can in this location would get.  At most the engine compartment
probably gets
to 150 degree F . I don't remember  the temperature at which gas becomes

spontaneously ignitable but i am certain it is higher than that. (if i
had my
risk assessment guide handy i could look it up) The only possible threat
i can
think of is if you had an engine fire from another source but then again
the 14
gallons in the tank would be a bigger concern.  If it did get hot enough
to
cause a spontaneous gas fire then fuel lines would be igniting all the
time(even if they aren't old and leaky) and gas tanks exploding would be
a real
threat. As long as the can is completely sealed an not venting gas
vapor(now
that IS amazingly explosive) it should be no problem.
of course, i'd do it but i take no responsibility for those who do ;-)
A heat shield of aluminum flashing to block radiant heat might ease ones
mind
if they were concerned though
in summation: this is not a significant hazard in my opinion as long as
the can
is well sealed
good luck on whatever solution you find
Jamie
maybe a chemical engineer or physicist or something on the list can give
us a
more conclusive answer



&gt; In reference to the one gallon can on the driver's side battery tray
in the
&gt; engine compartment, wouldn't this expose it to too much heat and
greatly
&gt; increase the risk of fire/explosion?  Does anyone else do this or even

&gt; thought of this?
