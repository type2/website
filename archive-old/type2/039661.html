Hi,

 I am not going to argue with you.
 Your post suggests to me that your knowledge of electrical engineering
is less than comprehensive but we seem to agree that a large increase 
in load will likely require a corresponding upgrade to the generator 
and wiring.

 I don't know what your references to firearms are intended to show,
nor why you feel it necessary to preach so aggressively. If you
want the last word, by all means have it, but please lighten up on
people who are new to the list: after all todays VW-guru is yesterdays
&quot;can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; newbie.

Cheers,
	 W.
