&gt;What problems did you find with them?

None personally. Just documenting what's out there.

&gt;The box says Mexico 
&gt;and the Coil says Spain.

Ron Salmon might be able to sort out that mess.

&gt;&gt;1. Rotor Button  Bosch #04012
&gt;
&gt;&gt;009 rotor. Get 04033 instead.
&gt;
&gt;About the rotor button, do you know of any reasons why it will not work? Or 
&gt;if it will work but could lead to damage later?

I don't think it fits, right?

I changed the rotor on my neighbors lotus a couple of weeks back. There was metal dust all over the inside of the distributor. It turned out that the PO had put in the wrong rotor and it had ground down the terminals in the cap as it spun. The shaft didn't seem wobbly and I was surprised the damage wasn't worse.
