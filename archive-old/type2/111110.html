Subject: bus shakes at 35mph

got my bus running, well sorta i guess.

man this sure isnt like driving my notchback...

Is there something else other than it needing new
tires (these are thrashed and been sitting for 7yrs.)
that will cause the bus to almost shake itself apart?

the bus wont idle, pops and frankly just runs like
crap, I had the carb apart perhaps the big screw that
you adjust isnt set like it was, i dont know. there
also a smaller screw next to that one that maybe i
also didnt adjust back to how it was.
