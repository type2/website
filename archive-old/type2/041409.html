Subject: new 2.0 liter engines

I have VW factory rebuilt 2.0 liter engines available outright (no core
return req'd) from VW South Africa. Comes with a new German oil cooler
and warranty. If interested, please email direct at peterb_at_tiico_dot_com or
visit our web page http://www.tiico_dot_com for more info.

In addition to this, I will have available brand new 2.0 liter cases and
possibly brand new long blocks with new German cylinder heads. Probably
the last ever of these cases as they are no longer being produced.
