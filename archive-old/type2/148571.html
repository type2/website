Subject: Chirping exhaust

HI,

A situation I've noticed for a while but haven't been able to pin down.

My exhaust makes a chirping noise. Its a 1600dp with stock exhaust.

Cool at idle sounds good. At hot idle I get a put put put put - chirp
- put put put - chirp sound. Also when on the highway at varying RPM's
and loads I get a constant chirping. Usually, when cruising,  if I
back my foot of the gas a bit the chirping will stop.

Valves have just been adjusted and the problem is the same.

I'm sure its coming from the exhaust. With respect to chirping the
archives suggest re-torquing the heads down. I will take a shot at
this soon but I don't have time or space to pull my engine right now.

She idles a bit high - around 11-1200 RPM. Could the problem be
something simple - like I just need to re-tune the carb. (Solex
34PICT3 with 132.5 main). I'm considering putting the 127.5 jet back
in.

I'm thinking perhaps uncombusted fuel is entering the hot exhaust and
burning off?

I'm going to go check my dwell and timing while my engine is still
warm, then when it cools I will recheck the valves.

In the meantime, I'd love to hear what you folks think.

Thoughts, ideas, suggestions?

thanks
peace!
