Subject: 72 Bus Front Suspension

Hi All,

I am new to this list as I am helping a friend bring a 72 Westy back from the 
dead after sitting for about 5 years.  After getting it running the other day 
we moved it up the driveway and a dip in the driveway to the left caused the 
driver's side of the bus in the front to pitch down hard.  It seemed to stay 
down until we hit a higher part of the drive and it seemed to &quot;pop back up&quot;  
Don't know how else to put it.  Seems I can push down somewhat on the drivers 
side and it stays down a bit but the passengers side come right back to normal 
ride height.  Considering it was sitting that long, could the needle bearings 
or something else in the suspension be sticking?  Hoping it is not a broken 
leaf.  Any thoughts?

Thanks

Ray
