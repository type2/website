Subject: Spark Plugs

I use W8BC plugs in my 1776, they have the same heat range 
as stock VW yet they have a so-called 'protruding electrode' 
(if that really is what it's called) and thus stick a little 
further into the combustion chamber, closer to the piston. 
Another advantage of using these is that they are often still 
German made, instead of in Spain or India. I feel that there 
is a significant quality difference between German and non-
German made Bosch plugs. The threads and the way the mass 
electrode is welded-on on the non-German ones is just not 
as nice as on the German made ones. 

W7BC plugs are &quot;colder&quot; they get rid of heat quicker than a 
plug with a higher number. A spark plug has an ideal operating 
temperature. At this tempature it is happy and it will burn 
clean without overheating and crack or melt. Going to a colder 
plug like the W7BC may be a good thing if your Bus runs hotter 
than usual for some reason, and may provide longer plug life in 
such a case. It will reach its operating temperature in an engine 
where a W8AC would be overheating. I don't know for which 356 the 
W7BC is off the top of my head, as the correct plug for my '62 
Super 90 was the W5DC. A colder plug gets rid of heat quicker, 
whereas a hotter plug gets rid of heat less fast. 

The legend to the two letters after the number in a Bosch 
plug number are as follows: 

			W 8 A C 

	First letter after number:
		A: shorter, non-protruding electrode
		B: longer, protruding electrode

	Second (last letter) after number:
		C: short threads
		D: long threads

Aircooled VW plug threads are M14x1.5mm.
