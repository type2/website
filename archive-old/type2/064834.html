&gt; I just picked up an indoor/outdoor digital temperature gauge from Radio
&gt; Shack - great deal at 10 bucks on sale... it even has a light!  I'd like to
&gt; run this 1.5 volt device from the car battery if possible, but I can't
&gt; remember how to do this.  Is it as simple as using V=IR to find an
&gt; appropriate size resistor to put inline with the circuit?  I don't think I
&gt; have to worry about heat buildup or power loss in this application, since
&gt; the current used is miniscule in this application.  I just want something
&gt; that will work.
&gt; 
&gt; I also picked up two 12V LED's to light another digital thermometer.  I
&gt; bought this dual-display unit (hehehe, he said &quot;unit&quot;) from Radio Shack
&gt; last year but it doesn't have a light.  The only color they had was red -
&gt; should look great at night!
&gt; 
&gt; When I get done, I hope to have indoor and outdoor backlit temperature
&gt; displays in the dash, and a third backlit display (the new one) to show
&gt; temperature inside the fridge, which I have found to be VERY useful.  I
&gt; want them all to run on 12V so I don't have to mess with changing the
&gt; batteries, and I want them to light up with the rest of the gauges at
&gt; night.   Yeah, I want it all - so sue me.  :)

FWIW, 
You should try out a very good electronics store (aka NOT Radio Shack!). 
Ask for a voltage regulator that will step down 12 volts DC to 1.5 volts 
DC. I know 12v to 9v are available, etc. but 1.5 v is pretty small. The 
device you are looking for will have three little legs for soldering 
connected to an approximately 1cm square chip. Its backside will be metal 
so you can attach a heat sink to it. Just a thought...
