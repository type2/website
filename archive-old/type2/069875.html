hey now,

this weekend i went to Best Buy to return a modem so that i could have some $$$
for bus related stuff (sad ain't it? :-) ) anyways, i get back in the van
and turn the ignition and nothing happens. nada. zilch. first thought..battery
dead? nope, brand new battery. lights go out when ignition is turned. i realize
right then my worst nightmare. i had none, nada, nichts in the way of tools. i
reloaded my van since the rebuild. hmmm, i do have hayes tho. hehehe. so i set
out to see what i could do. every wire was in its place. no loose connections.
i was afraid to pop the clutch cuz i didn't know if that would work if i had an
electrical problem. so i tried to get a jump start.

the scene: lower 90's. high humidity. long hair hippy type with grease on hands
holding jumper cables. a large superstore parking lot with people walking by
and driving at the rate of 10 per 30seconds.

i ask the first person i see, who happens to be parked next to me, for a quick
jump. he's to busy. got stuff to do. i shrug my shoulders. ask the next person.
doesn't want to mess up his nice lexus giving a vw a jump start. (i gathered
that from his incredulous you-must-be-kidding look). anyway the 10 person i
asked were two 20'ish redneck males driving a pickup truck with many
confederate battle flags on it. (people don't realize that this flag is not
the confederate flag, per se, but a battle flag and battle flags are retired
when in defeat. you don't fly them. anyways i digress again). apart from
flags these were nice folks. jumped me right up...as in battery jumping. dude
said he used to have a vw. i thanked him profusely. nice guy.

well, to show my love to the parking lot i took out the grateful dead tape i
had been listening to and threw in a Smashing Pumpkins tape and cranked it.
i got some stares on the way out! hippy looking van with this rowdy music? hehe

anyways, can anyone suggest what might be wrong with the ignition system?

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Rummm...Rummm...RuMbA!)

ps. since yesterday i haven't had a problem cranking up the van. every now and
then it will click...then start.
