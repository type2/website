Thought I'd take the Friday opportunity to thank Rick Dennis, Rick Taylor, 
Steve White, and whoever else had a hand in organizing and hosting the Dam 
campout on Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri last weekend.  Was great to put a 
face to some names (and some names on some faces/busses from prior BBTA).  
Weather and location was beautiful, and Rick Taylor and Steve whip a mean 
dinner!
