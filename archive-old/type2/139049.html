&gt; I've used California Imports for perhaps 2 dozen

I've always received what I've expect in terms of quality and description
except once.

What I don't like about CIP is that if you call and ask who makes part X
they have no idea and rarely will pull one from the shelf to inform you.

I still think it's a good business.
