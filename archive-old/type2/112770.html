Hey folks, I got my 79 camper 2.0L GE running tonight and it purrs like
a kitten.  Reground crank, rebuilt heads, new bearings, new pistons and
cylinders, new cam and new lifters.  Had to do it almost twice because
the first time I cranked it, a head was leaking.  I took it back apart
monday, installed the head shims (gaskets, whatever they're called)
spent the better part of last nite trying to crank it and finally put in
a new condenser today.  It fired right up, idles beautifully, doesn't
tap, doesn't leak and doesn't skip.  Many thanks to the friends here on
the list who gave me advice.  It was all very helpful!  This group of
folks is wonderful!  Greg
