&gt; Have been experimenting with timing. Retarding seemed to make it

&gt; 38 BTDC. Tonight I adjusted to 16 to 40, so I will see if that helps.
&gt; I started out at 6 to 30, tried 3 to 27, even tried some ATDC. So lets
&gt; see where that gets me.

what distributor do you have, the infamous 009 or the actual vacuum dist
that belongs in the van...??

&gt; I might look into valves again. Compression is now much lower than
&gt; when I first installed the engine a little while ago. I've adjusted
&gt; twice. I am afraid #1 intake is dropping or strechting as the valve
&gt; touches the adjuster inside the rocker arm, so it is difficult to
&gt; adjust accurately. When I had the head off, I didn't notice anything
&gt; wrong with the valve or seat though.

well something is wrong and you can fix the head or you can fix an entire
engine...

&gt; Thanks for the suggestions.

&gt;  if regular high octane gas isn't enough it isn't the compression or octane
&gt;  that is your problem.
&gt;
&gt;  check you have the timing right
&gt;  check your valves
&gt;  check your spark plug wires
&gt;  check you points
&gt;  check your distributor cap
&gt;
