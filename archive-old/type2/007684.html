Subject: Main Seal Leak?
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 10:21:32 PST

I'm thinking about buying a '78 Riviera conversion. It leaks oil pretty 
bad on the bottom of the engine. If I run my hand across it, it gets 
soaked in oil. Is there any way I can tell for sure if it is the main 
seals leaking or if it is the push rod tube seals that are leaking (or 
maybe something else) Any help is very much appreciated. I don't want to 
buy something that's going to have big problems. Thanks.
                       Simon
 

Also: Sorry about the repeated posting of the (supposably) '78 
Winnebego. Didn't mean for that to happen, was having problems with my 
computer. Turns out the Winnebego conversion was really a Riviera 
Conversion that's missing the stove/fridge unit. (any info on where to 
get this would be great)
