Subject: :-&lt;   Poor ole Folly

Chuck the Canadian, was over to have a look at Folly's type iv motor last 
night.  Chuck was a professional mechanic.  He raised one connecting rod, 
felt it move, looked at me and said the crank was finished.  &lt; He used 
another f word &gt;  We then took off numbers one and two rods and on two 
the insert had actually overlapped itself anf fused to the crank.  Number 
1 was better, but still kacked.    

So rather then pay the expense of having the crank reground, there a 73 
engine connected to a 73 parter that's available for $CDN200.00.  

I'll keep the bit and pieces though... 

Thanks all...  I'll let you know how the 73 parter turns out!
