Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust sensor - do I need it for my CA fuel injection
  system

Hi Andrew,

My Dad converted his 82 CA-spec westy to the 72-74 style exhaust last 
summer.

It runs OK without an O2 sensor, but fuel economy suffered about 10%. 
In the course of a year that would have paid for it many times over. 
And if you're subject to emissions testing in DC I would be surprised 
if it passed without it.

A single-wire sensor will have to be mounted in the heater box in order 
to ensure it gets heated to the correct temperature, but a more 
expensive heated sensor can be mounted in the tailpipe if you prefer 
not to drill the heater box pipe.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; there is a sensor that connects to my wiring harness
&gt; that is literally screwed into the exhaust system just
&gt; before the catalytic converter.  I am transfering my
&gt; emissions over to an earlier no CA model exhaust - do
&gt; I need the exhaust sensor to be connected to run
&gt; right? if so, i will have to drill in a hole in my
&gt; exhaust pipe.
