Subject: '78 won't turn over - Ft Belvoir VA

For the past week, the '78 FI stick 2.0 liter USA Westy was struggling to
start.  It got worse and worse, until this afternoon, it was almost choking
itself to get some rotations.  I almost got caught at the gas pumps on Ft
Belvoir Virginia.

Well, it is now across from the chapel on Ft Belvoir, and it just will not
turn over, i. e., the engine will not rotate.

I tried a battery pack, but that did absolutely zilch.  I thought it was
because the portable  battery  pack was neglected and low on charge.

I called the wife and I tried to jump the '78 with jumper cables.  Nothing.
The VW (engine) would not rotate.

Now here is the FIRST HINT that may give some ideas: I could NOT generate a
spark when scraping the ground jumper cable on notorious good ground spots
on the VW.  Wife's positive post battery cable attached to the VW battery
positive post, and the wife's negative cable attached to a VW ground away
from the battery = NOTHING!!

I could click the VW side jumper cables together while the other sides were
attached to other car, and get fourth of July sparks!!  But when I attached
the positive cable to the VW battery terminal, and the negative able to the
VW ground, I get nothing.  Not even a confirmation spark.

All this while the electrical hot air fan is blowing in the engine bay, so I
know I have enough of a circuit to run the basics.

SECOND HINT: My cheater wire from the starter solenoid to the engine
compartment would get a decent spark when I pressed the bare end to the
positive battery terminal, but I got NO activity from the starter.  No sound
of the solenoid kicking over....

Wait a minute!!  Could that be it!!  My starter solenoid went South!!  I
have a spare starter/solenoid, so should I do a swap..  I would do this at
home for Sh!^s and Giggles, but the VW is dead on a military base.

If it is the solenoid, can I just push start it and drive home without any
problem??

And if it IS the starter solenoid, why couldn't I get a spark from the
jumper cable grounding??

Opinions...???,,,,????
