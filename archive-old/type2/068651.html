&gt; I thought those holes were there to let the water out! Now I got
&gt; something else to fix ;&gt;)

i always enjoyed the sight of the small animals passing under my 
feet...and, unlike mom's 63 falcon, or my friends nowscraped 75 super, 
KNOWING that the seat wont fall out!! and if your foot pokes
