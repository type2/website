Subject: Re: bad karma to a listee?

Craig,

I have a bumper for my '69. It's a bit smooshed in the
middle, but could easily be repaired. It also has the
holes for the bumper guards (sorry, I'm keeping
those;-).

Take a look at it at my web-site (URL under my name)
and see if you're interested. If so, I will pull it
and put my replacement on (might take me a week to get
it done though) and send the old one to you. If the
picture's not good enough in detail, lemme know, I can
send you a larger one....


PS-careful where you point that bad-karma gun; they
tend to backfire!
