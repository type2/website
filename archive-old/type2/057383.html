Pouring rain, dark, mosquitos the size of sparrows. My wife needs the bus
tomorrow. Tuned up Sunday ran great but the air filter was in the other bus
(back seat). Got air cleaner put it on and knocked almost every hose off the
engine. There is a protrusion from the right side of the engine almost right
under the air filter housing. It is the only thing I can't find a hose to put
on. Bus runs but Idles poorly. While I eat dinner and look through all my
manuals for diagrams and pictures, can some one tell me what goes on there?
Looks like it goes into the engine like a breather hose or something. Last
chance to save my wifes day. Thanks. Or at least point to the right page #, I
have most  manuals. ......Johnny
