&gt; &gt; Muir says it's bad for the ECU to jump-start a FI engine.  Is

&gt; ???  been doing it to and from my 78 for years not reccomending but Muir
&gt; isn't always right???
&gt;
&gt; YMMV

I've also done this many times with my '79 Cal without problems.  I don't
see why jumping is any more likely to damage the ECU than disconnecting and
connecting the battery.

Cheers,
Alistair
