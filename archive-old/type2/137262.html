Subject: Re: Temp fix for shot CV boots-works

Don- first check the goodness of your current cv's- how long do you know
for sure they have been on in miles?  How long  has the grease been
slinging out? If a lot, you could force some grease in there using the
needle attachment.  Grab the axle near each boot and try to determine if
there is any play PERPENDICULAR to the axle direction- in out will be
lots.  Twisting back and forth you may feel a little.  Test a number of
places, always push pulling in the perpendicular plane.  If you felt
almost no play, you can get away with this: I have done it-
   Most fixes sling off in a few miles- the cv is too narrow where it
rides (trying to twist a wire on there to hold anything even makes the
twist likely hit the side) and the boot metal edge is a problem- 
Jack up the bus and use stands so you can rotate the wheel. Clean the cv
side edge and boot edge from below with solvent as you spin the wheel so
you could lick it and taste nothing but steel. Gumout followed by
acetone is good. Get that edge of boot clean also. The ideas is to get a
layer of plastic from a HD garbage bag onto this.  Use ALUMINUM DUCT
TAPE from Home Depot; it is very sticky- but will come off if any
dirt/grease remains on the cv.  Now cut your  plastic bag so its width
is the distance from about midway of this tape down to the axle where
you can later tape it in place.  About 9&quot; I think.  Make it long enough
to fully go around the cv at least 1.5 times.  Now attach a layer of the
aluminum tape to the side of this piece of plastic so it extends beyond
the edge about 1&quot; or the amount of the cv side exposed.  Try not to
touch the sticky side left over.  Get under the bus and place the tape
over the cv side and have someone rotate the wheel FOWARDS so you can
stick the tape to the steel and spiral the plastic around the axle. 
This is the secret- you need help for this. The &amp;_at_%&amp;% edge of the boot
you just have to overlip and press hard onto the cv. The other side you
tape with cloth duct tape around the axle (tape loose enough so it can
slide as a tube up and down the axle).  Since  the axle is hanging is at
its maximum travel anyway, the slack needed should be present.  Aluminum
tape sticks well, but has little resistance to edge puncture, so now use
cloth duct tape or stretchy plastic tape if you can find it in a wide
version, spiraling it tight over the aluminum on the cv side as some one
rotates the wheel forward -overlap the tape over the cv edge as you go-
then keep spiraling more loosely over the bag-you don't have to overlap
the tape further down, this just strengthens the plastic so the grease
does not sling out or water easily gets in.  The idea is to keep out
dirt and the grease in.  Think I managed a whole winter this way in
Syracuse back in the 71 bus days.......
