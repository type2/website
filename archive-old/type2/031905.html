&gt; ...Can I put Vanagon seats in a '72?...

I believe so. A friend of mine put Vanagon seats in a '69 and he just 
loves 'em. The rails were the wrong distance apart and he had to 
manufacture his own, which was a pain. I understand sometime in the early 
'70's the rails went to the right distance apart and stayed that way well 
into the Vanagon years, but I can't remember which year the change was. 
Ron Salmon told me in an e-mail once, but I seem not to have saved it.

I'm shopping (not too hard) for a pair of good brown Vanagon seats for my 
'78.

I've heard that the final result of a seat swap sits about an inch higher 
than stock seats, but haven't confirmed this myself. For the very tall, 
this could be a problem. Those really into &quot;totally stock only&quot; might 
also object, but that's not me and it sounds like that's not you either.

If you want to, I say, &quot;Go for it!&quot;

Drive safely,
