Subject: Tires (again)

I hate to start this thread again, but I looked on the type2 library and found
some good info on tires, but most of these tires are discontinued. What is
everyone running on their busses now and how do they like them? The Yoko 370
LT's seemed to be the best, but not available anymore.

Thanks,
Corbett
