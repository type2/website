&gt; So after i pulled the head off of my 72 bus, i noticed that there
&gt; was this spot above cyl. 3 that had been drilled and there is a

&gt; there. 

This is the Temp Sensor II. Part of the FI system. It should be hooked
up if there is a FI system in your bus. This is not an item that can
be just disconnected if you want the bus to run well.

&gt; anyways im just guessing that this is for a temperature
&gt; sender right?? 

not the temp sender you are thinking of. Check the list vendors for
more stuff, but essentially the head temp sender and gauge are sold as
a unit and it has a ring which can be used to hook up the sender from
the spark plug, other people have bolted it directly to the head
through various ways. Then the wires are run to the front of the
bus (usually) and connected to the gauge.

&gt; well i was just curious as to what i would need to finish it and set
&gt; it up in my bus. Is there just something that vdo sells that i just
&gt; run a wire from to the front of my car?? im not sure exactly what i
&gt; would need and i am just asking you guys. sorry but i ddint have
&gt; time to think about how i would ask this question and it probably
&gt; sounds really wierd. well i just hope you guys can understand it and
&gt; can let me konw what i need. thanks

see above
