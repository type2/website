Turning the little screw in leans out the mixture.  By turning it in until
the engine stumbles you are finding the point where the mixture is just too
lean, winding the screw out one turn from that position richens the mixture
to where you want it to be (it works out that way).  To get even more fuel
economy unwind the screw even less than a full turn, just make sure the
engine isn't overheating to the lean mixture.

Good luck,

&gt; Well,  I'm trying to get some more fuel economy out of my 1970 Bus  -
stock
&gt; 1600 single-port.
&gt;
&gt; The timing seems spot on.  (Although I always feel a little insecure about
&gt; the points gap - I do it to the best of my ability, but I'd rather know
that
&gt; the dwell-angle is right - it seems so much more &quot;accurate&quot; - I don't have
a
&gt; strobe - I do mine statically - like Muir says - with a home made light.)
&gt;
&gt; I've readjusted the choke - it seems just right now - always a bit trial
and
&gt; error.  (I reckon Muir didn't have to cope with chokes - 'cause he lived
in
&gt; the toasty warm parts of the 'States.)
&gt;
&gt; But adjusting the mixture is much more tricky.  I've always read that you
&gt; should turn the screw in until the engine starts to stumble, then wind it
&gt; out by a turn.   But I'd like to know what this actually *does*...
&gt;
&gt; If I turn the screw inwards, am I making the mixture richer or leaner ???
&gt;
&gt; It's the stock Solex carb of course.  (I can't remember which version -
&gt; while I'm sat here - but I'm thinking that won't effect the answer.)
