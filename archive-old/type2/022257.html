You need to add a fuel pressure gauge that the rear seat passenger can 
watch. Try to see a pressure loss during the power loss.

Is it easy to induce?

&gt;On my FI '76 Westy, I am experencing an odd problem. The bus is losing power
&gt;every so often, and it's becoming more frequent. At first I suspected it was
&gt;electrical, like I turned the key off. But I now suspect it is fuel
&gt;related - almost seems like fuel starvation. The first thing I checked was
&gt;my fuel filter. Had an extra one, so I just changed it out. I still have the
&gt;problem. Could my fuel pump have something to do with this?
&gt;
&gt;BTW, the power loss is very brief- only twice has it actually stalled...
&gt;even then it starts right back up. Most often, though, it's at speed that I
&gt;lose power.. only for 5 seconds or so, then I'm alright.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
