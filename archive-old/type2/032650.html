Subject: 2 things to thank you for.

I can see this turning into a Spanish Inquisition sketch from Monty Python!
&quot;We have 2 things, to thank you for. NO! 3 things&quot; yada yada.

Anyway.

1. Thank you all for being such VW nuts!

2. Thanks to admin for being moody VW nuts &amp; keeping content/bandwidth in
shape. =+0

3. Thanks for the replies to the events page, keep 'em coming.

4. Thanks for keeping the cursed Oil &amp; Heating Q's to a low roar this year!

5. An extra thank you, to who ever started the fuel heating / MPG question.
It's nice to have a new Q every so often!

See I told you, ended with 5!
