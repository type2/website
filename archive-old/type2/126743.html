&gt; Fahrfergnugen!  Literally translated, &quot;Driving Fun.&quot;  A Bus is a very 
&gt; unique and enjoyable driving experience.  Few cars on the road today require 
&gt; 
&gt; such a degree of attention to the mechanical workings of the vehicle.
&gt; 

Fahrvergnugen     The only reason I know the correct spelling is that I have 
a big Neon sigh with it on there   It means the stuff that gets into your eyes 
when you are under the bus   LOL     Later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Bus
