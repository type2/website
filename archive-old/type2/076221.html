Subject: westy second battery wiring question

gents,

this is for anyone who has a factory second battery in their westy, and 
knows how it works. mine is a 1979, with what is what I THINK is a 
factory second battery. the battery was not getting charged by the 
alternator, so i needed to investigate. the battery will charge fine 
with the timer if you are connected to shore power, by the way.

tonight i was looking at things and testing voltages to try to figure 
out how it is supposed to work. in theory, i think the two batteries 
will be connected in parallel when the motor is running, allowing the 
alternator to charge the second battery. once the motor stops, the relay 
should disconnect the two batteries, so that you don't drain the main 
battery with your sony playstation at the koa...

well, i can't figure out how to make it work. maybe someone else has 
this same setup that actually works and can talk me through the right 
way to connect things.

tia,

scott lyons
