Hi Blake,


Currently the rule is this: 1973 and older vehicles are exempt. It used 
to be 65. The problem is, they change this yearly, it just depends on 
how hard those pesky enviromentalists push the issue. As for your 75 
becoming exempt, buy a 73 without an engine, transfer the parts over. 
(You catch my drift) Last I heard their were no plans as of yet to push 
the years even earlier. I think they figure that there arent alot of 
pre-73 vehicles on the road to be a problem.

Anyway.

Good luck  [:-)] 

Tyler.

1972 Westy Uh-Oh (with plans to start it tonight)

&gt;A few months ago, I had to smog my 75 westy (PITA).
&gt;Had to locate a EGR filter box and everything. Anyway,
&gt;the guy at the smog place had mentioned that all cars
&gt;72 and older are now exempt from smog requirements. I
&gt;know that the year of exemption changes from time to
&gt;time, but does anyone know what methodology the state
&gt;uses to determine the year of vehicle exemption? In
&gt;other words, Can I look forward to having my 75 exempt
&gt;in the near future?
