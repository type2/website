Subject: Westy wannabe?

Hi all,

Picked up an '81 Vanagon (still aircooled - wooohoooo!!) and it has a bunch
of camper stuff, including a pop top.  At first I thought Westfalia, but
then I started looking around and didn't see anything with the Westfalia's
name on it.  There are lots of things that tell me this conversion was done
in the states.  Like when I open the cabinets, the hinges say USA.   So my
question(s):

Were there companies other than Westfalia that did conversions?  Who were
they?  Any still around?  Did they use the Westfalia parts?  Am I stuck with
something I am not going to be able to find parts for (camping stuff)?  Any
other comments?
