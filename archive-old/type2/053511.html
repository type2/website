Subject: 71 mis UpDAtED again

    And Now,
        OK I put in new points even though the olds were fine, took the carb 
off and cleaned it up again, screwed up last time and pinched the diaphragm 
(1 hole folded over, gas was leaking....DUH!)..I thought I was using more gas 
than needed. Anyway dwell and timing and carb adjusts set and Still mis 
firing, I take her out for a drive 4 miles, sputtering, lack of power ugh, so 
I put it into neutral while coasting and romp on the accelerator for about 20 
sec, revs way high and then all of the sudden she's running fine, is there 
some sort of curse on my Westy, what will tommorow bring. Tomorrow I will do 
a compression test again....... a few months ago it was fine. Could something 
be happening when she gets really warm?????
