&gt;The reason I raised this topic is in reaction to what Joe wrote yesterday

&gt;Joe and others (Dr. Tim, for instance) do a service on the list when they 
&gt;urge us to maintain our buses in spec. But that hardly makes much 
&gt;difference if we drive them way out of spec.
&gt;
&gt;I think it's safe to say that VW buses are more specification-sensitive 
&gt;than any vehicle on the road.

Your implicit assumptions are that the Bus was engineered exclusively for 
the US market, and with minimal tolerances.  I don't believe either one of 
these assumptions is accurate.

Your explicit assumption is that VW engineered for the cars to be run only 
to the limits as set by US law.  First, the speed limit was a reaction to 
shortage of gasoline.  I don't think that law makers and engineers believed 
this to be a permanent situation, so it would not be prudent to engineer to 
this temporary restriction.

Also, speed limits in the US were held to 55 mph until some time in the 
80's.  Are you telling me that in 1985 any car manufacture was selling a 
car in the US that was only acceptable to run at speeds up to 55 mph?  Even 
a Yugo could do better than that.
