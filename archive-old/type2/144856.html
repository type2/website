Subject: Busdepot, thou hast overpackaged my grommets (non-rant)

Ron, and y'all,

I got a busdepot package yesterday, platic USPS bag, not my usual recycled
oddball box.

It was big enough to fit an ashtray or windowcranks or something.

Pulled it open, unwrapped 12 New York Times worth of newspaper and came up
with two windshield wiper grommets the size of nickels.

Checked the postage, almost seven dollars!!!

Now, I didn't pay for that postage because it was a backordered item,
obviously fired out on the quick when it became available, and I appreciate
the 'Depot's fine efforts, but Ron, you guys took it in the shorts moving my
$1.60 worth of rubber around.

Just sayin' I would've been happy with them dropped in an envelope with two
stamps.

Don't want to run the 'Depot underground on my backorders.  I'm ordering
fairly regularly now, and I've got a couple of things backordered.

Much appreciation Ron, just lookin' out for ya...

Billy
M'Boro, TN
