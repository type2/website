Hi,

&gt; Hi- VEGE UK (Chesterfield I think) do recon engines (try Just Kampers)- I'v no
&gt; personal experience with VEGE but they seem to be popular and I haven't heard
&gt; anything bad said so far !??

 I've also heard good things about VEGE rebuilds. No personal experience but the recommendation came from a very good source.

Cheers,
                W.
