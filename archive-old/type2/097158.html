Subject: Type 4 Push Rod Tube Install hints ??

Hi, just wondering if there is a trick or something in sliding the push rod
tubes on a 2 L Type 4 engine.  I noticed when I took the tubes out that the
heads side O ring seal (green one) had several sheared and now that I am
puting them on, I see why.  There is that sharp edge there, not tapered on the
head.  I tried one just working with it by hand, and never got it all the way
on, that edge was catching it and difficult to push in.  Do you use something
to gain leverage in pushing them in??   What am I missing here?? :)   Thanks!
Gerald
