Subject: Re: Bigger bed in 68-73 poptop???

Re adding better bed to 72 Westy:  Get some 1.5-2&quot; foam at a foam place,
about a 4x6ft piece.  With a little measuring and ingenuity, you can
replace the cot with a board (1/2&quot; ply, the good stuff is pretty stiff, and
you can beef up the edges) that &quot;hinges&quot; in the back and can lift up with
the top when wanted.  You can make elaborate catches in the front, or be as
simple as screwing in two eyescrews into the boards that run along the
sides of poptop and slinging a rope across that catches under board to help
lift with top. The Euopean version of the 71 I had came with a factory
Board with foam that had the rear hinges and two rubber grabbers on each
side in front.  Make a cotton cover for the foam with snaps for washability
and you will be comfy- and the mat can be used in an outside tent too.
