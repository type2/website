Subject: micrometers

&gt;Anybody know of a good, reasonably priced source for micrometers? I need one 
&gt;to check my valve stems, crank, etc.  Also in need of a dial indicator and
stand. 

Bob-

Go to your FLPS, (Friendly Local Pawn Shop) they ought to have a couple on
hand.  
If not, go to the next one down the road....

I bought mine there about 15 years ago--its a good one and has stood up well.
Beware of cheap junk at &quot;good&quot; prices in retail establishments--you will get
exactly what 
you pay for.

If the dial does not return to zero when it is completely closed, do not
worry.  
They can easily be reset by putting a 1/16th inch strip of feeler gauge
(like you adjust
your valves with) between the gear and the track and rolling the gauge open
a little.
If you find one like this, you can complain about it needing repairs, and
get the FLPS
to lower their price!

Good luck

Rick (Fabulous)
