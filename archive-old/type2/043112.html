Subject: Re: Anti-roll/Sway bar mounting

When I was removing the bushings from my sway bar, I found that a
Vise-Grip Model 12LC worked perfectly for compressing the bushing so I
could remove the clamp.  A picture of this model can be seen at:

This pup will open to 3-1/8&quot; (79mm), so it spans the bushing housing
nicely.
