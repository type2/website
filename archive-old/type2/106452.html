Subject: RE: [T2] `77 locking gas cap

&gt; I'm ready to order that new-style locking gas cap (with the 
&gt; &quot;normal&quot; looking keys). Who still has them in stock/best price, etc.?




If you want the original style chrome locking gas cap, as far as I know
I'm the only one who has them (other than the dealer, who charges
something absurd like $50). About 2 years ago, the German manufacturer
discontinued them and replaced them with a black plastic cap (functional
but not original looking). I bought all that were left of their stock at
that time and still have maybe a couple dozen left. When they're gone,
I'll only have the black plastic ones, too.  As someone else noted, even
these are not really all that secure (anyone who really wanted to pry
one off with a screwdriver could) but it's really the deterrant factor
that matters. 

Price is $15.95 . Part #  211 201 551R .
