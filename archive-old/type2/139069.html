Subject: Re: 215mm clutch cover bolts

karl writ:

&gt;A while back, someone was wanting one or more of the 7mm triple-square clutch
cover bolts that only fit the
215mm flywheel.

Not sure who it was or if they found them..... but I picked up a set of 6 of
them last Saturday.

Any one still need them?

that was me. that situation got resolved last month. all i can say is
they're hard to find. keep them in a safe place   - steve
