Subject: '78 Westy fuel injection

 Hi Everyone,
     I am still working on the fuel in oil problem. I have found that the
pressure regulator is bad and I have replaced it. I don't know if this
fixed the problem or not. While checking and testing I found that the ecu
is for a manual transmission, mine is an automatic, part # 022 906 021
AH. The ecu in the bus is part # 022 906 021 AG. Will this ecu work in
the automatic and if not does anyone have an AH ecu for sale.

        Thanks
        Ralph '78 Westy
