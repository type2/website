Subject: RE: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Hi...

Since you have the small roof opening, please . . .

   GRAFT the top section of an old VW beetle over the opening.

   For some reason, having the VW beetle face to the rear is more of a 
conversation bit than just having it ride piggy back, facing forward.

PS.  Don't forget to change the fuel lines in the VW beetle...
