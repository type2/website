Subject: engine tin and guards

Hi Guys-

(the car show last weekend was fun- and we made it back home without
breaking down.  Thanks for all your help &amp; suggestions)

Anyway, the engine is getting pulled next week to fix the oil leak.  The
mechanic asked me whether or not I wanted to replace  the shields on the
engine, or leave them off.  ???  Opinions and pros and cons, please.  Cause
I have no idea.  I would think that they were put there for a reason, and I
should have them put back on when he is done.  But maybe not.

Thanks-
Lori
