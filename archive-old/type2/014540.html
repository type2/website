Hello everyone . I was recently driving in El Paso , and while on the
highway I lost all my oil . It was all over the place and now my engine
doesn't turn :-(

I havn't pulled the engine apart yet . It's a 1600 cc single port and I had
been thinking about maybe putting in an 1835 someday . I've been looking in
VW mags and have maybe 5 prices on engines ranging from 500$ - 1000$ and all
the way up to 2000$ for turnkeys . Does anyone have any advice regarding
prices , places , do's , do nots , or anything left out ? I would really
apreciate it and look forward to hearing any and all ideas or suggestions
you may have . Thanks
