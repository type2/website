Hey,

     I have a 73' Bus   and my muffler and rear bumper are all smashed  do 
to the previous owner backing into something I'm guessing.  Anyway I am 
looking for a bolt on exaust system  my heater boxes are in great shape   so 
I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find a complete system that 
bolts to the heater boxes.  I'm not to concered with quite or high 
performance.  Although durability is a must because everything!! rusts here 
in hawaii

       thanx
        Daniel
          '73 Bus
