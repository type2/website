Subject: Mercedes Alloys on 76 Bus

I just installed a set of mid 70's Mercedes 14&quot; alloys on my bus and man is 
there a difference! The back spacing is the same and the bolt pattern. All 
you have to do to convert them for use is drill the bolt holes out to the 
size of the bus stud and install longer studs. Also, you can use your stock 
lug nuts. The difference in ride quality is definitely noticeable and they 
look great on buses. Just letting everybody know that is a choice besides 
steel wheels. These wheels are common as dirt and came on most cars from 
71-85 I think. I got my set for 80.00 at a salvage yard and they even had 
decent paint! - Sam.
