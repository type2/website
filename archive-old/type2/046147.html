My post was not directed at you, Mike. It was directed at the whole list.
And it was only an opinion which you and others may consider or not as you
choose. Don't take such personally. My viewpoint is different than yours.
As a practicing mechanic with a background in applied sciences, my opinion
would certainly be something different than yours unless maintenance,
repair and restoration of European vehicles is your living, with a
reputation for good results required to earn your keep.

My opinion is still, if you want reliability, longevity and best value over
time, maintain all systems stock. Don't take it personal. Express whatever
opinion you will and give your testamony for all to view. I require no one
to agree with me. Can't you do the same?
