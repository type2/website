&gt; I have lately noticed that after the engine is warm

&gt; Spark ok.
&gt; Compression ok.
&gt; I clearly have a fuel delivery issue, but only to
&gt; cylinder 4. When I pulled the cable for cylinder 4
&gt; when cold, the rpms drop a slight bit, but when the
&gt; engine is hot, there is absolutely no change. Does
&gt; anyone have any advice for my next moves? Perhaps a
&gt; faulty injector? As always, everyones advice is much

OK,
I have checked the valve lash, re-checked the
compression and checked for vacum leaks and everything
is ok. I am also beginning to think that the
difference in performance when the engine is hot or
cold is slight to non-existent (could have been in my
head). Per Karl's suggestion, I switched the wire
connectors between injectors 3 and 4 and 4 continued
to run poorly. Any suggestions on how to check to see
if my injector is either clogged, or just bad? Is it
it big deal to take it out? Also, while I was back
there, I noticed something strange. Out of the same
wiring harness that the connectors for injectors 3 and
4 come out, there is another connector that is
identical, but it isn't connected to anything - it
just hangs there. I cannot find anything that it could
be connected to. Does anyone know what this is?
