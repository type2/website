One subpart to reground cams that has not come up during this thread, but
that has concerned me is the hardening aspect.  Understand that this is
all hearsay, as I have never used a reground cam shaft, but...

As I understand it, the original camshaft is surface hardened and that
they will last many thousands of miles 'til that surface is worn off.  At
that point they wear to uselesness rather rapidly.  Certainly it is
possible to cut the heel to restore the original aspect ratio, but can
they be re-hardened? or are we talking 10K camshafts here?

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
