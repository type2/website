Subject: Re: [VB] Full-length rack for sale

While at octobugfest (Puyallup WA.) A few members of
the wetwesties shared some swap space. Susan, &quot;thanks&quot;
Had what was described as an &quot;after market German
repro&quot; full length rack. It came with what I consider
a set of unusual mounting brackets, they are
adjustable for hight&amp; width, no identifying labels or
stamping&quot;s to be found.

Haven't yet installed it,when I do I will have a 70&quot;X
49&quot; to offer to any one interested, no clamps no
brackets. $300.00, Exl condition. Not a candidate for
shipping.
