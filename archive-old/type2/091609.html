Subject: Penetrol Update.

Well the summer's just about over, and after advising innumerable folks
with faded pop tops to use penetrol to bring back the color of their
oxidized tops---and me being the guinea pig---here are the results---

I applied the first coat in early May---
The second in the first week in June--
And just because I'm nuts--did it again in August---not because the
color was washing out, but for nothing more than preventative
maintenance---and the top looks as good as new--with minimal effort-- 
Wipe it on and walk away---that's it--
It also has made the pop top rubber's look as good as new too---the
double wammy---and I've only used a half a quart can in the process. 

Fall is on it's way, the days are getting way too short for me---and
it's Bye-Bye Westie for the winter pretty quick--back to the GL for the
winter---

Take Care--
