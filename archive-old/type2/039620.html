Subject: tranny diagnosis please

Condition:

Bus running fine, turned onto last straightaway coming home from
work, NO GEARS. Pulled over, turned engine off, managed to
force it into 1st, started up and proceeded towards home. Clutch
cable works, as depressing clutch pedal disengaged engine. But
could not shift gears. Managed to force it into 2nd and got home.

At home, engine off, will shift into all gears reluctantly when
engine
off.

Possible related info

1) TO bearing(?) has been making minor noise  (engine running in
neutral)
when clutch pedal is depressed.

2) Shift lever making noise for a few days. Sounds like computer
hard drive
when reading a big file. Small up or down pressure on lever makes
noise
go away.


Any diagnoses gratefully appreciated.
