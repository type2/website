Subject: Found my muffler &amp; more???'s

First off I got in touch with Cal Imports and they hadn't sent my muffler
and hadn't billed my VISA yet so one problem gone (Hurray!).  So I went
to my arsenal of literature (GASS,VWTrends, Hot VW's and all assorted
catalogs) and way in the corner was a VW JC Whitney catalog.  They
have my exact muffler for $65, I have had it for almost 2 years and no
idea how long the PO had it on there. But 3 years or so  isn't to bad?  For
$75 I could get the Big Bore &quot;MONZA&quot; Exhaust System for VW's. It
appears that it'll bolt right on.  Will this be loud and abnoxious or cool and
quiet?  Muir mentions that the newer set ups will increase power?  If I
recall correctly J.C. Whitney has a somewhat tarnished history?
Furthermore I have had Midas Mufflers on my(former) two Rabbits and
my (present) Golf and haven't had too many problems. Once again I ask
for for your help. I prefer quality items for my bus, I'm not as picky with
my water cooled VW so please don't let me purchase something that will
be a detriment to my beloved bus. Thank you,
