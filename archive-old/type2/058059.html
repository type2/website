Subject: RE: ID'ing campers

&gt;Well, the other day, the wife and I bought a '71 camper, and I &gt;have a few questions...

&gt;First of all, how to tell what type it is?  It's a pop-top, &gt;the top goes straight up, not pitched like a Westy or rolled &gt;like a Dormobile

-- 
Looking at JJRodgers site last night I noticed scans of brochures of
both the Sportmobile and the Riviera, don't know what years, though. 
The only difference I could see from the exterior without my magnifying
glass was that the Riviera has two sets of pop-up supports.  These are
at the front and rear of the pop-up, they're shaped like an X.  The
Sportmobile only had one X shaped support that was centered under the
pop-up.  I'm sure there are lots of other differences noticeable to the
initiated.

The site is:

Hope it helps,
