List,

I have a relative who has a 71 Sportsmobile that has been sitting in his back yard for about 10-15 years that he wants to get rid of.  This bus is fairly complete except for the cabinetry that was inside.  It has the engine, all glass, handles, front chrome luggage rack, and the pop top.  If anyone is interested, the bus is located near Fort Wayne, Indiana and you can email me with any questions.

Take care
