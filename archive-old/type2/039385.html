Subject: getting 75 bus going....symptoms for diagnosis?

Finally got to checking out the 76 FI bus (made Aug 75, one of first FI?
-sat for last 4-5 yrs- bought it with 125lbs compression checked by
me)....Figured out the head sensor wire was off and got that on,
visually checked the big hose connections and gas lines, got a battery
in there, checked for spark and fired it up-died instantly; a closer
check showed the vac line to brakes was not connected.  Tried again,
idled OK, but then gas started coming out below bumper (I wisely had
someone else turn it over as I watched)!  The hose from the cold start
valve to the right fuel rail for the injectors had as aneurysm by a
clamp!  It was well hidden by this plastic covering pipe.  I noticed
it's all braided hose and the later (my 78) has a metal line with
non-braided connectors- is this still available?
   Replaced it with another hose, and got it running, with lots of blue
smoke coming out until it had warmed up- dwell is ok, but it has these
current symptoms- any expert opinions?
1. Open the throttle up quick, and it dies instantly- but open it up
slowly, and it increases fine to max. throttle.
2. A timing light during idle shows that there is a &quot;wander&quot; in timing
from 4 degrees after TDC to about 8 before TDC- It may hold OK for 3
seconds, then wander down, then up!  It does advance properly with
rpms.  Seems strong in the idle, about 900 rpm.
