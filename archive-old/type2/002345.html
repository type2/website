We are still looking for a bus for our daughter.  Or, for me. as I think she will be taking mine in a week or so.  The trip to Reno was the &quot;trip from hell&quot; at least for the first half. the trip back was not too bad.  All I want to say... is.... make sure the #3 temp head sensor is tight, 'nuff said. lol.  but if any one knows of a bus close to our area or within 8-10 hours driving time, let us know.
Thanks,
