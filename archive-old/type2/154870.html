The rebuilders don't use a jig or an old heat exchanger to help the  
drill for the oversize stud but they should. The least they can do is  
put the studs in at the same angle as the old ones which comes under  
the category of competent machining.

Sometimes you can get away with a minor bending of the stud and other  
times you have to seriously bore out of the holes of the collar that  
secure the HE to the heads. The average owner without a drill press  
will hate this job.

The rebuilders ship you an engine that is guaranteed to have exhaust  
manifold problems then have the gaul to state in their warranties  
that they won't cover an overheated engine which is what happens when  
the head overheats at the exhaust port due to a poorly fitting  
exhaust manifold. Sloppy welding at the exhaust port is another  
culprit that gives you warranty headaches.
