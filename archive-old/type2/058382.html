     How do you remove a oil pump that has been plugged for the full flow
system. I have the oil pump puller, but one of the holes is plugged... unless
I am using it wrong and this is not the correct way to use it. (putting it in
the two oil delivery holes)

     Plus the builder cemented it in with Form-a-Gasket and I think trying to
pry it out will only damage the case and the pump.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
