O.K. I'm a regular subscriber to the list but am away from my computer 
this week on spring break.  (wouldn't ya know it just when I need it 
most)

So here's my deal:  I just got a brand new mexican longblock into my 71 
westy.  It is a beautiful engine I hope it runs great once I get it 
started.  So with only a few glitches I got all the stuff from the old 
engine changed over to the new one and got the new one in the car.  All 
I had left to do was to set the timing and then it was going to be time 
to crank her over.  Well I had my static timing light hooked up (was 
just going to time it this way to get her running then I had an 
appointment with my mechanic tomorrow morning so it could get done 
right)  I had my friend turn on the key and I started to rotate the 
engine when I noticed SMOKE comming from the distributor.  After 
removing the dust cover it was obvious that it was comming from 
somewhere near the points.  Do you have any Idea what would have caused 
this??  The points were clean and there was no oil or grease or crap in 
there.  Obviously I'm going to slap a new set of points and condenser in 
there.

Just then, to add to my wowes,  I looked past the distributor and see 
this bare wire hanging there.  The wire is one of the four that are in a 
clump that come from the front.  I looked and looked but for the life of 
me can't figure out where this thing goes back to.  All the wires are 
accountred for.  Two wires attach to the positive side of the coil, and 
then there is the presure sensor wire and then this one.  Do I assume 
that it goes to the neagtive side of the coil?  I have checked the 
wiring diagrams and the only thing it could be is an old wire from the 
test network but I don't remember it being there before.

So any advice anyone can lend would be much appreciated,  and if anyone 
has a question about the mexican longblocks feel free to drop me a line.

Thanks in advance,
Kevin Fox
71 Westy
