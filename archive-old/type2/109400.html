Subject: Charging aux battery with 30 amp relay

Someone posted a week or two back about how to wire in a 30 amp relay with 10
ga wire so you could charge the aux battery while driving.  He said he did it
this way in a 66 westy.  I saved the whole email except the person who wrote
it.  :(

Well anyway I bought the 30 amp relay and the 10 ga wire to attempt this but
have a question.  What terminals do you hook the batteries to?  The original
post said to hook the positive side of main battery to relay, then same to
other battery terminal then third terminal of relay to positive side of
terminal.

My 30 amp relay has 5 terminals  labeled 30, 87, 87, 85 and 86.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
