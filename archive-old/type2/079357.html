Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment?

&lt;&lt; I would suggest just removing the speedometer and sending the whole unit to
a place like Speedometer Plus (http://www.speedometerplus_dot_com) and they will
recondition the whole thing, not only adjusting it for accuracy but fixing
that annoying chatter it makes when it's cold, fixing any odometer problems
and in general making the whole thing look and work like new.  &gt;&gt;

Price?
