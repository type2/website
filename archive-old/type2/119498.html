&lt;&lt; I wonder if it would be good for those half-cans of (expensive) POR-15
products that everyone ends up throwing out after a few weeks?

Got all your marbles...?-)
 Throw 'em in the container until the liquid is back up to the top again.
I can't guarantee it'll be perfect, but it's what I do with half empty/filled
cans of polyurethane and such to extend the shelf life...IIRC, POR-15
moisture cures, so keeping any humidity out of the container is the
secret...(Tho' I did buy some NOS POR-15 once that had never been
opened and got a couple of solid cans for my trouble...)
