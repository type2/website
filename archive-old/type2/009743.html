&gt; &gt;The heat of vaporization provides a hysteresis loop that should allow

&gt; &gt;If the air runs a bit warm, the thermostat opens a bit.  If the air

&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand why this has anything to do with it except that the
&gt; thermostat doesn't open/close at the exact boiling point of the
alcohol--I
&gt; still maintain that it will be either open, closed, or in process of
&gt; opening or closing.
&gt; 
&gt; In order for the thermostat to sustain a state of being half open, the
&gt; alcohol has to sustain a state of half boiling--doesn't it? And that
&gt; doesn't seem very likely.
&gt; 
&gt; I was not able sustain a half-open bellows using a pot of water,
which is a
&gt; much more controlled environment than the ass of a moving bus.

Two things are working against you in the pot of water.  

First, the heat capacity of water is large, meaning that there is a
large reservoir of heat to expand the bellows as soon as there is a
delta-T to move the heat.  Same thing works the other way as well.

Second, in the pot of water there isn't any mechanical friction to
retard the motion of the bellows.
