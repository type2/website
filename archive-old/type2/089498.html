I'm surprised that you can't find a convenience store or gas
station that doesn't have a kerosene pump.=20
Any auto parts store or even a Wal-Mart type store should sell gallon =
jugs


    I use &quot;var-o-sol&quot; (check spelling) in my parts washer. I used to use =
kerosene, but I find it gets so nasty in everyday use. At any rate I buy =
them both from the local Exxon distributor (their the guys that sell the =
gas and oil to the service stations, so any brand will have it), there =
in the yellow pages under Oil Distributors. Another good thing, it costs =
less.
    For a one time use, get few gallons of Diesel fuel, not near the =
fire hazard as gas, and you can get anywhere, but its still nasty.
    One other thing, keep in mind where your going to dispose of what =
every you decide to use, any of it will be &quot;Hazardous waste&quot;. Don't get =
caught dumping it!
