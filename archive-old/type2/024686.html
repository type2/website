Hi all,

Some questions today (some on topic, some off):
First - What (if any) are people's experiences buying stuff from Interstate
VW in SoCal (San Diego area, I think - not sure - all my dealing with them
so far has been over email).  I'm looking at buying a Ghia project from
them.

Second - What is the feasibility of using my '76 2L Westy to tow that Ghia
home (no engine right now), and what equipment would I need to do such a
thing?

Third (I lied - there were more questions) - Anyone in the SD area making a
trip up to the bay area and be interested in towing said vehicle for some
compensation?

Fourth - Are there companies that could ship this vehicle for me?  What are
some suggestions?  What am I looking at for cost?

Thanks,
Niall (Frances - '76 Westy)
