Hey diddlee ho listees,
        I've got a problem going on in my 71 westy that I'm hoping is due to 
the altitude, but I'm looking for some advice.  I just drove my bus out from 
MA to CO, and am now in colorado springs.  I hadn't had any stalling problems 
with my bus ever in the east, and didn't have any out here until i took a 
trip up to boulder.  Ever since then my bus has been stalling fairly 
consistantly every time i try and slow down or stop.  Anytime that I'm not in 
gear is starts to putter and stall if I don't continuously give it gas.  I'm 
hoping that there's a simple solution to this...maybe just an adjustment?  
Please help!  It would be great if any responses could be emailed or cc'd to 
me personally because i've been having email troubles, and haven't been able 
to read the list lately.  Thanks to all
peace
dave 1971 Westfalia &quot;Sugaree&quot;
