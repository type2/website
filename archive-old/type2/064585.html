Subject: re: evaporative cooling

&gt;&gt; Around the same time I got ahold of some information from the
&gt;&gt;National Renewable Resources Lab (URL at my home page) about using
&gt;&gt;evaporative cooling in humid environments. If someone has time, desire, and
&gt;&gt;a little manufacturing know-how, a workable system might be designed. I
&gt;&gt;have all but time... A company already markets these type of systems, but
&gt;&gt;they make them for *real* busses, not our little ol VW's. Someday I may
&gt;&gt;have the time, but if someone else wanted to do the hard work, I wouldn't
&gt;&gt;complain...   ;-)
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, our '71, which was modified for camping by a PO, came outfitted with
&gt;something called a Pla-Cool, which was an evaporative or &quot;swamp&quot; cooler. As

        Yeah, these kinds of systems work well in the desert where it's
dry, but when it's humid they lose most of thier efficency. The NREL answer
is to first de-humidify the air, then run it though a &quot;swamp&quot; cooler.
