Bob,

Don't forget that the 1800 and 2000, in stock configurations, were teamed
with trannies that had different ratios. The most important  difference
being the 'taller' top gear ratio used in the 2L tranny - this works well
with the extra torque delivered by the 2L.

Nonetheless - it sounds like a good price for a spare.

&gt;&gt; I have a 2000cc fuel injected engine that is running pretty well, but I
am

when
&gt;&gt; my good engine goes.  I have a chance to get a 1800 cc engine that still
&gt;&gt; runs for $50.  I have been told that an 1800 cc engine with duel carbs
can
&gt;&gt; be stronger than my current 2000cc.  Is this true and if so how?   Will I
&gt;&gt; loose gas mileage?  Engine life?  Etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Should I hold out for a 2000cc with hydraulic lifters instead?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
