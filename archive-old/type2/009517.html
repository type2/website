Paul:

It sounds like you are talking about the two small air deflectors.  They
attach to the upper cylinder tins at the pulley end just below the large
rear pulley tin.  One fits on each side.

Thank you!

Thus sayeth Paul:

 Help, I'm in the process of putting an engine back together and can't
figure 
 out where the two small pieces of cooling tin go.  This is a 1973, 1600 
 upright engine, with doghouse style oil cooler.  The two small pieces of
tin 
 each have two bolt holes, are irregular shape, 6-8 inches long.  My guess
is 
 they came off the front by the pulley but I don't really know?  Any help 
 would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks, My favorite Murphy's law &quot;You can't fall off the floor&quot;
