Subject: Re: New Pistons ?

You left out a very important factor, that is, that you have more heat to
begin with (before detonation) created by more compression of the mixture.
If all other things were equal and you got identical energy conversion the
higher compression would leave more residual heat.

&gt;However, basic thermodynamics (Thermo I) shows
&gt;that you are converting energy into mechanical
&gt;motion. The more we convert, the less leftover
&gt;heat we have.
