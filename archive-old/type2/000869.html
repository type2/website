Kim,

     If something has broken inside the valve cover &amp; popped through, then I
would not drive it.  More damage could be done.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1600 dualport.  on my way to work this morning I kept hearing
this
&gt; loud popping.  Which I was hoping something was just attached to the tire
&gt; and was hitting the wheel well. Metal against metal.  Welp, I looked when
I
&gt; arrived at work and the whole valve cover on the passenger side is coated
&gt; with fresh clean oil.  So, i'm assuming a rocker arm (is that what its
&gt; called) popped off or a spring broke in there.  I have to still pop it off
&gt; and confirm.  Do you think there is a way to rig it to at least get me
home?
&gt;   its 11 miles.
&gt;
&gt; After I look at it at lunch i'll post what I find.
&gt;
