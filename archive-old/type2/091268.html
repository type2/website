Subject: Re: [T2] The old no title havin' blues

Here is what I did in Virginia to get a title for a 58
BMW Isetta 600 that I had.  I just had to go the the
Virginia DMV website, download a form asking for a new
title to be issued, write my statement on the
circumstances (they had to be valid) and get the form
notarized.  I then wrote a check for the minimum sales
tax in our state, which is $35 and another check for
the titling fee $10, so for $45 I get a new title with
a 30 day wait.  It worked flwlessly for me.  I suppose
they have a wait to make sure the vehicle isn't stolen
and maybe do a stolen VIN check on some computer
database.  No police person had to come out.

YMMV
