&gt; You must have the only VW in Kentucky.
&gt; I can remember very well being chased down those Kentucky hills at 90 MPH
&gt; an hour by Coal Trucks and even then they caught me at the top and closed
&gt; the gap again. Very intimidating when you're on a two lane road with coal
&gt; trucks running that hard in both directions.

I have the other one! Also a 74, BTW.  

Doesn't matter what you're driving, the coal trucks will get you.
