One other thing to check is the drive shaft pulley. If you were stupid
or unlucky enough to have an aftermarket aluminum pulley, it can get
warped and will chatter and vibrate. If it is loose enough, it will
even ruin the end of the crankshaft. This is easy to test. Remove the
fan belt and try to wiggle the pulley. If it wiggles and it is made of
aluminum, replace it with a stock pulley. I learned this from sad
experience. We were on a long road trip, and of course I had no extra
pulley with me.
