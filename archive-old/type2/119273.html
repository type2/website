Subject: Re: [T2] WAS:  More tranny help

Hoping this is still relavent to Snoopy's issues, I am curious about Eron's
comment.  I just put an 091 in my '70 also.  Local VW trans guy swapped out 3
things so that it would be a drop-in fit:
    -front mount (part of nose cone)
    -bellhousing to mate with type 1
    -trans input shaft is shorter by about 1/2 inch (either 3/8 or 5/8, can't
recall).
The reason I wrote in response to the below message:
*** I am using the stock '70 shift linkage. ***

BTW the trans guy has a whole stack of good '72-'75 bus trannies close to
Marietta GA.

Not knowing anything about a '73, its hard for me to understand exactly where
the length issue comes into play for Snoopy--is it truly a combination of the
bellhousing / input shaft deal?  Thinking for all the hassles with the bolts
and the shifter, would it have been easier to swap the bellhousing (input
shaft also)?

PS.  Anyone have an update on last Friday's AIRS situation in SC?

&gt;I have a '79 '091 transaxle in my '70.  As I recall, don't you just need to
&gt;use the shift linkage from a late model('76 - '79) bus?  It worked fine in
&gt;my transplant.
