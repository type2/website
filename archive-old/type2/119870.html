Subject: Solar panel and propane heater?

Hello all, just a quick question, I was wondering if
anyone on the list has bought or used the solar panels
being sold on that auction site we can't mention. The
ad says (This item is designed to keep a 12VDC battery
fully charged over periods of non-use. Originally used
in VW's while in shipping transit, this item is
equipped with a cig lighter plug to easily fit any
vehicle. Works great for batteries in camper trailers.
Maximum Output ratings: 18.8VDC and 170mA at 3.2W) I'm
just wondering if this is worth it or if they work? My
Westy won't get much use this winter and want a way my
batteries will stay good. And if I buy two and hook in
parallel would it help to keep my aux. battery charged
while camping? If you have any better idea's please
let me know?
