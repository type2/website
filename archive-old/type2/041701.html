Hi,

&gt; I'm curious about your opinions about what is the 'best' engine for a '72
bus.

 Depends on what you want it to do.

&gt; I would like to have a reliable motor with a decent amount of power. I.e.
I
&gt; can cruise down the road at 70 mph on a flat-ish highway without worrying
&gt; about blowing the engine up and I don't have to fiddle with the carbs/jets
&gt; every time the weather changes or I change my altitude by a 1000 feet.

 This suggests to me that a near stock 2.0l &quot;pancake&quot; or type 4 engine would
suit you well. By near stock I mean that you might want to add solid state
ignition (hall effect points and CDI). In the USA, fuel injection would
probably be the sensible choice as would hydraulic lifters.

&gt; I keep hearing about Porsche engines, V6's, Japanese motors, hydraulic
&gt; lifters and electronic ignitions, rubberbands used by NASA and hamsters on
&gt; Crack being used.

 Porsche engines offer more power for more money and hassle (both
installation
and ongoing maintenence, since your vehicle is now not stock), V6s offer a 
different balance of money against hassle.
 Hydraulic lifters are generally regarded as a good thing because they save
you the 3000 mile valve adjustments. On the other hand they also lose you 
the possibility of noticing a stretching valve or recessing seat before 
it causes more serious problems.
 Electronic ignition gives you similar periodic maintenance relief and 
better reliability at the cost of harder roadside fixes when things do
go wrong.

Cheers,
	 W.
