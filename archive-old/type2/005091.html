What worked for me was a 3/4 drive,(1/2 is too light), 1 13/16 Craftsman
socket with the Craftsman T handle, driven by a 5' length of antenna mast
from Radio Shack.  Chock all 4 wheels.  Use the bathroom scale method to
torque on install.  For me it was 4 foot from center, 65 lbs off the scale
as you stand on it pulling the bar, 260 ft lb, about.
