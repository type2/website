&gt; Greetings All,
&gt; 
&gt; I just got into removing the axles and servicing my CV joints.  The first one 
&gt; I pulled was shot, so I took a little trip on down to my FLAPS.  I picked up 
&gt; four new CV joints (just in case) and headed back home to do the dirty deed.  
&gt; When I got home and opened up one of the boxes (GKN - Glaenzer Spicer) the CV 
&gt; joint was as stiff as a board.  No movement at all.  If I forced it with hand 
&gt; pressure (about as much as I could exert) only it would eventually give - a 
&gt; little.  Upon opening the other boxes I found they were all like that!

That's how they are when new.  I wouldn't replace all four, though, as the
MTBF of CV joints can vary widely.  Keep a spare joint and boot kit in the
bus and keep on driving!

George Lyle
