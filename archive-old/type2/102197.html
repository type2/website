Subject: Re: [T2] More Power!

&gt;I put the bigger alternator (AL108) in my '79 bus. I didn't modify it for
&gt;more output, so I am guessing that is what was expensive for your
&gt;installation?

I've never had trouble powering my 300W inverter with the stock system. 
Even with the inverter going full tilt I don't think I've ever maxed it out.

A laptop pulls maybe 50W and the battery charger not more than 75W I'd 
guess. I think you'll be just fine with the stock system. Don't expect to 
power alot of big loads with the engine at idle though.
