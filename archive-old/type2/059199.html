What i am doing to solve this very expensive problem.  Is i am getting
all the
BIG cardboard boxes i can find.  BiG Refrigerator and TV boxes or try
your
friendly Local VW shop they get big boxes!  and i am going to cut them
up then put thompsons water seal on the backside and then spray paint
them grey.  I have all the chrome peices for a deluxe so i might stick
those in there to make it look better. to attack i am either going to
use duck tape on the backside or maybe some screws with big washers.
Cheap and you can make them easy.  replace them every 3-6 months. unless
you have really crappy seals.

  You might find that using 1/4 inch plywood a more viable solution.
Treated and covered or painted it will last a lot longer, the cost is
not that great and will probably look a fair amount better then
cardboard. It also lends it self to a number of coverings form vinyl
adhesive,  carpet, paint , tile, just about any thing you can think of
and will stand up to wear and tear much better. Properly fitted and
secured, it should probably last almost the life of the bus, granted a
slightly more involved install, although in the long run probably
cheaper and easier to maintain. And would probably give more over all
satisfaction, and considering that a 4x8 foot sheep of finished  1/4
plywood generally runs about $10-15  the total over all cost should be
well under $75 to do all of the interior, and being as thin as it is it
will add it self to a small amount of curving with out any special
effort, and can be forced in to more dramatic curves with the use of a
couple of block and a weight. Might be some thing to think about before
you go and duct tape up cardboard.. but that's just my $0.02 worth..
