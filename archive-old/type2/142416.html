Subject: Oxy-acetylene welding video?

Can anyone recommend a video that teaches technique for oxy-acetylene 
welding? It's been more than twenty years since I spent any time with a 
torch, and I made only just passable welds even then.

(I know that a course would be better, but I haven't the social skills 
to do that.)

Mark
