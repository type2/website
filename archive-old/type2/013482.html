I've got a pair of heat exchangers off an 83 Air cooled and also have the
crossover pipe in good shape with a good catalytic converter on it. You'd
need to purchase a new muffler and the short tail pipe.
P-mail  me for details.
It would ship from Dallas TX 75220 and both heat exchangers and the
crossover would weigh in at about 70 Pounds and pack in two cartons.
Go here to get your UPS charges

*switch to either a '72-74 or '79-83 system (best solution, solves the
problem for good, but requires replacement of the heat exchangers).*
