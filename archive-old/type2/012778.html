&gt;
&gt;I just saw a perfect Riviera pop top in the junk yard in the Portland Oregon
&gt;area, the tent was even in good condition.

..and you left it there? ;-)  Makes me think you mean &quot;poptop canvas&quot;, not &quot;tent&quot;

  TENT: not permanently attached, often freestanding, has bags, poles, stakes.

  POPTOP CANVAS: the flexible part of an elevating roof

More and more lately I'm seeing references to &quot;tents&quot; when it's obvious that the writer is talking about the canvas/screen portion of the poptop.  This threatens to 
frustrate me, Mr. Language Nazi, even more than the VW-only usage of &quot;ragtop&quot; to mean a cloth-sunroof car (*everyone* else uses &quot;ragtop&quot; to mean &quot;convertible&quot; -- 
look it up).

Tent &lt;&gt; Poptop Canvas.

And if the Hysens *did* leave a Riviera tent in that junkyard, anyone wanna go get it for me?
