Subject: Re: [T2] more carb discussion (quasi-longwinded)

	Jennifer, Bob, Oh Great &amp; Wondrous List, et al...  Dellorto blowhard
mode on.

	Three words here:  1) Dell  2) 'orto 3) 36 DRLAs  (Ok, I lied it's
4)...

	Bob - with all due respect, OG Solexes are getting to be a real PITA
to get to work anymore, just ask listee Ben Huotx...  Ben's recently given
up in disgust, and installed a proggy Weber on his '73.  Not sure that it's
a step in the right direction, but what ever trips yer trigger...

	If you find yourself needing to run carby-ray-tors on a Type 4 motor
in a bus, a set of 36 DRLAs is probably a good choice here.  Any other
listees similarly situated (and YOU know who you are, Paul Gould and Chris
Mills), feel free to chime in here.  They have a vac port so's you can hook
up your OE dizzy, there's an Italian chap who regularly sells sets of 'em on
&quot;that&quot; auction site we can't discuss here, and the complete
aircleaner/manifold kits for the Type 4 are available from CB Performance
(approx. $200 last time I looked)...  CBs also got rebuilt kits, jets, and
all the swag you will need to get them up and running.  Buy the Dell book as
part of your first order...  The grammar / spelling is horrid, and you may
find yourself speaking in run-on sentences for a day or two after you read
it, but it's a worthwhile purchase.

	The Italian chap's prices for a pair of 'em on the &quot;buy-it-now&quot;
option are VERY reasonable if'n you don't have VeeWee swap meets near you,
and the 36s only require a couple of jet changes to make them US-spec
equivalent.  The 36s will work on motors 1.7L to 2.0L in size (don't AMHIK):
US-spec jetting out of the box works pretty good on a 1.7L, but a 2.0L will
require some changes (p-mail if interested in what works for my 2055 T4).
I've paid as little as $200 for OK US-spec 36s on Type 1 manifolds, up to as
much as $300 for a VERY cherry set on T1 manifolds (ridiculously inflated
Los Angeles-area swap meet prices).  YMMV...

	Howza gas mileage, you say?  No worse in town than the OG 1 barrel
Solexes (and generally better), 18-22 highway on the 40s (w/ update kit) in
the 2055 in my '72 Weekender.  But you gotta cheat here - combo dizzy and a
CDI unit are the key.  Points and 009/050s need not apply...  914 1.7L gets
26-27 mpg in town, 35 highway on 36s, '73 Dee-luxe with a 2055 and 36s gets
even better milage than the Weekender, and the Dee-luxe has even got the OE
stump-puller tranny...  Who'da thought life could be so good?  BTW if you
think this is a lot of money to spend - try to find out how much a properly
rebuilt set of 34 Solexes will set you back.  When you are done crying,
investigate how much a good aftermarket EFI rig will s*ck out of your
pocketbook.  $400-$450 for a set of 36 DRLAs and the manifold kit is a
bargain!

	That is all...  Dellorto blowhard mode off.
