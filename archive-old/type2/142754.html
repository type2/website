Subject: Carb Follies (Long! But aren't all my posts long?)

73 Westy, stock PDSIT carbs.

Sorry I haven't been posting. Lappy is in the shop and so I have to
use my wife's computer. Ugh.

Anyway, for the past few days I've had bizarre problems after the bus
ran wonderfully once I fixed the fuel pump issue. The idle would
sometimes be perfect and sometimes stall. Power at high RPMs was ok,
but it would buck and stutter or even stall at lower RPMs especially
under load like taking off from a light or climbing a hill.

I first verified all my spark and fuel. Even replaced the
cap/rotor/condensor/points and the coil and plugs just to make sure
(it was time for most of that anyway). Fuel was pumping beautifully
through my clear fuel filter, and when I loosened the clamp where the
fuel lines go to the carbs it gushed (engine running. ACK! heh)

Drove it around the apartments trying to nail what the problem was. At
one point I had gotten out and popped the engine hatch to see fuel
POURING out of my left carb. It looked like it was coming from the
throttle shaft, but I can't be absolutely certain. I had suspected
this before, but couldn't find any sign of fuel. I guess it was just
evaporating before I could see it.

Anyway, I pulled 3 left carbs out of my box'o'carbs and started
looking at the bushings. 2 were obviously out of round, but one was as
perfect as my amateurish eye can see. That one got the rebuild.

The kit I used was a Walker kit that was given to me with the
box'o'carbs. It's a &quot;universal&quot; kit, for all PDSIT carbs, including
the Type 3 carbs. So it was missing important things like adjuster
screws, but had gobs of extra gaskets and such. It also had 2
different needle valves, one slightly deeper than the other. I picked
the one that matched my original, but it was nice to see I could have
a shorter one if I needed it.

I worked in sections: Choke assy, then horn, then body, then throttle.
This way I didn't lose anything important (now WHERE did that _at_#%^^
throttle plate screw go?)

NOTE: Neither latex nor nitrile gloves are proof against Parts Dip!!!!
NOTE: Spray carb cleaner in the eye is NOT fun!!! I still can't focus
my right eye completely!

Because this carb was at least as bad as the one I sent Richard and he
declared &quot;junk&quot;, I made sure I had lots of carb cleaner spray. This
cleaned out the passages (only one was actually blocked! WooHoo!)
soaking them in carb cleaner after the parts dip, and using the
cleaner to remove the parts dip left in nooks and crannies, was
wonderful. I only had one can of air so it got used sparingly: only in
passages after cleaning with carb cleaner.

Because this was an emergency rebuild, I didn't have an opportunity to
test the accel pump. I just verified it worked. My float hit the
correct height right off the bat.

Anyway, I swapped all the solenoids and such from the old carb to the
new one. In the process I noticed (well, I noticed it before, but
subconsciously disregarded it) the port that the idle circuit solenoid
goes into had been retapped with a larger size. To make it worse, the
retapping job was so bad it exposed the bottom of the opening. It was
also missing one of the casting plugs on the idle circuit. I JBWelded
them shut. Bleh. I was hoping to do it right.

Installed with the spacer that was a real PAIN to scrape off the old
gaskets, all new gaskets, yadda yadda yadda. Set every screw to 2 1/2
turns out and fired it up.

Varroooom! First try! And I didn't even prime the bowl!!!

Can't find my _at_!#%%_at_^&amp; Unisuck to balance the carbs, so tried it by
ear. They don't feel right to me, but I think I'm not going to sweat
it for now. I want to rebuild the right carb (did I mention that
box'o'carbs came with 2 kits?) and start relatively fresh.

Sooo... What do I risk by running slightly out of balance? Like I
said, I did it by ear (rpm drop when pulling the solenoid) and I think
it's close. But the idle's a bit rough, and there's a bit less power
than I expected.
