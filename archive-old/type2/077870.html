Subject: Re: [T2] Cops &amp; Buses

I have been driving my bus for 2 years to shows, camping, festivals, etc in
NC, SC, and GA. I have never been pulled over. I see cops all the time and
they just drive on by. In fact last summer I took to driving around with my
sliding door open all the time. I passed cops and worried about them pulling
me over for it, but they never did. I do have long hair and probably look
the part to some, and I have stickers and a funky paint job. (Hippyish I
suppose)

I always keep my lights working, radar detector on and my tag and inspection
up to date though. Maybe I just look like a nice guy. HEHE
