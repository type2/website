Subject: Re: [T2] leakdown test?

it depends what you want to accomplish.  If you know you've got a leak
and want to know from where, all you need is an air compressor hooked up
to a spark plug adapter (sears compression test hose works nicely).  For
this test, you want to turn the engine so the piston in the cylinder
you're testing is at TDC.  Then put the car in gear and hand brake on
(so engine can't spin).  Then add air.. 100 psi is fine.  If you hear
noise in the exhaust, you have a leaky exhaust valve, if you hear noise
from the intake, you have a leaky intake valve, if you hear noise from
the breather, you have leaking rings.  I know on water cooled cars, if
you see bubbles in the coolant, you have a head-gasket leak.. but if you
had a leaky head on an aircooled vw.. hmm.. I dunno what it'd do..
...repeat this for every cylinder.

Anyways, that's the basic idea.  To see how much you're losing, you need
to get the leakdown gauges.  I believe the way it works is like this...
there's the compressor, then a hose to one gauge, then a valve, then
another gauge, then a hose to the plug.  The actual leakdown tester is
just the two gauges and one-way valve.  When you hook up the hose to the
plug, the second gauge will drop (based on how much air is lost in the
cylinder).  Assuming you run 100psi, I think 80psi (80%) is tolerable. 
Below that, you've got some leaks.

If you want more info, go to google_dot_com and type leakdown test and
you'll probably find a slew of info.

&gt; these go for?
