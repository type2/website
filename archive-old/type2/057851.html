Subject: Painting body work

Hello, and it is great to be getting information again. Thanks to the folks
that have put energy into maintaining and improving the list. The question is
this, I am going to repaint the 78 bus type 2 engine, it has lots of little
rust with very minor major nothing rotten or like that. Should I go all the
way to bare metal on the whole bus, paint and then put on three coats of
clearcoat? Also underneath I would like to coat where the original stuff is
coming off any ideas?

Thanks for the help/
