Subject: high idle when warm

Hey folks, my recently rebuilt 79 Westy w/2.0L FI
engine experiences a higher than normal idle when
fully warm after being on a road trip.  It also seems
to idle a little too low when cold.  It's got a new
cold start valve and thermo-time sensor and double
relay.  The auxiliary air regulator is closing
completley when warm.  I've looked in the FI manuals,
the Bentley and the archives and can't seem to find
any answers relative to this particular issue.  Any
light(s) you might shed on the problem would be
helpful and appreciated.  Thanks, Greg
