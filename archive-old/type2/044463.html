Subject: Re: rear deck lid   AND   a story

It would seem that the consensus for this thread (if I may jump in) is to 
leave well enough alone (the old DM).

Now for the story:

Driving home from DocRic's several years ago, my bus quit.  I nearly had the 
engine pulled on the side of the interstate (in the shadow of a bridge -- it 
was hot as hell) trying to track down the problem.  My wife and niece and 
nephew took it a lot better than I did.  No one stopped either.  Anyhoo, 
having not found the problem and praying that I put everything back together 
the way it was, I jumped in and lo and behold it started right up!  DAMN!  So 
with tears of joy streaming down our cheeks we headed on our way home (still 
more than an hour away).  Well . . . a few miles later it quit again.  DAMN!  
I walked to a nearby phone and called Merle, my trusty VW mechanic at the 
time (he has since retired).  He said, &quot;Try this.  Pour some cold water over 
the fuel pump when it happens again.  Prop the lid open to keep the fuel pump 
cooler.&quot;  So I did.  And it worked.  Every twenty miles or so, Lurch would 
quit, I would jump out and pour water over the fuel pump, and Lurch was good 
for another little while.  I did everything I could do to keep temps down -- 
coasting down hills, driving slower, keeping RPMs down.  My CHT gauge 
indicated that all these things were working.  The diaphragm in the fuel pump 
had failed.

Having said that, most of the discussion concerning this thread has been 
about getting the coolest possible air to pass over the cylinders (by way of 
the cooling fan).  In my desperation to keep Lurch running, I went along with 
Merle's advice, thinking,  &quot;Well, yes, that fan is doing nothing to keep the 
engine compartment cool, so everything upstream from it has the potential for 
getting pretty hot.  So this open hatch is keeping the back of the engine in 
a constant slipstream of air.&quot;  Anyhow, we got home safely and I put a new 
fuel pump on.  Realizing now that really hot air can be sucked in through the 
back, I may not try this stunt again, but it worked for me, and although he 
is retired, I believe he was one of the best around for air cooled problems.  
He is missed.
