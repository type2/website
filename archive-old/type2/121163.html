Subject: Re: [T2] List Policies and Sliding door question

&gt; BUS CONTENT:  What is the part that kicks the back of the sliding door out
&gt; when the handle is pushed down?  My sliding door doesn't pop out and I have
&gt; to grab it and pull it out.  After looking at it I can't see what it is that
&gt; kicks the door out on its own.

I believe it's that &quot;u&quot; bar at the back of the door that connects the 
door to the track.  I think it is spring-loaded and pushes the door back 
out.  Try lubing that and it should fix the problem.
