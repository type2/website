Subject: [T2] 82 Westy issues

Hi all,

     This maybe long but I have to get some help here.  I bought my first
Vanagon Westy in October I think.  It is a stock 82 FI 2.0l westy camper.
It is very underpowered in my opinion.  All I have ever had was 71-79 buses.
My last three were 79 station wagon, 76 Westy &amp; a 79 camper conversion.  I
know how these things are supposed to run.  My Vanagon is a different story.
I am floored most of the time just to do 60-65.  I am getting only about
14MPG.  Freeway on ramps make me downshift to 3rd.  I also have a unsteady
idle of about 200RPM while at idle.  sometimes when I downshift for a corner
to 2nd &amp; give it gas, there is a hesitation.  The car just goes flat for a
second or two.

     Here is what I have done.  Full tuneup including plugs, points,
condenser, wires, cap &amp; rotor.  My compression readings are 110PSI in all 4
cylinders.  I checked it twice to make sure.  I have tested both the vacuum
&amp; centrifugal advance &amp; they both are working.  My fuel pump pressure check
out per Bentley.  The whole FI system checks out including the temp sensors.
All my wheels are rolling free &amp; true.

     Any ideas would be appreciated.  I am going nuts here.  I am about to
give up &amp; just go buy another bay window westy.  Thanks.
