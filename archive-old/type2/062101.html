The Inuvik Run -- More Dawson

29 July

2030 -- The bus is ready to roll.  I am not.  Pulled something in
my shoulder when adjusting the toe-in, coaxing the bus to roll back
and forth on the not too level ground.

Checked out Sue's radio.  The mike is okay.  Measured some output
from the modulator section but nothing from the final's pre-amp. 
It uses a circuit I'm familiar with, luckily.  But I don't have
the parts or tools to effect a proper repair.

Helped Eddie with his broken wind-wing, making a cardboard pattern
that will allow him to cut pieces of plastic drink bottles to the
correct contour.

In the course of her trans-Canada wanderings Sue has amassed a
large (heavy!) collection of rock specimens including a stunning
example of Labradorite  She is a trained geologist but seems
unfamiliar with placer mining.  I'm an untrained geologist but I
can recite whole chapters from 'Metallica,' the Roman-era treatise
on winning metals from the earth.  It's surprising how little
mining has changed in 2,000 years.

Dawson sits at the confluence of the Yukon and Klondike, approached
through a moonscape of debris fields left by the dredgers.  The
world once thought the streets of Dawson were paved with gold.  It
was a considerable surprise for me to see they are not paved at
all.
  
The turn of the century goldrush, the memory of which is still
mined by Dawson, lasted only a year or two, just long enough for
Big Money to assess the commercial potential and buy up the more
valuable claims.  Once that was done they brought in dredges to
rape the land, leaving the low-grade deposits for the fevered few
who to this day eke a living from Klondike gold.  It
saddens me to see how little Dawson has derived from the
billions carried away.

Placer mining in frozen terrain is a special case.  People knew
there was gold in this region fifty years before the '98 Stampede
but the cost of recovery was more than the gold was worth.  It must
have taken some powerful economic forces to convince people to work
a placer at a cost of about fifteen dollars per ounce when the
price of gold was only a dollar more.  Little wonder the goldrush
lasted only a year or two. 

None of the people I spoke with could provide any information about
the placer deposits or the dredges, other than what was available
in the local give-away flyers.  Maps obtained in Whitehorse gave me
some idea of what areas are available for mining and a trip to a
hill overlooking Dawson gave me a feel for the terrain.  Given the
present price of gold and using modern pocket-dredger methods,
there is still money to made in this area working placer claims.

Some of the gold nuggets I saw for sale in the shops appear to be
fabricated.  There's nothing illegal in converting one form of raw
gold into another, unless it's assay changes along the way.  When
asked the fineness of certain nuggets the clerks said they didn't
know what I meant or that I would have to talk to the owner.  No
owner was ever available.

It was a nice day.  Jorge's burns look horrible but he is mending
well.

Tomorrow the Dempster.

(After-trip comments:)

I've worked on and surveyed a number of placer claims in the United
States and Mexico.  I was very interested in the Klondike and
Cassiar regions for that reason.

The image of the 49-er with his pick, shovel and gold-pan is no
more valid than that of a cowboy with a pistol on his hip.  That
there were such people there is no doubt but their numbers are
minuscule compared to the legends they've spawned.  The typical
drover did not even own a handgun and the gold-pan is used
primarily for prospecting.  Once placer gold is found and the
extent of the deposit determined, other methods of extraction and
concentration are used.

Instead of repairing his wind-wing with clear plastic Eddie simply
covered the hole with the cardboard pattern I'd cut.  It got him
home although it was a little hard to see through.

I was a bench tech at Westcomm for about three years, repairing CB
radios, among other things.  Rumors that checking out Sue's radio
only made it worse are untrue :-)
