Subject: timing question

&gt;If in doubt, set the maximum advance at about 30 &gt;Degrees and let the idle advance
fall wherever it winds up.
&gt;I hope this helps, anyone with specific questions can e-&gt;mail me and ask.
&gt;I'll try to help.

What is Maximum advance vs. idle advance??

thanks,

dale g
