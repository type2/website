Subject: Here's a rare one

Hello,

While setting the valves, timing and some minor ignition things
I blew a tachometer (SUNPRO) and had to purchase a new one.

The directions say that when using a High Performance coil,
like the Bosch Blue coil, that I may have selected the incorrect
tach connection or a filter assembly is required. I think not?

Does any one know what this filter assembly is, and/or another
location for the tach lead location other than -1.

It ran fine for a 6 months actually. I am not sure if it’s the coil
or I may have accidentally grounded the tach lead wire.

PS.  To everyone that replied, thanks for all the help.
I am real close to an almost perfect running bus. Planning a trip
this weekend in the Black River Falls area of Wisconsin.
