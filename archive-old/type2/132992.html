Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15 yes or no - Heat Curing?

Phil,

Go back and read their FAQ...I think they say that heat will *not* cause 
it to dry faster, only a high humidity environment.

Phil,  they do say that the fumes are DANGEROUS!  This is one of the
few things that I *always* put on my organic vapor mask for.

The powder coat folks say that you should *never* cook your powder coat in 
the same oven that you cook food in...I suspect that por15 vapors in a 
food oven would be worse...

please think it over...

Cheers, dave

&gt; I often cure small painted parts in the oven at 200 degrees for about 30
&gt; minutes. This hardens/ages the paint considerably and I don't have to wait
&gt; for overnight drying.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently, I POR 15'ed some small parts and after baking them for 30 minutes
&gt; I found that the POR 15 was wetter (flowed more) than when freshly applied.
&gt; So am I correct in assuming that POR 15 does not cure with heat or at least
&gt; as in the oven at 200 degrees as does normal spray can paint? Anyone else
&gt; have this experience?
