Subject: Re: vacuum retard question

&gt;When does it kick in?  Is it only active on
&gt;idle/decel or all the time?

It runs strictly on manifold vacuum. Anytime the
manifold vacuum is high the retard kicks in. So it
works at idle and on deceleration, and a little at
partial throttle with no load.
