Subject: FI fuel mixture adjustment
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990623055625.0098e360_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

Hello All,
I've had to swap AFM's on my bus (currently seeking a working used
one if anyone has one:) In reading the list/archives/manuals I've
realized you need a &quot;exhaust gas analyzer&quot; to properly adjust the
mixture. Although it is possible to do it yourself with an oxygen
sensor/voltmeter combo. So I'm *considering* taking my bus to a
paid-mechanic to have the fuel mixture checked. This is my second
bus and the only time I have allowed a paid-mechanic touch a bus of 
mine was to install new tires and they were about to jack the rear
end up with the jack under the engine, before I came running/screaming..
so needless to say, i am not excited about taking it to someone.
But as I am about to depart on an extended trip, I would like to know
that the mixture is set properly. If for no other reason than peace 
of mind.

So.... I was hoping those of you knowledgeable in such matters would
help to educate me.

*I am EGR-less, blocked off at throttle.
Is the Bentley spec. still the correct reading?

*How much should i expect to pay someone to &quot;check/adjust&quot; mixture?

*When calling is there anything in particular that I should ask about?
or just ask if he can &quot;check my FI fuel mixture and adjust if necessary?&quot;
There is a local shop that has been in business for 25+ yrs and use to
work on VW's. Now he specializes in porsche only. I am hoping he will
be willing to do this. he was willing to replace a stud in a head, that
I had torqued to 33ft lbs when it was suppose to be 13ft lbs... but thats
another story....

thanks for all the help!

               ****** bonus question: :-) ********
can someone define &quot;pinging&quot; for me? I read this in the archives/list
all the time.... and could possibly be hearing it.... if i knew what it
was...checked the muir sounds page, with no luck.
