Subject: Thermostat

I just pulled the thermostat out of my 83 last weekend and my thermostat
was firmly bolted to the thermostat bracket. No &quot;floater&quot; here. is this
possibly a different set up, or is the &quot;squirrel's accordion&quot; (thermostat)
supposed to be bolted to the bracket

Tom:

On one end of the thermostat is a brass &quot;nut&quot; that screws into the 
thermostat.  One side of this &quot;nut&quot; is closed off, except for a small hole 
in the middle.  Unscrew this &quot;nut&quot; and pass the thermostat cable through 
this hole from the threaded side of the &quot;nut&quot; such that the small 
molded-in barrel on one end of the cable is captured inside the nut.  
Then screw the nut back on the thermostat. 

The thermosat basically &quot;floats&quot; inside the bracket, that is the 
thermostat and bracket are not attached one to the other.  The bracket 
attaches to the engine with the 2 small studs that are there for that 
purpose, trapping the thermostat inside.

&gt; Have thermostat, just recieved cable &amp; bracket from Ron _at_TBD (Thanks)
&gt; 
&gt; I seem to be missing something to affix the cable to the thermostat, and
&gt; something to affix the thermostat to the bracket.  Anyone know what?
&gt; Have a picture?  Know  where to purchase them?
