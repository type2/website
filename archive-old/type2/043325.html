Subject: Re: breaker ponts screw

&gt; I have a 1979 Westy Automatic.
&gt; Try this as a solution:
&gt;
&gt; At idle, I have to set my timing to 20 to 25 degrees(to the left of the
ZERO
&gt; mark) = 20 BTDC.

HUH???  You have something WRONG inside your distributor. Like maybe the
breaker plate is sticking?

&gt; After locking the parking break, I put the bus in Drive.  The idle now
drops
&gt; and I re-adjust timing to 7.5 BTDC or more to
&gt; Attain a proper 900 RPM. (Can any one confirm this?)
&gt;
&gt; Do you have a manual transmission? If so then, I would just set the timing
&gt; 20 to 25 BTDC and see if it runs better.

With a single vacuum advance distributor on a 2.0L, never go more than 8
BTDC.

&gt; My car still runs a little weird and I am still trying to find the best
&gt; (HOT) valve adjustment.

HUH???  You should have hydraulic lifters. Adjust them 1 turn past lash and
LEAVE them alone!

&gt; I read today that the timing at idle should be set like this:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Two suggestions Will. First, check to see if it is advancing too far.
&gt; Connect your
&gt; timing light and tach/dwell, and see what the advance is at 3300 RPMs when
&gt; the
&gt; engine is warm. It should be 28-30 degrees advance max.&quot; - David and Anna

NO NO NO!
NOT on your 77 to 79 with a single vacuum advance. Total advance at 3600 if
everything is working correctly is 39-43 degrees. The Wolfs info is closer
to an earlier [72-74] 1700/1800 with a dual vacuum advance.

SET YOUR TIMING TO THE DISTRIBUTOR # YOU HAVE IN YOUR BUS!!!
