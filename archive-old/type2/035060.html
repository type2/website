Subject: BBB IV Magazine coverage

Just got the call today, put on your Sunday best, VW classics is covering
the event, it's about time that a VW related mag covered a true bus event,
not the trailer queen hooplas with all the same things year after year, so
wash up that rustybus, pile your roofs racks high, get your camp set up to
the max and let's show the world what a true peoples VW bus show is all
about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They will be there all three days of the event as well as local TV and
newspaper, BBB IV will be a blast and all will have fun at the first BUS
show of Y2K, see you all soon.
