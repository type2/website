Subject: June Bug Jam in Ridgecrest

Saturday, June 17 7am to 2pm Ridgecrest is having its own &quot;Bug Jam&quot; all VWs 
welcome. It will be located at Nicoletti's Espresso Cafe at 809 N. China Lake 
Boulevard in Ridgecrest. They are charging $15. I just found out about it 
myself. Their advertisement says there will be a raffle for a &quot;1600 engine&quot;. 
This is an inaugural event so I will be there, hopefully in my '80 Vanagon 
WITH auxiliary battery. I know it is short notice and it will be HOT, but it 
might be fun. I have no financial interest in letting the world know about 
this event as I am not selling anything there. Its main sponsor is a VWFLAPS 
in town. Everyone have a nice and safe weekend.
Dana
