Bus Folks,

Since we're talking about the 009, here is my (limited) experience. My 74
Bus came with a 009. I was told that the 009 works fine for an upright
engine, it doesn't have enough total advance for a pancake. I went to a
(new) Bosch 050 (for half the price of a used stock dist) and am very
pleased with the results.

Stil raining, still dreaming,
