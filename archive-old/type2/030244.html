&gt; I think this is an important point.  I work in a shop myself, and have 
&gt; to buy most of the tools that I use.  Just installing my engine and 
&gt; tranny I would say I used about $1500 worth of tools.  These were just 
&gt; simple hand tools mind you...

Yow!  They must be made of tempered gold!  I doubt that my modest tool
chest that I use for everything I do cost more than $500.  Well, there is
that 15mm box wrench that I needed to loosen the Mexican-sized valve lock
nuts.  I sent my wife to Sears to buy it, so if you count the cost of the
wife, the wedding, and the two children I guess I have a pretty tidy sum
tied up in my tools...  :)

&gt; The amount of money spent on tools by mechanics is just insane.  Keep in 
&gt; mind most of us &quot;buy off the truck.&quot;  These are tools such as Matco 
&gt; (what I usually buy), Snap-on, Mac, etc...  A nice basic wrench set can 
&gt; easily run you $300.

I know that buying off the truck is convenient, but geeze, does the Matco
guy sell crack too?

OTOH, what you are paying for when you hire a mechanic is the knowledge
between his ears.  If you find a good one, this knowledge is invaluable,
as the job will be done right the first time.  

Unfortunately, mechanics of this caliber are few and far between.  As the
old VW ad said, &quot;Are you paying someone to learn how to work on your VW?
