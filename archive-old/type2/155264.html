Subject: Re: [T2] Blocking air intakes???

I'm not sure they will make much of a difference with the amount of heat you
get in the cabin.  The heat exchangers are going to get to the same
temperature, and the covers don't block off the intakes entirely.  I can see
them helping with moisture in the cabin.  Whenever it's snowing and blowing
(like it is here now), the snow tends to get blown into the engine
compartment through the vents and then sucked into the heater.  This gets
melted and boiled by the heat exchangers, instantly frosting up the entire
interior of the bus.  It's not bad if the snow is blowing in while you're
going down the road.  It's worse if the snow has blown into the engine
compartment while you were parked.  It gets dislodged and sucked into the
heater at some random time while you're driving.  One second you've got
clear windows, the next second you can't see out of any of the windows.
Even the gauges get frosted up.

Obviously, I don't actually have intake covers.  Does anyone on the list
have them?  I might be interested in making some and trying them out.

  Do you guys think this will help with cabin heat, or kill the airflow?  I
&gt; can't see overheating, but just curious about air flow.
