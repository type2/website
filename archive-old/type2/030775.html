&gt; Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Melissa, but the symptoms that you
&gt; have described are consistant with a failure of the large plastic gear
&gt; inside the motor/gearbox.  

This happened to me as I was leaving town for a road trip in a rain storm.
The wipers just stoped in the middle of the windshield. It took me several
hours and about $100 to find one in town, take out the old one and replace
it. The only bad part was the infamous plastic gear in the motor assembly.
Mine had no more teeth. I kept the old motor, and am looking into getting
a metal gear manufactured in order to eliminate the problem forever.

&gt; Some have claimed success with disassembly
&gt; and epoxying the gear back to the shaft.  (Didn't work for me.) 

I imagine this works for some because the pin that turns the plastic gear
has chewed away the inside rather than the teeth of the gear as was the
case with my motor.

&gt; The
&gt; easiest repair is replacement.  Try to get the entire wiper mechanism
&gt; assembly as it's a real PITA to get the arm indexed properly so that the
&gt; wipers park at the bottom of their stroke.

That was the hardest part of the job, but I got it working right through
trial and error in about 45 minutes. Don't be intimidated by the job! You
can replace it and get the wipers to park in the right place. When you
take the old motor out pay close attention to the angle the wiper bar
makes with the motor assembly and try to duplicate that angle when you
reinstall. If they don't park in the right place I found that I could
loosen the nut enough without taking it off in order to be able to move
the bar slightly in one direction or another. It is a pain to get in there
to do this, but I found it to be easiest. Remove the glove box to give you
some more room to work with the thing.
