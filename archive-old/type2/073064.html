Subject: the bus that came from a wish of a monkey paw...

Hello... webmaster
    i picked up  a 1977/78 camper bus. it is an automatic. it was
sitting behind a friends house for about a year and they had to get rid
of it . they were too lazy to sell it. the price was right, free.  so as
it stands the engine is not in it but off to the side in the basement.
now a few people who new the old owner have been telling me that the
transmission needs work. and other people tell me that the best thing to
do is to put in a manual and an older engine because of problems with
the engines in the latter molds. my questions are as follows;  should i
consider working on the transmission ( i have little knowledge) or put
in a manual. are there problems with the older engines and the fuel
injection or should i put in a older  engine without fuel injection? so
all in all i have loads of options as is i could put it all back
together and see what is what, or i could sell the engine and
transmission and get a manual, and  what would that cost ? okay, sorry
if i am vague
i'll elaborate if you need me to.

thanx

Mathew
