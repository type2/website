&gt; One subpart to reground cams that has not come up during this thread, but
&gt; that has concerned me is the hardening aspect.  Understand that this is
&gt; all hearsay, as I have never used a reground cam shaft, but...
&gt; 
&gt; As I understand it, the original camshaft is surface hardened and that
&gt; they will last many thousands of miles 'til that surface is worn off.  At
&gt; that point they wear to uselesness rather rapidly.  Certainly it is
&gt; possible to cut the heel to restore the original aspect ratio, but can
&gt; they be re-hardened? or are we talking 10K camshafts here?
Steve:
Rest assured that most all large performance cam grinders started out
life as RE- grinders -Crane, Crower, Isky, etc. There is a large
assembled base of knowledge out there that is a bit more than our few
lines. I was involved in dragracing in the 70's and at that time there
were pushrod Chevies whose valves were not floating at speeds over
10,000 rpm. The science involves many aspects including heat treating,
material compatability, cam lobe profiles etc.
Many companies are quite trustworthy in this field, but any retailer
would not continue to sell products that caused many warranty returns,
so my advice would be that if you trust your retailer, you should trust
his judgment in selecting products.
I should mention that any time you replace the cam, you should replace
the lifters, preferably with those from the same grinder. Most cam
grinders' warranties state this.
Type 1 cams are so cheap I would always replace them. I always use used
cams in type 4 motors and have never seen one totally failed, although
I've seen many I wouldn't us over!
