&gt; im trying to get my 78 westy back 100% stock. I have the dreaded 009 and

&gt; price for one, i am sure used is all that available? Sources?  

Actually, as lately as a month ago, rebuilt was still available.  I bought
a rebuilt dist for a '73 from Olympic Foreign Car Parts
(http://www.forparts_dot_com/), but I am sure that Ron Salmon
(www.busdepot_dot_com), John Connolly (www.aircooled_dot_net), or Bus Boys
(www.bus-boys_dot_com) could get you one.  The price, depending on source will
be in the $70-100 range.
