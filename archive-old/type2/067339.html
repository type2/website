&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt;
&gt; As I was driving around earlier (116* today) I was wondering if any later
&gt; model &quot;loafs&quot;  ('72-'79) ever had Air Conditioners.

&gt; Yes, 2 main models, the VW Cool installation or a DPD unit, the &quot;COOL&quot; installationwas either ducts above drivers/passengers heads in regular van or under dash
unit in Westy, the DPD is a nicer under dash unit with 2 blower fans.  Condensors
under center of bus on either and possible under front in front of axle as well.
DPD condensor with nice louvered steel gaurd, VW usually plaster metal lath screen.
Both typically have a couple of 12V fans on the main condensor, a good problem place
to check if you get a whine when you turn it on or if inefective sitting still.
Oh, some early Westy ('72 - '75) had a funky one that vented on top of the cabinets on 
the left side I'm not sure who made that one.

&gt; If they did, are they effective?

I have both under dash installations, the VW is pitifull, the DPD slightly better
than pitiful, I have been informed the ceiling unit no better.  Too much volume
too little air moved even though they recycle, plus it kills engines.  Frankly
though I do admit the under dash units can keep the front passengers in a Westy
almost comfortable on a 95F day.  Both use archaic York compressors on brackets
mounted to the left rear of the T4 near the oil filter, a pulley behind the fan pulley 
is the drive with an idler on the belt for tension, the belt is often a
very odd long thin size, which I will measure and post some time.  The VW bracket
system is nicer and more easily adjustable.  No installation I have ever seen has made
a very good attempt at sealing the hole in the shroud cut for the compressor a
critical error IMHO.  I have seen maybe 8 vans with these installations and owned
3.

&gt; Anyone ever tried to retrofit one?

&gt; Here would be my rec, make sure engine is solid, find the DPD underdash unit andcondensors off a junkyard bus (not too tough actually)  Call ICE systems (advertise
in the mags for years) they want about $400 last I checked for a modern rotary
Sankyo pump with mounts and maybe hose.  Retrofit will not be too tough.  They will
likely want you to go 134A I would not reccomend it as marginal as the system is it
needs the extra capacity of R12, even with the cost.  And tint your windows and leave
windows down when out of the car.  In 100+F degree weather I really doubt any system
is going to work.


&gt; Thanks!
