Hi Listers,
    I have a question for everyone.  Today, acting on the rumor that =
their was a good VW &quot;junkyard and shop&quot; app. 80 miles from me, I headed =
off to check it out.  Well, it wasn't a GREAT yard, but a pretty neat =
shop.  In a storage shed behind this guys shop sat a 74 Westy.  Very =
good shape as far as I could tell.  Absolutely no rust, complete =
interior (no rips, tears or rough places!), canvas was there, but could =
not tell the condition as the top was down, 4 flat tires, engine was =
missing some tin, but otherwise complete.  The owner, who the shop had =
done work for in the past, cruised in about 4 years ago with this thing =
and just left.  Told the shop owner that it was blowing oil and wanted =
it fixed.  Never showed back up.  In fact, he has disappeared from this =
city entirely owing the shop app. $600 for previous work.  That means =
that the shop does not have the title.  The shop owner has tried to =
locate the owner with no luck.  The shop wants to recoup its loss and =
recover the money the guy owes them, so he offered to sell me the van =
for the $600, if we can do something about the title.  The DMV is closed =
here.  They are in the Eastern side of the state in another time zone.  =
I will call tomorrow to see what can be done, but has anyone on the list =
had any dealings of this type?  Are there any &quot;quirks&quot; with a 74 model =
that I need to know about?  I hope something can be worked out.  I hate =
to see a van this restorable sit there and rot away from neglect.

Thanks for all the help!
Brian Hayes
