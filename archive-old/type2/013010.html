Well I hope the EZE-Outs work and I have one other suggestion.

I'm shure that you've got all of the krudd out of the sockets by now.

In a last ditch effort!

Take the next size (oversize) allen or domestic size wrench and grind the
six sides down enough to make the wrench a drive in fit.

You need one of your bolts in a vise to test the drive in fit, but It
will get them out as lik a last resort.

Cut the rubber off of the CV's , you're going to replace it anyway, Make
shure you're aimed at the bolt socket and brive the newly fabricated
allen into the socket. Then start un-screwing.

If this doesn't do it you're down to driling them out.
