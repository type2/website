Subject: Spirited Dizzcusion

All,

The SVDA thread was very interesting and informative. There are still 
points that need meditation (mulling over) which is good because the 
list should be thought provoking and spirited. Today a shiny rebuilt 
205T vac dizzy makes it reappearance in on the 1600 SP/30pict motor 
in the bus. I can hardly wait.

Good-bye 009 it has been great knowing you and I hope you like your 
new home in the spare parts box. I am sure you will rest peacefully 
there with the DP manifold boots and the carb rebuild kit.
