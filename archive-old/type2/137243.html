Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Air Oil Bath Warm/Cool Flow Control Gizmo

&gt;indeed, you actually get less horsepower with hot air than you do with cold 
&gt;

Thanks. So, if I'm thinking about this correctly, the plug is not 
expanding as the vehicle warms up, so I am always taking in warm air ... 
which gives less power... which may be why she seems to run better cold 
than she does once she fully warms up (stalling a little bit on idle -- 
but only once sufficiently warmed up; no problem cold). Then perhaps 
disconnecting the line and plugging the hole, as recommended in the 
Library, and leaving it permanent is the solution?  I take it, for 
reasons of flow, I only plug the tin's hole and not the line that 
connects to the tin there? Please let me know if this makes sense or if 
I am not thinking about this correctly.

While I'm at it, maybe I should also wire up that weighted flap, eh? Is 
there any reason I shouldn't? Tins I have seen tend to have them wired 
all the way up, and the Library article speaks to this as well.

Many Thanks,
