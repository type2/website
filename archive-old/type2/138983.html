&gt; I have Bentley on CD ROM. My instruction page on this setting is the
&gt; 4th supplement USA, printed 12/73. It has 3 different parameters to
&gt; adjust for pump volume. Does your Bentley have this same procedure?

Good idea. The workshop manual has different values than Bentley. That
solves the acc. pump problem.

&gt; My edition of Bentley gives no permission to bend the tab actually,
&gt; differing from many other carb designs. Chilton actually says you
&gt; jepordize proper needle seating if you bend the tab. Per other posts,
&gt; the only legal method of adjusting float is the washers, but you said
&gt; you already have the smallest one available (0.5mm) and you leak
&gt; without it.

I agree.
 
&gt; You have a suggestion to check gasket interference to report back on,
&gt; so I will await those results. There is some confusion on this post:

I didn't make enough difference. It's still 2mm off.
 
&gt; My original impression was that you were getting fuel level too low
&gt; because float was closing needle valve prematurely.

Yes.

&gt; But this paragraph
&gt; suggests your float is hanging up and not rising to shut off needle
&gt; valve. But if that were the case, your bowl would overflow rather than
&gt; be too low. I must be missing something different you tried here. I
&gt; can't see any other reasons why your float would refuse to rise unless
&gt; you are using a replacement float and it is geometrically different
&gt; from the original float.

If you try to bend the tab.

&gt; It would be equal to the weight of the additional fuel you wish to
&gt; displace (the amount of fuel it takes to bring your bowl level within
&gt; spec).

My measurements and calculations say that I'd require an extra 3g. This the
float only weigh 7g in the first place this seems excessive.

&gt; Well, I was visiting a local VW guru, and he had acquired a weber
&gt; setup for his oval project very cheap or free because of broken pot
&gt; metal on the top section. He repaired it with JB Weld. I couldn't
&gt; believe it and told him I didn't know JB weld was fuel resistant. He
&gt; said he has been using it for years in that application. If you don't
&gt; feel comfortable with it, FLAPS and even Wal-mart sell other epoxies
&gt; that are certified for radiator and gas tank repair.

Another Richard suggested Loctite. When I looked into the details #609 is
fuel resistant.
