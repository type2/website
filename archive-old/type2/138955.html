&gt; I picked up some reflective tape from Wally World the other day.  It was on
&gt; mark-down sale, so they may be discontinuing it.  I got some white and some

&gt; (what's the proper name for that belt around the bus anyway).  Not sure what
&gt; to do with the red yet.

White (silver actually) looks good on the rear bumper. At night it's
impossible to ignore and in the daytime nobody knows it's there:

There's no mistaking the red/white combo but I think white on it's own is
effective and doesn't leave your bus looking like it belongs in a
contruction zone.
