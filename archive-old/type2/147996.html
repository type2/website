Subject: Re: [T2] BreakFluid Cap / Transmission question

 &gt;Sounds like the 3rd Gear Synchronizer is going bad, but it could be the
shifter base needs a slight realignment/adjustment.

See the www.type2_dot_com library for instructions

 &gt;Or the shift coupler in
the rear has developed too much play and needs replacing.

The other thing that needs to be checked is the little rubber ring 
that at the front of the shift linkage (can't remember the name) that 
reduces slop in the gearstick. It tends to wear out and fall off 
after 25-30 years!

Cheers,

Martin
