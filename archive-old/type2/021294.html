&gt; &gt; 2. My bus originally had AC and the condensers are mounted between the frame
&gt; &gt; members (under the cargo floor) with a 12v fan blowing down through it. There
&gt; &gt; is a galvanized cover running between the members that is louvered open
&gt; &gt; towards the front of the bus.  Looks like an ideal spot for the radiator - run
&gt; &gt; the fan all the time.  Any thoughts? Will she cool with a stock jap rad?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. There is some talk of using the suby bellhousing.  Why?  Won't the adapter
&gt; &gt; plate allow me to mate the engine right up to the tranny?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Exhaust. Am I looking at a complete fabrication?  Something like this looks
&gt;
&gt; Quick question: how are you doing your radiator?

Clark, Jim:
I've thought about conversions for a long time. Hobert Kennedy always said the
radiator needs to be in front in the air flow. The NICEST setup would be to get the
nose, radiator, and heater assembly from a Mexican bus. Salvage yards are pretty
bare of these things, but I wonder what NEW parts would cost? Any Mexican listees
with access to a parts book? Hmmm... I wonder if I could get a waterboxer to fit in
the 69 double cab?
