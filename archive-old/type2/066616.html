All,

&gt;I HAVE seen the blue/green plaid stool as well as the console.

intersting never seen a plaid stool

&gt;Perhaps the stool was in '74 and the console in '75?

dunno like most things vw (and vw) there always seem to be exceptions to
the &quot;rule&quot; especially as old product lines were running out and new ones
being introduced. It seems the case that vw/westy basically put a hodge
podge of parts together for those transitional cars.
