Wow!

The only help I can offer regards the inside rearview mirror. That mirror
was put there specifically to observe all the stuff shuffling around back
there so you can determine immediately whether that &quot;thump&quot; was luggage
induced. If not, you could look out the sideview mirrors to see your muffler
sparking down the road.

You don't need that rearview to tell that there's gonna be someone crawling
up your _at_$$, because that's a given.

But seriously folks... Nope. It's not illegal to move your rearview mirror
down. The one in my 1969 Westy hangs quite low, and is actually usable,
though I don't have the hard cabinet back there.

Good luck on the oil thing!

&gt; -  Mirror #2!  My rear view mirror shows me a great view of the storage
&gt; compartment above the bed.  I could duck down a little bit and kinda see
&gt; the cars behind me, but not as well as I'd like.  If I were to place
&gt; that same mirror down about 2-3 inches I'd get a much better view?  Has
&gt; anyone done this?  Is it legal to have a low hanging mirror?  What about
&gt; a third party mirror?  Or should I just use that one to keep track of my
&gt; dog in the back seat?
