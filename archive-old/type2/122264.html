Subject: stranded in SC Engine removed update

My engine is out. Wasn't as bad as I thought.
Could definitely do it a lot faster next time.
Removed the torque converter to have a look.
Definitely leaking from the seal.
Also, looks like the torque converter is broken. The ring that the bushing 
is inside of seems to be broken off.
So, is there anyone who has an extra torque converter for an auto tranny? It 
is for a 79.
I've been stranded in this town and used up all my money, but if someone can 
help me out I will be more than happy to send them $ sometime next month 
after I get home and then go back to FL and have a chance to work a little 
there.
I need to get out of this town.
Thanks so much to everyone who has helped me get this far.

Kyle
