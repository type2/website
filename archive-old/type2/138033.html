&lt;&lt; Hello Guys   Not so fast  porsche makes most of its money doing research 
and 
delvelopement for other companies including farm and air crafts, besides cars 
. They made a couple of models of tractors in the late 60's. just as there 
were VW tractors  A company call Butietiz  (SP)      or something spell like 
that 
  had a 40 hp motor mounted in the front, look a lot like the international 
Cub  but not as high in the air.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
