Hi Gente,

I just swapped my 1600'cc engine for an T4 2000'cc and i have a T2 77' German 
model. I guess i'll have some kind of more torque using this engine with my T2 
gearbox due to the relation between the high rev's of the 1600' and the kind of 
slower rev's of the 2000'cc. That means that i'm probaly gonna get more power out 
of less rev's than with a 1600'cc? Does anyone confirm that? Also i think if i put 
on a larger tire this relation will get kind of normal again. 

Michel
