Subject: 69 Single Cab

Well, I'm well on my way down the slippery slope of bus madness.
Saturday afternoon Chris and I hauled off  my newest accquistion, a '69
Single Cab.  I suppose it's cliche, but I had always told myself I
wouldn't get into buses unless I found a deal on a single or double cab,
of course when I finally give in and go for the '68 Adventurewagen, the
single cab pops up under my nose six days later.  I'm  chest deep in
projects, but I couldn't  pass it up.   After many long, passionate
discussions about the single cab with my wife ( which have motivated
Chris to deny anything but passing involvement in the single cab), I did
the deed last Tuesday.

The rain stopped long enough to allow us to strap the single cab onto a
Uhaul tow dolly (rear up) and take it off to it's temporary resting
spot, the home of a very kind and generous bus soul who is watching over
it until I can get it roadworthy (needs engine and brake work).  This
arrangement  has allowed me to get the single cab without having to
sleep in the back of it, the wife wasn't gonna go for a dead bus in the
back yard.

Today I accomplished my first solo engine pull, went very well except
for the d*#n gas line.  Loosened the clamp, pencil at the ready, pulled
hose off, swiftly inserted pencil, but even after tightening back down
on the clamp was only able to slow the flow to a moderate trickle.  The
end of the hose was dry, brittle, and crumbling around the pencil.
Tried a couple other items (bolt, phillips screwdriver) without any
better luck.  Finally used a small C clamp to mash down on the hose to
stop the flow.  This worked until I brushed up againist the clamp while
loosening the upper engine/transmission bolt and caused the section of
hose at the C clamp to crumble completely apart.  Quickly installed
another C clamp further up the line, then siphoned all the fuel (10
gallons!) out of the tank.  I hope replacing the line from the bottom of
the tank won't be difficult.

With the engine out I plan to replace the engine seals, fuel lines,
clean up the tin, and track down a steady leak that developed after I
adjusted the valves.

Later,
