Subject: Re: [T2] 73' Carburator options?

I spent $260 to have my stock Solexes rebuilt, and they were NOT SCOTTISH 
(i.e., they were crrrrrrap)! I could've done better myself, tyro that I am,
  and for a lot less dinero.

As I learned the hard way, 73s were jetted differently than 74s (my carb guys 
did not know this). You can tell the 74s by the little plastic doo-dad on 
the accelerator pump (at the lower front of the carb--I knew this).

For $350, you oughta be able to find a pair of REALLY GOOD replacement Solexes.

Or you could get Webers or Dellortos. But then when something goes wrong, and 
you look it up in the Bentley, the pictures won't match (my excuse for going 
stock).

&gt; alright..my buddy has a type4engine thats in a 73transporter. through the 
&gt; lists advice, and of course common sense, we've realized that he needs new 
&gt; carbs. or the one's he has rebuilt.
&gt; so i was wondering, what u experienced vw owners would recommend doing here?
&gt;  should he rebuild his old 34dual-carbs? or should he put out the green energy 
&gt; and buy some new lungs?
&gt; now, if his best investment is goin with new ones, then what would be the 
&gt; cheapest but better route to go with here? and the catch is, he's lookin 
&gt; at only bein able to spend, probably at the most, 350$.
&gt; thanks for your time and attention, and for any help that u can pass our 
&gt; way.
