Subject: RE: [T2] convert hydraulic to solid

Reverse that..... hydraulic are steel.
And the rockers have springs between them w/solids,
spacers and wave washers w/hydraulics.

 Ohh oohh I can answer this one.
 
 Will yeah the pushrods for hydraulic and solid
 lifters are different. Easy
 way to tell, use a magnet to the middle of the tube.
 If the magnet sticks,
 it's a hydraulic rod. The solid lifter rods were
 aluminum in the middle
 sections with steel tips.
 
 That right? Or do I have it the wrong way around? I
 think that's right.
