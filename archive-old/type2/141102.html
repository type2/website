Sam,

Tire salespeople are just that. They will sell you whatever they have on sale 
and can make the biggest commision on. You bus REQUIRES a MINIMUM 
load rating of 1540 lbs per tire. You CANNOT get this on a P rated passenger tire.
You need either a reinforced sidewall tire or a commercial tire. The CORRECT size tire 
for your bus is 185R14 w/reinforced sidewalls or 185R14C. The C means commercial. 
Notice there is NO middle aspect number. That is correct. Most salesman think you are 
stupid and you left the 75 out. Wrong! Most salesman will tell you there is no such size as 
185R14. Wrong!

Your friendly tire sales people are on crack telling you to get HydroEdge tires.
1) they are NOT available in 185R14
they are ONLY available in 185/65 14. 185/70 14 and 195/70 14
The ONLY tire close to a 185R14 is a 195/75R14.  That 70 is NOT close.
and
2) the load weight of those three may-pops are 1124, 1201, and 1312 lbs.
THESE are passenger car tires!!!

But, hey, they are round black and hold air. Your bus and your life. Your choice.

A word of advice:
Tires are like oil. There is a million posts about them IN THE ARCHIVES.
When you signed up for this list, you 1st got the charter of this list. The FIRST paragraph
says:  &quot;This is the charter of the type2 list. Welcome to the list! You MUST
READ this document and agree to abide by it if you want to stay on the list.&quot;

With that in mind, as you scroll down the charter, you will see this under Etiquette:

--Search the List Archive and the Technical Resource Library. 
In other words, consult the extensive resources available to
you at www.type2_dot_com before asking on the list. You will get more
information faster that way. If you ask frequently asked questions
(FAQs) or frequently annoying recurring threads (FARTS), people will be
inclined to ignore you or become caustic.

We JUST went thru a BIG discussion on tires......and I said I would smack myself in the head 
if I ever answered another tire FART.   SMACK   OUCH!

Matt just posted to the list last Saturday that The VintageBus and Type2 mailing list archives at
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive have been updated with messages through early May, 2005.

PLEASE use them!!!!

&lt;End of rant&gt;
