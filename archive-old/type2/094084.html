Subject: Re: [T2] RE: I weighed my bus

Hi Volks,

I would be interested to see the numbers putting just *one* wheel on the
scale and then having two people simulate a cross-wind by pushing really
hard on the opposite side of the bus.

I'd be willing to bet that crosswinds, braking and cornering loads can
increase the weight transferred to a particular wheel very substantially;
which would account for the load rating.

My bus has handled so much better since I got a decent set of Continentals.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; 1.) Carrying extra gear/people.  I've been know to put 300-400 pounds
&gt;&gt; behind my rear seat and another 600-800 pounds in the floorboard.  This is
&gt;&gt; bound to increase the rear axle weight from 1860 to 2500 or more.
&gt; 
&gt; Getting close to the structural limit of the bus according to the doorjam.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 4.) The ever-popular and always-feard cross-wind and blow-by from freight
&gt;&gt; trucks (and Suburban drivers who are convinced that triple digit speeds are
&gt;&gt; safe).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any of these conditions will increase the weight on one or more of your
&gt;&gt; tires.
&gt;&gt; But when you start stacking these conditions together, you can see why you
&gt;&gt; really need some tires that'll handle 1.5 to 2.0 times the empty weight of
&gt;&gt; your 
&gt;&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Good points.  Is the GAWR values on the doorjam are to be adhered to then a
&gt; 1400 lbs spec tire at maximum inflation would be almost at it's limit when
&gt; the bus is fully loaded, and that's standing still.
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess the rule of thumb is to use D load range tires if you plan to
&gt; totally load your bus down regularly if you worry about safety.  My
&gt; experience has been a loaded down bus handles better anyway. ;-)
