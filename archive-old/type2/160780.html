&gt;VJR4BR18 = Bosch 0231 129 022, replaced by Bosch 0231 129 031.  Originally
&gt;fits Early 60s Porsche 356 and 67-69 Porsche 912.
&gt;
&gt;VJR4BR18 - Timed at 7.5 BTDC _at_ 900rpm
&gt;2800rpm = 30 degrees advance
&gt;
&gt;...........for which the distributor is designed for.

Options:
Is it cast iron?? I have an 022 and it is iron and most of the VJ's I 
have seen are iron as well. If so, worth big bucks.
When I bought my 912 in '88, they were still available new for $680.

Can be rebuilt.  Even if the shaft is worn, it can be turned true and 
custom bushings reamed to fit.
Can be custom adjusted for advance.
The advance weight stops can be modified to allow less advance.
They are fitted with lock screws and slots that provide for these adjustments.
The weights can be lightened to slow the curve.
There are at least several spring sets available as well.

Bad News:

Even on the Mercedes unit I put in my 912, I sanded down the No. 3 
lobe to retard for the VW/Porsche A/C
application. Don't provide this and you will wear out No. 3 prematurely.

It will take many iterations of disassembly, modify, reassemble, 
install and test run with a timing light to dial it in for a home shop.

If the weight pivot pins are worn I wouldn't bother. Same if the 
points cam lobes show scouring, grooving.
