Subject: Home made 70amp alternator cooling boot

Hello List,

I am in the process of upgrading the stock charging
system in my bus to the 70amp setup. I needed a 70amp
alternator cooling boot but it appears that none are
currently available. I knew that I had to make
somthing that would work. I ended up using the torn
rubber boot from my old brake booster. To do this
modification, I took the old 55amp (&quot;D&quot; shaped)
cooling boot and used scissors to cut of the part of
the boot with the &quot;D&quot; shaped clamp. I then trimmed off
the enlarged ends on both sides of the brake booster
boot. The booster boot now fits perfectly on the 70amp
alternator cooling port. Next I trimmed the the old
alternator boot so that the booster boot fit snugly on
the end. I use a needle and some strong thread to sew
the 2 pieces together. They went together perfectly
with no visible gaps or leaks in the seam. I am going
to seal the seam with automotive silicone. I will
install it tomorrow. I will just use the appropriate
size hose clamp to secure the boot to the 70amp
alternator. This project took me less than 30min to
do. Here are some pictures of the finished product.

Wish me luck. It is not as cobbed up as it looks. With
a little luck, may be it will fit with out problems
and hold up for a good while.

Thanks!
