Subject: Re: [T2] Weber ICT34 jets and fuel tank sender replacement

&gt;First, I'm about to replace my good ol' Weber progressive with a pair of Weber
&gt;34 ICTs I picked up of the unnamed auction site. The 34s came off a dual-port
&gt;upright (I even have the manifolds if anyone is interested in them). Should I
&gt;expected to have to reject these puppies? If so, anybody have the jet sizes
&gt;handy?

If they came off of a 1600cc and they are going on a 160cc engine, then I 
expect the jets could stay the same.

Why not gain 2-3 HP and go with dual port heads. Surely you could find a 
set used and cheap.

I always try to move to better parts when I can. Not slamming your choice 
of heads though. I've had a couple SP Beetle engines too.
