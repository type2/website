Thanks, Mike! No problemo.

I do believe the 72 bumpers are the same as the 68-71. The bumpers
changed to the square ones in 73. The rear brackets are interchangeable
at the frame (I have a 68-72 bumper on the rear of 73) but the 73-on
front is totally different (as I learned when I was going to get a front
bush-basher from Dr. Pepper's 72).

Ironically, you could have my rear bumper brackets if I could just that
right one off. But I've got the dreaded trapped nut syndrome and the
bolt just turns and turns. Drastic measures are called for. Hmph.

The good news is the German window seals are in at WCM and I'm picking
up two of them tomorrow (I'm being optimistic -- ya'd think I'd know
better by now). I'll know by the end of tomorrow if I'll have a back
side window installed or not.

P.S. I remember that I had a junkyard windshield installed in a 64
B_at_rr_at_cuda I had about 20 years ago, and the labor cost me about $20.

&gt; Hey all-
&gt; My next project is to get the bumper on.
&gt; Missing the Drivers Side and I believe the 72 is different from all
&gt; the rest is it not?
&gt; 
&gt; So if you have one you would be willing to part with...
&gt; Drop me a line
&gt; 
&gt; Next I'll be rebuilding the stock carbs and looking for oil leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; (Last week I missed out on a rebuilt set of carbs and an oil bath air
&gt; cleaner for a '72 on ebay, looked good but a guy named Mr. Westy beat
&gt; me in the closing minutes) - still bummed about that.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for the help on the dipstick measurements, and Big Thanks
&gt; to Nikki for the '73 Air Box
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
