&gt; &gt; #3. Tint.  The PO's tint is peeling in places, and it's too light for my
&gt; &gt; taste.  Since the bus is red, I'll spring for the so-dark-it's-barely-
&gt; &gt; legal red-tinged tint.  It'll reduce the bus's inside temp after sitting
&gt; &gt; in the sun too.
&gt;
&gt; Another way to reduce inside temps is to install a full-length luggage
&gt; rack with a solid floor to shade the roof of the bus.  I use a sheet of
&gt; 1/4 inch plywood on mine.  Good for about a 10F reduction on a hot day.
