&gt; Has anyone seen the stock oil galley plugs anywhere? I would like to stake
&gt; some new ones back in with out all the hassle of tapping the galleys for
&gt; threaded plugs.Any ideas on what to use for a sealer around the edges if
&gt; stock ones are available??

I think that it would be just about as easy to tap the holes as it is to
put in new plugs  That's one of those jobs that is best done &quot;right first
time&quot;
