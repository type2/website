&gt; well went to try to crank the bus and she tunrned and turned but never
fired....
&gt;
&gt; i went back and checked the advance/retard on the dizzy and smelled gas
really bad and asap undid the battery cable from the battery....

Bad idea to disconnect the battery in this situation.
There can be a very small spark at either terminal
when removing cables, it only takes one to do it.

Better to flood the engine with water first to neutralize
the fuel, then disconnect the battery.

Look for a stuck float, float cracked and filling with fuel, or
a stuck fuel inlet valve, which will drain all gas supplied by gravity
until the supply is deleted. Check the oil level and by smell.
The excess fuel will flood the engine ( no start ) and go into
the oil past the rings.
