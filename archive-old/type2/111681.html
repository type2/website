&gt; &gt;The cone gasket is still available from VW for under $5 and *must* be

&gt; The 022 133 073A gasket has been NLA from the VW dealer for a long
&gt; time.

True, alas.

&gt; What is still available is the late Vanagon gasket, 025 133 073A. It
&gt; looks very similar in size and shape with the only differences I can
&gt; see being that it has more ribs along the circumference and there 3
&gt; small cutouts at the perimeter are missing.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone tried using this gasket? There's a lot in stock still and
&gt; the rubber is like new.

Richard,

I have used 3-4 of these in different bay and vanagon applications.  It is
the gasket I was referring to in my post.  As far as I can tell, the slope
and diameter of the cone on both the air distribution box and the throttle
body appears to me never to have changed, even on the digifont engines.
I'd love to have one next to a NOS Bay gasket, but I doubt you would find
one :-(
