Subject: Re: Shift plate? (was Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace)

Hmm, most mistakes are to put the plate in wrong side left?  The edge of
the plate is the fulcrum against which the shift lever causes the
rotational movement of the long shift rod.  How is your 2nd gear
compared to reverse?

 I've always known
&gt; of a plate down there of some kind and have always wondered if I am missing
&gt; something like, as I have never - since I've owned my bus - had to push down
&gt; while shifting into reverse; always just a smooth horizontal pull to the
&gt; left and smoothly down.  I just always thought I was lucky not to have to
&gt; deal with it.  Is this something I really need?
