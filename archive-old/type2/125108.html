Subject: Re: [T2] tail light removal

It is held in place with four 8mm nuts, you get to them from the inside of
the engine compartment.

&gt; I need to remove the tail light housing from my '79.
&gt;
&gt; I removed the lens, but its not obvious (to me) how to proceed next.
&gt; I'd prefer not to destroy it, so I thought I'd inquire first. How does
&gt; one get it out?
