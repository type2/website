Yep, shorting a battery lets off a lot of enery very quickly

The garage accross the road from where I work tried to jump start a car
using a big battery they kept just for that. Unfortunatly they connected
it the wrong way round. The resulting short circuit blew the corner and 
terminal off the battery with a very load bang...

With regard to preventing battery shorts and to enable quick disconnects
we have on sale in the UK quick release connectors. Instead of a bolt on 
connector they work by a lever clamping action. 

The lever is integral with a plastic housing (one red, one blue) that 
covers and insulates the terminal completely. It also has a half way 
setting to allow anything to be connected by crocodile clips (jump leads, 
inspection lamp etc).

In the event of a fire these are very easy to disconnect. They are also 
sufficiently easy to give you no excuse for not disconnecting the battery
while you do that electrical job.

The cost over here is about 10 UK pounds ($15 US) for a pair - you will 
be more likely to find them in a caravan center than an auto-shop. 

I can let UK folk know where to get them if they mail me. Any-one know 
where for you boys and girls in the USA?
