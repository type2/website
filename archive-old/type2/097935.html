&lt;&lt; GEX has probably driven more VW/people to give up on VW's than any single
group or person (rant off)  I would put the blame first on the folks at
GEX.   &gt;&gt;

I had a free GEX engine some years ago (a mechanic friend got two shipped
to his address by a customer...) Lasted a month in my ol' '71...
Any spies out there who actually know the rebuild process at GEX ? I 
know there's no 'legal' definition of rebuild so they can get away with
practically anything, but I'm just curious if there is a process at all...?-(
