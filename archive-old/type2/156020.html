Subject: Re: [T2] Re: The Hubcap

&gt; hey Mike  Lets hope so. but it also sounds like he is the reason it  hasn't
&gt; been seen ??later  Mark D
&gt;

That's my thinking too. And even though I've never seen the thing in
person (was really hoping it would come up here to Denver) I'm gonna
throw my opinion out anyway.

The way the current holder of the chalice (errr... hubcap) worded the
message, it was like, &quot;Deal with it. I'm gonna do what I want to it.
You'll see it when I'm good and ready to show it to you.&quot;
