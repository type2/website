Subject: Re: [T2] City Water Hookup

On 10/23/01 5:59 AM, wilden1_at_juno_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;I've never hooked up the city water to my Westy in the seven years that
&gt;I've owned it until the other day. The city water won't flow through my
&gt;Westy faucet. As always my 12v pump works just fine but the city water
&gt;won't flow through the faucet. Are there any tricks, regulators etc that
&gt;are required?

Can't say for sure on an '83, but on my '78 there's a valve you need to 
turn. IIRC it's on the sink, close to the faucet. Turning it one way 
gives you 12v, the other city. Or maybe it's just an open/close sort of 
valve. I've only used it to test functionality, never actually used it in 
a camp scenario, which is why I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, check for 
other handles around the sink/faucet area, that's probably where it'd be 
on an '83.
