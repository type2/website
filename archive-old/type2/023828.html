the thing under the dash with the cover and cap that screws off is the washer 
fluid container, and the max pressure sticker is because you have to pump up 
pressure for it to work.    the button with the &quot;B&quot; is the Brake Warning 
light, if it lights when you use the brakes you have a brake failure, it 
lights when you press it so you can test to see if its working.
