        Since it's Friday I thought I'd ask this.  How do I find out what
kind of camper bus I have?  I know it's a camper cause the VIN#'s in the
bentley match my bus #'s.  Anyway, it's a '69 hardtop, walkthrough, with
pull out bench seat into bed, and all of the camper material.  Any help on
how to find out would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Keri
