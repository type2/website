Subject: Cheap Lights...

I am sad to report that I have fallen victim to over eagerness on the
cheap lights. I was promised a steal of a deal on the lights, however when
it actually came time to acquire the lights the price suddenly jumped to
the point where it is really not worth my while to purchase them. (The
price being offered now doesn't even beat what some of the same items have
been going for on *bay!)

Of course the price goes down to something reasonable (not cheap, but
reasonable) if I want to order 1000 pairs or so. Since this is not likely,
I am afraid *bay may be your best bet.

Sorry to have raised all of your hopes and wasted your bandwidth.
