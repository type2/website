Subject: Re: [T2] Freeing up a stuck engine 1500SP

&gt; What lubricant, motor oil?
&gt; Penetrating oil? Something else??

I had good luck with PB Blaster on an old Toyota engine. Really, most
any penetrating oil will probably work. The key is time.

You will NOT be able to do this in a day.

Make sure there's oil in the crankcase.

Pull the plugs, spray a good amount of PBBlaster in the cylinders. Go
to bed. In the morning do it again. But this time give the engine a
little tug. No gorilla action, just enough that if everything was
perfect it would barely turn.

Do this for a few days. If after a week you don't see any movement at
all you can start using muscle to break it loose. Not because it's a
good idea, but because if a week of soaking in PB didn't loosen it you
don't have much to lose. ;-)

I've heard stories of folks who unstuck an engine with similar methods
and got thousands and thousands of miles out of them. The Toyota
engine I did it to is still on the road after 3 years...
