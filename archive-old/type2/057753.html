Subject: Re: NEEDED: crossover pipe and EGR Filter

&gt;The VW shop around here said it
&gt;was discontinued.  they can get
&gt;it, but it will cost $400

&gt;It [EGR filter] is also discontinued,
&gt;and to get a used one, the shop
&gt;said it would be ~$250.

Casey:

First, stop going to that VW shop - it sounds like they are really
wanting to HAVE you.

The pipe you're describing sounds like what is more commonly referred to
as the &quot;Y-pipe&quot; - it has three connection flanges, plus the EGR
connection, right?

A replacement for that piece is available, priced around $65 I think.

The EGR filters are even harder to find, but I think that Ron Salmon, at
the Bus Depot, ( http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ ) recently said he's got some,
for $129 each.
