Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Head

Since AVP is generally well regarded I'd be interested in knowing exactly
what the problem turns out to be here.

However, a &quot;good&quot; head - rebuilt or not - really should work right out of
the box so I wouldn't be too happy with a solution that says, in effect,
l&quot;et the parts wear into spec.&quot;  Components are supposed to be in spec when
installed; the engine probably *will* get better as it breaks in, but should
still work properly on first startup.  Besides, didn't AVP do a &quot;hot run&quot; of
the engine after assembly?  (I seem to remember this is part of their
process, though I may be wrong.)

&gt; I've got a new AVP head that's leaking down 50% on the exhaust valve. I've
got some grave concerns about install it and hoping it will fix itself.
&gt;
&gt; The best suggestion I've heard so far is that the valve guide maybe tight
and after breakin the valve will seat properly. Opinions?
