Subject: Re: List Coffee Mug???

I, also, am a non-coffee drinker, but that does not mean I am caffiene
free.  I would like to suggest a fourth alternative, which is the
&quot;co-pilot&quot; sized, insullated, 1 liter mug and cap that some Seven-Elevens
used to sell.  While the captain's cup design is probably handier, I have
a preference for quantity. :-)
