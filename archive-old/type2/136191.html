Subject: Re: 55 mph speed limit

&gt; It blows my mind when I hear about people
talking about cruising at 70mph all the time in
their bus. 

Well.... there is 70 mph and there is 70 mph.  My
speedo now reads correct with LT27/8.50/14 tires.
 I've verified it with GPS and also with police
radar.  The speed was REALLY optimistic with the
stock size tire.   I suspect others are suffering
from these symptoms.
