Subject: Adjusting front wheel bearings

In a recent exchange with Sami, regarding his grinds and growls, I said
that my technique for adjusting the front wheel bearings on my late '70's
busses hearks back to my '60's bug days in that I tend to tighten up on
the adjusting nut till the wheel binds a bit, then back off til I can
*just* move the washer under the nut.  Knowing this is not the Bentley
procedure, I would like positive/negative opinions on it.  I have never
had bearing problems using it (other than the time I failed to drive the
inner race completely home :-), but I am curious what the rest of you (who
don't own a dial mike) do.
