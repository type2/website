Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre braking

Last fall I did the complete brake job on my '70 bus, but starting in the 
winter I had some braking problems.  Occasionally, the bus would pull 
violently to the left when I braked.  OK, I thought, a leaking cylinder.  I 
pulled the front wheels, but everything looked dry and tight.   After I put 
it all back together, the brakes worked fine for awhile, but soon, the same 
thing started to happen.  Plus, I lost some brake fluid, though I could not 
find any leak, but then the fluid stayed level for a long time.  The braking 
continues to act up intermittently.   I'm at wits end.  Any thoughts?

Thanks.
Jerry

Jerry,

I too have a '70 (no calipers or booster BTW) and have had a similar 
occurrence.  Mine turned out to be what you expected: a bad front WhCyl.  
The interesting thing was, that the fluid was leaking into the 
cylinder-boot, and not beyond it.  Peel back all the boots and make sure 
that there isn't any fluid inside of them.  I replaced all of my cylinders 
AND hoses just to be safe.  Brakes like a champ now.  I would also recommend 
that you change ALL of your brake fluid while you're doing the job.  CLean 
brake fluid=happy brake parts.
