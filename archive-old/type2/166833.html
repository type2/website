  this....WRONG, Now: Brake backing plate

Richard,
Thanks for the information. I called my mechanic and left him a message about
the backing plates. I really appreciate the knowledge that is passed amongst
this group, it makes having this bus all the more fun!

 VW changed the hardware mid 74 (VIN 214 2057 730) and eliminated the  
 hole. You'll also find a lot of backing plates for sale (Brazil,  
 Germany) have these holes. It can get wet back there so cover up the  
 holes.
 
 IIRC, Dolan once told me that he preferred not to use the retaining  
 springs even on the older models. He used to be the brake guru when  
 he was active on the list.
