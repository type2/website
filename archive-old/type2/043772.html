Subject: [T2] Re: Intermittent red light on

Clara and others have said to check the belt, connections, generator
brushes, which is a good idea.  The manuals also describe tests for gen
and voltage reg that require at least a voltmeter -- another good idea.

My 71 was doing the same thing, mostly noticeable at night (light
sometimes on, sometimes not, variable intensity but eventually clearly
increasing with engine speed).  Finally drained the battery.  I replaced
the regulator and it seems to have solved the problem (time will tell
for sure).

Another thing to check is your wiring connections.  I had a similar
problem on my 6V '60 Ghia, and it wasn't the voltage regulator (I now
have a great spare).  After dealing with the dim-red-light-always-on
problem for close to a year, it turned out that tightening the
screw-terminal connections on the ignition switch and light switch took
care of the problem -- so that's another possibility, though less of an
issue with push-on connectors in these more Modren Loaveses.
