Subject: Looking for hubcaps

Hi everybody,

     I am looking for a set of late bay hubcaps fro my 82 Westy.  I like the
simple design &amp; the price compared to even one of thse plastic things that
was on my camper.  I would like a really nice set.  If anyone has these, let
me know how much &amp; when we can get them shipped to me.  Thanks.
