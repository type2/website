	$4500 isn't too much for a perfect '76 Westie.
	Figure the perfect '76 is worth $2K and the Westie stuff
is worth another $2K, and $500 either way, since its perfect,
isn't a surprise. Offer $4K cash and see if they take it.

	Someone else might sell something almost as good for half that,
of course, and someone else might buy it and enjoy it as if it
were pefect. Life isn't fair. Or the half-price version might
need $8K work by other people's skilled hands to get up to
perfect. Or you might spend $10K worth of your time learning
how to fix up a Westie to make it perfect. Or you might spend
$0 of your time because you have time to spare, and $500 on
parts, make some new friends and be happy.

	If you want to know the range of prices for vehicles, asking
this list and so forth is a good idea. If you want to know
whether a given $4500 vehicle will make you instantly gratified
you've got to know the vehicle VERY well before you spend the
money. Know yourself too. And the answer is probably no anyway. 

	No vehicle is 'perfect' and just like you choose your friends 
for their faults, not their virtues, you should pick your vehicle 
the same way. Or you'll be seeing what you want to see, not what the
vehicle really is, until you can't deny reality any more, at
which point you'll be bummed. Heavily bummed. Works the same
in relationships with people, cars, jobs, even yourself.

	Every vehicle I've bought, new or used, EVERY one, had some 'surprise'
to it that I didn't expect. So budget $500 for surprises, after
you get a mechanic you'll trust to tell you what's the actual
condition and budget for what you know needs work. The advantage
with a new car or a used car with warrantee, is that someone else
pays for the surprise.

	ESPECIALLY if you're after instant gratification, 
you're at grave risk of buying a surprise that costs money, or
time, or both, to fix. Keep that money in the bank for at least
a year. After that, well, there might be defects but they're on
your watch. For example, don't expect 75,000 to 100,000 MORE miles 
from the engine, or 50,000 miles from the tires. But be happy
if you get what you expect. Even 'perfect', a '76 Westie isn't a 
new car and won't behaive like one.

	Cheers!
	Bill
