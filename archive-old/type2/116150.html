Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

Thanks Snoopy,

Ah, that makes a lot of sense, thats a really good idea.  I guess I 
should have been more explicit about my bus situation ! Being a 1973 
Hightop Campmobile I too am without the handy shorepower 
charger/inverter, and I balked a little at the cost of a &quot;shore power&quot; 
circuit (700.00USD).

How long does it generally take to charge a battery with a standard 
charger ?

I'm pretty excited about my entertainment system, I've got all the 
components together and I've just got to get them all in the bus and 
running. It'll be running a 15&quot; Flatscreen, DVD player, Surround Sound, 
TV Tuner (Antenna) and of course Video games ... A little out of place 
in a 73 Bus maybe, but I've gotta keep my passengers happy, goodbye  
&quot;Are We There Yet&quot;.

Anyone else out there hiding any technology in their bus ?

Steve


&gt; Whenever I camp in a place with electric, I still run off my aux 
&gt; battery
&gt; with an invertor.. But I run an ext cord to a battery charger that is 
&gt; hooked
&gt; to my aux  :)  My bus doesn't have the plug in for shore power as 
&gt; Westy's do
&gt; and this works for me.
&gt;
&gt; Peace Brother,
&gt; Snoopy
