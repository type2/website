Subject: [T2] A New Bus Screensaver

Since it will be years before owners can send me
pictures of their own &quot;New Bus,&quot; I jumped ahead and
made a little saver from pictures currently floating
about.

If anyone has any serious issues about me using these
pictures, just email me and I'll pull the saver.

But remember, I left your website URL on the pictures
and I make NO money from this project, so it's free
advertising for you.

Just click the &quot;New Camper&quot; on my website:
