Subject: Thanks for the engine install assist

Thanks for the assistance to all. Installed the engine yesterday and
worked on fuel system today. Didn't drop the rear of the trans though it
might have gone faster if I had. Just removed the 3 pieces if tin from
the rear of the engine. Did not remove oil fill pipe. Took my time,
juggled 3 jacks and it slipped right in. Thanks for the confidence
builders.
Tom
