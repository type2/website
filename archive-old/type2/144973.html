&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I replaced recently the generator of our bay-window bus (1969) with an
&gt; alternator I got from the previous owner.
&gt; I now wonder about the correct hook-up of the wires. I have this thick red
&gt; wire connected to B+, the green wire connected to DF... is this OK? I
&gt; suppose the brown wire is ground, should I connect it to D-? And leave D+
&gt; alone?

Do be sure, even after following these instructions, as I am going by
memory.

At the alternator, connect the big wire to the big bolt, the little wire
to the little bolt.  At the voltage regulator connect the big wires
together and connect the little green wire to the little blue wire,
insulating both well.  The brown wire is ground so it just goes to the
case of the alternator.
