Subject: Re: Shelby Westfalias - was brown dash

Oh absolutely --- did not think it was the just the name...

If it was there would be a huge demand for early 80's 4 cylinder Chryslers 
bearing the same name.

Nope, haven't noticed a demand yet... (Don't see them very often around 
here anymore too...)

&gt;As someone who had the opportunity to drive (but not own) a few GT 350's
&gt;and a 289 Cobra, I assure you it was much more than just a &quot;Shelby&quot; name
&gt;tag. Rode, but not drove, a 427 Cobra...One of the few cars I've ever been
&gt;in where the tach and the speedo went up at almost the same speed!

Maybe a Shelby Westfalia?

Hmmm. Probably would spontaneously combust b/c as a concept they are so 
different. Internal conflict and stresses at an atomic level!
