&gt; &gt;&gt;You will also need a bug alternator or generator fan hub to properly
&gt; position the fan.  The bus hub won't work.
&gt;
&gt; do i need to worry about the hub if i replace with alt. kit?

Yes if your current generator is mounted using the 38A (bus generator)
tin.  If the thin at the forward end of the generator is slightly concave,
you need a new hub.  Ronnie at Old volks fixed me up with a brand new one.

The hub is the same for all bugs, alternator and generator.  The odd hub
is on the bus with the 38A generator, so it isn't included in the kits.

Speaking of kits, if you can get OEM tin and stand used, do so.  I'm not
pleased with the quality of the Taiwan tin and stand in the &quot;kit&quot;.  I
ended up scrounging the tin up at a wrecking yard in Reno (thanks, Chuck
Notmeyer for the tip) and it fit very well.
