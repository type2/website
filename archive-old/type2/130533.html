Subject: Swell gas can

I bought a Wedco 5 gal. jerry can a few months ago and used it on my trips. Worked like a charm: easy to fill, no fumes, no spills.

Since the CA govt. is protecting me from myself I had to purchase it from out of state because the CA version has been neutered and now we have a no spill can design with that stupid always spill plastic spout.

I recently saw the same can up north at Canadian Tire. It was sold under the Briggs &amp; Stratton brand and seemed a good deal at $40 CDN which included the spout which is usually sold separately. I highly recommend picking one up on your next trip takign advantage of the exchange rate.

Something I didn't know until recently: if you plan on taking it on a ferry, U.S Coast Guard regulations forbid the transport of fuel cans (full or empty) unless you are trailering a boat so keep it out of sight :-) or leave it at home.
