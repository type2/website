Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

&gt; My understanding is that Mobile 1 remains PAO
&gt; also.  Is that correct?  I cannot really tell
&gt; from any of the marketing hype on the websites,
&gt; except that Amsoil claims that Mobil 1 is similar
&gt; to stuff they used to make 30 years ago.  

I'd sure like to know, as I've been paying the big $$$
for Mobil 1 on the (perhaps incorrect!) belief that it
is real.  I knew that Castrol Syntec was fake synthetic
oil, but wasn't aware that Mobil might have followed
suit.

Anyone know for sure?
