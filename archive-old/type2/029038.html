Subject: Type 4 Heat Shield?
Message-ID: &lt;NNPCDOBJBLALBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Theres a piece of tinware that was nearly rusted through on the '77 engine I bought. It looks like a heat shield. It apparently goes between the muffler and the fan hub area...below the rear deck.

Is this piece available new that anyone knows of? I'm scouting locally but so far have come up dry.

Thanks! Joe
