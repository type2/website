Subject: heat booster fans, why does this work?

Someone help me understand this.

If the heat exchangers only get so hot then how does running more 
air by them make the inside hotter.  I would think that the more 
air you draw over the exchanger fins the cooler they would get 
and therefore the air coming into the cabin area would be cooler.

Is this right?

Also any Salt Lake listees interested in a BA6 heater, I think I
saw one at S &amp; M Auto on Redwood RD.  I glanced under the 81
Vanogon and didn't see anything tore up so I'll assume it's all 
there still.
