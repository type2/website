-I'm on the east coast in Maryland, Charlestown to be prescise
About the bus, It's in great bodily condition for being an east coast
bus( rust aorund front windshield, back window and rainrails and a few
spots here and there. The under side looks to have been under coated
whether that was factory done or not I don't know it is peeling  but no
rust. Of all the rust only one spot can you put your finger thru..and
that is passanger side step)
My uncle and I are gonig to do a compression test today after work and
he was talking about fixing the fuel problem for me(I waas told I
shouldn't mess with fuel prob. if Im not 15yrs exp.) So the fuel tank is
leaking from the back edges,so the engine isn't getting gas. It sat for
a year and some neighborhood kids threw some rocks, put cracks in the
wind sheild broke the tail lights,the passanger side window and got some
sort of paint dropplets on the original two tone job. I have put a
battery and a slave cyl. which is why it sat in the first place. If it's
too much of a hassle I'll probably give it to my uncle to play with.
He's got his vw running great so maybe he needs another proj.  Let me
know whatt you think this is so depressing for me. You know though,... -
