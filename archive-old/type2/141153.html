Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [Bulk] [T2] need a starter in Las Vegas

Most starters have 2 spade connectors on the starter one right next to the
other , you could just hook a wire up to the one not being used and run wire
that near  your batt and just touch the wire to the POS lead on the BATT and
see it your starter turns over.

&gt; In that case, I should be able to take two wires and bypass the ignition
switch.
&gt; I have a push button switch and big gauge wire that I can use. How should
I
&gt; install that button (what wires sould be in contact) in order to get the
&gt; starter running will my key is at the start position? I suspect that I
should
&gt; match the red with the Red and black, I this right? I have already done
that in
&gt; my previous golf and it worked for many years...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
