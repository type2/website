Volks,
  My manual said install left heat exchanger then install engine bearer , 
well i did now i cant get the bearer on the stud, is there some trick I look 
at this and wonder why you have to install the exchanger first it makes no 
sense , but i cant get the rubber mount stud bolt thru the hole in the 
bearer. Am i misssing something?

  David
