Subject: Re: [T2] anti-seize + dead plug


&gt;On another topic.  How many of you, and how many times have y'all had a
&gt;spark plug actually FAIL?  Not &quot;I changed the plugs, etc., etc. and she
&gt;came to life&quot; but verifiable &quot;dead plug&quot;.
----------------------------------

Several times over the years, on a variety of 2 &amp; 4-cycle gas engines including O/B motors and military vehicles.

In the A/C VW realm I've had brand new Bosch plugs be dead right out of the box; twice on the same vehicle in the same year.

The most dramatic failure was a new Bosch plug that blew it's innards right out of the ceramic shell _at_ ~4,000 RPM on I-5.  That plug was made in India.
