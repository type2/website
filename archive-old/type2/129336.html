Dylan, you screw the screw in until it gently bottoms out. Don't force it or
you can damage the seat. Just until it is screwed in and fully closed. Then
turn the screws out about 1-1/2 full turns to start. Here is an excellent
page to give you all the directions you need. I hope this helps. Dell's are
the best carbs I have ever used.

Subject: [T2] dual dellorto tuning

I have installed my rebuilt dellorto 36mms on our 2.0l bus engine. My
question being how to set the air fuel mixture right. It smells like it is
running
rich. I have a carb syncro tool and will sync the carbs but what about the
air
fuel mix. Is in or out less fuel or any other ideas to start with. Thanks
Dylan.  I would prefer not to get into jetting yet until I have an
understanding of
the basics.
PS we are running a one step up on the cam, solid lifters and 050 dizzy with
electronic points, flame thrower coil. Seems to have good power already.
