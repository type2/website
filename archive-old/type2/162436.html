&gt; #5. AC unit.  The under-dash units don't thrill me.  They seem to only
&gt; work well for the driver/passenger, and they're expensive as heck.  I'm
&gt; currently searching for a unit from an RV (in the 8-12K BTU range) to
&gt; strip down and mount in the passenger side of the engine compartment.
&gt; Run the condenser coil underneath the bus, run the evaporator coil to


&gt; the front, add a blower/controls/etc.   Probably have to step up to a
&gt; 95A alternator to pull it all, and add an idle kick-up selenoid.

let us know where you find a 95A unit that will fit and show us how you
got it in there

&gt; Thoughts? Comments?  Snide remarks?

you need the amps but how???
