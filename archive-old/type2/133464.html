&gt; The bolt that holds the pulley attached to the crankshaft came out.  I

&gt; After attaching the bolt and pulley, I attempted to make it home.  It ran
&gt; horrible.  This is a 78 2.0L, FI.
&gt; Questions.. would I have done any serious damage without the fan belt and
&gt; pulley turning for 4 miles?

I lost the same bolt on mine, I have guages and it was the dead of winter
and about 5F degrees when it happened, the engine shot up from 190 to 250
in less than a mile, which is about what it took to get to a safe spot to
stop.  I heard the bolt come off so I know exactly where it happened,

fixed the bolt, waited about a half hour for the engine to cool a bit
(maybe the most nerve wracking half hour in recent memory) but engine
started right up and has run fine since...

mine is also a 78FI with auto tranny
