Subject: Bumper Sticker

I saw Merl Saunders and the Rainforest Band last night and aquired an
bumper sticker fo my bus
It says &quot;Save the Planet
             So we'll have a place to boogie!&quot;
If Merle is coming to your town check him out. He's one awesome dude
(very approachable) and he and the band did an interesting version of
&quot;Dark Star&quot;
