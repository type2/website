&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;  I purchased an after market bugpac or bugpack oil cooler with quite a few 
&gt;connectors and a 11&quot; square nice coil that will mount under the bus. Has 
&gt;anyone evr had experience with mounting and hooking up. Being there are no 
&gt;directions...
&gt;

No experience with mounting and hooking up, just with dismounting and
unhooking
when replacing the motor that destroyed its self as it screamed, &quot;I don't like
this oil starvation any more!!!!!!&quot;
