Subject: vw found/ 65 carb woes

Really, today was not going to be a VW day.   I needed to do something else,
like make a futon frame.   But a friend called up, and said he was coming
thought town today on the way to the beach.... so he stopped by in his nice
67 velvet green/pearl white non sunroof deluxe.  We were talking about paint,
the best to use, and the best way to take the  UGLY  housepaint of the dash
of my 65 camper, without using something that'll give me a headache.   And
figuring out a good white to paint the rims and bumpers so I can put the rear
bumper on it and the bumper sticker Jan gave me, and I know you can stick
stickers right on the bus but I don't want to.  I have a plan, you see . BTW,
anyone ever find a list of what colours VW used for wheels and bumpers?   

So this guy drives up in an Chevy Malibu.   Said he'd been in Hawaii for 15
years, and got back a bit ago, and has this old bug, you know, with the
little back window.   Very surprised to find out I do VWs.     Funny when
people keep saying that.  But I'd rather they do say they are surprised, than
be all snotty.  Seems more honest and straightforward.  

So we went down the street to look at the bug, it was very nice, a 55, been
painted  silver and needed the interior and windows etc put back in.   The
motor was torn down to a short block in the garage, and I told him what I
thought, that it had half an inch of end play, but the H case had been case
savered and was prolly good.  Anyway, I'm not really into bugs, but I thought
I'd share that with you.  You never know what is buried in your neighbors'
garages.

65 Camper Update 

The camper is temporarily garaged, as it was a royal PITA the other day,
 being very hard to start, and eventually draining the battery to the point
where I needed a jump, and it took 20 minutes (i am not kidding) to get it
going and I was almost late for work.   Well, serves me right, as I knew the
carb was not happy, and needed attention.   That is  Tomorrows Project, to
examine the inside of the carb (prolly a rust clog) again, and do a 100 miile
tune up and oil change.  Yes, 100 miles, that motor sat for years and the oil
was gross.    Did I mention that it was only getting about 11mpg?   What is
up with that?  I bet it'll be happier when I get that ugly brown paint off
the dash.
