Jaime and list,

        Kadrons.......dual carbs...........more hp........

        Are we talking about a dragster......an off-road burner.....an
unreliable gas guzzler....or are you talking about a Type 2?  I will
humbley admit that I am not a 10 year plus veteran of v-dubs as many of our
now cringing fellow listees, but I can say I know where to draw the line
between reliable, efficient, and loyal versus unreliable, inefficient, and
tempermental. 

         I daily drive a stock type 2...a '69 model.  On the weekends, my
stock type 2 trailers my semi-radical, V-dub powered, Kadron- antlered Sand
Rail a distance of 100+miles at speeds in excess of 65 mph, under 200 
degrees (well, 230 in Summer) , at near 20 mpg (25+ empty).  My bus is my
quaint, mobile, home away from home and my buggy is my wild, raging, bull. 
I see both ends of the V-dub spectrum.  I have seen 1915cc buggies
over-carbureted to the hilt that you could stall with the mere force of
your arms holding them back  and I have seen stock engined/carbed dune
buggies pull wheelies out of sight.    Simply stated, sometimes more is
often less and I can think of no better example than the tough little Vw.

        More to the point......you could invest your money better by
rebuilding your engine stock and see EQUAL IF NOT BETTER hp gains,
guarantee better gas mileage and longitivity, as well as improved cooling,
and the best part is, you dont have to give up the reliability and
simplicity that you have.  You'd be surprise at the difference a good
running air-pumper is compared to a worn out one.  I used to think top
speed in an early bread loaf was 65.  Now, I know an engine  in &quot;just&quot; good
condition will move my little bay in excess of 80!
        Here is another point.  Kadrons sell new for $400 (done that). 
They sell used at a V-dub swap meet for $30 bucks maybe (done that - Ask
Ken).  This crowd has 100 times the experience with Volkswagens than the
average Sand Nut.   They sell used at an off-road V-dub swap for $150
dollars (done that, too).  The next level up in aftermarket carbs are
Webers and Dellortos and you talking $700+ bucks for new pair if you can
find them in stock.  Now....if you must go aftermarket, go with a single
carb...like a Weber.

         My experience with brand new Kadrons has been awful.  They leaked
around the bowls from day one...think you are going to see me take em apart
and replace the gaskets as the should have come from BROSIL...uhhh uhhh. 
The linkage can simply be thrown away out to the box. And boy, do they EVER
have a dead spot.   At the dunes, I see the tinkerers,  I see the cussers, 
I see the farters and poppers, and  then I see the old-timers smiling away
proudly  with their smooth-running single carbureted beasts.

whew.......
take care all...
and Jaime....we KNOW you will make the right decision! ;-)

____________YOU WROTE:____________      
If I install my dual Kadrons and a large flange exhaust on my existing
1600sp, can I expect to have any usable gain? I'm only interested in
pulling hills at a better pace and running 65mph whenever possible.
I've been told the above would equal a 20% Hp gain over the original
(5 Hp each=10 Hp/over the stock 50 Hp) T/F??

Would the above cause any excessive wear on my old 1600? I don't know
the date of the last rebuild or the mileage at that time, but the
compression is good.

Will this cause any change in running temps? Gas mileage?

Anyone out there running this set-up? Any other suggestions?
