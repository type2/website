I'm right in Baltimore and will give you a hand as needed, will be at work
all day Fri.  know a few places in the area that do good work, and a few
to avoid. if you want I will send my work phone # to anyone going (need an
excuse to knock off early and see another van)  I am less than 2mi from
I-95   (BTW when going through Baltimore a better faster route down 95 is
to go through the old tunnel I-895 and then exit  to Md 3, US 301, I-97
south [all the same exit]  follow I-97 to Md 3 to US 301 [same road]
taking the bypass route around DC which is a mess right now at the Woodrow
Wilson Bridge, instead go over the Harry W Nice bridge and rejoin I-95
just North of Richmond.

at a Minimum at least an hour faster, probably more and it is an easy
relaxing drive.

Wish I were going with you
