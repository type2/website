Subject: Re: [T2] non bus( Beetle hub)

Piece o' cake.  Go to your local truck tire repair emporium and have  
them hit it with their 1&quot; impact. It'll come right off. Snug it back  
up, put a cotter pin in it and drive it home. Remove cotter pin,  
remove nut. Struggle to remove the drum. Put nut back on but leave it  
one turn loose. Put cotter pin back in. Drive car around the block.  
Left turns if left drum, right if right. Return home, jack it up,  
remove cotter pin &amp; nut &amp; now loose drum. Do the brake thing. Put a  
dab of anti-seize on the splines. Put it all back together. Tighten  
nut to the required 216 (or is it 235, don't remember) lbs/ft of  
torque. Tight, isn't it?
