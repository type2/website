  Hi Listees.
   Having finnished my engine install after repainting the engine bay, plus
numerous other things including installing a new mechanical fuel pump, I
tried starting her but the engine isn't firing. I have spark and the timing
is OK. I'm thinking I maybe installed the fuel inlet and outlet lines to the
pump, backwards.Could someone let me know which goes where?
Thanks.
This is on my 73 Westy 1700cc dual solex engine.
