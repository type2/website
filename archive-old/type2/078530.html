Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [[T2] any tricks to remove fan hub?]

Clark, Eddie:
Maybe this is a little late. Clark is darn near right on the factory (Bentley)
method of removing the hub. The factory tool is a big &quot;C&quot; shaped washer that fits
between the hub and the seal and transmits the pressure around the nose of the
case equally.
I don't have one of these tools, just use 3 big flat washers and bear down equally
till it pops off. I usually put the center bolt back on loosely to catch it. It
really comes off with a bang. I'd definitely use all three bolts.

&gt; Get some flat stock steel - preferrably 1/8&quot; or better, 2-3 inches long and at
&gt; least an inch wide - and place it between the hub and the case so that it will
&gt; support the bolts you're going to torque down against it.
