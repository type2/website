&gt; well, thank the lord, i was starting to get worried their when i went and

actually if you have a good core the torque converter is readily
rebuildable, I had one rebuilt just 6 months ago and they said parts are
not a problem, only getting decent cores to rebuild..so if you have the
core they will rebuild in 3-4 day about $125  (I had mine done at DelMarVa
convertor source, they've done a couple for me and all have worked fine)

&gt; i figured the seal needed

I have posted this before but it is one of the places that the Bentley is
remiss and doesn't mention.  the torque convertor seal is NOT SEATED in
the opening, rather it is &quot;faced&quot; that is the front of the seal is flush
with the top of the recess it is placed in.  also be sure and check the
new seal (I get mine from Bus Depot he has had them even though they
weren't always listed in the catalog) I have gotten bad seals right out of
the package...the rubber is VERY thin and  tears easily

good luck
