I am currently in the process of restoring a 75' westy. My problem is a bad hinge on my poptop (drivers's side). It's got a bad bend in it, preventing the top from closing properly (the drivers side sits up a bit when closed)  Is there a place that sells these hinges or should i go hunting in boneyards for a better hinge?

  The poptop itself is in bad shape. The previous owner told me the bus had lived much of its life in Arizona.  The finish has been warn away exposing the fibers.  A friend of mine who works on boats for a living told me i can reseal it with a good coat of fiberglass resin.  I am just curious if anyone else has ever had this problem and what did you do to fix it.

Thanks
