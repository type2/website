I missed the thread on this as my last digest was short and left off most of 
the posts?? Oh well.

I am a veterinarian in a small town in east Tennessee. Sad to say my work 
horse 68 DC went belly up many years ago with a locked up engine. That baby 
went everywhere to work on cows in the field, would go anywhere the 4x4 
would. Many new calves were delivered with the mom tied to the gates.

Anyway the engine was locked near the front gate to the farm and someone 
offered me $ and I took it. Has been passed around over the years but listee 
Marv Krupps has it now. 

Hey Marv, did you get the empi wheels and repair pannels I gave with it? I 
bet not. :-)

Now VWs are a hobby. Try to keep at least one on the road to enjoy for 
camping.

Pray for peace,
