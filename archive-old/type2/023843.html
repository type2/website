Subject: My broken sunroof?
Message-ID: &lt;68e54f45.2456b265_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

O.K.,  its gettin warm out, and i really want to be able to open the sunroof 
in my 79 Bus. When i got it in the fall, the roof dropped a little bit when i 
turned the crank, but wouldnt open up or seal shut. After a few good rains i 
was convinced it was worth it to caulk up for the winter.  
   I havent messed with it yet, but i really would like to get full use out 
of it this summer. I have been wondering how the inner workings are set up, 
and where to get them and for about how much they would be. i tried checkin 
it all out without breakin the seal, but cant figure it out. If anybody has 
had experiance with these things, please help me formulate some ideas in this 
little head o' mine.
