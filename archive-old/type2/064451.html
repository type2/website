Subject: Re: clutch, 78 

    
    On my 78 bus, 1st gear engages easier if the bus is rolling forward at
    1-2 mph.  Sometimes I can barely force it into 1st if the bus is
    stopped, but let my foot off the brake and let it roll a little (I
    always try to park facing downhill), and it'll slide right in like
    silk.  The other gears, especially 2 and R, are a little notchy but
    not bad.  Can anyone explain this?

Well, on my '78, I have simply always shifted into first
by shifting first into second and then, without lifting 
the clutch pedal, shifting into first.  Bought the thing
from a VW mechanic and he said it was common to have to
do this and harmless.  Never thought about it again.  Like
most things (that I've never thought of again) I have no
better explanation, etc.
