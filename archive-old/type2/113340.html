&gt;I have also used Bus Boys. Which one time in the past I had a problem

We love Bus Boys here on the west coast. I dropped by the shop a couple of weeks back and I asked Walter if the Euro was going to drive up some of the prices. He said no and insisted that I take a new catalog because there was a new owner and many of the prices had dropped. I'm not sure which items he was referring to because I've always shopped around and found their prices good. Maybe $6 for the sump plate o-ring is a little too much.
