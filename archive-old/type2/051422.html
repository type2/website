Subject: [T2] Eberspaecher BN2 glow plug (195GLS) group purchase

I recently burned out the glow plug on my BN2 gas heater by applying 12V
directly to it (don't do this with a BN2 as it is a 4V plug!).  After
researching options for a new plug here in the USA and finding only one
source (Ark the heater guy, $68+) I decided to talk directly to Beru AG.
Thanks to their efforts and a little help from my parents who are living in
Germany, I was able to get a brand new Beru 195GLS glow plug for about $30.
Here are pics:

The new plug looks slightly different, but has the same part number on it
and works great.  Glows bright red.  :-)  It does say &quot;Made in Ireland&quot; on
the plug despite what the box says.

This worked out so well that I wanted to pass on the opportunity to the
list.  My parents have agreed to buy a few more plugs for listmembers, so
if anyone is interested in a NEW Beru (OEM Brand) glow plug for their
Eberspaecher BN2 gas heater for $30, let me know.  If the response is not
more than I can handle, I will collect the money, send it to my parents,
order the plugs, and distribute them when they arrive.  This whole process
will likely take about a month.  The shipping cost is included in the $30.

Here's all I ask:

Limit of two plugs per person.
NO dealers
You agree not to resell these plugs on E-B-A-Y or similar site - my parents
and I are not profiting from this and neither should you.
Optional:  Send my parents a thank-you note or buy them a beer.  They are
good people.  :-)

Last but not least, I am open to including other Beru plugs as well.  If
you send me the part number, I will see what I can do.
