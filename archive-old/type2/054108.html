Subject: Re: front beam interchangibility

&gt; Front beams-- Does any one know which years will fit into a 77?
&gt; I can get one from a 79 or a 73 and was wondering if it mattered?

Hi Snoopy,

I think it doesn't matter which one you chose. If I am right then both
should be exactly the same. One thing: check if your 77-bus has a
brake-servo. It is a large disc-shaped object attached to the
brake-cylinder attached to the front beam. When you buy another
front-beam it is possible that it came from a bus that wasn't equiped
with this option. In that case you'll have to weld new mountings on the
beam to hold the brake-servo.

If you are looking for older beams then you must take notice of the
distance between the bolts that hold the beam to the chassis. I believe
that on pre-1970 busses it was 9cm, after that it was 12cm (not 100%
sure about the dates).
