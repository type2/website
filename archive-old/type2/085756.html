Subject: bus stereos / how much power??

Hello,

so I have been trying, and trying, and trying to come up with a stereo 
configuration that doesn't sound like shite and have not had much luck.

Currently, I run 4.5 full range speakers in the lower part of the front 
doors, which basically sound like crap since they are down by your feet, and 
the passenger likes to rest their leg against it, muffling what sound you do 
have.

I also have one ten inch sub in the back, in a box, running off of this 2 
channel amp.

Any suggestions on a decent stereo setup?

Maybe separates up front, mounting the tweeters someplace much higher, and 
the door/mids someplace higher as well? Not sure how far up the door you can 
go, with the window getting in the way, but maybe that would help?

Also, you know how Vanagon's have those speakers up in the upper rear area? 
Any thoughts on the size of speakers one could rig up in that area? Im 
guessing I would just need some kind of jigsaw to mangle my upper cargo 
area. I was thinking about just removing it since I never use the overhead 
thing, and would rather have the headroom, but if it can hold some speakers 
maybe ill keep it.

Anyone have a particular stereo setup they are happy with? you can hear it 
over the road noise, without having to turn it up all the way?

Now on to the mail part of all this - can I run an amp, at all? I have a 
second battery setup, but if I drive with the stereo on for about 5 hours, 
it goes dead. I would need to drive with the stereo on for one day, leave it 
off all the next, maybe use it the following day, etc.

Higher output alternator? (do they make those for busses)
no amp?
much lower output amp?
deal with it, its a bus?

thoughts, feelings, and general tomfoolery welcomed.
