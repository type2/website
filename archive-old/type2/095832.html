Subject: RE: [T2] Bus won't move (still)

I think you may need to take the nose cone off completely (which means
engine and transmission out).
When my previous bus became stuck in third gear the before inspection
diagnosis was that the bracket which holds the selector in place was broken;
but in fact all that had happened was that the inner end of the shift rod
which is J shaped had come out of the rubber bushing in the eye at the top
of the selector, a new bushing was all that was required.

Good luck

OK, the story so far... '72 Westy with 1700 engine, stock tranny. The bus is
stuck in place and will not move. No matter what I do, the transmission will
not go into gear, nor will it roll in neutral or with the clutch engaged.
The
clutch action feels normal, and I have adjusted the clutch cable both ways
to
make sure that wasn't it. Other things that I have looked at are: front
shift
plate, front shifter coupling, rear shifter coupling, and I even pulled the
nosecone off (as far is it comes off) and checked the shift lever and made
sure that the pin holding it in the bracket was not slipping. Just to make
sure, I knurled the end of the pin and press fitted it back in. I may go
ahead and open the nosecone again, just to make sure that I got the shift
lever in the right place, but it was doing this before I checked it. Any
further suggestions?
