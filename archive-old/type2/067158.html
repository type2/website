&gt; &gt;When driving at Highway speeds, the van has started steering herself, feels

&gt; Oh yes, a wave to the right, a wave to the left.  I am there with you on
&gt; that one.  Last January when I first brought Hildegarde up from Florida to
&gt; Wisconsin I got pulled over two times in one evening for drunk driving!

Doesn't help that one of their clues that someone is drunk is that
they're driving 5-10 MPH below the speed limit! :)

Just a thought - my Sway-A-Way sway bars made a noticeable difference in
the amount of sway in my Westy at highway speeds. They were well worth
the $200 or so. If you don't have them, give it a thought or two. The
side-to-side can be sort of amusing, but it can also be dangerous!
