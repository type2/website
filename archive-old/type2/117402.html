&gt; hey folks, i might be picking up a 73 adventurewagen with a blown engine,
&gt; still there but seized up.  i have a 72 4 speed westy hi roof conversion
&gt; currently but if i can get this bus i was planning on taking my engine and
&gt; putting it in the 73 and parting out my 72 as the 73 is in much better
&gt; condition and has the full adventurwagen package which is too cool to pass
&gt; up.  my main question is do i need to swap anything out in order to put my
&gt; 72 engine in the 73 being that the trannies are different or is it just a
&gt; simple swap and run???

well you will need to swap the flywheel for the flexplate, and have to
reset the endplay on the engine...not very hard.

you will also need to swap out the vacuum line and tap into the carb
system to control the shifter...

the accelerator linkage is different so that will need to be adjusted. and
possibly swapped

hmmmm can't think of anything else off the top of my head, you will have
to use a number of parts from the 73 on your engine but since you have it
that shouldn't be a problem
