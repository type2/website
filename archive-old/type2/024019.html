Subject: Found: Westy interior
Message-ID: &lt;7076e938.24ba9b18_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello Listees,

I just had to share what I think is a terrific find (at least for me).  I 
have been considering interior options for my '72 non-westy camper, Hannah.  
Someday I'll post pictures of her on my web site, but for now suffice it to 
say that she is unique.  I have not seen another bus quite like her.  She has 
a pop-top, but it goes straight up like a Sportsmobile.  Unlike a 
Sportsmobile, her top support braces are on the inside and are at the front 
and rear, not on the sides.  It is too well done to be a &quot;one off&quot; design.  
There are stickers on the top that say &quot;Hanover Mfg. Co.  North Surrey, BC.&quot;  
This is/was a Canadian bus.

Anyway, when I found her in NE Oklahoma, she was in fairly sad shape.  No 
engine, some early bay Westy interior pieces sitting loosely inside her and 
mildew growing all over her.  I snagged her for $300 and towed her home where 
she has been sitting for a year and a half.  My original plans were to put a 
full width Westy seat/bed in her, the fold up table and the rear facing jump 
seat behind the driver.  Nothing fancy, but certainly useable for simple 
camping trips without destroying her utility as a hauling vehicle.

Well, I have many things to do to her to get her ready for BBA.  I had 
earlier sent out an inquiry to the List about a rear seat/bed, since I don't 
think I will have time to make one using the set of hinges that I have.  On 
the way home from work last week I drove by a salvage yard and as is my 
habit, looked to see if there were any VWs there (this is not my normal 
route, but they are installing new traffic lights and so I took an alternate 
route home, funny how things work out).  To my surprise I noticed a later 
model loaf camper.  The wheels in my brain started turning and I thought 
&quot;maybe there is an interior there that I could use&quot;.  Saturday morning my 
ladyfriend and I went out to take a look.  The yard was open and the owner 
said to go look.  The bus is a '75 Westy with a complete interior, including 
sink, stove/refrigerator unit, rear seat/bed AND the little stool.  The only 
thing missing that we could tell was the front cot (we got the brackets 
though) and the table top.  I was STOKED!  I made a deal for the interior 
pieces and we spent the rest of the day pulling it out.  The fabic is the 
blue and green plaid stuff which I like better than the orange and green 
plaid.  It is in pretty good shape, but some things will need to be repaired 
or replaced.

This bus must have had a hoard of squirrrels or (worse, rats) living in it 
for some time.  There was animal waste everywhere.  Karen and I wore dust 
masks to prevent inhaling the stuff.  Our plans are to try and clean it up 
and keep it as original as possible.  Does anyone have any good ideas for 
cleaning and sanitizing?  We thought we could carefully take the fabric off 
and hand wash it and the foan could be washed and bleached and allowed to 
dry.  Any thoughts or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I 
will not have time to install the complete interior, just the rear seat/bed 
in time for BBA.

As I mentioned earlier, I didn't really want all the Westy interior, but 
seeing how neat all the stuff is, I'm planning to use it all and have a 
complete camper bus.  I can't figure out where they kept the spare tire on 
the '75.  There was no front tire mount and it looks like the tire would not 
fit in the rear closet.  Anyone with a '75 Westy care to comment?

I just had to share this as I am really excited that I could find such a neat 
deal right in my own town.  VWs are fairly scarce here, let alone Westys.

By the way, the '75 doner bus was a total rust bucket.  I think it was from 
New York.  Definitely not a candidate for restoration.

Take care all,

Rob Dahlgren
