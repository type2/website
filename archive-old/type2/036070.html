Subject: Seattle trip- Parts stores?

Hi All,

I'll be travelling to Seattle, Wash. at the end of of Feb and need to score
a Pertronix ignition set and an engine seal for my 72' Bus. (1700 engine)
And maybe some other goodies as well.  Parts are a lot cheaper over there
than thay are here in Sweden.....
Anyway, can any local listees please help me out with a couple of good local
stores? Please p-mail so we don't waste list space. 

TIA,

John B.
'72 Camper
'65 Beetle (2 ea.)

P.S. I'm not sure what area of Seattle I'll be in but somewhere around Linds
Avenue S.W.  (FAA offices) if you know where that is.
