I want to fit an oil temp gauge and it screws into the drain plug hole.
Unfortunately ever since I've had the bus I've never been able to budge it.
No problem for oil changes as there's two other plates you can take off.

The plug has a hex hole for an Allen key, but I've just ended up twisting 2
of them useless by adding extra leverage from a tube. I also used the hex
bit from my impact driver in my socket set, and that's also ruined. I didn't
dare try the driver as I don't want to crack the case, and I wouldn't expect
heat to be much help, given that the oil is boiling hot.

Any other ideas? The hexagonal hole in the plug seems intact.
