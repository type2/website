Subject: RE: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

&gt; In all, I probably spent about $3500. I did a full teardown and rebuild of
&gt; the Corvair engine. If one found a engine and tranny on good

&gt; &quot;Considering that the flat-six was used in the 911, you are dead-on there.
&gt; A much more spendy option, in fact, is to put the Porsche flat-six in the
&gt; bus. Of course, a solid 911 engine will set you back $3K-$5K minimum.&quot;

The $3K-$5k is the range for just a non-rebuilt engine. 911 engines are
quite expensive. That doesn't include rebuild costs (if so inclined),
transmission, and installation! I'd bet a 911 conversion would run close to
$10K complete.
