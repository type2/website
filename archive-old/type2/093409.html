Subject: Gauges - final

On advice of list member Michael LaBarge,
I went to:
http://www.bugsandbuggies_dot_com/vdo_main.asp
and wound up speaking with a fellow named Don; very helpful.

I am getting a pod case for three 2.0625&quot; meters to mount side by side of 
Oil pressure, Oil Temp, Cyl Head Temp.
This pod will be mounted under the dash and upside down, with the meters 
slightly angled towards me for easy reading while driving. The pod will be 
just to my right as I sit in the driver's seat.

Gauges will be VDO Cockpit, black series style.

I will also mount a 3.125&quot; Tachometer (0-7000 RPM) in the clock cavity.
This gauge will be VDO Vision style.

Oil Pressure sensor will be a dual type for gauge and idiot light, mounting 
where standard pressure switch currently mounts.

Oil Temp sender will mount in the sump plate, beside the drain plug, but so 
as to not interfere with the pump pickup tube.

Cyl Head Temp sender will measure off of the #3 cylinder, being secured by 
the spark plug (?)

That's the plan.
Will firm the order tomorrow, unless somebody points out to me that I have 
done something really wrong here.

Soon to be knowingly transducered and monitored,
and slightly lessened in $$$.
