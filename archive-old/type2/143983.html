Subject: CHT gauge- was Tach-&gt; Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

I'm curious, why do most listees rag so badly on the
VDO gauges? Seems like the CHT is beaten up more than
the rest, but oil temp and even oil pressure get
knocked around. I understand they're not perfect, but,
for cryin' out loud, they're better than a single
pressure idiot light, wouldn't you think? I would
dearly love to hear specific beefs and any work
arounds (since I just installed all 3 aforementioned
gauges in my bus). Thanks, volks!

&gt; work(as well as they ever work!).
