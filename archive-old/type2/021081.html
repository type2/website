Quoth Alan , post CV job:
&gt; Now, I am sitting in a snow bank, picking the CV grease from
&gt; under my finger nails.
 
Trust me, if you saw my solvent damaged fingertips (VW work since 1972,
electron microscope/histology lab work)-easily cracking thickend,
nonelastic skin at the high stress zones- at my age (56) you'd use the
nitrile gloves I use now for the dirty work!  Out of all the gloves I've
tried for the less fine work, I like either goatskin gloves or the
gardener green cloth gloves coated with a rough latex,  bought in Home
Depot.  I hate seams in any gloves which is why the latter are the
best.  In colder weather, glue-seamed wetsuit material gloves found in
the Hunting section are good, they have 3 fingertips that pull back for
needed fine work. MB 78 Westy
