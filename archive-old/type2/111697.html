&gt; 2 questions.  I am getting terrible gas mileage on a 78 FI with automatic
&gt; transmission.  I am getting 14-17 mpg.  I have checked and adjusted the timing
&gt; and dwell, install new distributor cap and points.  What else could be a
&gt; culprit?  Usually travel 65 mph or less.

what did you set your timing &amp; dwell to?

&gt; Second question, the check oil light has been on quite a bit.  I have just
&gt; changed oil and filter and strainer.  This am, it was blazing red for quite a
&gt; while, and then fluttered the remainder of the 100 mile trip.

Did you change oil weight at the change? or has it always done this?
moving to a lower oil weight might cause the pressure to drop
(especially on an older worn engine)
