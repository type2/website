Subject: Cleaning westy pop top, a chem free way

Hey all,
I by pure accident found a way to get my dingy grey/brown mottled with
mold pop top bright white without chemicals and little effort!  On my
trip back from MN to Atlanta, I stopped at one of those self service car
washes. The reason was to spray the mass of dead bugs off the front of
the bus before we got back into the high heat of the south.  After
getting the bugs off and washing down the sides I aimed the spray wand
at the pop top. And much to my surprise it created a nice white strip
where I had sprayed.  I waited until I got back to Atlanta to finish it
up.  Last evening I finished it and I now have a nice white pop top
again.  It cost me about $7 dollars in quarters. It is a somewhat slow
proccess, and it seems to help to go very slowly and move along in a
straight line from end to end. Hope this is helpful to others who would
rather avoid putting nasty chemicals on their bus and into the
enviroment. BTW, I tried using both the &quot;wash&quot; and &quot;rinse&quot; modes, where
the wash adds soap to the spray, I saw no difference. The cleaning
effect it seems is simply high pressure.
