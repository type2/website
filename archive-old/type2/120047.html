Subject: Help! Need body panel + hatch

Volks,

It seems BustedBus can't help - and I need a body panel to *finish* the body work on my '78 Bus before painting.

Specifics: a &quot;quarter panel&quot;, rear, passenger side, including the gas filler orifice, trapezodial in shape.  There aren't any wreck Buses to my knowledge in the Augusta, GA area - so if anyone has one rusting away in the back yard, or has a lead on someone who does, *please* contact me.

Santa!  Where are you? :)

Incidentally, I also need a straight engine hatch.  My NOS hatch which I purchased last year was stolen :(

Happy Holidays and wishes for a Happy New Year for all of Busdom,

Justin Smith
