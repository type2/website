Re: Pre-purchase questions about a '72 Camper (Seats, A/C, ...)
 
I'm considering a '72 camper and would appreciate help with a few
specific questions and any other sage advice.  The bus is out of town, so
I'll probably not see it until I'm ready to hand over the check (assuming
reality matches the verbal description).
 
The upholstery appears to be the main problem.  Was this a two bucket/bench
configuration?  Any estimates on cost and suggested sources for replacements?
 
I'm in Texas, where A/C is a major consideration for at least 3 months of the
year.  Can A/C be fitted to this model?  If so, are they easily found? Again,
ideas on cost and sources?
 
Are there any other features or quirks about this model that I should
consider?
 
I'm signed up on the digest, so would appreciate being copied directly on any
replies.
 
Thanks and regards,  Bob Douglas
