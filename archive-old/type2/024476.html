Subject: CHT sender placement follow-up
To: type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

First a brief synopsis:
My old CHT sender broke so while I had the engine out, (and had the heater 
boxes welded up) I had the mechanic weld a stud onto the side of the exhaust 
manifold near where it connects to the #3 exhaust port.  I formerly had it 
under the top left cylinder head stud, where I had maximum readings of 350.

When I first tried it out on a long(ish) trip to Black Mountain, NC, I was 
getting readings of 350 (min) and nearly 450 (max).  Ambient temperature was 
about 70.  That took a little getting used to, but I got comfortable with the 
minimum reading.

As an aside, the gauge is marked in 50 degree increments, so these readings 
are not exact, just an indication of which mark the needle was closest to.

Not long afterward, the extractor manifold developed a leak in the #4 pipe, 
so I pulled the exhaust system off (anyone need a good Thunderbird muffler?) 
and replaced it with a beetle exhaust (hoping for more cabin heat).  The 
minimum temperature climbed to 400 and the maximum to 500 (same ambient 
temp.).  This was getting scary.  Apparently, the extractor system was 
helping to draw heat away.

Now with the cooler weather (and the use of the heat) I'm getting different 
readings altogether.  With the heat on, the temperature climbs another 50 
degrees to about 450.  Since the heater works on a countercurrent system 
(cool [ambient] air runs in the opposite direction of hot [exhaust] air), 
things are HEATED UP at the upstream (exhaust pipe) end of the heat 
exchangers.

I changed the location of the sender as a matter of accessibility, hoping for 
similar readings.  Someone else on the list wedged the sender between some 
fins (on the underside of the head near the combustion chamber -- I still 
have a hard time picturing this -- perhaps this person, if he reads this, 
could post to me a more detailed description of this placement).

Well, thanks for the bandwidth, hope this helps, FYI, AFAIK, FWIW, IMHO, 
WALSTIB.
