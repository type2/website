I've been a mostly silent member since near the beginning of this list, I
usually just email direct to someone that posts a question I have input on.
I take the &quot;does everybody on the list need to see this&quot; seriously.

People we drive vintage bus's! Parts are hard to find! I don't know Ron
personally but over the years I've done business with him dozens of time
always happy that I could get parts for a 24 year old bus.

To Ron:  Just remember most of the list are like me, silent, using the list
as a resource not a chat line, and the kind of bus people that are a
different breed. We truly appreciate all of the vendors that work to provide
us with parts to keep the bus habit going. Keep up the good work and don't
let a few people with minor complaints reflect on all of us! The silent
majority is with you.
