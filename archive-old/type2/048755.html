Dear Graig.

Further to my message acknowledging your question, my most recent 
information for the Quaife limited-slip differential, given in the April 
1999 issue of VW Motoring, on page 53, is that it was then available from 
Autocavan, for the VW Types 1 &amp; 2, with independent rear suspension (I 
interpret this as referring to 1968 onward VW Type 2s) and VW Type 1 with 
swing axle suspension.

Details for Autocavan, are as follows :-

Geoff Thomas (proprietor)
Autocavan Components H.Q.
13 Tessa Road

England

I hope this is of help! Please let me know later what progress you make in 
your enquiries.

Regards.
               Nigel A. Skeet
