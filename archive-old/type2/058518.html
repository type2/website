I have been thinking about the test network socket. I take it that the 
orginal device that plugged into these at VW dealers measured voltage, 
amperage, resistance, or some combination of these things. Seems like it 
would not be too hard (for someone who knows what they are doing) to make 
a circuit board and plug, and write a simple program in basic, that could 
install in an old PC/XT or similar. Ideally it would start the diagnostic 
on boot, then print. No monitor or keyboard. That would save one of those 
preposterous aluminum cast PC cases from the junkyard and a matrix 
printer too.

(I checked the archives and found very little on this socket. I refuse to 
search under &quot;thingy.&quot;)
