Subject: Re: SC/DC Dimensions

&gt;List -
&gt;
&gt;I need to know what the dimensions of the bed of the SC &amp; DC's are, as well
&gt;as the dimensions of the rear &quot;wall&quot; (made by the cabin), and sides. Oh, and
&gt;roof lengths.
&gt;
&gt;If you imagine needing the dimensions to mount a regular pick-up truck
&gt;camper on the back of a SC/DC, those are the ones I need.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks -


I don't think you will like the results.  The distance from the bottom of
the bed where the camper sits, to the top of the cab where the overhang on
the camper protrudes on an American truck is a lot different than a VW.  If
you sit a camper on the bed of a VW, the overhang will be 2 feet above the
top of the cab!!  I don't know about your taste, but I think that would
look odd.

A better solution might be to find a tent camper that opens to the side and
sit it in the bed of the VW truck.
