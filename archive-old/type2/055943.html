I am proud to announce that as of today (2 days after my eighteenth bday)  I
have finally purchased my first bus.  After years of drooling over others'
busses and about 4 years of searching for one of my own, i have finally
purchased my baby.  It's a red 71 Westy.  I was lucky enough to buy it from an
auto shop, where the owner/managers' first and true love is aircooled VW's,
although he currently runs an import shop.  The bus had been there as an extra
car to keep the mechanics busy when times were slow.  They would just keep
adding to it until someone inquired about the bus in the lot.  I grabbed it
for 2000.  The only rust is on the drivers door where there is a small dent,
but the owner is including a parts bus with a good door on it.  It has 186,000
miles on it, and it runs smooth as ever.  When i took it for a test drive i
was cruising right along at 75 (shh, don't tell, the speed limit was 35).
She's got new ball joints, CV's, brakes, windshield, seals, heating gasket,
battery, windshield wipers, etc.  Truthfully, i don't understand how they made
any money off of this bus.  They put more then 2000 dollars worth of work into
it between parts and normal shop labor costs.  But hey, i'm not complaining!
I picked up my plates today and can't wait for tomorrow afternoon when the
finishing touches are done so i can bring my baby home!  I think tomorrow may
be one of the happiest days of my [young] life!  I hope i'm not wasting too
much bandwidth, but to me...this is the best posting I've seen in ages! ;- )
peace,
dave
