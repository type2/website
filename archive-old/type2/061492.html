Subject: RE: '71 Bus hesitation

&quot;I wonder if the 009 is only suited to certain set-ups (e.g.. 34 pict 3 dual port) and maybe the bad stories are when used in combination with other - anyone looked into this?&quot;

FWIW, my 1600 dp 34pict3 with 009 runs great! The 009 came with the bus, so no way to compare as per a vacuum dizzy!
