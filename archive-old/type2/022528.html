&gt; Subject: [T2] Upper Trailing Arm Removal - Replacement
&gt;
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I was consulting with another list member about removing/replacing the
&gt; trailing arms on his bus.  Two points came up that may not be apparent
&gt; immediately when you start in on the job.
&gt;
And that would be me! Let me add a couple of things. Thanks to Steve, I'd
never have known about the clips holding the rubber stops in place,
however, mine disintegrated when I tried to remove them. I'm hoping the
ones on the old beam will come off OK or I'll be searching for new ones.
Now, the eccentric bushing: once I removed the upper arms ( a real treat I
might add) I cut off the old boots and mounted the eccentric bushing (ball
joint,arm and all) in my bench vise and proceeded to crank away with the
puller (using a 2 foot pipe as a breaker bar) and stringing together
combinations of four letter words even I've never used before in my 42 yrs
until BANG! they popped off. This whole project has become much more than I
expected when I started. I was just replacing the beam. Now I've got new
torsion arms/ball joints, all new brake lines, oh, and the &quot;damned clamp&quot;
on the sway bar? Pissed me off so much this morning I got out the Makita
grinder w/cut-off wheel and the clamps were gone in 30 seconds, so now I
need to order a new mounting kit. A lot of other things need to be done
while I've got it disassembled this far (for instance the brake fluid
reservoir is now soaking in my sink to get all the crud out) and it just
seems to make sense to do them now, but this has taken more time and far
more $$$ than I planned on. The result,though, should be a nice tight front
end that won't require any major work for a long time. As of this afternoon
I have the beam (minus the torsion arms) loosely bolted back on the bus. It
will be easier to add everything back on with it mounted to the chassis. I
tell you, this is a major undertaking that will put your love of buses to
the test! Take care, Jeff S.
