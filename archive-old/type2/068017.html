&gt;So, last night, I figgured I'd best prioritize the things I want
&gt;to do to the old bus.  I was surprised that, after thinking about
&gt;some of this on paper, the order of the tasks changed quite a bit.
&gt;I also divided the list into &quot;things that need to be done to prevent
&gt;the old bus from deteriorating any further&quot; and &quot;things that need to be
&gt;done to make the vehicle more fun or more comfortable or better looking&quot;.

&gt;What do other people do?

I don't have anything written down (probably should tho).
My current list includes:

Adding front/rear panels to the overhead tray in the cab, covering with
speaker grille material

Building custom center console slash subwoofer box for between the front seats

Have transmission rebuilt with 0/82 4th gear and 34/7 tooth ring &amp; pinion.
Dreaming about adding the limited slip differential ($$$)

Finish painting white part of exterior

Get A/C working (install compressor, replace hoses, dryer)

Buy seat covers for front seats.

Buy electric blanket (12v) for bed

Resurface camper bits with Home Depot's ultra-trick peel and stick formica!

Replace bed boards, insulate underneath

Install third solar panel

Remove both group 27 deep cycles in the engine compartment - install golf
cart batteries under the dinette seat (vented to the outside, of course).
Install solar charge regulator, VDO volt gauge, master shutoff switch, fuse
box, 75 amp circuit breaker, 10 amp shore charger.

Install gas heater in engine compartment

Paint/body work for lower half of exterior

15&quot; wheels and tires

Install CD player and 5&quot; b/w TV over the bed.

Lessee, that's only about ten thousand dollars worth of stuff, and it
should only take me about 8 years to finish it all.  No problem.  :/
