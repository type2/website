Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus starts but won't run!

The fuel pump will NOT run unless the the engine is cranking or running. If it
runs with the key on, that is wrong.

Open your engine lid and look at the big hoses going to your decel valve and
your aux air valve. One of them blew off. Reconnect it.


&gt; Hey everyone- came out of work Saturday morning and my 78 bus started
&gt; right up but then died.  Started it up again and the same thing
&gt; happened.  It is cranking fine, it just won't keep running unless I keep
&gt; my foot on the gas revving it, and it backfired a few times.  When I
&gt; turn the key to the accessories position I can not hear the fuel pump
&gt; running.  Does this mean bad fuel pump?  I am getting it towed Monday-
&gt; help!  Thanks, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus.
