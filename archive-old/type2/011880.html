Subject: child cot...do you have...
To: the great bus list &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

hey volks,
a huge thank you to all who replied to my childs cot
question.  john perry was kind enough to send me a
link to his homepage where there is a picture of one. 
so yes i do have the childs cot.  on his page it shows
the measurements for the 68 and for the 69-73 as the
same so it looks like im in business, minus one thing.
 i dont have the hooks that go on the pillars.  the
bus it came out of was stripped down inside so they
were not attached.   i looked through my couple boxes
of stuff i took from the bus and i dont see anything
that looks like em.  so does anyone on the list have a
set that they would be willing to part with?  the vw
boneyards in the midwest are basically non existant.  
if you can help me out, let me know by p-mail.
thanks
shelby
