+AD4-I have this can of paint called Zero-Rust


This looks similar to Hammerite, produced in UK by Finnegans. It's different
to regular paint in that it binds to form a more solid airtight layer, and
this is what keeps the rust at bay. You have to clean all your brushes etc
in special thinners - I believe it contains xylene and its really expensive.
Sometimes its cheaper to dump the brush.

Hammerite is used for painting outdoor metal like iron gates and it works
well. I've painted all the underside of a Ford I'm restoring and for that
matter all the underneath tinware on my camper.
