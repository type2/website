Subject: 73' Distrubutor letter (J-F)

Good day,

Need thech. info on the VW 021-905-205J and VW 021-905-205F distributor

The &quot;J&quot; Distributor is for the 73 1.7L 4 peed tranny (the one on the bus
right now = scrap soon)
The &quot;F&quot; Distributor is for the 73 1.7L auto tranny (2 spaire one in
like-new condition)

By the following link  (Thanks James!)
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm#B1973M
i see that the only diff. is the Vacuum can part #

My &quot;J&quot; is going on the garbage soon, i have 2 spare &quot;F&quot; one are like
brand new, i want to use one on my 1.7L, i don't see any part # on the
vacuum can!

What could be the problem if i use the &quot;F&quot; on my 1.7L 1973 Bus with 4
speed tranny and the &quot;J&quot; vacuum can (if original???). I guess that
timing would change!!
The link says:
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s)
connected (for the F one)
I don't have the retard hose connected, so! should i still substract
16-18 deg to give me an idle timing of 12.5 BTDC?????
What would be the total advance at 2500rpm???? 28-33???

Many thanks for any help you can give me.
Regards, Ben (please p-mail if possible)
