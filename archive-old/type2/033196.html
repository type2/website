Subject: RE: picking the right muffler set up?

I have a complete original-equipment GERMAN exhaust system on sale right now
for '64-71 for $99.95. This includes everything behind the heat exchangers -
pipes, muffler, hardware, brackets, etc. Nothing even remotely approaches
the quality of this system.  If you didn't like the Brazilian system (which
is almost certainly also made by Kadron), then you won't like the Kadron
extractor or Empi systems either.  Both are far lower quality than the
correct German system.

&gt; Subject: picking the right muffler set up?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am in the market for a new exhaust system for my 1971 Westy. I went and
&gt; purchased a stock Brazilian set up and the thing won't fit
&gt; properly so I am
&gt; going to return it and I am thinking about getting a header set up with a
&gt; single quite pack muffler. Here is my question I have heard bad
&gt; things about
&gt; Bugpack and Empi systems I am interested in anybody's opinion on
&gt; this. I was
&gt; looking in the Rocky Mountain Motors catalog and saw a Kadron
&gt; extractor and
&gt; muffler set up I am not to familiar with Kadron do they make good
&gt; products or
&gt; not. Is this something I should consider getting or should I run
&gt; away from
&gt; it? Any info would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks
