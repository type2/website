Subject: Blowing Oil and No Power (81 Vanagon Westy)

Volks,

I need some help with my 81 Vanagon Westy.  The basic symptoms are very low
power and lots of oil coming out of the rear seal, but the oil leaks only if
the van driven at speeds of 45 MPH or faster.  This is on an engine with
about 10k on a rebuild by a local shop.  The engine skips on #2 cylinder,
and I've tried all new ignition components with out success.  There is gray
goop on the inside of the oil screen cover.  I get lots of air blowing out
the PVC case vent when the PVC hose is unhooked (engine idling).

I think I'm getting excessive blowby from #2, which causes high crank case
pressure, which in turn blows oil out the rear (auto tranny end) seal.

How should I go about fixing this beast??
