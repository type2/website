Subject: Fair price vs. good price

To all: this is a matter of the meanings of words. Let's say 
(hypothetically) that Ron (Bus Depot) offers a tire for $71. You find 
it on sale locally for $63. And somebody on the Samba is selling one 
for $20.

Is Ron's $71 price for a tire a &quot;fair price&quot;? Absolutely. It's in line 
with what other on-line and mail order dealers charge for a similar 
tire. Is it a good price? Not compared to the local sale price of $63 
and definitely not compared to the Samba price of $20.

But just because, under a contingent set of circumstance, $71 is not 
the best price, it is not correct to answer the question &quot;is this a 
fair price&quot; by replying &quot;no way.&quot;

It's a fair price. You can almost always do better than a fair price, 
but you have may (probably) have to make compromises to get it.

That's how people get watches that look like Rolexes.
