Subject: Heat disipation

I was wondering something and I wanted to get the opinion of the list before
I proceed any further with the plan I am slowly developing.
Here goes.
I am under the impression that there is a better material which could be
used to pull heat off the engines than the tin provided. Obviously if you
are recieving this message then you have a computer, well electronic
components create huge amounts of heat which needs to be disipated into the
surrounding environment in order for the component to continue operation, to
do this they use heat-sinks(of different materials depending on the required
heat dissipation). So what I was wondering is if you where to somehow make
either new tins from one of these materials or in some way mount it to where
it was either in contact with or veary near to it then it should
dramatically decrease the engine temp.

Now I know the whole thing about how if it was better then they would have
used it then, but since the spread of the digital age didn't really bloom
until way after the initial design and release of the engine types we all
love so much I don't really think the materials where readily available
then.

I could be way off base here but the initial thing that lead me down this
path of thought is.....
The other day I was repairing a circuit board and I needed to remove a
component near a heatsink. I was unable to remove the component because the
heatsink was dissipating the heat from the soldering iron before it could
melt the solder. Turned the gun up, waited for it to heat attempted to
remove component again nope same thing now this continued until I had to
give up the heat sink was cooling the surface level of the part to below
melting point for the solder even when the gun was turned up to 800F. Now I
am unsure of the exact melting point of the solder I was using but I think
it was supposed to be somewhere around 300F, this means that just from
making contact with the tip of the gun the heat sink was dissipating over
500F into the atmosphere. Even if I under estimated the melting point of the
solder I was using it will still be equivalent to decreasing the surface
temperature at least 300-400F.

If this is true then, with the right modifications, PADME could run cool all
year long go many more miles between rebuilds. Right?

Well like I said just a thought if anyone out there knows anything about
this, has ever thought about it before, or just has something to say about
it, I would love to hear your comments.

Thanks,
