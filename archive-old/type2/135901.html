&lt;&lt; Also, I'm thinking about picking up a karmen Ghia (SP?) and I was
wondering if any listees have any that could P-Mail me. I've got
several questions about them.

I've had two of them over the years (coupe and convert.) and, although
I think they're really beautiful cars ('69 and earlier, the later big bumpers
and tail lights ruined the overall design...), the welded and filled body is a
Royal PITA to work on...If I was gonna get into another one the biggest
consideration would be the body...Get out the ice pick and the magnet
and go over the body and then go over it again...Unless you're Ron Co-
vell, the body will be a money pit to repair...The Beetle mechanicals are
the easy part... ;-(
