Subject: RE: [T2] Best bang for the buck tires.

&gt;I guess the tire war is on again here so what the hell, flame suit donned...

	It's doubly difficult for me as I have to shun asbestos  ...   ;-)

&gt;
&gt;   I bought the Yokohama 356's 3 years ago for my 78. I live in 
&gt;Annapolis, MD and drive my bus all year. Not a daily driver but I do 
&gt;drive it in all conditions. The 356's have been great for me. Maybe 
&gt;I am a dolt and dont know a good tire from a bad one but these now 
&gt;have 23,000 miles on them and they look great. I keep my bus aligned 
&gt;and suspension in good shape. I have not had any more problems in 
&gt;the rain with these tires than any other tire on a VW bus. Its not 
&gt;like these are the best vehicles for high speed slalom driving in 
&gt;the rain. The price was right. A lot less than the Agilis and FWIW 
&gt;these tires have done me just fine. But as always YMMV.

	I too got v good service from 6-ply-rated  Yokohama light truck tyres.
	One reason why we end up at cross purposes is that tyres' 
lifetimes differ so greatly, even for what looks like a given make &amp; 
model.  Behind that variation lurks that point I mentioned  -  if 
kept in a cool place they harden and gain longevity (at the price of 
grip).  This 'cool storage' needn't be under your house before 
they're installed  -  it can be many years ON the vehicle, if you're 
doing only a small annual mileage.
