I feel your pain.  I live in a 97 year-old condo (my building and the 
entire neighborhood was pretty much built right after the 1906 
earthquake) ... we have a garage, but it and most other garages in the 
area are not tall enough for a Westy!  (They're all slightly lower than 
the sidewalk, and the rear of the pop-top catches about 6 inches in 
from the rear -- if I could pull in level, I could probably make it.)  
I always have to do work while street-parked (at best, pulled head-in 
to my driveway, half-blocking the sidewalk).  I have to make sure the 
Bus is always running, because I have to move it at least once a week 
for street cleaning.  Sadly, this means that I have to use a mechanic 
whenever an engine drop is required :-/
