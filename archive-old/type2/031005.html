&gt; ok...here goes..
&gt; I replaced the condenser (with a bit of encouragement and a razor blade)
&gt; the ignition coil (Wells liquid filled) the spark plugs ( Bosch non
&gt; resistor) and cleaned up the distributor and rotor, put gas in, checked
&gt; all of my connections...and still no go..
&gt; I can't get the old points out cause the screw head is stripped... they
