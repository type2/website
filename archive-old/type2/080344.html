Subject: RE: [T2] More looking at vans....


Thanks for all the input!

I do want to drive it up and down  the west coast, and carry kayaks on
top, so reliability is important, plus I want it to look professional, if
any can really qualify in  that realm!

 The van is in the Newport
Beach/Anaheim area (I'm on an extended
family visit) - any mechanics anyone know of near here I can take it to?

I've actually been focusing more on later model water cooled vans lately.
Here is another question - as some of them get closer to the $10,000
range, I've been looking for lenders. Any good recommendations? Some won't
lend for a vehicle over 15 years, it turns out. I'm trying to stay away
from lots, and can't find many there anyway.

Thanks,

Andree
