&gt;&gt; Check your battery connections first.  Get a terminal cleaning brush and
some terminal spray coating at the FLAPS and get everything nice and shiny.
&lt;&lt;

I checked the Library and the Archive and can't find a definition for
&quot;FLAPS.&quot;  Is this a vendor name or a disparaging acronym like &quot;f#$% lame
auto parts store?&quot;  Thanks for continuing my education,
