&gt; Quick question: What is the trick to remove the chrome trim rings around the
&gt; headlights on a '73 Westy? I have removed the screws, and they don't want to
&gt; budge.

Use a piece of wire to hook through the hole in the ring, then pull
forward gently.  It should pop loose.  Don't use too much force or you'll
bend something.

The bus and bug trim rings are identical except for the location of the
drain holes.'
