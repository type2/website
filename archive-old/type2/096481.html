&gt; The temperature and humidity has started to go up here again and when I start my bus in the morning there is a large puff of white smoke.  I sometimes get another puff during the day when I start it up again.

&gt; I put some white paper behind the tail pipe to catch what was coming out and some water droplets are present as well as some carbon spotting.  Should I be concerned?
