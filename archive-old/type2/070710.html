Subject: Hildegarde and I are back!

Hi everyone.  I've been away from the list for a very long time. 
Almost three years.  :(

Anyway, in the time I've been away, I graduated from college, got 
married, moved to Ely, Minnesota, and now my husband and I work at 
home on our web design business.

We are going to finish the payments on our minivan &lt;cringe&gt; at the 
end of this summer, so I'm looking forward to having extra money each 
month to spend on our REAL car, the 1978 bus Hildegarde.

In these past three years Hildegarde has been in two different 
storage garages and spent all last winter covered in snow in my 
backyard.  Last week I put a new battery in 'er, ordered my 
personalized plates, and have been driving her around town.  My oil 
cooler is leaking, but what's new?  I also have no reverse.  Reverse 
has been consistently been slipping away from me since I started 
driving her eight years ago, and it's officially gone.  I know this 
because I have been pushing Hildegarde backwards to get her parked 
correctly almost as much as I've been driving her forwards.  :)

So, I'm back on the list now that I don't have to live in constant 
shame of driving a minivan and leaving a beautiful bus out to rot. 
I'm hoping to be able to build some sort of garage for next winter, 
but until then I'm not going to worry about the oil leak OR reverse. 
I'm just going to enjoy.

I'm hoping some people on the list can possibly help me locate a dear 
old bus friend.  His name is Daniel Morris and I knew him in Tampa, 
Florida during 1993-1995.  At that time he had two blue and white 
busses - on earlier split window and if I remember correctly an 
earlies 70s one as well.  Since then I have heard he is driving 
around the country working wherever he lands.  I have no idea if 
that's true but it sounds right.  :)  If anyone knows him or knows 
how to contact him, I would be so thrilled to be able to get back in 
touch with him.
