Hi yall!

I'm writing about this like anybody cares, and I don't expect anybody does, but
might as well.

I have gotten the 46mm axle nut off (THANKS to everybody's suggestions!)

I understand the stuff in there!  (Yay for simple, good designs.)
I got the new wheel cylinder and brake pads all put together and happy.
I put the drum back on, yanked the parking brake handle and released it,
and then, starting with the left 'star', I opened it out until it wouldn't 
turn easily, and then backed it off FIVE clicks.  Wheel turns.  Then I 
did the other star, and backed it off five clicks.  Wheel still turns 
with minimal sounds.  Now putting the nut back on, I wonder about that.
V-Dub shop guy says &quot;hammer the thing on there with a sledgehammer like
there's no tomorrow&quot;

Chilton says &quot;271 ft/lbs&quot;.  

I only have the  bottle opener tool and a ball peen hammer.  The left nut 
looks like it's on past 4 threads.  This one will have a long way to go for
that.

I'm gonna get this far on the other wheel tomorrow.  Should I get it on 
&quot;tight&quot; and drive to a truck stop and have it air-wrenched on??  Or am
I overestimating how much 271 ft.lbs is?

As always, I welcome all and any advice!

BTW, I guess the front brakes are going to be the same movie (69 camper)...  
Maybe just a little less stuff with no parking brake.  Correct?
