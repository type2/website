&gt; Thought you might like to see his bus.

I guess its easy now to wash the roof now. I would have just bought a ladder
though ;-)

&gt; Didn't get a picture of his window crank handles ......... small vise
&gt; grips permanently clamped to the crank shafts. Matching pair, no less.

Probably don't even have to make a complete turn to wind the window
all the way down!
