Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injector Plastic Tip

&gt; Hello.
&gt; 
&gt; I am re-doing some fuel injectors on my '78 and I want to replace the
&gt; plastic tip that covers the injector.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?  -what are they called;

It is called the pintle cover.

I would have the injectors rebuilt at a shop, tho. I'll rebuild darn near
anything, but I think injectors are best left to a specialist, there are
some specialized tools and machines needed. If the pintle covers are so bad
as to need replacing, there might be other issues with the injectors also. I
have never seen injector rebuild kits - this is such a specialized area that
I doubt if type of kit would be in demand by anyone other than injector
shops.
