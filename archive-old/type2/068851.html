&gt;
&gt;I'd like a confirmation denial of my diagnosis of a problem.  To whit:
&gt;
&gt;Symptoms:
&gt;- the battery indicator tends to drop down to yellow a day or two
&gt;  after charging with a battery charger
&gt;- while the engine is on, the green indicator is on
&gt;- immediately after turning the engine off, the indicator usually
&gt;  stays green for ten minutes or so, then turns yellow
&gt;- new battery, old one replaced due to the above symptoms, no change
&gt;
&gt;Diagnosis:
&gt;- since this happens with old and new batteries, and the voltage is
&gt;  apparently fine during operation, the voltage regulator is
&gt;  not functioning correctly.
&gt;
&gt;Yes/no/other?
&gt;

   Not that you wn't get a number of replies etc. :-)

 I'd disconnect the battery during the down time and see what that does. I'm
more inclined to believe a short in the system.
