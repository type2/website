&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Just bought my '68 Westy and it has a three band radio in it which we found
&gt;rather odd although this may not be? The third band doesn't seem to pick up
&gt;anything at all and the bands are labeled U, L and M. I have the schematic
&gt;in the manuals I got with my camper.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me what this third band is for?
&gt;

Jen,

I think the following is correct:

AM Band= &quot;M&quot;
FM Band= &quot;U&quot;
Shortwave= &quot;L&quot;

It sounds like you might have a vintage Blaupunkt or (even better!).
a Becker radio.  Two places can help you with this but the second one
has a much better web site for viewing old radios (an very high prices!):

Continental Imports (Florida, I think):

http://www.continentalimports_dot_com

Walter Odemer, Inc.:

http://www.primenet_dot_com/~odemer

If you visit the Odemer site, click on &quot;antique radios&quot; and see if you
can find your unit.  If not, e-mail Walter for a verification and
repair quote--he always gets back to you in a couple of days.

Good luck,
Craig in CO
