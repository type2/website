&gt;i _think_ the table thnigie is the same until at least 
&gt;1971??
My '71 has one.  Obviously, I can't tell if it's EXACTLY like what a '67 is
supposed to have, but I can't imagine why VW would change something like this.
Mine's a (from memory) chrome plated disk about 1.75&quot; dia. with about a .5&quot;
dia. female threaded hole in the center for the table leg, and three small
holes around the edge to screw it to the floor.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; cant understand what yr #2 zoobie is.
&gt;
&gt;i think RVB is referring to the small &quot;female&quot; brass &quot;catch&quot; 
&gt;that sits behind the fold out table. it catches on the back 
&gt;of the table (there is a &quot;male&quot; thing it grabs ;) and keeps 
&gt;the table from flopping around/rattling while  you are 
&gt;driving.
If this is what you're talking about, it sounds like this is on the later
busses, too.  My '71 has a similar feature, though I think it's steel not
brass.  Kind of U-shaped and attaches to the wall at the bottom.
