Subject: Re: [T2] NOT sad news, but a question

&gt;On your oil leak, there is a lot going on around the #4 cylinder corner of
&gt;the T4 engine.  The oil cooler is there, the oil pressure sender is there,
&gt;there is splash from a leaking rear main seal, and there is splash from
&gt;leaking push rod tubes on the 3/4 side of the engine.  My experience has
&gt;been that the most common cause of leaks in this corner (other than the
&gt;pushrods, which are just a &quot;fact of life&quot;) is the leaking oil pressure
&gt;sender, but YMMV... as I said, there is a lot going on there.

I'd chime in for leaking oil FILTER more common than you think.  Cooler
does leak a lot too.  Both of these at their joints, not the actual filter or 
cooler itself very often.

John
