Subject: Exhaust manifold stud

Hey everybody-

Well, it seems that whenever I write to the list, some damn thing has
gone wrong.  It's never to respond or to just say how things in my
favorite purple bus are going.  Nope.  Something is afoul.  But, before
I launch into my tale of woe, I should give you a bit of background
info.

So, my wife comes to pick me up at the ferry terminal one drizzly
evening in October (I live on Bainbridge Island and work in Seattle).
Immediately upon arriving, she jumps out of the driver's seat gasping
for breath telling me that the gas smell inside the car was so strong
she felt sick.  As she walked around gulping clean air, I noticed a
strange dripping coming from the underside of the bus.
Hmm...  gas.  gas?  GAS!!!
As the implications of that explosive flow hit, she says, &quot;Hop in.  We
should be able to make it home before we run out of gas!&quot;  &quot;What?!?&quot;  I
am picturing a very colorful explosion in downtown Winslow.  Nope.  Not
my bus.  I ran over to the coffee shack near by and snagged a 5 gallon
bucket, filled it with water, and, with a tall latte cup, I tossed cold
water onto the hot underside of the engine (SSSSsssssssss.....).

&quot;Honey, would you go and hail one of those taxis.  We are not driving
home tonite.&quot;

So we call AAA the next day.  The driver that showed up was the same guy
who towed the bus three years ago when the clutch cable broke which was
the repair that got me hooked on these funny cars we all drive.  The tow
truck driver just grinned and said that he had his old bus towed once or
twice when he drove a splittie.  Great.  Just get it home.  I was not
thrilled with the whole thing.  But, he did do a great job hooking up
and also backing the bus up my driveway.  Not bad.

Time to pull the engine.  We have all been there.  A few choice curses,
a scrape or two, balance, balance, yep.  Got the motor out.  The front
panel was a bit of a puzzle.  Why the heck would VW have two screws
coming up from below to hold that thing on?  The handful on the engine
side weren't enough?  Hmm...

Well, I pulled all the hoses top and bottom and also the boot that
connects the tank to the filler hose.  AHA!  Nasty and cracked!  Toast.
Time to find a new one.  Also, I pulled the filler neck gasket and the
hose since the neck gasket was ripped too.

At this point, the mind looks at the engine sitting on the ground and
says, &quot;I realize that this job was to replace whatever it was that was
leaking gas, but, since the motor's out... I can pull all the FI stuff
off, all the tin, clean the b'jezis out of the case, yank the fan
housing off the back, all new gaskets, new seals, clean the tranny,
engine compartment, etc.&quot;  You get the picture.  Meanwhile, I was
compiling my parts list.  Some of the stuff I needed, I bought at my
FLAPS and the rest I ordered.  Here it is, the middle of November, and
my bus is finally off jack stands and running, sort of (I'll get to that
in a sec).  Part of the reason it took sooooooooo damn long to get Huey
back on the road was my somewhat incovenient work schedule- I work for
the Seattle Children's Theatre and we work every day but Monday.  On
that day, all the other stuff that gets put aside also screams for
attention.  That certainly would have added some time to the fix and
reinstall.

Trying to find that tank to filler hose boot also was a problem.  Seems
that the VW dealer (the only one who had this part) wanted $95 for this
5&quot;x2 1/4&quot;i.d. hose.  Nope.  I will look elsewhere.  I tried marine
suppliers first assuming that large a diameter fuel hose would be common
on ocean going vessels.  Not really.  Well, they had it but the stuff
was so stiff, that it would not flex or clamp at all.

I ended up buying what I needed at a NAPA who first tried to sell me a 2
1/4&quot; radiator hose instead of the fuel rated, reinforced stuff.  &quot;Oh
yeah, this'll do the trick for ya, all right.&quot;  Where do they find these
guys?!  I am no automotive genius, but then again I do not work in the
field.  If I did, I would hope to be more in tune than these two guys
were.  But, instead of $95, I payed $7.00.

Also, the manufacturers who made the filler neck gasket decided, about
the time my engine came out, to stop making that part.  Every single
source I called said that their usual suppliers just stopped selling
it.  Luckily I found a junk yard gem in perfect shape for transplant
into my ailing '77.

But the biggest delay I had was parts that I had already ordered
staggering in over a 1 1/2 month period.  I was told that it would all
go out pretty quickly.  I assumed (foolish me) that it was all in stock
or not back ordered at suppliers and available for drop shipment.  You
would think that a parts dealer would keep their clients informed as to
retain their future business (our cars are old and in need of some
tender loving care from time to time.)  These guys have some great
prices and the shipping is reasonable but their service sucks.  But
venting about this headache is not the reason for my post.

After getting everything back in and hooked up properly, time for the
fateful First Startup of the newly tweaked engine came.
As the fresh oil squwoojed around and about inside the motor and settled
the sound a bit, an odd noise that did not exist before stayed around.
Kind of a hammering/pinging sound.  Exhaust.  Yep.  I had one exhaust
manifold stud that would not go back in, regardless of my efforts and
curses.  So I grabbed another stud off the spare T4 head I had in my
shed.  It screwed into the case quite nicely but, the when I started
torquing upon it, the tension would increase a bit then release.  Hmm,
its not biting.  So I went out today and bought a new stud with a bit
deeper threads and a bolt of the same diameter and approximate length.
Same problem.  Crap.

So, this is the problem I write to y'all with.  How can I fix this stud
without pulling my motor again.  I just don't have the time and, if the
bus is down for any more time, my wife is gonna kill me!  So, what can I
do?  I have a couple ideas but I would love to hear what you suggest.

Thanks so much for your help,

Matthew Zipeto
