Subject: Fwd: [T2] Gas tank outlet nut

&gt;Bob: I just pulled the fuel tank from my Ghia yesterday and have the 
&gt;outlet nut on the workbench. I don't know whether or not this is the 
&gt;same as for a T2, but here is the info.

The thread is definitely 1.0. I measured this with a thread gauge.

Unfortunately, the diameter does not seem to be standard, at least 
not in my garage.

I have a set of threaded male stud-like gauges. The size of the gas 
tank outlet nut is greater than M16 and smaller than M20.  My guess 
would be M18, but my set doesn't have an M18 gauge.

So my guess would be M18 x 1.0.

I don't have a die of this size in my set.

Jack
