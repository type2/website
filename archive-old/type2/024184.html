Subject: loss of power- fuel pump
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I was thinking, my fuel pump was &quot;repaired&quot; not replaced, think this may have
attributed to my power loss on the hill, as well as some jumpy
accel/deceloration sometimes?  In looking to replace it, should I go original,
or eletric, or whatever, any ideas?

Thanks
Shawn
