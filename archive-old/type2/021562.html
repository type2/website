Chuck:
Good point, Chuck. I've had pretty good luck with mothballs placed at several
places around the vehicle. Interionr mostly, as that's their favorite source
of material, but I suppose the engine compartment needs a few as well.
Of course the other preventative is: CATS. I have those in good supply,
though not at my shop. That gets me thinking, I think I've seen a mouse or
two there recently!!
I believe you could see the edges of mouse activity in an engine with one of
those little battery operated scopes. Where can you get those things?
