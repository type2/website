Subject: Summer evening destination

Hi, folks -

One of the primary topics of conversation among VW people are new 
destinations.  Here is a suggestion for a nice summer evening ride to a 
free concert in Longview, Washington.  Thursday July 19th  6:00 - 8:00 
pm in Lake Sacajawea Park at Martin's Dock.  The ByrdBrains perform 
two hours of The Byrds.  Beautiful setting, family-oriented, 
VW-friendly, FREE.  Bring dinner and enjoy some great music from the 
Sixties while showing your ride.  A short, scenic drive out Hwy. 30 West 
to Longview, or a shorter drive up I-5 to Longview 4 West.

Tell all your friends - I've told both of mine!

Cheers,
Kurt Selvig
