Subject: Re: [T2] new battery, not alternator, maybe a short?

Kyle,

You have something turned on that is drawing a fair amount of power.

You only need to remove one cable from the battery.

Start removing fuses one at a time until you find the one that
stops the large drain on the battery,  Then find out what is hooked up
on that fuse.

You *do* have the ignition off and the radio off and the doors closed and 
the lights off when you are measuring, right?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Okay,
&gt; It is dropping at a very steady pace. about .01 volts per second.
&gt; Also, someone said I could just remove the ground strap when I park.
&gt; Is this okay or should i remove both?
