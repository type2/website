Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions Test Maryland 79 Bus

Hi Tony,

That statistic is more than a decade out of date. It ignores the  
energy recovered by using wastes from the distillation produce as  
feedstock for domestic animals. There are a LOT of ways that these  
byproducts can be utilized. Then start using more efficient methods to  
distill and your yeild per btu gets a LOT higher.

Another little-known fact is that petroleum distillation also uses  
more energy than it produces. We're throwing away more than we use no  
matter how we get the fuel.

Happy trails,

Greg

&gt; i.e. you
&gt; could just be putting in more BTU's to make ethanol from corn
&gt; than you get back burning the ethanol... ;-(
