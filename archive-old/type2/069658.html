Subject: Re: Re- Historical changes 62-6

I myself always thought this was the case (and still do).  BUT there is a VW
*guru* at home in 
Aus (he owns the only barn door deluxe I've ever seen - at least until I go
and
check out Thom's) who blindly swears that the extra two rear corner windows
were available as a factory *option* from 64-67.  He even gets *quite*
excited
about it - would anyone care to comment?  
- - - - 
never heard of it.   never heard of the option.  dont think so

the only comment is that they are still making corner window buses in brasil,
but that's a whole nother kettle of fish
