&gt; Also, my oil temp got up to nearly 280 degrees for a short bit. Is this

never let my oil temp get over 250, and slow down at 240 or so...only got
that high once when the fan came off the crankshaft, and it wouldn't start
til it cooled down.

&gt; One other anomaly- a friend who should know told me to prop the engine
&gt; door open to facilitate air flow and keep things cooler. I tried this
&gt; today (400 miles), and after 200 miles shut the door because the temps
&gt; were so high. Amazing, but it actually ran cooler with the door shut. I
&gt; surmise perhaps the exhaust heat was being sucked in there rather than
&gt; cool, fresh air.

yup the folks at VW actually knew what they were doing, only time this
seems to help is when your standing still.

&gt; Well, I've downloaded tyhe AIRS site, so if I have a REAL problem, at
&gt; least I can calls someone.

good to have handy, have never needed my copy but always keep the list for
the states I will be in, in the van

have a safe and fun trip
