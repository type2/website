&gt;&gt; &gt;My question is.  How do we
&gt;&gt; &gt;get it started?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Check the oil... spray some wd-40 on the battery straps, remove battery
&gt;&gt;and put
&gt;&gt; on a couple of phone books and trickle charge it overnight. In the morning,
&gt;&gt; put battery in, make sure the fan belt isn't super loose. start it up
&gt;&gt;and let
&gt;&gt; it run for a half hour....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Chris, Chuck:
&gt;I think I'd drain and flush the fuel tank and probably have to take the
&gt;carb apart and clean it out too....

I also wouldn't be so keen on firing a long-time non-runner straight off.
There will be like *no* oil in many key places in the motor, and the oil
pump will take a short while (but a critical short while) to get good oil
pressure to these places.  In the meantime, you'll be firing the motor with
oil starvation in these places.  Also, the oil sitting in the pan may well
be rotten, rotten, rotten.  That combination is a Bad Thing.

So, do what the others suggest, but also:

* Change the oil before rotaing the motor
* Disconnect the coil wire and crank the ignition to spin the motor without
combustion until the oil pressure comes up.
* reconnect the coil, and fire it up, idle it for a while, warm it up.
* change the oil and filter again.

And check out the brakes, tires, and steering really carefully.

Have fun!
