&gt; I hope Mick is happy that he is at least getting SOME answers to his
&gt; question this time.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't recall exactly what engine the on-line blurb I read was
&gt; testing, but
&gt; seem to remember that the black paint ran 10 degrees (oil) cooler
&gt; than the
&gt; other colors tested. Mick'll havta go look for the write-up.

I'd be suspicious of the validity of such tests.  There are a lot of
variables that fall into the equation and can often muddle the results.
It would be better to make the test as simple as you can.  

What I would do is to use a few soda cans.  Put the various coatings
(bare, white, black, stripes) on the cans.  Fill the cans with oil. 
Drop a power resistor into the &quot;bare&quot; can and hook it up to a variable
power supply.  Put a thermometer into the can and adjust the power
input until the temperature stabilizes at 100C.  Now swap the resistor
to the other cans and see if they stabilize at different temperatures. 
Throughout this process, you have to ensure that the ambient
temperature remains constant and that there is consistant and identical
airflow over the cans (wind tunnel time!).

Once you get your data, you have to decide if it is applicable to your
engine.  If your engine now rejects 1% of its waste heat via radiation,
then doubling the efficiency of radiation will mean that your are now
rejecting 2% of the waste heat via radiation, a whopping 1% increase! 
OTOH, if radiation accounts for 10%, then it becomes significant.

&gt; If the color is NOT important on a particular engine, may I suggest a
&gt; hot
&gt; pink, with alternating horizontal green, orange, and purple stripes.

This engine would definitely run cooler, because everyone who saw it
would... 

(how do I put this delicately?)

...umm, &quot;leave their lunch&quot; on the engine, cooling via evaporation.
