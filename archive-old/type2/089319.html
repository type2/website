Subject: Re: [T2] knocking in the rear end


I had a mysterious knocking in the rear that I could not locate until one
day I looked in the rear view mirror and saw blue smoke rising from the
engine compartment, pulled over and opened the engine hatch expecting
perhaps a fire. Instead I saw nothing, at first. Then I saw the fan belt
lying to one side of the engine. The inner half of the generator pulley had
literally broken into pieces although the hub was still on the shaft. The
source of blue smoke had been the fan belt being chewed before it was
flipped.. With the installation of a new pulley the mysterious knocking
disappeared. Presumably it had been caused by an out of round, out of
balance failing pulley.

Let me hasten to add that I suspect what happened to me was a very rare
occurrence and not likely to be the source of your knocking.

The lesson, however, is to consider everything, not just the usual suspects.

Cheers
