Subject: Re: re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob's tome

Re knowing when valve adjustor is just touching valve end- I do this by
feel- make sure the screw can turn freely (back off the nut) and turn it
by hand until you just feel the resistance.  I can feel it even with a
spongy nonpumped lifter.  As to number of turns, anything that keeps the
piston within its extremes will actually work, that's why you have
hydraulic lifters!  Those advocating just one turn assume that it will
only get tighter with warmup and over many miles, thus increasing the
time that it will stay within range.  If your lifter is not pumped up,
then using only a half turn means that the valve will open very little
until lifter is pumped.
