Subject: RE: [T2] Where's my engine number?

My kids a really cool. I have a girl who is 5 and a boy who is 2. THEY LOVE
VWs!! They are always asking to help work on my VWs. Kids that age are
actually quite good for some tasks. I recently dumped out a can of mixed
fasteners and had them sort the nuts from the bolts from the washers etc.

They are going to their second Bug-O-Rama with me day after tomorrow. I even
talked the wife into going this time :)


&gt;Yeah, as much as it may suck, it's probably a
&gt;good thing to pay attention to the KIDS every
&gt;once in a while.. hahaha :) :) :)
