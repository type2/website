&gt; (1) Next time I'll put things in writing, i.e., type up a *precise*
&gt; and unmistakably clear description of the job I want to have done and
&gt; have the manager please sign it.
&gt; 

I'm sorry to hear this but even writing stuff out doesn't guarantee anything.
I've done it everytime I've had someone do the work for me (write out 
everything I want to have done) and they still screw it up.  There's 
nothing like doing a job yourself but in this case, it doesn't seem like 
you had much of a choice.
