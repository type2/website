Subject: Door handle

I am looking for a door handle for the front passenger side.
I can't seem to find one locally that is quite right.
Mine has a bit larger hole for the tumbler assembly.
It is about 17mm in diameter.
There is a part# (I think): 211.837.205.1/2

I want to just swap tumbler assemblies so I can use one key.
OR I heard you can file the tumblers or something. Is that so? What is the
secret?
Any help would be appreciated.

Later,
Jim
