Ron, I did that on mine and never had a problem for
many years. -BaH

&gt; I have a '76 2.0 FI bus and the distributor is

&gt; assy 90 degrees  
&gt; CW so that the CSV connector is no longer is
&gt; blocked. It seems to me  
&gt; this should be possible if I also move the spark
&gt; plug wires by 90  
&gt; degrees CW. Should this work, or are there other
&gt; factors wrt  
&gt; distributor orientation that would prevent it?
