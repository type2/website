Subject: RE: [T2] Stud?

&gt; I noticed an increase in my exhaust noise the other day and
&gt; went through
&gt; everything ensuring all was tight.  Turns out one of my
&gt; exhaust studs on
&gt; ole #3 is stripped and will not allow me to tighten my j-tube down.
&gt;
&gt; I did a quick search at lunch of the archives but didn't see whether a
&gt; helicoil or other type fix could be accomplished with the
&gt; head installed.
&gt; Any suggestions?

I have now successfully installed 2 TimeSerts (www.timesert_dot_com) for exhaust
studs on #3 and #2 without removing engine or heads.  It's a little tricky
getting everything square and straight while working upside down under the
engine, but it can be done.  Take care to plug the exhaust ports so no metal
shavings bounce their way back into the engine.  Since the regular T-handled
tap tools won't fit in there with all the other engine stuff around, I used
appropriately sized sockets and/or small wrenches to turn the taps and
insertion tools for the TimeSerts.  I used the Big-Sert kit for 8mm, and now
use straight 8mm/8mm studs instead of the 9mm/8mm stepped studs that used to
be there.  You can call TimeSert and order the kits directly.  I think I
paid about $60 for the 8mm BigSert kit.  Well worth it to save the hassle of
tearing down engine to take the heads to a machinist IMHO.
