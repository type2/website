Subject: RE: [T2] Tires (again)

A little more searching and taking some advice from list members, I
found the Yokohama Y356 tires 185 R14 in load C and D will work for
Busses. Although I think the D load is worth it for the extra $11. They
have them for $61, but they have to be special ordered from most
warehouses. I am going to call around locally and see if I can find
them, but I doubt it in this small town.

They also have this tire in Load D 195/75 R14.

Thanks for everyone inputs

Corbett
