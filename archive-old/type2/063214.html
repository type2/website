&gt;It doesn't matter that the distributor shaft is lined up

&gt;and that the other wires are hooked up for the correct firing
&gt;order after that.  So that others can figure out what's going
&gt;on, it is a good idea to rotate the distributor around so that
&gt;the line on the rim is lined up with the rotor when this
&gt;happens, but it's not always possible for various reasons
&gt;(breather box in the way, whatever).  On my '72 bus, it's 180
&gt;degrees off, even though I'm using the correct distributor.
The only thing I would like to add is that it's sometimes a BIT
important to have the #1 plug wire/rotor aligned with the line on
the rim because SOME (but I think not ALL) 009 distributors have
the 3 degree or so retard built in for cylinder #3.  If you have
one of those models, then if you didn't have the mark lined up
with the #1 wire, some cylinder other than #3 would be getting
the late spark.  If all the lobes on the distributor cam are the
same then I agree it doesn't matter which position #1 plugs into.
And in either case, it doesn't matter about how the body of the
distributor is positioned relative to the engine case, other than
for physical problems such as plug wires not reaching or the
condensor hitting something.

&gt;One way to make sure that you have it right is to get it to TDC
&gt;for #1 using the old distributor.  Or you can look down the
&gt;spark plug hole with a mirror and a flashlight and check that
&gt;both valves are closed and the piston is at the top if you're
&gt;not sure.
This is an important point and one that's often overlooked or
misunderstood.  Just because the mark on the pulley indicates
the engine is at TDC, it doesn't mean the #1 plug is ready to
fire.  Remember:  The engine is ALSO at TDC between the exhaust
and intake strokes.  As Dennis says, check the position of the
rotor if the old distributor is still installed, or check the
valves.
