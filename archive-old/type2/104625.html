Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump on T1 engine?

&gt;The stock mechanical pump works well.  So I really don't understand
&gt;why you would want a noisy electric one.  Which do you think would
&gt;be more reliable, a non-rebuildable pump with its own electric powered
&gt;pumping mechanism, or a rebuildable pump powered by your engine?

And aftermarket electric pumps need some sort of switch to stop them if the 
engine stalls (such as after an accident).

Oil pressure switch...
