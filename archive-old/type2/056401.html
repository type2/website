 Bus&quot; -- (RE: oil t  [ &quot;Stephen Gutknecht (type2)&quot; &lt;IML-TY ]
&gt;   Help: Broken axle stub on '81 Westy   [ Dan Burgos &lt;dburgos_at_acsu.buffalo.ed ]
Friday I replaced both the turn signal switch and the windscreen washing
switch.  A couple wires went into the fuse panel and could not tell how
to remove the female spade connector from the plastic block.  I opted to
leave the connector in the fuse panel and splice the wire using a butt
connector.  Each new wire was connected where the matching color old wire
went - one wire at a time.  I had a couple wires left over on the wwashing
switch as the replacement had 2 wires my original switch did not have.
Both switches work on the first try!

On the interior, I put in a used dome light fixture and sliding door handle
both bought at the '98 VW Classic car show.  The dome light is the larger
one with the silver bezel.  The original one melted and the switch broke.
I spent a long time finding this little gem.  The door handle is the odd
shaped camper model that also has a grip area above the pivot/attach bolt.
These both worked the first try also.

I hit a snag when I looked into the EGR not working.  The EGR valve has
stopped working because the lever has worn out.  I found a couple other
worn out EGR valves in the junkyard and between the three I could not
make one work.  The VW dealer says it is P/N 022 131 501F and is obsolete.
It's for a '78 type2 and has the mechanical pushrod actuator. Anyone know
of a resource for this valve.  It was hot weather this weekend and I want
to get the EGR going again to help my engine run cooler.  Plus, it keeps
my bus from stinkin' up the great outdoors.

Overall, a good weekend for the bus.
