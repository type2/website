Subject: Re: [T2] Filling the throttle plate hole and the 009

Hiya Greg,

Yep, I've seen this &quot;fix&quot; too.  The idea is basically to fill in the hole in 
the butterfly with a rivet.  This is supposed to help the carb run a little 
richer in order to compensate for the advance on the 009.  The idea is that 
the richer the mixture at low rpms, the less chance you'll run into the 
&quot;stumble&quot; the 009/34PICT3 is known for.
The problem with this setup, as I see it, is that you are working on the 
wrong part.  While the 34PICT3 can be a finicky beast, and tuning it can help 
reduce the &quot;stumbling&quot;, the 009 is the source of the problem.  It's fully 
advanced by 2800 rpms which is great for racing but less than desireable for 
daily driving (unless you do all your daily driving at the track).  The only 
way IMHO to cure the beast is to go with another more suitable dizzy for 
daily driving.
By the way, I had to live with a 009/34PICT3 set-up for awhile.  Changed it 
out to an SVDA and a 30/31.  Rock solid combination.  Those who I have talked 
to about the &quot;plugging the butterfly&quot; (in my book the same as &quot;rearranging 
deck chairs on the Titanic) have had mixed results with it.  Some have seen 
absolutely no change and others have seen a lessening of the 009 stumble.  
However, none that I have spoken to have seen the problem completely solved 
going this route.
