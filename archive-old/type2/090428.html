Subject: Re: [T2] 1st time siting; no oil drain plug?

Hey Steve,

A typical oil change involves changing the oil and the
iol filter.  Guess what?  You don't have a typical oil
filter.  Your oil filter is that screen.  Every oil
change, you should take out the screen, clean it
nicely, and then reinstall it.  Just draining the oil
is like never changing your oil filter.  

And yes, VW recognized this, so in later model bugs,
they switched to the plate you have with no drain
plug.  I've seen oil plates come out with sludge
almost half an inch thick.  And this sludge is in the
screen as well.  So when your engine is sucking oil,
its sucking the sludge as well.  

Forget about the drain plug, keep the plate you have,
always clean the screen, and enjoy a nice long lifed
engine.

&gt; hi - two weeks ago i adopted a stray AHxxxxxx engine
&gt; out of a 71 hardtop
&gt; westy. nice deal upon closer inspection - DP heads
&gt; have brand new guides,
&gt; all the dog house thermostat stuff is there
&gt; including hoover bit, and i
&gt; fig'd, well what to do with this case. i went to
&gt; undo the oil plug and to
&gt; my surprise odd strainer with no plug. just six 10mm
&gt; nuts under the sump.
&gt; research shows this is a 74bug engine. did they
&gt; really have to undo all
&gt; those nuts to change oil? can that plate be replaced
&gt; with one having a
&gt; plug. heavens to betsy  - steve, dun't remember ever
&gt; driving a bug...
