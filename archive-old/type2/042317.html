Subject: 71 westy idle/performance ?s

I have had my 71 westy on the road for two weeks after a 10 year
hibernation.  

Question 1: I have noticed that when cold, she will not idle at all.  When I
am at a stop light she just falls right on her face.  However, when warm
(after being ran for about 10 minutes) it idles very healthily.

Question 2:  If I do not REALLY race the engine before I let the clutch out,
it will want to stall.  It also chugs and acts like it is missing when under
load.  I usually compensate by downshifting but I think 50 mph in 3rd is a
little hard on the motor.

Any suggestions welcome (within the boundaries of good taste : ))
