Subject: RE: [T2] tires/speedo

Moral of the story, if you run stock tires 185/R14, the speedo is accurate.

I have the same observation with the speedometer as well with the same tire.
However, my odometer is 2 tenths of a mile short when I test at check post
along side the interstate.  That is only an observation never tested beyond a
casual glance at the odometer.  When you are in a bus and going uphill and see
one of those radar signs and you are able to make the speed limit it is cause
for a smile.
