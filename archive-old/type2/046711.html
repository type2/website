Subject: [T2] rebuilt bus axles  -  can i get them

I know of a place that sells rebuilt 1/2 axles (CV joints, boots, and axles
already put together).  haven't called them yet to check availability of '77
axles, but was wondering if the axles are the same for vanagons, b/c I'm
almost certain they'd have those. I know the CV joints, and hence boots are
the same. are the axles the same??  (please say yes)


TIA,
