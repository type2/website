Subject: Re: General Oil Notes - Was: Synthetic oil vs. Regular


	Lots of good discussion here. A few more points:
	1) Service ratings SC was current when I was a kid- SL is later,
and higher, than SJ. Better oil? Probably. Higher letter, later standard.
Do a web search on API and you'll probably find more about this.

	2) Go 4K or 5K between changes? Hard to say. I do sometimes, in 
watercooled cars. Been 3K in an Type 2 too. Back in the SF/SG days 
an SAE study showed that the additive packages IN MULTIVISCOSITY PRODUCTS 
were significantly degraded by about 3K miles (at freeway cruise in
a V8? In compound low in a off-roading 4 banger? Define your terms!)
In the aforementioned multiviscosity products, when the additives are
gone, you're left with the base stock, the smaller number. Wanna run 5W,
10W or even 20W in an aircooled VW? Nah, neither do I. But if you're
running straight 30W, in a T4 or with a real filter, you might well
consider increasing your change interval and seeing what happens. I
look forward to reading your reports. You're doing science.

	3) I DO run multivis (20W-50) because I do change every 1500-3000
miles and I DO believe that modern (SG &amp; later) multivis is that much b
etter than the SC oil that our 1970 pickup was made for. As long as the 
additives last, at temperature, its like 50W. That's good. If I'm proved 
wrong it will be on my head, but we run pretty few miles per year (Not sure 
the milage, we filled the tank twice in 1999...) and it will be another decade
before the engine, presently with about 15K miles on it, is even near the
75K miles I expect. No, it's neither a GEX rebuild nor one I did.

	4) Not sure about heat rejection/specific heat, and I recognize that
there is a potential issue there- VWs are partially air cooled, partially
OIL COOLED. That's why VWs with bitty little horsepower ratings and
small displacements have oil coolers. OTOH, Porsche used Mobil-1 in their
last, rather highly stressed, aircooled motors, so its hard to believe
it can't be made to work. Maybe the argument is that the VW oil cooler
isn't suited to it. Sounds like a marginal case to me.

	5) Since my filterless Type 2 needs an oil change pretty regularly,
even with non-stock hydraulic tappets, I don't see any sense in throwing 
out good synthetic at $4/qt when I can throw out Penzoil or Quaker State
at $1-1.50/qt. Of course the synthetic is better oil, but that much
better? So far my wallet says no. Considering synthestic's legendary
slipperyness, I'm probably wrong. :)

	6) I thought the Consumer Reports study on NYC taxis was well executed 
foolishly designed. Taxis run for hours a day, fully warmed up, idling at 
the curb or in dense traffic, occasionally accelerating their loads through 
automatic transmissions. There can't be an easier environment for an
engine oil. Any API CF or whatever was the minium works, sure. If I 
owned a taxi company with water cooled Detroit products, I'd buy K-Mart
oil or whatever.
	Compare to our pickup truck, which gets started from stone-cold,
a time when I've heard most wear occurs; with a little raw gas from 
startup in the cold cylinders getting past the rings; along with who 
know what wierd partial combustion products, and even water, 
runs without a filter, at higher RPM and higher % of rated power than an
urban taxi, and then when hot gets shut down and cooks.

	Your milage may vary. Happy motoring!
