Have you checked out your points &amp; timing? Also I would really double
check any vacuum leaks. You can check these out by letting it run &amp;
using starting fluid, spray it in areas. If it speeds up you have a
vacuum leak my friend.

&gt; As of tonight, on a cold start, the engine will run high as it usually
&gt; does when warming up, but not for nearly as long as it needs to.  After
&gt; about 15 seconds, it drops, starts to hesitate really bad, oil light
&gt; comes on, then it revs back up (when it doesn't die).  Repeat this
&gt; process a few times.  When I take it one the road, it is ok, but has
&gt; slight power loss.  When I come to a light, idles really rough and oil
&gt; light comes on.  

This is what my 79 did when i had a vacuum leak.

&gt; This bus is my baby but I have to admit that I don't
&gt; know a lot about them.  Young and still learning.  But, back in the day
&gt; I had a vacuum leak that was enormous.  Had to keep the engine reved up
&gt; just to make it to the shop...is this possibly a small leak that is
&gt; getting worse at a quick rate?  If so, where to I check for them?  I
&gt; have some starting fluid, but don't know where to spray. 

shoot, i should have read further. My leak was where the throttle
connects to the intake manifold. I would try here and also where the
manifold and the runners connect. 

&gt; Also, I don't
&gt; know if I have the time or the knowledge to fix this on my own and this
&gt; is my primary vehicle. 

Yes you can. Just plan on a late night at least once. :) Remember
there are several people on this list that are up late.
