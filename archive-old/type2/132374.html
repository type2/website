Subject: High temp POR-15 no match for VW heat

It took a bit of time and effort to coat my exhaust system in the silver
high temp POR 15, so I am sad to note that it all turned a roasted corn
color on the first drive.  It does not appear that is on there for the long
haul, though it claims to be rated to at least 500 F.  Does anyone have any
alternative suggestions?  Powder coat would be sweet but maybe expensive?  I
just want it to last a while, and it seems to be a rust magnet.
Thanks in advance, Nik
