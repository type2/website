&gt; Does anyone knows where the problem is? Can it be fixed or do I need to get

Over the years, quite a few parts just wear out. It would have
happened just the same with only the driver. What you want to do is
crawl under there and look. Get comfortable and have a helper turn the
steering wheel back and forth. Just enough to start the wheels
turning. You will notice something that gives before the wheels turn.
This is what is worn. It quite possibly is the tierods in addition to
other things as well. In a tight system, nothing should be loose at
all.
