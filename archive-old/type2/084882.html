&gt;Bob,
&gt;But dammit, scuse my french....  the point to me here is that
&gt;the guy should be able to take a vw hubcap and turn it in to a clock and
&gt;sell it.
&gt;
&gt;Not knuckle under and die cause some lawyer says he should.
&gt;Especially if the  &quot;fair use&quot; stuff works in this case.
&gt;
&gt;The one thing about this is that we don't know how Brian advertised his
&gt;creations, but I can't imagine him saying &quot;official&quot; vw clock.
=====================&gt;
Let's presume that Brian did not call his creations &quot;official&quot; VW clocks, 
'cuz, to my mind, we all know to not do same.
(Maybe illogical logic here)

but,
Boy, I'll tell 'ya Dave........
You and I sure agree on this one right down to the crossed t and legalese 
comma spliced sentence structure.

This lawyer is just after an easy fast buck being made off of another 
person's insecurities.

BTW,
I've got a VW hubcap that was made into a clock. It hangs on the wall out 
by the pool.
VW hubcap ..... I dunno; maybe.
It has a logo on it. It was mounted on a VW's tire once upon a time.
Clock ..... Yes
Is it a VW clock ...... No
