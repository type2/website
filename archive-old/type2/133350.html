&gt; This past weekend was the test run for the Westfakia's FI conversion.
&gt; The run from Toronto to Bobcaygeon was uneventful, but the performance
&gt; was... um... not so good.

&gt; The results were INCREDIBLE.  Powerband is excellent. I got my wife to
&gt; take it around the block, and she was much impressed. *This* is the bus
&gt; I have wanted to drive for over a year now.

isn't it amazing, when the FI is right the 2liter FI engine is fantastic.
(for a bus engine)

&gt; Now I'm off to pick up a replacement for the misplaced power brake
&gt; booster line. It'll be nice to be able to stop as well as the bus will
&gt; go.

stopping is a good thing

glad you got it right, there for a bit I was a tad worried for you

Bob
