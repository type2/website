&gt; Wondering if the ECU's from late model busses can be interchanged

Maybe, maybe not.  I am not an expert on parts interchange but I do know
that the '80 Cal ECU has the resistor pack for the injectors built into
the ECU and I believe the '79 and '81 Cal ECU's do as well and has a very
different wiring on the double relay so it would probably not work.  Late
'76 through '78 will probably interchange but no guarantees.  The fed
models for '79 through 82 will also probably interchange.  The '75 and
early '76 will definitely NOT interchange.

OOK
