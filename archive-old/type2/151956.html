&gt; Ignition: see if the coil will put out a spark to the head of one of the
&gt; shroud screws. You need to hold the coil wire with insulated pliers
&gt; and/or a rag or rubber glove so you don't get shocked. Pull the coil
&gt; wire off the distributor and hold it near a screw head (1/16&quot;) and have
&gt; a friend crank the engine. Get a nice fat blue spark? Good, ignition is
&gt; good though it could be timed all wrong (distributor clamp slipped). No
&gt; spark? That electronic ignition module is dead. Not uncommon. If it is a
&gt; Pertronix you've got to match the coil with the unit. If the previous
&gt; owner did not it causes an early death for the unit. The coils I have
&gt; worked with slowly degrade and never suddenly fail. The electronic
&gt; ignition modules do suddenly die.

so what coil goes with a pertronix (78 FI, auto) I've had one in my bus
for several years but never changed the coil, nothing said anything about
having to match a coil....maybe my coil is dying??? and I don't know it??
