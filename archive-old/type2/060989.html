Subject: German gas smells

Several people have asked me about this lately so here it is for everyone.

I drive a '78 VW bus with F/I but I think it applies to everyone. I had the
strong smell of raw gas in my bus when it was full of gas and when it got
driven hard climbing the mountains causing the gas to slosh about in the
tank and leaked from the cracked rubber hoses in the filler neck and in the
tank venting system. 

To put it simply, fix it now of face a burnt ride. It's much easier and
quicker ($$$) to fix that leaky, rotten rubber hose than restore a burned
carcass (or face injured family or friends in case of a sudden vehicle fire). 

Personally I was shocked to discover how bad my own hoses were! They had
cracks all the way through the hose far from the ends.

On the bus there are short rubber lines at every joint on the venting
system and some are hidden behind the bulkhead panel between the engine and
gas tank. The lines most commonly replaced are the ones in plain sight - on
the fuel 'ring' - the circle made by the lines running from the tank,
through the filter, pump, past the injectors, through the fuel pressure
regulator, and back to the tank. These are all lines that supply the
injectors with fuel. Their health and condition are critical because you
face a pressurized stream of gas dousing your running engine as you drive
down the road if one splits suddenly. 

There are many forgotten hoses that live above the engine compartment door
and behind the gas tank bulkhead. There are short lines where the vent
system runs off of one side of the gas tank, back to the air scoops in the
body, around to the other side (above the engine compartment door) and back
to the tank. There is a three way connection above the engine compartment
door on the pass side. That runs to the vacuum system to add whatever over
flow to the engine so your nose doesn't smell gas every time you swerve or
climb a hill with a full tank. 

There are another couple of rubber connections in the filler pipe. One is
at the top near the gas cap - allowing the filler pipe to make a 90 degree
turn. You can't see them. I had to pull the computer, the round pie pan
cover near the computer, the bulkhead and the gas tank to remove the filler
neck. I have heard that putting the gas nozzle of your favorite gas station
into the hole too roughly will rip these rubber parts especially if yours
is 20 years old.

At the base of the filler pipe is an almost straight section which connects
the filler pipe to the gas tank which was rotted out on my bus badly. I
replaced it with a generic hose I bought at an old FLAPS. Buy the best
quality you can find as they will most commonly be made for use in cooling
systems of big trucks and you are subjecting it to fuel. I have been told
by many people that this is the typical material to use when repairing this
part of the fuel system so I don't expect troubles but I will be checking
it again in about a year. My replacement hose wasn't just smooth rubber but
included a stranded hose foundation with rubber formed over that. 

Most of these hose connections come from the factory without hose clamps.
Unless you feel lucky, I would not pass on the opportunity to buy about $5
of clamps and seal your fuel system carefully. I did not clamp the vent
hose but I believe the other hoses must be clamped. Why take chances?

I bought my small lines from a FLAPS. I bought the large almost straight
section of hose that connects the filler pipe to the gas tank also at an
old FLAPS. The 90 bend at the top of the gas filler neck just inside the
gas cap I bought from RMMW for $35, VW didn't sell this item anymore - they
said it was obsolete. The clamps were replaced from a FLAPS too. 

Don't scrimp or try to seal split or broken lines with silicone or
something like this. No tape or tin, or any other homemade fix will suffice
here. New rubber, and clamps. And make sure the new hoses will slide on the
connections with a snug fit first, oversize hoses clamped to a size smaller
than they were designed for will crack the new hoses in a quick time. 

Consider it this way - $50 for the health of your bus (and your family) or
going cheap and spending $5 for a chance of burning it down. We are not
discussing loose ashtrays here!! It's your bus, your decision!

I didn't enjoy pulling the gas tank so I'd hate to pull it again anytime
soon so do it right the first time

Write if you have any questions.

Hope all of you have a great turkey day!!! (or whatever you choose to feast
on!)
