Subject: door seal

I had my bus out today to do a little work on the door panels when it 
started to rain outside and I noticed that water was running (with 
the door closed) down the inside of the the door. I figure that the 
door needs a new seal but Im not sure when one I need to stop this 
problem. Right now I cant afford the whole door seal package, does 
anyone know a quick fix for this problem?

thanks.
todd.
