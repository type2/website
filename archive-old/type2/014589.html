I've sorta been on both sides of the fence.  After 20 years of splitties I
broke down an bought a baywindow, and about 3 years ago I broke down and
bought an 83' Vanagon Westie (still an air sucker).  The Vanagon was nice, I
liked the defrost and the camper layout.  Thou I really didn't have a need for
the stove and sink, I still liked the storage and the rotating front seats.
It was an okay rig but it just wasn't me.  So I bailed out of it, at rather a
handsome profit!  I plan to hold on to my 69' Rivera camper, it seems to fit
my camping style better and is cheaper and easier to maintain.  A couple of
summers ago I had to replace a clutch disc at a campground.  I a little under
an hour the bus was ready to roll again.  The Vanagon would have been a lot
more work even thou you can drop the transaxle and still leave the engine in.
Being more familiar with the Bay Windows seem to play a big part in it for me.
The other thing is parts, cheaper and easier to find.  I like that.
   Peace, Love, and I must admit thou that I do miss those brakes!
