Just checked the stats (thanks Joel) and found 14 '80 Vanagons on the 
Type2 list and 12 on the Vanagon list (probably most are double 
dippers).  Just for yucks, what are your VIN numbers?
I checked the archives to find that we are in no-bus land,
not a *real* Vanagon VIN, and not properly coded to be a loaf VIN.
My VIN's are 25A0021024 and 25A0007484.
BTW according to the loaf VIN numbers there shouldn't be an
&quot;A&quot; where it is, but . . . if it's an '80, chart extrapolation from 
the Vanagon VIN says it should be.

BTW when did VW start installing the black plastic insert in the vent 
opening at the top rear sides?
