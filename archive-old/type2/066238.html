&gt;It this ain't a rescue, then I'll go soak my head in a bucket of suds.

Well, okay. But you guys are really torturing the metaphor. ;) You search &amp;
rescue somebody when that somebody is lost and in danger. There's a
difference between &quot;Search &amp; Rescue&quot; and &quot;Acquisition &amp; Development&quot;. ;)

Which is not to say that it is not a very noble thing to put a bay-window
crew back on the road if it has been loafing. And I think a bus could not
have a cooler home than Palmer's. So there. ;)
