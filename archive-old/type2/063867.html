hi
&gt; 
&gt; cant understand what yr #2 zoobie is.

i think RVB is referring to the small &quot;female&quot; brass &quot;catch&quot; 
that sits behind the fold out table. it catches on the back 
of the table (there is a &quot;male&quot; thing it grabs ;) and keeps 
the table from flopping around/rattling while  you are 
driving.

ah-  i heard of one, in a mythical tale.   wasn't there some in that pile of
VWs that Tom told Bob Hufford about?


i just got the green canvas thing this weekend that goes 
over the end of the pre' 1968 cot poles while it is being 
stored. How hard are these two find? How does it install, 
believe it or not I am interested :)

didn't know such a thing existed.    funny thing about the splittie so 42s is
that the kiddie cot was an OPTION, not Standard, as in the 68+ so 42s.  so it
i a lot harder to find the cot.  Cost an extra 35 DM in 67 to get one.   but,
i am not a camper expert.  ill try to remember to ask net tim i see a camper
freak.

BTW Clara what NOS part did Mr. Lukey find?

i think it was a water pump part.
