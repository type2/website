Subject: [T2] Ignition Switch Tricks

OK:

I received no replies, so I'll repost my question.  (archives  were not
informative)


'79 bus.  I'm trying to replace my ignition switch, and I cannot figure out
how to get the top plastic trim piece off of the ignition column.  I have
it loose from the bottom piece all the way around the steering column, but
it is hung up right around the ignition switch itself.  There must be some
kind of trick here.  Please help me avoid breaking the thing into pieces in
order to get it off.
