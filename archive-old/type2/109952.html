Subject: Re: [T2] short in our bus

If you use an ohm meter you risk the chance of blowing up the meter

If you use an ampmeter, you risk the chance of blowing up the meter

If you look for a spark near a freshly charged battery, you risk blowing
up the battery

If you use a voltmeter,, the better, high impedance meters can lead you
into thinking you have a load,

You can do it with a low impedance meter, as Jeff Myer wrote
http://www.type2_dot_com/~type2reflect/msg71056.html


I suggest you use a TEST light, remove the neg cable from the battery,,,
and put the test light between the cable and the battery terminal
BRIGHT light.... heavy load,, or a short
Dim light,, low load, radio memory or the door is open and the interior
light is on,, close the door.. unplug the radio

If the test light illuminates at all,, remove the fuses one by one,,
making sure that interior light is NOT on! and check that the test light
goes out... then you have found the load, short

then check the stereo connection, 9 out of 10 times, the culprit is
something you just installed,, like a stereo...

Do what NAPA suggested,, connect a voltmeter to the battery.. make sure
you have 12v ,,,if not, charge the battery,, start the bus,, watch the
meter, it should increase to 12.5 ,, 13... 14... then about 14.4 to 15
volts it should stop increasing,, and not exceed 15 volts

This will tell you that the charging system is working


 assuming it is NOT a short... I recently bought a 1973 Honda motorcycle,,
all I know about it, new condition, 1500 miles on the clock, 5 reciepts
tucked under the seat,, for NEW batteries every 2 months....


HUH,, how can a bike go thru 5 batteries in 1500 miles.......   turned
out, the main cable from the alternator was not connected to the
battery....

The fully charged battery would run the bike for a few miles, then die,,
put in a new one,, and all is fine again.... There was never a bad
battery,, or a short.... it was not charging the battery!

I have seen this in a bus also, not quite 5 batteries worth.. but when it
wouldn't start, the owner got futzing around with the starter,, then
didn't connect all the wires to the starter, left the alt wire off... now
he knows the starter is fine, but the battery *must* be pooched....

sorry, it was just a disconnected wire

It is suprizing how many batteries *they* check and condemn,, that once
they are charged again pass the test for ,,hmmm about 9 years in my Astro
van,, and about 6 years in my Westfalia, and about 4 years in my
tractor... I love getting &quot;scrap&quot; batteries like that... my kind of price!

&gt;  so
&gt; my question is how to find shorts. Someone at NAPA said to hook up a volt
&gt; gauge between either the + or - they could'nt remember which one and if
&gt; everything is off and it shows voltage then somewhere there is a drain.


TR Gesell wrote:
&gt;   However, anything larger than that could fry a VOM that's
&gt; designed to measure 300 mA max. If you suspect a larger drain, be careful
&gt; with your meter, or buy one that's designed to measure different amounts of
&gt; current.

&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; ---When you remove the ground cable and then go to put
&gt; it back on... are you seeing a small spark jump? If so
&gt; then there is to much current being drawn. Is
&gt; everything turned off? If you have a aftermarket
&gt; radio/cd player it will draw current to keep the
&gt; memory active.. but very little..
