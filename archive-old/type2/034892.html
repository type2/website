&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I have a spare ECU that has recently been partially submerged in water.
&gt; I am currently drying it off at ambient conditions.
&gt; Are there any products that readily drive off moisture and prevent
&gt; corrosion that will not damage a circuit board??
&gt; thanks

  In the navy we used alcohol do displace the water and it would then
dry without a residue.  It worked on a tv ckt board that had water
poured on it.  It was clean tap water and the tv was off so there was
little chance of damage to begin with.
