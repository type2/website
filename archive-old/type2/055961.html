Subject: Re: VDO Gauge &quot;Spin-Lok&quot; System

Thinking of mounting VDO gauges in the spot where the radio goes,
using a piece of nice walnut in my '78 Westy.  Question:  For the
Oil Pressure gauge, where does the sender go in.  Sorry if this
is a dumb question.  Just getting started and need all the help I
can get.
