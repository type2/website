&gt;check the color of the plugs.

what plugs the spark plugs or the Temp. plugs I have read about? Where are 
they located?

&gt;What kind of fuel setup do you have? Dual carb? Single Carb?

It is a single Weber. No Vacuum though. One main hose of the the intake 
manifold I assume it goes to the tranny, but have not gone that far yet. 
This is the first 2.0L that I have ever played with.

To All Volks:

Is it better to have a Vac. Advance or Centrifugal? I am not sure what is in 
there right now but it could be a 009. I have some spares and would like to 
know the number for the correct distributor.
That would be for a '77 FI Automatic Trans.(currently it is the Single 
Weber). Will the proper one work with both applications FI and Carbureted
