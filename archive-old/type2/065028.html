Subject: REVENGE!!! (WAS: Phooey on HOT VW's!!!)

Here's an idea....why not get the responses to &quot;Phooey on Hot VWs&quot; from the 
archive and print them up. There have to be at least 20 or so, right. Then 
write a nice cover letter politely stating what the type2/vanagon lists are 
about, and how much NEGATIVE traffic their refusal to print your article 
generated, and how their reputation really sucks with this group....

Wait a minute...this may not work. The demographics of this group (moderate 
to high income, age mid twenties and up, education attainment college and 
up) are NOT the same demographics of their target audience...mastibatory, 
zit-faced motorhead-wannabees with mamalian fixations and 
a 3rd grade reading level.

In the words of Emily Latella....&quot;Nevermind.&quot;
