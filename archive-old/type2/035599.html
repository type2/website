&gt;&gt;.... you can tell if it is a 914 longblock if it has 3 bolt intakes
&gt;(914) or 4-bolt intakes (bus/411).
&gt;
&gt;4 bolt intakes.  dang.  My dreams of speed shot to ribbons.  8-(   Ah,
&gt;well.....
&gt;

Actually that only goes for 2.0 914 heads, the 1700 engine was pretty much
identical on everything you see outside, different pistons, windage tray, and
oil filler and dipstick location would characterize it from a Bus 1700 but not
from a 411/412 really.
