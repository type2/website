I removed the windshield on my 71Westy. The whole portion of metal that was
covered by the rubber is rusted beyond repair. I want to replace this
portion but haven't been able to find a source for this replacement
panel(Not the whole nose, just the portion from the &quot;bulge&quot; up). Does
anybody knows of a source? Any suggestions, tips on how to  this project?  I
will to hear from people who has done this repair. Best regards

Victor

Hello Victor. You are talking about a very complex set of surfaces and 
curves. I do simple body work and car painting  and have worked at it for 
50 years, but only as an amateur and only on my own cars and trucks. The 
job you describe was beyond my abilities, so I hired a professional body 
man to remove my bus windshield and build me a &quot;bulge-up&quot; replacement. Took 
him two weeks and cost me $300. I felt that it was a bargain. 1That was 3 
years ago. It saved my bus.

He cut out all the rusted metal and installed brass strips and a brass 
screen of stiff wire, which he brazed in place. This gave him a porous and 
supportive non-rusting foundation on which he troweled lots of epoxy 
material that cured into a solid mass. He then used power tools to grind 
down the mass so that it resembled the original rusted metal. He did this 
in stages, building and grinding until he had reproduced the original 
surfaces. I think he used some templates to shape the epoxy while it was 
still malleable. Then he primed it and put in a new seal and windshield.

It hasn't rusted and has saved my bus.  Perhaps this gives you some ideas.
