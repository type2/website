&gt;&gt;I am trying to get some heat out of my '78 bus.  Could anyone provide me
&gt;&gt;with a diagram to show me exactly what components are in the heating
&gt;&gt;system and how they fit together.  What is I believe is the heater
&gt;&gt;control flap has three outlets.  One of these has a piece of old hose on
&gt;&gt;it but I don't know where it is supposed to connect.

&gt;Those third outlets should connect to a couple of &quot;tailpipes&quot; which carry
&gt;some heat away from the engine area when the heater is off.  If they
&gt;aren't there, it's not life or death, but they would keep your engine a
&gt;little cooler, especially when driving slow or ideling. 

The heater flap boxes have three points of hose attachment: one is hot 
air in from the heat exchangers. One is hot air forward to the heater 
vents when you pull the lever on the dashboard. And one is hot air down 
and out, either directly (if the extra hoses are disconnected) or else 
several feet aft and outboard (if the original aluminized paper hoses and 
tailpipe-like things are connected).

On a 1979 Westfalia, I went to the trouble to replace the aluminized paper
hoses that attach to the control flap housing and to reattach the exhaust
pipe-like things that run on either side of the engine, just outside of
the valve covers. I noticed no substantial change in oil temperature (I
lived in San Diego and it was summer). And those %^&amp;*!! pipes were in the
way every time I wanted to get to the valve covers. Kind of in the way for
adjusting rear brakes too. And I've not seen them intact on ANY other late
'70's Westy I've ever inspected (which numbers in the several dozens at
least). When I bought my current ride (a 1978) there were impromptu coke
can plugs wedged into the heater flaps box to plug up the airstream from
there. I removed those and just left 'em unconnected and naked. 

A pretty good VW mechanic (in Santa Barbara, CA where we experience mild 
weather) told me it's important not to plug those air passages because 
exhaust heat would build up and damage the aluminum heat exchangers if 
there were not a constant airflow over them. He also said  he thinks it 
makes no difference in keeping your bus cool whether the hot air spills 
outboard and just in front of the engine (if the tubes are disconnected) 
or several feet aft of that (if the tubes are connected). 

I would fix every single other thing on my bus before I bothered to 
replace these tubes. My advice is don't worry about them. 

Drive safely,
