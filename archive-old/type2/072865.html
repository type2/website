man, there must be a critical mass of newbies - reach it, and oil and tire
threads go off like neutron bombs!!!!

as i recall, a consensus of List Elders (who may or may not be right, but
who's busses run :)  ) was that

1. no-one has any HARD data on whether synthetic or 'natural' oils &quot;cool&quot;
or  &quot;lube&quot;  better ... we have had MANY discussions on heatsinking, flow or
radiative rates, etcetcetc. they both seem to do just fine.

2. oil will actually go 3000-5000 miles these days, but you are supposed to
change the oil in a vw every 1500-2000 miles depending on use - and this is
important -
not because you 'use up' the oil (tho that happens), but BECAUSE WATER AND
ACIDS IN THE OILPAN  WILL EAT YOUR CASE FROM THE INSIDE OUT!!!!!  this is
&gt;from 3 different vw factory-trained mechs in my area.  and no, it doesn't
apply to the type4 aluminum folks. you folks get more options!

3. having said that, synthetics are costly in comparison to dinosaur oils.
you would save a coupla bucks by NOT throwing out used synthetic oil every
1500 or so miles.

4. multi-weight oils are a blend. when you heat them, the volitaile stuff
cooks off, leaving you with basically a single-grade oil anyways. unless
you drive up mountains on a regular basis (hot at bottom, snow at top sort
of stuff), yer prolly better off running a single weight appropriate for
each season in your area, as you won't really NEED an oil that will 'go
&gt;from 20F to 80F.'  change when it becomes mainly cold, and again in summer.
and use whatever tickles yer fancy - natch or syn. just don't use wesson!

don't pmail me about any of this - i kinda don't care :)   but pointing the
lists to faqs and informative pages around the net might be a good thing.
we can all read, and decide.

i think a REALLY good idea would be a webpage in the archives combining as
many of these threads (in sum) as possible, links to whatever pages back up
each theory or product, etcetec. do one for oil and one for tires. SEND THE
ADDRESSES TO EACH NEW SIGNEE, and we old fogies should check them as well -
never know when you might change your mind!

and no, i am not volunteering. i am currently rebuilding 2 cases and moving
a shop... plus, i suck at webpage design :)
