&gt; &gt; I doubt this would be the problem, because the coil simply provides juice to
&gt; &gt; the backup lights.  Good call on a possible problem though.  If the backup
&gt; &gt; light wire is grounded somewhere, then that would be a problem.
&gt;
&gt; No, I think this is *exactly* the problem. The backup light circuit is coil,
&gt; backup light switch (on the transmission), fuse, light bulbs, ground. Hook
&gt; the backup light switch to the negative side of the coil, and when you shift
&gt; into reverse it grounds the coil and your engine dies.
&gt;
&gt; Switch the backup light wire from the two-prong connector on the coil (the
&gt; negative side; one prong's for the condenser, the other for the dwell/tach)
&gt; to the three-prong side and your Bus will work fine.

good point.  I was thinking short, but simply hooking the wire to the
wrong side of the coil will do the same thing.  Replacement coils seem to
have three prongs on both sides, which adds to the confusion.
