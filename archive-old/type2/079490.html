Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

Before anyone spends a lot of time designing and building such a 
system, I'd recommend figuring out if there will really be enough 
heat available.  With my bus, it's difficult to keep the oil temp 
above 180 in the winter, even with working flaps.  My guess is 
that the heat coming off of the oil cooler won't do squat to warm 
the interior in the winter.  It would only work well in the summer 
when you don't need the heat.   And before someone asks why it 
works with a dump truck, I'll remind them that a) the cab of a 
truck is much smaller than a bus interior, and b) the engine is 
probably 5 times as large as a bus engine.  My personal opinion is 
that for any heater to work directly from a bus engine, it will 
have to be fed by the exhaust waste heat, or the waste heat from 
the cylinders (now there's an idea - lots of clean, hot air!).

&gt;&gt; I have simpler solution to the interior heat---
&gt;&gt; Use an oil cooler with a fan behind it to create BTU's in the 
cabin.
