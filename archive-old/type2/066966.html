Subject: Demise of the Syncro Westie Page

My new ISP, Mindspring, just summarily dumped all my web pages, which, besides
the Syncro and Westfalia material, also had some aircooled  stuff,
including coverage of my '64 Standard. I'm POd!

I'll be moving the stuff shortly to www.off-road_dot_com, which at least
has some interest in seeing the pages are cared for. Details as they
develop.

Tom F.
