I also noticed that my (original?) bumper bolts were an odd size. They were an
M10 thread (x 1.5), but had a 15mm(?) AF head, rather than 17mm AF which would
be more usual. ISTR that they also had a vee out of the first part of the
thread, like they were supposed to have some thread-cutting ability. Several
were replaced with 'normal' M10 bolts (There's enough room to get a 17mm AF
socket in).

&gt;Just a note - the bolts are not 17mm bolts because they use a 17mm socket
&gt;on the hex (17mm hex).  If they are approximately 3/8&quot; then they are M10
&gt;(10mm dia.) bolts.
