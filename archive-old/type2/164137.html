Subject: Fwd: [T2] Hard Starting Saga Solved

Re the points: I just finished a long exercise with a stock 1600 and 
SVAD. It would not start.

I began tracing the spark and found none at the secondary of the coil.

I then turned the ignition switch on, put a voltmeter on the green 
wire that leads from the secondary to the points,  and rotated the 
pulley. As the points opened and closed, I expected to see the 
voltage at the green wire go from 12V to 0V. No such luck. The 
voltage always read a few volts. I pulled the distributor and put an 
ohmmeter from the green wire to ground. The &quot;arm&quot; of the points was a 
near dead short to ground  -  even with the points open!! This was a 
new set that came in a brand new distributor that I bought.

I spent a long time with a magnifying glass trying to find the short. 
I eventually gave up, stuck in another set of points, and every 
resistance and voltage measurement was normal. The engine started 
right up and ran.

Another lesson learned in my garage. Another check to make before 
installing any new electrical thingy.

Jack
