I'm never short of amazed at the help I can find. 
Good to see that.  As for the parts I am looking for: 

     First and foremost I would love to find a rear
bumper for my 72 westie.  Other minor things are a
passenger side rear view mirror, and a passenger side
sun visor for the same bus.
     Back in 92 or 3 when I bought her, the pump for
the faucet in the sink worked just fine.  The last
time that I tried, the actual tube that water flows
out of fell off and of course the thing doesn't move
any water.  I'd love to get this fixed also.
     I would also like to note for anybody who is
interested, I just replaced the old motor(1800 dual
port, dual solex motor to part out).  I replaced it,
because I had lost compression on two cylinders.  I am
most interested in seeing these old parts go to get
somebody elses machine healthy again.  

keep em rolling
