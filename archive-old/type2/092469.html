Subject: Re: [T2] please id vehicle in back ground

Good Call!!   The pics supposedly date from 1979.  Took the not american 
as a clue point for a search. Turns out that  Kirkstown is a track in UK 
and a closer look at the vehicles in this pic and others say that there 
wasnt a single non euro vehicle in the pictures.
