&gt; Question: I know that Muir's book says to label everything you pull
off --
&gt; but with what kind of tape???  Between grease and dirt, everything
I've
&gt; tried just falls off.

I use 1 inch masking tape.  Don't try to stick it to the parts, just
wrap it around and stick it to itself.  I use a &quot;sharpie&quot; marker as it
is quite indelible.  Small parts go into small plastic bags which are
closed with the masking tape.

  The main thing that terrifies me about doing this is
&gt; the prospect of not being able to piece it together again.

Label things and make diagrams as you go.  There aren't that many
connections, but it only takes one bad one to waste an hour (or a
month!) trying to fix.

&gt; I know it's a
&gt; silly thing, but I'm really curious.  Do you gurus just *know* what
hooks up
&gt; where?  

I suppose if you do it for a living, but us normal folk have to make
cheat-sheets.

Or do you have some special super-sticky tape?  Or is my engine
&gt; compartment just unconscionably filthy?

Do yourself a favor if you can and take the bus to the
spray-it-yourself car wash and clean the engine bay and underside as
best you can.  Any grunge you knock off is grunge you won't have to
deal with on the bench.
