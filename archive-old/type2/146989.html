not affiliated with seller, saw it on the pelican forum.

Bus content. the '70 Westy sits butt high in the garage with the rear 
bearing housings off.  rear brake overhaul, shoes delaminating, springs 
missing, etc., etc. . .  Going to finally replace the &quot;diagonal arm&quot;/ 
&quot;swing arm&quot; bushings in an attempt to get my rear camber better.  Might 
as well reset the torsion bars while I'm in there.  replacing 1 side 
rear bearings.  ordered a bunch of parts from BusDepot, Bus-Boys, and 
the local VWFLAPS: springs, brake hoses, cyls, the bushings (1 pr in 
urethane--do the beetle IRS diagonal arm bushings fit? about to find 
out. . .) .  might have to work this weekend doing some stream 
sampling.  at any rate, when I get to that part--is there anyone in the 
Atlanta area who could help me bleed the brakes?  I don't seem to know 
anyone around here who is willing to come by and help.  glad I'm moving 
to Asheville next month where a lot of those nice FMBC folks live. 
although I will miss my garage this winter!
