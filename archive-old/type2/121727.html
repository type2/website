&lt;&lt; I have seen posts referencing &quot;lucky people with 356 engines&quot;, and I'm 
trying to figure out just how lucky these folks are :-)

TIA.

You might spread the word on that engine to 356 Porsche people (some-
one should be able to direct you...) The money you could get out of a 
Porsche owner for that engine (even &quot;as is&quot;) might be better spent on
