Here's the tally, if anyone is interested.

On my running route:

Two perfect white '71 Westys, one with white cotton curtains that I 
called &quot;the wedding bus&quot; because it had a sign that said &quot;just married&quot; 
when it first appeared.

A green and white '70 hardtop westy.

A dirt brown aircooled vanagon westy.

A dark blue and light blue aircooled vanagon.

Two gold waterboxer westys. 

A white 68-69 bus belonging to a chiropractor with a spine painted on the 
sides of the bus.

A blue and white '71 that was parked on the street with a flat tire for a 
couple of months.

A dingy white bus with an early westy roof rack, but no poptop.

A Champagne Edition bus over which a checkerboard had been painted.


On my route to work:

Several buses in the parking lot of the VA hospital, beaters all.

A custom-painted cream-colored bus with a brown stripe. 

Several surfers.

Another air-cooled vanagon westy.

A really nice gold westy with a straw hat that was usually on the kitchen 
countertop.

A Westy eurovan that had the furniture removed and was filled with scrap 
wood from some project.

A 1975 robin's egg blue and white westy. 

A '77 green Westy usually parked in front of Macy's at the mall.

A couple of Splitty westies, one nice and the other beat to death.

There may have been others, but it has been a while and I have forgotten.
