&gt;i use the red atv lift for dropping vw engines and it does make the job
&gt;very easy.  the only modification needed is to put a board over the 2 lift
&gt;sections as on a t1 motor if you don't it will bend up the tin.  i had a
&gt;rather easy time droppign and replacing the t4 motor and tranny together
&gt;with it also all by myself.

&gt;I was notified by email from harbor freight of an ATV/motorcycle lift that
&gt;was on sale for $59 today
&gt;http://www.harborfreightusa_dot_com/displayitem_retail.taf?Itemnumber=02792
&gt;
&gt;It looks like it is custom made to drop VW engines. Has anyone ever tried
&gt;to use one of these things?
