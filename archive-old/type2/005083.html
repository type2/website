Paul just did it on my '70 as it also flamed up.  Order PN 311905865A (check
that) from your favorite place $30.  Then you got to get the column off
(best to pull the whole thing, remove wheel, remove instrument panel and
fold it up out of way quick (leave all the wires attached just twist off the
speedo) so you can easily disconnect the wires for the signal and the
ignition, remove the 4 screws attaching the switch housing to the collapsing
support mount under the dash, pull the 2 screws at the cover on the bottom
of colum, disconnect the signals physically, make sure the key is on and
turn lock is not out engaged, and the whole thing should fold back toward
the seat then lift right up out of the car,  disconnect the horn as
required, ( I may be forgetting something, but follow your wits) not as bad
as it seems about 1 hour out and one in, got to keep all the signal wires
straight  but they are color coded, and you need a wheel puller, but not
involved, just keeping things straight) with it out you look at the ignition
switch body and will see a tiny screw head halfway on the body covered in
red paint, remove it.  Then the electrical half of the switch pivots right
out, you fish out the mess of charred wires, and hope the body of the switch
housing wasn't to messed up in the flameup.  The new switch goes in pretty
obviously, you replace the screw with a dab of paint, put it all back in.
At the time a new steering coupler might not come amiss as you can see it.
I think prior to '70 you can turn and tilt the switch housing for acess in
the car easily without pulling the column but I recall on a '70 the whole
pull is probably easiest and lets you look at that steering coupler anyway,
and it surely needs replaced.
