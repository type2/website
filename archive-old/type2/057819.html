&gt; gear and I absolutely couldn't slide the stickshift into position.  It was
&gt; like something was blocking the linkage.  I couldn't get into any other
&gt; gear either.

&gt; This morning I got right into gear, but I'm still worried.

Since it's a Vanagon the clutch is controlled by a hydraulic system. It is
using brake fluid drawn from your brake circuit so check the brake fluid
level under the instrument panel cover.

I had a similar problem. Turned out to be a leaky command cylinder (the one
attached to the clutch pedal). Another symptom was that the clutch had to
depressed further than before to get it free.
