Subject: Re: [T2] Winshield Wiper Hose on '78 

&gt; I'm new to the list and hope someone has had a similar problem.
&gt; 
&gt; When I try to wash the windshield, I end up with washer fluid on my shoe.  
&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to change/replace the hose.
&gt; 
Arvid,
It's a pain in the butt but not too difficult.  The VW washer system works
as you know on air pressure in the reservoir tank.  The control is a valve
that is contained in the wiper switch on the steering column.  

So there is a hose that runs from the bottom of the washer tank up into
the steering column and to the valve on the wiper switch.  Then there is
another hose running from the valve back out of the steering column to the
nozzles on the front of the Bus.

You really don't want to replace more of the hose than you really have to,
so pinpoint where the leak is coming from.  If all the hose looks pretty
bad though, then go ahead and replace it.

To get to the hose in the steering column, remove the steering wheel (mark
its position relative to the steering column before removal).  Pop out the
horn button, disconnect the wire and then unscrew the nut that holds the
steering wheel on.  Then it just pulls off.

Now you are looking at the top of the turn signal switch in the steering
column.  Look up under the steering column and find the 2 black plastic
electrical plugs going into the column and undo them.

Go back up top and undo the 4 screws that hold the turn signal switch in.
Once you remove those, the turn signal switch and wiper switch will come
out as a single unit.  Your mobility will be limited because of the washer
hoses still attached to the wiper switch but you should have enough room
to replace them.

BTW, BEFORE YOU REMOVE ANY WASHER HOSE FROM A FITTING please take the time
to bleed the pressure from the tank or you will get a bath.

The hoses themselves are easy.  Go to the auto parts store and buy the
correct size hose (and I'd also buy some of those plastic hose connectors
too).  Just run the hose along the route the old hose takes.  The fittings
at the washer switch and at the nozzles are just slip on fittings.  The
fitting at the tank is a weird deal with a threaded plastic cap on the
hose that threads onto the fitting on the tank.  Therefore, if you are
replacing this section, cut the old hose somewhere along its route and
splice the new hose in with one of the hose connectors.  I haven't yet
found a good way to make new hose work with that tank fitting.

It also might be a good idea to disconnect the battery before you start
this work due to the liklihood of spilling lots of liquid under the dash.

Some will say to just install a standard electric washer pump inline with
the hose somewhere and install a switch to control it.  That works well
enough, but won't solve your leak.  I have found the original VW system
works just fine so don't really recommend you change it.  Only thing you
have to do is remember to keep it pressurized, but since you are a
responsible car owner you check your tire pressures when you fill up for
gas so you can top off the tank then, right? :-)

If the hose is OK the system holds pressure well.  Just don't
overpressurize it :-)  Also, if travelling at high altitudes (like Rocky
Mountain altitudes), you might want to bleed the tank down a little as
the hoses tend to burst in that situation due to the lower atmospheric
pressure.  Happened to my dad in his '68 Beetle travelling through the
Rockies :-)

Anyway, once you're done it all goes back together the same way it came
apart.
