Subject: 911 information.. pureists beware, but hey its fryday....
Message-ID: &lt;3785CFFD.14F3A1A5_at_geocities_dot_com&gt;

i was looking through some vw newsgroup somewhere and i saw a post about
a 911  in a bus there everywhere someone said he did these conversions
so i went to his websight and e-mailed him about it, he said he'd done
about a dozen of these conversions. the sight is
http://www.novatechnik_dot_com/ he'd probably but any engine in anything..
oh, it costs about 6,000 to put a 2.8 carborated engine in a bus plus
the cost of the engine. another 5k if you want it rebuild. . quite a
price to be able to pass semi's.

Disclamer.... if your vw is strickly stock please dont do this Stock
vw's are harder and harder to come by.

&quot;What year was pink &amp; teal a factory color?&quot;DUDE!&quot;,lets cut the stock
stereo hole &amp; install a killer bumpin system!Please... put down the bong
and restore it to stock.This has been a public service announcement.....
