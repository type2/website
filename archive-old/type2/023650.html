Subject: Empty shell
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

I have a 71 bus which is basically an empty shell.  I used it to fix up 
another 71 that I have.  It has no engine or trans, no dash, a cracked 
windshield, and some body damage (mainly the rear corners).  What, if 
anything, could I expect to sell this for?

Shannon
