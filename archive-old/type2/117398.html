Subject: Re: [T2] Quick Question about Steering Wheel Action

&gt; I consciously acknowledged something with my 79 bus that I had been merely

&gt; loosely (a few inches maybe?) before I feel the pull of the wheels turning.
&gt; I observed this condition while parked, and couldn't gauge it as well while
&gt; moving - although the looseness is still palpable.  This seems odd as my
&gt; steering has always been real tight after replacing the steering box a few

check to see if anything is working loose!!  especially the stuff you
changed and worked on
