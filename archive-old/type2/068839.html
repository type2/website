Subject: it's my bus, too (was bus security)

Hey wait a minute! I thought it was my bus. I'm working on restoring it
(have been for 7 months), but it's also my daily driver and I have 2 kids
and I have a job and I don't have the money for someone else to do the
resto for me. I admit that, right now, it looks like _crap_. But someday it
will look as nice as I can afford it to be, even if that means painting it
by hand and making all the interior panels myself. I like it now, and I'll
like it when it's done. I thought the VW &quot;ethos&quot;, if you will, was &quot;doing
your own thing&quot; and accepting others who don't see or do things quite the
way you do (except for singlecab monster trucks ;)). David, did you make
that sig line yourself? :-)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
&gt;&gt;deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
&gt;&gt;then why do you subscribe to this list...?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;OK,OK, enough...flame me if you must...go on!

&gt;THANK YOU!
&gt;
&gt;I feel the same way! Her Majesty is beautiful and the idea of trashing
&gt;her to make unattractive to theives is beyond me. Glad you had the guts
&gt;to post that!
