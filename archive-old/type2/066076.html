Subject: Expensive Oil Leak

Ok, I've put it off long enough.  

I took my '64 motor into the shop for a little end play adjustment.  When I
called to pick it up they said &quot;No charge!.....yur motor's shot.&quot;  Turned
out that it wasn't the end play that was out of adjustment, it was the case
- - and  my thrust bearing was what was moving in the case.

They said they wouldn't advise driving it at all - &quot;could go any time&quot; -
and they could fix it if I'd just give them my credit card number.....

Well, that was 10,000 miles ago and now its leaking quite a bit of oil out
of the front.  So maybe it's time to swap motors since the case is probably
shot.

So, any recommendations on motors?  I'm in the Bay Area (CA) and would
guess that there must be a good source around here - or is mail order the
way to go?

Thanks,
Bill Moseley
