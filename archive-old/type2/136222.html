Subject: RE: [T2] Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

&gt; Went to Costco and bought their Kirkland Load Range C tires and had no
&gt; problems after that.

I spent the summer driving and taking care of 15-passenger vans on rough
gravel roads in rural Alaska.  The vans had a variety of different brands of
tires, including Kirkland.  The Kirkland tires were by FAR the worst of all
the brands we had on our vans.  Other brands of tires died and were replaced
when their treads were worn out.  The Kirkland tires typically had to be
replaced due to tread separation, and this would take place LONG before they
should have been &quot;used up.&quot;  If one of our Kirkland tires encountered a rock
or a pothole -- a trivial event for most tires -- it would spring multiple
pinhole leaks in the area of the impact.  Often I would have to shove three or
four plugs into a single tire just to get it back on the road, and even then,
it would still need air every morning.

The only reason that these awful tires didn't present a huge safety risk due
to blowouts: our vans never exceeded 25 mph.

Maybe Kirkland tires are fine for the vast majority of drivers, who do almost
all of their driving on well-maintained pavement.  I imagine so, because there
are an awful lot of people who buy them and drive with them, and I don't hear
about them getting killed by their tires.  To me, though, they seem VERY
fragile and highly susceptible to damage from rough roads.

As someone who does a lot of driving on rough, unpaved Forest Service roads, I
would NEVER EVEN CONSIDER buying Kirkland tires for my VW Bus.
