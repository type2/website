Hi Jay,

GO FOR IT!!!!

I picked up a 79 &quot;Free to a Good Home&quot; from a list-member last year, and it
came with no motor or tranny. My wife and I towed it 700 miles home in one
weekend trip from Toronto to New Hampshire. (THANKS MATT, wherever you are!)

The motor is a simple fit, the only thing getting in the way is the bracket
the FI system is hanging from, mine was quickly dispatched with a sawz-all.

The 78 fuel tank has a dual outlet, we wound up using the 73 tank because of
a rusted elbow on the 79 tank. If you just blocked off the unneeded pipe
you'd probably be OK. For two weeks I drove it connected to a 5-gallon
outboard motor tank!  The engine tin is not going to be a problem at all.

Understand that I didn't do most of the work, I arranged a barter deal with
Dennis Joliffe acting as a courier in a separate deal between him and the
fellow with the free bus, and in turn Dennis did the motor work for me. In
my case I had a VERY rusty 73 westy and he swapped the motor and tranny
both. I spent the summer last year working on the interior, and then the
winter grafting on a pop-top. It looks awesome now, and total cost for a
clean &quot;new&quot; westy haven't been bad at all... I spent maybe $US 250 on the
motor swap. It could be done for less, but that's my approximate cost for
parts and labour..... YMMV.

Check out the website in my tagline for more info on the project.
 

Happy trails,

&gt; Subject: [T2] 73 Into 78 Engine Swap
&gt; 
&gt; After several months of lurking and reading the archives, I find myself in
&gt; need of the expertise of the list.  I have a chance to pick up a '78 Westy
&gt; Poptop for very little cash outlay less than 20 miles from home.  As far as
&gt; I know, the '78 is solid and has a comeplete interior, but no engine.  I
&gt; currently have a '72 Hardtop with a '73 1700cc w/ dual Webbers.  I would
&gt; like to drop the'73 engine into the '78 chassis, but don't know if there
&gt; would be any issues with compatability of engine tin, tranny, gas tank
&gt; (assuming the 78 had FI) etc.  Please let me know what to expect if I decide
&gt; to undertake this project.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
