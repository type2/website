&gt;Why does the L-Jetronic fuel pressure regulator in my bus sample the air 
&gt;input manifold pressure?

I think I already answered that.

&gt;If the vacuum line to the regulator is removed and blocked would the 
&gt;engine run richer?

Yes, except under WOT conditions.

&gt;Would the vacuum drop.

No.

&gt;Is the differential pressure at the injector tip the signed sum of the air 
&gt;manifold pressure and the fuel manifold pressure?

Don't know the rate of change of fuel manifold pressure vs. that of air 
manifold pressure so I can't answer that, but due to the simplicity of the 
device, my guess is &quot;probably&quot;.

&gt;Is the differential pressure at the injector tip held constant by the fuel 
&gt;pressure regulator control loop?

No, as I have stated before it varies with manifold pressure.  Oh, you said 
differential pressure.  I'm talking about absolute fuel pressure - thinking 
about differential pressure makes my head hurt so someone else will have to 
answer that.
