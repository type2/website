Golly, I love this list! You ask a question and, if you get an answer at 
all, you get everything from Rick's 'get a more expensive bleeder' to 
Andy's 'get a kid to pump the brakes.' And every fine point on the 
gradient in between those two.

To Bill Abbott, I think: I doubt that the vacuum pump is actually 
supposed to create a vacuum anywhere (except your wallet). It just draws 
fluid into the reservoir where the air escapes and then pumps it back. 
Although the more I think about it, the more unlikely that sounds.

My MG, back in my salad days, was so small you could press your nose up to
the rear backing plate and pump the brake pedal with your hand. I got it
into my head that my bus, being a smidge bigger, might not be so
convenient. But then I remembered that it's actually possible to pull on
the brake pedal from underneath. So I guess I'll get a piece of tubing and
a jar and order coffee service and doughnuts delivered under Peregrine's
belly and have at it. 

And, okay, I'll chock a wheel. Fussy, fussy, fussy.

Mark
