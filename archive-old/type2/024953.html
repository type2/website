Gentlepersons-
                       ...Saw a lovely split-window in NYC, Saturday, 
downtown. From my per-
spective, I couldn't see the plate but it was blue and white and had &quot;Mein 
Schmerz&quot; 
painted in one corner of the cargo hatch. Anybody's? Anybody's German better 
than
mine and could translate? Oh, yeah, apologies if this translates to a 
non-pc/family/what-
ever-oriented English...
