Christopher:
You're probably partly right, but there are 4 main reasons to replace
p&amp;c's:
1. Worn ring groove lands. Put a new ring in the groove and check the
space that's left with a feeler guage. I'm a little rusty on numbers but
I think that anything more than 4 thousandths (.004) inch is too much.
2. Cylinder wall taper. To measure this it's really nice to have a bore
taper guage. They're expensive and few shops have them, so what I use is
an inside micrometer. This takes a lot of fiddling around and a lot of
&quot;feel&quot; to do a good job of determining the wear. The wear mostly will be
at the top of the ring travel, just below the ridge. Engines can
tolerate some taper (up to .010 inch) but bear in mind that this makes
the rings go in and out as the pistons go up and down their travel, and
a lot of taper is going to wear out the rings and lands pretty quickly.
3. Broken fins. The reasons for  this are obvious.
4. Good opportunity to upgrade to a larger displacement. There is a
point of diminishing returns with this plan.(George Lyle thinks it's
85.5mm, others may feel up to 90.5mm)
What it mostly boils down to is economics. If you're a shop, you just
sell the customer new parts, make the markup on them, save them the
labor charge of cleaning the old ones, and the rebuild may last 100,000
miles instead of 50,000 miles(I said may). If you have more time than
money, and the p&amp;c's meet the above specs, then go for it! Personally,
I'd rather spend a couple hours doing something more fun.
