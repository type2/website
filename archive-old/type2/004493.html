If you are talking about a thick black wire with the fuse incased in a
little plastic fuse holder this is for the back up lights and should be
connected to the 15 side of your coil. (This is the only black wire coming
from the driver's side of my 72 westy, 1700)
I will email you a pic if you need to confirm it.

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I'm finally getting around to putting the motor back in my 72 westy
&gt; (1700cc) and in doing so I have found a black wire coming from the
&gt; driver's side of firewall with a 10 amp fuse and I do not know what it
&gt; is for.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I am not sure if this is one that was connected or not when I took out
&gt; the engine.  I did not mark it so maybe it was not connected?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Craig
