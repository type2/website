And a good 2-cents it was, Jason.

Even the best of those types systems (those retailing in the $300 range)
have batteries rated in the 17 Ah range, and those costing less are
 proportionately less endowed in that area according to my research.

If a 9 Amp-hour rated battery will run a 3-amp cooler for only ~3 hours before
 going flat, the advantages of using an automotive, marine, or golf cart 
 battery rated at 75 Ah or better are clear. 

Of course, battery manufacturers have chosen to hokus-pokustize battery
 ratings rather than expose the buying public to Ah ratings, which are fuzzy
 and subject to change relative to the resistive severity of the load. This
 makes understanding the principals a tad hard for the layman typically
 intimidated by things logarithmic.

It's a question of use, then. If all you want is interior lights or things
 which normally prosper on &quot;D&quot; cells, one of the many power-booster type
 products is the answer--and every bit as handy as you say. Even for that
 quick burst needed to start an engine.

But for those wanting to watch TV, VCR, refrigerator, or charge up an electric
 scooter or other battery through an inverter, a full-sized aux battery is
 essential and unavoidable.

Your post will surely hit home with some readers--which is great. Even Rat Shack is carrying those sorts of things
 now.
I have attempted to manually adjust word-wrap this time, and invite listees
to ignore the advert beneath my sig.
