Subject: Re: lead additive (was unleaded fuel)...

Thanks Bob.  My engine was rebuilt (supposedly) about 10,000 miles ago by
the PO.  However, I have no idea whether or not hardened seats were used
or not.  My engine runs hot (perhaps totally unrelated) anyway, but
judging by the quality of work put into rebuilding the engine (very poor),
I doubt that any anti-lead precaution was used.

Leaded gas isn't available anywhere here in the states, so I've been using
various lead substitues in hopes of preventing valve damage.  But I have
no idea whether or not I'm wasting my money on the stuff or not.

Just ordered a stock exhaust from Ron Salmon (I've got some ridiculous
aftermarket thing on there now) as well as some heater boxes and poptop
seals.  Can't wait to begin the winterizing process.

Cheers,

Tom
