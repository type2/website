Subject: Bus saves Avalanch victims

Did anyone see the news about the folks on the alaskan hwy. trapped
between two avalanches?  One of the vehicles was a campervan.  The
spokesman reported that the the trapped people gathered in the campervan
and stayed warm and comfortable as they waited for rescue.  There was a
quick shot of the bus with a helicopter flying over head as the people
were rescued.  The bus had a propane heater.
