Subject: engine cutting out problem

Well after getting the bus back on the road and enjoying not having
heat (soon to be fixed :) ) I small problem has returned. Sometimes
while on the highway and usually not full throttle but a little below
the engine misses, not much, just enough to notice. On this 79 2 liter
w/ FI I have recently replace the dist cap,points,condensor,plugs &amp;
wires. The only time it seems to do it is when it has just rained or
it is quite humid. I have looked at most of the engine connections esp
the temp sensor II and everything seems tight. In the next few days i
plan on checking connections w/ multi-meter, but not there yet. 

So, anyway does these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Since I
haven't replaced the coil, I sorta suspect it. Would a coil that is on
it's last leg become more unreliable when humid? TIA
