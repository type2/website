 &gt; A kot ! That would be an interesting option !
 &gt; But where do you keep the kot when not using it ?

I think they mount on poles that simply rest next to the seats.  When
not in use, I suppose that you simply just remove it and fold/roll it up
with the poles.  Note that I have never seen one of these cots first-hand,
but I know they exist.

 &gt; What kind of space is there in the pop-top ? Is it a bed ?
 &gt; I really need to go looking for a nice T2 soon.

Yah, the pop-top is a sleeping area.  When I get a chance (perhaps tonight),
I will take some photos of my '76 Westfalia and refer them to you off-list.

 &gt; Summer is almost over here... :)

Yah, but considering how hot it is over there right now, a long drive
in a Bus might warrant waiting for cooler weather :-)  (A co-worker of
mine in Amsterdam has inverted his schedule, sleeping during the day
and working at night, claiming that it's just too hot during the day to
think :-)
