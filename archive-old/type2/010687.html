Subject: support beam remove?
Message-Id: &lt;19996117343641_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

 Listees,

Can anyone tell me if the attachment bolts under the engine on a '71 can be removed 
while the engine is in the bus? I'm thinking of removing these and jacking up the engine
slightly to give me clearance enough to put a muffler clamp on. Removing the beam from 
the body wouldn't increase the clearance at all but maybe loosening the engine from the 
support would?I got one clamp on, no problem, but, for some reason, the right one is 
further towards the front and lies right on the beam!


Thanks in advance,
Joel '71
