Subject: Re: [T2] to chrome or not to chrome my hubcaps

&gt; the other day i was noticing my original vw hub caps
&gt; were getting rusted so i decided to call a local
&gt; plating company for a quote the guy gave me a estimate
&gt; of 80.00 per hubcap. Is that a fare estimate should i
&gt; pay the over 300 to get all my hubcaps rechromed
&gt; 
&gt; 
   Regardless of price, ask to see samples of the plater's
work...&quot;Real&quot; plating is difficult...There's a shop in my
'hood that does electroplating (and serves the 36 inch
wheel and rubberband crowd...;-( but the results don't
seem to hold up...As they say on the corner used car
lot, &quot;Don't buy the paintjob...&quot;
