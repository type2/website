Make certain the base throttle adjustment is correct. If your getting most
of your air for idle by the butterfly, your mixture adjustment screw would
do as you have described. If, however, turning the idle screw has little
effect on rpm, you most certainly have a vacuum leak, if not at a worn
shaft they at any of the junctions from the carb base to the intake ports.
Use ether to prove vacuum leaks or not for sure, then confirm base
adjustment of the butterfly, float level, ect. You can try removing the
mixture screw and put a blast of air through there. Sometimes but certainly
not always will this cure your sympton. I have a number of PICT-3's sitting
around that no amount of chem-dip, flushing and air blasting could free up
the idle circuit on. In every case, the carb was probably not cleaned and
serviced in 10 years plus, or sat for a coupla years unused before I saw it.


&gt;&gt; Also,  the carb won't hold a steady idle, it lopes from about 850
&gt;&gt; to 1000 rpm's and occasionally saunters  up to 1400, 1500 rpm's.
&gt;&gt; What's up with that??  Vacumme leak?
&gt;
&gt;My suspect is a worn throttle shaft that lets air past.  
&gt;
&gt;The -2 and -3 carbs are a lot more susceptable to being dirty than the -1
&gt;versions.  A good cleaning will often cure their ills.

I concur but would replace &quot;often&quot; with &quot;sometimes&quot;, and there is no way of
knowing without a complete and thorough cleaning and adjustment, then give
it a try and see what happens. And always before futzing with fuel
delivery, verify mechanicals then ignition and timing before attempting
carb adjustments, and then rule out vacuum leaks with the simple ether test
if you haven't already.
