Subject: Re: [T2] List charter, advertising, ebay.

&gt;&gt;I'm willing to put this to a vote, OFFLIST.  If you have an opinion about
&gt;&gt;re-allowing ebay postings to the list, please email your option to
&gt;&gt;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com.  DO NOT post these to the list, nor in a reply to
&gt;&gt;this thread.
&gt;
&gt;Another possibility might be to perhaps relax the advertising 
&gt;restrictions, but split the advertising off to a third list all of its 
&gt;own. This would accommodate both the people who want eBay ads, and the 
&gt;people who want no ads at all.

The Corvair national club CORSA has started a list called vv-talk to 
compliment the main list. Anything goes on the vv-talk list except flame 
wars and anyone that tolerates chat on the main list is now generally 
subscribed to the talk list as well.

They are just as &quot;militant&quot; about Corvair stuff not being appropriate on 
the talk list as the main list is about non-Corvair stuff on the main list. 
Funny really.

Ont he talk list anything has been deemed fair game as long as it is in 
decent taste - topics so far have ranged from politics, religion, jobs, 
etc. We also ask questions about other vehicle makes and brands. No 
archives are kept.
