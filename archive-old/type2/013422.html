speaking of cleaning the case, but splitting it...

When i did the rebuild on my 74, i took the type4 case and my fatherinlaw and
i layed some 'coil cleaner' to it- the stuff used for cleaning AC condensers.
Really did the job - didn't appear to etch anything..

should i not do this to a type1 case?  I mean, i wouldn't do it to an ancient
one, but anything thats gonna go in my 71 is probably gonna be at least later
than 65. Whats the best way? 409? ;p

I would plug the holes with rags and hit it with a few cans of Berryman

&gt;engine is out with heads and cylinders off for new rings and a general
&gt;inspection... my rods and bearings seem great (no deflection on either) so i
&gt;was thinking i'd just see if i could clean the case without splitting it...
&gt;muir reccomends removing the oil strainer and pressure relief valve, then
&gt;washing the outside and inside thoroughly with degreaser and a pressure
&gt;washer... kinda nervous about this as i worry about getting bits and peices
&gt;of grit inside the case that way...
