Subject: DIY carbide tools supply

I work with an online supplier of carbide burs (alternate spelling burrs, burr, bur) and endmills.  Some people call them rotary files and they are most often used in air die grinders or dremels for head and exhaust porting and also sometimes for cleaning up welds.  Feel free to email me at bengalbus1969_at_yahoo_dot_com if you have any interest or non-list related questions about our products found at www_dot_carbidebur_dot_com .

I recently purchased a 1969 Westy (good body, not running) and a 1971 Westy (running, dangerously rusty frame).  And, thanks to this post, I can look through Type2 posts/tips at work and if the boss catches me I can show him where I'm pimping our fine USA made products.  I'm looking forward to doing as much work as possible on these projects and learning a ton in the process.
