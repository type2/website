&gt;Has anyone been to &quot;Heat, Rust and Noise in VWs by G. Matthew Bulley&quot; in
&gt;the library lately?  I would like to ref it as it had some great detailed
&gt;advice, however..... It appears to be a dead link.  If anyone could get me
&gt;a copy of it, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, list!

It disappeared but recently was kindly mirrored by a listmember:
