&gt;  You can get a Catalytic Safety heater that runs off of propane gas,
&gt;  designed for RVs and boats that will heat 1600 to 2800 BTUs designed for
&gt;  110 square feet for $240!
&gt;  

I'm sure these heaters have their place and are good for their purpose. But
the advantage of a petrol heater is that they can be used while on the move.
The use of a propane/butane (LPG) heater while on the move is quite a fire
risk and in the event of an accident a broken LPG line could shoot a jet of
LPG onto the the hot exhaust which could ignite with disastrous results.
Personally while moving I always turn the LPG off at the tank.

In the UK and probably in other parts of the world the use of a propane heater
in a moving road vehicle is illegal. It's also illegal to use any naked flame
heater in a public place e.g. a carpark or by the side of the road.
So you also need to consider your local legislation.

&gt;  - No moving parts, not even a fan
&gt;  (no jet engine sound in the middle of the night camping)

My heater is no more obtrusive than a radio. I could certainly sleep through
it although I don't use it at night as my sleeping bag which I've used in
snowcaves with blizzards outside keeps me warm enough.

Theres a word to describe a person who uses this sort heater while sleeping
and that's DEAD. A gas heater will burn the oxygen and produce Carbon Dioxide
- the Carbon Dioxide will not kill you but the lack of oxygen will.

For reasons of safety I turn the LPG off at the tank at night too.

Also burning the propane gas will produce moisture in the van every thing will
get damp - unless of course you turn the heater up to dry it out - which
produces more water - but then you can open the window to let the moisture out
- Oh dear all the heats gone too.

Just THINK even the small flame used for a propane fridge requires ventilation
holes to be cut in the van.

&gt;  - No smell
Don't know about the older petrol heaters but the new ones use separate
combustion air from that inside the van so there is no smell of burning fuel.

&gt;  - Fully adjustable
So is a petrol heater - there have been many posts to this list re the
thermostats and timers. 
Mine is thermostatically adjustable from 300W though to 2200W

&gt; - 100% safety shut-off valve
a petrol heater is stuffed with safety cut outs too.

&gt;  - you can hang it on the wall either horizontally or vertically
Again consider your local legislation - here in the UK we are only allowed ONE
section of flexible tubing between the LPG tank and the appliance usually
that's between the tank and the hard line, so (with this configuration) any
movable LPG appliance would be illegal (in UK)

&gt;  And get these dimensions - 11 3/4&quot; high, 10 1/4&quot; wide, and 3 1/2&quot; deep!
That's at least double the size of a new Eberspacher!!!!!! 

I quite accept that these LPG heaters are cheep and do have a place, but for
reasons of safety they just aren't suitable for mobile / continuous /
overnight use in a small VW T2 RV.

Suitable stationery heaters such as the Carver, or Propex are not cheep but
they are good and safe. Same goes for a petrol heater too and it's legal to
use while moving.

OK I don't live in the arctic but I'm not a fair weather camper either. I've
used my camper in all months of the year, scraped the ice off the inside of
the windows in the morning and had the ice that's formed behind the cab head
lining drip on me while driving. A heater in my old bus would have wonderful
and I have considered this type of heater myself but I'd rather put on a
jumper than have an unsafe heater.

Please this post IS NOT a flame - just a statement of the dangers, inconvience
and imparticalities and possible illegalities of using any portable gas heater
in the confined spaces of a VW camper.

Good luck
Bob
