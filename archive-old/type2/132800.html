Subject: RE: [T2] problems with removal of upper torsion arm

I just did my ball joints on a 72 Westy.  You definately want all rubber
stoppers out of the way.

The upper arms were very hard to come off, but I got them off eventually.
Make sure you use a prybar and lift them up until you clear the little metal
stump near where the rubber was.

I used a sledge hammer.  It took many whacks, and little by little they came
off.  MY ARM got really tired (and sore the next day) but the torsion arms
did come off. Luckily I did it in an industrial area.  I don't think
neighbors would have appreciated all the banging.

Getting them on wasn't too hard, once you clear the little metal stump just
hammer them in.

 My understanding is that
the torsion arm should slide off, but its stuck on there. How do I get
it off? Sledge hammer? Any tricks I need to know about?
