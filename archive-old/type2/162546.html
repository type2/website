&gt; I'd like to personally thank Jeff Stewart for moving JBB up a week

and there is a freeze warning for the JBB site
&gt;
&gt; If JBB had been scheduled for its usual week we'd have had to miss
&gt; it: Buffalo got hit with two feet of snow yesterday and the Peace
&gt; Bridge in Fort Erie has been closed all day.

rain beats snow in Oct.
