Subject: berg temp senders

you don't have to deal with the oildipstick type if you are worried 
about the belt taking it out, having to deal with guessing the oil 
level, oil leaking past the sender, etc IF you have a universal, fi 
or t3 case... berg makes a 'shorty' version of the dipstick sender 
that goes into the blockoff plate for the 't3' dipstick location. put 
it on and leave the stock dipstick tube for its inended poipose!
