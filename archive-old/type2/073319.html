Great ideas but if you don't have the means to do the below, try using carb
cleaner.  Get a can of it with the plastic straw tube attached and stick
the straw in the open bleeder valve with the brake line plugged (the
bleeder valve opening should be a close fit to the diameter of the straw).
Spray, and the propellant should force the pistons out.

&gt;&gt;Any remedies on how to cure stuck caliper pistons??
&gt;
&gt;#1 - compressed air in the brake line opening.  put a piece of wood or
&gt;     something else soft to catch the piston as it comes out of the bore
&gt;     so not to mar the piston surfaces
&gt;
&gt;or my favorite
&gt;
&gt;#2 - screw a zerk fitting into the caliper (or wheel cylinder) brake line
&gt;     opening and use a lever arm grease gun to gently force the piston out.
