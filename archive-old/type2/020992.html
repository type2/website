Short story: (Email me for pics re how my method looks on 78 Westy)
I got the canvas with the side screens from BUS DEPOT, and found the
height of the material a bit short to do the proper overwrap on the
plastic top edging.  Common sense told me to staple the top flush
without the foldover, and do the bottom first for less labor and to get
good underlayment below the screw on trim.  Staple top last and cover
with decorative trim.  Worked fine. Still very tight when top is lifted.
Long story:
Used a butterfly impact wrench with a screwdriver tip on the &quot;thousand&quot;
little trim screws, first using a marker to indicate exact centers top
and bottom.  The top needs prying of the plastic edging staples, an
excellent staple puller can be made by sharpening one side of a
needlnose plier so it slips in easily, press and wiggle/pull it easily
out.  Same applies to removing the staples that stay in the strip once
you pull it.  Spent a lot of time pulling these and ended up not using
them because the replacement canvas was not tall enough for it to lip
over the strip.  Thus I decided to go the easier route of doing the
bottom first and then stapling the top directly to the wood trim under
the fiberglass.  The front lift arms must be unscrewed at the bottom for
the canvas &quot;loop&quot; to go outside of them.  Also, I think the front bar
holding the bolts to the fiberglass top must be unbolted so you can work
behind it.  Mark the centers on the replacement top and bottom so they
will be vertical later.
     Start with the front center to install the trim, using an ice pick
to locate the holes in the roof through the canvas before putting the
screws in.  Pull the canvas tighter than you think is needed or you will
run short at the other end!!!!!!  To be neat, you must notch the piping
in the corners.  Once past the corners,  You should attach the center in
the rear- found it much easier to remove the foam pad to have more
clearance; in fact I removed the flipover board so I had standing room
to work on the sides and rear.  Work your way to the corners in back
(may have to stretch sides a lot)- and this work in the rear is MUCH
easier when done first!  Install the side strips, averaging out the
stretch.
    I did use an electric arrow stapler, which is strong enough for
stapling the canvas to the wood, but not likely through the plastic
strip also, which seemed very stiff with age.  I did the former, getting
the black edging on the canvas flush to the roof, and work from the
center front out.  Reduce the stretch by lowering the top onto 2x4.s
spanning from the floor to the top in each corner.  I seem to remember
that because the arms were unbolted at the top, I used sash cord to hold
the arms in a partially closed position so the tops wouldn't scratch the
fuzz.  I used lots of staples, starting with the centers of the sides
and always halving the distance between initial staples to even out the
fabric.  The back is the toughest (but easier stapling the canvas
last).  After lots of staples (like 3 rows at least) I used spray glue
on a piece of molding ribbon from a fabric store to cover the stapled
canvas; you could also use wood trim I suppose screwed over the canvas. 
It still is very tight, as shown by the lift arm elbows really pushing
on the fabric compared to the stock appearance.  I can send pics of the
inside top if someone wants.
