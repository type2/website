Subject: Re: ideas to keep the bus

Brad -

I have a Club on Itch, but I really don't think it's gonna keep away anybody
of any resolve.

Here's what I do when I'm away for any period of time. I have a &quot;coil wire&quot;
that's hollow on the inside (a gas hose with appropriate coil/dizzy plugs).
Obviously, it won't work. I put it on Itch when I leave. It looks complete,
so I hope it the thief would look elsewhere for &quot;no ignition&quot;.
