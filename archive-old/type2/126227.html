Subject: Re: [T2] water injection was Re: Strange thoughts when bored at
  work...

[...]
Quit trying to reinvent the wheel.  
&lt;http://www.racetep_dot_com/wik.html#nah20&gt; Had one on my Datsun 1200  
racecar and on my blown TR4.  Worked as advertised.

HOWEVER... This is water injected into the incoming fuel/air charge.  
Not water spraying on hot metal.  Water on hot metal just sounds wrong.

&gt; Of course, you need to add more water mixture when you fill your tank.
