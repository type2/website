Subject: RE: [T2] Front Brakes- Squeaking and Hot

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure if the brakes were adjusted properly by the
PO...&lt;&lt;

first things first. what year bus? that will tell us if you have drum or
disc front brakes.

if your acceleration seems slow &amp; the hubcaps/rims are getting hot then yes
i would say the brakes are binding/dragging.  first try adjusting them (get
the Muir book). if that doesn't work, inspect the brake hoses. the hoses are
usually the culprit &amp; they aren't really expensive to replace if you don't
mind getting your hands dirty.

HTH,
