Subject: headliner glue?
Message-ID: &lt;3767DDA5.C46F60CE_at_aztek-eng_dot_com&gt;

I've just spent 100 plus bones on some really cool fabric to replace the
tacky white contact paper in my bus.  The PO did a nice job on the front
headliner and I want to do a comparable job in the back.  I plan to
cover the bottom of the top bunk and the side panels that run down each
side of the bus.  My question is, will 3M spray adhesive do the job?  If
anyone has any experiences doing this, I'd love to here them...  I've
read the archives, but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.
Thanks in Advance...
