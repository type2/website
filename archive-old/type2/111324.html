&gt;
&gt;The problem is this:
&gt;
&gt;The engine idles fine, but when you rev it, there is a popping noise. It
&gt;doesn't disappear when you pull any of the plugs. Lifters are adjusted at 2
&gt;turns. Compression is good. Pulled a couple lifters and there is a bit of
&gt;scoring on the surface, and they don't push in as others do- they are
&gt;completely stiff. The PO said it threw a valve and replaced the heads,
&gt;lifters, valves. Replaced with 914 head and VW OE valves and lifters.
&gt;Could this cause popping?
&gt;
&gt;The bus is new to me. It ran fine for 2-3 weeks after I had it, and then one
&gt;day it started popping like crazy. As a side note- I changed the exhaust from
&gt;Monza style back to stock which is when this started. I pulled the exhaust
&gt;back off, RTVd it, and no popping. Next day, popping. I don't know if it is a
&gt;coincidence. There are no leaks that I can feel.
&gt;
&gt;UPDATE:
&gt;
&gt;The overwhelming response here was- exhaust leak.
&gt;
&gt;I called the mechanic this morning and told the whole story about the popping
&gt;stopping after I re-installed the exhaust.. I told him I'd bring my old
&gt;exhaust in to swap it and see if the noise stops, but he doesn't think that is
&gt;the problem. He says the popping noise (not a metal/metal pop) is originating
&gt;in the carb (Single Weber progressive).
&gt;
&gt;I am at a loss on this. What could it be?
