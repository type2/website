Subject: engine breakin/pistons....trip comin

hey volks,
ive got a question for you.   i have a trip comin up
in a little over 2 weeks from Nebraska to NY.  
currently my motor(1800 cc) is in the driveway sans
heads and pistons.   im waiting for my new
pistons/sleeves to come.....please, please, please let
it be today!!!! anyways, i was reading in the type 2
library about engine break in and wondering what is
necessary for piston/ring break in rather than the
entire engine?   also how long a break in do the
pistons need seeing i am leaving for NY soon.   i am
going to take the bus, even if i have to take side
roads, varying my speed and changing oil frequently
etc.   all help always appreciated.   i will also be
adding oil temp and head temp gauges before leaving.
thanks
shelby
