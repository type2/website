I have had to come to grips with the fact that I don't have the
time/money/space to properly fix this bus correctly. I wish it to go to the
best home, a home that will care for him and fix him up!

A few details:

1978 VW Double (Crew) Cab
Originally from Central America
Has a 2.0 liter Type IV motor
Euro-spec'd: Headlights, dash, speedo (K/mH), etc.
Rust: small holes in doglegs, a few spots in rocker panels. Floor, roof and
bed has surface rust.
Gates: Right and rear gates have slight damage. (see
http://www.insync_dot_net/~kittman/doublecab for pictures.)

I just rebuilt the 2.0 liter motor. It's still on the engine stand. The
pressure plate/clutch needs to be installed, as well as the manifold and
carb assembly. (There are a few other minor pieces needed to complete. Call
or p-mail for info.)

Motor details:
Align-bored Vanagon case
Standard (not turned) crankshaft
Hyrdraulic camshaft and lifters (new hydraulic lifters, pushrods, and
pushrod tubes)
*NEW* cylinders, pistons, and rings
Rebuilt heads (done locally at the best place in town)
72-74 style heater boxes
Rebuilt dual 32-34 PDSIT-2 carbs

Price: $4000 obo

Please p-mail me at kittman_at_insync_dot_net or call at 713-443-4484 if you have
any questions.

The bus is located in Houston, Texas. Will consider different delivery
options.
