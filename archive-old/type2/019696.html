Subject: Heater Cable Repair Procedure

Sean Bartnik has written an excellent description of the how to replace
heater cables.  It can be found in the Type2 library.  Even though the
procedure is written for the air cooled vanagon, it does a great job of
detailing what you need to do for bay windows.  After following the
procedure to change the cables on my 71, I thought that I would pass on
a few steps that may be different for at least the 69 to 71 bay windows
and aren't described in the Bentley or Sean's vanagon procedure.

1.  Read Sean's procedure in the Type2 library.  What follows here are
steps that are specific to the 71 bus and  not a complete procedure.
They probably apply to earlier bay windows.  I don't know if they are
correct for bay windows with the Type 4 engine.

2.  Remove the pedal pan.  You will need to do this in order to remove
the old cable and route the new cable through the frame and into the
bowden tube.

3.  Disassemble the cable at the heater boxes.  Chances are the cable is
broken at the heater box.  Remove the barrel clamp that secures the
cable to the heater box lever.  Remove the rubber cover at the end of
the bowden tube if it is still there.  After thirty years it may be long
gone.  There should be a nylon cap at the end of the bowden tube that is
pressed into a U-shaped cut in a steel strap hanger attached to the
frame.  Pull the nylon cap out of the U and remove it.  Look for a small
white plug at the end of the bowden tube.  Remove the plug and slide the
cable through the slit in the plug.  Straighten the end of the wire in
the cable in case there are any bends or hooks made as part of a quickie
repair job.  You are now ready to remove the cable.

4.  Remove the cable.  Go back to the pedal pan area and pull the cable
out of the bowden tube.  Save any rubber caps or grommets you find.
Sean recommends tying a string to the end of the cable at the heater box
before you pull the cable and using the string to pull the new cable
through the bowden tube.  I didn't have to do this on my 71.  I just
sprayed some silicone lubricant on the black rubber and shoved the cable
through the bowden tube.

5.  Installation is basically the reverse of removal.  Replace the plug
and cap at the end of the bowden tube. Shove the nylon cap into the U in
the strap hanger.   Put the rubber cover over the nylon cap.  Attach the
cable end to the heater box lever using the barrel clamp.

Remember to read Sean's complete procedure and wear safety glasses.
This procedure drops a lot of dirt in your face.
