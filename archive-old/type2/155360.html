Subject: Need recommendation of a repair shop in San Pedro/Long Beach,
  CA

Volks,

First, how is everyone?

Second, I have a little problem.  Back a couple years ago Nikki Elko
bought this bus out in LA.  Nice bus, '69 Euro-westy, basically a
stripped shell but it looked restorable to my east-coast eyes.  Her and
I were gonna restore it, but that didn't work out.  She has recently
moved and I need to do *something* with the bus.  During the time she
and I worked on it we did the brakes, put in a decent used engine and
basically got it roadworthy.  That was four years ago.  It's been
sitting ever since.  I was out there in January and looked it over and
really, really wanted to jump in and drive it back then and there.
Nikki and I had a bit of a &quot;discussion&quot; about that and I didn't.

I want to drive it back, but I'd like to have a shop look it over and do
some work on it before I do.  What I *know* it needs (and want
repaired):

Brake reservoir leaks.  Probably cracked and needs to be replaced.
Lights have gremlin issues and need to have the terminals polished.
Turn signal collar is loose on the steering column.
Front engine tin (1600DP) needed.

What I'd like inspected are the tires and the brakes.
I'd also like a valve set and tune up.

Anyone have recommendations as to a shop in the San Pedro/Long Beach
area that could handle this sort of thing?  In addition, I'd love it if
they could store the bus until I fly out on 2/20.

Lastly, if this all works out, I'll be driving back across the US in
late February.  This will, depending on weather either be via the
extreme southern route (I-8 to I-10 to I-95 in Jacksonville and then
north on 95 to DC) or split at El Paso to I-20/I-40/I-81 and drop the
bus in Salem (are you listening, Mark?) between 2/20 and 2/25.
