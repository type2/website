Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Drift

Hi Peter,

Does gravel count?

Back in 1986 I had a 72 westy with a 914 engine in it, where the top  
of third gear was a very peppy 55MPH.  I could get it completely  
sideways on one particular S-bend in a logging road on the way to the  
cottage we rented in South River, Ontario.

It was a fun engine while it lasted. Being that I was young and  
stoopid at the time, that wasn't as long as it should have been.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
