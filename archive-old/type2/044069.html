Subject: [T2] Yakima bike rack on roof of 70 Westfalia?

Has anyone had success w/ installation of a Yakima bike rack on the roof of a bay window Westfalia camper?  My hope is that I can use the high-rise gutter mounts (i.e. the 1A High-Rise Raingutter Towers) to install the crossbars (can I use the 78&quot; crossbars?) over the OE luggage rack on the rear of my 1970 Westfalia.  Then I can attach the Yakima fork mount bike racks I already own and maybe add a cargo basket.  The idea is that I will be able to mount theh rack close enough to the rear of the bus that I will be able to raise the roof w/o dismounting the rack.  If this works, I know that it will make the bus very tall, but I want the bikes out of the way of the rear hatch and engine compartment door.  I checked the Yakima web-site (http://yakima_dot_com), but it contains no info on fitting a bay window bus, much less a Wesfalia.  I checked the archives and found at least one recommendation for using a Thule rack on what appeared to be a vanagon westy by Craig Charles on 06/07/96 (\vanagon_at_lenti\van96.06\msg12174), but I found nothing on using Yakima.  I'd prefer to  make Yakima work b/c I already have lots of the accessories.  Thanks,
