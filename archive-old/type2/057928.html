Subject: rear spotlight / blew 10 amp fuse / cause?

Installed and wired a 12v tractor headlight on the rear bumper
of the '76 until I can get the reverse lights working (bad ground?
dead wire from coil?).

Wired it off the fuse block in the closet (10 amp fuses), ran it up
to the dash and a 30 amp illuminated switch (looks NICE). Yesterday
morning the voltmeter read a bit low, by the time I'd gotten to work
the voltmeter was dead and the rear spot was dead. Checked and
changed the fuse this morning.

Is there anything obvious to anyone in this setup that would cause
the fuse to give up the ghost? Clues welcomed. Thanks!
