Subject: Re: [T2] grinding in 2nd

Worn tranny synchronizers, poorly adjusted clutch, poorly adjusted shifter, 
worn shifter coupler, dirty oil in the tranny (GL-4 spec only!).

Start with the easiest and cheapest solutions and work up.

I suspect a worn tranny synchronizer. This is not a normal problem if the 
tranny is in good condition, yours is either the victim of a hard driving 
PO or many, many miles.

I would stop shifting down into 2nd and experiment to see if you can find a 
good way to shift into second from first without noises. If you cannot you 
will need a tranny repair or replacement.

&gt;Ok. This is probably an easy one but here goes. Sometimes when i shift 
&gt;from 1st to 2nd (duh!) the gear grinds. Also it sometimes happens when I 
&gt;downshift from 3rd. It doesnt happen in any other gears only 2nd. It 
&gt;usually wont go into 2nd until I rev the engine or complety slow down and 
&gt;put it in 1st. Should I be really concerned about this or is it somewhat 
&gt;normal. Thanks. Also my bus is a 72 westy with a 1700cc engine
