pete-
missed your other post.
you can sort the FI if you use the
computer wire to the coil like a switch
and trigger the injectors individually
(pull one and check the spray ).
the injection computor is not really
smart, it works or it doesn't. and yours
works ( you have fuel and the engine runs ).
so you would be looking for a malfunctioning
or dead injector, or maybe restricted pump
output ( or plugged filter ) or something like that.

so then back to the ignition- if it feels like the engine
is down 25 % power it would be evident that no spark
gets to one plug, and that is fairly easy to find.

otherwise, hesitation is one of the founding principles of a vw
and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it at all  8^).
