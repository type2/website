Subject: Joel, change the stats! The 78 is official!

Last night we took possession of the 78 bus. 76k miles, gas heater, very
little rust on the body. It hadn't been driven since 1991. It did take a
little doing to get it going. I put in a new engine seal, new Bosch plugs
and wires, new battery, a new Bosch coil, drained the gas tank. It didn't
start, so I did the basic fuel injection tests in Bentley. Still no start.
The PO then began to help me, and he thought the problem was in the
condenser. So, we ordered one through the local NAPA, got it the next day
and put it in. Still didn't start. I asked the PO if he had recently
checked and adjusted the points. He gave me that look, went to the garage
for the feeler gauges, and went to work. Several minutes later, boom, it
started. It runs well and cool (on 20 miles of steep, hilly roads, the
engine barely warmed up). Steering is tight. The brakes need work, probably
some adjustment and bleeding (new pads 3k miles ago). Also, the shift
linkage is loose.

Since I'm new to all this, there are some things I discovered:
1. If you're a &quot;complete idiot,&quot; don't assume anything, especially the
basic tuneup stuff. Follow the directions in Bentley and Muir.
2. You can easily install an engine seal without dismantling the fuel
injection system. As you get the right side of the engine, however, I found
it easier to thread the seal through the bottom of the engine tin and push
it through the tin toward the top. It's hard to squeeze it past the
injectors and gas line on that side.
3. Old spark plug sockets (the ones that attach at the end of a spark plug
wire to the spark plug) are useful to start the plugs in cylinders 2 and 4
if your spark plugs wrench won't hold them securely.
4. As disgusting a job it is, draining the gas tank on a vehicle not
recently driven must be a good idea. The gas was the color of strong tea. I
feel good about getting the crud out of tank.

Before winter, I want to touch up the body and put in a new battery, as
well as continue to do the regular maintenance stuff. I also need to figure
out the gas heater.

Over Labor Day, we're going to be camping in Door County in Wisconsin,
which is the arm of Wisconsin that extends into Lake Michigan.

So, Joel, cross out our 74 Bus and add our 78 Bus to both lists. Ya-hoo!

Our seven-year-old was standing in the passenger compartment and marveling
that he could stand up in the bus. Our thirteen-year-old can't decide
whether the bus is extremely cool or embarassing. Guess which one I'm
campaigning for :).
