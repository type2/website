Subject: Paint and other stuff

Hi All,

I know this will sound like heresy to some of you, but a question
about paint: Does anyone have experience with rustoleum? Brushed
or rolled?

&gt;snippage
&gt;I know they are both just vendors trying to make sales but it
&gt;just felt like bad etiquette.

Felt like free enterprise to me. Most everything in this world nowadays
cost more. What you described is essentially the basis of our economy.
However, we all are allowed our opinions. 

Thanks,

Pete
