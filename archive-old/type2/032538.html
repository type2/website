Subject: Type 2/Vanagon tires (tyres)

I dropped off our 1970 Campmobile for some &quot;warranty service&quot; on the newly 
re-rebuilt 1600SP today, and while I waited for my ride home I did an informal 
survey of the tires on the motley collection of Type 2s and Vanagons in the 
lot.

I looked at more than a dozen vehicles, and not a single bus or Vanagon had 
the proper size or rating tires installed.

The majority had all-season passenger car radials, and all had oversize tires 
that were obviously inflated to pressures beyond the manufacturer's 
specifications.

I don't know if this indicates a general ignorance on the part of the owners 
or the limited availability of tires with the correct size and load 
rating/capacity.  Probably a bit of both.  Either way, it's a sad commentary 
on the plight of our beloved vee-hickles.

One wonders how many buses/Vanagons are crashed because over-inflated sub-spec 
tires failed catastrophically at speed (&quot;speed&quot; being a relative term, of 
course), or in the midst of a high-stress evasive maneuver.
