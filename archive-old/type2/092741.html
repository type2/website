Subject: Re: [T2] mixture distributor pipe for dual carbs

It is simply a vacuum balance tube. You can make one with hardware store 
materials.

Go for it.


&gt;Hey folks, I'm sorry to bother y'all with this, but I'm in need of a
&gt;mixture distributor pipe for a dual carb engine.  This is a metal pipe
&gt;about 1/2 inch in diameter that connects to the upper inside front (f i f)
&gt;part of the left hand carb, the left intake manifold, goes across the
&gt;engine under the air cleaner, and then connects to the right intake
&gt;manifold.  I'm also going to place an ad on thesamba_dot_com because I don't
&gt;think I'll have much luck finding this contraption.  does anyone who's
&gt;converted to dual webers or the like have one of these mixture pipes lying
&gt;around that they would like to sell to me?   many thanks, Greg

Ciao!
