&gt; Hello listees-
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted some advice - the throttle cable in my 71
&gt; is stuck and 
&gt; needs to be removed. Where can it possibly be hung up
&gt; and how do I remove 
&gt; it?

Carefully!  Start from the engine end and trace it along.  You shouldn't
have to apply force to get this cable out.
