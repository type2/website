Subject: RE: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

Talked with Jake Rabe this evening.  Jake expects to have header by-pass tubes
and a complete exhaust system available for type 4 engines in September.  Good
news for those not wishing to use traditional heater boxes.

I also talked to Jake about another related exhaust issue.  I explained to him
that the header pipes are running extremely hot.  The other evening after a
short drive I noticed they were cherry red.  So it seems my exhaust leak may
only be a symptom of another bigger problem.  Jake suggested a lean/rich
running condition and/or timing.  Valves will need to be adjusted.I'm running
a single webber, two-barrel carburetor.

Tiger at 714-836-7201.&gt; &gt; No website listed or email.&gt; &gt; Or Jake himself!&gt; &gt;
Jon Stiles&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if/where type 4 header pipes can&gt; &gt; be
purchased?&gt; &gt; if you find a place let me know, I am using header pipes on my
78 and had&gt; to make them by stripping the fins and tin also&gt; &gt; Bob&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
