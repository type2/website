Well I'm sure not going to argue this point with anyone.

Everybody can do exactly as they want; but think about this. Everybody
that grinds cams says No No No you cannot alternate the lifters in either
direction. Crankcases, heads and rebuild jobs are too expensive to risk
destroying an engine.

So exactly what kind of performance, cam life, valve life can you expect
by doing something half assed ?

You guys do it your way and I'll do it the right way.

I'm not the cam guru so you guys should consider picking up the phone and
call your buddies at Boston Bobs or any other rebuilder that you prefer
and get yourselves properly advised.

If I'm wrong I'll readily admit it............... so prove me wrong with
a reply from a genuine cam grinder.

&gt; &gt; Start off with a solid lifter cam.
&gt; &gt; You can't put solids on a camshaft ground for hydraulics.
&gt; 
&gt; True, perhaps, but this gentleman wants to go from solid lifters to
&gt; hydraulics. Many have done this with the solid cam, though a 
&gt; hydraulic cam
&gt; is always nice if you're splitting the case anyway. You need eight 
&gt; hydraulic
&gt; lifters and eight hydraulic pushrods, and since you can pull the 
&gt; lifters on
&gt; a Type 4 engine using a mechanic's magnet while the longblock is 
&gt; installed,
&gt; the job's a Saturday morning drop-in.
