Importance: Normal
Subject: Busses by the Trail/Knoebel's  (this weekend!)

&gt; Just a quick reminder that Kampers _at_ Knoebel's is coming up over
&gt; Labor Day weekend, which is just a few short weeks away.  Details at:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/bbtt/



Just a last-minute reminder for anyone who has no plans this weekend and is
not too far from central PA.  Evon, Haley and I are hoping to make it a day
trip on Sunday (unless the weather report changes; so far looks good), since
we have commitments for part of the weekend and are close enough to do it in
a day.  We'll definately try to swing by the campground in the morning to
say &quot;hi.&quot;   I guess a ton of VW vans will be pretty easy to find.

Anyone else bringing young kids?  Haley (3 years old) would love to have a
playmate on the rides!

Incidentally, Knoebels Amusement Park, for those who are interested, is well
worth visiting, very reasonably priced, clean, and with lots of rides for
young kids as well as adults and older kids.  No admission fee - you can pay
by the ride or buy a day-long pass, and the per-ride prices are quite low.
Even the parking's free. One of the oldest remaining family-owned
free-admission amusement parts, with a long history.  www.knoebels_dot_com .
