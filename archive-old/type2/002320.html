Folks,

My 1978 fuel injected bus has three problems that may or may not be related.
They are:

     -&gt; during cold weather, the bus needs to warm up for two or three
minutes
               before going anywhere. During warm weather, no problem
     -&gt; during warm weather, the oil indicator takes a long time (~20
seconds)
               to extinquish after starting. During cold weather, no
problem.
     -&gt; during warm weather, the engine continues to run smoothly after
               turning the key to the off position and removing it. During
               cold weather, no problem. Also no problem during warm weather
               if the engine has been running for 15 minutes of less.

The warm weather problems just started this weekend when we flirted with the
90 degree mark in Northern Virginia.

Could some temperature sensor be causing all three problems?
