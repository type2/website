Subject: Question on seat upholstery reinstallation

Dear List,
My wife and I are working on completing a long-outstanding project --  
reupholstering the front seats of our 1973 camper.
Unfortunately, we took the old upholstery off so long ago that  
neither of us remember exactly how the driver's seat back upholstery  
is supposed to be secured.  Rather than poke holes in the new  
upholstery in the wrong places, I decided to take some pictures and  
ask the list.

The pictures are looking at the back side of the seat back.  The  
metal piece with the tabs is at the bottom of the seat back.  Are  
both sides of the upholstery supposed to make it to the bar and be  
secured with this one set of tabs?

Thanks
-lilmatt
