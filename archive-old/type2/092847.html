Subject: RE: Camping World - Battery Isolators

Everyone,

I have been talking about the high-power relay I got at Camping World for a 
long time now.  Unfortunately, it looks like it has been discontinued since 
I got mine.  I called them and talked to sales and tech support and they 
say all of their relays have been discontinued.  It should still be 
available at other RV stores though.  I have a picture of mine if anyone is 
interested - pmail me directly.

-David
