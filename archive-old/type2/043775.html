&gt;&gt; dont sell it!!!!! install it in your bus under the package tray and astound
&gt;&gt; people.  you can gets lots of 8 tracks for it too.  they are 69 cents each at
&gt;&gt; the loacl Oly, WA Goodwill
&gt; 
&gt; If it's an in-dash version, install it in the radio hole in the dashboard
&gt; and really turn some heads...if you're gonna have a hippie bus, why not have
&gt; a hippie stereo in it?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, you gotta find somewhere to mount the state-of-the-art head-end
&gt; for the CD changer that actually makes the tunes you listen to...

Actually, you could install a CD changer that uses low power FM broadcast to
get the signal to your stereo. Then you wouldn't need to mount a head-end at
all. The CD changer is controlled via remote.
