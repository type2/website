Subject: [T2] Fuel hose needed

Hi All,

I have a 1973 Westfalia I am restoring and I am hoping someone out on the
list can point me in the direction of a &quot;new&quot; gas filler hose.  This hose
runs between the filler neck and tank, is about a foot or so long and very
challenging to replace.

Any help would be appreciated,
Brian 
Salem, Or
