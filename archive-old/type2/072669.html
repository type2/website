Subject: engine rebuild-cylinder bore help!
Message-Id: &lt;v01530501b37a2de6cf6d_at_[204.221.85.122]&gt;

        Hi, I was just putting new cylinder/pistons on my '71 1600cc so I
thought.  I got the 85.5mm cylinders &amp; when we went to put them on they
were way too small.  The case bore on my engine is approx. 96mm  The
cylinders headside approx. 97mm, case side 95.5-96mm &amp; the piston approx.
90mm.  I don't know what kind of engine I have.  The PO thought it was a
1600 dual port, but the bore is way too big for that.  The # on the engine
is AE 399591 and on the side of the engine below the oil filler was #
293400.

        I can't find any cylinders that would fit my engine.  The engine
was not running &amp; was in my '69 when I got it.  Any help on what kind of
engine I have &amp; where I could find parts for it would be greatly
appreciated.... Or would it just be smarter to get a AVP shortblock since I
have all the parts for a 1600 dual?

Thanks in advance as always,
