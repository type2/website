&gt; Hmmm...now I'm not the brightest person with this theoretical stuff, so
&gt; please bear with me: Why would VW have decided to reduce the size of the
&gt; intake valve head between the 1800 and the 2000? I guess I don't
&gt; understand what a larger intake valve head means except that possibly more
&gt; of the air/fuel mixture has a chance to get into the cylinder on the
&gt; intake stroke. Wouldn't that generally be a good thing?

	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Diameter, lift, duration, timing,
and amount of restriction/pressure  in the intake tract,  all affect
aspiration. You could have small diameter valves that lift higher, for
longer in a freer breathing intake tract, and get more air/fuel in to the
cylinder. Note also resonance effects can also have significant effects at
certain RPMs, although I suspect these are minor in most four stroke
engines.
