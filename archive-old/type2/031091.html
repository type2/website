good price!

&gt; So, even if it needs an entire engine, it's a bargain. Supposedly, some

I would  disagree too, since VW's don't have head gaskets 

&gt; Basically, I am looking for advice on perfoming a very quick engine
&gt; overhaul, and what sorts of roadblocks I am bound to encounter. Does anyone
&gt; know of any good resources of information on rebuilding '78 2000cc engines?

if it is a siezed engine from lack of oil, it needs a total rebuild.  not
a three week job for anyone but a professional, or very experienced

stay far away from GEX.

&gt; That's what I assume it is, since that's the only one I've seen mentioned
&gt; as being in 78 buses. Also, I'm not sure about idetifying the type of the

stock in the USA the 78 had a 2 liter fuel injected engine.

Good luck, but if that trip is in 2 weeks, take the Dodge
