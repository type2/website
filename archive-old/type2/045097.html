Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning engine parts

I loaded up all of my engine parts tin, blower housing, crank case,
manifold etc. and took them to a local speed shop.  They have a machine
like a big dishwasher but much hotter.  Worked like a charm.  The
cosmoline was even removed from the oil galleys in the case.  Cost...$20
for all of it.
