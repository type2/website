First of all, bugs do not use the rear engine mount.  Only buses.

What kind of oil pump are you using.  Does it protrude out of the case or is it
fairly flush?

How thick is the oil pump cover?  Any brand name stamping?

What kind of fittings are coming out of the oil pump cover?

(snip)
: I am putting in a 1776 into my 70 bus. It's got dual carbs (what kind isn't
: important) and it's been routed for an external oil cooler.
(snip)my problem is that the rear mount wont fit
: because of the fittings for the external cooler. It seems the brass oil
: fittings are in the way.
