Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA question

&gt; Proper vacuum advance is only present from off-idle to 1/2 throttle. Above
&gt; 1/2 throttle vacuum advance is 0 and you have centrifugal only, which is the
&gt; same as a 009. This is why a properly setup SVDA will outperform a 009 in
&gt; ALL circumstances, because the worst it does is a 009 curve (1/2 to full
&gt; throttle).

This has got me scratching my head again because it just doesnt seem to
make sense. A vacuum only distributor would not function if it were the
case.
A vacuum only dizzy does work as I prove to myself every day.
so I do a little reading and find....

&quot;&quot;Now it is possible you confused manifold vacuum with port vacuum. Port
vacuum signal is generated via Burneulli's Principle in the carb's
venturi. The larger the volume of air flowing through the carb., the
stronger the vac. signal. At idle there is very little air flowing through
the carb and the vac. signal is very small. Basically no vacuum. At
wide-open throttle (WOT) and high RPM, the port vacuum signal is
strongest.&quot;&quot;

Im tempted again to stick a vac gauge in my dash.
