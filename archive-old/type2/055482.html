Need some help from the list, I am relatively new on this area I have been
hanging out in vanagon land but water boxers are taking over and I need a part
for my 81 vanagon.................  The first request is for the metal fuel
ring line that goes to the #3 and #4 fuel injectors, and goes to the pressure
relief valve at one end, its also the one that has the test port on it for
attaching a preesure gage to check pump output?        I need a part for the
heat booster for the eberspacher it is the manifold that the recirculator air
motor from under the rear seat blows into (its a brown bakelite type material?
I appreciate hearing from any one that has one of these mounted on a 78-83
van, as I have many questions on the installation and
use........................?   thanks in advance
