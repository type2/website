Subject: replacing fan is not first step

&gt;RE Is replacing this the first step in troubleshooting the problem?
&gt;      ^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;I purchased a 78 bus not long ago and when testing the heating system out I
&gt;blow the 16amp fuse when I turn on the heat.  Is this a bad blower fan /
&gt;wheel causing this most likely?  Is the part in question #11 in this image?
&gt;Is replacing this the first step in troubleshooting the problem?
&gt;
Nope, do not replace the fan, just test the fan. First, remove any #$_at_!%%&gt;
mud daubers or mice stuck in the fan keeping it from turning. Then spin the
squirrel cage with your fingers. It must turn relatively easily, but it will
not coast. It the fan passes the spin test, then get some jumper wires and
put 12 volts directly on the fan quick connect. Be very careful not to short
out the jumper cables directly to themselves. If you are clumsy or paranoid,
you can make up a set of jumper cables with an in line fuse holder and put
in a fuse of the appropriate rating for what you are testing.
