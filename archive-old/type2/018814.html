Subject: About Bus Depot, I agree with Bill/Janyce
Message-ID: &lt;378F6245.27DE_at_usit_dot_net&gt;

Though I have never done any business with Bus Depot, I have called for
advice on a part I bought from a listee.  I have also read many of the
posts written by Ron.  And I have come to think that it is both VERY
unfair to Bus Depot as a reputable business and to Ron as a good and
decent VW owner/person, to complain openly to the List.  Especially when
it appears that the person doing the complaining has not bothered to
bring such a problem to those at Bus Depot.

I rarely post any messages to the List, but I do read almost all of
those posted by members, and as a VW owner and hobbyist, I have a vested
interest in keeping everyone honest and watching out for other VW
friends, whether I know them or not.

Let's just be fair and concerned about others.  It is what makes VW
owners better than everyone else.
