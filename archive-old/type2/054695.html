Subject: CV Joints

It's time to replace some of the CV joints on my 74 Bus....I am pulling
parts from a donor bus of same year.
Question....  are all the CV joints the same..in other words can I take the
right side CV joint(wheel end) from donor bus  and use it on the left tranny
side  of other bus??????
Has anyone priced replacement CV joints from VW dealer recently??  Prices???

Thnx
Glen
