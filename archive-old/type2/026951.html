Dear list,
     About two weeks ago I posted to the list the problem I was having with 
a mexican longblock I bought from BFY parts in Orange. When I got the motor 
home I noticed the the headnut paint had been broken. At some point the 
heads had been take off. I called them and talked to the owner and he told 
me that they took the heads of all the Mexican longblocks to seal the base 
of the cylinders. SO I accept his explanation. All of the list members who 
responded said I should just get a refund. I should have done that.
    NOW GET THIS! We are building up the engine to put in my friends bus and 
we take off the valve cover to discover that the adjustment screw top is all 
mangled with bits of cardboard in the slot. The whole rocker arm shaft was 
bent! At some point this engine was dropped,hardcore. I call up BFY again. I 
get the owner named Darryl. I tell him the situation. He says get it fixed 
and they will compensate me double. I say no I want a new engine in the box. 
He agrees saying I should call him on Monday and he will know when they will 
have one in. So that is where I am. I wanted to keep those who offered me 
advice updated. I also am looking for support from the list. I am going to 
take all of copies of any email that I get to BFY if they try to back out on 
exchanging the motor. I do not want to blackmail BFY I just want the motor I 
thought we were buying.

Brian Lanahan
