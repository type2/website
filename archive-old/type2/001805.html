The Tour kicked off yesterday in MA. I drove the first (albeit rainy) leg
from Massachusetts to the MA/Rhode Island line to meet John Perry in his '79
Westy. From there, John trekked further down RI to meet up with Rich
Macensky, and Rich will be carrying the torch down to New Jersey today.

It's still not too late to sign up, and we're still routing as we go. Right
now, the plan seems to be forming to take the Tour to BBBT, then go on from
there. It should go to MD after that, making its way down the East Coast.

We've revamped the website, making it a bit easier to get around, with no
extraneous stuff. Note that due to the revamping, some file names have
changed, and we have not been able to create redirects from all the old
pages yet. So if you'd like to keep up-to-date on the Tour, your best bet is
to get there from the main Bussin' page at http://www.excalibre_dot_com/bussin.

The Great BusTour rolls on! Hope to see you participate!
