Subject: Re: [T2] How do you check a hall sender unit? - was Cant get a
  spark?

&quot;The Hall control unit, checking&quot; section of Bentley is very long - 2
pages - and not entirely logical.  Bypass the idle control stabilizer just
to make sure it's not affecting things.

It's the Hall sender and Hall control unit that &quot;trigger&quot; the coil so if you
think you're getting spark from the distributor center wire - pull the
center wire from the distributor, put the end near the engine, have someone
crank the engine - but no spark to the plugs (same test, except you pull a
plug wire) then it would seem to be the rotor or ignition wires.

&gt; Still can't get a spark, but I have isolated the the
&gt; problem a little more.  Getting 12V to the coil, if i
&gt; hook up a dwell meter to the spark plug wire from the
&gt; coil (don't have a timing light right now) it jumps
&gt; around so i think the dist. cap is getting spark, but
&gt; there is NOT anything coming from the dist. to the
&gt; spark plug wires.  I have an 83 Cal model with an
&gt; electronic ignition.  Wondering if my hall sender is
&gt; bad and how i can check it, or what else i might check
&gt; as being the problem.  Thanks
