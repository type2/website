Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

From: &quot;Mat Nardone&quot; &lt;flatspel_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I obviously appreciate the fun of owning a bus, as I OWN one, but I
consider it a LUXURY. The NEEDS of my family necessitate that I have a safe
reliable vehicle for them.
&gt; So before you condemn me to the 9th plane, understand the true nature of
my point.

The point that owning a bus is a luxury?

I own a bus because someone was kind enough to give me the bus as a gift.
(It wasn't their fault that the rear seal went and screwed everything else
up 7 months later, BTW.)  It's my only vehicle because I can't afford
anything else.  (And with the engine replacement, I can't afford _anything_
else!)

It's taken years to recover from my wife's illness, over a decade.  While I
admit that having the finances to choose &quot;a safe reliable vehicle&quot; is a nice
thought, it's not always a possibility for everyone.

So before you condemn me to the 9th plane, understand the true nature of my
point (and wallet)!
