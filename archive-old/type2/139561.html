Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper question

Don,

Check them here...mine came from another supplier several years ago 
because Ron didn't offer them at the time.

I &quot;painted&quot; mine with the por-15 &quot;glisten&quot; product in order to protect 
them.

They came straight from Brazil....you can see them live here

&gt; I seem to be having trouble finding a good used rear bumper for my 73,
&gt; so I decided to go shopping for a new one.
&gt; 
&gt; BD has a primered bumper for $80. Chrome for $120. WW has primered for
&gt; $125, with no chrome listed.
&gt; 
&gt; Since it's obvious that I'll be getting it from BD (even with shipping
&gt; it's cheaper than WW where I can go pick it up), anybody have any
&gt; comments on the chrome one? Quality? I like the idea of not having to
&gt; paint it after I get it. And chrome is just so.... BLING!
&gt; 
&gt; The BD picture sucks, but it appears to have a rubber molding. Is this correct?
