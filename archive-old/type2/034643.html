Subject: Very short trip report

Just got back from retracing most of the trip I took back in April. This 
time I used one quart of oil to get from San Diego to Organ Pipe 
National Monument and back (about 750 mile round trip). Camped five days. 
Never touched my tool chest. Everything went perfectly.

Nothing much to report.

Thanks to y'all.

Mark and Peregrine
