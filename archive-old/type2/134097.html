Subject: Fuel Line Diagram  78 FI

Hi Folks:

I've been driving my 78 regularly for a few months but have a similar 
problem to Paul's.  When my gas level is below the 1/2 line bus runs 
great.  When I top it off, bus runs poorly and there is a leak in 
front of the left rear wheel.  I've replaced several visible pieces 
of fuel line before putting this bus on the road after it sat for 4 
years.  Guess I need a diagram to help me out.  The one in Bentley 
doesn't cut it.

Thanks,

BEN

PS, looking for infor on the stock FI unit as well.  Need to try to adjust it.
