&gt;I tried hooking up some newer side marker lights on my 77 Rivera after
&gt;crushing the older ones against a tree and when I hook them up, the fuse

&gt;up and hooking the negative wire to the metal plate in the new light, I
&gt;don't see why it shouldn't work without blowing fuses.

Are you hooking up the wires to the same side and bypassing the bulb accidentally which is causing the fuse to blow? Pos and neg are top and bottom not side by side.
