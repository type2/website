Subject: Synthetics/Engine Diagnostics

Well, the proof is in the putting, as they say and tonight I put the oil to
the teat. I made a 100 mile round trip running at
55-60 mph. The oil temp settled in at 185 and the pressure hovered at 35 psi
while driving in fourth gear at 55. At idke the pressure dropped to an
indicated 5 psi, but the dash light didn't come on or even flicker.
Drivability was as good as ever, nice and strong.

Should I be worried or am I being paranoid?

Thanks for all the advice,
Dave

PS: How does one test an oil pump?
