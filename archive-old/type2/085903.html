&gt;
&gt;Greetings Bus list members: I would like to get advise on a very subjective 
&gt;question:
&gt;
&gt;I now own a 67 21 DLX, a 70 Ghia, 73 SB and a 82 Rabbit Conv. A good friend 
&gt;wants to trade my 70 Ghia for his 1970 Crew Cab (double cab).  The ghia is 
&gt;all new, paint, motor, etc. The 70 Crew cab is all original, paint, motor, 
&gt;etc. The body is cherry, no dents, no rust (desert T2), motor runs 
&gt;strong.....just everything is 1970, its a true cream puff. Should I? Any 
&gt;thoughts on the 1970 crew model? How are parts availability for this model?
&gt;
&gt;What to do?
&gt;
&gt;Hart
