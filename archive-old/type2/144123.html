&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ...On that auction site, they have two
&gt; types of solar battery chargers. One plugs into the cigarette lighter
&gt; and one has clips that go onto the battery leads. Does anyone have
&gt; experience with the cigarette lighter version?

If you have a friendly local VW dealer, talk nice to the service guy and
see if he has any OEM VW &quot;keep alive&quot; solar panels.  One comes with each
new VW and from what i understand they are discarded when the car is
prepped for sale.  These panels come with a
cigarette lighter connector, but you can put whatever kind of connector
you with on it.  I use a small Molex connector that is more positive than
the cigarette lighter plug.

I bought mine from a VW mechanic at BBB.

Now, if I was a VW mechanic, I'd have an array of those thinge on my roof!
