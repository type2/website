Subject: RE: [T2] I hate my carbs

&gt;D-jet was an improvement over carbs, but is tricky to 
&gt;diagnose, especially for someone new to it.  AFC is 
&gt;much easier

I'll concede the L-jet being easier just based on the fact that it was a
new, improved FI and is still largely in use on many of today's modern
vehicles while the d-Jet was pretty much discontinued by the mid-70's.

&gt;The breathers on the heads are a must for D-jet! It is 
&gt;one of the main imputs for the fuel mixture to be right

I don't see how they can have anything to do with fuel mixture.  They have
hoses that &quot;T&quot; into to the flash-back valve that has a 3rd hose that goes to
the NON-pressurized air distribution box (so you're not sucking non-filtered
air into your heads).  Has nothing to do with fuel mixture and the FI system
will perform the same with or without it.

&gt;and it is NOT true that all 412, 411 and 914's had this.  
&gt;In 74 all went to L-jet (afc) except the 914 and the 412 
&gt;with the manual transmission.  The 914's followed suit 
&gt;shortly thereafter

All US model 914's with the 1970-1973 1.7 (engine codes W, EA, EB) and
1973-1976 914's with 2.0 motor (codes GA, GC) had D-jet FI while all of the
US model 1974-1975 914's with 1.8 (code EC) used L-jet.  There is evidence
that some of the European models had carberetor(s), but I can't say for
sure.

So as you say, &quot;So before you know it all, know it all.&quot;  :)
