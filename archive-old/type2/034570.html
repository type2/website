Attention SoCal bussers!

The esteemed H. Steve Dolan is coming to L.A. over the weekend of Jan.
15 &amp; 16 and I thought I'd throw together a gathering for any listees who
would like to meet him. 

Having absolutely *no* idea of the level of interest in an event like
this (i.e., how many people would show up), I'm not sure whether to
invite y'all over to my humble abode, have it at a park, or possibly
some other venue.

So, couldja let me know if you'd be interested in getting together, so I
can solidify some plans for this? It would be Saturday, January 15th. I
know it's kinda short notice, but I'd appreciate your input.

Nikki

P.S. I guess I should post this to the vintage and vanagon lists, too.
How do I do that?
