Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Hatch Seal Installation

Hal,

When I had buses like that, I always cut it at the bottom
corners where the joint was.  Most of the time you couldn't
tell it was cut untill you pulled the rear apron.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I purchased one of the engine hatch seals from ISPWEST on Ebay.  This is for
&gt; my 71 with the removable apron.  How do people install this so that they can
&gt; remove the apron but still have the engine compartment seal?  Was it
&gt; originally installed with glue on all 4 sides, or do i cut the bottom part of
&gt; the seal from the top and sides so than the apron will be removeable?  Whats
&gt; the concensus here?
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be in Taos all next week. Are there any good places around there to
&gt; scavenge parts?
