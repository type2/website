wow!! were you driving when it happened??  where you there when it
happened or was it parked??

&gt; exciting. So my question is; as the rest of the window is intact, would
&gt; it be cheeper to replace the glass or just get a used window? And has
&gt; anyone had this happen?

guess it depends on if you can get a piece of tempered glass the right
size and if you know how to install it...the sliding windows are getting
kinda &quot;desirable&quot; and beginning to become rare so it might be cost
effective to get it fixed, or at least put a piece of Lexan in the spot
for the time being
