Subject: interchangeable loaf window rubber
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

    Wanted to share with everyone something I recently discovered while
searching high and low for the non louvered window rubber, which goes on the
back side windows of a loaf.
  A couple of months ago i started gathering rubber for the dormobile that is
in the shop getting paint and body work.I quickly found that finding the
nonvented side window rubber pt#221-321c wasn't going to be easy.I contacted
several usually reliable vendors.All of which gave me the same
answer,Volkswagen stopped making that over a year ago and we don't know where
to get any.The only place I found it was the bus depot, but couldn't see
paying 59.00 a piece for the german stuff .WCM had not at the time gotten the
shipment of Mexican stuff that they said was held up at the Border and they're
still gearing up for production of it. I tried calling for several weeks and
constantly got the same answer...not here yet try again next week.I quickly
grew tired of all the run around but didn't think I had an alternative.
   Then in march I went to a show in Atlanta,went up to the new parts vendor
with the same question expecting the same answer and was very suprised when he
said &quot;yeah I got some that will work for 17.00 they're actually rear window
rubber pt #211-521c but they're a good fit&quot;. I thought this guy's got to be
kidding, he's selling WCM rubber and If it was interchangeable WCM would have
surely let me know this one of the times I called.Well, after much assurance
that it would fit I decided to take the chance. This week I decided to give it
a shot and found it does fit very nicely on the glass,no overstretching or
slack.
  Well they now have there shipment from Mexico, but want 28.00 as apossed to
the 18.00 for the rear window seals.I'll let you know how they hold up once
they're back on the bus for a time.
