Hi there.

I'd like to say thanx to everyone that helped diagnose my
 problem with poor idle in the morning.  

I think I corrected the problem last nite.

&lt;Memo to myself: when rebuilding carb, remember to make sure
the automatic choke thingy is hooked onto the rod doohickey.&gt;

This helps immensely.

Anyhow, this VW experience is supposed to be a learning thing,
right?  Well, I'm learning.  (Slowly)
