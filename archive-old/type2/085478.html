Subject: Re: [T2] Fixing Sliding Door

Hi Glen,

Take the panel off the inside of the sliding door. You will find a cable
connecting the handle to the rear latch with a tensioning adjuster bolt near
the rear latch mechanism. The problem is most likely that the tensioning
bolt has loosened off and the rear cable has gone slack, or is twisted and
binding somehow. It should be easy to sort where the issue is once you have
the panel off.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I was wondering if I could get some advice on the sliding door on my 70.  It
&gt; is stuck.  Actually I tried and tried to open it, couldn't get anything,
&gt; forgot about it, and a few minutes later it just popped right open on it's
&gt; own.  Kinda spooky really in an airplane hangar at 2am, I just about...
&gt; Anyhow, when I slid it back it very nearly got stuck in the full-open
&gt; position but after enough pushing I got it to move.  Now that it's closed
&gt; again I I haven't had any more ghostly openings of it.  I can't see anything
&gt; wrong.  Everything appears to be in great shape.  I do not know anything
&gt; about it though since I am new to the bus.  Glen Ward
