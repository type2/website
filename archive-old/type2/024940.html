Subject: Gonna Pull the Motor, I guess
Message-ID: &lt;97219b64.245d24fc_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt; back to reading Peter Rabbitt] . And when I pull motor .what other things 
&gt; should I be looking for to replace ,fix etc.

I'd get a pressure plate, clutch disc, throw out bearing, disc alignment tool 
&amp; flywheel lock, clutch shaft repair kit, TO bearing clips. and if you wanna 
get wild and it's leaking some oil or your starter is sketchy, a flywheel 
seal and starter bushing. 


&gt;  PO had 
&gt; motor rebuilt by reputable  local machine shop 16,000 miles ago , but that 
&gt; was &quot;1989&quot; obviously he didn't drive much,but motor seems in good shape.

probably due for a clutch job, if you're broke go for just the bearing disc 
and plate.
