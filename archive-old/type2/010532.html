O great and powerful list ---

Soon after installing KYB gas-adjust shocks all around
on my 74 Westy (nice not to have to consult the
turn-and-bank indicator when rounding an easy curve),
I noticed a noise, best described as a &quot;snick&quot; or
metallic &quot;click&quot;, coming from the general area under
the driver's seat each time I hit an irregularity in
the road.  The shocks that came with the loaf were
worn and really spongy; stiffening the ride has prob.
overly stressed another part of the suspension.  Sound
familiar to anyone?

Also, I assume that if I can grab the tie rod section
that connects to the right front spindle, and twist it
back and forth on its joints with almost no
resistance, that it's 'bout time to fix it?  TIA.
