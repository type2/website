&gt; Why go aftermarket? Do some junkyard shopping. My 74 has factory

&gt; also includes front and rear fog lights, you only need to search for
&gt; buses with factory fog lights (or the remains thereof).

Rear fog lights? I don't believe I have seen these (or can really come
up with a good use) anyone got any pics of what this particular beast
looks like?
