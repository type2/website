&gt; I'm surprised there isn't some altitude

the later 1970s FI engines had a Lamda sensor which, I think, will adjust the 
mixture for altitude. [obviously only within its operating limits]

The flap system as used in the 70s is however inherently flawed as it is 
trying to achieve the air fuel ratio by a measurement of volume. The current 
FI system which VW fits to its production air cooled engines uses a hot wire
and measures the cooling effect of the air passing over it which is 
proportional to the mass not the volume so the amount of fuel is always 
correct.

Read the Bentley FI manual if you dont believe me.

If you have a catalytic converter on your bus sit down and reckon up the cost 
of a new one - for correct operation they need the mixture to be spot on. The 
book says a bad mixture can very quickly wreck a 3 way catalytic convertor; 
but some people get away with it for years.

Good luck
