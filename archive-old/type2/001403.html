Jaime,

Check the end of the torsion bars. Is the little weld still there that holds
them together on the end?  Sounds like they are spread apart on the end.
use some masking tape wrapped around  the bars to bring them together. Then
slip/tap your torsion arm on......

Subject: [T2] TORSION ARMS HELLLPP!!!!!


&gt; I recently purchased a set of torion arms to replace my upper and lower
ball joints on my 68 westy.  I followed the directions that are listed in
the type2 library, and things went great.  Everything came off with out a
problem, ..... then it came time to put the new ones back on.  They will not
go back on.  The arms slide on and goes about 1.5&quot; away from where they need
to be and then stop.  According to the directions you just need to hammer
them on and they should go pretty easy. We hammered for 2hrs and they wont
go.  We did get the passenger side on with only a little trouble, but the
driver side is just being a real PITA!!!  I know that when the arm is lined
up correctly it kind-of catches and you can feel that is where it needs to
be.  This is how we got the passenger side on, but we are not feeling that
on the drivers side.  In the directions, it says that you can't put them on
one at a tiem, and that they not have to be somewhat in place before you
drive them in.  Do !
&gt; you have to drive them in at the same time?  Really volks, I am out of
ideas and dont' know what to do.  I have to have this thing back on the road
ASAP.  My other car is going into the shop and I had planned on using this
one.  The one thing that troubles me is that the one that we are having
problems with was shipped seporately from the rest.  I have looked down the
arm with a flashlight to see the design that it has, and they appear to be
the same.  I hope that there are no problems with the arm itself, and that
we are just missing the &quot;trick&quot; on how to get these things back in.  We did
try to put the old one back on just to see if there was something wrong with
the new arm, and we had the same problems with the old one as well. Any help
on the matter would greatly be appriciated!!!  Hope everyone has a good
Monday!
&gt;
