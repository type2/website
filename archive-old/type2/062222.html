Subject: re: Canvas for single cab

I've recently seen an ad, perhaps in the NEATO newsletter, for a guy 
on the east coast who will make the support hoops for single &amp; double 
cabs - from what I understand, there are also some wooden support 
pieces...On my ID sheet from Stiftung AutoMuseum they identify the 
tarp &amp; bows for the singlecab as Mcode 70 - Verdeck fur 
Pritschenwagen - a factory option.

I'd be very interested in procuring the tarp &amp; bows for my 
54singlecab...
