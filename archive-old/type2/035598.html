&gt; Thanks for the reply on my Type 4 motor.

&gt; &gt;EA engines were also used in the porsche 914.

&gt; 
&gt; shooting for ~ 6.9:1.  7.8:1 might be OK for the lighter 411/412 sedans,

&gt; &gt;also with a 411/412 engine going into a bus you have to put in a
&gt; electric fuel pump
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I see what you mean.  There's a boss for mounting a mechanical fuel
&gt; pump, but it isn't cut thru the case.  An electric pump for sure.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;also the carbs were different but thats a WHOLE 'nother story!!
&gt; 
&gt; ????   I was just planning on finding a set of 72/73 bus carbs and using

?????  as far as I know all American 411/412 were Fuel injected.... I have
a 71 411 EA series 1700 engine as a back up for my 2 liter engine, I
pulled it from a 411 fastback and it came out with Fuel Injection, and I
use it in my Bus fuel injected  (different fuel injection systems though)

411 fastbacks and 914  have dip stick out the top
411 squarebacks had the dip stick out the rear at 45% angle similar to bus
