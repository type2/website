	As Karl points out, the Bentley manual for breadloafs, 1978
printing (which I have) recomends API Service SE oil and puts an
ambient temp limit of 80F on 20W-50. Your current name-brand oil is
API service SJ, much tougher stuff in the opinion of the oil companies,
VW and most other automakers. But if you want a book to refer to, don't run 
20W-50 when its more than 80F outside.

	If you think oil technology has improved enough in the last 
21 years, you might consider 20W-50. My water-cooled Corrado runs oil
temps around 235-240 on a hot day and a long cruise. For the Corrado's
VR6, VW requires API service rating SF or SG, 15W-40, 15W-50, 20W-40 or 
20W-50 for ambient temps of 104F/40C and above.

	The API ratings tell you something about the quality of
the oil as it ages. Naturally the American Petroleum Institute who
codifys these ratings believes that each new rating is better than
the last.

	What makes a FART keep coming back is discordant facts, as in
this case. Does anyone know what oil service grades and wieghts are
required for the current-build Mexican aircooled beetles or the Brazilian
busses?
