Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cleaning --heat riser tubes-- Intake Manifold

[...]

  Muir has a solution for this. Involves heating the carbon with an
  oxyacetelyne torch until carbon glows. Then shut off the acetelyne
  and blast with oxygen. I've never tried it but it was in the early
  additions of the book. Muir used it on a single port manifold. I
  don't know what would happen on a dual port.

&gt;I've never tried it, but has anyone tried turning the manifold 
&gt;upside down
&gt;and pouring oven cleaner in it?  Then after setting a while, run the 
&gt;clutch
&gt;cable back through it.  Who knows, it might work.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The single port intake manifold we removed *from an engine were 
&gt;replacing
&gt;&gt; that was in a bus with 110,000 original miles on it*  was plugged 
&gt;up with
&gt;&gt; carbon where the heat riser tubes come together.
&gt;&gt; Tried running a piece of old clutch cable through that you attach 
&gt;to a high
&gt;&gt; speed air tool method.  What a PITA that was.  Finally broke down, 
&gt;and
&gt;&gt; bought a used manifold that was clear, from: www.interstatevw_dot_com  
&gt;for big
&gt;&gt; $$$.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The question is: Does anyone know of a special reaming tool that  
&gt;could be
&gt;&gt; purchase to do this that would be a little safer, and more 
&gt;efficient.
