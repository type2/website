&gt;Does the valve respond to manifold
&gt;vacuum? Does an engine run better,
&gt;stronger, hotter when the filter is
&gt;clogged (no flow) or the valve is stuck?
&gt;Does it stick open or shut generally?
&gt;I'd be interested to know.  I should say that
&gt;here in California it is still Friday (11:00 PM).

It behaves the same regardless of the day of the week.  :-)

Theoretically, EGR filters need to be replaced when they become clogged
up, and VW apparently decided that would be at around 30,000 miles. 
However, my experience has been that, at least here in the northeast,
they rust and decompose and rot away before 30,000 miles.

I don't believe that there is anything in the EGR filter other than a
filter media - probably of a metal wool type of substance.  But I don't
know because, as John observed, they rust out.  I blocked off my EGR
system years ago, before ever becoming curious about anything but the
cost of the damned filters.  So I've never had the opportunity to gut
one.

As I undertand it, the purpose of EGR is to dilute the air/fuel mixture
with oxygen-poor exhaust gases to lower the combustion chamber
temperature, because excessive combustion chamber temperature creates
NOx.  Additionally, it may reduce unburned hydrocarbons by giving some
of them another pass through the combustion cycle, but I don't believe
that is a primary expectation of the system.  As far as &quot;filtering&quot;, I
suspect that it's a gross process, for the purpose of preventing globs
and gobs of unburned HC from piling up inside the tube leading to the
valve, and the valve itself.

When the EGR valve opens, and how it does so, varies depending upon the
vehicle.   On my '78 bus, it is purely a mechanical linkage.  The EGR
valve is tied to the throttle valve with an adjustable rod.  It is
adjusted such that the EGR valve is closed at idle and closed at full
(wide open) throttle.  The innards of the EGR valve are something like a
double poppet valve, closing off the passage at either end of the
operating arm's range of movement.

When the filter is clogged (or the valve rendered inoperative, or the
tube blocked off) the engine will theoretically run hotter but produce
more power, since all of the air in the air/fuel mixture would be
atmospheric.

It is very unlikely that an EGR valve would stick, open or closed.  It
is spring loaded, and would probably stick as a result of some external
mechanical fault in the operating mechanism than due to any internal
failure of the valve.

Failure of the EGR valve is very much like failure of the other poppet
valves in your engine.  In my bus, the double poppet inside the valve is
made of stainless steel.  However, the body of the valve, integral to
which are the valve seating surfaces, is a corrodible casting.  What
happens is that the valve seating surfaces become corroded and/or
deposits of unburned HCs accumulate there.  The result is exhaust gas
being admitted to the intake air distributor when it should not be -
most notably at idle, causing a rough idle.  Failure (leakage) of the
valve at wide open throttle is a bit more difficult to discern.

I'll put a picture of the pieces of an EGR valve on my web site at:

    http://mh005.infi_dot_net/~gkucsma/egrv.html

in case anyone is curious.  No book/manual that I am aware of gives any
exploded view of the valve.
