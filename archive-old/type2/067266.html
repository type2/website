Subject: list commands

Hi everybody
        I lost my list of commands for the list a while back in a hd crash.
I'm looking for them now and was wondering if anyone knows where i can get
them from? I also need them for the vanagon list also. One last thing how
many other lists are there for vw's or are these it.

Thanks in advance
