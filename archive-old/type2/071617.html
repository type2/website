I've got a couple of vanagon items to get out of the basement. One is a
vanagon seat with armrests in good condition which I believe will fit the bus
as well. It's in the light brown fabric and I suspect it was originally a
&quot;jump seat&quot; since there is no provision for a headrest. I bought it off the
list a couple of years ago paying way too much and have had it in the basement
since replacing the interior on my 81 with that from an 89. I'd like $50 for
it and frankly shipping it would probably be a pain and at least $20 so it
would make sense to be in the Atlanta area if you have an interest.

Also, the 89 donor vehicle was a multivan with the full width Zbed which I
skinned to reupholster my 81's bed. I therefore have the full width plywood
bed and hinges if someone would like them at $25. This could make sense for
someone with a plain vanagon in search of a folding bed/seat or for anyone
else in search of hinges. The hinges seem more substantial than the version on
my 81 but would interchange. No way the plywoodbed ships although the hinges
could be pulled and shipped for maybe $15.
