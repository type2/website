Santa flew by last night in his sleigh (and a couple of days earlier
in a big brown truck) and left some nice stuff under the tree.

From Marie, I received the &quot;Small Wonder&quot; VW history book and the
Russek pocket mechanic book for our bus.  Also under the tree were the
Hoover Sermons CD and a complete German exhaust system from Bus Depot.

I haven't had a chance to look at the CD yet, as our daughters seem to
be hogging the computer with new games.

Spent the day installing the stereo that Santa brought for out Bug. 
Managed to do the whole thing and only drill _one_ 3/8 hole in the body!

In this holiday season I'd like to once again thank the wonderful
volks who keep our lists and web site going.  The problem with the
jobs that Steve, Thom, and Ken perform, is that if they do their jobs
right we don't even notice them and indeed we don't!  Still, the work
that they do to keep us happy is priceless!

I'd also like to thank the hundreds of contributors that keep these
forums flowing.  Between all of us, we know more about our buses than
VW ever did!  Keep up the good work that keeps our buses on the road!

May the new year bring us many happy miles!

Happy Holidays from the Lyles: 
George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
