Subject: vredestein tires

'What &quot;C&quot; rate tires have people been able to find recently?
'
Last week I ordered a pair of Vredestein COMTRAC '185R14C R' reinforced
sidewall van tires.  $94 ea plus shipping from NJ, there is a guy there who
is the main importer for the east coast.  they are Dutch tires.  load range
D, 1900 lbs.  I haven't got them mounted but they are sitting on my porch
and they are beautiful.  I think they just might be the ticket.  With a
type2 group purchase I think we ought to be able to negotiate a better
price.  Pmail me if you want a photo of these tires.
