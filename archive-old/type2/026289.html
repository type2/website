Subject: Oil Pan Cooler - 76 Bus
Date: Wed, 18 Jul 2001 13:31:38 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello List!

	I've got a 76 Bus (her name is twinkie), and had heard a rumor that
there was some type of aftermarket oil pan that I could get that drastically
decreased my oil temperature, and was a really really good idea.

	If such a product (or something very similiar and I'm just
referencing it incorrectly), I was wondering:

a) Where do I get it?
b) Is it something I should install myself, or take it to the shop?

	I do most of the more basic work myself, but it might be over my
head if it's crazy difficult.

Thanks guys!

Eric Kaufman
