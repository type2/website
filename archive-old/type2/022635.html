Hi Volks,  
    where does  one start on something as sad as kristen's death.  I'm the 
AIRS  member  who fixed her bus last wedsday  night. She called me at my shop 
at 5 pm 
broken down about 60 miles away. She had AAA towing and made it to my shop at 
about 6pm with a major problem, her flywheel had come off.   I was supose to 
go to my pottery class but i skipped it to try to get her on her way again .  
Upon removing the motor  the flywheel stayed in the bellhousing.  Lucky i had 
another one and the replacment dowels ,driiled the crank ,reset the end 
play,somebody had put in 4 shims ,tapped the crank , retorgued the gland nut 
,reinstalled the motor. Upon checking the timing ,dwell, carb, I found the 
timing at 20 degrees at idle . I reset the timing and tried to adjust the 
carb that somebody in penn. had sold her. It was  a piece of junk and I 
adjusted the best I could. It now was pushing 9:30pm  and I was dog tired 
after a full day's work and then some. The bus ran good but had idling pbs.   
I offered Kristin a place to camp but she wanted to get on the road as she 
had a house in cal. I told her that it wasn't a good idea to be going alone 
and printed the AIRS list from va. to az. for her. After telling her to be 
careful and to call uncle jerry in az. just to say hi. she hit the road.   
The next day she called to tell me that the bus ran ok , didn't leak any oil 
but had idle pb.Again I told her to be carefull and to call me if        
she had pbs. This was the last I heard from her.  I wish now that I had told 
her to go back home.As she was getting ready to leave she asked if she could 
pay me, I told her that I do this for a living,but that don't try to make a 
living off of people travling,      
She gave me $100.00 and asked if it was enough, I replied that was fine.I 
followed her to the interstate and beeped from my 66 westy as she left. After 
hearing of her death today I felt the need to tell somebody about meeting her 
and her 2 great dogs  and how sad this was.
