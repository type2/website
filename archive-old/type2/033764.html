&gt; I was told that the large numbers near the top corner of the camper
&gt; is the
&gt; ID number.. so if you see a &quot;friend&quot; you can log the number, date and
&gt; location,,, ,, and, well, I don't know what for,, but i guess so that
&gt; if you
&gt; meet up you can see how many times you've passed each other,,

The Winnebago folk copped that idea from the Airstream folk, who have
been doing the same thing since at least the '40s.  The numbers on
Airstreams signify membership in the Wally Byam (sp?) Caravan Club
International, named after the designer of the Airstream trailer.

Doing this for bus folk does seem to be a good idea, but I doubt that
it would catch on like the Airstream folk.  Bus folk seem to be a lot
more independent, and most bus folk remain ignorant of the list despite
our best efforts to enlighten them.  I've lost count of the bus people
that I've told about the list, but only a couple have actually joined.

&gt; I was wondering if that would be able to apply here,, I have a Type 2
&gt; Sticker on my Camper ,, not to easy to pick out on the road tho,, but
&gt; lots
&gt; of people notice it at the shows
&gt; So i guess i am suggesting that We put a &quot;sign&quot; on the bus.....
&gt; 1 idea I had was to &quot;label&quot; buses in a boat tradition,,, All buses
&gt; have a
&gt; name.. So why not put the name on the back window,, for example,,
&gt; or,,, put a registry number on the front passenger side
&gt; windshield,,,,

To be visible to passing buses, the numbers would have to be at least 3
inches high and located on both the front and back of the buses.  Many
people are loathe to put stickers on their paint, so the glass is the
only place they can go.  High on the windshield seems to be the best
place, except that some of us tall folk actually look through that part
of the windshield!  The bottom of the rear window is also possible and
reasonably out of the way.

We could also go the &quot;second license plate&quot; route, as has the Family
Motor Coach Association.  Perhaps some kewl black-on-white oval plates
sort of like those that used to be used in der Fatherland.

Perhaps this could be tied in with AIRS.  What do the AIRS folks think?

&gt; Just my Ramblin's ,, but Look for My Bus to be &quot;labelled&quot; in 2000,,
&gt;  Back window will read:
&gt; (indian nick name first,, as in Kevin Costner movie fashion, then
&gt; real
&gt; name, )
&gt; 
&gt; Dances with Wind
&gt; &quot;Watermelon&quot;
&gt; CB ch 19 / 24
&gt; Rivers Family
&gt; Galt, Ontario
&gt; Canada

Gee, with all that on your back window, how will you see out?  :)
