Subject: Re: Axle Nut

&gt;
&gt; Since nobody else has posted this, I will have to get off my butt and save
&gt; newbies from buying an expensive socket and breaker bar.  The way to save
money
&gt; and do rear axle nuts off and on for the owner is the tool available in
most vw
&gt; parts shops that is just a very heavy gauge piece of forged metal with the
nut
&gt; hole in it and a dogleg about eight inches out to bang with a sledge
hammer on
&gt; the thing.

However this method will result in the newbie having fun replacing rear
wheel bearings :-(
I'd use the &quot;poundimiform&quot; for emergencies but not on a regular basis.


&gt;Any 46 mm socket you buy will cost much more and assumes you have a
&gt; big breaker bar.  It is likely you will not use it more than once every
three
&gt; years, so you could rent those things (hassle city) or about $10 you buy
this
&gt; tool (yes you will need it again someday, you have the buses that last
forever
&gt; but have a tendency to require attention on those back drums) and use a
sledge
&gt; hammer.  You can justify buying one of those on rational, non-vw grounds
or
&gt; borrow one from the nearest neighbor.
&gt;

If you're gonna have the Bus forever, might as well buy the socket :-)
46mm socket has no other use on a Bus except the rear axle nuts.  However
it's always good to have a breaker bar and a 6-ft iron cheater pipe is
cheap.  Helps when those lug nuts are nice and rusty.

&gt; We long-term bus home mechanics already have this socket to do the
flywheel nut
&gt; on the motor, it's the same size at least for all type I/II motors up to
1971.
&gt; If you know someday you will want to change a flywheel, buy the socket and
a
&gt; breaker bar and don't try to just adapt the size down to a smaller drive
bar, it
&gt; will break.

The socket for a Type 1 engine flywheel nut is 36mm and I think up until the
advent of the Type 4 engine for the Bus the rear axle nut on a Bus is 36mm
too (maybe?  It is on Beetles, Ghias, etc.)  Somewhere around that early bay
time they switched to the 46mm axle nut but at the same time (maybe again?)
switched to the composite drums, so that you can do a rear brake job without
removing the axle nut.

If you are just buying this stuff I would go for 3/4&quot; drive for all of it,
36mm or 46mm.  You can sometimes get away with 1/2&quot; drive for the 36mm but
the way that breaker bar bends, I would recommend something a little
stouter.

As always, YMMV.
