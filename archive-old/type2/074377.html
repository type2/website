all of the gas heaters I have seen warn about using in line blowers.

maybe to prevent unburned gasses from being ignited????

&gt; I know some of you have tried the bilge blowers out and are impressed with
&gt; the volume of air they deliver.  I thought I had saved a few of the posts so
&gt; I could order one and give it a try (I try to be open to new ideas).
&gt; 
&gt; I have a gas heater ready to install, but thought it would be nice to have
&gt; numerous options for heat for those &quot;marginal&quot; days when I could save the
&gt; gas heater and use the stock heat with an extra boost.
&gt; 
&gt; But I now cannot find the emails I thought I had saved.  For those of you
&gt; that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would you please send me a
&gt; source for them so I can order one?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
