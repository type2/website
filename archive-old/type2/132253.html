Hackers piss me off. I don't object to anything that is well thought out,
well executed, generally well done. The reason I dislike most water-cooled
VW busses is because they are hack jobs, not because they are &quot;impure&quot;.

Just because the bus is owned by someone else doesn't mean I can't hate it,
in the same way that if someone does a really nice job on their vehicle, we
can appreciate it.
