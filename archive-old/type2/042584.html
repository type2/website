Subject: CV Joints

Glen asks:

&gt;
&gt; Question....  are all the CV joints the same..in other words can I take the
&gt; right side CV joint(wheel end) from donor bus  and use it on the left tranny
&gt; side  of other bus??????

Simon answers:

&gt;
&gt; If you are using the used parts, why not leave the joints on the driveshafts
&gt; and just swap the whole assembly over. That way, if the joints are OK, you
&gt; should get away with repacking with grease.

I'll second that answer.  I recently switched transmissions and renewed CV joint boots in the
process, so I had the axle shafts off.  Back on the road, there was this bad, dashboard-rattling
vibration when accelerating in third and fourth at certain speeds.  Some kind of harmonic.  Was it
the &quot;new&quot; junkyard transmission?  Then I thought--did I mix up those axle shafts from right to
left, and are the old CV joints accustomed to going in one direction, and maybe don't like being
turned around?  So I switched the shafts from side to side, and sure enough the vibration was gone.

This is by no means conclusive--could be that there were unbalances of shafts, flanges or joints
that just happened to synergize into a harmonic that was accidently cured just by changing things
this way or that.  But I think I will keep all used joints going in the same direction from now on.
