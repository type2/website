Subject: Front Turn Signals, early splits

I've been looking at various pictures
of early splits on the web, and have noticed
a couple that have no visible turn signals.

I have also seen busses with what appears to
be a turn signal lamp housed within the regular
headlight housing.  One person I talked to got
fed up with not finding parts, so welded holes
up and installed turns within headlights.

Did some early busses have NO separate turn
signals, and only the had contained-within-the headlight
version?  Or are ALL busses with missing turn
signals a customized feature?

Found an early split FS, no text,  just a photo and an
email address.  Photo shows a corner window Deluxe, 
with no turnsignals up front, so dating is difficult,
other than pre '64.  Have sent email, but no reply yet.
