Subject: Re: Anybody Having Success Contacting BusBoys?

&gt;Is anybody else having difficulty reaching BusBoys, or am I being singled
&gt;out for special treatment?  They don't respond to Emails clearly titled
&gt;&quot;Placing an Order&quot; and their 800 phone number is constantly busy -- perhaps
&gt;off the hook?

I tried emailing for a price quote early last week and still haven't heard
back.  I guess they're still too busy trying to figure out their taxes so
they don't have enough time to take orders to make money to pay their taxes.
