Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

A few people have suggested Boston Bob or Jake Raby (and secretly I have
wished for one of their engines anyway).

Well I called Boston Bob and he is very helpful. Being a master of these
engines he explained that my single weber carb is killing my engine. A new
engine from him with new heads and all would be about $2700. This is for a
2000cc engine with hydraulic lifters. Also he doesn't give a warranty for an
engine with the weber carb on it. He reccomends pulling the engine from a
78/79 with the FI, gas tank and tranny and retrofitting it on my new engine.
At the least I would need new dual carbs for a warranty. (I tried very hard
not to misquote, if I did I am sorry). We are talking about $3000 without an
install from a reputable mechanic (not me) to make my company happy and pay
for it. I just can't afford it.

James Garrison and Richard Palmer both recommend Transporterwerks up in
Raliegh, about 2 hours away. I called and the owner is away so no pricing
but they can install me an AVP engine that they back and recommend or
rebuild my engine and they do rebuild these engines frequently. If I can
afford it I will have them rebuild my engine. If not then its the AVP.

One thing I have had 2 people tell me is that I should look for some Delorto
dual carbs. Does anyone have these? I would have to go with the dual weber
carbs otherwise. There is also fuel injection. Can I put fuel injection on a
73? (boy I bet that is gonna bring a lot of emails)

Thanks to all who have helped. I have only pulled out half my hair today.

&gt;
&gt; With 2,000 you should buy a motor from Boston Bob, have it shipped, pay
&gt; your mechanic to install it and follow Bob's advice on break in. I would
&gt; not trust a motor from anyone other than him or Jake. Go to Bob's website
&gt; and price it out yourself. I think his longblocks are around $1500. Jake
&gt; could probably make you a more powerful motor but I am a fan of stock
&gt; stuff.

&gt; (Well I hate to be the one to post this, because I am sure it comes up
&gt; pretty frequently. I looked at the archives, but there is so much it would
&gt; take a while to decipher it all)
&gt;
&gt; I am lucky enough that my Xmas bonus last year is $2000 towards replacing
&gt; my engine. Its a 1700cc with 166 000 original miles. Never rebuilt.
&gt; Apparently has bad rings and &quot;blow by&quot; because it pops every seal I
&gt; replace. There is nothing I would like more than doing it myself, but
&gt; because the company is paying for it they require I have somebody with
&gt; experience do the engine, so if something goes wrong I can take it back. I
&gt; will have my girlfriend smack me for being so lucky!!
&gt;
&gt; My question is should I:
&gt;
&gt; 1)  buy an AVP engine (or another rebuilder) and have it installed by my
&gt; mechanic who works on foreign cars in general, but could probably install
&gt; it and get it running correctly. Approximate cost of AVP engine is $1200
&gt; for a long block. I have heard good and bad things about AVP. I know not
to
&gt; buy GEX.
&gt;
&gt; 2) try to buy a spanking new engine (not sure the cost on that or the best
&gt; sources) and have my mechanic install it. Keep in mind I only have about
&gt; 2000 bucks (smack) but I plan to keep my bus &quot;forever&quot; and drive it on
long
&gt; trips.
&gt;
&gt; 3) have my mechanic do the rebuild on my engine. He says he can do it, but
&gt; he doesn't rebuild pancake engines very much at all. He also said it could
&gt; be up to $2500 or $2800 with new pistons and everything. Said we would
have
&gt; to tear it down to know for sure, which sounds right. I would rather have
&gt; as much new stuff as possible, but have heard some say newer stuff is
worse
&gt; than the original stuff.
&gt;
&gt; What things should I make sure I get new? What other things should I ask?
&gt; As far as I know there is noone else here in Charlotte, NC that rebuilds
&gt; the pancake engine frequently like a Boston Bob or Jake Raby.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any input. I have started researching some, but a big check
just
&gt; came in so I better put my bus in the shop now while the money is
&gt; available.
