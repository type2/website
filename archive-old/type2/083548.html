Subject: distributor question...again!

--=====================_889472414==_

Hi Class...i have several question for u all. and i'll brake them down to a couple different posts here. 
first off, i have 70westie w/a 1600dp and i'm trying to replace my 009 distributor for a vaccuum advance type. 
i recently recieved a 010 which has a vaccuum and centrifugal advance. i know it's not the correct distributor for this year and type but i was told that i could go ahead and use it. BUT...when i tried to put her in yesterday, settin my engine at TDC#1, i found that my offset on the shaft is 180 off. is this why i can't use this type. or is there a way that i can?.?.?
thanks for any help that u can pass my way. and sorry for my ignorance. i'm tryin to learn and retain as i go. thanks again for your patience. and a gr8ful peace out to you and yours. *shine on* -Chris in E.Oregon
