&gt;On 
&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;Problem #2 
&gt;&gt;   After driving long distances (200+ miles), the van will 
&gt;fail to start
&gt;&gt;   once the ignition is turned off.  I thought my starter 
&gt;may be getting
&gt;&gt;   too hot and tripping a &quot;breaker&quot; so I ran a wire 
&gt;directly from my
&gt;&gt;   battery to the starter.  The wire is connected to the 
&gt;starter and
&gt;&gt;   dangles loose near the battery.  When it will not start 
&gt;I have to use
&gt;&gt;   my&quot;hot wire&quot; to get it going how can this problem be 
&gt;fixed? Why does it
&gt;&gt;   occur? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have occasionaly experienced this on my 65' bus do people 
&gt;think think is attributable to a faulty ignition, I have not 
&gt;tried the hot wire sol'n yet.

I believe the Muir bible has a good rap on installing a solenoid
that will give you extra juice on start only. Pretty easy to do,
if I recall correctly.
