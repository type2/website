Subject: Engine wiring in a 72 bus

Hey all,

A guy named Ernie got my number off the AIRS list and is looking for 
help with wiring a 76 2.0l engine into a 72 bus. He has the engine in, 
but wants to make sure he has the wiring correct before trying to fire 
anything over. He is using a single Weber carb. My bus is in storage, 
so I can't give him help. If anyone can give him instructions, please 
call him at 207.457.3067 evening, 207.432.5608 day, or reply back to me 
and I will get him the info. He is hoping to have it up and running for 
Buses by the Buoy this weekend.

Thanks in advance,

Ned Savoie
