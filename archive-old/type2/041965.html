Subject: Re: stuff for sale: ... mosquito screen

&gt; I have a few things for sale.  All came out of my 1978 Westfalia Deluxe
&gt; Camper.
&gt; Rear Mosquito Screen (Like New Condition)

FWIW, there are at least two different snap patterns on these, and I
don't know what the years are.  I have two screens, one in poor shape
that is correct for my '71, another in great shape but the snaps don't
all match.

It's not a big deal, as enough of them match that you can get a pretty
bugproof seal, just something to consider when trying to get one for
your bus.  Anyone care to post a typology of rear mosquito screens?

Speaking of screens, I finally got around to replacing my old rotten
poptop canvas will nothing but windowscreen.  Took a couple of hours max
and maybe $20 in materials (screen and staples -- not counting the cost
of a staple gun).  Looks really nice, almost invisible.  I used black
vinyl screening.  Only drawbacks are cold and rain, but I have an
over-tarp that covers the poptop and side tent for the former.  For the
latter, well, I'm in Tallahassee.
