  Hey There!
I'm looking for the above seat for 73 Westy in yellow .
The PO removed it and installed a homemade stove.
I've removed said stove and would like to safely carry another person
(kid) in the back.  The camp stool is strapped to the sink cabinet to a
small clip.........is this correct? Not good for carrying someone!
     If anyone knows of this seat please let me know...........I'm near
London Ontario Canada.and would like to find one near home.
Pmail please,

Phil Gowdy
73 Westy (The contraption)
