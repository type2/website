&gt; List,
&gt; I haven't had the time to fully research the archives,
&gt; but I have a quick question about the heater blower.
&gt; Is there a trigger than turns that fan on/off or is it
&gt; designed to run when the engine is running?  This is
&gt; for my '72 Westy.

Hi,
Assuming your '72 is the same as my '78 (dangerous assumption but can't be
bothered to get the wiring diagrams out!), there is a contact on the heat
control lever.  When the lever gets near the bottom of its travel, the
contact grounds a wire, which operates the relay just above the fan and
turns it on.
