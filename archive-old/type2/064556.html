&gt; Does anyone remember when Homer made a pact with the devil (played by Ned
&gt; Flanders) and his head turned into a giant pink frosted donut? &quot;Bart! stop
&gt; picking at your father's head.&quot;

  Yes!  And then my man Homer is sent to hell and is forced to eat all the 
donuts in the entire world, which he promptly does.  The line was, &quot;James Coco 
went mad after ten minutes.&quot;
