Subject: Spring vs Non-spring Clutch disks

Greetings to all and sundry....

Dropped the engine to get to the clutch/pressure plate problem today.
Sure enough, the ends of the teeth on the diaphragm-type pressure
plate were real worn, with a couple of them actually broken off.

Went out to get replacement parts, and figured I'd get a clutch
(driven plate) as well, since the one that's in there is probably
close to 5 years old. The replacement I got (korean) has little springs
running concentric to the hub (that is, not radially, but the other way).
The old one (Sachs Brazil, I think -- Brasilian, anyway) does not -- just
rivets around the hub.

Any difference? Ok to use either type? The old one looks surprisingly
good, btw...not visibly thinner than the new one. Are they all supposed to
have radial grooves when they're new? The old one doesn't, but it came
with the rebuilt engine 5 years ago, so I don't know if it did or not.
If they are all supposed to have them, and they're a wear indicator, then
the old one is shot. :)

If anyone has any spare positive karma, shoot some this way -- I'm fighting
off some general depression, and am not really psyched for the never-ending
battle against entropy right now.

Cheers

'71 Campmobile
