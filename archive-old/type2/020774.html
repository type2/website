&gt;    I've got the camping interior out of our 71 westy to repalce the wood and
&gt; linoleum floor.  No doubt about it, this is going to snowball into more than
&gt; just a floor, but that's OK.

Yep.  I just did that.  Found LOTSA RUST!

&gt; Once there is a new floor and new wood on the
&gt; lower part of the walls, I'd hate to put the cabinets back in the way they
&gt; are.

As an aside:  I replace mine with 1 layer of shower backer board, 1 layer of
luan door skin and 1 layer of closed cell foam for some sound insulation.
Worked out to be real close to the same thickness. I put the foam down first
followed by the backerboard for water resistance.  Then came the door skin
covered with the self stick vinyl floor tiles.  Looks pretty good for $15 worth
of vinly and scraps I had laying around.  I would tell you to hit the archives
for a good write up but... Use the old pieces as a pattern.  One note.  Be
careful of the cuts for the inboard mounts of the jump seat. If the holes are
too big they will show.

&gt; The formica on them is chipped, cracked, and broken.  I sure would
&gt; like to repair or replace the formica, but don't have a clue to working with
&gt; that kind of stuff.
&gt;    Can anyone recommend a book, web site, or other refrence for working with
&gt; laminates like that?   First hand advice would be great too.

Working with formica is not too difficult. You'll need something to rough cut it
with: table or circular saw, contact cement, spacers, and a router with a flush
cut bit and maybe a file for touchup AND appropriate safety gear.  There's a
special small router available for laminate trimming.  I've seen them in pawn
shops for as little as $15, sometimes with the bit.

You'll probably need to remove the plastic T moulding and other trim stuff
first.  Start by rough cutting the formica about 1 inch larger than the surface
to be covered on all sides.  Coat both surfaces with contact cement and allow to
dry to the touch.  Use small strips of wood as spacers between the formica and
surface to be covered.  This allows you to line them up.  Remove the spacers one
at a time and press the formica onto the new surface as you go.  Rub it all down
good and hard using a roller or just a piece of wood as a rubbing block.  Then,
fire up the router to trim it flush. The flush cut router bit has a roller
bearing to ride on the surface below the edge so set the depth of the bit
accordingly (this will be clear when you see the bit). Make sure that the
bearing isn't riding on the edge of the plywood with the dado for the T
moulding.  Use the file to clean up edges and corners.  You may want to slightly
chamfer the bottom edges of the cabinets with the file to assure they don't hang
when installing/removing.

Good Luck.
