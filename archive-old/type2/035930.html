Subject: Ordering aircooled parts from the dealer is like...

buying beer when you're 15.  You know, the &quot;I'll take
some chewing gum, these potato chips, a comb, a
six-pack of Busch, and this magazine.&quot;

I usually do something like &quot;I need a window regulator
and a new defroster switch for my Jetta GLX and I
guess I'll take some of those copper washers for the
oil drain bolt in the Westy.&quot; ;)

Last summer the roller bearing in my sliding door died
and I needed to get some replacement parts.  I went to
Ray Burnett VW in Alexandria (now Alexandria VW) and
was told I had to buy the entire door hinge assembly. 
I called Springfield VW and they said it was NLA.  I
called the Type 2 List :&gt; and Bruce Maxson emailed me
this and then faxed me the article: [Let me put in a
plug for LiMBO first, and then tell you that Jim
DiGennaro of LiMBO wrote an article (March-April '99
Transporter) on your very problem and how to fix it,
although from a preventative maintenance point of
view.]  ---Thanks again Bruce!

Anyway, with the part numbers from the article in hand
I went back to Alexandria VW and the parts droid keyed
in the #s and said &quot;Golly!  They are available!&quot; 
Unfortunately the bearing was almost $50.  The plastic
guide was like $5 or so.  The other stuff was a bolt,
washer and nut which was almost nothing.

I didn't bother calling Springfield VW to nag them
about it.  Come to think of it, I ordered a complete
outside mirror for my Jetta last week and they haven't
called me yet...

I actually kept all the little plastic bags that the
sliding door parts came in so if anybody's interested
I'll key all of them in and post it.  Replacement of
said items is pretty easy as long as you don't let the
sliding door fall to the ground.  Don't ask. :(
