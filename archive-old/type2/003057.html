Hmm, for all us UK list members the yawn's come out for all the usual fuel
injection probs. However &quot;Total VW&quot; mag (was flat4) had an article about
installing mechanical fuel injection from a Golf etc... Suggested that fuel
economy was about 28 mpg in town, &amp; _at_ £3.50 a gallon (yes £ not $ or even
pence/cents) it seems a VERY good thing, has any-one had experience of any
non-original injection systems to replace carbs in a 1600 DP upright?
