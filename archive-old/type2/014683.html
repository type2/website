Regarding the burning bus. One idea to limit the size of the fire
 would be to run your fuel pump power through a piece of that 
Safety Kleen meltable wire, or maybe even solder that is strung across
the engine room. That way if a fire gets going it will melt the wire,
killing the 
fuel pump. limiting the size of the fire, cutting off the forced airflow
feeding it, and
informing the owner there is a problem by killing the engine;-)
