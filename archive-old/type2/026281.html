&gt; Hi folks
&gt; (I have re-sent this mail as it didn't appear the first time, if it is
&gt; a   
&gt; duplicate I apologise and will kick my own butt)
&gt; 
&gt; 1972 1600 dual port upright bus. (upright engine not bus, well the bus
&gt; IS   
&gt; upright......oh you know what I mean!!)
&gt; With winter coming on here in the UK, the rebuild process is
&gt; restricted   
&gt; to activities in the workshop so the engine is in bits.
&gt; It's in brilliant condition but as part of the process I 'm going to
&gt; 
&gt; replace the flywheel oil seal...which involves removing the gland   
&gt; nut.....yep, you've guessed it and before anyone says anything, the   
&gt; elephant wasn't heavy enough!!.
&gt; Searching through the archives I came across references to the 'Kymco
&gt; 
&gt; Torque Meister'
&gt; I found them and their tool on the web at:
&gt; http://www.kymcovw_dot_com/Pages/tm.html
&gt; This looks like just the thing to get the job done, I'm quite happy to
&gt; 
&gt; buy one, BUT where from.
&gt; I've mailed em but have had no answer, so I'm asking you folk,   
&gt; particularly any Brits if you know of anywhere I can get one in the
&gt; UK,   
&gt; or failing that how can I get one shipped from the good ole US of A
&gt; and   
&gt; how much would it cost???
&gt; **
&gt; 
&gt; Appreciate your help Dave
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
