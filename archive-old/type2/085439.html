Subject: BN2 Question

I'm trying to put a BN2 into my bus. (I know its a beetle heater, but I have
a beetle engine so its okay) I got it from an  old beetle, in which the
original heater fuel pump was pretty nasty, actually un recognizable would
be a better description.
So before I can make this heater work I need to scratch up a pump of some
sort. I'm tempted to go electric, but I'm unsure of the psi.
Suggestions welcome.

Thanks,
Adam
