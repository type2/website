&gt; &gt;  I took the starter off my parts bus to swap but it seemed to look
&gt; &gt; really different (the engines are both '73), should the starters be
&gt; &gt; interchangeable even though they look different ?

&gt; automatic starters are different,  the Auto starter can be used in most
&gt; manuals but a manual starter cannot be used in an automatic bus

The Auto starter can NOT be used on 2.0 L manuals. It can be used on a 2.0 L
auto trans.
Does one of your starters have a 1/2&quot; blank space between the Sprague clutch
and the pinion teeth?
If yes: this is a 2.0 L manual starter.
The 1.7 and 1.8 starters have no blank section. The pinion teeth meet at the
overrunning clutch. [ btw, that Sprague clutch is also in those turnstiles
like at grocery stores, so you can enter but can't exit ]
