Subject: Westy &quot;roof alignments&quot;

Just out for a 10km walk, and while out there, wondered why the pre-'74
&quot;lids&quot;, opened a different way than the '74 and later?  Was it due to &quot;Westy
management &quot;showing they knew better, than VW or was it by &quot;kitchen &quot;design,
below, or just &quot;design&quot; change, because I believe at that time of production
VW was going through a &quot;management issue&quot;, with &quot;Bigger players&quot;, yet they
persist.  There just had to be a reason!!??!!??
