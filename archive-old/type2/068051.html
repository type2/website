Subject: Re: Selling CA Bus out of state???

Ivan said:

  Anyhow my main question is....are there any special procedures to selling a
vehicle from one state to a person in another?  i.e. Do I need a smog
certificate from CA before selling it, what paperwork is necessary, etc.  Any
help would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

California requires a smog certificate to register a car in California, not
to sell it out of state.   I bought a bus in California, and sold it to a
friend here in Washington.  Washington state law requires an inspection when
registering a previously out of state car in this state.   Make sure the
title numbers match the bus' numbers.    Thurston county does not require a
smog certificate to transfer title, so we didn't have to worry about that.
