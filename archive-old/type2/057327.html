Subject: Solex PSDIT32 Carb....hoses!

I have a '73 bus, too, with a mess of hoses.  Recently I asked the same
hose routing question on this list and got flamed twice and a &quot;Check the
archive&quot;.  After investing about 6 hours on the archive previous to
posting, I just went to a nearby import shop and the guy drew me a
diagram.  Here goes.

The two dizzy vacuum can connections go to the left carb.  You'll notice
that each connection on the dizzy is a different size.  So are the two
connections on the carb, match the up, bigger &lt;-&gt; bigger, smaller &lt;-&gt;
smaller(I always use hose clamps on the smaller one, I can't get hose
that small in Northern Idaho).  

The vacuum connection on the right side carb may have at one time gone to
something but all that I have seen have been capped off.  I think it is
for tuning.

As for that switch on the ceiling of the engine compartment.  Leave it
alone.  Everyone i know that has one of these has disconnected it and
found that they get better performance.  That switch only lets the carb
advance in fourth gear I believe.  Maybe it was for smog control or
something.  Here's how to hook it up if you really want it.

The advance from the dizzy, thats the connection on the rounded side away
from the dizzy, goes to the switch on the same side the electrical
connections are on.  Then the advance on the left carb hooks to the other
connection on the switch.  Make sense?  I hope so.
