Subject: Retreat hell! We're just advancing in a different direction!

I thought about my post to Thom a bit more - ok, so even if Thom STOPS
buying NOS bumper overriders for a few years, its doubtful even the
best-paid programmer jock can just whip out the pocketbook and make a cdrom
like the one we would like to see... because of LICENSING FEES. As someone
who tried to get unreleased Captain Beefheart tapes licensed to me for a
project, I can tell you that it ain't cheap; the company I talked to wanted
$15000 up front, percentages, and a guaranteed sales figure. So, unless we
just want this thing to be filled with folklore (ie, this List, homepages,
etc), we would need to contact VW, Clymer, Bentley, Berg, etc. I bet they'd
be happy to cooperate. For a price. And I'm betting that is why Thom's
company does market research before they launch a product; can we PAY for
the licensing fees byselling enough of these damn things?
   Apparently, Thom's company doesn't think so. But I bet that company has
a competitor... and I bet if a certain someone were to *forward* all the
mail regarding a VW cdrom to that competitor (casually mentioning that &quot;we
weren't interested, small potatoes for us&quot;), SOMEONE might get it done ;)
'Course, once that OTHER outfit has plans to do one, Thom can drop a remark
to the marketing geeks  about hearing that &quot;X&quot; company is going ahead with
an aircooled cdrom. Bet *that* gets things going!
