Hello,

I'm relatively new to all this so please excuse my ignorance.  I have a
78 bus and recently I have been smelling a lot of gas when I fill up. 
I noticed it dripping the last fill.  From ideas what it may be from
the archives, I opened up the panel and discovered one of the two
yellow lines was undone from the elbow peice going in the tank.  This I
feel was the problem, but what are these lines and am I correct in
thinking this indeed is the solution.
Thanks alot,
Tim Pries
