Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder?

Seth,

Indeed, easier to get a new one than rebuild.

Lots of work on the rebuild and lots of parts inspection and
and measurement....honing of the cylinder if necessary.

Extra care must be taken to get the piston and all seals
back in the cylinder without tearing.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Has anyone ever tried to rebuild there own master cylinder? I was going to 
&gt; attempt to rebuild the one for my project bus but the only rebuild kit (VW 
&gt; dealer) was almost as much as an already rebuilt one. Any clues on where to 
&gt; look for a kit? I'm really not sure if that is a normal price for a rebuild kit 
&gt; or not.
