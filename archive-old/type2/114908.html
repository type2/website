Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

Hi Terry,

Why? Same reason that Doktor Tim doesn't use Marvel Mystery Oil.

POR-15 is a hobbyists tool, just like MMO.

Pro's make repairing metal and coating it. Changing to a POR-15 
oriented process doesn't fit well in their business model, particularly 
when considering the warranty aspects.

I used Mar-Hyde's &quot;One-Step&quot; extensively on the pitted areas of my bus 
before I had Maaco paint it and not a single pit has resurfaced in the 
3.5 years since. Considering how most Maaco paint-work turns out, I 
think it did OK. YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
