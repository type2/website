Subject: FREE Vanagon heat exchangers in MI
Mime-Version: 1.0

Won them on an *bay auction with a crossover and a muffler I need
but I got no use for the exchangers.  They are there, one looks great
one looks worse, about all I can say.  If anyone is interested I'll email
your name to the seller and see if he will ship them seperately, or if
anyone wants to pick them up you can have em, I'm only paying to
ship what I need.
