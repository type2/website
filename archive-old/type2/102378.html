Subject: RE: [T2] Recomended Gearbox shops.

&gt; I too have used Carter's. I'll second their quality.
&gt;
&gt;  Carter now works at Rancho Performance Transmission. 3 of the top tranny
&gt; builders in the country now work at Rancho


Just a note that all of the Bus Depot rebuilt transmissions are rebuilt by
Rancho Performance, so you can order them through us as well. They're on the
website.
