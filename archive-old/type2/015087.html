&gt;Here's what wasn't done that they said needed to be: Tie Rod Ends, Outer
&gt;Axle Boot - right rear, front brake pads, front shocks, rear brake
&gt;adjusters and screws.  Oh and the replacing of the carbs (they said it
&gt;wasn't imperative at this moment but that I should really think about it).

First, never apologize for ignorance, unless it's willfull. Secondly,
here's my list of what you should do, in order. (1)Brake pads. Dead simple,
and hard to go wrong. Anyone who knows anything can help. (2) Front shocks.
Same time as the pads, while the wheels are off. (3) Tie rod ends. If you
can get them cheaply, and you've got time, do them same time as the above.
If not, do them later. (4) Axle boot. That's tougher. You need experienced
help for that. (5) Brake adjusters. Mmmm. You may have to have that done.
Carbs - forgeddit, unless you're down to 15 MPG.
Good luck.
Ian Cameron
