Subject: Re: [T2] It's 80 degrees here in SoCal!

40?!?!?!

30wt baybee! This warm weather won't last more than a few days. 

I thought running the positive cable to the starter would be a
nightmare. Nope. Easy as pie. (mmmm... had mincemeat pie today...
mmmm) Nice heavy wire pretty much holds whatever shape you give it. So
I was able to make it straight, stick a flashlight to light up the
crossmember just forward of the starter, and pushed the cable through
until it hit that crossmember. Crawled underneath, popped it into the
sheetmetal grabber thingie, and bolted it on the starter.

My shoulder's bugging again, so the starter is going to have to wait
until tomorrow. But I'll pull it off and have the FLAPS put it on the
tester to be sure. But I had just the 12v cable attached, disconnected
the ignition wire and the 3 smaller wires on the + terminal of the
starter and attached my remote start switch. Nada. Verified 12v was
getting to the solenoid and that it was grounding. Welp. Sounds like
it's time for a solenoid.

Interesting thing, the CSK (Checker/Schucks/Kragen) website shows the
starter for $49.99 complete with solenoid:

But it shows just the solenoid for $47.99:

Go figure.

&gt; Yes. Let's see some proof: Don putting SAE40 into the engine. :-)
