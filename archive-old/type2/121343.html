&gt;Can you use the  &quot;Slammer Tool For Removing 46mm Axle Nut&quot;  from the

Mine has a square hole for a 1/2&quot; torque wrench/ratchet wrench/breaker bar.

That said, you'd be way better of getting a set of large sockets--they are 
useful for
many things other than the obvious.  When used as a mandrel, in conjunction 
with a
hydraulic press, they can be used for installing wheel bearings.

Note that Harbor Freight has the annoying habit of putting the thing you 
just bought,
on sale at 50% off, three weeks after you order..............

&gt;  I cant seem to find a 46mm socket anywhere.

You just looked in the wrong place.  8o)
