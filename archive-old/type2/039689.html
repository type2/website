Subject: Missin' My 'Loaf

Okay, I'm an ungrateful wretch.  Here Jim goes and buys me a very fine example of an '81 Westfalia, and all I can do is think how I miss my old '68 bus..... The Westy looks sharp, runs fine, but it's just too complex compared to the '68 (sensors, injectors, pollution control stuff, etc.).  I miss the simplicity of the 1500/1600....  The '68 felt lighter, more agile, shifted nicer (not so mushy feeling)--granted the ride was a lot less smooth (though I thought of it  as having a good feel for the road) and the brakes were piss-poor (could have been better with work, though), but it took itself less seriously.  Well if a nice '68-'71 with as little rust as the Westy comes along, we might have to have his and hers buses!  Don't tell Jim.... he loves his new Westy.... Maybe I'll grow more attached with time... After all, I did have about 150,000 miles in the old '68, while I have about 25 in the new one....
