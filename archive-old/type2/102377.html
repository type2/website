Good job. With some simple tools &amp; encouragement (especially from this
list since wifes usually don't say too much good things :) you can
easily keep your bus maintained. 

&gt; can anyone reccomend any books that would be helpful?
&gt; i bought the vw book for the 79 transporter(ordered it
&gt; yesterday on amazon) anyone?

Which vw book? The Bentley is by far the most indepth publication,
although if your not used to reading mechanical manuals it seems a bit
wordy. The Haynes &amp; the Muir tend to help fill in the missing bits for
the novice.
