Subject: [T2] Light Assembly Refubish

I have a process for restoring reflective surfaces and rust proofing tail
light assemblies.
The process should be good for ten to twenty years.
The coating is the same as used on CeramKrome headers and is rated at 1500
degrees temp.
The coating can be hand polished using Never Dull / Mothers or other non
abrasive cleaners and polishes.
The finish as it comes from out vibratory polisher looks very much like the
finish you'd find on polished aluminum wheels.
It's not quite as reflective as the OEM mirror finish behind headlights but
is sufficient to save your tail lights from farther decay and enhance the
illumination considerably.
