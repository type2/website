I calculated that going from regular to synthetic oil would cost much less 
than filling the tank with premium instead of regular over 3,000 miles, 
which many on this list say they do.  In that 3,000 miles you've spent $200 
or more for gas - is an extra $10 for synthetic at oil change time really 
significant?  Not to me, and I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination.

Assumptions:

20mpg
$1.35/gallon regular
$1.50/gallon premium
3000 miles per oil change
Type 1 engine with sub 3-quart oil change
Dino oil $1.50/quart
Synthetic oil $5.00/quart

That makes $22.50 extra for running premium vs.  $10.50 extra for synthetic 
vs. regular oil.  Does anyone still think they can't afford it?
