I didn't see where you adjusted your rear shoes before you started this
procedure to bleed them

If the wheel cylinders have to move out too far, the pedal will be lower.

You can check this easily,, pull out your Ebrake, and step in the pedal. did
that do anything to the amount of pedal movement?
does it come out more than 6 clicks?

Make sure the rear shoes are adjusted, and see where you are .

&gt; 74 Westfalia--my brakes used to be &quot;high and tight.&quot; The brake servo is
&gt; bad, so I have to use a lot of oomph. But the brakes seem OK otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT I recently lost about 50% of the pedal. Now I have to push about
&gt; halfway to the floor before I feel any action. The action is still very
&gt; firm, not spongey. In spite of some evidence of leakage on the inside of
&gt; the right rear tire, the brake fluid reservoir is nearly full.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like I have plenty of lining left on the rear brake shoes. The
&gt; front pads are just at the place where they need to be replaced.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried bleeding from the right rear wheel. NOTHING happened when I
&gt; loosened the nipple and had my brakeman (Emma) stomp the pedal. I could
&gt; see some weepage in the threads but no bleeding or leaking when the
&gt; brakes were applied.
