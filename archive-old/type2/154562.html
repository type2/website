Subject: Re: [T2] high octane gas

Robert said:


 &gt;the number on the pumps in the USA is RON + MON divided by 2.

 Yes.  Your 'pump octane number' is the mean of measurements
 at 2 different rpm.
MON is a measure of propensity to pre-ignition at &quot;hi&quot; revs
 -  300 rpm from memory  -  on the single-cyl test engine going back
 to Ricardo who gve us the Ford V8 combustion chamber  '-{
For petrol made from oil, it usually turns out that the MON
is c.10 points below the RON.  For the synthetic petrol made at Sasol
(S. Africa) or  -  1981-c.1993  -  at the Mobil/Bechtel plant in NZ,
the MON turns out to be disastrously lower.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a little problem with advertising and egos with gasoline companies here in the late 60's and early
70's.  If I remember right, Sunoco Blue 260 was claiming to be 104......

So, to protect us from ourselves, the government stepped in and required the M+R/2 formula to keep them from
taking from the MON number and adding to the RON number and come up with bogus ratings. Called CLC
for U.S. Cost of Living Council Octane rating.  I never did figure out what the cost of living has to do with
octane......
