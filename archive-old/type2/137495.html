&lt;&lt; For those who carry a vehicle inside the truck: how do you tie it down? 
Asking, b/c I don't know. The only tie downs I have seen were along the walls 
and suitable for appliances and furniture.

Back when i, and everyone I knew, were immortal we helped a friend move
from upstate NY to Tennessee. U-Haul was out of the smaller truck and
gave us a much bigger one at the same rate. With too much space for
just the furniture and stuff, we backed the truck against a sloping drive
way and drove my buddy's Beetle onboard. A clothesline and a bunch of
nails in the truck's oak floor was the tie-down...Oh, yeah, we set the 
hand brake, too... ;-)
