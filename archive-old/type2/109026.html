October 2003

10th (or is it 9th?) Annual &quot;Kombis on Kelleys&quot;
Join your LEALKOIL friends for our annual camp out on scenic Lake Erie.
Date is October 10-12, 2003 at the 4-H Camp on Kelleys Island.  The ferry
departs for Kelleys Island on the hour, from Marblehead, Ohio.  It's about
an hour east of Toledo, and an hour and a half west of Cleveland.  Please
contact your helpful LEAKOIL representative for 4-H Camp and ferry line fee
schedules.  Activities include bocci ball, the eternal hot dog rolling
machine, a high performance blender, and rental golf cart abuse.  Well
behaved dogs are welcome, but teenaged kids must be leashed at all times.
Limited cabin space is available for the infirm and/ or Single Cab owners.
Be there, or be talked about.
