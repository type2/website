&gt; Question:  Why adjust hydraulic lifters cold?  My only experience is with
&gt; Chevrolet, but I was taught to have the engine running, back the adjustment
&gt; out, until the lifter starts to clatter, turn it back in until it just stops
&gt; making noise.  Wait ten seconds, to verify it is just making contact, stop
&gt; making noise, then turn it in - SLOWLY - 3/4 to 1 1/2 turns, depending on the
&gt; application.  Why would the adjustment be any different on a VW?

Well, for starters, you can get away with it on the chevy with the engine running
because you are adjusting the lifters via the center of the rocker where there is
no movement.  Slip the socket over the nut and tighten/loosen as need be.  Now
with the VW lifters having the adjustment on the end of the rocker arm, you would
have to loosen the retaining nut,  slip a screwdriver on there, adjust it while
its moving???  If you could do that and get anything close to a proper
adjustment, you better sign up for the pro rodeo circuit. ;-))

Happy New Year,

Scott
