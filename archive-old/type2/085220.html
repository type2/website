Subject: RE: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

When I remove type4 motors its been easier to drop the tranny with the motor
and pull them both out,, it is a big pain in the ass to try and get it all
lined up when you just remove the motor  it is much easier to put it back in
with the tranny attached.

well being of the &quot;take only the engine out&quot; school I don''t usually take
out the transmission yoke bolts so I don't support the tranny extra at all 
 
and since I have an automatic my front support is a big flat plate into a
slot, so unless I pull the tranny rearward or unbolt the plate the tranny
isn't going anywhere.  not sure about the manual tranny mounts

Bob

&gt; &gt; If you find that you have to support the tranny on your Type 
&gt; &gt; 4 Bus, you have
&gt; &gt; a serious problem somewhere.  On the Type 4, the tranny is 
&gt; &gt; hung from the
&gt; &gt; chassis at the rear by two big bolts.  No tranny support is 
&gt; &gt; needed, and the
&gt; &gt; transmission does not move when you remove the engine.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; It's not the rear of the tranny that needs support, it's the 
&gt; front (so says Bentley anyway.) My theory was that the engine
&gt; and bearer (and the 2 big bolts) held the tranny in place (and
&gt; correctly aligned) while the engine is in, and removing the 
&gt; engine puts more of the weight of the tranny on the front mount, 
&gt; which may not be designed for that much pressure? 
&gt; 
&gt; I was just following Bentley's recommendation.  I'd love to skip
&gt; that step if it's not needed.  I'm a T2 novice so when I read the
&gt; &quot;make sure to support the front of the tranny&quot; part in Bentley, at
&gt; first I thought &quot;I never had to do this with a Beetle&quot; but then I had
&gt; had visions of my tranny dropping and breaking on the concrete floor
&gt; so I just went along with what the book said.
