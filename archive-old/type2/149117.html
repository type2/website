Subject: Re: [T2] Converting from Weber single carb BACK to Fuel
  Injection?

Hi Mike,

Jason Laster has already chipped in with excellent advice... the only  
thing I'd add is to download the Bosch L-Jetronic Factory manual  
available from www.ratwell_dot_com; and every other manual you can get  
your hands on.

I converted to FI last spring, and for me it has been much easier to  
work with than the dual solex PDSIT carbs I replaced.

Happy trails,

&gt; average nightmare.
