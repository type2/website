Subject: MPG with new size wheels.

Hi volks,
	    Here's a small thing of note...

 Some of you may recall that I changed my wheels recently from stock
14x5.5 to 15x7, fitting brand new tyres (195/70R15C) in the process.
 I keep a note of my fuel usage and noticed a significant drop in
mpg with this change. Sure enough, when I measure the radius change
and do the numbers I get a calculated drop of 0.6 mpg which offsets
my measured change of 0.75mpg.

 This raises a couple of points of (minor) interest:

 (1) I am getting 0.15 mpg less as a result of my fatter tyres. I
suspect that this is attributable to higher actual speed, since I 
still look for the same indication on the speedo (and the bus is
much more comfortable at higher roadspeeds).

 (2) A similar change in rolling radius would account for a wide
variation in reported mpg. A listee running passenger tyres or
some other slightly undersized rubber would perceive significantly
higher mpg when comparing petrol pump to odometer readings.

 My actual change has been from 20.5mpg average over the past 15000
miles to 19.75mpg over the last three tankfuls (670 miles). Three
tankfuls is a small sample- we'll see what happens in time.

 NB All measurements are imperial: 20.5mp(i)g -&gt; 17 mp(us)g

Cheers,
	 W.

PS  Those of you who think this is a trivial detail should recall 
   that I'm in the UK, and hence paying the equivalent of $5/gal 
   for fuel.. :-(
