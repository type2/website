Subject: Broke down in Gerlach, NV - Tzara '74 1.8 dual carbs

Hello all,
No, we didn't break down, but our friend Tzara (the other orange bus we were
working on) did. He is in Gerlach, and he said the engine is making funny
noises, and he had started on his trip back home from the playa, and then
ended up driving back to gerlach.

I have no idea what it is, we are already home, and cant leave. I have a
feeling that due to the starvation of oil on the way down, he may have
toasted his bearings, however, we really don't know. He is thinking about
having it towed to Reno, I don't know of any good shops in Reno, and i
suggested, renting a uhaul to put his trailer (completely packed) in the
back of the truck, then towing the bus behind. Then at least if he needs an
engine rebuild that he can get it done here in Portland.

I just looked at the roadhaus shops, and saw this one, does anybody have any
suggestions, experience?
