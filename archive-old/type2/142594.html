Hi, All.
After an exhaustive search of the archives (both type2 and vanagon), google, and a look at Richard's expanded website, I am unable to find a reference that I know I've seen posted to the List on at least two occasions. This interactive website allowed you to choose a body color, two tone, bumper and wheel colors on a breadloaf, and I seem to recall it was not in english. 
Can any of you help me out here?

Thanks,
Andy McKinley
