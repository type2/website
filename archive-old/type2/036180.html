Subject: tenacious rear torsion and tension relief

need someone to tell me teh trick to the rear torsion bars.
do they pry off the splines a bit, drop down, and pry all the way
off? do they become easy to come off with up-tension?

i'm not getting very far with pulling them up, and i keep
stepping back and thinking, &quot;that's just putting more 
tension on them...&quot; what i need is less.
then i think, to hell with it. why even swap them out...
then i think, no... i have to get behind there.

my main concern is... how much tension is in there?
seems like quite a bit, i wouldn't want anything 
snapping loose and smacking me in the wrist or face
or something.

someone who has done this removal and replacement, please
impart guidance unto my personage.

thanks in advance - oh, my searching hte archives did not yield
the information i need.
no $$ to get a new book quite yet.
 
 going on instinct and insanity
