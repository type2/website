&gt;The question is what broke?  Clutch plate?  Throwout bearing?  At any rate,
the engine will have to come out to investigate.  I'd just as soon do it
myself but I think my dad wants to take it to the mechanic to have it fixed.
I don't think I can talk him into pulling the engine.  I'll have the
transmission oil seal and the crankshaft main oil seal replaced, as I
suspect the clutch will also be oil fouled.  

Sounds like the actuating arm broke.
