Subject: Re: [T2] Michelin MX availability?

Reinforced sidewall?
If yes, I get them from Discount Tire here in Fresno, Calif.
You won't find the MX reinforced shown anywhere. They have to call and ask.

&gt; Today someone slashed the left rear tire on my '79 Bus.  This Bus has
&gt; Michelin MX 185R14 tires which are basically in new condition, they don't
&gt; have a lot of miles on them.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to get a new MX to match but I'm not sure if they're still
&gt; available.  Tire Rack doesn't seem to have them, though they do have a
&gt; Michelin Agilis in that size.  I'm kind of iffy on mixing tread patterns.
&gt; Does anyone know if the MX is still available from Michelin?  If so, perhaps
&gt; I can have a local tire shop order it.
