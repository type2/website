Subject: EveryBus 2003 issue

I returned from being out of town this weekend and was greeted by a 
pile of e-mail regarding the &quot; Everybus 2003 Feedback&quot; post. I have 
not had a chance to respond to each message yet but I will.

A couple of important points
1) Response was overwhelmingly positive
2) Everybus will be well attended by folks from both coasts and all 
points in between as well as the &quot;Great White North, eh.&quot;
3)There will be a chilli cook off/pot luck.
4) I will do my best to get a carabus list on the web site
5) I have made a change to the riot act. I have removed the point 
concerning arriving in a VW bus, SC, DC, Vanagon, EV etc. This is a 
complex issue that falls into the &quot;letter of the law vs. the spirit 
of the law.&quot;  I should have fixed that from the onset.

The original intent was to keep the EB camping loop for buses and bus 
people. I realize from personal experience that some attempts to 
arrive at a camp out in a bus are foiled by little problems like 
blowing a motor en route :) Also, family members and friends 
sometimes arrive separately from the bus/driver. Some folks bring a 
support vehicle along with them legitimate reasons. I was aware of 
the previous issues when I put up the 2003 site and I was reminded of 
these facts by several folks recently.  I should have been more 
sensitives to these issues and I apologize for that.

To remedy the situation I have removed the specific point from the 
web site. When time permits I will clarify the issue on the web site 
for those who visit the web site as to why a change has been made.

Thanks
Chris
