&gt; Thom for the scan!  Perhaps it's destined for the 'Bus Hall of Shame'!

I'd be interested, if it isn't over 1 meg (my e-mail server limits files 
to that size... says it's inefficient to send large files via E-mail).

Last weekend, while visiting the Columbia Gorge, a bunch of monster 
trucks were being trailered down the other side of the hiway. I wish I'd 
had my camera handy. There was a VW van (loaf) atop one of those frames. 
Hmm... makes me wonder if it's for rent. I wonder how those hi-rise 4WDs 
would feel if THEY were tailgated for a change. &lt;grin&gt;

Jerks are cheaper by the dozen.

A fool and his money probably never go together in the first place.
