Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

thought of that one.  When I was at sears, it says they only have a 30
day (or 60, can't remember) warranty on those tools.  I read the label
on the other ones for sale...

&gt; &gt;I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated
&gt; &gt;before putting my engine back together.  It's a craftsman wrench and
&gt; &gt;it's at least 5 years old so it's probably a little bit out of
&gt; &gt;adjustment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
&gt; &gt;shops that'll do it?
&gt; ==========================&gt;
&gt; It's a Craftsman.
&gt; Tell 'em it does not meet spec any more, and you want a new one.
&gt; Lifetime warranty on Craftsman tools.
