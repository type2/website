Subject: FS Type IV Short Block

I've got a CV series Type IV (80-83 Vanagon, but will fit other years of
busses) Short block built and ready for sale. Price is $800.00 + shipping,
no core required.
http://www.engineceramics_dot_com/vw/vwparts.htm
I've sold about ten engines in five years and never had a defect or
complaint reported back to me.
This is a great engine with OEM pistons/cylinders, OEM camshaft, OEM
lifters.
The rebuilder did a first class and expensive rebuild on this engine.
