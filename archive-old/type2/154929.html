Subject: RE: [T2] Wanted: Westy Bed Brackets

&gt; Anybody have a cheap set? The Guac wants
&gt;  me to sleep in it this summer...


FWIW, I sell such a kit new, for $95 with listmember discount:

This comes from Just Kampers in England. It requires you to fashion your own
sofabed out of plywood and foam, pretty much like the stock Westy sofabed.
(The only such kit that worked with a stock rear Bus seat was the Z-Bed,
which as I recall was over $300 some years ago before Z Products folded - no
pun intended.)
