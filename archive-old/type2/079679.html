Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement - Dell Carbs

I run 36mm DRLA Dells on my Type IV powered Beetle. I like them (the car is 
has been temporarily retired) but may still look towards fuel injection. 
They required little attention.

They are out there. You have to find out what they fit originally and go 
from there in your hunt. Might include checking with the various car lists 
which favor these cars - like the Alfa Romeo groups. I got mine off of an 
Alfa Romeo in an Italian junkyard when I lived there. I can supply this 
info after the weekend.

Also read up on sizing. I went with the 36mm size because though I may lose 
a bit of top end power, I have a stronger vacuum signal at normal everyday 
engine speeds and thus it is easier to control the fuel and I get better 
gas mileage. I would plan to learn to jet and adjust (sync) your own carbs 
because it may be hard to find a local carb man to do that job and it costs 
$$$.

I was able to turn out mid 20's gas mileage in my Beetle on a stock 2.0 
with points style ignition on a 050 distributor (not the best choice 
probably), dual quiet packs, and the stock 2.0 camshaft. Basically I was 
running a stock junkyard engine with bolt on changes. I think you could do 
better with a homemade mixture gauge to help set the jetting and such. I 
tried the OEM jetting for the Alfa-Sud I took the carbs off, bought the CB 
Performance recommended jetting and then found a happy place using parts 
from both adjustments. I think it still needed some more tuning and a 
higher geared tranny for better mpg. I was runnign the stock 1969 gearbox 
for a 1500cc and I have since bought a 3.88 gearbox.

The DRLA carbs come in 36mm, 40mm and 46mm. A stock 2.0 with stock valves 
is sized just about right for a pair of 36mm carbs according to a Porsche 
Performance Handbook I own (their math).

There is another series of side draft carbs (the other carbs - DRLA - are 
downdraft) made by Dellorto that is functionally the same but have to be 
mounted on their sides. Popular with the VW GTI crowds and the like.

I have a picture of a Corvair engine running those carbs so it would be 
possible. They would also be well suited to an arrangement where they share 
an air cleaner assembly above the engine which could be properly heated 
with manifold heat to help prevent carb icing in the cold weather months 
using commonly found junkyard parts. Would also be easier to use for a 
turbo project because again they could share an air box. I've got a pair of 
46mm carbs for a &quot;future&quot; project just like this.

Some good pictures of very high quality parts (I own their cooling kit, 
intake manifolds, and carb linkage) are located at

www.ahnendorp_dot_com

Fat Performance also has nice Dellorto carb parts.

&gt;A few people have suggested Boston Bob or Jake Raby (and secretly I have
&gt;wished for one of their engines anyway).
&gt;
&gt;Well I called Boston Bob and he is very helpful. Being a master of these
&gt;engines he explained that my single weber carb is killing my engine. A new
&gt;engine from him with new heads and all would be about $2700. This is for a
&gt;2000cc engine with hydraulic lifters. Also he doesn't give a warranty for an
&gt;engine with the weber carb on it. He reccomends pulling the engine from a
&gt;78/79 with the FI, gas tank and tranny and retrofitting it on my new engine.
&gt;At the least I would need new dual carbs for a warranty. (I tried very hard
&gt;not to misquote, if I did I am sorry). We are talking about $3000 without an
&gt;install from a reputable mechanic (not me) to make my company happy and pay
&gt;for it. I just can't afford it.
&gt;
&gt;James Garrison and Richard Palmer both recommend Transporterwerks up in
&gt;Raliegh, about 2 hours away. I called and the owner is away so no pricing
&gt;but they can install me an AVP engine that they back and recommend or
&gt;rebuild my engine and they do rebuild these engines frequently. If I can
&gt;afford it I will have them rebuild my engine. If not then its the AVP.
&gt;
&gt;One thing I have had 2 people tell me is that I should look for some Delorto
&gt;dual carbs. Does anyone have these? I would have to go with the dual weber
&gt;carbs otherwise. There is also fuel injection. Can I put fuel injection on a
&gt;73? (boy I bet that is gonna bring a lot of emails)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to all who have helped. I have only pulled out half my hair today.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With 2,000 you should buy a motor from Boston Bob, have it shipped, pay
&gt; &gt; your mechanic to install it and follow Bob's advice on break in. I would
&gt; &gt; not trust a motor from anyone other than him or Jake. Go to Bob's website
&gt; &gt; and price it out yourself. I think his longblocks are around $1500. Jake
&gt; &gt; could probably make you a more powerful motor but I am a fan of stock
&gt; &gt; stuff.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (Well I hate to be the one to post this, because I am sure it comes up
&gt; &gt; pretty frequently. I looked at the archives, but there is so much it would
&gt; &gt; take a while to decipher it all)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am lucky enough that my Xmas bonus last year is $2000 towards replacing
&gt; &gt; my engine. Its a 1700cc with 166 000 original miles. Never rebuilt.
&gt; &gt; Apparently has bad rings and &quot;blow by&quot; because it pops every seal I
&gt; &gt; replace. There is nothing I would like more than doing it myself, but
&gt; &gt; because the company is paying for it they require I have somebody with
&gt; &gt; experience do the engine, so if something goes wrong I can take it back. I
&gt; &gt; will have my girlfriend smack me for being so lucky!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My question is should I:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)  buy an AVP engine (or another rebuilder) and have it installed by my
&gt; &gt; mechanic who works on foreign cars in general, but could probably install
&gt; &gt; it and get it running correctly. Approximate cost of AVP engine is $1200
&gt; &gt; for a long block. I have heard good and bad things about AVP. I know not
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; buy GEX.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) try to buy a spanking new engine (not sure the cost on that or the best
&gt; &gt; sources) and have my mechanic install it. Keep in mind I only have about
&gt; &gt; 2000 bucks (smack) but I plan to keep my bus &quot;forever&quot; and drive it on
&gt;long
&gt; &gt; trips.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) have my mechanic do the rebuild on my engine. He says he can do it, but
&gt; &gt; he doesn't rebuild pancake engines very much at all. He also said it could
&gt; &gt; be up to $2500 or $2800 with new pistons and everything. Said we would
&gt;have
&gt; &gt; to tear it down to know for sure, which sounds right. I would rather have
&gt; &gt; as much new stuff as possible, but have heard some say newer stuff is
&gt;worse
&gt; &gt; than the original stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What things should I make sure I get new? What other things should I ask?
&gt; &gt; As far as I know there is noone else here in Charlotte, NC that rebuilds
&gt; &gt; the pancake engine frequently like a Boston Bob or Jake Raby.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any input. I have started researching some, but a big check
&gt;just
&gt; &gt; came in so I better put my bus in the shop now while the money is
&gt; &gt; available.
