      The Pertronix is fine (I've used one with a FI engine for many
miles now with no problem) but the 009 isn't. It doesn't have the
requisite advance range for the T4 engine. And the FI would do better
with the vacuum advance. If you have to use the 009, you need to set the
initial advance at 10-12BTDC, 15 would be better.
