Subject: Re: [T2] Bus to Fiero engine?

I haven't heard of this engine in some years.  The &quot;Adiabatic&quot; engine was
basically an attempt to improve engine efficiency by raising the operating
temperature of the engine.  This is a good idea, but the limiting factor
is the materials used in the engine.  Ordinary materials are pretty much
maxed out as the engine designers are no fools and run as hot as they can
get away with.

Physics lesson, Run away!

The efficiency of any engine depends upon what is called the Carnot
(car-no) efficiency, which is the maximum theoretical efficiency.  The
Carnot efficiency depends upon the combustion temperature and the
ambient (outside air) temperature, both measured on the absolute
temperature scale.

The hotter the engine runs, or the colder the ambient temperature, the
more energy you can get out of the engine.  the limits of course, are the
point at which the metal melts, and the inconvenience of carrying large
blocks of dry ice to cool the ambient air!  :)

BTW, &quot;Adiabatic&quot; isn't all that good a term to describe this engine.
Adiabatic means a change in pressure and/or volume with no heat energy
lost from the system, which of course is pretty much the situation in
every engine.  Not much heat can escape in the time it takes to compress
the mixture in _any_ engine.  Still, &quot;adiabatic&quot; sounds kewl, and Smokey
has never been known to avoid a little flash now and then!
