Subject: Re: [T2] Re: T1 into T4

David is correct, my Bus was sold new in the Netherlands, 
(I recently moved to PA though :) ..  It's a single cab 
and it drove very nice with the stock 50Hp 1600. There 
are a lot of pro's and cons for both the type 1 and type 4 
engines. The best thing about the type 1 may be that parts 
are readily available from a wide variety of sources and 
at reasonable prices. The best thing about the type 4 (to me) 
is that its bottom end is virtually indestructible and it 
could be a nice base for a 200 Hp daily driven VW with full 
reliabillity. My Bus now has a 1776cc type 1. All parts but the 
case, carbs, and rear breast tin are new genuine VW, Porsche, 
or Berg. Doing this in the Netherlands set me back about $8.000 
or so. This gives me around 90 reliable Hp (never dynoed). It 
pulls to about 160km/h (give or take a few), where the rev 
limiter kicks in (914 rotor), it's like a goldfish, keep feeding 
it and it will eat itself to death :)  I wanted to stay away from 
type 4 engines because I know me and I'd spend twice as much. 

BUT, now I want to build a Bug that will be capable of doing 
200+Km/h all day, in a safe way, no overheating, and in an 
acceptable RPM range. And this is where I got interested in the 
type 4. It is very strong and can make use of a 911 cooling fan 
which about triples cooling capacity and would allow gearing 
changes. Oh well .. I'm rambling on ..  :) 

Again, email me for a picture of the engine compartment of my 
Bus, (or more) and if you're into high performance flat four 
engines, don't miss this (nicer than a Tatra even :) :

Also, I spent some time here today: http://www.csp-shop_dot_de 
click on &quot;Deutch&quot;, and then &quot;Flohmarkt&quot; in the list on 
the left. Lots of Bus stuff.
