I've got dual weber 34 ICT's on my 74 pickup with type IV engine and they 
work fine.  Greg

&gt;alright..my buddy has a type4engine thats in a 73transporter. through the 
&gt;lists advice, and of course common sense, we've realized that he needs new 
&gt;carbs. or the one's he has rebuilt.
&gt;so i was wondering, what u experienced vw owners would recommend doing 
&gt;here? should he rebuild his old 34dual-carbs? or should he put out the 
&gt;green energy and buy some new lungs?
&gt;now, if his best investment is goin with new ones, then what would be the 
&gt;cheapest but better route to go with here? and the catch is, he's lookin 
&gt;at only bein able to spend, probably at the most, 350$.
&gt;thanks for your time and attention, and for any help that u can pass our way.
