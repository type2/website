Subject: (((MORE HEATER QUESTIONS)))
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 1998 23:50:06 -0800

First off Happy Thanksgiving everyone, I know I have alot to be thankfull
for......anyways got several questions about improving heat.
1) what is the best material to wrap the heater tube, down the middle of
the bus, to insulate it ??
2) where is the best place to install a bilge blower, up towards the front,
or back by where it Ys off, by the     engine??
3) Having done these modifications, and with good heater boxes and good
door rubber etc. are you seeing    way better heat ?? or is there just a
little improvement ??
.I need to know which route to take....try and improve the stock setup or
purchase a gas heater...at this point doing either one seems to be a pain
in the ass, and I dont want to waste my time and effort going with the
wrong setup....thanks....Keith
