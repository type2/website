&gt; Nobody ever mentioned:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 pt. of Everclear.  works as carb cleaner, electrical contact cleaner,
&gt; emergency fuel, antiseptic, and if you just can't fix it it will give you
&gt; a positive outlook about your troubles (and a nasty headache afterward!)

Caveat Emptor!  Everclear is now putting out a 151 proof (as opposed to 
186 proof) version.  This &quot;Weak *ss *hit&quot; is unacceptable in my mind
and may also not be as useful as a carb cleaner as it once was.  I have
only seen this in California -- the only place i've bought everclear
of late -- and would be interested to hear if it's still &quot;full strength&quot;
elsewhere or not.

Good call though!
