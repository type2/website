To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello All,

Has anyone ever found anyone better than Carlsen's
Audi in California for dealer parts?  It would be nice
to have a dealer like this on the East Coast.  Claire
Audi claims they have to charge more for VW parts, and
MAAS only seems to be able to get one of the hoses I
need.  My specific question centers around water hoses
for an 82 Diesel Westfalia.  The most complicated hose
(with two formed offshoot branches) lists for $95. 
Amazingly it still feels OK. although how long can
these hoses last?
Thanks.

Rob
