Subject: Re: [T2] Notes on painting a poptop

Hi there,

If you have enough paint left over you should consider painting the 
bumpers to match. I did mine two full seasons ago using $30/liter 
($cdn) Interlux Premium Yacht Enamel and it still looks really sharp.

Happy trails,

&gt; The paint is very white and very glossy.  It doesn't match the original
&gt; finish, but I think it looks great.  It's certainly easier to clean.
