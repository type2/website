Chuck,

For the very short time my '78 had an AC system, I took the compressor
off the bracket and laid it in the driver's tray area.  A bear to do, but
possible.

If it is empty, there is no harm in disconnecting the lines from the
compressor, but if you plan on keeping/rehabbing the system, I would not
leave it open for any length of time.  Condensation is an enemy in AC and
if it is open, then condensation can happen.

I don't know if you can get an AC service company to come and drain it
on-site for free, but with the price they are charging for used freon,
they *should* be willing to!
