&gt; This weekend I replaced the rear brake cylinders on my 78 bus.

&gt; 
&gt; According to Bentley, you need to removed the brake
&gt; drum (including castelated shaft nut) and brake shoes to do this. After
&gt; wrestling with the castelated shaft nut
&gt; for a couple of hours, and despairing that I am not nearly strong enough for
&gt; this work, I gave up and replaced the rear brake cylinders without removing
&gt; the shaft nut or brake shoes.
&gt; 
&gt; It worked just fine. (Yes, I did remove the pin that holds it before
&gt; attempting to remove the nut).
&gt; 
&gt; This is not the first such experience I have had with Bentley. Bentley says
&gt; that you need to remove the engine in order to
&gt; replace the shift rod coupling. Experience shows that this is not true.
&gt; 
&gt; -- end Rant --
&gt; 
&gt; These shortcuts may not be news to bus guru's.
&gt; 
&gt; In the future, I will be aware that Bentley's procedure may not be the
&gt; simplest.

Ron:
Some of us already knew that. Bentley has many errors! The Bentley
procedure for assembling a late Vanagon transmission is physically
impossible! The pictures are nice, however! This list is way better, but
one does have to decide who he or she best communicates with. Some of
the things we argue about are sooo hard to measure objectively that to
the casual observer or a new visitor one could get the opinion that we
like to argue more than anything else. But there are some really
experienced, and generous people on this list. Advice is free for the
asking.
Glad to hear you had such a good weekend, wish I could say the same
(waterboxers GRRR!)
