I have a set of 4 brand new ball joints for sale.  I purchased them with all intentions of doing it myself, but that (I believe) is impossible.  I paid $120 for all four of them, but will take less than that to get rid of them.  I am purchasing a complete set of torsion arms with new German ball joints already installed  in there.  It is more money, but much less of a headache!!  Email me directly with an offer.  I'll pay shipping.  See you at the Oktoberbus!

Peace,
