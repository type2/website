&gt;&gt; I just picked up my new clutch/pressure plate and release bearing. I have
&gt;&gt; them all installed already but have one question about the pressure plate. I
&gt;&gt; don't have a torque wrench and was wondering if I can manage tightening this
&gt;&gt; plate without one. I think the spec is 18ft lbs and I have all the bolts as
&gt;&gt; tight as I can get them.
&gt; 
&gt; Wow!  I hope you're a wimp!  18 ft-lbs isn't all that much, but since you
&gt; are working on steel threads you probably didn't hurt anything.

What I'm most worried about is whether he got them even all the way around,
which is next to (if not completely) impossible without a torque wrench--
and when you're doing a clutch, &quot;even&quot; is more important in terms of warp-
prevention than is &quot;torqued to VW specs.&quot; You probably wouldn't hurt the
clutch even if it was 50 lb-ft all the way around, but 51/52/61/55/53/49 is
definitely going to screw up the works.
