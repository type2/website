Subject: Autographed CD

[...]

&gt;To All...
&gt;...but especially to the person who asked if I would sign his copy of the
&gt;'Sermon' CD... and to whom I responded with some light-hearted remark.
&gt;
&gt;Please accept my apology.  There's no excuse for boorishness but other than
&gt;bank tellers and traffic cops, no one has ever asked me for my autograph  -- I
&gt;thought you were joking.  Then two more people asked the same thing, including
&gt;a lady planning to surprise someone at Christmas -- whose surprise could not
&gt;possibly be greater than mine at receiving such a request.
&gt;
&gt;You've honored me by purchasing the CD.  It would be my pleasure to return the
&gt;favor by signing it.
&gt;
&gt;I suggest you send me just the cover.  If you bought the CD for someone else,
&gt;please include a note telling how you'd like it signed.  A stamped, self-
&gt;addressed envelope would be the quickest way to get it back to you.
&gt;
