&gt;  in hopes that it gets here by the weekend.  In order to wire a
&gt;  replacement pump that has round stud and nut terminals, instead of the
&gt;  original spade terminals, I'm going to have to create some very short wires
&gt;  with round &quot;washer&quot; style terminals on one end and spades on the other end.

run by an electronics parts store even Radio Shack where you can pick up
spade terminals that have a hole for going onto the round style terminals
to convert them.  probably set you back 10-15 cents each...

glad you found what is hopefully the last glitch
