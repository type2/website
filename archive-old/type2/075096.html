To get the ends of that link out from either the EGR valve or the
throttle valve, just use a screwdriver and pop either side of the link
off.  Comes off real easy if you pry at the correct angle.

hope this ascii art doesn't get mangled:


------------egr-link---------\
screwdriver blade here  -&gt;   |
and just twist to pop      --o-------  &lt;- throttle arm
link out                     |

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I can get the linkage between my throttle and egr
&gt; &gt; valve? I have looked at a bunch of parts web sites and emailed
&gt; &gt; bustedvw_dot_com - but no one seems to have it.
&gt; 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Bill and I discussed this a bit earlier in the weekend.  The part he needs
&gt; is (not) visible in this picture:

&gt; 
&gt; The missing linkage *should* be the same for all air cooled FI buses.
&gt; When I have serviced the EGR valve unit, I have always had to remove the
&gt; valve and the nut on top of the butterbly shaft of the throttle body.  It
&gt; has been a while and i forget exactly why, but I think the ends do not
&gt; come out of either end peacefully.
&gt; 
&gt; Please give Bill a hand if you have one of these pups in your parts stash!
