Subject: Re: Oil Temp Gauge: The Wiring and Such

On Tue, 1 Sep 1998, T. Howze gave advice to Travis Neal about Oil Temp 
gauge wiring:

&gt; . . .The other thing (more tedious but more professional) would be to run a
&gt; wire with a female push on right to the &quot;hot&quot; part of the fuse block.
&gt; Both ways give your gauge a constant power supply, regardless of whether
&gt; your bus is on or off.
&gt; 
! ! ! You don't want a constant 12v to your gauge ! ! !

It doesn't do anything, and just means the gauge will break sooner.  It 
should be connected to a &quot;switched&quot; 12v that only has current through it 
when the key is turned.


&gt; I would use 12 gauge wire for any power wires.  Granted, this gauge
&gt; probably doesn't need much juice, but a lower gauge is never a problem,
&gt; and a higher gauge can be.  As a matter of fact, I used 12 gauge for the
&gt; whole install, which doesn't matter, but some might say is overkill:). 
&gt; 

It is overkill.  You need 18 gauge wire, even 20 would work fine.  There 
is absolutely no advantage/need to use 12 gauge for this application.


&gt; As for the light on the gauge, I spliced right into the power for my
&gt; speedometer light, using the same splicing piece.  That way the gauge is
&gt; dimmed/brightened along with the other lights on the dash.  The ground is
&gt; again, very simple.
&gt; 
Good plan

And you thought putting in a gauge was easy?
