Subject: Jake Raby motor reviews ?

Hi,

I would be interested to hear from anyone that has purchased a type 1 
motor from Jake Raby at 
http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/Home_Page.htm .  I am in shopping 
for an engine builder and am intrigued by Jake's take on building 
motors. Jake took the time out the answer a lot of sophomoric 
questions from me which I appreciate!!!!!! Since I do not currently 
know anyone that has purchased a motor from  him I was hoping there 
would be a few listmembers out there that have who could share there 
experiences with me.

Thanks
Chris
