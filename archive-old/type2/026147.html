At the weekend I drained the tank so I could replace the last original piece
of fuel hose.  Amazingly, I didn't spill any on myself.  Now I know how
accurate my fuel gauge is.  Pretty good - with the needle on the white line
at the bottom of the red section, there was exactly a gallon left.  At least
I don't have to get paranoid whenever the gauge screams &quot;FILL UP&quot; at me.

The old hose was intact but the braiding was crumbling away and I could pull
the hose in two with my bare hands.  Not so with the nice new super strong
hose I got from the VW dealer.

Talking of which, the main dealers get a lot of bad press because people say
they don't want to deal with the likes of us with old cars.  My local
dealer, Priory Park VW/Audi, is great.  They are very knowledgable, give
good service and don't treat you like something they picked up on their
shoe.  They even mixed up some paint for me and had to get the formula from
the manufacturer because it was an old paint code.  I got about 1/2 a litre
for 5 pounds.  What a bargain!  Try that with any other car make, they just
wouldn't want to know.

While I had the tank drained, I rebuilt the fuel pump.  I had a feeling that
fuel might have been leaking into the crankcase (judging by some of the
posts in the archives) but I see now that shouldn't be possible because of
the drain hose which goes through the piece of tin under #1 &amp; 2 cylinders.
As long as this hose isn't blocked, any fuel leaking past the diaphragm will
drain out before it has a chance to go into the case.  I conclude that
either I'm running too rich or the float valves are leaky.  The latter is
hopefully unlikely as my carbs are new, but my mileage has been good on long
runs so the mixture shouldn't be too bad.
