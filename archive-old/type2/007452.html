&gt; &gt; I would replace the line traveling from the Servo
&gt; &gt; to the Engine, the one with the one way air check 
&gt; &gt; in it. I replaced it last month and it took care 
&gt; &gt; of some vacuum leaks that I was having. You need 
&gt; &gt; the right kind - I bought mine from the dealer for $80 for only a couple of meters, but it's got the scotch guard in it. This replacement stopped my 
&gt; &gt; wild idle and hot running
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Chris..
&gt; 
&gt; How did you diagnose that the servo was bad?  I've got a 71 bus that won't
&gt; hold an idle (dies) and runs really hot.  Any idea if the servo mechanism
&gt; is the same, i.e. the troubleshooting runs across years?
&gt; 
&gt; Should I be clamping the vacuum line in various places as it runs to the
&gt; front of the bus to look for leaks?
&gt; 
&gt; What are the trouble signs of a bad brake/vacuum servo?

(Since this was posted to the list, I'll offer my two cents as well...)  
The easiest way to troubleshoot is to disconnect the servo hose at 
the engine and cap the vacuum port.  If the engine runs 
better/different then you've got a leak somewhere, most likely at 
the servo, though it could be the hose or (unlikely) the metal tube.  
Another symptom of a bad servo is dying/rough running when  
pushing down on the pedal while stopped at idle.  As for the one 
way valve, if you can blow through it one way and not the other, it's 
okay.  (It should be installed so the air flows toward the engine, of 
course.)

Hope this helps!
