&gt;Ace Hardware has them too, but not in the length I seem to need. The back
&gt;bolt seems to need to be about 120mm long. The longest I can find is 40mm.
&gt;Of course, if I retap the hole to 1.25 or 1.5 pitch, I can get any size I
&gt;want...

If you simply retap a 10mm hole with a new pitch, you are not going to have any good threads.  Please go to True Value and find the proper bolts.  If you can't find them there, get them from a fastener shop like Ababa bolt in El Cajon, CA.  I found that of the available sizes at True Value, one fit the front holes fine but the next longer bolt was too long for the back holes, so I used some narrow washers under the head of the bolt to make up the difference.  You can thread a bolt that is too long right down into the exhaust port until it hits the back of the exhaust valve - be careful not to do this.  Best is to remove your heat exchangers and look up into the port to make sure the bolt isn't protruding.

A quick fix is not what's needed here - you need the proper hardware if you want this to be the last time you have to mess with it.
