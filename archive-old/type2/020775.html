Subject: No Good deeds Go Unpunished!!

Had to tell you this story--That just happened a few moments ago--I have just two Dr. Joe
Bus Tow bars left--
So someone called and asked if they would fit a 72 bus--I said i had heard there was a
problem--But come to my home and we can check it out--Bad back and all, i climb under the
72 to see if the tow bar would fit--Seems the steering dampner and the master cylinder
power brake unit  are in the way--But if you take off the steering dampner   it looks like
it will fit?  The guy says Yes, he will take it, and make it work--But still needs a 1
7/8&quot; ball for the hitch--I go into the house for the ball and come out and see him picking
up a my brand new early chrome VW emblem for the front of my 63 23 and sticking it into
his 72!! I go to his bus and pull out my emblem--he says &quot;Sorry man --, but i really
needed it&quot;!!!
I give him back the money for the tow bar--as i think Dr. Joe would not want me to sell to
a thief!!
Even though Dr. Joe is gone--i could not take money from a thief and give it to his
Family--as i said he left without the tow bar--, uj
