Subject: RE: Genuine VW parts from dealers?

You are vastly underestimating the scale of such a product. There are
thousands and thousands of parts still available from dealers (but not
neccessarily at affordable prices).  The project you describe would take
forever to complete because of the sheer number of parts, and since
availability changes, the results would be outdated shortly after they were
compiled.  Also, all the dealer could tell you is whether his parts book
lists the part as obsolete (which may or may not be correct, since the books
are often not completely up-to-date themselves), or whether VW has it in
stock at the moment (which may may not mean anything, since they are often
backordered on non-obsoleted parts or have remaining stock on obsolete
ones).  So neither would definitively answer your question anyway.

&gt;
&gt; It would be a useful list project to determine what parts are still
&gt; available for which buses through dealers, and at what prices. If we
&gt; could somehow make up a list for all the years between '68 and '79, then
&gt; everyone on the list could select maybe ten items (by part number) and
&gt; visit the dealer to find out price, whether it is in stock or has to be
&gt; ordered, etc. Then report back to someone who could organize a web page.
&gt;
&gt; But I'm a bad administrator and shouldn't try to take the thing on myself.
