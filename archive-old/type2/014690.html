Regarding the bucket with water mouse trap. 
What happens in winter when the water freezes? Won't happen if you 
use RV plumbing system antifreeze. It doesn't' freeze, and it
preserves the mice so they don't rot and stink in the spring;-)
Good for putting in van during winter storage if you think you might get
mice in it.
