Subject: Under dash a/c in baywindow

Junkyarding the other day, I cam across an under dash a/c in an old mid 70's
bay.

The underdash unit was perfect.

Here is my situation.  In the 73 I am restoring, it has an overhead unit
that is white and kinda crappy looking.  Also I do not care for the hoses
coming into the car to that unit.


I want to use the better of the 2 units........I am swapping to a rotary
type compressor and am putting new r-134 lines on the car
anyway..........would the underdash work better?
