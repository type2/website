&gt;&gt;What year is that?  My '71 doesn't look like that at all, no little box.

&gt;
&gt;That picture is from my 1973 bus, but I'm not 100% sure the gauge cluster
is original.  Could be a '74 cluster as I parted out a '74 bus once and may
have swapped the cluster at some point over the years.  I suspected that
not all year busses had that box from my junkyard explorations, but I know
that many did have them because I bought a couple extras.  Back when my
gauge used to go to zero when I got down to half a tank, I swapped out
every part but the sender hoping to fix it.  All for naught, the sender
ended up being bad.  I think that box may have started with the
introduction of the type4 engine (1972) but that's only a guess.
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like a job for... &lt;drum roll&gt;... KARL!  :)
**********************************
Actually I can help here.

Both the gauge and sender on the 1973 Bus changed in January 1973.  Here
are the part numbers and vin:

Up to 2x3 2138 900:
Gauge:  211 957 063
Sender:  211 919 051 (Tube Style)

2x3 2138 901 thru 1979 production year:
Gauge:  211 957 063A
Sender:  211 919 051A (Lever Style)

The gauges and senders are matched to each other.  The early gauge coupled
with a late sender will work, but will be inaccurate.  Same applies on a
late gauge and early sender.

Hope this helps
