&gt; After cleaning, air drying, and reassembling your c.v.s', put them in the
&gt; oven for a while.

I just set them in the sun for awhile.  OOPs, I forget that I live in 
sunny CA.  I have short metal shed, I can place parts there to 
dry/bake.

&gt; 1. What is an appropriate solvent for cleaning the grease
&gt; out of my wheel bearings so that I may check them. 

In my work world (Aerospace) cleanliness is excrutiatingly important. 
One of the few solvents that does NOT leave a residue behind is 
Acetone.
