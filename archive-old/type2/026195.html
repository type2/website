	Subject: [T2] tail light sockets

	ok, i've got my tail lights ['71 westy] more or less working again, 
	but the problem with them seems to be flaky bulb sockets on both 
	sides. the bulbs lock into the bayonet socket, but they're not very 
	firmly held in place. if you push in on the bulb a little too much, 
	the spring loaded contacts don't push the bulb into the bayonet. i 
	don't really see how these can be repaired, since it's a small 
	internal part. i'm thinking at this point that maybe i just need to 
	buy new tail light assemblies, which should have firmer sockets.

	before i order this, does anyone know of a trick to retension the 
	springs? i couldn't see how this thing would come apart to do it 
	myself.

Being the owner of multiple types of VWs I can't seem to picture the exact
setup of the Bus right now.  But if you can get to the back of the unit from
the inside of the engine bay you can just push down the spring clip (while
the bulb is out) to give it more tension.  You should also scrape off some
of the buildup of crud from where the little buttons on the bulb make
contact.  If you can't get to it from inside, use the 90 degree angle side
of a scribe to catch the spring clip and pull on it and use the same tool to
scrape off the contact points of the socket.

	Any light experts out there?  I can't get the right side back lights
to
	work.  When I put on the right turn signal, the right back middle
(running
	light) blinks (all other lights perform correctly).  When I press
the brake
	pedal, the right side back light all but goes out (Gets extremely
dim) and
	the left side gets very bright.  With the running lights on, both
sides
	work but the right side is a little dimmer than the left.  I had to
repair
	the flasher switch - it had fallen apart.  Before the turn signals
and
	emergency flashers were out all together.  I don't see any obvious
	problems.  I took the gauge panel out to see better.  

You may have the hot wires crossed (running light attached to the brake
side) on the right hand unit.  Also, by &quot;flasher switch&quot;, are you talking
about the turn signal lever?  If so you may have a grounding short against
the column.
