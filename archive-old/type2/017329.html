&gt; &gt;I for one don't buy into any
&gt; &gt;of that philosophy. In my opinion the 009 is more
&gt; &gt;stock than the vacuum advance distributor, and its the only concession I
&gt; make
&gt; &gt;to customization.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you going to also say that front drum brakes are superior to disks?
&gt; And that vacuum assist is frivolous?  I'm curious.

Well put!
I continue to believe that (stoner) John Muir causes more harm than
good! I remember reading in an early edition how he didn't trust CV
joints- would we all go back to swing axles? (I do believe swing axles
might be still more durable and quite appropriate to 3rd. world roads
like rural Mexico.)
If anyone wants to see what a centrifugal distributor will act like in
their van, pull those hoses off the vac advance and put nails in the
hoses to plug the vacuum leaks. (you already have a centrifugal
distributor if your engine was built after about 68 or so).
I think the great charm of 009's is that it's sooo simple. With all
those hoses on the old one, many people just aren't sure if everything
is working. The only way to really tell is to LEARN what it's supposed
to do and get a dynamic timing lite and then diagnose it.
WAY easier to just spend the money for an 009 and then have some peace
of mind. Too bad it doesn't help!
