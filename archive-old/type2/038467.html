(74 transporter, ongoing rebuild began summer 99)

List,

After new points, condenser and plug wires - she belched forth smoke
from the assembly oil in her cylinders and came to life!

I held the rpms  until the thermostat opened, then a little longer and
killed it, then i did it again.  I have a little oil leak from the oil
pump and a small one from the cooler - but she runs like a top.

We got the passenger side front arms, knuckle, caliper assembled last
night. Starting to look like a bus again.

Gonna try to get the driver's side done saturday or sunday, bleed the
brakes and she hits the ground.  Been on jack stands for almost a year.

Got a few cooling tin leaks to attend to and an exhaust leak to fix before
it sees any serious road time, but these are the last days.

Feels good, i tell ya. I was giddy last night and was chipper and aware
this morning.  Finishing (well- almost) a project helps the head, i tell
ya.

Thanks again to the list - wouldn't have done it with out you!

BTW - the t_at_yota (83 4wd tercel wagon)
bit the dust tuesday - went down fightin' - gotta be
head related.
Will be replacing it with an 88 Toy truck - 22r - woohoo!

Close to easter - my bus is kinda like that other fella that came back to
life, maybe?

Thanks volks,
