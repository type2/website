Subject: spare tire mount

My mechanic-buddy installed mine on the nose via four long carriage bolts
that go through the mounting bracket, through the nose and through the very
heavy-guag metal air distribution vents in the cab where they meet their
lock washers and nuts.  I can jump up and down on the spare tire and it goes
nowhere.  It's a very elegant solution despite how brutal it sounds.

cheers,
