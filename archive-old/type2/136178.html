&gt; I did US50 through Nevada and into Utah last year.  I would highly

I'm very familiar with the CA/NV/UT portion of the road.  However, I am
intrigued with the idea of doing the whole thing.  Perhaps it's the fact
that it is probably the longest and most intact US route left.  US 66
gets all the press, but there's a lot more left of US50 to drive.

George &lt;--whose first memories were of living 30 miles north of US50, 40
miles east of Fallon, NV.  If you think it is lonely now...
