Bill,

You can find grommets that will work in your local hardware store. But WCM
also reproduces them. We sell these new and all other wiper hardware (mostly
used). Look under Electrical Equipment then Windshield Wipers. I need to
update the price on the grommets to $2.25 for the pair. www.bustedvw_dot_com.
Give me a call if you just need the grommets and I'll mail them to you for
$2.25 and $3.50 priority mail (2 day).

Subject: [T2] wiper shaft seals


I just repaired some very minor rust around my windshield. I now need to
find new seals to go around the shafts from that hold the wiper arms. I
tried to find something that would work at  the local hardware store
with no luck. Anyone
have a suggestion or source?

Thanks,
