I second this option.  MUCH less destructive!  Also, my closet has become
a very valuable storage place while taking trips...  Lotsa blankets can be
piled in there.

Funny how we cringe at the thought of yahoos lowering their busses or
chopping new holes in the roof, but we seem to advocate the wholesale
slaughter of irreplaceable Westfalia cabinetry.

If you don't like your cabinets, sell them to someone else.  Make some new
ones that suit your tastes.  In the meantime, buy a convex mirror at
Wallyworld for $.99. 

&gt;Or you could buy a convex mirror and stick it on to the passenger side
&gt;mirror.  No saw zal needed
&gt;Rob

&gt;&gt; cabinet.  Took a sawz-all and removed the top portion of the cabinet,
