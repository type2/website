Looking for two steel wheels for 71 bus. One is for the 71 resto that just
came back from the paint shop. * They removed the spare, and lost it*.  The
other is for my daily driver* The Free Bus*. to replace the spare, * that
looks like it must  have come loose at one time and chewed up the inner
circle that goes over the axel stub*.

I could probably buy them from my local salvage yard  but would prefer not
to have to deal with them.

Please p-mail: orgvw_at_yahoo_dot_com
