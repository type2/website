Adam,

I'll leave the weather forecast to someone else.
The roads in Baja are generally excellent, although they can twist a bit, 
so pay attention when driving--sometimes those &quot;Curva Peligrosa&quot; signs 
are missing.  The main road down to Cabo is generally empty, well-paved, 
well-marked, and has good services down the entire length.  The Baja run 
is totally no sweat, and very pretty to boot.  The condition of side 
roads can vary widely, but are often quite good--and can lead you to 
really cool spots away from the hoards.  
 
 Some may complain that Baja is over-run with gringos--and that is 
certainly true of the bigger tourist spots--but don't let those people turn 
you off.  The mystique of Baja is there for you to discover if you get 
off the Baja &quot;interstate.&quot;  Baja's very, very nice, and it's all within 
an easy three-day run from Sandy Eggo.  

Stories of the rigours of Baja are overblown.  A run down the Rocky 
Mountains, or on dirt roads in the Mojave are far more demanding than a 
cruise down to Cabo.  If you want to explore extensively off-road, it's 
not quite so casual.  But use your head and you'll be fine even then.

'Course driving in Mexico is a little different than in the USA: watch 
for animals; don't drive at night; watch for pot holes; the roads are 
somewhat narrower than in the US; and bring your basic spares, especially 
if you're driving a newer bus.  You may want to bring a jerry for extra 
fuel range, although we never had a problem with fuel availablility.  
Mexico is much safer for travellers than the US, so you don't have to 
worry about getting shot by some nut with a big gun and a self-esteem 
problem.  Treat the locals nice, don't display wealth, and everybody's 
happy.

Go and explore Baja.  It's a wonderful place.

Tobin

P.S.  AAA has a good map of Baja California, and it's free to members.  
For some odd reason, maps can be hard to find in Mexico.
