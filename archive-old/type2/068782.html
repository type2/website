&gt;I've heard that under Smog II you are required to smog the car with the 
&gt;engine that came in your car. In other words, I wouldn't be able to 
&gt;switch back to a '76 engine and I would be required to meet the smog laws 
&gt;set for a '79 vehicle rather than a '76 vehicle.
&gt;...

When I put a '78 engine into my '73 chassis, the State forced me to go to
a State inspection station for my smog certificate.  I had performed an
&quot;engine swap&quot; and the inspector would check to insure that all the emissions
equipment that goes with the '78 is present and functional.  I passed all
inspections and received a 3x5&quot; white sticker that says smog to '78 standards.

You can legally swap in an engine from any year _after_ the chassis year.

In your case, you'll have to get a State inspection for the '79 &quot;engine swap&quot;.
In the future you may swap back from a '79 engine to the original '76; that
would constitute another &quot;engine swap&quot;.  Inspection time again.

&gt;...
&gt;What I'd prefer to do is tell the DMV that I purchased the vehicle 
&gt;without an engine, and then at my leisure after fixing up the body, just 
&gt;put the correct year engine into my bus.
&gt;...

Sounds like the way to go.  You'll be keeping your transporter in a more
original condition and you won't have to go to the State for your initial
smog inspection. Take it to the cheap-o smog place at the filling station
on the corner.   

I have not had any experience with SmogII... yet.
