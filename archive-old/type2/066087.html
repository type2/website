&gt; You are among several who have posted that it's illegal to retrofit old 
&gt; vehicles w/ smog devices. I assume this is just in CA? Do you know if it 
&gt; also applies if a later model engine was retrofitted, one that 
&gt; originally came w/ these devices installed? I seem to recall, a number 
&gt; of years ago, articles mentioning fitting 'converters into street 
&gt; rods... but that may be a thing of the past.

I am located in SO Cal. I am looking into doing the Suburu conversion on 
my TYPE 2 69. I talked with a smog rEp and they told me they expected me 
to have every last smog part the Suburu came with, including the 
CATALYTIC CONVERTER (!!!!!?????)  I do not know what is up, but I thought 
you guysd mightr like to know that is what they told me as of yesterday, 
tues.
