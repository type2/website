Subject: Re:  valve cover leaksge

David:

I'd guess that your gasket is squooging out from between the mating
surfaces of your valve cover and head.  This has happened to me.

Try a fresh set of valve cover gaskets.  Clean both surfaces yadda yadda
yadda.  Some folks use a gasket compound to glue the gasket into place on
the valve cover before installing the cover on the head.  This will keep
the gasket from slipping off the mating surface when the cover is
installed.
