When you release the handbrake and take off it goes clunk? Does it feel like
it is bound up a little on the right side and then breaks loose? Do you live
in a damp climate? Sounds like the parking brake is seizing to the drum over
night. Solution? Never put the parking brake on when they are damp. I live
in Arizona and don't drive my bus everyday. In the winter, if I set the
brake and leave it for a couple of days, it will do this.
