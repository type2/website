I like my 009 that I inherited in my '69 camper.  Loads more power 
than my '73
beetle, even tho the bug had a rebuilt motor.  All stock otherwise.  One question, tho- Where to time it?!? I'me getting mixed signals 
here folks!  20, 35, 7.5, depends on mex or german manufacture, etc.
Muir sez 7.5 for all 009.  Others say 20 for mexican 009, 35 for ge
rman parts. I am thoroughly confoozed.

Thx,

Blake
