Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Electric Bus (original VW electrobus)

This reply might be a bit late to last weeks 'Elcetro
bus' topic. But I didn't see the link to the Electro
bus of the German baywindowclub 'IGT2'. here it is:

http://www.vw-bus-museum_dot_de/html/e-bully.html

It is a late model double sliding door panelvan. It is
the one that is pictured in the VW Electrobus brochure
(it must be somewhere on the net as well).

It still uses gasoline for the Eberspdcher BA6
petrol-heater.

Notice the sliding doors with vents....they must be
hard to find ;-)

And about the '1971' electrobus from last week:

It surely is a 1973 model. The model of door for the
fuel filler cap was only used in the 1972 and 1973
modelyears. So looking at the front with the high
positioned turnsignals and the square bumpers I must
conclude that this is very likely to be a 1973 bus.

Also the old model sliding door was used until
modelyear 1973.

yours,

Vincent
