Check your distributor seal and also take a look at the oil breather.

Does anyone know where I can find some new oil breather parts?  Mines

&gt; I've been noticing a lot of oil collecting on the left side of my duel port
&gt; just under the oil pressure switch. I replaced it but oil is still
&gt; collecting, it's also seems to be spraying on to the back engine cover metal
&gt; and inside the hood door. Any ideas. Could this be coming from bad oil cooler
&gt; gaskets?
&gt; TIA,
