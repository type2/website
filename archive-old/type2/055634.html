Subject: Loaf camper layouts

In an effort to balance the splitticentrism that sometimes
occurs on the list, it would be interesting to read pros and cons
of the in-line driver's side Westy kit of later loaves versus the
earlier, split-like kits.

Although I have no direct experience with them (maybe
_because_ I have no experience) it seems to me that the later
kits were a more efficient layout, but were lacking somewhat
in charm and coziness?
