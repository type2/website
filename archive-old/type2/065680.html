&gt; I've never seen one &quot;in the flesh&quot; put it's pictured in the loaf/bay parts
&gt; manual, on the military equipment page (I think).

&gt; It's just a shaped peice of board with a window in!
&gt; 

Dad's '65 non walk through had what I believe to have been
a factory partition.  Was as I recall a particle board (masonite?)
thing covered with the grey stuff on both sides typically
uses in panel interiors.  Had a maybe 1 foot x 2 foot
plexiglass window.  Course I was like 5 when this bus left
us, so what do I recall.  I do not recall how it installed.
Over the years there have been buses in the VW mags
illustrating partitions.

Personally I believe the ideal material is 1/2&quot; insulated
R-board.  Often faced in foil or a blue color, around here
I have also seen it faced in a hard resin impregnated grey
fiber material around the foam core.  I think cutting a
bit to shape then adding a plexiglass window glued onto the
board, or framed up a bit for beauty if you want would be
the ideal ticked.  Of course bays being primarily walk throughs
will require a bit going down as well.  Cut closely enough to
contour I figure that scrunching the foam into position would
be enough to hold it.  Total outlay should be under $20 and
increase in heater capability would be enourmous.
