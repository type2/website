Subject: Re: [T2] To Sipe or not to Sipe? (Terry)

Funny you should mention Nokians - I was going to (if
I can afford) buy a set of them, but I have exhausted
all my resources without finding a load range C Nokian
14&quot;. There are &quot;Reinforced Sidewall&quot; passenger car
tires, but no &quot;C&quot; range - according to Discount and
TireFactory and hours of web searching! Discount
quoted $130 per tire for the reinforced sidewall
version. Back to the Coopers for me!

Thanks for the info on the Yoko's. I guess D's are a
bit harsh. I'm happy with the BF Goodrich &quot;C's&quot; and
the Cooper &quot;C's&quot; so I guess I'll stick with what I'm
happy with. The siping I did on the worn out Coopers
seems to have helped tremendously. -BaH

&gt; 
&gt; There were like driving on ball bearings when it was
&gt; wet &amp; with snow on
&gt; the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; They did squish out the water OK--and worked better
&gt; in snowy conditions,
&gt; but still wern't really that good.
&gt; 
&gt; They wore out in 25,000 miles, and I think from what
&gt; I have heard --it's
&gt; the nature of that tire to wear out pretty fast .
&gt; 
&gt; Siping is a good thing--look at the face of a Nokian
&gt; Hakkapalita--their
&gt; siped from the factory and are great tires in the
&gt; winter.
