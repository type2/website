Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

 &gt; I am conveying the accepted practices of  rust removal and restoration
 &gt; processes, in any run of the mill vehicle body shop repair
 &gt; facility.--nothing out of the ordinary.
 &gt; It's all pretty much run of the mill procedures.
 &gt;
 &gt; POR products don't even come into conversation at any of these place's--
 &gt;
 &gt; Maaco, or Earl Sheib, doesn't use the stuff.

Terry, And your point is that professional shops don't use it? Last time I
checked nobody ever thought the likes of Maaco, Earl Shieb etc, are
&quot;professional&quot; shops... In fact I'd be more concerned about using POR 15 if
these outfits actually DO use it... LOL

And no I'm not taking a position on POR, never used it, don't even own a
bus. But after reading your posts re POR over the past 2 years I'm really
surprised you would mention these companies in your ongoing crusade to
convince people that using POR to stop / slow rust is just wrong, wrong,
wrong...
