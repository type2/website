Subject: RE: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

&gt; So how can we know exactly what PSI to put in our tire or should we go
&gt; entirely by the manual. I figured that the tire company would know best, but
&gt; they just list a max psi. How does the old owners manual know the type of tire
&gt; that we have. I just put Vanco's on my bus this week and the place the mounted
&gt; them put them all the way up to 65 psi. What do I need to lower them to?

Yes you need to lower them.
from my handy wog up to 3/4 load 28/35 full load 28/40

I dont know what year your bus is so check an appropriate manual to see if
yours is slightly different.

the tires are rated to handle our load at an appropriate pressure and
sidewall stiffness for handling.

the place that mounted them is dumb as dirt and should probably be closed
down.
