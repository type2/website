&gt; Can I use the left (driver's) side tie rod assembly for both sides?  I'm
&gt; getting ready to order new ones and it appears that Bus Depot offers the
&gt; left complete assembly only.

The driver's side (LHD) is non-adjustable and the passenger side is
adjustable.

It's correct to have one of each but you could use two adjustable ones. If
you put on two non-adjustable tie-rods I don't see how you are going to be
able to get the correct wheel toe.

&gt; Will this make alignment more complicated?  I plan on doing a rough
&gt; alignment before taking it to the shop.

They have both...

Tie Rod With Ends  
Adjustable

Tie Rod With Ends  
Non-Adjustable

...all of the vendor catalogs seem to use left and right in their
descriptions of those items as if you are looking at the front of the bus.
