&gt; 3)  Take a roll of duct tape and tape the crap out of every single tube
&gt; that carries hot air.  From the aux. blower in the engine compartment to
&gt; the bottom, underneath from the boxes to the accordian tubes that go to
&gt; the Y.  Mine was leaking plenty of air around the seams.  Is duct tape
&gt; the best way to do it?  Probably not, but that's never stopped me
&gt; before.

--&gt;  Duct tape will *probably* be okay, but you may want to consider metal
tape instead.  (Try the paint/homeowner's section at K-Mart or Wal-Mart,
where it's sometimes sold for patching gutters.)  It's kind of like
aluminum foil with strong stick-um on the back.  It has the advantage of
being nonflammable.  (Duct tape will burn quite well.)

It also makes a quick, temporary fix for minor exhaust leaks.  Smear
Permatex tailpipe sealer into the leak (usually, in my case, a bad
flange), lay a little bead of it on the sticky side of the metal tape, and
squish it on good.  It bends tightly around irregular surfaces (like those
exhaust flanges) and in combination with the sealer will usually hold for
a few weeks at least, especially if you wire brush all the loose crud off
first.  I've had better luck with this than with those fiberglass kits.

Taping ducts is one of the few things duct tape really isn't all that good
for. ;)
