The leak is on the outside of the case, but upon sniffing, it is not a 
strong smell of gas.  really doesn't smell like much at all so i'd assume 
its oil.  its not pouring out or leaking out the bottom of the engine tin.  
I just got the vacuum advance and new distributer not more than 5,000 miles 
ago
So do you say it may be leaking into the distributer shaft down into the 
case??  I probably can't tell unless I take the distributer out I guess.

I looked throught the idiots guide and all that.  but I'm not too good with 
the key words.  I prefer haynes?? for the troubleshooting in the front but 
they don't have troubleshooting on leaks.

I'd know if its gas right cuz it smell like it??

&gt; &gt;You may wonder why you engine is leaking in these places in the first
&gt; &gt;place, and I'll bet that you have excessive blow by - your piston rings

&gt;I had thought that M. Kim And Mike meant that he had a gas leak into the
&gt;distributor, i.e.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am leaking on the left side of my engine case.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt;had that happen before, but it was my carbs throttle shaft.
&gt;
&gt;I've had that happen before due to a ruptured diaphragm (I think that was
&gt;why). Clarification would be good, an oil leak is not good but it doesn't
&gt;hold a candle to a fuel leak...
