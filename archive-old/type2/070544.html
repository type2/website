&lt;&lt; Comments on this? At 3000km oilchanges, would this oil suffice? &gt;&gt;

Consumer Reports did an extensive review and evaluation of motor oil and 
other additives about 2 or 3 years ago.  Its release actually &quot;made the news&quot; 
because it was such a major project.  Their conclusions?

If I recall correctly, as long as the oil had the standard 
seals/certifications/ratings etc. there was NO appreciable difference in 
performance and engine wear from brand to brand.  They also determined that 
most additives are a waste of money.
