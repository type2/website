Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal Question

Go underneath and lubricate the pivot point. If that doesn't resolve the 
issue, you got a sticky, contaminated master cylinder. How filthy is the 
fluid?? Know if the problem is contamination, the whole system is 
contaminated. You can try flushing new fluid through the system. Do it 
twice a few days apart. Exercise the calipers each time. If that doesn't 
resolve all issues with no leaks, budget replacement of all cylinders, 
calipers and flex hoses. Do it all at once then flush and renew the fluid 
yearly and you will NEVER have another hydraulics issue.
