Subject: Re: Two color scheme - interior color ?

The 2-tone scheme in '68-'70 had only the roof and bumpers painted white
and the whole interior would be the lower body color.

In '71 the scheme was switched to bring the white down to the bottom edge
of the body line. Then this line would continue inside the door jamb as
shown in my web page below. At the bottom of the jamb this color would end
in the front corner and the hinge area would be white. The door itself as
well as the interior paint would be white. The lower body color would wrap
around the inside of the door only as far as the rubber seal.

&gt; Subject: Two color scheme - interior color ?
&gt;
&gt; Hello to you all...
&gt;
&gt; I know this may be a stupid question, but when using a two color scheme in a
&gt; '68 bus (for instance, blue and white) what should be the color for painting
&gt; it inside, before mounting the interior panels? Should it also be a two color
&gt; scheme, or only white (if white is the upper color)?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance...
&gt; Best regards from Portugal...
&gt; (It's hard for me to get help in this small country....)
