Subject: re: noisy elec.fuel pump

&gt;Today I just replaced my fuel pump on my 82
westy ...The new one is noisier than the one I
took out, I guess noisy doesn't mean it's going
bad...

I've had exactly this experience.  The noise is
probably caused by a clogged fuel filter.  The
problem was rust in the gas tank plugging my
filters.  I did about a zillion filter changes
and flushed the tank to no avail.  Bottom line
was that I had to replace the gas tank.  The good
news is the Busdepot has them pretty cheap,
though I would recommend coating the tank.  

Gas tank rust problems are real common on
vanagons.  Slushy salty muddy crud gets thrown on
top of the tank and they rust in the trough
section in the middle.  It's not a rough job to
pull the tank.  It can even be done without
lifting the bus in a pinch.
