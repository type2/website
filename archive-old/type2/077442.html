Subject: Battery cable, starter relay.

I have a 1980 Westy. I use it around Yuma Arizona in the summer when
the temperatures are well over 100 degrees. I always had a problem after
seventy or eighty miles driven at night when the starter wouldn't turn the 
engine
over. I would hit the starter switch and the volt meter would drop but 
nothing would happen. All the lights would work. I would have wait until the 
engine cooled down or push it for the engine to start.

I got partial relief when I substituted the VW 8 foot battery cable with a 
larger electric welding cable. This seemed to give less resistance. Oh yes, 
trying to fix the problem I replaced, starters, batteries, ignition switches, 
you name it.

I found the perfect answer, it was a Bosch WR1 Low Voltage Relay Kit.
It cost less than fifteen Dollars. This reduces the amount of voltage required
to run the starter to around 7 volts. It was easy to install and all my 
starting
problems went away.
