Subject: Re: Anyone heard of J-tubes to replace heaterboxes on 78?

&gt;I'm tired of paying 300 per side for heater boxes on my 78 Westy for minimal
&gt;heat in return. I've got a gas heater anyway. Has anyone seen/heard/have/know
&gt;of a company that is selling or manufacturing J-tubes to replace the boxes?
&gt;I would LOVE to get my hands on such a pair of critters.
&gt;Thanks!

I talked with someone at Euro-Race last winter and they said they may be
working on something like this in the future but not in production yet.
What we need is to create a demand for these items so they will be produced
for us lowly bus owners.  There is little doubt in my mind that the VW
market caters to the Bug crowd and we need some development here.  Bus
Boys???

I took a set of trashed heater boxes and basically removed the outer sheet
metal and inner aluminum casting to create &quot;straight&quot; pipes for my bus.
They aren't exactly full flow but they lighten things up at least.  Perhaps
for now the best we can do is to try local muffler shops who do custom
work.

Good Luck
