Subject: Re: [T2] Found a bus (Newbie again) is Dallas!  &amp; one more Q

My fault -- I caught that as soon as I read what I'd
sent too!  I meant fan belt...  Guess I just had
timing belts on my mind 'cause I've changed so many on
my other cars.

Anyway, it's being looked at now.  Maybe I can hope to
get away with heads only in the wake of an apparent
overheat?

Tks,

Chris

&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; Busses don't have timing belts, the cam is gear
&gt; driven. The seller doesn't know what he's talking
&gt; about, so beware. It may still be an OK deal if the
&gt; rest of the bus is good. It could turn out to be a
&gt; money pit. Keep looking.

&gt; &gt; Evening, folks -- I just got back from Dallas
&gt; where
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; found a bus.  I looked at Joe Mac's, but it was a
&gt; &gt; little far gone for my current abilities (keep in
&gt; &gt; mind
&gt; &gt; I am in the military, away from home and all my
&gt; &gt; tools), but I did talk to a friend who mentioned
&gt; &gt; seeing a bus at a local dealership.  We went and
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; look, and there were two buses: I wound up with a
&gt; &gt; pretty darned nice 71 bus with Westy interior
&gt; (incl
&gt; &gt; sink) but no pop-top for $600 cash (it even has a
&gt; &gt; clean, open title).  It needs head work, as the
&gt; &gt; timing
&gt; &gt; belt snapped on the highway, but the engine spins
&gt; &gt; freely.  I'm checking on rebuild options in Dallas
&gt; &gt; this week.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My friend wound up with the other bus (a 73 or so
&gt; &gt; transporter with nice interior and excellent body,
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; also bad head(s)) for $250.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do have one question, though...  the 71 I got
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; apparently been parked too near a tall curb, as
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; rear right side has a cleanm rip in the sheet
&gt; metal
&gt; &gt; and a big piece of the battery tray is missing,
&gt; &gt; leaving a hole in the engine compartment
&gt; underneath.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Will this negatively affect the air pressure/temp
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; the engine compartment to the point that I ought
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; worry about elding or somehoe covering it up
&gt; before
&gt; &gt; driving it a couple hours back to the base?  The
&gt; &gt; battery has been relocated to the other side of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; engine compartment, so that's not an issue at
&gt; &gt; current.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; More to follow when more time permits it...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks again for all the kind advice; you're all a
&gt; &gt; swell bunch!  8^)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Chris
