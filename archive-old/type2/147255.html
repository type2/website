Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus Opening fuel rail, need to block anything off

You'll spill a little bit of gas that's in the lines, but it won't drain 
the tank... at least it never has for me.  You might want to run it low 
so you don't have the weight of the fuel trying to force fuel out.

If you want to be on the super safe side, get yourself some fuel line 
clamps from your FLAPS like this:

or like this:

and stick those on your send and return lines and then you can play with 
your lines to your heart's content.

Make sure you have a fire extinguisher handy!!!!!

thanks,
mike
