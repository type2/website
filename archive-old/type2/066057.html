Subject: '73 Beetle - What to look for

I am going to look at a '73 Beetle, that the owner claims has 26,000=20
original miles, no rust. They want around $6000 for it.

If it really is all original its worth it, but if not, then no. Can you 

offer some tips as to how I can tell if everything is original.

thanks,
Patrick
