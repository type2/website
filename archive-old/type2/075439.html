Subject: Re: [T2] setting valves on rebuild problem

it's definitely not the cam... if i'm able to push the arm onto the pushrod
and get it free then it's something with the arm or maybe my pushrod is
bent?... i figure that if the cam was up, and the follower was pushed out
and thus the pushrod then i shouldn't be able to push on the bottom of the
rocker arm at all and get it open more at the tappet...

hmmm

&gt; On Fri, Bill Martin wrote (with very long lines):
&gt; &gt; so i went around to set the valves and in adjusting the number 3
&gt; &gt; intake valve i noticed that no matter how much i backed off the
&gt; &gt; tappet it still didn't come free of the valve so i couldn't get
&gt; &gt; any lash
&gt; &gt; i'm baffled... why would this be happening and does anyone have any
suggestions for solving this problem?
&gt;
&gt; how is the crank situated? i.e. could the cam be trying to actually push
&gt; the valve in question?. what effect does turning the crank have?
