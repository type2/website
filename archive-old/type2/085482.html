Subject: Re: [T2] How much material for Westy curtains?

My wife just made a lovely set for our '68.
I think she bought 10 meters (welcome to metric land).
My suggestion would be to get measurements for all windows, including front,
and driver/passenger. Remember many volks split the curtains for the side
windows in two. I would take all of these measurements and make small scale
copies out of paper.
Then I would find the fabric I like, and find out the WIDTH. This is
important because width varies ALOT! I would then figure out a creative way
of fitting the pieces on that width, allowing for 1&quot; seam allowances.
You will find that you can avoid wasting a lot of fabric.
Just remember to have he grain running the same on all pieces (draw little
arrows on your paper pieces).

Good luck!

Adam
