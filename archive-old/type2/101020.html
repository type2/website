Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

&gt; I live in Venezuela and we have a general strike since 30 days now as you can
&gt; figure everything is hard to find including gas. Since the gas you can find at
&gt; the gas stations are not certified I was guessing if I use an outboard mix I
&gt; have (40 parts gas 1 part two stroke oil).
&gt; I was wondering if this mix 20 liters plus 40 liters of regular gas could make
&gt; some damage to the engine or just some smoke.
&gt; Any advice will be highly appreciate, I don not planning to do this as a
&gt; regular basis but we are passing through a hard times

I would think that little bit of oil would probably not hurt an engine,
