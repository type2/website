&lt;&lt; i have a push button on the front of the driver seat (on the metal UNDER
the seat). it is next to a knob... i think it is the driver seat tilt
knob. but what if the theif isnt a complete moron? won't they think to
look for a button or switch when they can't get the car started?  &gt;&gt;

Any numbers on stolen busses from the list? Were they recovered and 
if so in what condition? I really can't see 'em stolen for joy rides...and
the resale can't be enough to warrant the time and effort of a pro
thief. Seems to leave only another unscrupulous bus owner looking for
cheap parts...?-(
