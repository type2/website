Subject: RE Valve Seat cutting
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

		&gt;Seeing as everyone else is talking about valves tonight....
		&gt;
		&gt;I bought a set of new 37.5x40 heads from Mark Stephens last
		&gt;year, but am finally getting around to working them over
		&gt;for installation. I ploshed up the really rough intake and
exaust
		&gt;ports to keep them clean and to help flow, and knocked the
		&gt;rough stuff off of the combustion chamber walls. I also
		&gt;stoned some major roughness off of the valve
		&gt;cover sealing surfaces.
		&gt;
		&gt;But, when I went to lapp in the valves I discovered that
		&gt;the seats have been cut to 60 degrees, while the
		&gt;valves are cut to 45 degrees. It looked like the Mark
Stephens
		&gt;guy did the first step of my 3 angle valve job and forgot
		&gt;steps 2 and three!! (I think I waited too long to bring it
		&gt;to their attention now)

	I would call Mark Stephens on it.  I just talked to them last week
and they
	seemed like reasonable people.  Since it is pretty obvious that they
made a
	mistake here, I don't think they would have a problem with making it
right,
	even if you've had the heads laying around for a few months.  I also
picked
	up a pair of heads from them - I think I'm gonna go pull the valves
and
	make sure mine match the seats.  :-/



	I had a really horrible experience with Mark Stephens on a rebuilt
2.0. I never did get satisfaction and am still fairly bitter about it. I
would be curious if they take care of you. I agree that this is their
problem and they should fix it. 

	Good Luck to you and I hope that things work out.
	Clay
