&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Wondering if the kid installed a 009 in his bus -- following Muir's advice&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; When John Muir used a 009 dist, he used them in pre 70 VWs, which they do
&amp;gt; actually work good in. I have a German one in my 65 Beetle (28 PICT carb)
&amp;gt; and it works great.

Well, &amp;quot;adequately&amp;quot; is a better description.  I use a 009 with a 30PICT-1
and it definitely needs a more educated foot than a vacuum carburator.
Muir said that the vacuum carbs were a sop for people who couldn't learn
to shift properly.  This is another way of saying that you need to really
spin the engine to keep the advance in while shifting to prevent bogging,
so the 009 wasn't really the bees' knees on early engines either.  If you
think in terms of the KISS principle like Muir, the 009 was great, but
heck, it's just one lousy vacuum hose, not a pentium computer!
