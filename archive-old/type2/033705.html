Subject: Re: Fair price Lets kill the thread

Obviously I'm the only one who thought this was a good idea, so lets kill it..

OTOH..if anyone wants to borrow my &quot;SPARE&quot; bus to tour Ontario Canada &quot;The great
white north&quot; next summer for a holiday, let me know...I'll try to accomodate you.

Good bussing gang...I can't believe nobody else is into sharing, when so many of
have more than one bus...but that's cool, I do understand...my #1 bus isn't a
&quot;loaner&quot; either.

&gt; I love my bus.

&gt; That's all I have to say.
