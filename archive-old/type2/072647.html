Subject: oil pump and cam choice: once again

I find myself in a situation from hell:  engines from three acvws
disassembled on the garage floor at the same time.  '71 Westy, '71 Ghia,
'79 bug  all decided to have problems within one month.  I am staring at
the piles of parts, taking a deep breath, and planning my way out of this
mess.

I have just measured the lift on all the cams and I am rejecting several
because the lift is many thousandths away from the stock .280 and .290
values.  I want to reuse some cams and oil pumps and buy new ones if
necessary.  I have read the archives on matching cam to pump and I am still
confused.

Is there a procedure for selecting a pump and a cam to match a particular
case?   Can I temporarily  install a pump and cam in a case half and tell
by looking/measuring if this combination is ok?   I would rather not rely
on such labels as&quot; bolts&quot; versus&quot; rivets&quot;, or dished versus flat.

Thanks, Jack
