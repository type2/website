[...]chances are it wasn't installed properly

The first (of three times!) I did this on my 78 I pulled the engine back out looked over the oil cooler, everything looked OK so I put it back on; re-installed EVERYTHING and it still leaked upon starting.  

Pulled the engine back out, looked over everything (again!), studied Haynes and Muir diagrams.  Turns out I had the washers for the bolts (and five pounds is the correct torqueage) INSIDE the oil cooler against the seals.  They were causing the leaks - I didn't know much about oil coolers (or bolts for that matter) then.....re-installed properly (with washers OUTSIDE the oil cooler) and hasn't leaked in 16K miles.

Hope this helps!
Mark
