I am surprised that I don't see any auto mechanics listed..... Maybe they 
are smarter than me??

I am a tech at a Mercedes-Benz only dealership. On weekends I am up in the 
hills or the high desert looking for that elusive yellow stuff. Yes, all I 
do is put gas in my Westy. Even with 241,000 miles on it, it is the most 
trouble-free vehicle I've owned. I don't carry tools or spare parts when I 
go prospecting.
