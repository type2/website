Subject: Re: door lock broken

I purchased a 76 bus from someone that NEVER oiled anything, including
the locks.  I took off the panels using a mini crowbar thing(about 5
inches long) and hooked it under all the little metal clips.  You should
stop by the store and pick up more because they will most likely break
when you take them off.  Get the rubber grommets too.

Then, I took off both the door handle and the lock mechanism from inside
the door(a pain).  For the door handle, you need allen wrenches and a
phillips screwdriver for the mechanism and I think that's it.  The
mechanism drops down when you remove everything.  After taking
everything out, you can just soak the lock mechanism in mineral spirits
to clean it of all the old dried up grease and oil.  In the mean time,
pull the barrel out of the lock handle and clean and grease the barrel. 
I don't think the grease will get in the barrel so it should be ok,
otherwise use graphite powder.  Do use graphite *inside* the barrel.

when the lock mechanism is soaked nice and thorough, clean off all the
gunk with a brush, let it dry, and then lubricate it nice.  I used
multipurpose grease, silicone would probably be good too; especially for
those hard to reach areas, a spray would have come in handy.

Reinstall and it should be much smoother.  It takes some finesse and
mighty agile hands to get it back into place.  It'll probably take you
about 3-4 hours for both doors if you're unexperienced at door locks
like me :)

Later,
Mike

&gt; Lately the pass. side door lock on my 68 single cab has been becoming harder
&gt; to open.  Not consistent, but happens enough to be irritating, I didnt think
&gt; it was going to unlock last time. I was hopeing someone could give me an idea
&gt; of what it might be, and what parts I might need to fix it before I take it
&gt; apart as I'm incredibly short on time, trying to repair our house, and would
&gt; like to have everything I need to do the repair on hand. Also any tips on
&gt; removing old, water damaged door pannels without completely trashing them
&gt; would be appreciated.
&gt; thanks!
