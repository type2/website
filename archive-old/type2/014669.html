Regarding people reacting to your bus. Actually not so much anymore, but I'm
driving it less
this summer. I used to fairly regularly have car loads of kids tell me they
wanted to buy my bus. I've 
even had people follow me to my destination to give me their name in case I
ever want to sell it.
However my wife gets waves, and honks almost every time she drives it,
'cause she's 
Blonde da- da dadada da da da!  

Someone mentioned getting hassled by &quot;big Truck types&quot; about your wimpy
non-viagra bus.
Here is my answer to that. Ask them if their truck is three ton, or a five
ton. When they explain that
it is just a half ton, look very surprised, and say &quot;What!? You mean that
big macho pickup of yours
can only carry HALF  as much as my cute little Volkswagen?? Noooo? I can'
believe that.&quot;
You'll then have to explain that your cute little Volkswagen is actually a 1
ton truck underneath, and
therefore is twice the truck theirs is. If they don't find an excuse to
leave soon, they usually find
part of their truck that need immediate polishing, or intense study;-)
