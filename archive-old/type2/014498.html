Hiya Ronnie,

OK, I'll say so..............Don't drive it till you get it fixed!  The brake 
warning light can indicate an imminent serious failure of the braking system. 
 That's bad enough in a normally loaded vehicle.  Add on all the construction 
stuff you're carting around and that is a recipe for disaster, my friend.  
Take a day off, put yourself behind a little, check out the entire system 
(especially that master cylinder), and save a life.  At least, you'll always 
have more time to work on the shack.
