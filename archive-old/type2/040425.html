Subject: Re: Hydraulic Lifters...

&gt; Guys,
&gt; I have a 75 bus, with non hydraulic lifters. Is it possible to replace
with
&gt; the auto adjusting lifters?

Yes you can. All you need is:
Lifters
Pushrods
The spacers and wave washers between the rocker arms. [get rid of the
springs]

I run this setup on my 77 for the past 63,000 miles on a solid lifter cam
with no problems. The original hydraulic lifter engine came with valve
springs that were heavier but I have no problems using solid-rated springs.
