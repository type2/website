I have a 78' deluxe campmobile which came with a a factory built gas heater.  The heater is located underneath the belly pan of the bus from what I gather, the eberspacher BN4 is located in the rear of the bus  Iam wondering what the make and model of this heater is and where I can obtain diagnostic and repair manuals for it.  Also, the heater is no longer working the other night it was functioning fine.  The heater usually runs for about a minute after the key is turned off, but it wouldn't go off for over a half hour,  the black cigar shaped fuse was pulled and nothing happened then the number 15 fuse was pulled and it turned off upon returning several hours later the heater functioned, but the next day it did not.  Can anyone with experience and knowledge about the heater please respond.  jTHANX-- TWA
