I use WD-40 or carb cleaner or whatever I have that is flammable and in a 
squirt can.

Someone posted carb cleaner is not flammable and I have to say all the 
varieties I have ever used were flammable.

If you don't believe me do the spray can and cigarette lighter trick and 
see if you don't get a flame shooter (just kidding - ain't safe!)

I did have a Fiat 131 that burst into flames when we were cleaning the carb 
with carb cleaner one day in Naples. The engine was off but hot (because we 
just parked it after running around town). Or was it running? It's been 6 
or 7 years. Anyhow it caught on fire. A quick shot of fire extinguisher and 
I had a big mess but the fire went right out.

The mess was from the white powder (baking soda?) and nothing at all was hurt.

On a bus it could be different with the gas tank right there too.

My preference would be to use WD-40. It isn't as flammable (susceptible to 
spark ignition) but I have found vacuum leaks all the same using it.

The other fluids (except starting fluid) would be fine in small quantities 
allowing it to evaporate away fairly often. With the engine running and the 
fan spinning there should be enough air movement to help it evaporate and 
dissipate quickly.

Starting fluid is just too volatile for my tastes - your tastes for 
excitement might be different. It's your bus at your place so your decision 
doesn't affect me...

Either way I suggest keeping a fire extinguisher around during this little 
adventure. If the fuel system is tight the fire that could start should 
just burn off the spray you are using. If there is alot of oil or fuel 
leaks then you'll quickly have more fun than you might want. In other words 
start with a good engine washing. Follow it up with proper replacement of 
your fuel lines. Then I'd start looking for vacuum leaks. Maybe you could 
make friends with the local fire department and maybe they would allow you 
to do your checks there with their equipment at hand and their 
supervision... &quot;You want to do WHAT???&quot; &lt;grin&gt;

I also recommend a Halon extinguisher for zero mess cleanups. I was given 
one when I cleaned out a basement for a retired lady. She said it was no 
good, just throw it away. The gauge said it was full, the bottle is heavy, 
and there was a factory seal still on the handle. I kept it. I don't think 
Halon is being made anymore and I think it settles into low lying spaces so 
be careful you don't displace the oxygen in an enclosed space and asphyxiate!

Hope this helps. Anyone wanna elaborate here?
