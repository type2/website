Subject: &quot;Bus!, bus!&quot;

Remember we were talking the other day about how kids love VW T2's? We were at
the market last night and a cute little kid (couldn't have been much more than
three years old!) saw our bus and lit up.. He was pointing at &quot;Dubya One&quot; and
saying, &quot;Bus!, Bus! Bus!!!!&quot; So cute!
