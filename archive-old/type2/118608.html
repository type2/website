Subject: [T2] #$%&amp;_at_ Exhaust AGAIN!!

&gt; The patient is a 1979 2.0L FI Westy with a 77-78 rebuilt engine -- oval
&gt; copper gaskets at the head, trapezoidal flanges at the exhaust, no CAT or
&gt; EGR.  The 1-2 head is missing 3 exhaust studs (pulled out completely), and
&gt; the 3-4 heat exchanger flange is no longer welded to the #3 header pipe.
&gt; Questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. If there are holes in the head where the studs used to be, can I just
&gt; thread new studs in, or do I need to drill to 10mm and use the step-stud?
&gt;
&gt; 2. I've never tapped threads into metal, let alone into the part of my car
&gt; that makes it go.  Which tools and methods are recommended?  What should I
&gt; avoid so I don't destroy my engine?
&gt;
&gt; 3. If a weld on a heat exchanger flange is broken, can I get it welded, or
&gt; do I need a new heat exchanger?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not looking forward to lying on my back and working over my head for
&gt; hours, but I have little choice.  In addition, I'm terrified of doing
&gt; something that will kill my engine and leave me with no transportation
while
&gt; I get my engine rebuilt.  Hopefully the power of the Mighty List can help
me
&gt; through this challenge.

Well, the very *best* method is to remove the heads and let a machine shop
with the proper tools do the job.  But you probably already know that.

If the steel studs have pulled out of the aluminum head then the holes that
are left behind are completely stripped,so putting new studs in old holes is
a Complete and Utter Waste of Time.

I've never done this particular job but my *guess* is that you can use
inserts that'll allow you to use standard studs.

I've drilled and tapped fresh holes in heads lying on my back and it *is*
difficult - impossible, really - to keep things perfectly straight, but you
have the advantage of having holes already in the head to work with that'll
guide you.  Probably the best thing to do is to go buy a &quot;kit&quot; of
correctly-sized inserts.  The kit will come with more inserts than you need,
an appropriately-sized tap and a driver for the inserts.  The kit will also
inform you what size drill bit you should use.  I'd be tempted to also buy
some drill bits just slightly a couple of sizes too small so I could
successively work my way up to the &quot;final&quot; diameter; it seems like it should
be easier to stay concentric with the original hole this way.  SHARP drill
bits tend to wander the least, so use new drill bits or good sharp ones.
Mark the bits with a &quot;flag&quot; of masking tape so you don't drill too deep.

The kit won't come with a tap wrench, so buy one of those too if you don't
have one.  Don't be tempted to use a standard wretch on the flats of the tap
to turn it; get the tap wrench.  Lubricate the tap and start it into the
hole.  The tap has a tapered &quot;nose&quot; so it should start up easily into the
hole.  You turn the tap clockwise to screw it into the hole, with the tap
cutting its own threads.  Steel taps cut aluminum fairly easily, but you'll
have to apply a good amount of torque.  After every 1 - 2 turns of the tap
back it off a quarter turn or so to break the shavings free, then continue.
It's a good idea to periodically unscrew the tap completely from the hole,
clean and relube, then start up again.  The tap doesn't drill its own hole
so once it hits bottom you'll know.

I'd guess you could get a good used heat exchanger cheaper than having it
welded.   I'd also be leery of how straight the resulting product might be.
