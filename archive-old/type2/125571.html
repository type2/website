Subject: RE: [T2] fuel line hoses

I just changed out all of mine not too long ago. Once ya' figure out how to get the hoses off the FI's it's not bad at all. My hoses onto the FI's were so bad the almost fell apart, so I had to use the ole' Dremel tool to get the cup thingie off so I could cut out the old line and put in a new one.

Might as well replace the FI's gaskets while your at it. Their like five bucks for the full set. Email me if you're still looking for a hand. I live in Tukwila, kinda by Burien. (Seattle subburbs for those from out of town) I've got rather a hectic schedule, but I'm more than happy to send pic's or help via Email. Or if your in a REALL fix, I can schedule some time. I'm no pro or anything, but as long as it's not TOO tricky, I'm a fairly handy guy. :) 

Cheers
Chris
