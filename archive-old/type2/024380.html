 Hi,

&gt; After seeing one of those little teeny outdoor propane radiant camping
&gt; heaters at a Wal-Mart, I thought, &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if there was
such
&gt; a thing that you could use on the inside of your camper that would
&gt; attach to the LP stove burner for its fuel source?&quot; 

 Best way to go is to use a heater like the Propex where the heat 
output is seperate from the combustion exhaust. This way you get
safe heat with no open flames, no combustion byproducts and no
hot spots for sleeping bags to fall on. These units are more 
expensive than a conventional radiant heater but usually include
thermostatic control, blower fans etc.

 Do some searches for Carver or Propex.

Cheers,
	W.
