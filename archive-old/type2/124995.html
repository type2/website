Subject: Friday - Bus sighting

Noticed during a commercial the other day that a woman was standing on top
of what appeared to be a pink bus with a pop top.  It was a woman-oriented
commercial of some sort.  I don't normally watch the commercials, as I'm
heavy on the mute button and can't stand most advertising.  Just happened to
notice this one when I glanced up.
