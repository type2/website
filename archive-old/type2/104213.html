I believe someone else has already mentioned that there are 3 on each CV
and go on every hole

&gt; and clamps on every hose - no vacuum leaks!!!!!!!!

there is a reason NOT to clamp every hose, if your engine should backfire
the hoses will blow off and my save your AFM.  if they are all clamped the
presure from a backfire would have no escape and stands a go chance of
breaking the flapper control in the air flom meter. 

I clamp only the ones that give me trouble and work loose (if any)
