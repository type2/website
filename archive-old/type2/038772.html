&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We want to convert to a doghouse cooler and we have several from other
&gt; engines we have but they need to be tested. We found an oil cooler tester
&gt; available through RMMW but they said it was out of stock and won't be in
&gt; until a certain date... that date keeps moving forward every time we call to
&gt; see if it's in!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know where else to get one of these testers??

It would be pretty easy to make one from a old cooler adapter.  Plug one
side and epoxy a valve stem into the other side (or drill and tap if you
want to be elegant about it).  Bolt it onto the prospective oil cooler
with the correct seals, then pressurize it with air.  If the air stays in,
the cooler is good.
