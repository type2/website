Subject: charging system tool
Message-ID: &lt;BKCKCPDHJIOBAAAA_at_hotbot_dot_com&gt;

 Sean's latest questions about his main battery again pointed out the need for everyone to have a charging system/battery test tool as one of the necessary tools in &quot;the box&quot;.  It just so happens that Radio Shack can help right now (I have no affiliation or interest other than Busses).  RS has a charging system tool (#22-112) on sale for $3.99 until the end of October.  Even though I already have one in my general tool box, I bought this one to have in the vehicle.  Too cheap a price not to.
