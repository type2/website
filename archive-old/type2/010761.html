Subject: pickling a new engine

I'd like to build a spare type4 engine for my bus, but the one I have in it
is just fine so it may be up to 10 years before I need the next one.

Is it possible to build a new engine, but in building, prepare it for long
term storage?  Would lubriplate on the bearings and oil/STP on the
cylinder/pistons/rings be ready for pre-start oil pressure in 10 years?

I know there have been deals in the past on some VW of Canada engines on the
list - I assume these have been sitting a while.  What do they do to keep
engines ready and fresh?

Thanks,
Dean
