Hey Mike,
I have a 2.0FI and I normally adjust it to 7.5 btdc with everything
attached (that's what bentley says).  I can pull off both of the hoses
and it won't make any difference at idle.  It's only when I let off the
throttle that I feel a significant amount of vacuum from the retard
hose.

&gt; &gt; Why would you disconnect the retard hose?
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Disconnect the retard hose and reset the idle to 7.5 degrees advance.  Adjust the carb
&gt; idle to 850 RPM and drive as the pre smog engines were designed to run.  I do not wish
&gt; to offend, but I find the air cooleds run cooler and longer without the smog controls
&gt; connected.  I also have had very good luck blocking off the central idle system and
&gt; balancing and adjusting both carbs as was the program on any multi carb engine.  This
&gt; is actually part of the initial carb set up proceedures before you get to the central
&gt; idle adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep Smiling,
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
