Subject: Road trip advice needed

I'm planning on taking a trip in my 77 westy the last week in April.
I'm in Buffalo, NY and I'm going to Daytona Beach, FL.

    I'm trying to go as cheap as possible, and one of the guys going
with me suggested that we stop at a rest area along the thruway for the
night.  I'm worried about how safe it would be to park there all night.
Specifically, there are two in North Carolina, north of Charlotte on Rt.
77.  Anyone from around there know about those stops?  Are they deserted
pieces of woods out of b-movie horror reels, or nice modern rest stops
with landscaping and restaurants?

    Also, I've got to change my oil there, because that's near the 700
mile mark.  Is that ok for a long trip, or should I change it more
often?  What else should I do before my first long trip in my bus?

    One more thing.  Is anyone going to be around Daytona Beach April
21-30?  I'll be camping on Ormond Beach (hopefully).

Thanks.
