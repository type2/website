&gt;In hopes that possibly  you  could offer some direction for me, I will let
you know what I've done so far.
&gt; Keep in mind I've just begun to learn about the automobile 9 weeks ago.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I replaced my points (and later found that I should replace points and
condensor
&gt; at the same time)...
&lt;snip&gt;

I'm new to engine mechanics myself, but have been working on tuning up my
1700 for a couple of weeks.  I've been told by several people that &quot;if
you're engine runs, the condenser is fine.&quot;  Apparently, if the condenser
isn't working, the engine wont run at all.  The procedure for replacing the
condenser is a little involved, so you might want to buy an extra one, but
not install it.

&gt; So, before all this, I got my bus to run alright without missing, which
&gt; it was doing from time to time. But, now, after new wires and plugs, it's
&gt; missing again! And I have decided not to time it again until I get a new
set
&gt; of &gt; points and condensor AND set my valves.
&gt; What d'you think? Comments? Wisdom to offer? Similar experiences with your
'72?

Well... since you asked.

I started my tune up by adjusting the valves.  If you've never done it
before, it isn't hard, but it is a PITA the first time.  I adjusted my
valves probably 7 times on 4 separate occasions in about 2 weeks.  It just
sucked.  But, you can benefit from my mistakes!

**** Below are my thoughts on how to adjust you're valves.  It is by NO
means 100% correct, which is why I've CC this email to the list, for editing
and hopefully some approval.  Check the list for responses, etc. before
attempting my instructions, just in case I've screwed up a thing or three.
Don't be offended by the nursemaid wordy as hell approach I took to writing
the instructions.   I teach people to use computers and in my opinion, the
more foolproof the better.  If my cat can't follow the instructions without
me around, I feel I've failed.

BTW I love your tagline!

MY VALVE ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE

You'll need:
    FIRE EXTINGUISHER (always have one beside the engine when you're working
on it!)
    2 new valve gaskets (make sure they're for your bus!)
    1 (or 2) good sized flathead screwdriver (to pop the valve cover clips
off)
    Molybdenum grease (help hold/seal the new gaskets to the valve covers)
    Feeler gauges: 0.006; 0.007; 0.008 inch
    10 millimeter box end wrench (to loosen the lock nuts)
    1 small to medium sized flathead (to make the adjustments)
    1 big adjustable wrench or a a 13/16 inch box wrench (to turn the engine
to TDC [Top Dead Center])
    Razor blade (to clean the contact surfaces of the heads and covers)
    Steel wool (to clean the contact surfaces of the heads and covers)
    Rags
    More rags
    A patient, kind, gentle, compassionate assistant, that is not offended
by foul language (there will be lots) comes in handy!
    OPTIONAL:  Replacement valve adjusting nuts and bolts - it cost me about
$8.50 for all 8.  If you don't have the $$$, plan extra time to remove and
clean each adjusting bolt &amp; locking nut before adjusting. You'll also need
some WD-40, rags  and some fresh oil to do this.  Clean with the WD-40 and a
rag, wipe them dry, oil the pieces, screw the back together and then back
into the rocker arm.  You'll end up having to adjust each one, but you'll
have the satisfaction of having doing a thorough job!  And the next
adjustments will probably be a lot easier.

Important Notes:
1. The engine MUST be STONE COLD (leave it overnight at least!)
2. Set emergency brake
3. Block tire
4. Take vehicle out of gear
5. It is better to have your valve gaps looser than tighter, if you can't
get them right on at 0.006 inches.
6. NEVER take valve covers off unless you have spare valve gaskets with you!
Never!  You'll thank me for this!  (If that wan't enough, trust ME on this
one.  I was stranded due to a valve gasket blowing out.  I recommend keeping
2 on hand at ALL times!

Procedure:
READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE STARTING!!!!  Then read them again.  Then read
them to your bus.  Make sure he/she understands too!

1. Go to the passenger side valve cover and examine it for oil leaks.  If
there are any, make a mental note of where you think it is leaking.

2. Using the big flathead screwdriver, slip it under (from above) the big
metal clip on the passenger side valve cover.  Pulling DOWN, slide the
retaining clip down off of the cover.  Remove the valve cover and the old
gasket.

3. Stop for a minute and examine the head for signs of oil leakage.  Look at
the area you thought oil might have been escaping the valve cover.  Look for
chips or pits, etc. in the raised ridge of the head that the gasket and
cover fit on.  Check the valve cover as well, for the same.  Make sure it is
nit dented, bent, or otherwise banged up.

4. Take your clean, un-soapy steel wool and clean the raised ridge of the
head to get all the old gasket, crap, schmutz, oil, whatever off of it.  Use
your rags to wipe it off and check it.  You want it smooth and clean!  Be
careful not to leave bits of steel wool and crap inside the open head
though!

5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the driver's side.

RECAP:  At this point both valve covers and gaskets should be off the bus.
The ridges on both heads should be nice, shiny and smooth.  If your heads
were leaking oil at the valve covers, you should now know why.  I.e. the
gasket was broken, chewed up, the valve cover's dinged up around the
seal,there's a big crack in your head, whatever.

6. Put your big adjustable wrench on the alternator nut and turn it (which
turns the fan belt which turns the crankshaft and thus the motor)
counter-clockwise until the notch on the crankshaft pulley is at the zero
degree mark on the scale.  It doesn't matter which cylinder is at TDC, as
long as one of them is, and one of them will be when the pulley notch is at
0.

NOTE: Pulling the oil dipstick out will give you more room with the wrench
to turn the engine.  If the car moves as you turn the engine, the car is in
gear!  Put it in neutral.  As you turn the engine, it will sometimes be easy
and other times be difficult, this is because you are compressing air/fuel
in a cylnder as you turn it.  You'll here it hiss as you move the engine
farther and the exhaust valves open, letting out the compressed air/gas.
This is normal.

7. Grab each rocker arm and tug on it a bit to see which one(s) have play
and which do not.  Taking your clean 0.006 feeler gauge out, slip it (if you
can) into the gap just behind the rocker arm adjusting screw and the rod of
the ones with play.

NOTE: I went through a ton of crap over this gap thing.  It is what caused
me to readjust my valves several times.  You want the 0.006 to go through
with drag.  A 0.007 (shouldn't) but can go through, but if it does it should
be with a serious drag.  A 0.008 shouldn't go in or through at all.  If this
is true of the gap your checking, then it is in proper adjustment.  Ideally,
you don't want the 0.007 to go through either, and to that I say good luck.
This doesn't seem too tough until you think about the difference in
thickness between 0.006 and 0.007.  Additionally, you've got to turn the
adjusting screw until it's just right and then hold it in place while to
tighten down the locking nut with the 10 mm wrench.  This inevitably moves
the adjusting screw and then your valves are too tight or loose.

MY solution: I put the 0.007 inch feeler guage in there and adjusted the
screw until the feeler came in and out with a serious drag.  I then ran the
0.006 through it to see how it felt and then tried the 0.008.  If the 0.006
went through ok and the 0.008 was a no go, then that was good enough for me.
I then put the 0.007 feeler gauge back into the gap, held the adjusting
screw steady with my medium flathead and tightened the locking nut down with
a 10mm boxend wrench.  After the locking nut was tight, I checked the gap
again with the 0.006 and the 0.008.  This gave me the best results with the
least amount of swearing!  Having the 0.007 in the gap helped keep the
adjusting screw from moving too much when I tightened the locknut.  I
considered using the 0.006, but knew the adjusting screw would move a little
and get tighter, and since too loose is ok and too tight is not, 0.007
seemed best.  I adjusted my valves again a couple of Saturday's ago and it
took less than an hour to do all of them!  However, when I first tried it,
Nikki's 6 hour valve adjust time (her 1st time too) was like an Olympic
record. : )

Some list Volks recommended a go-no-go feeler gauge that is 0.006 at one end
and 0.008 at the other end.  I don't have one, so you'll need to consult the
list about what it is and how it is used most effectively.

8.  Adjust what valves you can (the loose ones ONLY) on the one side, if
they need it.  Then go to the other side and do the same.  Keep track of
which valves you've checked/adjusted, so you don't do them twice.
Additionally, try and write down which were tight or loose, so you can keep
track of your valve 'health.'  When you do your next adjustment, if the same
valves keep coming up tight, it indicates a possible 'deeper' problem.  Ask
the list about that.

BASIC NOTE FROM KAREN who is a self-admitted ding-bat and still suffers from
the &quot;I don't want to just try something, cuz I might screw it up&quot; mentality:
To adjust the valves, first loosen the lock nut, by turning the nut
clockwise (righty-tighty lefty-loosy applies!), then you can turn the screw.
DON'T try to turn the screw until you've loosened the nut!!!  Otherwise
you'll just mess up your screw, and then you'll have to find someone to
drive you to a VW place to get the replacements (been there done that) and
that sucks.

RECAP:  You should now have checked/adjusted all the valve gaps on both
sides that had some play, i.e were at TDC.

9. Put Adjustable wrench on the alternator nut and turn it (which turns the
fan belt which turns the crankshaft and thus the motor) counter-clockwise
until the paint mark (exactly 180 degrees from the notch) on the crankshaft
pulley is at the zero degree mark on the scale above it.

10.  Repeat steps 7 and 8.

11.  Turn the crankshaft 180 degrees AGAIN, back to the notch.  Repeat Steps
7 - 8 AGAIN.

12.  Turn the crankshaft another 180 degrees, back to the paint mark, and
Repeat steps 7 &amp; 8 one more time.

NOTE:  It doesn't matter which way you turn the alternator nut, as long as
you ALWAYS TURN IT THE SAME WAY!

RECAP:  You have now adjusted all your valves.  It should have taken 4 half
turns of the pulley, alternating between notch and paint mark in the end.

13.  Take both your valve covers and clean them thoroughly.  Be sure to get
ALL the schmutz out of them.  There may be old glue on them from someone
gluing the gaskets in last time.  A razor blade comes in handy here.  Be
careful not to scratch them up though.  Use the steel wool on the inside
where the new gasket will go.  Don't leave any steel wool bits or crap on
the inside of the cover!

14.  Get your new gaskets and place them into your valve covers.  When you
know which way they fit into the covers, pull them out and put a light coat
of Molybdenum grease on the sides which go into the cover.  This will hold
them in place while you're putting the covers back on.

NOTE: Some people suggest using glue or such to hold the gasket into the
valve cover.  I, after pulling my covers off so many times in a short period
of time, disagree.  The light coat of grease will hold the covers in place
just fine when putting the covers on.  When you pull off the covers,
sometimes the gasket sticks to the head due to oil and compression.  If the
gasket is glued to the covers, they might tear.  Additionally, the gaskets
will eventually need to be replaced and having them glued to the covers
means you have to tear, scrape and scrub to get all the old one out.  Beyond
those reasons, I have a tendency to get sticky gluelike substances all over
the place, so I avoid them whenever possible.  Grease is just easier and
safer and you'll look sexier greased head to toe than with your finger glued
to your nostril.

15.  Put your vlave covers, with their new gaskets in them, back on the
heads and make sure they are seated nice and solid.  Use the big flathead
screwdriver to bring the retaining clips back up and in their notches on the
valve cover.  Do this to both sides.

16.  Put your dipstick back in and get your adjustable wrench and any other
tools out of the engine bay.

RECAP:  You've put your covers back on both sides with their new gaskets and
put the retaining clips back on them.  You've gotten your tools out of the
engine (!) and the bus is ready to be turned over.

17.  Start the bus in neutral and let it run.  Go to the driver's side valve
cover and watch it for oil dripping or leaking around the head.  If there
is, you'll need to pull the cover off and try and refit it.  (Turn off the
car first!)  I found both my cover's leaking so I flipped the valve covers
over (so the VW symbols were upside down) and put them back on, and that
fixed them both.  Also listen for a rythmic metalic 'tack tack tack' sound.
If you hear it, you're valves are too loose and you have to readjust them.
Go back to step 1.  Expect this.  Plan for this.  Remember, your engine has
to be STONE COLD, so you'll have to let it sit for a few hours at the
MINIMUM!!!

18.  If everything seems ok, go for a short drive.  Congratulate yourself!!!
Have a beer!  Have several!!!  Go to bed and sober up.

19.  Repeat step 17 (and 18) just to be sure.

That's it, you're valves are adjusted!


Well, you asked!!!!!!!!!

I hope these instructions will inspire many more complete, detailed and
exhaustive UBER-instructions from our list about how to do common jobs start
to finish, including a parts list.  I hope you can print this out, take it
to your FLAPS, get what you need with confidence and fix adjust your valves
with the printout alone.  I'd add pictures, but the I couldn't post it to
the list.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes!


NOTE TO LIST:  BE GENTLE!!!  We're just trying to help!!!
