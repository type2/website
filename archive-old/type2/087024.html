&gt; I've recently discovered an atf leak underneath my 1979 2.0L auto bay.
&gt; Does anyone know where the most common place/s these are likely to be 
&gt; leaking from and how can it be resolved ?

rear seal, change it everytime you have engine out, Bus Depot has em for
a few bucks.  One key point do not push them all the way in but they
should be flush with the top of the recess.
