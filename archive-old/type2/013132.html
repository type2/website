	OK I realize that this will be quite subjective,but how loud should
a 4 speed transmission in a 79 std be? I seem to hear quite a bit of
gear whine at low speeds, in al 4 gears. I suspect that this trany has
seen better days but would like to get an idea about the noise level &amp;
types of sounds I should hear. thanks
