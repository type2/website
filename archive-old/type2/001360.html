Subject: Web Page Updated-Pictures

Good Morning Folks,
      I just put some pictures of the nearly completed '77 up on my web
page. All I have left to do is install the sink cabinet, windshield, and new
canvas. I've read up on the canvas install, and I've already removed the old
canvas, but I would like to hear from others who've done their own canvas
replacement, any tips or tricks, what not to do, etc. I am also trying to
revive an old VW bus event, &quot;Buses Near The Bay&quot;, at Point Lookout in
Southern Maryland. Check out the link at the bottom of my page. Thanks!
Jeff
