Yo! If you want a new preassure plate to go with that clutch I've got one
real cheap. Brand new. $35.00.

&gt; &gt;  I'd like to throw in a
&gt; &gt; decent clutch disk while i'm at it. the current one
&gt; &gt; has about 20,000 miles on it,and probably had rear
&gt; &gt; seal oil leakage. Considering a partially &quot;used&quot; one.I
&gt; &gt; don't recall the size of the clutch just now.
&gt; 
&gt; Your 72 should have a 210mm clutch.
&gt; Look at the clutch cover [pressure plate], around it should be 
&gt; stamped '210' and
&gt; probably Sachs.
