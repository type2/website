Subject: Re: [T2] California Emisions ECU - can it work without 02
  sensor?

To answer your subject line, yes the ECU can work without the O2 sensor.
The O2 sensor is there to provide &quot;correction&quot; feedback to the ECU for
air/fuel mixture problems, but there's no reason why the vehicle won't work
just fine without it.  The ECU just isn't receiving that feedback.

There's a *whole lot* of differences between the California and Federal
engines, all of it having to do with what's hung on the engine itself.
There's different ECU's different AFM's, different wiring harnesses,
different distributors, different exhaust.  A Federal van will have the
series resistance pack mounted at the front of the engine compartment while
for California vans the series resistance is internal to the ECU.  You'll
see an ICU and idle stabilizer with a California van, while a Federal van
doesn't have this stuff.

Subject: [T2] California Emisions ECU - can it work without 02 sensor?

&gt; I have a 79 transporter which has a california exhaust system which leads
me
&gt; to believe that it was once a CA emmisions engine.  Ever since I have had
&gt; it, it has not used the O2 sensor which leads me to believe one of two
&gt; things:  the ECU is expecting an input from the 02 sensor and is not
getting
&gt; it; or somewhere in the life of the Van the ECU was changed out with a
&gt; non-CA emissions ECU.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a difference in ECUs between the CA and FED?  How can I tell what
&gt; type of ECU I have?
