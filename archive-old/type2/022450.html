Hi Dave, Thanks for your email.

As of the 1974 model year the head lamp washers became an option, 
M288. The system consisted of a large electric pump, a large oddly 
shaped water tank, a smaller electric pump for the window washers, 
a relay, a different switch,  and some additional wiring/plumbing/brackets. 
Both pumps were actuated by the wiper switch/stalk. The M288 wiper 
switch therefore must have an electric contact in it.(I've never seen one 
though) The partnumber of the switch is not listed on the VW fiches 
anymore. I want to use one of these switches for another purpose. 
Of course, I could always fabricate a contact onto my existing switch, 
but it would be nice if I could locate one of these switches. While I'm at 
it, I might as well CC this to the list, I just might get lucky :-) 

Thanks, 

Brian.
