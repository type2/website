Subject: Re: folding back seat for 73

Well, I know of several up here.
We are just West of Death Valley, not too far from you.
I think I'll go take some pics and post them for you.
Maybe not today, wind blowing and cooooooold!
As I recomember, , , ,The back seat that you are talking about is a whole
different package from the regular seat. It combines with the rear facing
seat  in back of the driver, and the fold down table to make a full size bed.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; I am looking for a back seat (one that will fold into a bed) for my
&gt; brother's '73 Bus. We live in Utah and would be willing to do a little
&gt; travel to pick one up. If anyone has an idea of where to buy one, please
&gt; e-mail us at buslover_at_vwbus_dot_org.
&gt;
&gt; P.S. We would love any pics or bus stories to add to our Web site.
