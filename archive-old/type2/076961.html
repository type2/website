Bessie: Our Grateful Dead Bus--
http://www.livingfolklore_dot_com/HTML/bessie.htm
Which we found in pieces in Jerome years ago and is now &quot;Back On the Glory
Road&quot;  Todate I have never been &quot;Stopped&quot; while on the road--I Actually have
received a lot of Thoumbs Up and &quot;Vs&quot; from the Law People!! Bessie even has
painting of Garcia on the one side-- I do have &quot;Veteran Plates&quot; on Bessie as
that might help--Also Every light is in working order--I Left Chicago in
1979 so &quot;uj&quot; was not at the last GD Concert--I was at a lot of concerts in
Evanston and Grant Park --Hendrickx,Joplin,Jefferson,Sly,BB,Etc.-- was able
to catch a lot of the greats--
Just received our Limited Edtiton of the Matchbox Bus with the graphics of
Bessie on both sides!! Very Kool--stay tuned for photos--keep on truckin--
