Good point - but I'd argue that it's not the listserv's responsibility to  
store the items referenced in its messages.  I know it would be  
convenient, though.

&gt; As for the argument that the &quot;load on the net&quot; would be wasteful... Load  
&gt; ont eh Type2 server maybe, the net can handle it.

That's why I just throw my trash out the window of the car.  Everyone does  
it, and some polluters are much worse.  Besides, I only throw out a little  
trash, and a burger wrapper isn't going to kill any whales.

&gt; would an e-mail message with text and a 2-3 pics be any larger than  
&gt; viewing an HTML webpage of the same size?

Each access would be roughly comparable - another good point.  But again  
the idea is to reduce the number of &quot;forced&quot; transmissions.

&gt; So we have the vocal minority deciding for the majority

That applies everywhere! :-)  No way to know if the ones debating the  
issue are a representative sample.  Sorta like Congress. :-)
else you're going to become a gallery admin.  Or point people to a  
reliable free service like webshots or iphoto.  Or samba.

Don't get me wrong - there is a wonderful visual element to working on  
Type 2s, and I want more of it.  I'd love to see all y'all's ugly mugs  
more often, see pix of your babies, your latest toys, how-tos, etc.  Email  
just isn't the proper medium for it.
