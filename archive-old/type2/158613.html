Subject: seat plans

i am looking to do redo the cargo area of my 78 transporter.   i was
wondering if anyone out there has a measured drawing of anything that they
have done.   i am really just looking for some ideas.  i plan to use birch
door panels and side panels. i would also like to use wood for the headliner
and would like some input on that also . thanks in advance.
richard
