Mike (and the List)

Over the past couple of days my spies have forwarded two of your messages.  
Both touched on -- and generally agreed with -- topics I've posted to the 
List.  The purpose of this message is offer additional insights folks may 
find of value.

With regard to the mass of valve train components, I tried some forced 
aluminum spring retainers.  Results were generally poor.  They showed signs 
of galling after only a few hours of use and the keepers on two had already 
sunk slightly, altering the installed-height of the spring.  I tossed them.

I haven't tried titanium keepers.  I'd like to but can't justify their cost,

what with a couple of coffee-cans of steel retainers rusting quietly under 
the bench :-)
---------------------------

In my article on valve springs I advocated the use of the lightest spring 
that would 'do the job', or words to that effect, putting the emphasis on 
equal spring tension on all eight valves.  While that won't get anyone into 
trouble with stock heads, if they are running larger than stock valves, a 
spring strong enough to 'do the job' could very well be in the 140 lb range,

due to the larger surface that must be sealed.

The article has earned me a number of negative comments, some obviously from

folks who sell lots of 'Heavy Duty' springs, steel push rods and other kewl 
stuff... that may have some value on the drag strip.  But for someone 
building a torquer for their bus, best I can say is run what ya' brung...   
IF you have firm evidence of float, THEN pull the heads and do something 
about it.  But the odds are, if your springs are at least minimum spec, you 
won't see any float at the rpms you'll be turning in a bus.  As for the push

rods, weigh them.  Then decide.  All of the steel push-rods I've used  (on 
high-output, high-rpm engines) are heavier than the stock aluminum push
rods. 
 If you don't need the added rigidity (which you don't), go for the lightest

possible push rod.  Longer aluminum push rods are available, if you're 
building a stroker.  Longer push rods typically come with only one ball-end 
swaged.  You determine the proper length for your engine then face the rods 
to that length less the ball-end, press in the steel ball-end and then swage

the shank.  Most automotive speed shops will be happy to do this, needing to

be told only the OVERALL length.

If you make up your own push rods be sure to CLEAN the interior before you 
press-in the end.

In the same vein, if you're using USED push rods and you don't know where 
they've been, dismantle them and scrub them out.  At the very least, rig a 
syphon, a couple of buckets and run a gallon of solvent through each push 
rod.  (Hint:  Use a hose that's a press-fit on the push rod.  Just syphon
the 
solvent back &amp; forth between the buckets, causing it to pass through a push 
rod along the way.  If you put your mind to it you'll see there's several 
ways to do this without getting a mouthful of solvent :-)

---------------------------------------------------

Regarding the valve train in general...  Over the last couple of months I've

had two people contact me about oil pump incompatibility problems.  This is
a 
topic that has been pretty much beat to death but it keeps cropping up so...

 During your pre-assembly, one of the standard checks is to insure proper 
camshaft end-play AND proper pump engagement &amp; fit.  The 'fit' part means 
using the proper pump in the proper crankcase.  Later model crankcases have 
larger oil passages and need the matching pump... which happens to need the 
dished-face cam.  (One of the people who contacted me lost an engine because

he wanted to save money by using his old flat-faced cam (and matching pump) 
in his NEW crankcase.  All universal replacement cases currently being 
manufactured use the big-hole pump.)  As per usual, some local 'expert' told

him it was okay to use an early pump in late case, so long as the cam 
matched.  (For those who haven't a clue as to what I'm talking about, get a 
copy of Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Overhaul Your Aircooled Volkswagen Engine&quot;  
About fifteen bux.  Cheep)

Re:  the 'Clean' article.

As you may recall, I've advocated the use of tri-sodium phoshate (TSP), 
sodium hydroxide (lye) and other household (!) chemicals for cleaning
certain 
parts.  But several people have written to say there is a commercial 
detergent using the brand-name of &quot;TSP&quot;... which proudly announces (in fine 
print on the back of the carton) &quot;This product contains NO trisodium 
phospate...&quot;  
 
Bottom line?  The stuff having 'TSP' as a brand-name simply doesn't cut it 
when it comes to removing paint &amp; grease. 

So try a paint store.  Real TSP is a standard cleaning product, used to
scrub 
painted surfaces before repainting.  (Houses only, please :-)  If it has
been 
forever banned (!) in your community (one feller insists that's the case in 
his town) then start reading the labels -- trisodium phosphate is also used 
in commercial dishwashing compound... and the stuff you pour in that little 
cup on the door :-)

(I suppose that means the tree-huggers have struck again.  We'll just have
to 
out wit the rascals :-)  

As to getting all that gunk out of the inside of your blower housing...
worse 
case I ever saw was a 40hp with a bad oil cooler... that had BEEN bad for 
years.  You could lift the entire engine by the blower housing -- the gunk 
had glued the cooler to the housing so tightly I had to heat it with a
torch. 
 I tossed it.  Had I needed to reuse it, I would have had to boil the thing 
in lye.  TSP is for regular jobs.  Lye is for when you're serious.  (Lye is 
also dangerous -- be cool.)

But as for cleaning blower housings in general, here's the Insight part:  It

lets them flow more air.  Nice things happen when the blower housing is
clean 
on the inside.   So you did good.  (Here, have a seegar :-)

-Bob Hoover

PS -- Blower housings are hell to paint.  Kinda funny, too.  You stand over 
here, blow the paint in over there and sure as hell, it blows out a hole and

hits you right in the face.  So I flooded it.  Thinned down some primer, 
about half &amp; half, just poured it in there.  Sloshed it around.  Hell of a 
mess.  Propped it up, let'er drip.  Gave it two coats.  Came out looking 
pretty good.  Even got some in to those voids by the heater outlets.  

Do it over some plastic, sloped down to a can.  Wipe down the drips before
it 
hardens up.  

I didn't paint it, not on the inside.  Just two good coats of anti-corrosion

primer.  The red shiny stuff (Corroless?)  Not too many folks look inside 
your blower housing... and the air don't seem to care :-)
