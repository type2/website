Subject: RE: [T2] RE locking gas cap for 71  Zanderbus

Virginia,

My 'other car' has a gas door that electrically locks with the rest of the
doors via a pin and solenoid. That's what I'd do (in conjunction with an
alarm system) given the time and money. Hint: look in a mid 80's BMW 5
series for parts, and grab the electric window regulators while you're in
there. You can possibly use them in your van or sell 'em to someone else on
the list.

I can't get to my van at the moment to look, but maybe you can rig something
up with a universal manual choke cable that you can access from inside the
van; route it around somewhere near the rear door. Or better yet, how about
a small latch of some type that is spring loaded; then you could use a
regular piece of wire and keep the visual pieces to a minimum. I've seen
small latches mounted in the frame of doors on boats and RV's... seems like
that might work nicely.  You'll have to modify the latch by attaching the
cable to the bolt. Hard part would be mounting the latch up inside near the
fill hose. It'll be much easier if you're a contortionist. Hmm... maybe I
won't go with electrics after all....

Sorry, no pictures, but if I didn't explain things clearly enough, email me
&amp; I'll try harder.

Hate the
thought of drilling a hole in my gas door to install a lock.  Anybody with a
picture of a neat installation they have done?  Am NOT going to have more
gravel in my tank this year!!!
