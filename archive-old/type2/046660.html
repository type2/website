hi
The 80-83 Air-cooled vanagon is a good
bus to have. I haven't seen very many that
have been well taken care of, but mine is definitely still in great shape for 20
years
on the original engine. The flat four engines are really durable, and I would
reccomend that 82.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;      I realize that this is the Type 2 list but I think it's applicaple.  I
&gt; just test drove a 82 Westy.  The first time I have ever driven a Vanagon.  I
&gt; have always had bays.  It seemed to be in very good shape.  Is there
&gt; anything different to look out for?  The heater blower does not work.  Where
&gt; is that located?  Is it a PITA to get to?  It seemed to drive &amp; shift nice.
&gt; A little more sluggish then my bay windows but I attribute that to the
&gt; weight.  Any hints or tips would be appreciated.  Thanks.
