Subject: RE: [T2] Rear/side window installation

I was Paul's helper last night. Has anyone noticed that West Coast Metric's rubber is softer than the cheaper rubber from Bus Depot? Is this a good thing - beyond the fact the softer seal was easier to me to install. 

My wife and I installed all of our windows without hitch but Paul's were a bear. I think the stirng might have been too small diameter and it seemed that the grooves in his rubber that the body lip seated in was too shallow to hold the string (as compared to the seals from West Coast Metric). 

I got really frustrated and want to get this glass installed and right.. 

Chris
