Subject: Re: Gear to cam bolt torque?

I would not file the idler shaft area, if you look c;losely there are
several peen marks that must stay there, to keep the shaft from
moving-(backing out and hitting the cam gear) We have to take some material
from the area sometimes, when using straight cut gears, but we do not like
to.

&gt; Thanks for the advice Jake. Without your assistance I may not have
&gt; noticed the
&gt; extremely close fit between the cam bolts and the oil pump. What would
&gt; you
&gt; consider safe clearance? Between the bolts and the back of the idler
&gt; gear of
&gt; the oil pump I have .035&quot;. The studs that hold the oil pump together are
&gt; so
&gt; close to the bolts that I can't get a .002&quot; feeler gauge between them.
&gt; these
&gt; measurements were done without the pump gasket installed and the cam
&gt; pushed
&gt; toward the pump. I don't have the equipment to spot face the gear but if
&gt; I
&gt; file the studs flush with the nuts that hold the pump together I should
&gt; have
&gt; about .045&quot; clearance. I could also file a little of the housing behind
&gt; the
&gt; idler gear if the current .035&quot; in that area is not enough. Your
&gt; thoughts on
&gt; this are much appreciated.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tom

&gt; &gt; We torque the aftermarket cam gear bolts to 14 Lb/ft
&gt; &gt; We prefer to use loctite on them also, as if it begins to loosen, you
&gt; WILL
&gt; &gt; have a bad day..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Be sure and check the oil pump to cambolt clearance as well, FAT uses
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; same gears as web, and we sometimes have clearance issues with the oil
&gt;
&gt; &gt; pump..If you do have some issues you can always spot face the cam gear
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; the bolt will countersink into it...No more than .030 is safe..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope this helps, good luck with that hydro grind.....
