Thanks for the reply.
One of the first things I did when I got my bus was to get two new front 
seats from a Junk yard. I believe that these are 75-77.
The drivers seat was a direct fit. The passengers seat came on a rotating 
base. I removed the rotation, and welded the track base into my bus.
I have to remove the head rests to use the front kiddy cot, not a big deal.
I did replace the tray &amp; tube in my icebox and do clean them.
