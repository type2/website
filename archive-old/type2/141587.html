Subject: RE: [T2] Hankook Tires are back!

&gt; I ended up getting Nokian Hakkapeliitta CQ tires for my
&gt;  bus last year - Bus Depot was out of the Vredesteins. 
&gt; They weren't cheap, but they were available locally.


Yes, I'd forgotten about the Nokians. Haven't tried them myself, but they
have an excellent reputation.
