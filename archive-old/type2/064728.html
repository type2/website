&gt; &gt;It's GREEN, DOES reduce oil temperature a SURPRISING
&gt; amount!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
&gt; &gt;
&gt;   Can you quantify that? I'm not looking for debate
&gt; just some numbers. Even if it was by feel you had
&gt; some criteria, right?

       Joel said he saw about a 20 degree (F) drop,
       I thought that was fanciful at best, but my
       oil temp. gauge told me exactly the same
       thing! I was amazed!

&gt;  Also, what kind of Kendall? Straight vis? Multi? Synthetic?

       20-50 &quot;normal&quot; oil, ie no synthetic
 
&gt;  What were you using before?

       Swore by Castrol, I'm never going back!
