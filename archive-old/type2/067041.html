Subject: Re: VW's spotted in media (TV azteca)

I was watching channel 19 this morning (Spanish channel; about 1/2 the
stations in the San Diego area are Spanish-only), when I saw a live news
report that showed about ten lime green beetle taxis with big numbers
painted on their roofs queued up at a taxi stand. In addition, they showed
several Mexican poptop baywindow buses driving around a traffic circle (a
rotary to those from Massachussets). Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out
much more than that they were talking about public transportation, as my
espanol is a little rusty. The only Spanish shows I can follow are variety
shows, like Sabado Gigante (Giant Saturday), and Warner Brothers cartoons.
Beverly Hills 90210 is easy to follow as well, because there is usually
nothing going on anyway (&quot;Hola, Senor Walsh. Como esta?&quot;). ;)
