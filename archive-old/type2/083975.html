Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Valve Cover

Swap the left and right valve covers; see if the leak follows.  If yes,
I'd suspect the valve cover.  If no, then look at the head sealing
surface.

Hope this helps

&gt; Heads are spotless motor only has 1200 miles. No gunk anywhere, I don't
&gt; ususally use any sealer on these things. I guess the cover must be warped?
&gt; Anyone got a nice valve cover? Left side bone dry...
