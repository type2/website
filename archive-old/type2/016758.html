&gt; Yep.  another few thousand miles, another pressure plate.
&gt; 
&gt; At least, I think its the PP again.  Last weekend in hartwell, I had lost
&gt; some pressure at the clutch pedal, as if perhaps teh cable had stretched
&gt; on me. 
 &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any recommendations for good quality clutches OTHER then
&gt; Sachs?  this is the third one in the 2 years 4 months that I've owned
&gt; Ichigo...
&gt; 
&gt; thanks...david
David:
I think it's not the pressure plate. Maybe the release fork, maybe not
enough bend in the cable housing, maybe binding on the clevis. What
exactly was wrong with the old pplate?
You do have all the right style parts matched up, right? (pplate, t-o
bearing, trans sleeve or none)
I'm not sure of the answer, but defective Sachs parts is WAY down on my
list.
