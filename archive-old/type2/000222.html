I suspect that my carb' may be fouled and need to be cleaned ....due to
various reasons I won't list..._dot_can I do this myself, or do I need an engine
scientist ?
Are there any issues such as air-tightness, fuel cut-off or any other
important things that I need to know.
I have thought about buying twins (Delorto/weber), do these need to be
fitted /tuned by a specialist ?
Can anyone suggest any recommended reading on this subject.
With thanks
