Subject: Re: [T2] Tire size

Is that data correct? Just curious about what seems, at first glance, to not 
make sense.

Bridgestone: 195 diameter is .1&quot; smaller than the 185, and is +14 revs/mile.

Yoko: 195 diameter is .1&quot; larger, and is only 1 rev/mile different.

The Yoko 195 is LARGER? And while a .1&quot; change produces 14 rev/mile 
difference in the Bridgestone, it only yields 1 rev/mile diffrence in the 
Yoko?


If there are more variables that need to be taken into account, that's fine.
*********************************************************************
Bridgestone 603v
185/14  25.7&quot; dia  811 rev/mile
195/75 14 25.6&quot; dia 825 rev/mile

But
Yoko 356
185/14  25.7&quot; dia   808 rev/mile (C)  809 (D)
195/75 14 25.8&quot; dia 808 rev/mile
