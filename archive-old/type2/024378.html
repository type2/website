 Hi,
	I'm no expert, but...	:-)

&gt; HEIGHT OF DOME: 0.073 inches
&gt; VERY APPROXIMATE DIAMETER OF DOME: 1.850 inches
&gt; EVEN MORE APPROXIMATE VOLUME OF DOME: 3.217CC (metric: cubic
centimeters)

 This doesn't make sense to me- the volume of a *cylinder* with height
0.073&quot; (.18cm) and diameter 1.85&quot; (4.7cm) would be:

 3.14 * 2.35 * 2.35 * 0.18 = 3.12 cc

 ... so your *dome* ought to have quite a bit less than this (I think
more
than 0.8 cc less).
 

&gt; Lets say 3.2cc (0.195 cubic inches) is the volume of the dome just
for kicks.

 OK. In that case we have an area of 3.14*4.65*4.65= 68 square
centimetres
To get a volume of 13.2cc we need 3.2/68=0.194 cm height, which is ~76 
Thou. That's pretty much the same as you got (.075&quot;).

 I think your calculations are correct, though I'm suspicious of your
dome volume. Maybe the suggestion of making a mould and measuring it's
capacity is a good idea?

 a 13.2cc change in volume _is_ pretty big: each cylinder has a swept
volume of 450cc so 13.2cc is about 3% but with a combustion chamber
volume of roughly 65cc the dish to dome change is affecting your
combustion chamber volume by 20% or so...

 I don't know what the best way round this is, but one possibility
that springs to mind is to try and swap/sell your pistons to
a 914-nut, as they are probably quite valuable to one of them, 
whereas 1800cc bus pistons arn't that valuable?
 You could maybe try the Rennlist 914 list at www.rennlist_dot_com.

&gt; I would happily (gleefully!) welcome someone checking my numbers - 
&gt; George L. : This sounds like a good question to teach conversion 
&gt; factors to some basic math students.

 A better question might be &quot;When are we going to go metric, so that
we don't have to?&quot; !!!! :-)

Cheers,
	W.
