Subject: Re: [T2] AC compressor question

Gary,

Switched mine over to a Sanden compressor last year.

Ron at BD sells a compressor and adapter plate, although tmy problems with 
it were well documented in the archives.  I believe that he had a batch 
that just weren't right...check with him and see if he and his supplier 
got it straightened out.

My Sanden is completely under the tin now.  I have promised pics, but it 
just hasn't happened yet.

Do you *really* have a VPC dealer installed or the DPC dealer 
installed(actually usually installed at the port rather than the dealer).

It makes a difference...if you have the VPC mount, I suspect that the 
Sanden might bolt right up to it with a little work.  I have a buddy that 
designed a lot of the system and his boss finally let him redesign
the mount in preparation for using a rotary compressor....the rotary never 
happened tho as they were still very expensive in 78 as compared to the 
York.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I want to upgrade to something like the NipponDenso 10PA17 swash plate
&gt; style. Does anybody know the exact make and model of a replacement

&gt; would rather buy a bolt on and spend my time flushing and flushing out the
