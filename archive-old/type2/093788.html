Subject: Re: [T2] SMOKE! - is this normal?

Very normal.  that is the purpose of that hose.  it puts the hot oil 
vapors into the carb where they get sucked in and burned off rather than 
into the atmosphere or worse (in the minor none eco sense) to condense 
all over your engine.

&gt; While attempting to sych my carbs last night, I noticed exhaust

&gt; cleaner out of car  )  Is this normal?
