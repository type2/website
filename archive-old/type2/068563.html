&gt;So, as my '59 got 31mpg when I was 20, ........
&gt;
&gt;My 73 with a 2l motor got ~ 22mpg fwy, 18 around town
&gt;
&gt;Why is my bug now getting 29mpg freeway, 25 mpg around town,  haven't got the
&gt;camper settles enough to report  a milage, hoping at ~ 25mpg.
&gt;
&gt;You have to consider well tuned?  size of motor?  transmission?   Gearing  is
&gt;crucial to milage.   A lower gear splittie trans has a slower top end, but
&gt;better milage, and vice versa.

Didn't the Model T Ford get about 25 mpg ?  &quot;We can put a man on da
moon, etc.&quot;  Not much progress in mpg, though - whatever car.
