&gt; yes, it is a common practice when you don't have the proper tools and keeps
&gt; the lines from collapsing but you need to ensure all the sand is out
&gt; afterwards.  works great on fuel line or even plumbing when necessary.


paul,

i've done it (bend metal pipe filled with sand), but never for brake lines.
maybe for making furniture or fixtures.

i guess a 5/16&quot; metal fuel pipe with no flares would be relatively do-able,
but i can't imagine how you'd even get the sand INTO a 3/16&quot; flared brake
line (the world's smallest funnel?, half an hour glass?), let alone getting
it out! 

introducing sand into a hydraulic system on purpose? not a good idea in my
book.
