If you've got enough drag to slow a properly functioning engine in a bus down
to 20 mph on a flat, the offending caliper, rotor, drum or bearing and its
associated housing would be so hot after a period you wouldn't be able to
touch it.  The wheel and tire itself would be hot, not to mention the smell
the burning pads would give off.

My money is on an engine problem.
