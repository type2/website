&gt; I was sure I'd heard a rod knock at idle with my 1 yr old purchase 79 
&gt; Westy,
&gt; but couldn't quite decide if it was an exhaust leak or whatever. 
&gt; Last night,
&gt; in preparation for the Puyallup VW show, the oil was changed, and lo 
&gt; and
&gt; behold, nice big flakes (one almost 1/4&quot;) of bearing material were 
&gt; lying in
&gt; the sump. :-( This engine had just had a top end rebuild, and the 
&gt; P.O. dork
&gt; must have not done the bottom end. It's an automatic, so guess what 
&gt; I get to
&gt; do this winter? What fun. :-(
&gt; Any comments, suggestions, opinions on doing this ? Any chance the 
&gt; mains are
&gt; gonna be ok and there is a way to test them? I thought maybe I could 
&gt; luck
&gt; out and just redo the rod bearings without splitting the case? (Ha 
&gt; ha, what
&gt; wishful thinking). Sorry guys and gals, just had to vent.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Courtney
