I've got a spare rear apron from a 71.  In good shape, yours for the
price of nothing (maybe a beer someday, eh?).  er, you pay shipping. 
I had got it to replace the apron on my '71 which has a bizarre series of
1/2&quot; horizontal nicks.  
We figured out that these little indentions appeared when the DPO was rear
ended and he tried to pry the bumper down with a screwdriver!  At first I
was intent on replacing the apron with this spare, then I decided to just
do some body filler, now I kind of like the story behind the 50-60 little
indentions.  I still need a rear bumper though, so if you get more than
one offer, let me know.

Anyway, the apron is in east Alabama. May be a pain to ship, but I'm game
to try.
