Subject: westy interiors &lt;my $0.02&gt;

IMHO the Westy interiors (while all offering their plusses and minusses) from 1976-&gt;1979 were the best utilisation 
of interior space. I especially like the feature of this era Westy's that allows the front passenger seat to swivel.

Visually the so-23 interiors from the 1959-61 were prolly visually the most appealing.

I must confess a certain affinity for the idea that westy employed on so 34/35 interiors that use the spare tire for 
the base of a table that can be situated outside of the car
