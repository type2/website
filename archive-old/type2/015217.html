I figure the best way to get along is to simply &quot;get along&quot; keep moving
forward.  By that I mean just drive the way you drive, and refuse to be
driven by the hoardes of un-relentless Fireball Roberts wanna be's!

I practice the following to control stress:
-I always smile and wave.
-I Listen to the engine as it raises and lowers as you register the gears. 
-I Try and figure out where that ever-present mysteriously elusive air leak
is coming from.
-I Decide how you want to sit, high in the saddle or low and slumped over
the wheel.
I keep my middle finger handy just in case I need to use it to make a
point.  This should be used only if you can handle the possible escalation
Example:Pulling into a gas station or parking lot and threatening to whip
each others ass.)

I want a bumper sticker that says 
				&quot;Drive Simply 
					so others 
				May Simply Drive&quot;.
