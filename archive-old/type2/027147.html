Caution is needed to taken with ibuprofen delivered to the system this way 
for it is difficult to monitor dosage.  There is a delivery system  using a 
non-steroidal (ie. ibuprofen, ketoprofen) placed in a cream(PLO) but it is 
dosed using either a syringe or by measuring the length of the bead from a 
tube.  The tablets you crushed were probably 200mg but someone may have 
800mg available for crushing.  The risk of using too much of this class of 
medication is a GI bleed, decreased kidney function or 
anti-coagulation/longer bleeding time/anemia.
