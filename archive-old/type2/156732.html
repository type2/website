Subject: RE: [T2] VW Bus jump...Will it ever stop????

Gezz...

Seems like some people are stressed out.. Or something... I simply ask a
question couple days ago.. And a guy told me.. NOT ANOTEHR TIRE QUESTION.. I
wasn't upset but just..spooked that this list have some poeple that dont
want to help or give useless info...

New people every day are suscribing to this list and the question will come
over and over again...

As for the list.. It's aswesome.. But the web site is hard (opnion here) to
navigate and to find info...Rather go to  &lt;outbind://47/www.rtwell_dot_com&gt;
www.rtwell_dot_com to find info.

Any how...

For you guys that dont want to answer or are board of the jumping bus... I
think you can keep your reply to yourself...just dont reply...
