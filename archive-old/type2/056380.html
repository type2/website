Hey ya'll

I LIKE my bus!!

I am no great mechanic  but I get alot of pleasure tinkering on my 71 bus,
especially when my kids are involved.  We scraped some cancer spots and
sealed them with POR-15 ( this stuff is the same or similar to a marine
product,  it is a primer/sealer for keels and center boards. I forget the
name. You paint the stuff right on the nastiest keel  and it sticks, it is
just as expensive).  We then painted over these small but too numerous spots
with matching paint. Hated to ruin the look, cause I bought the bus with a
good looking paint job   but rust  spots were there.   Lifted the front
rubber mat  and found alot of surface rust, but not seriously deep.  Will do
it soon.

Anyhow,  got the slideing door working easier   so the kids can let
themselves in and out,  used some old rubber trim from my first scavaged bus
to seal the rear hatch, and glued down some interior wall carpet.

Recovered the middle seat scavaged from the same bus  with the rubber.
Waiting to receive the back seat cover to finish off the seats.

 I LIKE my bus!!!
