Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody got a balljoint boot for a Type1? &amp;
  conditioning the boots.

I bought about 8 boots for the tierod-ends in my '70 type1 from either 
Wolfsburg West, or WCM.  They were extremely cheap.  Don't know about the 
balljoint boot prices though.  I agree with Courtney about the Silicone, but 
not the sprayable application of the substance.  Spray gets EVERYWHERE.  
There is a product called Sil-Glyde that is silicone gel.  It comes in a 
tube.  It works on dammned near everything you will need to lubricate.  
Great for keeping your doorjam from freezing to your rubber in colder 
climes.

Speaking of conditioning balljoint boots, has anyone got an extra lying 
around? They are for sale on various sites, but ridiculously priced, as much 
as a balljoint itself in some cases. I have a torn boot and have tried to 
mend it with various things, but of course it's a bandaid fix. I would 
appreciate anyone letting me know if they've seen a single one for sale or 
have a spare one kicking around off an old BJ. BTW, silicone spray is a good 
way to help preserve them. Glycerine is pretty messy, spray it with silicone 
instead spray instead. I used G.E. silicone spray which specifically says 
&quot;conditions rubber&quot;.
