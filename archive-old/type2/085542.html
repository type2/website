Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Electrical - wipers/rear window defroster

My 78 has three (counting from the left).  Two are black and the last one is
silver which is the door buzzer.

&gt; We're working towards being road worthy soon. Presently I am doing
&gt; electrical things. I've completed the headlight relays and a few days ago
&gt; removed all the VW stuff I was storing in the bus so I could work inside.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a while since I took it apart and I need some guidance.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone take a look at their '78 Westy and count the number of relay
&gt; boxes they have on the bottom of their fuse block?
&gt; 
&gt; I have space for one or two more relays. There is wiring there for at least
&gt; one relay. I have not investigated what the color codes on the wires this
&gt; week b/c I have not had the time. I know I can find the answer in Bentley
&gt; but can anyone set me straight from memory?
&gt; 
&gt; I have two options on my bus I have not checked for operation yet. One is
&gt; the rear window defroster. The other is that my bus is a Champagne Edition
&gt; and it has factory intermittent wipers. Does this option use a relay on the
&gt; fuse block? Is it the same relay as the blinker relay? Electrically it
&gt; would work - the relay is a closed switch with opens once the load heats
&gt; the contacts. The wipers would be the load and once the contacts open, the
&gt; wipers would make one sweep and then park just like the driver had turned
&gt; the wipers on and then off immediately in a basic bus without intermittent
&gt; wipers.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone investigated adapting the Golf or Jetta or Passat &quot;programmable&quot;
&gt; delay relay to the VW bus? I know it was discussed by one of the VW lists
&gt; at one time. Basically you install this relay and based on a process
&gt; involving how you turn the wipers on and off, you can set the delay.
&gt; 
&gt; I know JC Whipme has generic delay kits but I am interested in the VW version.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to any and all that can help.
