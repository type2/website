Subject: Friday-bus sighting on TV

Happy Friday all,

I spotted a bus on last Sunday's &quot;Malcom In the Middle&quot; 
on FOX. At the end of the episode, the instructor that 
teaches all the super smart geeky kids drives them home 
after they have suffered sever humiliation. He loads 
them into bay window bus (didn't get long enough look to 
determine year). At first glance it looks like s 
splitty, white paint above wasitline with red below and  
a  V on the nose. I imagine the epsiode will be re-run 
before the summer is over. It is the one in which the 
smart kids are forced into the schools &quot;general&quot; 
population, whacky chaos ensues.
