&gt; &gt; &gt; I just installed (2) Lobro brand boot kits and (2) Meisterstatz boot 
&gt; &gt; &gt; kits.  Interesting differences between kits.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Hmmm.  Meisterstatz.  Isn't that Joel?
&gt; 
&gt; An' we all thought he just played with the computer, go figger.
&gt; 
&gt; He's out back pouring rubber, hammering metal, baggin' up bolts, and 
&gt; slapping them into a box to suck out our hard earned mullah!
&gt; 
&gt; Tho at $16 bucks a pop, I don't think he's getting very rich.

Jeff,
Naw, I meant meisterstatz like mister statz (weakly statz)

Not as funny when you have to explain it :)

Take care,
Sean
