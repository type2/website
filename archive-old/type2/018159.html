 &gt;HOW MUCH WILL MY BRAKE PERFORMANCE BE REDUCED BY DISABLING THE BRAKE 
BOOSTER? 

It'll be like the old style brakes before power assist. If you want 
percentages I don't know. 

 &gt;WILL DISABLING THE BOOSTER MESS UP THE BOOSTER IF I WANT TO USE IT LATER? 

I don't think so. As long as your Master Cylinder works okay - a broken one 
will leak fluid into the servo and ruin the servo.

&gt;Can you put a late model beetle 1600DP case in a 1970 SC? 

Sure, buy the adaptor bracket which will allow you to use your Type 1 motor 
in your Type II bus.

&gt;The mounting holes appear to be on the case of the 1776 motor but they are 
filled or plugged off.

The adaptor bracket bolts to the Stock oil pump cover plate and one case 
mating fastener underneath it. Sometimes you 
have to lengthen the oil pump cover studs.

&gt; Additionally, the 1776 has a full flow oil filter, incompatible with that 
rear engine mounting cross member!! 
&gt;Is there anyway I can make this configuration work?

I don't know. That sounds custom. Maybe someone else has done it, or worse 
comes to worse, switch back to stock oil flow.
