Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

Well I removed the starter and the engine won't budge at all!!! I can't turn
it, even on the fan hub bolt. I didn't think to turn the engine at all,
before I installed it.

We had to wrestle it a little bit at first, thinking that the splines
weren't lined up. It wouldn't go the last inch or so, but after jacking the
engine up a bit it slid in.

Would the larger flywheel keep the engine from moving at all? Buying another
starter isn't going to fix this is it? Because the engine should turn freely
with the starter removed right?

I guess I have no choice but to drop the new engine. Shouldn't the guy who
recommended the 228 mm have told me I would have issues here? I actually
asked for the 215mm and he told me I should use the 228.

Thanks for all the help so far.

I am gonna have a beer and cry now.

&gt; I am assuming you mean the starter spins but does not engage the flywheel?
&gt; If yes, are you still using the 72 starter?
&gt; If yes, it will not work. You 1st need to try a 76 and up starter. The
drive
&gt; is longer. Up to the 2.0L, the teeth on the drive are at the sprague
&gt; [over-running clutch]. On the 2.0L there is a 1/2&quot; blank space between the
&gt; teeth and the sprague. The teeth stick out further. This is also why you
&gt; cannot use the SR17X self supporting starter on a 2.0L manual trans, but
you
&gt; can on the auto trans.
&gt; I would try the starter and if it did not fix it, then the other fix would
be
&gt; a 210 or 215 flywheel.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I just finished installing my rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine in my 72 Westy.
On
&gt; &gt; the suggestion of GoWesty I went with the bigger clutch AND flywheel,
the
&gt; &gt; 228mm.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well now I am trying to start my engine for the first time and the
starter
&gt; &gt; &quot;fires&quot; but it won't engage or turn the engine. The engine went in fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this because I have a starter for my 72 (210mm flywheel) and now I
have a
&gt; &gt; bigger clutch? I sure hope so. Do I have to get a different starter?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The starter doesn't spin freely, but its also not turning the engine. We
&gt; &gt; can't seem to turn the engine over with a wrench either!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the help!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here are some pics I put up now that its in. However I can't get it to
&gt; &gt; start:
