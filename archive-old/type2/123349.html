Subject: Re: brake line fittings anti-sieze

In my experience the threads are not what seizes up on brake line
fittings. Its the sealing surface between the barrel and the line. When I
attach brake lines that have not been touched in years I spray rust
solvent at them, wait awhile, and then run a scribe in the crack there to
break the rust. Sometimes it has to be repeated but I'm almost always
successful. If you don't get that seal broken you end up twisting the line
into a pretzel.
