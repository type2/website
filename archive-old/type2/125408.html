Subject: [VB] Suggestions for tracking battery drain?


&gt; Anyone have any suggestions on methods for tracking a battery drain?  All
of a
&gt; sudden the battery is dead after two or three days.  The battery is new,
less
&gt; than a few hours of run time and few starts.  Nothing has really been
hooked
&gt; up lately.  The is on my Bus that's not on the road yet.
