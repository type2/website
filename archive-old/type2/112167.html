Subject: FI question

Hi all,
 Last week I picked up a 78 Westy w/two truck loads of
2000cc engines and a &quot;bunch&quot; of FI stuff. The guy I
got em from used to live/work in Belize(SP) Mexico. He
said people would bring him a new bus to have him
convert it over to an upright 1600 for ease of getting
parts .... but thats another story...
 In the 78 is a blown, carbed 2000... but in the stash
of stuff is a complete &quot;new&quot; FI 2000... but all the
air cleaners (AFM), and ECU's are all jumbled up in
boxes.... so my question is, if the engine is a GE,
what part number am I lookin for for the AFM and ECU?
 Been all over the net, and to venders, but all it
does is confuse me more...keep gettin 3 different
answers for every question... I think just havin the
knowledge that its a GE engine would tell me... but
mabey not...
 TIA for any info/help

Dave
62 SC (the truck)
78 Westy (the dead dudes bus)
