Subject: fuel line replacement writeup 

Job: Complete Fuel Line Replacement

Application: Fuel injected bus 75-79

M = Meters
MM = Milimeters
&quot; = Inches
&quot;rails&quot; = metal fuel lines
&quot;#_&quot; = cylinder noted

front is front in the engine compartment

READ ALL THE WAY THRU THIS FIRST

Parts:

5gal bucket
(Fits under my bus barely to drain the gas.)

Rags for gas leaks and a fire extinguisher.

8 - Injector seals (4 large, 4 small)
(Spend the money on OEM if you're replacing, the aftermarket ones are ill-fitting)

3M - 7.5MM high pressure (35psi) fuel line 
(Mercedes Benz P/N 916030-000527)(try MB dealership or european auto repair shop)

6&quot; - 10MM low pressure fuel line
(I used 5/8&quot;)

30 - 7.5MM Clamps
(NOT &quot;Gates&quot; style with the exposed screwdrive, holes in the band. Get the ones that have a solid band of metal (MB). They're a dollar each but worth it.)(MB dealer or euro auto repair shop)

2 - 10MM Clamps
(I used the old style here as there's only 2 and you get a good close look at 'em everytime you replace the filter.)

1 - New Filter
(Fram # G3743 apparently has the 10MM outlet to match the pump inlet, which the filters I've been buying don't. They're 7MM inlet/outlet, which is problematic with the hose.)

Sandpaper
(I cleaned the dirt/scum of my rails and they look great)

Pressure Guage
(35psi for testing lines, pump, regulator)

Procedure:

1. Drain tank. Disconnect Battery for fire safety.

(If a tank removal/flushing/restoration is in your mind, now is the time. Why flow old crap into your new lines/filter?)

2. Remove &amp; replace lines in engine compartment.

(Why only engine compartment? I saved the lines to/from the tank which go thru the firewall &amp; under the bus for last so I'd only have to go under the bus once. If you follow the lines like a map, from tank outlet to tank return, you'll be under there twice, but this may be more comfortable for some people.)

3. Behind #3cyl (left front of engine) a metal rail comes thru the firewall below the f.i. relays, start here. Follow the combination metal/rubber lines around the engine to see the scope of your task as it hits #3, #4, the cold start vavle (if you have it), #1, #2, pressure reulator, thru the firewall to tank return.

4. Unscrew old clamps. Discard these! If the old lines are hard to get off, grab a stanley knife and slit them lengthwise from their ends on the rails. Expect some fuel leakage.

5. Replace each piece as you go, use each piece of your old fuel line as it comes off as a template for the new line's length. Make nice square cuts in the new hose. Sand the crud off the metal rails as they become available, they're shiny underneath.

6. When installing new line, place the clamp fully open on the hose first. Slip the hose over the flares on the metal lines far enough so that the clamp can slide over the flare with the hose on it(tight!) and have plenty of hose to clamp on the far side of the flare. Rotate your hoses before you tighten so that you can use their natural bend in a manner that facillitates routing. Sometimes the hoses are hard to fit, but stay away from lubricants, this is your fuel system. NO SOAP!

7. Got the first piece of rubber on the firewall supply rail? Good. Don't attach it to the #3/4 injector rail yet because you should assemble the injectors to the rail first as a sub-assembly. Don't try this in the engine compartment, it's too tight. I found getting hose on the injectors themselves do be the most difficult task. Tight fit, and I had to remove the injectors from their mounting points to do it. Replace seals if necessary. I reused mine.

8. #3/4 rail connected to firewall rail? Now for the cold start connections. The cold start valve is sorta delicate, so don't muscle it too hard. It's also one of the more accessible parts of this job.

9. Cold start done? Now we get to the #1/2 cylinders where junk is in the way bigtime. Remove the airbox for working room. I disconnected my f.i. harness and some vacuum hoses for working room/routing. Mark everything you take off for later reinstallation. Be careful here, I knocked the f.i. computer ground wires off the engine block while doing this and couldn't start my bus for three weeks till I found them. Reinstall disconnected equipment immediately so you don't forget it.

10. #1/2 rail remove/replace is typical to #3/4 rail, but in a tighter space.

11. #1/2 rail to pressure regulator, not a bad job.

12. That's all for the engine compartment. While here, disconnect the tank supply/return from where they enter the engine compartment if you have't already. Working under the bus, remove the return hose coming the #1/2 side of the engine to the tank. There are several clips under the bus that hold it, find them if your old line is hanging so the new line won't be. This is the longest length of line to replace.

13. Finally, the supply from the tank to the engine compartment. This include the fuel pump and filter, and also has mounting clips under the bus. Remove and replace all the rubber and the filter.

14. Your fuel path should now be complete. Check ALL the clamps and connections again. Verify all disconnect equipment is reconnected. With a 7MM box wrench, remove the bolt in the fuel rail between #3/4. This is where you attach your fuel gauge. I had to cut the fitting off the gauge I bought and shove the hose on it with a clamp.

15. Add some gas for a test run. Don't fill up, what if you're leaking somewhere? I added about 3 gal.

16. Bus starts? Pressure gauge 28-33psi? Awesome. No start? Call someone else.
