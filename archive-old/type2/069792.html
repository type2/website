&gt; There's gotta be some way, right?  I mean, the speedo reads to 70, and they
&gt; wouldn't just play with you like that... would they?  Those wily Germans!
&gt; 
&gt; 

My first VW was an '81 Rabbit (Golf for those of you in the rest of the 
world) diesel.  The speedometer went to 105mph.  I can't speak about the top 
speed of these cars when new, but when I bought mine (at 258,000 miles), 
it wasn't capable of maintaining 105 *kilometers* per hour on flat 
ground.  But hey, it only cost me US$1.00 and I got 50k miles out of it.  
Besides, it's the car that got me hooked on VWs.  Hope to someday own a 
Vanagon diesel as a companion to spike.

As a side note, I'm working on a web page about my bus.  No pictures yet, 
and what's there is just random ramblings, but feel free to check it out.

Also, for those who may be interested:  Gabriele Autoplace (formerly F-A 
Motors) in Rochester, NY has what looks like a really nice '73 Ghia on 
the lot.  Dunno if it's for sale or what kind of shape it's in, and I 
wouldn't do business with them (previous bad experiences), but I figured 
I'd let people know.  They're one of the few VW dealers in the area.
