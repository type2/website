Hi all - can't help adding to this thread.  I only know about four things
when it comes to a good running engine, regardless of temp. Proper timing,
proper valve adjustment, well adjusted carb including the choke, and an
almost religious attention to using the right type of oil and changing it
every 2,000 miles or so.  I believe that when all these elements are in
sync a warm up period is the least thing to worry about.  Once oil pressure
is up - go moderately.

As for the Muir vs. VW debate - it doesn't make much sense to compare or
contrast these sources since they are directed at two entirely different
audiences. I have yet to find the 'definitive' source for doing 'your own
work on a VW' (or any vehicle).  I borrow from many sources with careful
consideration and usually do ok. When each of us decides to do our own work
on our buses we accept an element of risk. Some advice from just about any
source has failed me from time to time. What makes it all work is learning
from the adventure.

Regards:)
