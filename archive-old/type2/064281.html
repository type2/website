Subject: recently rebuilt starter/solenoid sticking? [plus carb thanks]

Greetings everyone: 

Last spring, I put a rebuilt starter/solenoid into the 1971 engine on my
1970 bus.  Two days ago, the thing began sticking.  Sometimes I had to hit
the key three or four times, sometimes it started right off--and sometimes
it just wouldn't play ball.  Nothing I couldn't fix by whacking it sharply
with a 15&quot; length of wooden clothes rod, but doing that downtown on
Broadway in a coat and tie is undignified. 

Any thoughts on why a newly rebuilt starter would be doing this?  

Only other possibly-relevant details that come to mind right now: I put in
a new battery at the same time as the starter; and the brass sleeve from
the old unit would NOT come out, and so rather than booger something up in
there and regret it I chose to reassemble with the old sleeve in place and
hope I wouldn't regret it.  I don't know anything about the place I got it
from, except that it had what I needed in stock at a better price than the
other places I got prices from, and nothing that they said/did set off any
alarm bells with me. 

And finally--thanks to all on the list who offered me advice and
encouragement in my first carb rebuild.  It worked like a charm, and did
much for bonding me with my bus.  Although, as I threw a piece of clean
carpet under the bus this afternoon to shimmy underneath and whack the
starter, it occured to me that bus-bonding is a road that you can't really
go back on, once you've started down it.  Guess that's not a real news
flash here, is it?  Ah well. 

best

p.s.  The pisser is that I just this morning finally got the inline fan
working on my defroster vents, and was feeling very full of myself about
that.  Now if I only had the right exhaust/muffler/tailpipe on, so I could
hook up the heat ducts to the heat exchangers and have something useful
for the fan to blow...
