&gt; I am about to replace the complete axle (CV-CV)on both sides of
&gt; my 77 camper, standard.
&gt; all of my books are being borrowed, and have not been returned
&gt; (so much for being the nice guy).
&gt; so , my question is, do I have to remove the wheel? Or can I just
&gt; unbolt it and shove the new one in?

The first thing to do is get everything nice and clean before you
unbolt anything!  The outside of the CVs and the hub flanges are
particularly important, as it is very easy to transfer grunge into the
new CVs.

You don't have to remove the wheel.  Things go very easy if you use a
small floor jack to jack the hub carrier at the shock absorber  monnt.
 This reduces the angle of the CVs (compared to normal jacking points)
and makes it easier to install them.

Get extra CV grease and put some into the hollows of the hub flanges
on the axle and transmission.

Since you have a complete axle, I'll forgo the CV remove/install part.
 Just be happy you don't have to do it this time!

Oh, and only lend out your Chilton manual :)
