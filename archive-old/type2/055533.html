Subject: Type2 3D mesh 

Hi Scott
	Yes, there is a 3d mesh. A company called REM infografica has it. It's
based on the Solido 1/19 scale kombi. They have a nice website.
 But I believe you have to be a member to buy the mesh, it comes with all
texture maps and everything. They also have a bug, karmann ghia kubel and
scwimmwagen &lt;i think&gt;. they got hired ie subsidised by the spanish govt to
recreate the history of the world in 3d models. Nice stuff and very
reasonably priced. I tried building one out of dimension sheets I got from
Thom's Vintage bus site, but I got loaded down with other projects and
haven't finished it yet, I was hoping to have it insanely detailed (engine,
suspension, speedo face etc....) but it takes time....
Cheers.
