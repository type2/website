Subject: SO-62 and Bulkhead Questions

Hello Fellow Listers!

Last year at one of the shows there was a '61 (I believe) westy with a
SO-62 interior. This interior is different from any westy interior I had
seen before, and one of its distinguishing features was that the front
bench seat flipped over so that it would face backwards into the cargo
area. This provides a great deal more floor space than other interiors.

My question is, did Westfalia have to cut the bulkhead(s) out to
accomplish this, or did VW send the buses to WF without the bulkheads? I
would think that the bulkhead has to contribute to the rigidity of the
bus, and even provide some side impact protection.

Any thoughts on this? Also, James wants to know if anyone has a SO-62
interior he could aquire for his 67 Dormobile (yeah, right!)...
