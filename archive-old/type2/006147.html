Bob,

Unless someone has removed it, the 110v to 12 v transformer should be in the
locker below the rear seat.  The frig runs only on 12v power, supplied
either from the 2nd battery or the 110 to 12v transformer.

There are 2 fuses to check.  One in the the control panel and one in the
transformer.  The transformer also has an on/off switch that looks like a
breaker.

The only transformer related problem I've had is overheating of the
transformer and blowing fuses.  Has anyone else had this problem?

&gt;Hi Volks......Here's the situation.  I have a '79 westy and the
&gt;converter that recharges my second battery (when I'm hooked up to &quot;shore
&gt;power&quot;) doesn't seem to be working.  Also, the refrig doesn't work when I'm
connected to 110v power UNLESS the timer (used only when recharging the 2nd
battery) is turned on.  So.....what's up with that?

&gt;Is the converter on the fritz?
&gt;
&gt;I pulled off the panel for the frig controls and all seems in
&gt;order....but where exactly is the 110 to 12v converter located?
&gt;
&gt;All help is, of course, greatly appreciated!
