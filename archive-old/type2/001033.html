Mike Writes:

the boot is not straight on from the throttle body to the intake manifold
tube but almost a Z.

Hey Mike,

When I replaced the longblock on mine I had the same problem. I tried
swapping them from side to side but no luck! I was exasperated!

So, I bent them.

It bothered me, but I did it.

I was worried that bending would somehow break the seal between the tube and
the casting. I looked and it appeared as if the tube was just pressed into
the casting and secured with a spot weld.

But I could see no other solution. I bent them, and aligned the tubes and
manifold perfectly. I used new rubber connectors (from the Bus Depot,
completely original, except beautiful and new), and it worked wonderfully.

I suspect that the tubes *may* be brazed as well as spot welded, to allow
for alignment. Maybe I am wrong, or maybe I am lucky. I don't know because I
didn't have an extra set to saw apart.
