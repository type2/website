Hey Everyone,

I am new to the list and this is my first post.  Recently my '78 Bus has 
need some TLC, which I have tried to administer with my limited 
mechanical knowledge.

Recently I had a problem with the alternator light coming on and then 
the engine immediately dying.  I could restart the engine and the 
problem only occurred when I was slowing down and almost stopped.  

I tried first replacing the alternator belt, which seemed to temporarily 
alleviate the problem.  Next, I cleaned the battery terminals and cables 
and that seemed to temporarily stop the problem.  

This morning, however, the light came on and the engine died a few times 
while I was driving in a residential neighborhood with lots of starts 
and stops.

The battery seems to be charging okay and the car starts fine, so I am 
not sure if it is an alternator problem.  

Any ideas?

I much appreciate the help,

-Arvid Hokanson
