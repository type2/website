&gt; I did some searches on the AA p/c sets on Samba and Shoptalkforums_dot_com,
&gt; and while I didn't find anyone raving about them being *good*, I didn't
&gt; find
&gt; anyone ranting about them being *bad* either.  Still, people must be
&gt; buying
&gt; 'em .. or else they wouldn't still be on teh market.
