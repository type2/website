Tom,
I'm not sure about the stock carb for the '70 but on the 34 pict 3 that I use on
my 1600's there is a big brass idle circuit screw on the RIGHT side of the carb,
simply screw it out, check the small holes, three on the side, one on the tip,
for debris.  Blow, poke, spray it with carb cleaner to get it cleared and
reinstall, no adjustments on this screw but don't make it too tight.
I rehabbed a B*G that had sat for 5 yrs and even after changing all the filters
and gas it would send a small piece of crud into the carb occasionally and I'd
have to clear that screw.
let us know what you find.
