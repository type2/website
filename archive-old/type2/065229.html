Subject: Re: turn signal signals

&gt;Hi all - while we were discussing relays, lights and what not, I have a
&gt;question about my dashboard turn  indicator lights. They don't. USUALLY
&gt;this means one of my turnsignal BULBS is out, but all four work fine. And I
&gt;replaced both bulbs in the dash, checked all the wires, etc. I can hear the
&gt;relay clicking; usually the dashlights will light once or twice even if a
&gt;turn bulb is out, but not now.
&gt;I am also curious - if both indicator lights on a 70 flash in unison,
&gt;regardless of whether left or right is selected, are there years where the
&gt;dash indicators correspond ONLY to the direction you plan to go?

I think you have the original relay, which had a dedicated connector for
the dash indicators, and that part of it has failed. You can use a regular
domsetic car flasher, in fact the VW replacements used to be just
that.Haven't bought one from VW in a while, so I don't know uf this is
still the case. All the typ II's have only one indicator for left or right,
but I think you could modify this if you were so inclined....

hope this helps,
