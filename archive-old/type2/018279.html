&gt; I presume this is the connection to the round thingy on the carb - the choke
&gt; unit. You'll have problems if you don't fix it back on. I dont know how easy
&gt; it will be to solder, but I dont think it will cause any damage if you do as
&gt; its all metal and ceramic underneath. If you can get it to solder up, take
&gt; the unit off until you can replace it. i've run all winter with only one
&gt; choke OK. If it's left on it'll run rich and rough

I don't think this is the choke. There are two connections on the right hand
carb: one to a small cylinder towards the back of the carb (nearer driver), 
which is OK. The other is on the front face of the carb as you see it when you 
open the engine back door and is the broken one.
