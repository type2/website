The first question I would ask is, are there electrical signals reaching the
injectors to tell them to open.
 
Remove one of the injector's leads and attach a 12v lamp to that lead and
ground the other terminal of the light.  When cranking the engine the light
should flicker.  If not, then you have an electrical problem.  Possible
electrical problems:
  1. Bad distributor points - the computer control unit triggers fuel injection
     every other ignition pulse.
  2. Bad connectors/wires - check all connectors and wiring to make sure they
     are intact
  3. Bad control unit - have it tested if all else fails

If the light does flicker, then you have one or more of three problems:
  1. Low/no fuel pressure or flow - check fuel pressure and flow rate
  2. Faulty injectors - check resistance across injectors to see if they are in
     spec
  3. Clogged injectors - clean injectors

While you are at it, check to make sure that the cold start injector is
working.

: right but the injectors still aren't working. I get fuel all the way to them
: and then it's just stops.  I took one suggestion and and squirted some carb
