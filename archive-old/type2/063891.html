Craig, 
I called the local VW dealer today and got a rather helpful and knowlegable
young (sounding) lady parts person who looked up my van (she asked for the
serial number, said she had to have it to get the right distributor), and
informed me I could have an brand new Bosch in two days for *only* $475. Not too
bad considering it'll probably last another 15 years. Nonetheless, more than I'm
looking to spend. The catch? Well, the part number she gave me was 022 905 205
S, which I found out after I got off the phone is vacuum advance only. Now I'm
really confused. Bently says &quot;The 1971 and later models have both vacuum and
centrifugal advance mechanisms, with vacuum retard at idle.&quot;
At any rate, I'm going to hold out 'til I find out for sure which one is
correct, and then I'll be looking for the exact same part number.
Thanks just the same, Craig. I hate to pass up on a good deal, but I've got a
distributor I'm happy with, it's just not gonna get me past emissions.
