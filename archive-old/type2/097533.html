Subject: More power out of 2L FI

Hey guys,
Well I picked up the 79 westy with auto trans that I posted about last week.
I'm both happy and surprised by its performance, had been planning to build
a bigger motor but have since changed my mind as it works well as is. The
motor is coming out to be rebuilt though, since we found some suspitous
looking pieces of bearing in the sump last oil change. What I was wondering
though, was if there is anything you can do to get a little more power out
of the stock motor while still retaining the stock FI. I really don't want
to give it up, and is infact one of the reasons I bought the van, it runs so
well compared to the carb'd vws in the past I've driven. Will most likely go
with a soild lift cam, even though I do like how the hyd runs, as I am aware
of some of the maladies of the hydro setup. Will also stick to stock bore
and stroke, but what about a change to 1800 heads for a little bit more
flow? or does it mess with the FI too much? Or what about a mild cam change?
I'm just not sure how much the FI can put up with, or if its like a stock
single solex, already running at its max. thanks for any insight.
VWMIKE
