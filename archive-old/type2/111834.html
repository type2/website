Subject: Re: [T2] High Idle after removing EGR..WHY?

&gt; Yesterday I removed the EGR valve and successfully placed a block off

&gt; why this is?...And is there anything I can do about it? Plus, the idle
&gt; oscillates about 200 rpm between high and low.

You have a vacuum leak.  I don't know where but the leak is certain with
your symptoms. From your post I think that you are as certain of that as
I.  If you do not own a vacuum gauge you should buy one. There are some
jobs where that job cannot be accomplished without the proper tool and
this is one of them.  Buy the gauge!  Install it on the teat on the
manifold center section between cylinders 1 and 2.  It will read less than
15&quot; of vacuum at idle.

Once the gauge is installed you should can begin to inspect all your
vacuum lines.  Jiggle them about and see if the readings change.  Old
lines are often quite stiff and may still leak even after your cut the end
off.  The gasket you installed under the EGR may not be sealing. Did you
use a dab of gasket sealant on the faces of your blockoff plate? In any
event I am sure that you have a vacuum leak.

&gt; What are the problems of running idle at 1200 range?

There is no problem with the 1200 RPM idle.  There are major problems with
running an engine that has a vacuum leak.  You will overheat it and it
will fail for a start.

                             OOK!
