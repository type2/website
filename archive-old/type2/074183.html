Subject: Good news/GREAT news

The good news is that I gave notice at my job and I will soon, by
necessity, have more time (and energy!) to commit to junkyarding, which I
haven't done since Steve was out here last June.

The GREAT news is that WENDELIN'S HOME!!!! I picked her up this afternoon,
and since it cost much less to spring her than I'd expected, I took her to
the hand wash/dry carwash for the special treatment and new air freshener
(and a compass -- she's wanted one for a while). Now I have to give the
interior a thorough cleaning and get reacquainted with her (I keep thinking
she's stalled at lights, the new engine is so quiet).

This is SO exciting! I had to ask the mechanic about three times if it was
OK to leave. It's been so long I still can't believe that big red bus
parked across the street (in the no bird doody zone) is mine!
