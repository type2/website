Hey all,
EveryBus was a great time this year!  As Chris already mentioned, we had
about 120 Buses show up and gorgeous weather.  I think everyone was
impressed with the turnout and the good times.

I took Friday off work to join up with Jeff Stewart's caravan from northern
VA.  The Canadian contingent had arrived at Jeff's house Thursday evening
for the caravan.  I live near Steve Dolan so we had planned to both caravan
out from Alexandria to Jeff's place in Round Hill.  Well as often happens we
were both running a bit late as far as packing and getting on the road.  We
also couldn't find directions to Jeff's house, so we decided to meet up at
the first stopping point in Opal, VA on Route 29.  We drove out on
Interstate 66 to Gainesville and got on 29 south to the designated meeting
point, a Sheetz gas station in Opal.  I was in my '79 Westy and Steve was
driving his '67 Westy which was stripped down to the bare minimum as it was
to be delivered to Kelly Brown in NC for body work.  We got to the Sheetz
fairly early so we had time to get some breakfast and gas and do a little
tweaking on Steve's Bus.  As we were standing over by Steve's Bus I saw some
Buses start to roll in.

I will try to remember everyone in the caravan so forgive me if I leave
someone out, there were a few! :-)
There was of course Jeff in his '77 Westy with a small trailer, Jamie Rivers
and crew in his '74 Westy, Greg Potts in his '73(?) Westy, Greg's parents (I
don't think I caught their names) in an air-cooled Vanagon Westy, Dave
Ireland in his Westy (year unknown), Jamie Auch in an early bay Westy towing
a good-sized camping trailer, Colli (last name I didn't catch) in a nice
late bay Westy, Tom (again forgot last name) from PA in an early bay, and a
late orange Bus and I am blanking now on who was driving that one.  Had
Michigan plates tho :-)

Anyway most of the Buses were equipped with CBs so we all tuned to channel
14.  Having the CB turned out to be very helpful in coordinating the caravan
and advising of stops, which we would soon have plenty of :-)

Our route involved staying on Route 29 all the way down until we picked up
421 in Greensboro.  Route 29 is mostly nice 4-lane highway through very
scenic parts of Virginia but it is quite hilly.  We soon found that Jaime
Auch's 1600 had its work cut out for it pulling the camper trailer. I was
following Jamie and it's weird to have to hit the brakes going uphill :-)

We started noticing that the hills were killing Jeff's '77 even worse than
Jamie's 1600 so I radioed him and asked him what was up.  Seems his engine
was down on power for some reason so at our next pit stop we had a look.
Apparently it was missing under load so he was having a hard time getting up
the hills.  We suspected either ignition or fuel, and given that ignition is
easier Steve brought out his dwell-tach and checked the dwell, which was
something like 66 deg.  Steve readjusted the point gap and dwell was down to
about 45 degrees, much closer to the 50 degree spec.  We got back underway
and Jeff reported that it was running much better with more power.  We
thought we had it solved...

In Charlottesville we stopped at Wal-Mart and most folks went shopping and
picked up some camping supplies and got a needed stretch/bathroom break.
Back on the road...  Apparently Wal-Mart security got all excited when they
spotted the Buses in the parking lot on the security cameras.  I guess they
thought we were going to camp but Jamie let them know we were just shopping.

By the time we got to Lynchburg it was about time to get gas.  Someone had
radioed that they knew of a cheap gas station up ahead so we were all
holding off.  Well that turned out to be a mistake :-)
Jamie Auch and Tom were at the back of the caravan.  Jamie had been
reporting recently over the radio that he was down on power a bit and sure
enough, as the 29 Bypass came back to rejoin 29, Jamie's Bus rain out of gas
right on the on-ramp.  All of the caravan was far ahead of Jamie and Tom who
also stopped there.  We got news on the radio that Jamie was out of gas so
we pulled off into a Wal-Mart and Sam's Club about a half-mile up the road.
I went back to the on-ramp to see what the deal was.  I then rode a little
past them to a Wilco gas station that was right there but due to the highway
design you couldn't push their Bus back to the gas station.  Anyway, the gas
station DIDN'T SELL GAS CANS.  So I went back to the breakdown location to
inform the guys what was up.  They had moved, Tom had actually hooked up a
tow rope to Jamie's Bus AND CAMPER and towed them up the road about 1/4 mile
to a side street where they could pull off out of the main traffic flow.  I
let them know that the gas station didn't have gas cans but I knew where
there was a Wal-Mart :-)
Jamie gave me some cash so I drove back to Wal-Mart, bought a gas can, drove
back to the Wilco, filled it with gas, then drove it back to Jamie's
location and got him going again.

Then of course we all stopped at the next gas station and filled up :-)

While all this gas can buying was going on, Steve was readjusting Jeff's
points to get closer to 50 degrees dwell.  Well unfortunately at least from
a psychological standpoint that was not the thing to do as it was now
running badly again.  So at the gas station Steve tweaked 'em again and we
also had a look at Jamie Auch's timing which was spot-on for a stock
distributor but probably not so great with the 009 he was running.  As he
didn't have a degree wheel pulley, we had no real way to properly set the
timing for max advance, so we decided to leave it.

As soon as we pulled out of that Amoco parking lot we pulled into the gas
station parking lot next door because Jeff's bus was still running really
bad.  While in this parking lot, Tom was turning his bus around when POP a
vital piece of steering gear disengaged itself from the front axle beam.
Just so happened that there was a tow truck driver in the lot who happened
to be talking with the other Bus folks and Tom was able to get a tow from
this guy.  Tom of course had to disengage himself from the caravan for a
while but he got towed to a shop where he was able to weld the steering gear
back up and he got back on the road, getting to EveryBus not long after the
rest of us, due to the number of stops to come.

After some more readjusting of the points in Jeff's Bus we got back on the
road but he was still having trouble.  Just up the road we turned into the
Lynchburg Airport for further analysis.  We were starting to lean more
towards a fuel delivery problem now since our ignition fumbling didn't seem
to be doing anything.  We tweaked a little more, made sure vacuum hoses were
tight, etc.  On the road again.

As we got out of Lynchburg and started speeding up, it was still not well.
We pulled into a self-storage parking lot to try to figure out our options
and what to do about it.  We tried a few things, Jeff changed fuel filters,
but that didn't help.  Test driving it on the side road that went by the
parking lot, when he would put it under load at high rpm it would just buck
and it sounded like the engine was cutting out entirely.  We checked timing,
dwell, checked dwell while driving to see if it was changing and it wasn't.
Rechecked vacuum hoses, FI connections.  Threw in a spare AFM that Jeff had,
still no luck.  By this time the property owner had showed up and was
anxious to have us gone.  He didn't want any attention attracted to the
property and didn't want us taking pictures, which I thought was a bit odd.
So we finished up what we were doing and hit the road.

Still no solution to Jeff's problem so we pulled over once more and finally
decided to hell with it, let's just go. So we did.  Jeff was reporting that
he had good power but it was still missing and bucking under load.  At this
point we were all ready to press on and just live with it.

After Lynchburg a few of the Canadians radioed that they had to make a pit
stop due to children's bathroom needs but they advised us to keep going and
they'd catch up.  So 3 of the Buses pulled off and the rest kept going.

We stayed on the road the rest of the way.  When we got past Danville Jamie
Auch radioed that he wanted to pull over and tweak his accelerator cable.
He told us to keep on going so we did.  When he pulled over Steve Dolan did
too because his radio wasn't working too well and he missed the part about
us going on.

So we finally arrived around 9:30 PM on Friday night.  As we were pulling
into the campground I was on the CB when I heard Jamie Rivers' voice.  They
must have made great time in catching up because the 3 Buses that pulled off
way back at Lynchburg pulled in a few minutes after us.  Then not too long
after that Jamie Auch, Steve Dolan and Tom from PA all arrived at about the
same time.

We all got spots around the back side of the pavilion.  Not the quietest
spot but one of the few left where we could plug into the electrical
hookups.

The number of Buses was amazing.  All the perimeter spots were filled and
the infield was basically filled with our arrival.  There were Buses parked
on the other side of the campground too, the other infield.  Buses continued
to arrive throughout the night.  I made the rounds seeing who was there,
lots of familiar faces and lots of new faces too.

I think I went to bed by about 12:30 as I was really tired from our 7 hour
drive that turned into 13 hours :-)

Saturday was great, beautiful weather and the offical count was made of
around 120 Buses.  Picked up my EveryBus 2001 t-shirt from Richard Palmer,
what a great looking shirt :-) .  Spent a lot of time chatting with other
Bus folks and just relaxing.  Chris did a great job coordinating the kids'
events during the day.  In the evening we had the chili cookoff.  Lots of
folks made lots of varieties of chili.  The judges got first crack at the
chili and then it was a free-for-all for everyone else.  I think I had 4
bowls of chili which was far too much but not as much as I wanted because I
didn't get to try all of them.  The Super-Hot award goes to Matt Freeman's
John Muir Memorial 40 HP Chili which was amazingly spicy and caused me to
consume too many beers too rapidly :-)

Speaking of beer, John Yust brewed up a nice american pale ale this year
which I made sure to have before the crowd drank all of it, which happened
quickly.  John Steincamp(?sp) also brewed up EveryBeer, a very nice stout
which I was also sure to sample :-)

After dinner came the awards ceremony, and as well all sat around and in the
pavilion by the fireplace, one could not help thinking of the campfire scene
in Blazing Saddles.

As usual the awards were great and all the kids got something.  I was
fortunate enough to get a copy of Small Wonder as my door prize which I was
very happy about since I don't own that book and haven't read it.  There
were lots of door prizes and then the people's choice award.  Nicest Bus
went to the owner (sorry, forgot the name) of a beautiful splittie but of
course I forgot what the prize was.  Had a bit of beer by that point.  The
&quot;I can't believe he drove that here&quot; award went to Tom from PA as by now his
front axle beam welding story was well-known.  The award was a trophy made
up by Kelly Brown fabricated from a nice rusty Bus jack point :-)
The Longest Trip award went to Dave Schwarze who came from Texas.  He got a
nice cooler to keep the beer cold on those long trips.

Apparently there was a case burning after the awards but I seem to have
missed that somehow :-)

After the awards someone was replacing the points and condenser in Jeff's
Bus with new points Jeff had and a spare condenser Dave Ireland had.  I
didn't catch this guy's name unfortunately.  Put the points and condenser in
and timed it properly and he said he'd be back the next morning to check out
the valves.

Towards the tail end of this process I was hearing music coming from the
pavilion.  Stuck my head around and there is an actual band playing!  When
did this happen? :-)
I went in to listen.  Their style was that good old time country type
music -- if you've seen &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; you know what I'm
talking about.  Man they were good.  Had upright bass, a couple mandolins,
harmonica, a couple lap steels and as many as 4 guitars.  Everybody was
constantly trading off instruments so who was playing what and how many were
always changing.  They played for a good while and drew an appreciative
crowd as their set went on.  They finished up at around 11 I think, and one
of the gentlemen stayed and played a couple more songs on guitar.

After that I was ready to bring out my guitar so me and a guy I have played
with before brought out our guitars to the pavilion.  Guy, I'm sorry, I just
don't know your name.  Send me an e-mail if you read this.  Anyway we played
for a while, jamming on some Neil Young and Bob Dylan tunes until about 2 in
the morning when I decided I needed to go to bed.

Had a wicked headache when I woke up Sunday morning.  Spent some time
packing up camp.  I wasn't going to Farmington so I was in no real hurry to
get out of Dodge.  The gentleman who was working on Jeff's Bus came over and
did a valve adjustment -- he found lots of very tight valves and a couple
very loose valves.  The engine sounded much better after the valve
adjustment.  Jeff took a test drive around the campground and the problem
did not seem to exist anymore.  I suspect that fixed the problem but if not
I told him next thing I would do would be to try a different coil.

Jeff, let us know how that worked out for your trip home.

Steve and I set off after packing up to find Kelly's shop and drop off the
'67.  As we were leaving the campground Kelly was pulling up in his Thing so
he turned around and led the way through some nice NC back roads to his shop
where we dropped off the '67 and got a quick tour of the shop and the
current projects.

Then we got on the road and had a relatively uneventful trip.  We spotted
that air-cooled Vanagon in Danville which I posted about yesterday.  We had
a good ride back, made good time but we both felt a little grungy after the
trip as it was kinda warm yesterday.  Had a few episodes of testing the
Bus's emergency avoidance maneuver capability which I'm happy to say the Bus
does pretty well at, so we all came through unscathed.

A great event backed up by great folks behind the scenes.  Kudos to Chris
and to all those he already thanked in his e-mail as this is undoubtedly one
of the best events out there.  I will attempt to have my pics up as soon as
possible, and I'll post when they are up.

Thanks for reading this long thing :-)
