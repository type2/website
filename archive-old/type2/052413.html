Subject: [T2] BN2 installation

Hi Everybody,
   I've spent all winter getting a BN2 gas heater ,that I bought, fixed up 
and running right.  Now I'm starting to think about installation into our 
&quot;71 westy.  Of course my first idea was to put it in the left side of the 
engine bay, but I'd like to reserve that space for a second battery.  Now 
I'm thinking of putting it under the bus in some sort of protective metal 
box.  I'd then take intake air from inside our westy and duct the heat into 
the normal heater tube. This would provide recirculation of the warm air 
from in the bus.  Of course exhaust from the heater would go overboard.
   I'd like to hear your opinions of my under bus scheme, and of any other 
locations and ideas that you think would be good.  Thanks for the input!
