Subject: Re: [T2] Stock FI to progressive carb, any thoughts or
  comments?

Hello????     Gregory??     Most of us like the FI even thu it can be harder 
to deal with and some of the parts are costly .  Have you thought about having 
a professional look at it ?  I dont know where you are located but check the 
AIRS list for somebody near you  . Also there are listings for shops on the 
Samba  later  and have fun  Mark Dearing
