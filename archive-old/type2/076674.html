Subject: Re: [T2] VOA strikes again



&gt; Well Volkwagen of Amercia hit me with a cease and desist  legal warning
this morning. ...

&gt;Hopefully for awhile that will satisfy their need to harass people trying
to keep alive the very vehicles that they show virtually no support for.

Hi Kelly, you know, I think Volkswagen is just wasting their time chasing
all the small-time users of their name.  The truth is that the Volkswagen
name is out of date, what with its 1930's lumpenproletariat overtones.  VW
would do much better just to let everyone use their present trademarks and
pick a new name, more in touch with their present corporate identity, and
which no one else would want to use.

How about, say, Philip Morris?  Its present owner doesn't want the name
anymore, it has built-in brand recognition, and nobody else will want to use
it.  And best of all, it fits their new corporate style.

Regards,

Grant
