Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Interior Panel Patterns

Here is what I have done in the past when encountering similar situations:

Get some sacrificial screws that fit the holes in the bus.  Cut the heads
off of the screws and file the shaft of each headless screw to a point.
Thread the pointed, headless screws partway into the holes in the bus.  Hold
the panel in place over the screws.  Press on the panel over each screw
location.  The pointed, headless screws will make indentations in the back
side of the panel in the proper locations.  Drill holes in the panel through
each indentation, and you should be good to go.

It might be wise to do one screw hole at a time, or at least do one, drill
the hole, fasten the panel in place with a screw in that location to confirm
proper fit, and then, with the panel still held in place by the one screw,
make the marks at the other locations.


&quot;.....The panels are screwed to the side of the bus (not the door panels, of
=
course.)  The holes must be drilled in precisely the correct location.  =
Not such a big deal with the smaller pieces, but with the larger one =
behind the driver you can't see to line up the holes.  My holes were =
drilled correctly and I still had a little trouble.  So when making the =
pattern, take careful measurements for those screws.
Then again, you could just try drilling NEW holes into the metal walls.  =
Not something I would want to do though.....&quot;
