Subject: Re: [T2] This list

Mark(and others),

Thanks!...it's a great list!

I think the key is &quot;moderated&quot;...and the rules.

I am on a particular Subaru list and it is pretty good.  Just like here, 
every one sort moderates themselves fairly well, and the moderators work 
well to keep the topic &quot;on topic&quot;.

Yep, some &quot;younger&quot; posters who get their knuckles whacked every once in 
awhile, but otherwise fine.

Lots of folks as knowledgeable as on this list, but dealing with new 
cars....we hear that the &quot;suits&quot; as Subaru actually read the stuff on that 
list....not that it seems to help much, nice to know that *someone* is 
listening(maybe).

You should hear them talk about watercooled vw owners tho!...and VWOA
Their opinion(those that have had VW's) about VWOA is even worse than our 
opinion!...imagine that!

Lots of &quot;mod&quot; talk and performance talk...and best of all

Who is having warranty complaints and about what....Of course *we* don't 
have to worry about that stuff!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I just had an &quot;experience&quot; with another automotive interest list. I 
&gt; won't say what kind of car, but it wasn't German and it wasn't air 
&gt; cooled.
&gt; 
 It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat 
 everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational, 
 supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and 
 most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for 
 generally being pretty good eggs.
