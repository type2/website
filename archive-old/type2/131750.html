Subject: HELP! Clark Griswald Strikes Again!

OKay every thing is hooked up out back. Had the family out to watch the 
first turn of the key. My turned the key.....NOTHING!. Okay since the 
excitement is turning into frustration, I breathe. I check the power at the 
battery. 13.86vlt. I connected my remote starter to the starter turns over 
fine. I go back to the key. No power up front. No lights radio, which is not 
connected to the key switch just a live wire to the fuse block.

All this being said I did, during this engine cleanup, remove the A/C unit 
from under the dash. I go back to look at the mess of wires from the dealer 
install and PO elctrical wizard. I have found a hefty black wire about a 
foot long not connected I don't remember if this was pulled from the A/C 
unit. It goes behind the fuse block an connects to the 3rd or 4th terminal 
from the right. Where does this go?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am not to the point of 
throwing in the towel and offering my bus to the first $500, but I would 
like to figure this out.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
