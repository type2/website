Subject: Re: [T2] New shocks need for 74 westy, any suggestions

&gt;I need new front shocks and will probably replace
&gt;all four shocks next weekend.  Just wanted to
&gt;hear from folks regarding your experiences with
&gt;new shocks.  My options appear to be monroe gas
&gt;thingies for cheap like $10 each, gabriel gas for
&gt;a little more, and KYB's, either gas-adjust or
&gt;gr2, for about $30 each.  Any body tried one or
&gt;more of these?

Nemo, the stock shocks were Boge. Note my 72 still has the originals in 
proper functional order. You will not get that kind of durability, much 
less the custom matched functional criteria, from the aftermarket stuff 
designed to be cheap in comparison and general in specification. Poorer 
function and shorter life are not the road to reduced cost per mile, over 
the long haul.

If you want, I'll check on availability and cost for the real deal Boges. 
Even good condition original Boges from the junk yard would be better than 
new junk. Find a chassis you can bounce test and pull some good ones.
