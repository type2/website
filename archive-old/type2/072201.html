&gt;Hey Y'all,
&gt;  I am selling my 1970 Bus with a westy pop-top and Z-bed.

I wish people would realize that this internet travels all over the world.
If you don't tell us where you are, how are we going to know if we should
be interested or not?

On your tag line, let us know where you are please.
