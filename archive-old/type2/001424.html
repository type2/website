Subject: Re: [T2] changing out front end

First off, $275.00 sounds a bit (quite a bit) high for an axle beam. I =
just replaced the one on my '77 earlier this year, and it took me =
several weekends to do the job, but then my Westy isn't a daily driver =
so I wasn't in any hurry. It is a fairly tough job, but anyone with =
average mechanical skills can do it. A second person (even a 3rd) to =
help is nice, although I did mine by myself. Click on the link below to =
my page, then on the link at the bottom to read my short write up on =
axle beam replacement. Also look in the type2 library for axle beam =
info(good stuff). Jeff
