&gt; Hey Yall
&gt; I'm replacing a fuel pump in my 1600DP (1971 westy). There is a minor 
&gt; fuel leak coming out of the bottom and I'm hittin the road soon. The 
&gt; procedure from Bently and Muir look pretty simple - questions though:
&gt;
&gt; 1.I have moly grease and disc brake grease in my collection - will 
&gt; either of these do or should I get something else, specifically what - 
&gt; to pack in the pump when I put it in?

not sure.

&gt; 2.Do I have to mess with the bottom half - that part that goes into the 
&gt; case - since I'm not replacing that part? If so, do I have to do the 
&gt; manual engine crank to get the thing at its highest stroke? (sorry for 
&gt; the lack of terminology - I'm not near my bus or manuals right now.)

I carry a spare push rod or two with me because I've had that go on me 
before and figure it's just as
likely to go as the fuel pump.  When you're replacing the pump, compare 
the old rod to the new one
and make sure they're roughly the same length and it should be fine.

&gt; 3. Are the two paper gaskets that came with my Brazilian pump 
&gt; sufficient? I seem to remember something about more shims and I don't 
&gt; think any came with it. When I get back to town, I leave the next day 
&gt; on my road trip and may have to replace the pump on the road, so want 
&gt; to make sure I have all I need.
&gt;

i've never heard anything about any shims for the 71, although the fuel 
pumps are different depending
on if you have an alternator or generator and I have only replaced the 
alternator type fuel pump.
The generator type may be different, but all that was required for the 
alt. type was the 2 paper
gaskets that came with the new pump.
