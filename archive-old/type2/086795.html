&gt; Some may find this battery to be of interest as to style, price, design, etc.

the Yuasa &quot;Starved electrolyte&quot; battery is far better, but more expensive.
these are deep cycle batteries

a gel cell has about 1/3 less power as a lead acid battery of the same
size.  

they are certified for transport on aircraft

I have used the starved electrolyte batteries from Yuasa for years in
other (non bus) applications and they are excellent batteries.

however I still run twin Exide lead acid batteries in my bus


YMMV
Bob
&gt; 
&gt; Won't leak.
&gt; At least that is a plus.
&gt; Has handles for lugging around and moving.
&gt; Has screw terminals for hooking up the wires of the item(s) you might 
&gt; desire to power.
&gt; 
&gt; It should charge just like a normal battery off of our VW charging systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I did not compare the physical size to normal lead-acid design automotive 
&gt; battery group sizings, so you may want to look at the dimensions a bit just 
&gt; to see if it fits in your bus where you want it to fit.
&gt; 
&gt; All rest as to pro-con evaluation is up to the buyer.
