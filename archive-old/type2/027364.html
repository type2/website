sorry, i live in minneapolis. I hope i can find someone who needs a six pack 
around here...that i can afford.  thanks for the offer, though!  side note.  
I think I am looking for a 76 to a 79...something about the govener being 
better than the vaccum.

&gt;Are you looking for an auto tranny? Where are you located? If it's anywhere
&gt;near SC, you can come and get one from my '74 Donor for next to nothing 
&gt;(like
&gt;a 6 pack and we can pull it together). I have to get this bus outta my yard
&gt;soon so I can make room for another one.
