Hey Volks,

I was wondering how hard a job it is to heli coil the sump drain plug?? Is 
this something i can do myself or does the shop have to do it?? Does the 
engine need to come out and the sump removed?? I'm talking about a 1.8L type 
4. I must have striped it last time I took it out to change the oil....I'm 
kicking myself in the ass right now. I put teflon plumbers tape on it right 
now as a temporary mesure but would like to fix this in the near future. I 
also am having a problem getting a leak from the Oil filler pipe to stop. I 
took the pipe off when I dropped my engine and have had problems ever since. 
I can't get the nuts to screw onto the studs without stripping the threads 
in the nuts when I tighten it down. I have tried about 5 times with 
different nuts and they all have stripped. Any ideas??

Thanks
