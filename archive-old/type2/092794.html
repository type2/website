Subject: RE: [T2] Installing cruise on 81 aircooled Vanagon

No - Gene Berg still sells these.

Glenn-Ring has one. Nice, nice, nice tranny.

I've got the shifter as back in 1995 I had more money than responsibilities 
when I was still in the Navy. Then my enlistment was up and I came back to 
the real world and had bills (not much to spend your money on while you are 
at sea).

One of these days I still hope to pursue a 5 speed from berg or a Porsche 
901 for my Beetle. Want 5 close ratio gears with stock high gear retained 
and a 3.88 R/P for my Type IV powered Beetle.

&gt;         You could have them!  Really!  Gene Berg used to sell a kit for a 
&gt; five speed that replaced the OEM gear carrier with an aftermarket 
&gt; one.  It had 5 forward speed gears that used your stock fourth as the 
&gt; fifth gear.  $1K was a bit pricey though, and I think they discontinued 
&gt; production based upon lackluster sales.
