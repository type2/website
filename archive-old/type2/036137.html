Subject: &lt;F&gt;BBQ, 2/19, San Pedro

Just a reminder:

FEBRUARY 19 (a week from tomorrow): H. Steve Dolan, Visiting Dignitary
BBQ. Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro at 1:00 p.m. There is a nominal parking
fee, but plenty of parking, a picnic area, a really neat little marine
museum that kids just love, a playground, and of course, the beach.
BYO-whatever. Die-hard partiers can come over to my place when it gets
dark or we get kicked off the beach (whichever comes first), and there's
room for 6-8 campers in the alley behind my house.
