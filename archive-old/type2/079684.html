Subject: RE: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

I bought a rebuilt from a company not to be named and after 3 burned pistons
in less than 30,000 miles (and months in the shop), I finally replaced it
with a Canadian VW rebuilt that was expensive but... it has 70k miles and
the compression tests consistently read 125-130 in all 4 cylinders.

And the VW rebuilt had hydraulic lifters which the previous engine from hell
did not.

&gt; have never heard of anyone actually buying one, but I am considering it.

I tried buying one about 2-3 years ago and was told, temporarly not
avaliable
