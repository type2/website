&gt;&gt;  Test the tops and bottoms of the fuses, if you have power on one end but
not the other, the fuse is bad.
Sometimes these fuses are just not making contact; give them a twirl to make
them seat better.  &lt;&lt;
-------------------------------------------------

While you're checking for &quot;hot&quot; and continuity at the fuses, also check the
fuseholder clip at each end of each fuse.

It's possible to have current at both ends of a fuse [testing by touching
the fuse cap or terminal], but no current at the clip &quot;downstream&quot; of the
fuse.

Also check for continuity by testing current at the metal terminals of wires
&quot;downstream&quot; of the fuses, where they connect to the fuse block.

Any place where electrical continuity depends on 2 separate pieces of metal
touching each other [push-on wire terminals and junctions, screw terminals,
etc.] has the potential to block the electrical current.  Connections can
look OK on the outside and still be unable to pass current because of
internal dirt and corrosion.

Remember this is Direct Current [DC].  The power only flows in one
direction, from positive [+] to negative [-].  A VW bus has negative ground,
so current flows TO any metal attached to the bus structure.

FWIW.....
