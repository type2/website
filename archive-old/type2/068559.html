Subject: 8 volt battery in 6 volt bus?

We have a '62 bus which is still 6 volt.  Among the 
other various somewhat strange things the previous owner 
did to the bus, he put an 8 volt Interstate Fleet Commercial 
battery into it.

We are now in a position where we'd like to 1) buy a battery
charger and 2) buy another battery.

Does anyone know if using an 8 volt battery is actually
a good idea (the previous owner seemed to think it was), or
should we go ahead and get a 6 volt instead?

Regardless, can the 8 volt battery be charged up with a charger 
that is suppposed to be used with either 6 or 12 volt batteries 
(presumably on the 6 volt setting)?  I'm guessing maybe so, as
the 8 volt battery was apparently being charged OK by the 6 volt
generator (or not, and this is why we need a charge/new battery).

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Brian and Stephanie
