There is a size difference in the rear windows of Baywindow 
pick ups, upto and including '74 and then '75 and later. The later 
window, which has been the correct replacement for the earlier cars 
for years, can be fitted to '74 and earlier cars with seal 211 845 521 D, 
(according to the VW parts literature) this is the '75 and later Bus rear 
hatch window seal. I have tried this combination and couldn't get the 
window in. I have one used '75 and up pick up rear window. I am 
located in The Netherlands though.
