Subject: Valve adjusting screws

esteemed list:

Does anyone know where to get properly hardened valve adjusting screws (for
a Type 1)?  A few of the ones I got at the online vendor with the &quot;lifetime
warrantee&quot;  snapped in half over the last year, and the rest are badly
mushroomed.  This is after only 6000 miles of driving.  Valve adjustments
every 1500 miles, for what it was worth with this kind of crap.

Anyone have a stash of N.O.S.?
