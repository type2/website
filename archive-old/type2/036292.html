Subject: '77 Bus FS LA Area

I hate to do it, but I have to get rid of my '77 Bus.  
I can't afford the time that I need to get it into
better shape.  Mechanically it is pretty sound.  
Cosmetically it needs quite a bit of TLC.
It also needs a bit of electrical work.
I've thrown some money into it and I'd like
to get around $1000 for it, but I'm pretty willing
to negotiate.  I'm in a position where I need to make
it happen pretty soon.  If you want any further
info, please let me know.  

Thanks a ton.
