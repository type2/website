Subject: happy story and question
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, Rettung moved out of the garage last night on his own power...new 
accelerator pedal and all.  the pedal modification wasn't too bad since we 
had the old one to go by.

heat has also been restored to the vehicle...and the bus is minus (what i 
hope to be the last) the mother of all mice nests.  yes, that's right, it 
was in the long tube under the bus.  we used the shopvac to vacuum and blow 
and finally figured out where the air was stopped.  anyway, all clear 
now.  at a decent rpm, we have heat.  we also rigged the fan to come on 
always...that helped.

so, here's the question:

while searching for the cause of the air loss, we found a large machined 
slot/hole near the heat exchanger.  it is rectangular in shape and cannot 
be seen from the underside of the bus (towards engine compartment.)  on the 
driver's side, there is a bracket that mounts on top of the hole with two 
bolts to a flange.  from what i recall, the connection is from the engine 
to the heat exchanger?  anyway, the PO had duct tape wrapped around the hole.

what is this bracket?  can i order another one?  i'm losing a ton of 
heat/air back there and i'm sure the engine isn't being cooled correctly 
either.

thanks everyone
