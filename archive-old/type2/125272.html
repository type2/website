Subject: Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

Will this stand work for a type 4 motor????
http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=32915

I've been thinking of building my own, using a tranny bell housing so
I can &quot;bench start&quot; the motor, but just the metal to build a &quot;sturdy&quot;
Frame would probably cost me more than the $39.99 for the stand above..

Will this work??? All responses welcome...

All the &quot;VW Engine&quot; stands I've found all say &quot;Not for Type 4 motors&quot;
So what's a driver to do?????

TIA
