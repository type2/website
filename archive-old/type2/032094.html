&gt; Jake at aircooled has said much the same thing.  But I am certain that
&gt; the oil is coming from the joint of the plastic oil fill tube and the
&gt; metal elbow.  Oil is coming up right at the joint, and being sucked into
&gt; the fan and off it goes!!

This is an easy fix. Sometimes the plastic tube fits pretty tightly over
the rounded, flanged end of the metal elbow it connects to. You might tap
the thing on with a rubber mallet to be sure it's popping &quot;over the hump&quot;
and is really engaged. Similarly be sure that the wire circle spring that
holds it on is tight. You could certainly add a bead of soft gasket
sealant around the inside of the plastic tube before you push it on to
make it seal even better. If this is your only problem, you are going to
get off cheaply.

&gt;   There is no oil coming from the dipstick.
&gt; There may be some oil weeping out from the valve covers, but it is very
&gt; minute.

This is the good news. Maybe your rings are actually OK.

&gt; Question though.  If the bus has fewer than 75,000 mi, would the rings
&gt; be worn?  That is the miles on my 82.

Sure. You could have a catastrophic failure of a ring at almost any point
in the life of an engine. As someone else pointed out, it can happen in a
few minutes if a ring sticks for some reason, gets hot and melts.

&gt; All in all, I am seriously thinking about a complete engine rebuild.  I
&gt; can't see anyway out of it.

First do a compression test and a leakdown test to assess the need for
this. On my engine, I had good compression even with a stuck ring, but a
leakdown test revealed it clearly. When we stripped down the engine and
looked I thought, &quot;Wow. How in the world did this cylinder have 120psi
compression? The rings look wasted!&quot;

Your actual mileage may vary,
