Subject: '73 - '79 Parts

 Having recently switched from a '73 pop-top to a '71 hard top (not a
pop-top), I have some '73 parts that I need to get rid of.  The list is as
follows:
  2   73 - 75 automatic transmissions (one with 200 miles on a $600 rebuild
job)   1   73 - 79 windshield wiper motor with linkage
  2   front brake calipers (1 for left side, 1 for right side)
  1   73 - 79 steering gear box
  1   73 - 79 steering column w/ignition switch
  1   73 - 79  windshield wiper/washer switch asm.
  1   73 - 79  turn signal/dimmer switch asm.
  1   jack w/lug wrench and vinyl case
  1   007 distributor from a '72 bus (I think)
  2   73 - 79 front turn signal lens (or is it lenses)
  3   73 - 79 tail light lenses (1 w/no cracks, 2 w/small cracks around
screw               that goes thru the back-up light portion of the lens)
  1   72 - 79 Haynes manual (would like to trade for a xx - 71 Haynes manual.
  1   73 - 79 Front bumper with a few dings and bangs
All free to a good home, except the rebuilt automatic transmission.  I got
it from a parts bus and promised the guy if I ever sold it I would send him
the money (and he really needs the money) so I would like to get some amount
of cash for it.  Every thing else is 'you figure out how to get it'.  Really
appreciate all the help and advice I get from 'The List'.
