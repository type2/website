Subject: FYI: &quot;Buses by the Depot&quot;, campout in PA, next to the Ron's
  Busdepot

FYI: Chris Turner (JordanVW, as known on the vanagon list) is 
&quot;organizing&quot; a campout. The following is the info:

Subject: its official &quot;BUSES by the DEPOT&quot; vw van get-together sat Oct 14th
          Green Lane PA

well it's &quot;official&quot;....this event will be called &quot;Buses by the Depot&quot; not
only because of its close proximity to Busdepot_dot_com, (Ron approved the event
name) but there is alot of old railroad history in that area.. ive traveled
backroads around there, and there are many old railroad sidings and railroad
depots, and you can see alot of places where old early 1900's railroad tracks
running across the road have been filled in, when the railroads 
became more obsolete
as commercial trucking and personal automobiles became more popular..

anyway, im hoping the turnout will be good.  i personally am only on the
vanagon lists now - since i got rid of all my baywindows i havent been on the
type2 lists lately..    what do you all think about opening this up 
to ALL vw vans
- from old splitties to baywindows, to new eurovans...not just vanagons?  let
me know how you all feel about that.   this way it could even gain
recognition as a LiMBO sanctioned event if we turn this into a yearly thing..

also, its been suggested that in order for us  (or should i say you all,
since i wont be camping :&lt;)  to get campsites right next to eachother - then it
might make sense to collect pre-paid reservations for adjoining spots (camping
is $15 per nite) - so that way you arent sandwiched between &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; and his
double wide '78 'Bago ratbox playing 'Skynrd all night long and swilling
moonshine..or something like that.. LOL   anyway, its up to y'all. 
this time of
year im sure the campground will hardly be packed though.. most likely be
empty..   but if someone wants to setup a paypal account (my paypal 
is currently
FUBAR)  and take reservations, then ron said he would stop by the park and
reserve a bunch of adjoining spots once paid reservations are confirmed.. (he
lives right by the park, i live 20-30 mins away from it)
so anyway, the reservation thing would be up to you all..

here is a tally of prospective attendees as of 7am EST tues:

so far  11 people plan to attend...  we need more!  people will be coming
from all over.. PA, MD, DE, NJ, VA..etc... make it a weekend trip!
