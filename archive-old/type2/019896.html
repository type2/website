Any ideas how to get that like new white back to a westy pop top without

&gt; painting. I've heard     X-14 works, but can't find it anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; Also, still looking for a 76-78 westy interior sink cabinet (prefer with
&gt; burner), any ideas??

x-14 is just bleach and water. tilex is also bleach and water any of these
products  will work. but it will not look like new unless you re-gel coat it,
which is difficult. you can also use marine paint like mar hyde which gives
very good results. but you have to get all the mildew off before painting
otherwise it'll just come back mildew is like rust in this respect.  if you
are in the mass or nh i can tell you of a junkyard with a 76 deluxe westy
that you can get the sink and stove from. i can get it for you as i don't
have the time though. sorry
jamie
