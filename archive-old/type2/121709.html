If there is enough stud available then vice grips and torch and some
penetrant will work just fine. Like with Mark, I heat up the stud and
surrounding metal and let it cool some and spray it down with penetrant.
As it completely cools it draws the penetrant around the threads. I then
use a small tip and heat up the metal around the stud and then vice grip
the stud and work it and heat it until it comes loose. Run a tap into
the threads to clean them out and then replace the stud with some
locktite.

Hello John   Well you have learned a leason   It is far better to cut
the nut
than break a stud. I use a real sharp chisel and cut the nut  in half
hitting
it on the face of the nut when possible. Now that it is broke try heat
and
vise grips, Worse then try the backwards drill bits being sure to grind
the
remain part of the stub flat and use a center punch to get the bit
started in the
center, use small bit first then increase the size of the drill bit.  I
use
Timeserts(tm)  to repair these broken studs. The main thing is to take
your time
and get the hole drilled correctly  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
