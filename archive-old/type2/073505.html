As I was falling asleep last night I remembered reading on this list about
aftermarket stabilizer bars.

I need to know:
   Who
   What
   Where
   Why

TIA for the contribution to my education.

&gt;Jerry,
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't drive without the stabilizer hooked up. Not
&gt;a good idea. Since you've got the thing off, you may
&gt;want to consider putting an aftermarket one on there,
&gt;they are heavy duty and will make your bus handle a
&gt;lot better than ever before.
