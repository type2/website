&gt; Why does everyone want a 78? I am always reading on the list that a 78 is 
&gt; the best year engine wise. Why is this? I would think a 79 would be better 
&gt; because it is newer and has the available exhaust pieces.

79 is essentially identical but has a one off head and exhaust manifold
making it harder to get some parts
