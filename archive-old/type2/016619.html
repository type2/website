&gt; When I bought my '76 Westy two years ago, the first

&gt; must have a bearing thats toast. I've driven almost
&gt; 4k miles since then,engine appears to be doing OK,
&gt; no knocking although it burns quite a bit of oil.
&gt; In the spring of '99 I'm going to pull this engine
&gt; and replace it with another one I have ( assuming
&gt; it lasts until spring). BTW, this engine is a GEX
&gt; rebuilt,( the letters GEX are stamped in the case)
&gt; which now has 74.5K on it, if PO is to be believed.
&gt;  If its still running when I pull it, I may offer to
&gt; sell it back to them, as this has to be a record for
&gt; one of their engines, as 3-5K seems to be the norm.

Jeff:
So then you're theorizing that the metal chunks must be some secret
ingredient that GEX used to make the motor last longer? :-)
Aluminum bits in oil are certainly cause for concern, they could be main
bearings or case. Steel could be end play shims, piston pin circlips, or
distributor drive gear or its thrust washer. Any of these are quite
serious enough if they are just now disintegrating. If they are left
over debris from a previous rebuild, then it's not such a concern unless
they were inside the oil cooler or oil passages. If you did the rebuild
yourself you'd have a pretty good idea of whether that is the case. If
this is a type 4 or a type 1 with an oil filter, then it's probably
prudent just to change the oil and filter and monitor the engine
condition. Check end play, compression check, valve clearance, listen
for new noises. I guess the same goes for the engine without oil filter,
but you can be sure that some of that metal is embedded in your bearings
by now and even if it's aluminum that's not a good thing. I'd be
planning for a replacement engine very soon in that case.
