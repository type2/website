Subject: '71 1600 DP Engine puzzle

For anyone who remembers, I had a tussle with a mechanic over an engine 
he built and was trying to weasel out of the warrantee. Well, I decided 
to do the work myself.

Situation: 120 all around except for 90 in #3 cylinder.

I pulled the engine, took off the left head, to find a bunch of bent fins 
and the entire head warped. The head nuts were mostly loose on the #3 
side. Also, the push rods have wear marks on them - they're rubbing 
somewhere. The heads are made by GEX, and the mechanic told me that they 
were cheapies, and he wasn't buying from them anymore.

He told me he'd replace the head (give me a new one of a different 
brand for me to install) if anything was wrong. What I'm wondering:

SHould I really try to get him to replace both heads? The other head 
looks okay, but I didn't pull it.

What's with the worn push rods?

The air control bellows was missing. Is it hard to acquire?

What caused the darn head to warp in the first place? Is there some 
sinister heat problem? Then engine is extremely clean on the outside, and 
the heads were obviously newly rebuilt.

How should the pistons look after &lt; 2000 miles? I'm trying to verify that 
this mechanic actually did the work he said, I don't have the highest 
opinion of his ethics or workmanship.

 Advice is definitely appreciated,

Jon
