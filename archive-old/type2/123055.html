&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I am in the process of ordering some Boge shocks for the 78 Westfalia.  Does
&gt; anyone have any compelling reasons why I would want to order the KYB has
&gt; adjust??

The KYB gas adjusts are to damned stiff for a bus, imho.  I can't wait
for them to wear out so I can justify..or at least remember..to replace
them.

&gt; It seems to me I have read posts where the gas adjust didn't bolt up
&gt; right or were too short or something.

I'm fairly sure that has always been related to wrong-part syndrome.
