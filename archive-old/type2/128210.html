Subject: CV Joint Death Rattle?

Hi List,

Last night I was driving my Westy home (I've decided
to call her &quot;Rustfalia&quot;) and despite lavishing some
expensive new Michelin tyres on her last week, I was
horrified to hear some new &quot;death rattle&quot; noises at
the back, which were only under load (and worse in the
turns) so I can only assume my CVs are toast!

I'm thinking about just replacing the whole lot, and
buying new CVs already on the axles so they're faster
and easier to put in.. FYI: I'll be doing this in the
street - I lost my garage when I moved 9/1.

Where can I get LOBRO joints and axles, already
greased and ready to put on, for sensible money??

Should I even consider anything that isn't LOBRO? I
see that bus DEPOT has complete CV's on axles, but it
doesn't say if they're genuine LOBRO parts..

I only want to do this job once, of course..

TIA,
Dave Burton
