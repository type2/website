Subject: Re: [T2] clutch from 1700 with 2000 engine

for real? i was just discussing putting a 78 / 2.0L in my up-to-this-point
stock 75. then i cracked muir (jan. 1991; 14th ed.) and found it doesn't
have 435 pages. is this written in a newer edition muir...?   - steve

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;In my Muir Book Chapter XX page 435, co-authors John Hilgert and Peter
&gt;Achwanden discuss a problem with a 75 transmission in a 78 bus. Oil seal
&gt;failures along with pilot shaft bearing  failure. Cause was =ECthe pilot sh=
aft
&gt;on a =EB75 is too short for a =EB78 only a =EB76 to =EB78 will work.=EE
&gt;Also somewhere I read that optimum valve size for FI and Carbs are not the
&gt;same.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck.
&gt;
&gt;Chuck Watson
