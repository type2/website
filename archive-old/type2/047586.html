You know, I took a little offense to that, too. I was
a bug guy for 15 years before I ever owned my first
bus, and if I had come across that attitude, I never
would have gotten into them. I'm especially surprised
at it on this list, since a lot of bus guys seem to
see the bay window crowd as sort of a bastard child
anyway. 

I'm a member of several Bug and Ghia clubs, but I've
noticed that nobody seems to have as much fun as the
bus people. I'd hate to see anyone excluded from that
group for lack of knowledge. We didn't all come into
this world as bus experts, and some of us may bumble
along in blissful ignorance for the rest of our lives,
and I say Bravo! to those who feel they can get along
that way, and do. 

I see the attitude expressed most often from the Ghia
folks (FLAME SUIT IN PLACE FOR THIS NEXT COMMENT),
many of whom I find to be wannabe Porsche guys. That
attitude of not wanting the newbie just sucks, and I
for one am firmly offended.

Oh, and one more comment - I am not, have never been,
and am likely never to be a hippy, but I don't fault
them for their way of life, and I'll help any of them
fix his or her bus, buy themselves a bus, or do
anything else to any VW they own, for the simple
reason that they love the damn things as much as I do.

Sincerely,
John Cloonan

&gt; Why Mike, why?    why do you say that?   what is
&gt; wrong with someone wanting 
&gt; an old bus to travel in?     I think it is great.  
&gt; ...I went and got
&gt; a bus to travel in , and 
&gt; went on Dead Tour with my friends.  It was one of
&gt; those VW vans with a 
&gt; sliding door and a pop top a person could sleep in
&gt; and an ice box with a 
&gt; water pump and sink, and a tire on the front.   It
&gt; was very cool.   
&gt; ...Jeez  is this the anti hippy thread again?   or
is
&gt; it anti new bus people?   
&gt; OKay who knew everything about buses when they first
&gt; got one?   
&gt; ...Mink
&gt;  P.S.  Here is what I want:  the kind of bus with
&gt; the tire on the front,
&gt;  a pop top for sleeping, and a little sink console,
&gt; the sliding side
&gt;  door, and a back door too.  This is what I lived in
&gt; when I was little &gt;&gt;
