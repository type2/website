Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

Ok   I am going to try and decipher what Bob said. Apparently its not the
jetting (although I have heard thats wrong too), but rather the
&quot;progressive&quot; part. When at idle only one bbl feeds the gas, but as you
accelerate then they both do. He is saying that wears out your engine. He
suggests retrofitting fuel injection (and tranny, etc.) from a 79 bus. He
will warrant with dual carbs. He doesn't recommend the progressive weber
though. Here is a pic of my centermount weber:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/spiff12.jpg which is so readily available and much
more affordable even at around $300. I have seen many buses with this setup,
but I think I will switch, especially with 0 miles on a new rebuilt.


Hope I got that right.

&gt; &gt;Boston Bob ... doesn't give a warranty for an
&gt; engine with the weber carb on it. ...At the least I
&gt; would need new dual carbs for a warranty.
&gt;
&gt; He won't warrant an engine with a weber progressive or
&gt; any weber?  Will warrant Dellortos?  New dual carbs
&gt; means stock or any dual carbs?  I thought all
&gt; aftermarket carbs were jetted wrong for VW
&gt; applications and need to be properly jetted.  Is the
&gt; progressive completely incapable of being jetted
&gt; properly?
