Subject: Re: [T2] review of &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; also &quot;Cars&quot;

&quot;Cars&quot;  played at High Country Bus Festival last year.  It was 
obviously a bootleg because it hadn't been released on DVD at that 
time.  It was a large (projection?) screen (measured in feet rather 
than inches) and the quality wasn't stellar, but it sure was fun to 
watch it with a bunch of like-minded people.

I'm guessing the theater was rigged up by the Tennessee Mechanized 
Division of the Full Moon Bus Club.
