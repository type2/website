Subject: $4.00 Paint Job

Turtle Wax:  $3.96 at Wal-Mart.

Rags:  Scrounged for free from old holey towels.

The look on their face when they see that your old paid-for bus shines as
much as their $500-a-month Lexus: PRICELESS!

Elbow Grease...it's everywhere you want to be.

&lt;Wax on&gt;
I've found that the oxidized paint comes off better with paste wax and
massive amounts of elbow grease than it does with rubbing compound. I'm
having to basically do 2 coats of wax to get an even look, but the 28
year-old paint blue is reviving quite nicely, minus scratches and rust
spots. I have a buffer, but I'm having better luck with my own arms.
&lt;/Wax off&gt;
