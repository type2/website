Yah, my plan was to verify the switch and test by manually shorting the
circuit with my wife watching the brake lights first, since the other
filament in the brake light bulb is working when the headlights are on (so
I figured the grounds/sockets/etc. in the taillight assemblies were ok).

Actually, this reminds me... some advice on removing the taillight
assembly would be useful.. it looks like these things snap in, rather
than screw down.  I need to remember to take my headlamp out with me
the next time I work on the Bus, but it never hurts to narrow down where
to look :-)

Thanks!
