Subject: Re: [T2] backfiring under load

hi , after reading your post i have a couple questions for ya, do you have 
points and condenser or electronic ignition, and do you have single carb or 
dual. an exhaust leak would cause more backfiring when you take your foot off 
the gas pedal, like when going down hill, if it is an electronic ignition you 
have, then double check the little screw that holds the unit to your 
distibutor on the inside of the distributor itself, i have hadthis come loose 
on me and it caused loss of power and back firing, -- but if you have points 
and condensor, definately check your gap in the points, that would definately 
cause backfiring. also one other thing to check is take a look at your spark 
plug wires, if there is a crack in them or they are old, you could be arcing 
from the crack to some part of your engine, .. gimme a call if you like im 
north of boston in mass, and i could walk you through any of these 
procedures, .. also while your distributor cap is off wipe the contact points 
on the cap itself clean.. good luck and relax brother, its the trip not the 
destination =) scott -- 781 274 0750.
