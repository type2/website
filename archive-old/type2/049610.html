&gt; I stopped by Costco today.  They sell a 6 ply &quot;c&quot; rated all season 195/75R14
&gt; tire under the name &quot;Kirkland&quot;.  Salesman said they are manufactured at a
&gt; Uniroyal plant (owned by Michelin), and the tire did seem a lot like the
&gt; Uniroyal Laredo.
&gt; 
&gt; I compared the tread etc to the Michelin LTX M/S nearby, and it was fairly
&gt; close in style, with a little more siping on the Michelin, and a solid
&gt; centre tread on the &quot;Kirkand&quot;.  About the same tread depth.  Kirkland was
&gt; blackwall both sides, quite plain, which I find attractive in a VW Van tire.

I've no experience with Kirtland, but I have had a set of Uniroyals in
195/75R14.  They showed considerable &quot;stepping&quot; on the front tires after
about 10,000 miles.  My front end is in good shape, so I doubt that the
stepping is due to any problem there.  I replaced them with Bridgestones,
which didn't
seeem to step the same way.  The Laredos were also considerably smaller in
diameter than the 185R14 Bridgestones.  If you do buy the 195/75R14 size,
be sure to get it in load range &quot;D&quot;, as &quot;C&quot; isn't strong enough in this
size.
