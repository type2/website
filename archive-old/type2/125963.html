&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; There are many people on the list that enjoy helping other VW owners. You need to
respect their help by first providing background information with every request
for help before you ask a question. It is frustrating, and often a big waste of
time, trying to guess what make, model, year, and engine type you have. All of
which is very important to correctly diagnose a problem.

Wow,, that is most elegant way of saying it!,,,


Please,, Every request for help,,, include as much background info including the
subject line,, as that makes it sooo much easier to find in the archives

I like that so much I think I will save that message!
