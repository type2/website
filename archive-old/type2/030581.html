Subject: Insurance on fire - 80 Westy

Hi,

I joined the list to get advice - my poor 1980 Westy caught fire last
night and burned completely. It had 130,00 overall, rebuilt engine in
1985. An independent agency for the insurance company (State Farm) will
determine the current retail price...any advice, commentary, etc....

Thanks,

Andree
