Subject: Re: [T2] Oil change gasket set - $2.79

Well, call me stupid, but what the heck is an 'oil change gasket set?'  I've changed mine many times and have never bought one.  Maybe that explains my oil leak.  Or leaks.  That and the pressure sensor.  Thanks, Dave, for that knowledge.  Cheers...KR

I needed a set.  Pep Boys didn't have them.  I didn't bother with Auto 
Zone, Advance or O'Reilly.  NAPA has usually pulled through for me when 
others were empty handed, but $3.05 with tax is just a little 
far-fetched.  It says &quot;Made in America&quot; and I'm grateful for that fact, 
but I don't think that 3 times the price of imported products is 
reasonable.

I just bought a bunch of these from one of our online vendors for 89 
cents each.

Thanks for the bandwidth.  I had to rant.
