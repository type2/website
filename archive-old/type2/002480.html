The heat exchangers on my van are seriously shot, and expensive to
replace - typically 145 UK pounds each, and I already got stung with some
used ones at a swap meet which aren't right, so I was interested when Just
Kampers were advertising at 199 UKP a pair. Unfortunately these are for
1972-78 and 1980-83 models.

Anybody know if its feasible to modify any of these years to fit a
79? The ones I need have square air inlets and a separate duct in from the
electric fan.
