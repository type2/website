Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment question!



&gt; Hey Will,
&gt; There should be a mark on your distributor that is pointing back and
&gt; slightly to the right out of the hatch of your engine compartment door
&gt; .. at about this angle
&gt; 
&gt; |front of car|
&gt; |            |
&gt; |            |
&gt; |  dizzy     |
&gt; |      \     |
&gt; |            |
&gt; |back of car |
&gt; 
&gt; see that diagonal line underneath dizzy, that's about the angle that the
&gt; little line on the rim of the distrubutor should be pointing.  Spin your
&gt; alternator bolt until the rotor lines up with it and then you have TDC.

Another way to find TDC on #1 is to rotate the crank until the TDC mark
is aligned with the case seam, then crawl under and wiggle the rockers
on #1.  If both have a bit of play you are on the right TDC and you can go
ahead and adjust.  If not, rotate the engine one full turn and wiggle again.

I do the wiggle test on each cylinder before I check it, just to make sure
that I haven't had a brain freeze and rotated the engine the wrong direction.

If the setting has tightened so much that all clearance is gone at TDC, 
you have more serious problems than a valve adjustment will cure.
 
&gt; Then go ahead and adjust cylinder one.  Then spin the engine so the
&gt; rotor turns counter-clockwise 90 degrees from that position, and you
&gt; have cylinder two, then three, then four.  Piece-o-cake :)
&gt; 
&gt; To remove the valve covers, a drum brake tool works WONDERS!

Amen to that.  I have a wide one that I use just for valve covers.  Doesn't
even scratch the paint.

&gt; remove the spark plugs and it makes it easier to spin the engine, and
&gt; it's a good time to install new ones if you want...

I don't generally do that.  A ratchet on the generator nut is generally
enough leverage to turn the engine easily, even with the spark plugs
in.

Buy a stack of valve cover gaskets (they're cheap) and replace them
every time the cover is off.  I use Hylomar on the valve cover side of the
gasket and nothing on the head side.  Cleans up nicely when you change
the gasket.
