Subject: Re: New wood paneling?

&gt; I would recommend you consider &quot;door skins&quot; to re-ceil your bus. Some 
&gt; lumberyards have this stuff-it's a VERY thin veneer used to re-face doors. 
&gt; Home Depot, Lowes, usually have it. Smaller local yards can get it. About a 
&gt; 1/16 of an inch or so in thickness. It's bendy, so it will take the curve. 

If you use doorskins I would suggest using thompsons sealer on the whole
thing after you cut it front back sides all. The stuff will delaminate
pretty readily. You can get a nice finish but it takes quite a bit more
work than with a birch veneer as the wood has a fairly rough grain to it
(compared to birch that is).
