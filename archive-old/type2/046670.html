Subject: [T2] Low oil pressure at low speeds

1500 H series engine in a bus.  Appears stock.

Carb was dumping gas into engine for an undetermined amount of time (I
just bought it) - black plugs and lots of gas in the oil, which has been
since replaced.

Oil light takes a few seconds to go out after starting and comes on at
normal idle.  Sometimes comes on almost as soon as I take my foot off
the gas.  Revving to est. 1500 RPM makes it go out.

My guess is the bad flooding &quot;cleaned&quot; the engine to the extent that
bearings are now loose enough to reduce oil pressure.

I'm wondering if a &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump might keep me from having to
tear down the engine.  It's not my dailiy driver -- I'd like to keep it
runnable for once or twice a week pleasure trips around town.

Any suggestions on further diagnostics or baling-wire solutions
appreciated!
