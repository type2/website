Tech class of 85 The  Final Emotion

by Will Stewart, TechSideline_dot_com
General  Manager and Managing Editor
Apr 18, 2007     
I am in the  business of writing, of articulating my thoughts, of putting 
into words what  others may only sense as a blur of feelings. I have never backed 
down from the  challenge, be it capturing the emotion of a landmark victory, 
the pain of an  agonizing defeat, the triumph and heartbreak that are part and 
parcel of  athletics, even the horror of 9/11 over five years ago. It is my 
calling, my  passion, my God-given talent. But I fear this ... this is too much.

I am  not speaking lightly when I say that I cannot comprehend the loss 
suffered by  the families, friends, and loved ones of this tragedy. I have tried to 
imagine  what it must be like to suddenly lose someone close to you in this 
way. But I  can't. I have a wife and three children, and when I try to put 
myself in that  place, that terrible place where so many people have been thrown 
with no  recourse, I can't.

It has only been two days since it happened, but it  feels like forever. I am 
exhausted from being exposed to the brunt of it, from  the message boards to 
the constant news coverage, to the conversations of family  and friends, to 
the scenes on the Virginia Tech campus. Others have said they  can't sleep. Not 
I. When I have fallen into bed past midnight the last two  nights, sleep has 
come easily. It's getting up the next morning that has been  difficult.

We never thought this would be us. We have watched these kinds  of tragedies 
from afar, but this one has hit us where we live. The media have  descended 
from around the world, poking, prodding, and worst of all, trying to  place 
blame. An immense amount of pressure has been brought to bear on the  Virginia 
Tech community, first by Cho Seung-Hui himself and then by the crush of  
international attention. While some of the coverage has been compassionate, much  of 
it has not been, and some of it has bordered on cruel and sensationalistic.  
None of this surprises me, but being at the center of it still stings, and it  
changes your perceptions forever.

As I searched for meaning in what  happened, I finally found it. I found it 
in the incredible poise, control, and  togetherness shown by the Virginia Tech 
family. The true character of a person,  group, or institution shows itself 
under pressure, and what the Virginia Tech  community has shown us is grace, 
cohesion, intelligence, and  compassion.

I have always thought that there was something different  about Hokies, and 
the last few days have proven it. We always talk about the  passion that Hokies 
have for Virginia Tech, about the special connection they  feel to the 
university, and this tragedy has shown that talk doesn't ring  hollow. If it wasn't 
true, if there wasn't a special bond between members of the  Virginia Tech 
community, then they would have flown apart in the face of this  adversity. They 
did not. They drew together and showed the world a united  front.

Those interviewed by the media refused, for the most part, to be  drawn into 
the baiting questions that sought to place blame on university  president 
Charles Steger and the Virginia Tech Police Department. The very  students who 
were in danger Monday let the world know where they stand when they  applauded 
Dr. Steger at Tuesday's convocation service. The vultures were  circling, hoping 
to pick the bones, but the people at Virginia Tech refused.  They showed what 
it means to be Hokies. They drew together.

The students  in particular have exceeded my expectations. We tend to think 
of them just as  kids. Loud, shallow, self-centered, focused on the trivial, 
often spoiled.  Adorned with body piercings, tattoos, and too much facial hair.

What we  have seen instead, in the countless interviews of students on news 
channels up  and down the dial, are bright, articulate, respectful individuals 
that any  university would be flattered to call its own. Well-groomed, 
well-spoken,  wearing dress clothes, ties, even suits, patiently answering questions, 
keeping  their composure in the face of more than most of us will ever 
experience. I am  on the one part humbled -- they are better people than I was at 
their age -- and  on the other part proud. Well done, students of Virginia Tech. 
You are  representative of the type of people Virginia Tech is admitting and 
producing --  you, not Cho Seung-Hui -- and I am proud of both you and my  
university.

From the beautiful and gifted Reema Samaha to the cheerful,  intelligent and 
talented Ryan Clark, Cho's victims were pictures of inspiration.  These were 
not vapid, self-centered individuals. It is sad that their lives were  cut 
short, but perhaps the way they conducted those lives will inspire others.  They 
make me wish I could go through college again, to be more like  them.

By the nature of what I do for a living, my window into the  Virginia Tech 
world is athletics. Among the fans, athletics is about passion. It  is about 
pride in victory and anguish in defeat. These emotions are always  strong, always 
out of proportion to the importance of the games themselves, but  I have 
always felt that with Virginia Tech fans, there was something beyond the  typical 
fan relationship with their sports teams. Now that I have seen that  passion 
and togetherness extend beyond the playing fields and the stadiums and  
coliseums and into the glare of this awful spotlight, I know it to be  true.

Being a Hokie is not a mercenary relationship. It is not a business  
proposition. It is not an exchange of goods and services for money. It is a  shared 
bond, a love that comes from somewhere we don't understand and can't  explain to 
others. We do not take from this university; it gives to us. Perhaps  when we 
first arrive on its campus, we have our own selfish interests in mind,  but 
by the time we leave, we are transformed. We are Hokies.

It is sad  and tragic that this happened to us. Because we love this 
university, we are  devastated by what happened here. But if it was necessary for us 
to suffer in  order for others to benefit, it is a burden we will bear, because 
our motto --  Ut Prosim, That I May Serve -- tells us that's what we must do. 
If our tragedy  brings you together, if our loss makes you safer and makes 
you value what is  important in life, if our suffering is not in vain, then we 
are prepared to  shoulder this load ... so you don't have to. That has always 
been the mission of  this university, and we are honored to carry it out.

Do not let the  deaths of these 32 victims be in vain. Look into your hearts 
and see what it  teaches you, and how you may be better because of what we 
have gone through. And  know that when the bodies are in the earth, when the 
media has left, when others  have moved on and life resumes its course, that for 
us, there is only one  emotion left: Love. Love for this university, love for 
the people who died on  April 16th, 2007, and love for those who are left 
behind.

Remember this,  and what happened here will not have been for naught.
