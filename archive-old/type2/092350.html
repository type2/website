Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.

Hi Chris:

The part number on the ECU is 039 906 021B, which according to ETKA, is the
correct part number for Federal vehicles, CA' part number is 071-906-021 B. My
vehicle only had one owner and had less than 50k when I got it so I believe
that it is original. The harness also stock and no extra connector lying about.

I opened it up at lunch and it is missing the second board (I believe that the
CA version has two, see
http://home.swipnet.se/joakim_adolfson/lotus/html/injection-text.html for more
details). In addition pins 23 and 24 are not connected, though it looks as if
the circuitry exists to handle input on these pins. I will ask on the DIY-EFI
group if anyone knows more about adding an oxygen sensor to the federal unit,
otherwise it looks as if my options are to install Megasquirt or get the CA ECU
and other components.

Anyone gutting a CA bus and selling things cheap?

Regards and thanks for the thoughts.

&gt; Anyhow I believe all of the Vanagons and the busses starting in '79 had
&gt; oxygen sensors. If you have the original engine harness and original
&gt; computer it should be a plug in affair.
&gt;
&gt; Can you give us the part# for the computer and somebody will know (usually
&gt; Karl) if that is the right computer. I can check ETKA also.
&gt;
&gt; In theory I would GUESS that a bum Vanagon computer could be swapped for an
&gt; earlier non-oxygen sensor equipped transporter computer which would not
&gt; support the sensor. If may be a situation where you've got the pins but not
&gt; the electronics to run that oxygen sensor.
