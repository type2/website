Subject: Re: Unfreezing rear wheels

When I got Stella (June of 99) she was rough...
2 flat tires, had been sitting for years, and the rear drivers wheel was locked up.  I got a flatbed to the place and we
used the winch to haul it up onto the flatbed.  The tire just dragged all the way up....
I got it home and we unloaded it in a good spot in the driveway where I was to work on it for the next month to make it
roadworthy (which I did...all by myself!! woo woo! plus the idiotic questions I asked the list...hehehe...remember
that?!)  What I did to unfreeze the wheel was take a hammer...and tap the drum all the way around repeatedly... then put
the wheel back on and push the bus back and forth...rock it...
eventually my wheel became unfrozen....

new brake shoes are a great idea too :)
my rear brakes need attention soon.....but you can only do so many things at once...  I have disc brakes (which I recently
rebuilt and installed new pads) that do a great job of braking...but the rear brakes are next on the list...
when I got Stella...she wouldn't even run...I heard her run (loud with that rusted out muffler!!!) before i bought
her...and I have no idea how the PO got her to start....but he did...


so a lot of rocking the bus should do it..


&gt;
&gt; 1) would pulling it out with a winch unfreeze the wheels or would it just skid onto the flatbed?
&gt; 2) assuming I make it to my house, what are my prospects for loosening the wheels up? Will 5 cans of wd-40 and a
&gt; good drum puller do the job?   Any experience out there?
