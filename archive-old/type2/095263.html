improv camping spot

We were going to Northern Georgia to a state park to go camping but the bus 
got to hot and the thread on the number 3 cylinder came loose.  At an auto 
parts store met a VW guy with 2 beetles that let us camp outside his house 
and we put silicone around the plug to seel it and made it home on 3 
cylinders.

Going to be pulling a head from my parts engine to replace.
