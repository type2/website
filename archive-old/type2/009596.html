 From: vw rookie;

 to whom it may concern at the busboys company,
 i asked about lowering my bus on the list a couple months ago, and
 someone from your company e-mailed me and told me that they could help me
on 
 lowering the front suspension on my 72 westy. they gave me a phone number 
 but i must have lost it. so if it's no problem i would like it if i could 
 get some info. thanks.
