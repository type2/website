&gt; &gt;From: Access Systems yup, hauled my 78 from Richmond to Baltimore without a
&gt; &gt;problem, the bigger
&gt; &gt;the truck the easier the haul in my opinion.  I used a 4 wheel trailer.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Bob that was going to be my next question. 4 wheel or 2 wheel with
&gt; axles removed.

for that long a haul, get all the bus wheels off the ground, lash down
really well, make sure all the trailer tires are equally full. take your
time, enjoy the trip
