hi all,

Now, everyone always says you cant run a VW hard... i say BS on that.

If you couldnt run a vw hard and have it take it, why are taxicabs in
mexico almost universally ACVW? i'm sure they dont take it easy on their
engines...

I have driven my 71 bus on an engine i rebuilt myself probably 70-80k
without incident (well nothing major anyway) including 70+ MPH indicated
speeds on 80% of this driving. (including a run to texas and back in
july... it was so hot i had to close the windows to avoid the blast
furnace)

Now, i have a t1 bus as i hate t4's (personal opinion only, nothign wrong 
with em i suppose) but i am nto a fan of protecting people from
themselves... so i'll give you the real scoop on speed in a bus...

VW engines hate LOAD not rpm's.  Cruising on the flat in my 71 at an
indicated 70 or so, doesnt put much load on the engine.  Now if i try to
do that uphill, i'll kill it. So, go forth and remeber, if your engine is
turning fast its blowing air fast, if its turning slow its blowing air
slow.  You need to figure out where you get the most air, and the least
heat... I find this to be around 70 in my 71 and around 65 mph in my
61. Downshift when you have to put the pedal to the floor and the bus
still doesnt go faster.

If you drive your bus at 55, i think it will be worse off, anything below
3000 rpm for cruising is lugging the motor, and will hurt it if placed
under load, especially if you have a 77 or newer bus with the higher
gearing.  On one of those i'd almost guess 55 is safe in third... but i
dont really remeber much about the gearing on one of those anymore, just
that its hella taller than my 71.

take care,

Steve
