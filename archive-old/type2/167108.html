Subject: Dipstick Boot

Hey all,

I found an oil leak on my '76 Westy (there may be more). The dipstick boot is
torn. What is the best way the replace this? Do you just remove the alternator
belt and the cover that the tube runs through or is there more to it? Just
looking for advise before I start tearing things apart.

Thanks,

Doug
Minneapolis, MN
