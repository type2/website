Subject: It's alive

In the words of Dr. Frankenstein: &quot;It's alive! IT'S ALIIIIIIIIVE!!!&quot;

I would like to thank all of you who helped me get my bus' wiring figured
out. With the help of several Volks (especially Tom and Thanh &amp; Marco
Robert) I am up and running. The wiring was my latest problem and I am
thankful for all those who helped on the other questions I posed.

These lists are wonderful assets. I will be making a donation to the fund.

She runs pretty well. The motor is fine, I bought a new Brazil/Mexico one 18
months ago for my bug, and it still runs great. I am having a problem going
into 3rd gear on both up and down shift. I will be looking into that this
week. All I need to do now is have her inspected and get a radio.

That's all for now. Thanks again for the help, but don't think I'm done
asking questions: I have to restore her still.

See you at EBUS02

Later,
Jim
