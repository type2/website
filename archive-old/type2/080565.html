Subject: RE: [T2] 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine

&gt; the heads had been SANDblasted instead of glass bead
&gt; blasted. the old guides were still in it (they were
&gt; sandblasted too), and i was given OLD valves (some had
&gt; RUST on them). the WORST part about these head came
&gt; when i trial fit a cylinder into the holes in the
&gt; head. the cylinder would SLIDE side-to-side, a very
&gt; loose fit in the head. this is definitely NOT KOSHER
&gt; and i will be sending these back to busdepot soon.
&gt;
&gt; under the rocker covers i thought i could make out a
&gt; stamp that said SIR. i thought busdepot sold rebuilt
&gt; parts from AVP, but these didnt say AVP anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; i must apologize to RON for taking it to the list
&gt; before taking it to him, and it is in no way his
&gt; fault. I am in no way badmouthing your business. I buy
&gt; almost ALL of my bus parts from busdepot. my rebuilt
&gt; AVP 2.0 that i bought from him is still kickin strong
&gt; after almost 30k, and the heads on IT said GEX under
&gt; the valve covers! (i guess (hope)they were rebuilt
&gt; more than once)
&gt;
&gt; so RON, i'll be in touch with you to rectify this as
&gt; soon as i can find some TIME (precious commodity of
&gt; which i have little).


Well, as you said, it would have been nice for you to have emailed this to
me privately before griping to 1000 people. Somehow you &quot;found the time&quot; to
post this to the list, but couldn't &quot;find the time&quot; to email me directly and
give me a chance to look into it and resolve it  first?????

We use AVP exclusively for all of our type 4 and wasserboxer engines and
rebuilt heads  - never SIR, GEX, or anyone else for that matter.  I have
never found AVP to be anything less than 150% supportive of their (and our)
customers.  I can say with great certainty that if there is anything wrong
with the heads, they will replace them without a hassle.  Also, I have NOT
ONCE had an AVP head fail due to any sort of remanufacturing defect. Their
track record by me has been better than any other parts vendor I deal with.
And even when there was an issue that could have been a gray area, such as a
questionable core, etc., they have always erred on the side of the customer.
I could not possibly ask for a company that stands behind their product
better than AVP does.  With regard to the head being rebuilt more than once,
this is entirely possible.  It has been nearly 25 years since these heads
were new. It is highly likely that in 25 years the heads have indeed been
rebuilt somewhere along the way.  This is the case no matter where the head
is rebuilt.  The question is, how well is it rebuilt?  As I have said, I
have NEVER had a problem with AVP's rebuilds, which is why I use them even
though I could make a better profit selling heads from other rebuilders.

In any event, give Erin at AVP a call toll-free at 1-800-548-5766.  You may
have to leave a message, as they are a small family-owned operation and do
not always answer the phone, but she will get back to you.  I will also
forward her your email and my response. I have absolutely no doubt that Erin
and Leonard will be more than helpful in resolving the situation without a
hassle.  If you are for any reason unable to obtain a satisfactory
resolution, just shoot me an email (directly).
