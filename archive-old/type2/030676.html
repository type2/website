&gt; In the manual, there was some mention that the vacuum port on the rear of

Ok.

the large port on the distributor, I guess it is the rear one.  Connect it
to the port on the rear of the carb, that sticks STRAIGHT out.  The
slanted one is to be blocked off.  EOF.:)

&gt; And if the line doesn't run to the intake manifold, why is that vacuum port
&gt; on the manifold there at all?

Good question.  The pollution control device in question here, I guess, is
the throttle positioner valve.  It kept the throttle from closing all the
way when decelerating, to prevent a incorrect, and pollution causing
mixture (lean? rich? I dont remember..:).

My guess is that IT connected to this port, though I think I'm wrong. Or
there might have been 2 types of it.  (the manifold on my 74 Super had a
larger outlet, that faced rear, and had 2 threaded holes...with a plate
over it.;p  It was an autostick, so it had the large vac outlet to the
clutch servo, and the smaller outlet to the solinoid....anyhow.:)

I really dont know what DOES go here, or on the slanted port on the rear
(but towards the pass side...) of the carb. I DO know (and did a lot of
checking up on this, ~ 1-2 years ago, but cant put my finger on exactly
where I found the information..) that the small port on the distr, goes to
the side port on the carb.  And the large port goes to the rear port on
the carb.

The side port is for advance (vacuum AND centrifugal advance in those
dist's..).  It is metered ABOVE the throttle plate, so as the air is
rushing into the carb increases, the advance increases.

The rear port is metered BELOW the throttle plate, and is the retard side
of the diaphram.  When the throttle snaps shut, the vacuum below this
plate jumps for a second or so.  It retards the timing to help prevent
backfires, and such. (and you dont need advance upon deceleration!)


So. there you have it.  Somebody correct me if I'm wrong (this is all from
memory..I cant point to any one place I learned it, but I DO know I put a
hell of a lot of free time into understanding it...;p ) but I dont think
I am, or at least, not to far.:)


Good luck!
