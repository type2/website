&lt;&lt;  I bought two new 13mm wrenches (12 point and a 6 point count on the 
boxes) 
&gt; just recently from Lowes.
&gt; 
&gt; They are the brand that they sell with their lifetime warranty.
&gt; I think their brand name is &quot;Kobalt&quot;, or some such. &gt;&gt;

Unless I'm terribly mis-remembering (political term), the Lowes 
&quot;Kobalt&quot; line is the Snap-on &quot;Blue Point&quot; line.
Home Depot's &quot;Husky&quot; line is Stanley, once of New Britain, Conn.,
now a phone booth in Bermuda...;-(
