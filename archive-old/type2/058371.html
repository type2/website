Subject: is an extractor necessary?

Earlier this year, I completely rebuilt a 1776 which was in the '71 Westy
that I bought. I bought Berg semi hemi heads,  an extractor, and a dual
muffler to team with the dual Kadron which were already there.  Because the
engine was reaching temps of 250 on the interstate, I pulled it and am
running it on a test stand in the garage - trying to diagnose several
problems.  The amount of heat generated at the pipes of the extractor is
just awesome.  All the paint on the sheet metal near the pipes has peeled
off.   Even though I have all sheet metal and seals in the engine
compartment, I am wondering if radiation from the extractor  is not
partially responsible for my 250 degrees.

My question:  I would eliminate this source of heat if I replaced the
extractor/dual mufflers with a stock bus muffler.  Is a 1776 + dual Kadrons
+ stock muffler an ok combination?  The application is a daily driver
around town with occasional interstate speeds.  Has anyone experience with
this combination?

Thanks, Jack
