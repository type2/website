Subject: To all Computer Nuts

I am looking for a 5400 or better Baud rated modem for my laptop, so it
has to be an external, perferably a haynes, but that is not necessary. 

For everyday use the modem I have now which is a Haynes 1200 is fine. But 
trying to get all the messages from this list and read them is quite an
interesting task. So I am asking anyone out who will part with a little
better modem quite cheaply. Name some prices and I'll try to get back to
you.

By the way, laptop work wonders on college term papers while exploring in 
ones bus. Especially a Westi where all you have to do is &quot;plug in&quot;. Now
if the damn park service would install phone jacks along with power, than 
we would never be away from this list (wouldn't that be great).

And imagine if you could use a cell to &quot;roam&quot; with your computer. God,
than in time of need all you need to do is use that battery and log on if 
any problems arise. And great some excellant advice on how to remedy it.
The perfect world, right?

Well if anyone can help me out with a modem please send info. It would
help to speed things along, especially when on two different lists and
than any other mail recieved (non list members).
