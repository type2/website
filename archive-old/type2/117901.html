Subject: more turn signal woes

K so to recap Either way i turn my turn signal switch both sides of the 
extorior lights blink at the same time instead of just the left or just the 
right.  There were 2 wires previously cut off, when i recieved the bus, a 
brown which i traced back to a bolt in the back, obviously a ground.  and a 
brown and white which goes back to the E flasher relay. Whenever i try to 
connect either one, and then turn on the turn signal a fuse blows. All the 
connections have been cleaned, and i traced all the wires and they seem to 
be where they need to be. Also right under the front of the bus all the 
wires that go to the back of the bus have been hand reconnected, looking 
like someone tried to replace the switch before and had to cut and splice 
the wires back together, and I double checked that that section was 
connected right. So please I want to get this street legal ASAP help me!
