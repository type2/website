sounds like what i have seen others do when they turn on the wipers before
unsticking them from the ice on the windshiled.  ( you sunny living folks
don't have the fun of this happening...!!!)

folks will go out on a frosty cold morning with a bunch of ice/snow on the
windshield and turn on the wipers and the motor will go but the wipers will
not move.  that is not a good thing!!  you might want to see if the wiper
ARM is stripped on the wiper SHAFT.  it is a very finely, splined little
number and strips easy.  

of course a good way to strip out those splines is when someone doesnt like
where the wipers will *park*, or notices the wipers go *to far*, kind of off
the side of the windshield or whatever.  and they just grab the wiper arm
and *move* it to the position they need.  i say *move*, cuz i should
say...*strip* it to where they want it to stop.

i HAVE been able to fix stripped wiper arms.  who knows maybe the arms were
just loose on the shaft!!  you never know, you could get lucky, and just
tighten them up.

either way,

have fun,
zzz
