Subject: Help! Big chunk of metal in the oil!!

	Got a nice surprise while changing the oil yesterday.  When I 
removed the oil strainer from my '72 1700 there was a good sized chunk 
of aluminum sitting in the case just outside the strainer.  The chunk 
does not resemble anything, it is machined on two sides (top and bottom?).
one machined surface is really shiny and smooth, the other surface is 
just cut or formed and not polished.
The rest of it looks like it was broken off of something and is covered in 
DEEP fracture lines.  The piece is about the size and dimension of my 
ring finger nail.  it is a little less than 3/8 of an inch thick and half 
as wide on top as on the bottom.  
	I know these dimensions do not help much with something that is 
broken and mashed but if someone can give me some ideas as to what I 
should do I would appreciate it.
	The strange thing is that the bus still runs and sounds fine.
Thanks for your help.
ED
