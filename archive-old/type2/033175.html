Subject: diesel opinions

Dear list,

I am looking at an 82 vanagon diesel westy and would like any opinions that
fellow listees may have.  I know that the main con for this vehicle is its
lack of power, but owning a 74 1800 automatic, I am somewhat used to this. 
Can anyone give me opinions, ideas or suggestions on this van?  Also, what
would be a reasonable price for a rust free 82 diesel with 35,000 original
miles?

TIA
