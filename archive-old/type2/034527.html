Subject: who was looking for air breather (free)

as the above states.  i have an old air breather for the guy, who a
couple days ago needed one.  i deleted his address not thinking that i
would find a spare one in my junk boxes!! just to make sure i have the
correct part needed...it is the small black box that is next to the
dipstick on a old 411 motor (with the upright dipstick, in almost the
center of the case??) then you connect the hose to one of the carbs to
suck off the positive crankcase fumes. do i have the right part you
need?

it yours if you still need it.  and the hefty price tag
attached...?....NOTHING...yippeeee...8-P

zzz

*or if anyone else could use it...let me know.
