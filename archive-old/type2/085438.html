Subject: Re: [T2] cv joints, clunk, clunk

Hi Joel,

This is still very likely to be a CV joint problem. When under throttle the
CV joint-to-bearing surface is engaged differently than when coasting or
decelerating, and it could be that this is the bearing face that is galled.

My bus used to only make the clunk after a left turn. Sometimes it would go
away immediately, sometimes it would persist for a couple of miles. My
mechanic repacked the CV's with fresh grease and they've lasted for
thousands of miles since.

BTW, what's the recommended service interval on CV joints???   I think I may
want to check mine before I head off to Everybus. Adam, I think yours should
probably be checked too.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey, I have a clunk, clunk, when I am accelerating, but goes away when I
&gt; disengage the clutch.  CVs would still make noise, right?  What could it be?
&gt; Throw out bearing?  Loose pressure plate bolt?  Thanks for your time.  Joel
