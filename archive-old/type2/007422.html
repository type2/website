Subject: FS/Trade: 1984 Westy (for a Nice 1970s Model)
To: vanagon_at_VANAGON.COM, type2_at_type2_dot_com

After nearly 20 years of camping in friends' busses, I bought a really
nice Vanagon Westy this summer.  I LOVE the a/c, REAL heater, and
relatively smooth and powerful ride, but something is missing... (early
warning for impending midlife crisis?)  I know, I know...riding around in
a smelly, slow, funny-looking VW camper won't recapture my youth, but
nonetheless...

As my question (Bus or Vanagon?) to the listees here has suggested, I'm
comtemplating the idea of trading my 1984 Westy for a 1970s era Bus Camper.

So here's what I've got:
------------------------
1984 GL Wolfsberg Westfalia. A/C, Blaupunkt stereo, rear heater.  Good
condition overall, runs GREAT, everything works EXCEPT the 'frig does not
work on propane (works wonderfully on electricity, however).  40k miles
on new heads, 10k miles on 100% new cooling system, 5k on new tires. 
This vehicle has been very well maintained, and was recently given a
clean bill of health by my local VW expert.  I paid $6,000 exactly for
it, and I have another $2,000+/- in receipts (shocks, brakes, canvas,
curtains...) from my current efforts to bring it up to excellent
condition.  Of course, I have the previous owner's receipts for the major
work ($4,000+) I've mentioned, too.

The &quot;book&quot; value of my '84 is $6,800, and I suspect that I could probably
sell it for somewhere around this price (in the spring or summer).  I'm
willing to take a '70-something camper as complete trade, if it has been
restored or is in excellent+ condition.

Anyway, if you've got a nice 1970s Westy, live out West, and are
considering buying a Vanagon style camper, let's chat.
