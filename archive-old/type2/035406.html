&gt; &gt; im not sure about using &quot;the pink stuff&quot;....id be afraid of moisture
getting
&gt; &gt; in between the sheet metal and the insulation and rusting (the way
carpet
&gt; &gt; can do to floor pans)
&gt;
&gt; I think when I redo my 68 interior I will insulate with regular R6 or so
&gt; but I plan on sealinf th einsulation in plastic bags. Ive seen it done
&gt; this way in studios it also helps keep the glass fibers from getting loose
&gt; on yyyou  (itch)

The PO of my 67 Standard stuffed fiberglas insulation in every nook and
cranny. It is a sponge! I am replacing both front doors and both cargo doors
because the bottoms are rusted out from this stuff. DO NOT USE IT! Unless
you can vacuum seal the plastic bags....
