Subject: Re: [T2] Volkswagen REgistration Number

On my '72 the VIN is on the dash, the door, behind one of the front seats, and in the engine compartment.

What year is yours?

&gt; Hi All: 
&gt; I am in the process of changing my registration/title back to California 
&gt; from Pennsylvania. The problem I ran into was that DMV wanted to identify 
&gt; the VIN No in two locations. The one at the windshield was readable since 
&gt; it is pressed into metal The decal label don the drivers side door entrance 
&gt; is damaged so you cannot read all the numbers. 
&gt; 
&gt; DMV said I had to make an appointment with the CA Highway Patrol since there 
&gt; are hidden location they know about in the event a vehicle is stolen. I was 
&gt; given a temporary permit for thirty days. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do any of you know where these numbers are placed on the vehicles. I have 
&gt; the VW mechanics manual but it only identifies the windshield VIN location 
&gt; and the engine id number location. 
&gt; 
&gt; I called the HIghway Patrol (I'm in Dublin/Livemore area) and they will not 
&gt; see me the same day. 
&gt; 
&gt; The DMV said if I found someone who knew where to look, they would accept 
&gt; that and do it themselves but they do not have the info themselves. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, 
&gt; Janyce Bartlett
