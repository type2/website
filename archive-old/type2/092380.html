Subject: bus, not an ice-box!


Hiya everyone - I am a bit new to this list...

My problem is (I think) quite common: I have a '76 bus which has a
malfunctioning heating system, it flows gas exhaust into the cab. In Italy
we lack of information on good mechanics who can help me fix it - I don't
know what to do and winter is freezing up here in Milan. 

I could try something myself but have poor information on how the system
works and getting parts often means buying abroad at great cost.
Also, my fair knowledge of specific english terms is not helping much
searching list archives... 

But I have a lot of enthousiasm! Is there anyone willing to help me?

Andy
