Subject: more on SIR

Greetings All,

A few weeks a ago I announced that I was quite pleased with SIR.  Please
allow me to retract that.  If you will recall, allong with a 40 hp engine
kit, they sent a &quot;rebuilt&quot; oil cooler that was both filthy inside and the
wrong type.  What I never posted was that they also sent the wrong
crankshaft (69mm).  When I called them, they promised to make everything
right at their expense.  Nothing happened. Called again.  &quot;Working on it
we'll only charge shipping.&quot;  Nothing happens.  Called again.  &quot;Package has
been sent. Only charged $22 plus shipping. here is the tracking number&quot; 
Package had indeed been sent--via UPS ground.  Unfortunately, UPS doesn't
ship ground to Alaska, only 2nd day air.  The package was returned to SIR
who in turn resent it 2nd day air.  It arrived today and after paying
$79.50 COD I opened it.  Wonderful, ANOTHER 1600 crank and ANOTHER dirty
oil cooler.

With the exception of the oil coolers, the parts have all been first
rate--right on specs.  And I will eventually need these two 69 mm cranks. 
But what I really need are the parts I paid for!  Is that unreasonable?

- -Tom
