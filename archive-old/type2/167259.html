Subject: Re: [T2] F.I. low idling

Hi Chris,

You're saying it starts, but won't idle. Will it keep running if you  
give it more throttle?

If not,  are you sure the fuel pump is getting power when the key is  
on and the flap in the AFM is depressed? If not, the problem is in  
the AFM switch or the double relay.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; **thanks Don, verified that there are ZERO vaccum leaks.  All new  
&gt; gaskets and seals.  It dies before the AAR closes.  Anything else?  
&gt; It's not engine (longblock) or intake.  It's gotta be ignition or  
&gt; exhaust but I can't find the problem.
