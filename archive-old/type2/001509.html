Subject: water on the floor question
Date: Sat, 6 Jan 2001 17:05:49 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi List, The snow has finally melted here in Oklahoma and the other day I
went to the bus to start her up when I noticed a small puddle of water on
both sides of the front floor under my rubber matts. I had noticed this when
I bought the bus, but I painted a rubber based paint on the floor and
thought I had no  more problems. Well on the drivers side it all bubbled up
and surface rust has now shown its ugly face. I talked with a friend here in
OKC and he says its comming from the windsheild gasket. But I cant see where
it actually leaks from. No wetness on the dash, nothing coming from the
front walls as far as I can tell. Anyone else with ideas? Also I was
wondering if there are seals for the accelerator rod going thru the floor
and the E-brake handle as mine does not have any. Could this be the
culprit?Anyone heading to BBB? I'd like to go this year.
