Subject: Brake questions

Hi All,
I have a '77 bus with a '73 1700 running a weber carb.
The PO apparently despised power-assisted brakes because there
are no vacum lines going to the servo. I wasn't even aware that this 
bus HAD power brakes until I was creeping around under the front
and spotted the booster servo. I can connect it up to manifold
vacum okay, but here is the question: There appear to be 2 fittings
on the booster servo. Do I hook up one or both. If one which one?
Also, is there a provision to protect the system from a backfire?
As a side note, this bus also had air conditioning. Eveything
appears to be there except the compressor. If any one needs A/C parts
for their bus, I will be happy to sell what I have as I have no plans on
running A/C even here in Phoenix. If you're interested, let me know
what parts you need and I'll see if they are there.
Thanks and Happy Friday,
Jeff and The Frijole Grande
