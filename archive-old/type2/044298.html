&gt; Has anybody heard of 'electric in-line heaters' for buses?  I have a 77 westy that I am thinking of cutting out those useless rusted heater boxes, and would like to replace with a 'engine to muffler' combo.  Has anyone heard of such a thing?
&gt; 
&gt; A friend showed me the electric heaters in a catalog about a year ago, but neither one of us can find that catalog now.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
