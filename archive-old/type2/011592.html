&gt;I want to do a ground up restoration but don't know where to start. 
&gt;Does anyone know of a Car Restoration for Dummies type book or any 
book 
&gt;that would be helpful to the novice. 
&gt; 
&gt;BTW I already have the hayes, chiltons, bently and keep to vw alive 
books. 
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks

One book I have that I find useful is : &quot;VW Beetle and Transporter purchase 
and  restoration guide&quot; by Lindsay Porter, published by Haynes. 327 pages 
with photos  concerning Beetle and bus restoration. Bought mine from 
Amazon_dot_com. 

Hope this help
