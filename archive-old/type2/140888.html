Subject: Re: [T2] PayPal Flagged Account

All of my own lists are set to moderate new subcribers.  GIves me a chance
to block spammers before thier trash makes it to the list members.  Speaking
of which, I need to go over to Yahoo and block another one...

Bus Content:

I had the rear tires replaced to match the shiny new ones on the front.
Didn't have the books with me (my bad) and they torqued the lug nuts to 80
lb.  The book says 71 lb.

Should I retorque to the book, or leave them as is for now?
