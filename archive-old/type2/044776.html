Subject: [T2] Horn &amp; rev lights not working

Hi Volks,

Spent some time in and around the bus today.  Finally got all the  lights to work except the backup lights.  Bulbs and connections were 
cleaned, but still no go.  My only other thought is the switch.  Does
the tranny need gear oil in it to get the switch to work?  I drained 
it a few months ago and haven't replaced it yet.

My horn doesn't seem to want to work either.  Again, the connections 
have been cleaned and/or replaced.  Anyway to check the horn unit with 
an ohm meter?  The local FLAPS lets me use theirs.  Just for kicks I 
tried to pry up the horn button...thought I was going to break
something.  It didn't want to budge.  Does anybody have a secret tool
or tip they could enlighten me with??

I noticed some play in the input shaft like the seal is worn.  Not much,
maybe 1/32 between the metal and the seal.  Replace or normal?

One more thing,  I know this was bought up several months ago but I 
just experienced some bad CV boots.  I bought mine from RMMW about
ten months ago and put them on three or four months ago.  Just today
I noticed a whole lot of surface cracking like the rubber has been 
stretched. :(  These boots haven't even been driven on yet!!!
I'd be madder if the joints had been new also.  They were German boots
and I remember someone saying that they had good luck with an 
American brand.  Anyone remember the name?

Things are moving right along  :)
