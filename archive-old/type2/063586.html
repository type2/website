Subject: Cleaning fiberglass poptop

Juli Martin sez:

I am sure those of you out there in VW land have tackled the problem
of a nasty, grimy, mildewy, moss-covered poptop before.  I just spent
2 hours up there on mine (I'm glad I'm in Georgia where it ain't cold yet)
scrubbing with ENTNT (degreaser/cleaner) and bathroom foam spray.
I KNOW that I shouldn't go about sloshing bleach up there, but at this
point I am tempted to.

I don't know why not. I cut the bleach about 1/2 with water and slop it up
there with a mop. Let it sit a few minutes or until it is obvious that it's
done its job and then hose it off and finish washing the car. In our Atlanta
humidity count on doing it every other month or so til cool weather takes
care of the mildew.

Since yours has been neglected you probably ought to pressure wash it to get
the barnacles and heavy grundge off first.
