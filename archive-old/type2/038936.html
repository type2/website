Subject: Safety Systems Wiring Problems

Hello one and all
Let me start with a thanks to the people on the list.  As a reader and new
Type II owner I've picked up a lot of good information.
 I've got a 69 bus with some wiring problems &quot;so what's new&quot; the Emergency
Flasher Relay (9 pin type) is not functioning for turn indicators, brake
lights and emergency flashers.  I would like to keep the 9 pin unit but they
are getting harder to find and somewhat pricey.  If some one has a good
source for after market or good rebuilt that would be great.  I understand
that there is a conversion to the newer 4 pin flasher unit using an updated
9 pin emergency flashers switch does any one have a current flow diagram for
the conversion or can tell me where to get one? The &quot;Dive Barge&quot; my bus was
a rescue from an early trip to the salvage yard a new motor and a brake
rebuild and she is just about road worthy again.  If I can get the safety
system working &quot;a good thing&quot; I will in fact be a happy Type II person.
Thanks for your help.

Paul
