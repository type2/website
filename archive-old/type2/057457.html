&gt;    Probably a good reason to go to a bigger, external oil cooler as
&gt;well. With it's own electric fan. And, if you did it right (meaning
&gt;using hydraulic hose with real fittings rather than the hose clamp model
&gt;so it wouldn't leak) and placed it right or ducted it right, it could be
&gt;a wonderful heat source.

It's on my list of things to do.  I don't think it has much potential as a
heat source, though.  The only time I would need the heat (winter) is the
time I would not want to be pulling much heat out of the oil.  Routing the
heat to the front of the bus would also be a problem.

&gt;    The more I look at that flap setup, the less I like it. Not the
&gt;warming up part, but it sure looks like it would have one side running
&gt;hotter or colder than the other most of the time.

If you look closely I think you will find that the drivers side opening is
larger than the passenger side, so that when the flap is open the area
taken up by the oil cooler ducting makes the two sides about equal.

&gt; And you'd
&gt;certainly get better oil cooling with the stock cooler by removing that
&gt;flap

I'm not so sure.  My reasoning is that the air is not going to make the
sharp bend to go through the cooler - it will have a tendancy to ram right
over it to the cylinder fins.  Air has mass and it likes to go straight,
just like anything else.
