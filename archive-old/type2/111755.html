They
aren't making good heat exchangers any more and they
will become even 
more
scarce with time.

I have learned quite a while ago, regardless of the

My experience was, ahh i'll just get a new one, come
to find out they dont even make a good reproduction of
what i tossed out.. this was out of my early'63 T3..

live and learn,
