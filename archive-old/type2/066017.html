Sorry 'bout the '47 -- it's not in the paper today in the antiques and
classic section.  If anybody has a Monday paper, maybe you could check for
me.

At any rate here is the list for today.  The San Jose Mercury News has its
classified's (and other stuff) on-line at http://spyglass.sjmercury_dot_com.  I
took this bit from their html (sorry sjm) straight.  Area code is 408.
