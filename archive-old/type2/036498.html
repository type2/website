&gt; Greetings all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking at having a stereo system installed in my '74 Westy.
&gt;
&gt; There doesn't seem to be much to support the radio inside the dash.  I'm
&gt; almost positive that I'll be putting some 6x9's under the couch, but not
&gt; sure of where to put speakers in the front.

Well, I bought a Blaupunkt in-dash cd with AM\FM.  It fit nicely, after I cut
out about a 1/4 on each side.  It is flush with the front of the dash, and I
used none of the mounting hardware.  I think the heater controls help hold it
up, but it's mostly held in by the dash itself.  (I am also incredibly
intrigued by the glove box mount seen in magazines.  The only problem is that i
don't know if I want to take my G.B. door off)

    My speakers were set right on top of the dash for ease of installation, but
I'll be moving them this year.  People say to put them in the door, but I don't
really like that.  It's wet in my doors because I need window seals.  I'm
thinking I'll build small boxes to put them under the dash near the headlight
buckets.  My speakers (6&quot; round) are also Blaupunct.

    Rear speakers are another story.  I don't want to install them anywhere,
because I'd have to cut my panels, and I'd lose my wonderful westy storage
space.  I wonder about mounting them in the top, maybe with hinges so they
would flip up when the top was up, and attach to the front cross bar, on either
side of the canvas window.  I don't know.

    What have other people done with westy sound?
