A few months ago in VW Trends, there was outstanding picture of a 60 crew
cab. I took very much notice as to the step or running board on one side of
the vehicle. I talked with the previous owner who sold the crew cab to the
gentleman that had it in the magazine.  They don't know where they got it
from. As anyone any information on a side step or running board for the
passenger side of a 79 Loaf.
