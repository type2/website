well, check the fuel lines, try to find the leak, and then, replace them. The fuel line comes out of the tank above the tranny, a little in front of the starter, i think (im recalling this from memorie, might not be right)There might be more then one line if your bus is Fuel injected. (not sure just assumeing, dont own a FI bus)Dont drive your bus with a fuel leak. What year is it? is it your daily driver? Can you afford for it to be off the road a day or two?
