Subject: Re: BA4/BA6 gas heaters  (longish)

&gt;The Propex heater sounds like a very nice unit, and certainly has its 
&gt;advantages.  But for those who can't afford $600, don't dispair - a cold 
&gt;winter in the bus may yet be averted if you can find a good used gas 
&gt;heater.  Before spending a fortune, try the local junkyards; sometimes you 
&gt;luck into a nice Vanagon BA6 for $25 or $50 if they don't know what it's 
&gt;worth.  And then allow yourself a good weekend's worth of work to put it in 
&gt;and get it working right.  But considering the alternatives - $600 poorer 
&gt;or cold as heck- a hundred bucks and a weekend's time ain't too bad.

DOOD! Where were these cheap gas heaters when I was looking for mine? I 
spent $600 bucks on my Stewart-Warner! (I don't even know what a BA5 is 
- - it might be completely different from mine - which is 20,000 Btu) I'm 
not sure - but Ol JB gets $600 + for his. And as far as I'm concerned 
it was worth EVERY penny!!!
