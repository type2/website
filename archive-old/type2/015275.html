archives are down....
i had a few questions about installing these.
1) what gauge wire to run to the dash? 18? 16?

2) is there a gasket/seal on the sump plate where the temp sender goes?
where the plate mates with the case, not the sender with the plate.

3) couldnt find a torque spec. for those two screws on the sump plate?
i know the nut for the strainer is one that you do NOT want to overtorque.

4) oilpressure sender, what type sealant to use?
i know it needs to ground....

any help is appreciated!
thanks-
Rob
