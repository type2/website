Subject: Re: [T2] Finally got my bus home

Hiya Phil,

As others have mentioned replace the rubber fuel lines.  ALL of them.  
Wherever they may be.  Use only VW braided fuel line.  Completely redo the 
brake system from the master cylinder reservior on out to the linings.  ALL 
new or in like-new shape.  Once you have these two jobs done you can be sure 
you can get the beast started without burning it to a crisp.  And you can get 
it stopped without running into a wall.

Another word of advice........ I noticed you have a copy of Muir's Idiot 
Book.  Great reading, but not the best shop manual by a long shot.  If you do 
not have it already, get yourself a copy of Bentley's Official VW Service 
Manual (look for the green cover).  It will guide you through practically all 
you'll need to do in the upcoming months.

Finally, you might want to consider losing the VW roundels on your website.  
VWoA has been.........um.........well, shall we say they've had a rather 
narrow and restrictive interpretation on how their corporate identity has 
been used.  Yes, even to the point of closing down websites and court action.
