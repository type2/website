For the bulk of my cooking I use a single burner Coleman that just 
threads down on to one of those small propane bottles.
I pretty much always carry 2 propane bottles with me, just to make sure 
I don't run out, and also to have a replacement bottle for those bad 
ones that occasionally have leaky valves and do not re-seal when the 
stove is unscrewed from the bottle.
In travelling in hotter than hammered Hell temperatures, I have never 
had a problem.
By hot, I mean so hot that the thermometer red dye went all the way up 
to the top of the scale.
By hot, I mean where the thermometer glue melted and the thermometer 
fell off the scaled graduations.
By hot, I mean where I laid up in the top bunk with my arms extended 
into the air like a vulture does when he wants to stay cool.
