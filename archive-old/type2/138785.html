Subject: Re: [T2] 1980 Vanagon air seal

Hello Christophe,
2&quot; is closer to 5cm. 7cm is about 2 1/2&quot; I think. You mentioned that you are
looking for a wire harness for fuel injection I believe. (Can't seem to find
your last post) I have a few of the harness parts left from repairing my
harness. What parts do you need, I may be able to help you out.
