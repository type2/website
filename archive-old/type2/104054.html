Subject: Notes on painting a poptop

I just finished painting my 77 fiberglass poptop.  It came out great.  I 
thought I'd share some tips with everyone.  My top was very moldy and had 
some areas where the fibers were coming through.

To get the mold off, I first scrubbed the top thoroughly with Ajax bleach 
cleanser.  Then I sanded it down with course sanding sponges.  Be sure to 
wear a mask when doing this.  If you've never used sanding sponges, they work 
ten times better than sandpaper.  Then I gave it another final scrub with 
more Ajax.

The primer and paint I used are both Interlux products that are made for 
fiberglass boats.  They worked great, but are a little pricey.  One quart of 
primer and one quart of paint will cover a top perfectly.  These paints are 
very toxic so don't even think of using these paints without a good charcoal 
filter respirator mask.  I used a small sponge roller (get lots of refills) 
and a brush to &quot;roll and tip&quot; the paint on.  The roller goes on so good you 
can almost forget the brush.

The primer is called Pre-Kote.  It has lots of filler so it goes on thick and 
will cover any loose fibers that hang out.  I sanded the primer layer and 
then spot primed some thin spots.

The paint is called Toplac.  It's their newest and best one part 
polyurethane.  At $40 a quart, it should be good.  It won a durability 
contest performed by a boating magazine.  It's much better than any one part 
polyurethane I've used before.  Almost as good as the two part paints and 
less toxic.  With one quart, I put on two layers.  Be sure to sand in between 
layers.

The finish is so hard I can barely make a mark in it.  Bugs just wipe off.  
The paint is very white and very glossy.  It doesn't match the original 
finish, but I think it looks great.  It's certainly easier to clean.
