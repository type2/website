&gt; 
&gt; I have my own dormobile question:  did they make breadloaf/baywindow/lagwagon
&gt; dormobiles? 

Well I don't claim to be the world authority on dorm's but yes I know for a fact 
that they did indeed make dorm roof's for baywindows. I have personally never 
seen a dorm roof on anything newer than a 1979 VW but Dorm rooves are actually 
more common in Europe where they are outfitted on more than VW's


 I saw a lagwagon/baywindow/breadloaf with the distinct doormobile
&gt; top coming home from party last saturday, where I'd met a really nice red-head
&gt; girl, 5' 11&quot;, just took the the bar... but thats another story...

un hunh :)


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It definitely looked like a doormobile: car the windows in the top, the 
&gt; right shape to the top, not like a normal westy with windows cut in it...

what normal &quot;westy with windows&quot; are you referring to? the ventilation window on 
top of the v'gon westy roof?

what do you consider to be a lagwagon?
