Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat

I'd go with the bar and chain oil. I do mine twice a year ( spring &amp; fall )
soak it, anywhere you can get it, inside the frame rails especially. It's
been 3 years and the rust has not progressed. Tar ( Kool Patch ) scares me
'cause you can't see what's going on underneath the stuff!

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I know this topic has gone around and around but I'd like to take it up
once
&gt; more. The archives weren't that helpful.
&gt; I've got a '71 that's still pretty solid but the &quot;undercoating&quot; that looks
&gt; original is almost like a thick paint that comes off in big flakes. I've
&gt; spend some time under there the last few weeks and I'm seriously
considering
&gt; some kind of treatment. After removing the remaining  loose undercoating
&gt; I'll put something better on.
&gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate opinions on the best way to do this. I've heard that Waxoyl
&gt; is very good but then I've also heard that Agway or Husquarvarna bar oil
&gt; works well
