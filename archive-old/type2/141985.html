Subject: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Forget the TV shop dudes... Before you pay an electronics tech to fix that 
multimeter, check the discount tool places like Horrible Freight 
(harborfreight_dot_com).... you should find digital multimeters for under ten 
bucks.  Some of the simpler ones go for two or three dollars when on promotion!

I hate the thought of sending more stuff to the landfill... I've got a coupla 
busted Simpson 260s waiting for a cold winter day when the mood for an indoor 
project strikes me.  At the prices of functional approximations, above, the 
Simpsons may wait quite a while ;-))

my multi meter broke also while back and after buying a new one it was 
suggested that i take my old one to a tv repair shop that they might be able to 
help me get my old one fixed as well..
maybe check with a tv repair shop first even though there was smoke involved...
 
i bought my multi meter at autozone after a extensive search from a wide 
distance they were the only ones to carry one..
i think i paid like 30 bucks for it..?
