Another alternative would be to atatch an electronic bleeper (about $5 I
expect  from Radio Shack) accross the supply wire to the lights and a
suitable earth.  This could be mounted behind the rear bumper.  The wiring
is much shorter.   It would bleep when you reverse, which is good for
animals and small children - not so goo for other folks camping at night
though!
