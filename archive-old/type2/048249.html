Subject: RE: [T2] ignition

Jamie, Tim, and Phil, 
Thanks for your very helpful replies! It looks like the mystery is resolved.


Remember that I when I first tried to troubleshoot the ignition and still
had the Pertronix module, I did get spark from the coil's terminal #4
(though not from any sparkplug wire end). Well, I thought, if there's spark
at all, then the Pertronix trigger module should be fine and the fault
should either be with the cap or with the rotor. To my surprise, replacing
those didn't help. I thus proceeded to replace the Pertronix with standard
points and condenser, not because it made sense to me, but because I had run
out of other ideas and didn't have anything better to do. Since that somehow
expectedly didn't resolve the problem either, I was reinforced in my belief
that the problem had nothing to do with points or Pertronix. I theorized
that the coil was bad, that the spark was so weak, it couldn't make it
through cap and rotor. Changed the coil, still saw no improvement, and
decided to e-mail the list.

Well, your e-mails all persuaded me to check and clean the points, and
whaddya know, the engine came to life. Still, I was confused and unsure
about the original source of the problem, since the Pertronix, too, had
seemed functional. I checked it out more closely, and found that although
the insulation was intact, one of module's wires was ruptured at the base.
And so it was at random sometimes connected and sometimes disconnected,
misleading the diagnostic.

Sami
