Subject: bought 2 VW ads...

Hey all,
Saturday I was in Harrisonburg VA and at the mall there is a store
called Shenandoah Graphics and they had, among a BUNCH of other cool
stuff, lots of VW print ads from the '60s, these are the actual ads
taken out of magazines.  One of mine is from Look magazine 12/12/67 but
the other doesn't say.  I bought two, the single-page ads are $5 each
and the two-page ads are $7 each. Framed 'em, they look nice.  They fit
an 11x14 frame pretty well.

I got one for a bus and one for a Beetle.

The Bus one is the one from Look magazine, and is an ad for the ALL NEW
'68 Bus.  The photo shows a '68 Bus right side view with the sliding
door, passenger door, and rear hatch open.  The view lets you see inside
all the space.  (I wish my bus was that nice)  Text:

                           Open wide and say ah.

Surprise.
You thought you were going to see a roomy, homely Volkswagen station
wagon.
But it's a new kind of roomy, homely Volkswagen station wagon.
To begin with, getting in is easier:  the front doors are lower and
wider.  And with the side door we've achieved a milestone in station
wagon doordom.  It slides.
Once inside, you might even think you're in a normal car.  Everything's
padded.  Including the dashboard, visors, and the armrests.  (Besides
looking like a car, we've improved the suspension so it even rides like
a car.)
There are bucket seats up front.  And where most cars have something
called a console, the new box has an aisle.  (If the mood should strike
you, you can walk the length of the box.)
So when you look inside the new box expect to be pleasantly surprised.
But not overwhelmed.
Because as boxes go, our station wagon is now pretty fancy.  
But as station wagons go, it's still a box.

The Beetle one is tough to tell the year.  The ad is black and white and
looks like early to mid-60's.  Ad presents a left side view of a Beetle.

                        Presenting America's slowest fastback.

There are some new cars around with very streamlined roofs.
But they are not Volkswagens.
They are called fastbacks, and some of them are named after fish.
You can tell them from Volkswagens because a VW won't go over 72 mph.
(Even though the speedometer shows a wildly optimistic top speed of 90.)
So you can easily break almost any speed law in the country in a VW.
And you can also cruise right past gas stations, repair shops and tire
stores.
The VW engine may not be the fastest, but it's among the most advanced.
It's made of magnesium alloy (one step better than aluminum).  And it's
so well machined you may never add oil between changes.
The VW engine is cooled by air, so it can never freeze up or boil over.
It won't have anything to do with water.
So we saw no reason to name it after a fish.


I love these old VW ads.  I'm gonna have to get some more... :)
