&gt; The mugs do seem quite benign because they are so cartoonish and

&gt; mugs, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act works against him, and there
&gt; just isn't any fair use provision or First Amendment protection for this

Well, since the art is a custom depiction of an actual object (bus) that
contains the logos involved, it should be considered a work of art.  After
all, if a newspaper prints a picture of a VW that happens to contain
their circle trademark they don't threaten to sue the newspaper.

OTOH, the web page itself has many references to VWs.  It would be better
to get rid of those references and expand the concept to custom depictions
of any vehicle on a mug.

Since VW is trying to market a new microbus, I wonder if they have
trademarked the &quot;double-curve&quot; front of the splitty bus.  Jeep trademarked
their 7-slot grille in a similar way, though I notice that the Hummer H2
pushes the limit on that account.  It might well become legally dangerous
to take a photograph of any bus.

&gt; If the artwork on the mugs were obviously a parody or satire of some
&gt; sort he might be able to skate, and some of this artwork might be
&gt; regarded as a parody by a court. If he has the money to defend himself.
&gt; He probably doesn't.

Problem is, the cost of defense would break any ordinary individual.
That's the real crime here.  VW will squash anyone whether they are right
or wrong.  &quot;Might Makes Right&quot; works, but is bad PR.

&gt; The bottom line seems to be that VW is sending a message, they have been
&gt; sending the same message for at least three years, they are sending it
&gt; very forcefully and consistently, and they probably don't intend to stop
&gt; sending it: don't use their trademarks at all or they are going to find
&gt; you and hurt you. I don't *like* that, but it's pretty hard to deny
&gt; given all the evidence we have.

Absolutely true, and VW is creating a lot of hatred out there.  The loss
of sales from aircooled folks is probably minor (my wife was hot for a VR6
Golf, but decided to wait for the Honda Element due to VW's cavalier
attitude) but word of mouth does the job.
