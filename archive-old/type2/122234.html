Subject: RE: [T2] battery terminal

&quot;Where is the positive - red - plus battery post in your bay window
VW.?&quot;

It depends on the year.  My '70 has the ground strap attatched to the body 
right below the passenger taillight.  The positive cable attatches to the 
starter, and passes through the firewall to reach it.

Eron
