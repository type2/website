Subject: stuck valve

We have a winner I think, thanks to Mark in Portland for this gem.  It seems
the most likely culprit:

&gt;Type one heads lead a tough life in a bus, even tougher when the engine has
been modified.
&gt;Its possible a valve seat popped out of the head and is loose under the
valve.

Due to the unknowns on the HI-PO hogged out P n' P 041 heads I bought off
thesamba, I would say, know your head rebuilder!  All the guides were new
and tight, valves and seats new, ground well and sealed perfectly.  However,
he could have got the fit wrong on the seats (supposed to be interference
eh?).  And now thats the 2nd set of heads bought over the internet that
turned out to be junk.  Get what you pay for I guess, but it wasn't exactly
cheap BTW.

&quot;Luckily&quot; the pushrod jumped out of the rocker so it doesn't seemed to have
constantly hammered itself.  We shall see when it comes apart.

I set the CR right and have a head temp gauge, it was not running hot (at
least on the other side).

Thanks also to GGM, Access Bob, Dave Bolen, and Jamie Auch (my next engine
will be a stroker like that!). welcome any and all additional input, pmail
OK too.
