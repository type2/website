X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

i had similar problem last month, after replacing calipers, discovered that 
problem was in hose. if cracking the bleed screw lets the pads retract, 
suspect hoses.
having a limited tool supply,i took the easy way, BENDIX remanufactured 
LOADED calipers,$46.82 ea, $22.50 core, from Smothers Parts International.
you probably want to do the wheel bearings while your at it.

best wishes
