Subject: RE: [T2] rear vent window info needed

Where do most people get replacement windows for the rear sides from? Do I
need to find a donor or can I get one cut or does someone online sell
windows?

No.  Well, OK, we probably have some buses on the list where it does not
leak, but it is a very leak-prone area.

&gt; Can I just buy another piece of glass that is the
&gt; full length and install it in place of the vent? Will glass from the other
&gt; side work?

Yes and yes.  What you propose is the usual solution.  Be ready to deal
with a substantial amount of rust when you pop that window out.
