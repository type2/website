Subject: stuff on CD's?

First off.. Doc Tim.. the next time I make it up to
the islands I owe you lunch with your favorite micro.
;-)

second--
A while ago there was some talk about manuals and
microfich on CD. The microfich was apparently of all
air cooled parts with some diagrams. The manuals on
CD are available thru Bently I believe. Where was the
microfich available from and has anyone bought and
used
the either? If so what do you think an where did you
get
them from?

TIA
