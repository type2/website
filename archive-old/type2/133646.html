Subject: Re: Pacific Northwest Salvage Yards

I have found that every Pick-n-Pull in the Bay Area most always has at
least 1 bay window every time I go. But I have never seen an SC or DC in a
wrecking yard. And narrowing down your search to a '72 is bound to be a
frustrating experience.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of any VW salvage yards in the pacific northwest that may
&gt; &gt; have a good selection of baywindow project vans? I am looking for a 72 SC
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; DC, which seems harder to find than a split window bug.
&gt;
&gt; I have seen very few yards that have buses in them period. I encountered one
 camper at Dorris Auto in Hayward some months ago, but that seems to have
 been a total fluke. I've been to that yard a bunch, and older VWs seem rare
 there. Still, they have the advantage of being the only yard in the Bay Area
 I have yet found to keep a running inventory of vehicles in their yard. In
 other words, you can call and ask them if they have what you want, and they
 will actually tell you if they have it.

 A little goldmine I hit upon recently was the Pic 'n Pull in Newark. There
 were buses and campers o'plenty, though most were pretty picked over. But
 still, there were so many that I have to believe that it wasn't a
 coincidence. I mean, all these other yards have nothing and this one had
 about a dozen. To me, it seems like their inventory buyer is someone who
 understands the value of them, and that most other buyers don't get it. The
 down-side to this place is that, like almost all the others, they won't tell
 you what they have in stock.

 One quick tip is that most yards in the Sacramento area, the last time I
 checked (though it has been some years), will tell you what they have if you
 call.
