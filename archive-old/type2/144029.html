Subject: messed up brakes when fixing idle?

Attempting to fix an idle problem on my 71 camper
(1600 DP), I took a look at the hoses going from the
engine to the brake power assist. Old and creepy, so I
pulled them off. Not knowing any better, I went to
AutoZone and got similarly sized hose. Fixed the idle
problem, but soon after I noticed that the bus seemed
to run as if the parking brakes were on, even though
they weren't. When I jacked the car up and tried to
turn the front wheels by hand, they turned hard. As a
side note, I've lost small amounts of brake fluid, but
haven't been able to find any leaks around the wheels.
A more knowledgeable family member suggested that the
brake trouble might be caused by a faulty master
cylinder. He suggested that I remove and inspect it.  
I started to remove the master cylinder (which is
mostly a clot of rust) and managed to get one nut off.
The other one, sad to say, is stuck to the bolt, which
seems to have broken loose inside the power booster
despite generous, repeated applications of penetrating
oil. Both nut and bolt spin when turned. I'm wondering
now (now that I've got a busted up, expensive part)
whether the sticky brakes might have been caused by
the B-grade hose I used. If the hose collapses under
vacuum, would that engage the brakes? If so, and if I
replace the hose with the proper type, is there any
alternative to replacing the booster with its
currently messed-up bolt?
