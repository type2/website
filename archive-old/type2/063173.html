&lt;&lt; My bodyman called today and was exasperated about not
 finding the paint code for my van. He claims it's no where to be found. I
 don't have the time to look for myself. My question is -is it on the vin
 plate behind the front seat? The plate reads as follows.... &gt;&gt;

The paint code on a pre 68' type 2 is usually on a silver sticker on the wall
behind the passenger seat.  What year and (generic - blue, green, etc) color
is your bus?
