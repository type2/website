Subject: lug nut torque specs

Hi Listees,
I've been off the list loop for a very long time now due to computer 
fiascos, technical problems and family issues.

I have a quick question concerning torque specs for the 14 inch, late 
split/early bay bus wheels.  I need to take my wheels off and 2 of them are 
way too tight due to over zealous air wrenches.  What is the correct torque 
for these nuts?  I don't want this to happen again.

Thanks a bunch.
