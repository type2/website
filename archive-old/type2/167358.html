Subject: Re: Sliding door track lube question

&gt;&gt; the sliding door works great but I did noticed after cleaning on the dust 
&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt; of the track there was no lube at all. Should this be lubed? Ratwell 
&gt;&gt; mentions
&gt;&gt; lubing the track in his article but the door slides so easy...
 

&lt;sigh&gt;, I guess this is one of my pet peeeves... as in garage door tracks,, 
and sliding door tracks, NEVER EVER EVER lube the track... 

well... I might say ok ,, it is your track,, but don't use anything like 
GREASE! ,,, dry graph.. or some other new product I am unaware of probably 
works perfect.... go ahead,, make your self happy... 

ME.... I lube the bearings in the wheel that rides the track... 

I think lubing the track is akin to putting ice on the roads so your car 
tires go down the road easier..... 

grease attracts dust and road dirt... within no time you have grunge that 
makes it difficult to slide the door. 

and especially in cold weather,, the grease is stiff. the wheels don't move 
properly,, 

Trains don't grease the tracks.... they lube the wheel bearings.
