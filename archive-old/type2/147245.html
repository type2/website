Subject: Re: [T2] FI bus Cranks too long after days of sitting

&gt; Nyssa drove home (800mi) and parked her bus here a few days, and when

&gt; 7 sec),

Could it be the thermo-time switch or cold-start valve?  What year bus? 
Is it your 78 Westy FI?  It sounds exactly like what I was experiencing 
when my thermo-time switch was unplugged which prevented the cold-start 
valve from operating.
