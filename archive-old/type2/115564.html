Subject: Trying to identify a part in engine

Can anyone tell me what this part is? It's a 2 inch long round gizmo that is
sitting on top of the engine. It's electrical wire runs behind the engine wall
towards the front. The gizmo has a rubber plug and when pulled off there are
three metal prongs inside. I can't seem to find any pictures of it in any of
my manuals.
