Hi Jeff and Volks

A few words on Jeff's questions

Rust spots
- Depending on what part of the country you live in
  the rust spots that are showing up may be coming
  from pinholes through to the backside. This would be bad news
  as panel replacements would be in order...

Epoxy Primer
- The two part epoxy primers are excellent
- They also require a special gun
  Primer gun up here is about $150 US
- The finish coat gun is close to $600 US
- I am sure cheaper guns can be had, ...
  but I like the German ones...
- Epoxy paint is carcinogenic. In other
  words you need breathing protection if
  you want to paint more than one bus...

Remember as soon as spring comes to the
rust belt, it's time for a good pressure wash, dry,
and more bar oil for undercoat.

My 2 cents,
Regards,
Don Martin, Fairfield Vermont
