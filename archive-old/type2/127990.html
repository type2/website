&gt; Maybe I am wondering exactly what the final drive gear ratio

&gt; So, I jack the bus up, put it in 4th gear, mark a tire, chock the other

&gt; *one* rpm in order to see how many revolutions the tire turned at 1 rpm
&gt; so I can apply the math and know what the final drive ratio is..
&gt; 
&gt; *what* is one rpm for the purpose of this test?????

Dave you already got the answer, but wait a minute. I'm not 100% sure,
but quite confident about this one. If you block one of the wheels and
measure how many turns one of the wheels moves you will not be able to
calculate the final drive. why? the fact there is a differential in
the center of the transaxle.

In a nutshell if both wheels are turning the same speed the spider
gears inside are only transfering power to the wheels, and not trying
to compensate for the different turning radius of the rear tires (such
as making a left turn). But if you block one of the wheels. the spider
gears are turning and in turn actually multiplying (or dividing, i'm
not sure which) the speed in which the tire turns. I suspect that this
is why you posed the question anyway, tried it and got a flaky number?
correct?

if this is incorrect, someone please correct me. It's not fun tring to
simulate a differential in my head :)
