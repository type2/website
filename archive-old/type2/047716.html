Subject: [T2] RE: Gas mileage woes...Part 2

Hello again,

 I read, then reread, then reread.... Oops, I see he had a mailer problem !!
Thanks to everyone who responded, it seems to me that no one but me thought
that blow-by would cause my problems. The consensus was that the fuel
pressure regulator could be bad. I don't have a gas pressure tester so I
swapped out the regulator, and lo and behold, the engine seems to be running
allot smoother.

 Just in case some others have more recommendations, here is what I've done
so far:

Checked cold start injector for leaks,
checked all FI for leaks, found one with a bad spray pattern and replaced,
made certain all vacuum lines are sealed,
set timing correctly, (Bill, I found the mark finally!!!)
set idle correctly
replaced Temp II sensor.
checked and replaced bad fuel lines

I'll be able to tell if the regulator was the culprit or not later in the
week.

Thanks again to everyone!!
