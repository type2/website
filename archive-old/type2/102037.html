Subject: Re: [T2] Weber Progressive sucks as the temp drops - and more

&gt; In New England we have to run a thinner oil in the winter as the oil
&gt; pressure when cold can (and did on my 79) cause 20 year oil oil cooler seals
&gt; to leak. I've got a oil pressure guage and even with thin oil (10-40w) the
&gt; oil pressure guage will peg (90lbs plus) on cold winter mornings.

I'm running 10-30w. Unfortuantely, I don't have an oil pressure gauge, so I
can't tell what's up there (it's on the to-do list).

The seals are about one month old with less than 1000 miles on them. I
tore-down the engine over the Xmas holiday (see the thread about the damned
distributor drive spring falling into the engine...).

&gt; Just another thing to check. The oil cooler is above the oilfilter, so it
&gt; sometimes will look like the oilfilter or oil pressure switch (both easy
&gt; fixes) is leaking when it is actually the oil cooler seals that are leaking.

My oil pressure switch was leaking before - this is definitely a different
leak. I replaced the switch during the overhaul.

Thanks for the input though.

-Eric
