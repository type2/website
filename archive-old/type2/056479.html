Hi Lori and the list,

Geez, you should meet and commiserate with my girlfriend, who is an
engineer; mechanics and auto shops get away with patronizing her for
about five minutes, after which they quickly discover that she probably
is more knowledgeable than they are!  After an encounter with her, I
doubt if they are so eager to underestimate the capabilities of women in
the future...

You can install an oil temp. gauge in an easy afternoon; it's one of the
simplest modifications you can make, and is absolutely invaluable to an
air-cooled engine.  But your mechanic was right in one regard: looking
at the temp *will* scare you from time to time!  But better that than a
blown engine... at least you'll know it's hot before it's too late and
damage is done.

If you decide to tackle the installation (and I urge you to do so), I'm
sure you will find ample support from the list -- I and others would be
happy to assist with anything from moral support to detailed
instructions!
