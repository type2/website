Hi list...I am posting this ? for a friend

He is rebuilding his `73 bus motor...I can't recall if it is a 1700 or
1800....anyway, myself being a split kinda guy, I don't have much
experience dealing with these beasts. I recall a problem of dropped
valve seats in the later `72-`79 bus engines.  I don't remember if this
problem was on all type 4 motors, or just the 2000 cc engines.

He wants to get his heads rebuilt and I recall a certain place,
Stephen's maybe??? that had a special rebuilding technique guaranteed to
eliminate this valve seat problem.

Any info if this problem was in all type 4 engines...and if so, any info
on the correct place to have his head work done..Thanks Todd
