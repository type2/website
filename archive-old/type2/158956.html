Subject: Re: [T2] Finally got her running, some engine questions

quoth Tom Young:
The other thing that comes to mind is an over-rich fuel setup which is a 
consistent problem with the older AFM FI rigs.  The spring inside the 
AFM weakens over time leading to an over-rich mixture at all speeds and 
RPMs. This, too, will frequently result in the hesitation you describe....

My original engine is still running (146K)- and yes it does run rich, 
but no hesitation.
This begs the question- a  NEW AFM then should require more push to open 
the AFM flapper than an old worn weaker one- does anyone know what force 
is required in a NEW AFM to push it open?  If this were known, then 
adjusting the spring to proper tension should be possible? Or perhaps a 
compensating resistor could be put in series with the circuit to the ECU?
