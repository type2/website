Subject: Re: Can I repair '82 Vanagon heat exchanger?

I have recently purchased this air cooled wonder and have been trying to salvage the heat 
exchangers. The end of the heat exchanger shroud that fits over the exhaust pipes near the 
flange where the rest og the exhaust attaches to is loose. I suspect it has deteriorated and it 
rattles. This drives me buggy (sorry for the slur). 

Anyone out there have a good idea on how to secure the shroud to keep it from making noises?
