PUT in a high quality name brand oil.  if you want to spend a little

leave the extra stuff to the infomercials.  if it worked don't you think
the oil companies would already put it into the oils????  That's one
competitive market out there

&gt; &gt; be corrosive to your bearings.  Well I am wondering if anybody has run
&gt; &gt; either stuff for an extended perriod of time and could tell me just exactly
&gt; &gt; how corrosive it really is.  I was told that the active ingreedient is
&gt; &gt; LinKite and I was wondering if anybody knew of a product that contained
&gt; &gt; LinKite but wasn't corrosive.  I am starting to think that the best thing
&gt; &gt; would be to stick with normal oil and change it regularly, so if that is
&gt; 
&gt; Linkite? OK this sounds like a silly made up name like LastOLene or maybe
&gt; Wareno how about Permex...
