Subject: [T2] Re: Boneyard in W. Alabama

Marv said he ran into a good boneyard near where the tusks are looser:

 &gt; &quot;Keiths&quot; is name of shop..but the Tuscaloosa pennysaver carries
 &gt; a different name. Anyone in that area who doesn't know of it,
 &gt; and needs a phone number..p-mail me.

Is this the place that used to sell WCM parts, I think the ads used to 
say &quot;dba 'Pappy's&quot;?  Seems like they had some rebranded WCM catalogs I 
saw at shows a few years back.

OBTW hi Marv! ;-)
