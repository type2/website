Subject: Re: spark plug order on the distributer

jon:

go look at the sheet metal shroud and find the big numbers
printed in it near the spark plug holes...this will increase the
odds that maybe one of the wires is in the right hole...
find the notch in the dizzy for # 1, and follow the firing order
in your book...you haven't turned the distributor  yet, have you ?
