&gt; &gt; I have a Craftsman Professional wire-feed welder that is running

&gt; &gt; wire. No gas just wire.
&gt;
&gt; gas just works so much better


I have a hose I can hook up for gas, but it is another thing I am very
unfamiliar with.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I cut up an old steel bed frame to practice one, but am having one hell
&gt; of a
&gt; &gt; time getting penetration through the steel!
&gt;
&gt; has the steel been tempered, some bed frames are spring or hardened
&gt; steel??


No idea. It seems just like a very sturdy steel frame. Grinds pretty well.

&gt; Duroc suggested slowing down the wire speed - which I did, but then I have
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; hard time maintaining an arc, and the results are the same.
&gt;
&gt; turn up the amps, the other switch on most welders....


Amps are up as high as they will go (Duroc's suggestion - up the juice)

&gt; Eventually, I have some spots of my Rivi that I want to weld panels into,
&gt; &gt; but I hear that heavier gauge steel is great for practicing on.
&gt;
&gt; true
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What am I doing wrong?
&gt;
&gt; well the big mistake I was making was trying to move too fast,  stay in
&gt; one spot longer, until the metal puddles


I guess I could spend a little more time in a spot and let the metal heat up
more. Just gotta maintain that arc I hear.
