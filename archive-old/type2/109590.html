Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Powdercoating Rims

I haven't tried those rattle-can hi-temp
muffler paints under powdercoat top coats, 
but if you believe the label, then they should 
be avble to withstand 400F _at_ 10-20 minutes :)

Powdercoat zinc rich primer gets baked.
Sandblasting is adequate surface prep
for wheels, but there is a potential problem area.
The crevice between the wheel rim and the center
tends to void application, due to an electromagnetic 
phenomena called the Faraday Cage effect.
The angle of the sharply opposing surfaces 
tends to repel the charge and the powder.

&gt; Duponts Vari Prime ( zinc chromate acid etch primer ) is the best stuff
&gt; you could use for any metal surface prior to painting--available at any
&gt; better body shop supply store.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT--I don't know if in fact it will withstand the baking process that
&gt; the powder coating needs to cure--
