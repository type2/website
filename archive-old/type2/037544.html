Subject: RE: A couple of final questions

&gt; Now, WHY does this hit?  Someones dies (can you say, Dansk?) 
&gt; for the rear
&gt; section of the muffler are way outta kilter, i think.  Oh, 
&gt; and the stud
&gt; holes are drilled and tapped not quite perpendicular to the flange...

The German mufflers are a much better fit, and nearly the same price.  You
pay your money...  As for the Dansk heat exchangers, same old story.  Gaps
everywhere and you have to 'remodel' them to fit round the fan housing.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; under the fan belt -- the screw fell in the heater box. Is 
&gt; that going to
&gt; &gt; cause any problems?
&gt; 
&gt; No.  Just an annoying rattle that you likely wont hear 
&gt; anyway, at least
&gt; until it jams itself in among the fins.;)

The only problem you might have is if the screw ends up jammed against the
little flap on the outlet of the fan housing.  But then, as you live in CA,
I don't suppose you have much call for heating.
