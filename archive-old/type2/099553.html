Just the &quot;aura&quot; from an evil PO.

&gt;I'll try to make it quick: replaced both heads in July.

Replaced them with what, exactly?

&gt;After the rebuild,.....

What was done in this &quot;rebuild,&quot; and by whom?

&gt;.....the compression was about 130psi all the way around (after a bit of
&gt;tinkering).  Now, ~250 miles later, the compression readings look like:
&gt;65/80/50/75.

With the same compression tester?  Are you sure the O-ring on the tester is 
sealing properly?
Is your battery fully charged, and all spark plugs removed?

&gt;  Yikes!  I forgot to try the &quot;squirt some oil in&quot; trick
&gt;(though I'm not sure what it would mean if this affected anything).

It would mean that the piston rings are leaking, not the valves.

A leak down test is much more informative than a compression test.
The device costs around $50, and you must have some source of compressed
air--though high volumes are not required.

&gt;The engine has been running hot if I take it on any trip over, say, 15-20
&gt;miles (oil temp typ 230deg+).  Thus, all driving has been short trips of 5
&gt;miles or so.

Is this an accurate reading? (have you calibrated it with a known correct
lab thermometer--about $4 ?)  Is your cooling system (including all tinware
and seals) all present and installed correctly?

&gt;Have I totaled my engine?

You will if you keep running it way too hot.

&gt;Should I first try retorquing the heads?

It sure wouldn't hurt any.  I'd retorque the case while I was at it.

&gt;Evil spirits?

At the base of the PO's front door, arrange five black candles around
a chrome 009 distributor.  Light the candles.  Open a can of soda pop
(Budweiser will work fine, here).  Drink half, throw half away.
Read the &quot;Rap on Oil&quot; sermon from Muir's Idiot Guide backwards.
Blow out the candles, and sneak off without being seen.

&gt;On a side note (following the spirits thought)... when I dug out my
&gt;compression tester from the the footlocker underneath the back seat, I
&gt;found a mysterious Clymer manual which covers '61-'79 buses.  Weird!

Burn it, unless you have need for a doorstop.

&gt;I've never seen this in my life before, and there it was sitting on top of my
&gt;usual pile of tools and parts.

Forget about the doorstop--just burn it!!

&gt;  The bus is always locked (not that that
&gt;means much) and nobody I know admits to sticking it in...  Just freaky.
&gt;Maybe it holds the key...

Clymer............evil..................burn it NOW!!
