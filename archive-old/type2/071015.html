&lt;&lt; Which models have the full width bed?  And what do you lose other than the 
propane stove? &gt;&gt;

M.R.

I have a 1974 westfalia with a full length rear bench, a propane stove and 
12v/110v fridge unit behind the passenger seat and a sink/water tank/storage 
cabinet unit behind the driver seat.

You still have the propane stove, what you &quot;lose&quot; with a pre-76 westy is the 
2 liter fuel injected engine.  I recently purchased a 79 westfalia and I like 
the floor plan a bit better than the 74 (plus the plaid upholstery is toned 
down somewhat!).
