&gt; Hi folks:

&gt; I am facing the same thing.  Since August my bus has been the daily
&gt; driver, though relief is in sight.

And what's wrong with driving your bus every day?  It likes the attention!


  I had a rusty leaky mess of an
&gt; Eberspracher in mine which was quickly removed.  My questions:
&gt;
&gt; Is this technology safe?  Shutoff switches etc.

If properly maintained, it is safe.  Never heard of a bus catching fire
because of a gas heater.  All failure modes shut the thing down unless
some idiot bypasses a safety feature.
