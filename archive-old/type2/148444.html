&lt;I know you have to pay 10 dollars and they only take cash.  Weird.&gt;

Yeah, I just renewed my TN driver's license today. It's my birthday.... Roughly $20 and cash or check only. It's a state thing I guess. Gave up my motorcycle endorsement though b/c it doubled the fee and I don't currently own a motorcycle though I'd like to.

Looks like Knox county is not an issue. Surprising...
