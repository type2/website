	Subject: Re: [T2] etching tin

	&gt;Question: What do i use to etch the tin before painting (acid of
some sort)
	&gt;and is this really necessary? If it's clean bare metal does it need
to be
	&gt;etched?

Painting over clean, bare metal will probably peel down the road.  Back in
the old days etching was the only way to do it but nowadays they have self
etching primer.  If you don't have the self etching primer you can etch the
metal with undiluted lemon juice.  Pour some on a damp rag and wipe it on.
then take another damp rag to wipe it off after its had a chance to work for
a minute.
