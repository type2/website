Subject: Mexbus??

         Can anyone tell me how long the Mexican  bus has been produced,
and also what the price is in U.S. $.  I've been trying for awhile to
hit their site, but no go.  http://www.vw_dot_com.mx
      And how does that outfit that sells the Mexbeetle bring them in to
the country? Do they import them after putting them on the old US pan,
or before?
