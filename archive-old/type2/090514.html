Subject: Re: [T2] Eberspaecher BA 6 Gas heater

The BA6 guru of the vanagon list is Robert Kezer (sp?): 

warmerwagen_at_hotmail_dot_com

Chances are he can help you trace the parts you need.

Thanks,
Chris

SNIP

A BA6 gas heater (211 261 105 E) is the part number. Does 
anyone know where I could get it test and/or a safe procedure 
to test the unit myself.
