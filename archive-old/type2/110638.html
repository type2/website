&gt; &gt; I have not seen the CD.

&gt; There are two CDs.
&gt; 
&gt; The 75-79 CD and the Yellow book are the same. The other CD contains similar
&gt; material that probably comes from another repair manual. I can't say Type 1
&gt; Repair Manual (one must exist) because the CD is relevant to Types 1,2,3,4
&gt; and 181.

I've been considering getting the CDs. My problem is that have Sparcs
running Solaris and Macs running OS X. Is there a chance in heck that
I'd be able to look at the CD with either? There's a windows emulator
that runs on OS X, and that could be used if necessary.

I don't suppose the CD is just a bunch of .pdfs with some proprietary
indexing/access software is it?
