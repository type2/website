Subject: Child Bracket Orientation 

The snap goes underneath the child cot bracket, as shown in your '800F'
photo.
Good Luck,

&gt; I'm putting my '78 Champagne Edition Westy back together after the paint
job
&gt; and can't quite remember how the child cot bracket and curtain snap were
&gt; oriented on the pillars behind the front door.   If those of you with a
later
&gt; Westy could take a peek at these pics and tell me how yours is set up, I'd
&gt; greatly appreciate it. The bracket actually fits perfectly in both
positions,
&gt; so it's hard to say which is right
