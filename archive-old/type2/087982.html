Subject: RE: can't find ND oil

&gt; SSIA really....I'm looking for non detergent oil, but
&gt; i need something heavier than 30 weight.  anyone know
&gt; where i can find it?  i've tried all auto parts
&gt; stores....

My web search for &quot;something heavier&quot; yields at least two vendors who
will sell non-detergent oil by the case:

Millennium Lubricants - 1-800-OILS-R-US  (10W through 50W ND available,
brand unspecified)
Harvey Oil - 906-226-0866 (8-5 M-F Eastern, lists Phillips 66 ND grades
10W through 50W)

Note that for those who just need 30W non-detergent, you can
special-order a case of it at any Napa Auto Parts store.

Hope this helps!
