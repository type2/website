Subject: Re:cutting out

I seem to recall that my buddy's '37 Willys would cut out at 
road speed when turning to the right on a bumpy road.  It 
was a harry experience at night because even the lights 
would cut out when turning a corner.  'Problem was that the 
battery would tip and ground out the hot lead against the 
fender so we tied the battery down with some rope.
