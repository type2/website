I'm hoping I'm reaching all those who have shown an interest in the
subject of valve settings for TypeIV 2000cc Air cooled engines.
On Thursday I made an uneventful trip of approximately 200 miles at 50
-55 MPH and about 2000 RPMs on country and Farm to Market roads South of
Dallas Texas. The valve setting at this time was two turns as recommended
by the Bentley and Hayes manuals. Overall performance was good with no
detonation. The spark plugs looked good and were clean with little
coloration change to measure.
On Friday I made another uneventful trip of approximately 200 miles at
50-55 MPH and about 2000RPM's with a valve setting of 3/4 turn as
recommended by John Connolly. The engine ran fine but I had head winds of
15-20 MPH and gusting winds so any difference in the performance was
masked by the adverse conditions.
With 432 Miles on the engine the oil is just barely reaching a color that
can be seen on the dipstick (oil was changed after 20 minute run-in at
2000RPM recommended by Steve Blackham who himself just finished building
a similar engine to run at 3500 to 4500 feet altitude.)
I'm going to stick with the 3/4 turn adjustment for the duration of my
thousand mile under 50MPH break in period and forego those long boring
Farm to Market road trips where I spend 50% of my time driving on the
shoulder of the road allowing tailgaters to pass.
A message to tailgaters from Stan Wilder &quot;If you can't exhibit enough
self control to abide by the speed limit; why should we trust you with a
gun!&quot;
I invite your comments and hopefully I'll have answered my own questions
through trying a variety of valve settings that others have had success
with.
My goal in this is simply to have a long life engine; I'm willing to
sacrifice some performance to run cooler, run longer and operate
trouble-free for an extended period of time.
Since Texas is mostly flat and mostly at an elevation of 35 feet to 230
feet above sea level I'm probably running in ideal conditions most of the
year with the exceptions when the temperature is over a hundred degrees
for weeks at a time (41 Days last year).
Thanks to all who have offered information, experience and good
commonsense advise.

&gt; &gt; I'm currently working on valve settings and getting a wide variety

&gt; &gt; responses.

&gt; &gt; RE: I had nothing but problem with the &quot;recommended&quot; 1 3/4-2 turn

&gt; &gt; I ran
&gt; &gt; 3/4 turn in and never a problem. John ..Aircooled.Net Inc.

&gt; 
&gt; what kind of problems are you having??  I use 1.5 turns myself
