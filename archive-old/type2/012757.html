I sincerely believe that you can get a very high quality commercial
carpet pad and cut pieces to fit. Most of it is fire resistant and
treated against mildew.

I have a piece under my kitchen area carpet in my van and after five
years it shows very little breakdown.

My pad is only about 1/2 thick but they had heavier and other types that
were more resilient, antistatic, self adhesive and a wide variety of
options one might want for lying under carpets in elevators. 

That is is the use, under elevator carpet that my small piece came from.

&gt; Yikes..well I guess this is why we have this list...there is always 
&gt; someone
&gt; else who has done something you are thinking of doing.
&gt; I have not started my soundproofing proofing project yet, but am 
&gt; gathering
&gt; information.  I don't think I want to go as far a Mathew Bulley
&gt; did but I would like to get the noise down in the cabin of my bus.
&gt; If anyone has any advice or experiences with this, please p-mail me 
&gt; and I'll
&gt; make a general post of things people have done to tackle this issue.
