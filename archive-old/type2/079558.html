Subject: clutch and flywheel off

So, I was playing around with the engine stand mount and finally decided
(with the help of list member's suggestions) that I would have to take
the clutch off to safely attach the stand mount.  So, I got the clutch
off pretty easily, but MAN are those flywheel nuts tight!!!  I used the
idea in the Muir book but used a pair of plyers around a bolt through
the engine mount and into the teeth of the flywheell while I used my
wrench to undo the bolts.  I was going to leave the flywheel off, but
I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't want to inadvertantly scratch the
innards or get any oil inside there.  That'd prolly be bad ;)

Tomorrow, engine goes on the mount and I'm pullin' all the FI and tin
off.  If I have time I'll try and get the exhaust off too.  I'm very
anxious to get to that cylinder #4 to find out why I lost compression!

I'm also excited to take all my tin and cooling shroud to the spray
booth to make it all nice and shiny.. don't know what colors yet..
hmm....

later all!

Mike
