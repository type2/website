Subject: coil diagnosis...

Greetings...

Quick question...

Can anyone describe some of the signs and symptoms of a weak coil or a
coil that is fading fast?  What types of things are associated with this
and how does one know when to replace it?

Not that it matters, but it's a 12v coil on an upright engine.

Thanks,

Tom
