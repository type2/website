Subject: shifter adjustment

    The bus is finally running and I took it for a drive tonight down 
the road a little. I also put some gas in at the station. I replaced all 
the bushing
and regreased my shifter,but can't seem to get it adjusted properly. Any 
tips on this? I also had pulled the gas tank and replaced all the hoses
and fuel sender. The only hose I did not replace was the hose from the 
tank to the filler pipe. As everyone knows it's not available. Mine did 
look ok though. When I squished it I didn't see any cracks so I put it 
back on. When I stick my nose near the right rear vent I can faintly 
smell gas. I think! I hope the hose didn't fall apart when it got gas on 
it. I am hoping the smell is from the paint on new parts burning off. 
I&quot;ll keep
my fingers crossed. I want to know when one of the vendors is going to 
reproduce it.I tried the Napa hose and it didn't work and I tried to 
find something at a Marina with no luck. Oh well. I'll hope for the best.
