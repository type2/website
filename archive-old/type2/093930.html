Subject: Gas Heater ID

Hello Listers:

I have a gas heater that's an Eberspacher-type that some of us have in our
busses.  However, there's no manufacturer info on it that I can find, so I
can't say that it's an Eberspacher.  It could be a Stewart-Warner or some
other make.  Could some of you fellow Listers be kind enough to take a look
at a picture of this thing and take a shot at ID'ing it?  I'll have to
e-mail the pic to you individually, but it's worth my time.

Thanks,

Jim Hood
