Subject: Re: [T2] No compression, weird valve

On Sun, 24 Mar 2002, Dave Rogge wrote:

&gt; So, the valve closest to the front of the bus on cyl. 1 is quite 
&gt; strange.  I found that it could not be adjusted, because i could take 
&gt; the adjuster all the way out, and the valve was still pressed tight 
&gt; against the rocker.  I removed the rockers and that valve is out farther 
&gt; than the other one, by a 1/4 inch or so, at least.  So, i'm going to 
&gt; drop the engine to remove the head and see what's going on with that. 
&gt;  Has anyone else had this problem?  I'd hate to pull the engine if i 
&gt; don't have to.  

common 2Liter problem, sunken valve seats, replace head.
