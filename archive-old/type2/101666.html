Subject: RE [T2]: Q-Pad substitute

Hi Jared,

This might be the stuff you are talking about:

http://www.partsexpress_dot_com/webpage.cfm?webpage_id=3&amp;SO=2&amp;&amp;DID=7&amp;CATID=48&amp;Ob
jectGroup_ID=37

I posted about it a few months ago.  It has worked well for me in my '72.  I
covered the areas around the engine and put a couple sheets inside each
door.  Cheap, easy to work with (especially if you install it on a 100
degree July day, ask me how I know) and pretty effective at getting rid of
the tin can sound in your bus.  No stink or problems with adhesive on hot
days.

						Hope this helps,

Does anyone remember a few months back, there was someone who said they
found a substitute for Q-Pads that was cheaper yet worked just as well? Does
anyon remember what that stuff was? Even if no one remembers, does anyone
have any suggestions? I'm starting to gather materials to insulate my bus
per www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex, but I don't want to fork over the money
for Q-Pads if there is a cheaper alternative.

Thanks,

Jared
