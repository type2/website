Re: The insulating properties of paint, exploited, in a manner of speaking.

Or, more simply, without knowing the insulating properties of paint, how can
you know its value as a heat conductor? Maybe Bulley knows.


For the whole story: http://www.ravallielectric_dot_com/b5.htm


R-Paint Changes the Way We Build


A new paint will soon be available that will make insulation as we know it
obsolete. R-Paint, manufactured by Sherwin-O'Brien Paint Company, promises
an R-value of 26 with one coat of paint. R-Paint is expensive at just over
$50 a gallon, but there's no question it's worth every penny. The building
world is scrambling to prepare for the consequences.
Until now a typical R-26 wall required a 2x6 framed wall plus an inch or so
of high grade foam. Now, the only lumber you need in the wall is lumber
enough to keep the wall standing. With this new innovation, technically you
could build your home out of cardboard, paint it with R-Paint, and end up
with a toasty warm structure. Just when we thought all colder-climate
builders had moved up to the 2x6 wall and beyond, now there's no reason for
more than a 2x4, maybe only a 2x2 exterior wall.
Insulation companies will be especially hard hit. An R-52 in the attic used
to require anywhere from 14 inches up to 20 inches of blown-in insulation.
Now you can accomplish the same R-value with 2 coats of R-Paint. An R-30 in
the floor used to mean a 10 inch fiberglass batt. Now one thick coat of R-
Paint will do the trick.
The only drawback to R-Paint is it's color, which can only be described as
pink. In order to achieve the full R-value the paint must be completely
visible on the inside or the outside of the exterior walls. If you paint the
outside of your home it must be pink, and it must stay pink. If you paint
the inside of your home you better learn to love pink. You cannot cover
R-Paint with wallpaper. You are even discouraged from hanging photographs or
paintings on exterior walls. Pink will undoubtedly be in fashion as the new
&quot;green&quot; color.
The beauty of R-Paint is that it works anywhere and everywhere. All those
homes that were poorly insulated in the past now can be treated to cut their
heat loss in half. A home that was an energy albatross for the owner and the
power company can now be fixed. Smaller furnaces and heaters will replace
large energy hogs. Eventually we'll all be in the pink, so to speak.
