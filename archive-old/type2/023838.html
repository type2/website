Stan, so glad to see you mention this!!!

I have a '78 2.0 FI Westy that came to me in Houston via New Mexico.  My plates expire this month (!) and I'm scared to death of taking the &quot;in-the-tailpipe&quot; exhaust test I need to finally register my beloved bus here.

ANY ideas that anyone could share before I take the test?  I'm willing to go take the test, share the results, then take suggestions.

Basically I'm at your mercy!
