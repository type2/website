Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables question

Chris,

When I replaced one of mine on the 78, I used the cable end and old
cable I took out to make the new cable like the one you need.  

Recycle, Recycle, Recycle!

I still have about 6' of the old sheatch and wire.

BTW, I have seen a single cab corvair Pickup that is being restored
driving around town here....It's starting to look good!


Cheers, dave

&gt; Here's a question for you: I have the cable sheaths but the two short cable wires are shot. 
 I'd like to shop for about 25 feet and replace (recreate) my short cables. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
