&lt;&lt; does a 30PICT-3 have this dreaded plug??
 where and what is it?
 thanks!

look at the carberateer (sp)   from behind the vehicle, the side that goes 
towards the back bumper (if there) should face you.   Carbs with plugs have 
them in a clearly visible location right there, on the bottom half of the 
carb.   They are round and just under dime sized.  If the plug is gone, the 
VW runs really badly and you can poke your finger through the hole into the 
carb.

THink the square bowled carbs have plugs, and the round bowled ones don't, to 
make an offhand generalisation.
