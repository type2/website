Subject: Re: [T2] Maaco (was Re: Anonymous threatening letters)

I had an Earl Scheib in the 70's that had peeling problems shortly
afterwards. I had a Maaco job more recently that seemed good. They
were using a mainline paint, Dupont IIRC. Heard they take a little
extra care when they see you do good prep work.

&gt; &gt;I've never heard of a satisfied Maaco paint customer: when I researched paint,
&gt; &gt;everyone who had anything to say about Maaco said stay away.  (Of course, if
&gt; &gt;there are any satisfied Maaco customers here, you should say something now!)
