FWIW
I've seen it both ways, depends on which westy package you got. The pop top
was an option that could be ordered with all the packages. One diff I've
seen is that those with nets had a wood beauty sheet over the rear springs
and those with a shelf did not

&gt; Jason:
&gt;
&gt; My 69 Westy has an elastic net with a wire frame that hangs above the rear
&gt; bed.  But my Westy has a poptop, and from what I know, the poptop Westies
&gt; have the net; the hardtop Westies have a shelf (I have a 74 hardtop Westy,
&gt; and it has a shelf, and shelf is made from and looks identical to the
&gt; material the cabinets are made of).
&gt;
&gt; My Westy manuals (1968 and 1970) say otherwise.  The 1968 manual only
&gt; mentions the net, and my 1970 manual only mentions the ceiling
&gt; cabinet.  The 1974 Westy manual I have says that only hardtop Westies have
&gt; the ceiling cabinet.  Go figure...
&gt;
&gt; I'm 99% sure what my 1969 Westy has is correct.  The only thing I've
messed
&gt; with is adding an electric pump to the sink.  I kinda wish I had the rear
&gt; cabinet so I had somewhere nice to mount some rear speakers.  But the net
&gt; is handy for storing stuff at night when you're sleeping back there.
&gt;
&gt; I'd go snap some pictures, but my Westy is 300 miles from me right now..

&gt; &gt;Hi Joe.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I recently bought a 69 hardtop Westy. (sorry, no manual) but I was
&gt; &gt;wondeirng if you know wether yours is unaltered, what is above your rear
&gt; &gt;bed area?
&gt; &gt;Mine has a plywood shelf, but no front on the shelf, and the wood is
wood,
&gt; &gt;not laminate like the cabinets. So I eckon it was put there by a PO.
&gt; &gt;Someone else said there is a net that goes over there instead of a shelf,
&gt; &gt;but VW had the shelf in 67 and I remember it in my dad's 72.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Whatcha got?
