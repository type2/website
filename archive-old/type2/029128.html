Hey y'all
I guess I need to change my shortcut name for Everybus.  This year it didn't
rain a-tall, so Soggybus is no more.

I didn't sleep much the night before because I was so excited (and fulla
caffeine from the trip to the Karmarosa).  Sherry got out of work early and
was home by 12:30.  The kids and I had the Award Winning Burrito Express
loaded and ready to rock.  Last minute stuff and off we went to Everybus via
the Tag Agency in North Wilkesboro because after I got the computer at the
tag agency in Lenoir back up the fat lady decided to make toast and moved
the toaster I was using to hold the modem cable in place so they could
connect to Raleigh.  Bad spot in the modem cable that if you kept it just-so
they'd be able to do the job until the real tech guy got there.  Guess she
gets paid even if she doesn't do any work that day.

On the road again, S on 421, we're all in a good mood.  Get off 40/421 onto
421 and there's a Vanagon towing a trailer.  I know the guy by sight and am
embarrassed to say I don't remember his name.  A short trip to the
campground, looks different when you arrive in daylight and clear skies.
Pull in, there's Chris.  Greetings and hugs all 'round, set up in the outer
infield so maybe the rest of the Full Moon Bus Club can occupy almost the
same area.  As usual that didn't work out but that's ok. Shortly thereafter
Bear shows up in the Irish, Daisy doing the driving as usual ;)  As we set
up, more buses come streaming in.  Greetings to all our friends, especially
the ones we haven't met yet.

It's almost overwhelming, bus after bus after carabus, big grins, I can hear
the buses I know and was annoying Sherry because I was saying here comes
.....  and there they'd be.  One of the many cool things about buses is that
most of them have an individual and distinctive sound that after a while you
can tell who's coming without looking.

As people come in and get settled, they'd come by and say Hi, or we'd walk
over and say hello.  I fell asleep Friday night to the music of the flat4 in
all it's permutations.  No nasty wrecker noises (yet).

Saturday morning, wake up in the Express, feeling the comfort only she can
provide.  Something about sleeping in the Express is it's just so comfy.
She's got a good aura that I find relaxing.  Wander out into the day in
search of coffee and what else may come.  The day was full of bus people,
arrivals, renewed acquaintances.  As the afternoon wore on, I could smell
the chili cooking in the different sites, some spicy, some mild, some
recipes I wonders at the ingredients, then remembered I didn't see much road
kill on the way in &lt;|;^p.

The judges are ready, the chili gets carried in.  Almost 20 varieties.  Only
1 was untasted, but that's because Bear left it in the can and didn't leave
us an opener.  The cooks all watch as we file past, sampling each entry,
sometimes going back to re-try and compare.  A short conference and we
decided, but there's no way we were going to tell yet.  Dinner finished, the
ominous grumblings of distressed intestinal tracts already starting in,
everyone clears the way for the contest results and door prizes.

the chili cookoff winners were John Staincamp (Chicken/cheese) and the fella
with the green chili pot (tasty veggie).  I can't think of his name but he
passed us on his way home in his red splittie, waving with all his fingers.
As a hint, the winners were not so hot they were unpalatable, they were the
best combination of flavors, spice, and ingredients.  Also, I was glad to
see that the people's tastes matched us judges closely, as our favorites
were completely eaten in a short time.   The prizes were a t-shirt and a
bottle of Beano.  A while later I think most everyone wished they had some
too.  Maybe next year I'll make Beano the 1 required ingredient in every
batch of chili.

Door prizes distributed and a big THANK YOU to Chris for a great campout.
The local Bluegrass pickers arrived, broke out the instruments, and
commenced to making a joyful noise.  they were great and had a most
appreciative audience.  I listened for a bit, then drifted off to see to the
ceremonial sacrifice of the engine case.

Someone already had the fire rip-roaring so all that needed to be done was
remove the oil relief plug and carry it over.  On the fire she went, the
case heated up.  You could see the oil catch, then the grease on the case.
It started spitting blue white sparks then she caught.  If you've never seen
a case burn it's a glorious sight.  It lights up the sky, burning so white
and hot that it actually emits some ultraviolet, making t-shirts glow like
they're under a black light.

Back and forth, round and round stopping to chat with folks.  It got late, I
started yawning, soon it was time to crawl back into the Express and that
wonderfully comfy z-bed.


Sunday morning, wake to the sound of birds and my kids snoring in the upper
bunks.  Up I get, to 'take care of busines'.  The park's septic system
definitely got a workout.  Shower and into the day.  I'm sorry to say, Full
Moon Bus Club didn't have our s(&amp;t together so no breakfast burritos for 400
either morning.  Drink coffee, drift around and talk in between periods of
breaking


camp (betcha thought I was gonna say wind).  Keith and Denise had a nasty
noise start in just as they arrived so they called a friend with the coolest
wrecker you'd ever want to see.  Chat some more with Dave Raistrick and the
other folks I see all the time on the list and chat thingy.  Finally it's
time to go,  gotta stop in Hickory at SCA fighter practice, not to fight
this time, just to pick up something Heidi needed for school.

The Express is in need of some maintenance.  She needs a case retorque and
another clutch and front seal.  The clutch was slipping on the hills due to
the oil soaking it's gotten and the extra weight from the camping gear.  The
Foghat tune Slow Ride came to mind as we crawled up the hills on 40, get as
much momentum as we could going down, and so it was fun dicing with the
trucks.

The family slept on the way back so Rocky kept me company, looking out the
window and growling at whatever.

I needed that.  Thank you to Chris for putting on such a great campout,
thank you to all the folks that were there for making it so cool.

BTW, Tom Cates, I DO know the words to O Canada, just I don't know them in
English, having spent much of my younger days on my uncle Ed's farm in
Quebec.  Blame Canada was just what happened and I DON'T know all the words
to that one ;-)

BTW if you've read all of this, here is a link to the pictures I took.
