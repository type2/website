Subject: RE: More On Westy (sink) Water Pumps
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;    I found out today that the water pump on my sink has died too.
&gt; Mine is a '76, pump that was there is a &quot;Handi-Pump #5000&quot; made
&gt; by Rand-Tek Inc in N. Hollywood Ca. It screws into the bottom of
&gt; the plastic water tank, has an in-line fuse holder on the side.
&gt; Is this the original pump? Ron, is this the one (or equivalant)
&gt; that you sell? I need one ASAP!  Thanks, Jeff

The one I sell for $24.95 is a different brand but replaces the Handi-Pump.
It fits and works the same as the Handi-Pump except that there is no inline
fuse, so you will want to attach it after the existing fuse.  I used this
pump for about two years on my '77, and it was still going strong when I
sold the bus.  One caution, though, when using this or the original pump, it
is a good idea to remove it during below-freezing months so that water does
not freeze and expand inside of the pump, causing it to crack.  This is the
biggest cause of premature failure of these pumps. Regarding Jan's pump,
which is not screwed into the bottom of the tank but instead mounted to the
wall near the tank, this is not an arrangement used on loaf Westies used in
the U.S.  However, early Vanagon Westies used this arrangement here, and it
was in fact the same pump.  There was simply a short length of hose that
went between the tank and the pump rather than the pump screwing right into
the tank. So I think it's likely that your pump is the same.  (As an aside,
U.S. Westies from about '82 on used a sumbersable pump instead, which I sell
for $29.95. This submersable pump is also a good choice for someone adding a
water supply to a non-Westy or fabricating a tank, as all you need to do is
use any large water container and then just drop the pump into the tank.)
