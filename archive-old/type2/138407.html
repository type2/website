Subject: Thinking ahead 30 steps or so

Two questions, just to remove some ambiguity in my mind:

1. I'm going to be testing my engine and doing the first twenty-minute 
run before installing it by bolting up the whole transmission (no &quot;old 
bellhousing&quot;). For this test, can I leave the clutch hardware out with 
impunity? (If there are leaks behind the flywheel, I'd rather they 
didn't foul the clutch disk right off).

2. Once I've determined that there are no oil leaks (fingers crossed), 
can I install the clutch hardware (new), bolt the transmission back on, 
and test the clutch? That is, can I make gear changes and so forth with 
the transmission out of the bus? And if so, should I test with the 
engine running? Or would a &quot;static&quot; test be satisfactory?
