Subject: RE: Fw: [T2] Heated front windshield??

&gt;Pics?

Well .. She's 7 1/2 months pregnant right now . The grass skirt has been let
out a few times!



&gt;I like the idea, but that is a LOT of money. At least to me. As for the
rest
of that stuff, only A/C is really worthwhile, and I doubt I'd appreciate the
HP loss in my bus.&lt;

If you think A/C is a worthwhile investment then a heated windscreen is
probably going to look expensive!    If you come from a coutry that invented
the hot water bottle before the wheel then a heated windscreen looks cheap
and A/C looks like something thought up by a fetish enthusiast.
