Subject: Re: [T2] handle?

Hi Dennis,

I mounted a HANG-ON!!! strap from a passenger bus on the inside of my 
slider. It uses one of the existing bolts and I drilled a hole for a 
short sheet-metal screw. I've used it at least three times and it 
hasn't snapped off yet!

&gt;
&gt; Notice I said 'had'...the first time you pull on it to close the door,
&gt; it snaps off...one of the more useless items IMHO...if anyone has a
&gt; better idea here, I'd love to hear it...
