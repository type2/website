Subject: a friday winter kindess story, (or why we do what we do)

woke up this morning to our first real snowfall of the year here in omaha,
nebraska.  less than 6&quot;..i know not very much.  anyways since i don't work
during the winter i was lounging with a bowl of homemade granola.  i had
just loaded the wood stove, and a nice hot fire was blazing.  boy, i just
realized i really do live the life of a bus owner.  anyway...i was looking
outside when i noticed a guy in a ferd teraus (you know what i mean!)  and
the hood was up and he was looking around in the engine compartment.  i
decided i better go see if i can assist.  

went out the the front porch and asked if he needed a phone or if i could
help (not to anxious at this point to get dressed for the snow just
yet!)...he walked up and said &quot;sure could...my car just shut down, i should
call a cab and get a ride, and have my mechanic pick this car up later.&quot;

so he came in a made a couple calls.  he immediately, with cordless phone in
hand, migrated to the wood stove and was standing as close as possible
without catching the rear of his pants on fire!  

we chatted a few moments about what might be the problem with the car.  i
asked where he was going.  he said to the airport.  i offered to give him a
lift (since i needed some motivation to get off my butt and go run some
errands in town).  he gladly accepted.  since my wife already had her super
beetle cleaned off and was out this morning i thought lets take it and save
some time cleaning off the van.  

so we jummped in and off we were.  not more than a few minutes into it i
noticed him helping wipe down the windows from the moisture that had begun
to collect.  i said &quot;it looks like you have done this b4...you ever own a
vw?&quot;  yup!  seems he had a 69 squareback for almost 10 yrs.  &quot;that
rear-wheel drive would go anywhere&quot;  he recalled.  we chatted about jobs,
kids (of which i dont have any), cars etc.  i asked where he was flying.  he
said nowhere, i work at the airport.  i asked which airline.  seems we knew
a number of folks at the omaha terminal (i used to work air cargo on the
ramp for 3 yrs).  he asked if i was looking for a job. i declined, stating
that i own a small landscaping business and only work part-time jobs in the
winter after our season is over.  he gave me his card and a promise to hire
me if i wanted a job with flight benefits next winter.  i said thanks for
the offer.  

we got there and he asked just before getting out of the car if my wife and
i travel much.  i replied that we are going skiing, in a few days in
minnesota.  he made an offer to get me a $25 *buddy* pass on any midwest
express flight anywhere in the u.s.  just give him a call and he'll get me
the ticket!!  i was, needless to say pretty plesed with that offer. 

so i said sure i'd give him a call in the next week or so.  so a 20 minute
kindness, brought me a job offer, and 2 r-trip tickets at $50 for the pair. 
plus he got to tell old vw stories to an avid listener.

i got home and sat myself down by the fire that was effectively removing all
traces of the outside from my body, and pondered...

what makes most vw owners kind?  or is the vw that makes most of us kind? 
are we just a likely to stop and help if we are driving another car?  i
would like to think we are drawn to a simpler lifestyle.  like the listee
who reflected on being able to let your mind wander when not rushing around
in traffic.  (cuz' if you are driving a vw..you are for sure not in a rush).


 so i guess i concluded, at least in my case, the willingness to help, the
vw(s) and my lifestyle are all intwined, but thats the way i like it.  now
to refill my bowl of granola, life (at this brief moment) cannot get any
better.

take care
