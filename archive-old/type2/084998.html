Subject: RE: [T2] Insurance info for 78 Bus

That is a complex question as we have had State Farm for over a decade, we 
also have our Honda insured with them, AND we have our house insured with 
them.

So we get a &quot;multi-line&quot; discount, safe drivers over 25 years old, married 
with child, old fogey status, etc...

I THINK we pay about $250 for comprehensive insurance on the VW per year.

You might also check on insuring it as a classic, limited use, or as an RV.
