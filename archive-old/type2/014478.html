List,
Forgive my request for easily obtainable info, but i am at work and behind a proxy and cannot browse type2_dot_com.

Picked up a basketcase type4 engine recently in a boneyard. Appears to be 75 bus engine.
I'm trying to ID the distributor i found close by.

Written on the distributor:

&lt;----  JFUD 4
0 231 181 012  VW  022 305 205 AB

Might someone help to ID this part?

Thanks,
clark gordon
