Subject: Re: [T2] No Wiring Harness

Thanks, I really appreciate the information. Do you see any reason why I
should not be able to use the 70-72 in my 1973 Bus? Are the wires just not
long enough?


Thanks, I appreciate it.

Todd

&gt;
&gt; 73 is the 1st year the fuse box moved to the center.  When the turn
signals moved up above the headlights, the
&gt; fuse box had to be moved.  70 thru 72, the fuse box was above the
headlight on the left. Each year, 70-72, has
&gt; a different fuse box and the wiring to them and the relays hanging out the
bottom are different.
&gt; 72 bus = 411 937 505 C
&gt; and if you are wondering about D and E:
&gt; 73 411 = 411 937 505 D
