Subject: Trip Report: The Feast!

Hey now,
     It's 7 August and we are enroute to Boya Lake Provincial Park, on the
Cassiar Highway in BC. This morning we lost 3 busses. Gary &amp; Correne set off
with the Freemans for Laird Hot Springs, thence to Edmonton &amp; Indiana
respectively, and Sue headed for Fairbanks AK. So of the original 14 busses
we'll be down to 7 tonight at Boya Lake. Tomorrow morning Bob Hoover and
myself will head for Stuart BC/Hyder AK, to get our taste of Alaska, and some
fresh seafood, while the others head down to Telegraph Creek on yet another
poor condition dirt road. It's somewhat sad to be slowly losing this
wonderful group of friends with which we've shared so much over the last 2
weeks, many of whom live so far away it will likely be years before our paths
cross again. Another adventure lies ahead, yet my soul wishes that this one
wouldn't end. But it must.
     However, we will have the memories. 
     One of them will be The Feast. On the night of 5 August, we pulled into
the Wolf Creek Campground just south of Whitehorse. The list was: Bob Hoover,
myself, Pete &amp; Sally, Sue, &amp; Gary &amp; Corenne. As I mentioned in my last
report, we had a group feast in the works, and oh what a feast! Sally made
this marvelous stew, with fresh veggies &amp; hamburger, Gary cooked up corn on
the cob over the campfire, everyone supplied parts of the salad, and Bob made
&quot;Bob's Beans La Boom&quot;! Truly exceptional, as only Bob's beans could be, they
consisted of refried beans, pork &amp; beans, BBQ sauce, mustard, and some
&quot;secret ingredients&quot; all mixed up in an old coffee can-Bob's standard cook
kit.  ;-) Pete &amp; Sally found some wonderful rolls at a bakery in town, and
the Strawberry/Rhubarb pie from the farm topped it all off. That meal will
likely remain as one of the high points of this trip for me, as we had
everyone around the table toghether to eat it. Just fantastic. Since we were
staying there the next day, we all stayed up late around the fire, and cooked
marshmellows. No one seemed to care that it was raining and spirits were
high. We had tarps rigged up, so they kept us dry.
     Summer seems to have ended in the Yukon. The leaves have become golden,
and the tempratures have dropped radically since our northward route. Amazing
how just a week can make such a difference. It seems somewhat fitting that
the summer and our expedition should taper off together. Slowly we approach
the final curtain together. But sadly, after this show, there will be no cast
party.
Peace,
Eddie
