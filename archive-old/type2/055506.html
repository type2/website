Subject: Re: 66 Bus at Auction

&gt;Hi all. The Barrett Jackson Auction, Reno Nevada, had a 66 Deluxe, non
&gt;sunroof  as far as I could tell, for sale. They said it had 460 original
&gt;miles and it sold for $20,000!!!! They didn't focus on it for very long,
&gt;but it sold quick!! Who's the lucky owner! This was on Speedvision this
&gt;weekend.

4900 original miles. $20,250. Just saw it on a tape replay this
morning. Wish they hadn't taken a break just when it came up.
