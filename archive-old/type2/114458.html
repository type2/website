&gt;So, i have two questions.  The first is, can anyone tell me about the 
&gt;requirements of the smog test, specifically the amounts of each gas 
&gt;allowed and what can be adjusted or added to control them?  

My experience is here (pmail me for any questions. I did it in December):

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/100121.html
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/100122.html
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/106346.html

&gt;And the second question.  I'm sure many people on the list have 
&gt;attempted to make a non-CA bus pass the smog test... Is it worth the 
&gt;work, or should i just start looking for an older bus?

You can determine how well you will do in the smog test before you leave by getting your exhaust sampled at the local garage. The #1 reason for failure is idle mixture too rich so get it set.

There are four components to the test:

- visual (all stock components present)
- timing (within 3 degrees of spec, rpm within spec)
- exhaust (depends on county but in general %CO and HC)
- gas cap (does it seal)

If you have a engine setup that is younger than the chassis you will have to go to the  smog referee and get it certified. For example 75 bus with 78 engine becomes a 78 bus and will smog a few more times before it becomes exempt. You cannot put a 75 engine in a 78 bus, only a younger setup.

The limits are here:

Your category will be (Truck &lt; 6000 lbs, 1975-1978). HC is measured in ppm and CO in percent.

Pass/Fail limit:
Idle HC 250
Idle CO 2.5
2500 HC 200
2500 CO 3.0

Gross polluter limit:
Idle HC 500
Idle CO 5.0
2500 HC 450
2500 CO 5.5

Min CO+CO2 7.0
Max idle RPM 1100

If you have an older bus (1974 or earlier) you are smog free as of Jan 1, 2003.
