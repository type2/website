Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

&gt; When I had the poptop off on my bus it looked to me like that frame 
&gt; was used as part of the mold for the fiberglass making it an integral
part.

I'm not sure if it was part of the frame originally.  The frame on mine
looks like it was added after the poptop shell was made, and then
&quot;fiberglased&quot; to the shell, although at the factory.  It wasn't painted the
same color as the shell.  I'm not an expert though.

I can tell you that after taking off the hinges completely, I found that the
frame there was completely rotted.  It had to come off.

I decided to remove the entire frame, as there were lots of other problem
spots in addition to the hinge section.  I wouldn't recommend it for
everyone since the frame is very well bonded to the poptop shell.  I
actually damaged the top slightly (read put a hole in the poptop) as I
chiseled the old frame off.  Ouch.  Additionally, the frame didn't come off
cleanly in all sections.  In some places, it actually pulled the gel-coat
off the shell, leaving a mess I'll have to refinish.  Double ouch.  I was
able to get the frame off in a few pieces however, from which I'll be able
to make a new frame.

I'm going to go down to the hardware store to look into wood for a new
frame.  Possibly something treated, but if not, I'll varnish it to protect
it.  I'll reattach the frame (after repairing the shell) with a heavy duty
adhesive, and then paint it along with the top.  The key for preventing this
in the future, I think, is to seal it.  Ron Dunn mentioned that he thought
it was where water has seeped down the bolt holes, and I think that's on
target.  I'll probably use some silicone sealant or something there.  Also
having a good poptop seal should also help minimize this.
