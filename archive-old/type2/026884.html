My grandfather made a set of wheel ramps out of wood for his 62 bus he 
purchased brand new (unfortunately he traded it in in 1970 for a new bus). 
They are about 3 or 4 feet long and slope slowly up so you don't bottom out. 
They work great on my 74 as the metal ones rise to quickly. I could get the 
dimensions if anyone is interested.

&gt;Has anyone ever made a set of wheel ramps for a bus?  I would think a set 
&gt;of carefully cross direction &quot;laminated&quot; 2X lumber would
&gt;do it.  Any comments?
