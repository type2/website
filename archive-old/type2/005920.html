Point well taken.

An inexpensive GPS unit can be had for ~$100,00, and they do indeed
incorporate an altitude function.

Or you can go for broke and use a dashboard mounted GPS linked to a laptop
and [with appropriate software] track your bus's every move.

Now if only there was an affordable and compact inertial guidance system :-)

&gt;&gt;  I was thinking of getting GPS. You can altitude from them as well
locations, distance travelled and so on. Prices are getting real good
for the basic models.

I spent 21 years as a ship's navigator, I would have loved to have
one a GPS. Back then GPS's were bigger than my bus and were not
installed on destroyers and frigates. When off soundings I mostly
used a sextant, chronometer and compass, LORAN was only good in
certain areas and Omega, in my opinion, was the biggest waste of
money in navigational history.  &lt;&lt;
