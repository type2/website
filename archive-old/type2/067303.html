Strange story to relate...

It was on a night, actually very much like tonite... My friends and
I (all VW owners) were sitting around a campfire and just shooting
the breeze a bit.  

We began to talk about strange incidents that have happened to us
while motoring around. A friend (I'll call him Harry), related that
when he was young, about 17, his Dad had got him a bus for his High School
graduation.  It was a cheapie 67 splittie, in need of lots of care.
Anyway, he drove that vehicle for maybe 5-6 years, selling it upon a
breakdown in Montana in 1986.  Hitched home to Ohio.

On his trip he was picked up by a lovely young lady named Lauren. They
really got to talk on this journey, got to know each other pretty well.
The upshot is that they stayed in touch for a long time..He, in Ohio, 
and she in Indiana.  Over time, there communications ended in love,
of a sort.  You see, she was already attached to a guy who drove a
Pontiac.  Their very real love for each other was on interminable hold.
A few letters - back and forth - kept them in touch.  Harry stayed
single, and Lauren was unhappy and stuck with her husband, even though
he became more abusive and cruel as time went on.

Harry, a bit of a tear in his eye, continued the story.

This &quot;estrangement&quot; between Harry and Lauren went on until one night
Harry got a frantic phone call from Lauren...&quot;Harry, you've got to help
me !!...&quot; Then Harry heard the phone hit the floor and a gunshot ring out.
Harry, fearing the worst, got into his '71 Beetle, stopped only to fill up 
the tank - and headed for Evanston to rescue the lady he loved.

About 40 miles away from coming to her rescue, he noticed the oil light
came on.  Forgetting St. Muir's advice, he drove on, figuring he could
make it.  Two miles later the engine just died.  It would turn over OK,
giving Harry a brief respite that it hadn't seized, but it wouldn't
start.  Harry grabbed his Phase I toolkit and went around to the engine
compartment.  He checked spark, he checked the points, he checked the
oil level.  All were OK.  

Then Harry, forgetting he was in open traffic, walked around the side
of the vehicle a little too wide.....

His was promptly hit by a '67 Splittie doing 70.

Later, in the hospital, Harry found that the Splittie that had hit him
was indeed the exact same one he had sold in Montana so long ago.  Only 
now it needed a new front apron and front windows.  Harry recovered from
his injuries and tried to contact Lauren...but she had left Evanston,
with no forwarding address.

As for Lauren's husband ?

Having narrowly missed a .38 caliber bullet to the head, and running
off in his new car, he was OK.  He was on his way back to Lauren after
letting her &quot;cool off&quot; a bit - in his most recent car...a '67 Splittie
he had picked up recently - from a guy in Montana.











Happy Halloween Everybody  !!!
