Hi all,

Boy do I feel stupid! 
I fixed a leaky accelerator pump on my carb today.
Decided to try and get it to idle better, so put
on the timing light just to make sure it was still ok.
 
Yep, about 10 degrees BTDC. Just where I set it months ago!
After all the talk about 009s etc I decided to check total
advance, rev up to 2000 rpm, advance to ....10 degrees ATDC!!

Not quite! I screwed up and had set it at 10 degrees AFTER TDC 
so it only advancing to 10 degrees BTDC. Duh!!!!!!!!!!

Set it THIS time to 10 degrees BTDC, total advance to about 30
degrees! Reset idle, took for a test spin, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!

Still holding my head in shame :-(
