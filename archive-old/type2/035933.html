Subject: RE: 3 cheers for Karl/a/c unit in central Fla

I have a feeling that if everyone helped by Karl (in hard parts or
irreplaceable advice) pitched in $10 or $20, we could easily buy him that
'78 that someone mentioned.

FYI, I owe Karl about $100 or more if I think about the *value* of parts
he's sent at cost...and another 3 billion pesos or so for the value of
information.

Same holds true for John Anderson and others.

Thanks! Joe
