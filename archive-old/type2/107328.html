&gt; I seem to blow out the booster fan 16A fuse every four or five months.

&gt; Anyone had any experience with this? Is the fan serviceable; does it require

Richard,

I use the booster fan a lot, as it gets cold here... I don't blow fuses, but
my fan motor and wiring do get very hot to the touch. I recently was working
in the engine hatch after running the fan for a long while. The wires
leading into the fan were very hot. The wires are all in good condition and
tightly connected.

An electric motor repair shop should be able to recondition the fan motor,
that is what I will do when mine stops working.
