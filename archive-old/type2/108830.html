Subject: Re: [T2] Need a decel valve

Checked the part number on mine and that is it below. I checked out the one
for the 928 on Pelican Parts and it isnt quite the right one. The 928 was
also a CIS injection. I dont know if that makes a difference. The good news
is I was able to find one at Rocky Mountain Motorworks. I called and the
salesman I talked to said that they were new Bosch units! We'll see if they
are &quot;new&quot; when it arrives. So, if you are in need thats the place.

Thanks for the ideas
