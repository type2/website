Subject: Re: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??

well yesterday I blew out a sparkplug (again) was out checking this
morning and it will screw back in but won't tighten...obviously
stripped.  problem is this is a &quot;temp&quot; head while I was getting a new
(rebuilt AVP) head on a stock 78FI 2L engine but it isn't here yet
probably at least a week.  this is my daily driver and I don't want to sit
for a week also it is very hot and humid so working on it is not enjoyable
at this point.   

   is there any way to get this temporarily back on the road without
pulling the engine or swapping the head??   damage to the head is
acceptable but don't want to risk the new pistons and cyl.   being lazy
don't want to pull the engine twice in two weeks.   

hard to tell looking (it is of course #3) but it may have been helicoiled
in the past, if it is can a helicoil be removed and replaced without a lot
of hassle?

any brilliant or not so brilliant ideas ??

clutching at straws, trying to hold it together without damageing it for a
week or two
