Subject: how does fan/thermostat work?

I have a 78 Bus I am trying to finish up and get on the road. This is my
first aircooled having owned several
water leaking vanagons. I was trying to locate my thermostat and can't
find it. I looked at the rod connected
to the flapper where a half in piece of cable is clamped to. I also
noticed these flappers(what do they do)don't move much.How does this all
work?Does it help with heating up,keeping the engine cool?Any one have
pictures of the thermostat set up? I have two new thermostats already.
What brackets cables do I need?Any info greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Bill
