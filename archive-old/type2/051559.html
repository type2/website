Steve,
  I saved a post from the list that mentioned that Kustom Warehouse
  (714-997-9893) sells tranny's rebuilt by Rancho Performance Transaxle
   for about $250.  Rancho charges about $450 for the same transaxle.
  This information is about 2 years old so I do not know if it is still
valid.
  Does anyone else have any info on Kustom Warehouse??

&gt;Now I have to find a new tranny.  Does Rancho Performance sell
&gt;direct?  (I need a trip to a warm place and would like to see if this
&gt;core is  worth anything before I spend money on shipping.) What other
&gt;vendors do you recommend?
                                                                 Bill &amp;
