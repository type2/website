O.K. I finally got the bus running after cleaning the carbs cleaned real good
and all. It ran great, until I found out that someone had  partially
disconnected the alternator(person that owned it before me). No big deal once
I figured it out. Well remember how I said that it ran really good. Not any
more. All of the sudden I started it and it idles for a few seconds then idles
down then up and so on and so on. If you give it gas if seem to bog a little
before it picks up. I really have no Idea what to do next. I dont think that I
did anything that would have affected the way that it idles. Its a 74
automatic with duel carbs. I realize that Ive taken on the responsibility of
owning a high maitinence vehicle but I am getting a little frustrated. It was
running so good. Please help me.
