Subject: Wicals Saga

Hey everyone another update on Troy Wicals and Family.

They've moved into the bay area (San Francisco area) and are moving 
again. The apartment they got into wasnt a great aituation according to 
Leah.

The bus was rear-ended and totalled by the insurance company, but before 
the vultures start to circle, they plan to restore the bus at a future 
date and have decided to hold on to it.

Leah says &quot;Hi&quot; to everyone in the bus family.

Just an update for those of you interested.

Tyler
