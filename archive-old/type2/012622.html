most mechanics should be able to put a helicoil  in
for you.  if they have a lift in thier garage they
should be able to put the bus on a lift and have easy
access to carefully drill above them and insert a
helicoil in with the engine in the bus.  i had one of
my rocker arm bolts pull out of the head on my bus
last summer and my local vdub mechanic was able to put
in a helicoil with the engine still in the bus.  just
a thought.
