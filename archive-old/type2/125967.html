Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

I built my own with 4 wheels. The problem I have the store bought stands is the 3 wheels (they WILL tip on certain surfaces) and the fact that I have to stoop to work on the engine. 

I built a NICE (for my needs) stand a few years ago for $60. You might be able to do better (or not China has run up steel prices A BUNCH lately). 

Pics available via p-mail. 

My stand has held a Corvair, Beetle motors, and type IV engines. PLENTY strong.
