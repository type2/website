Subject: Re: [T2] 82 vanagon hyd clutch

Hey Bill-

I had the same problem on my '81 a couple years ago. I replaced the
clutch cylinder and the problem recurred; it tunred out to be a leaky
slave cylinder at the rear of the bus. It's kind of a PITA to get to
(through the dr. side rear wheel well IIRC), but you might check for
leakiness there if you haven't already.

PS - I'm just down the road from you in Edmond, and Stillwater is my
home town (proud SHS and OSU grad!). I'm there quite a bit, maybe we
can meet up for a beer one of these days.
