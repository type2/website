&gt; In responding to my subject &quot;gas leak, 78, NEED ADVICE&quot;, one person
&gt; asked if I had topped up the tank.  The short answer is yes, but
&gt; there's half a story here that's almost worth telling, so if you're
&gt; bored...  [I'm not--I'm working.  Feverishly typing at my keyboard.
&gt; Looking busy...]
&gt; 
&gt; I live in NJ, and in NJ all gas stations are Full Serve, similar to
&gt; Oregon.  You're not supposed to pump your own gas.  I think they raise
&gt; 'em stupid in NJ or something, because I also hear tell of people who
&gt; call their Condo managers when they have a leaky faucet in their
&gt; bathroom.  But I digress...
&gt; 
&gt; I pull up to the pump, attendant walks over, and I give him the key to
&gt; my gas cap.  He goes and futzes for a minute.  Comes back to the
&gt; passenger side window, motions back toward the gas cap, and shrugs his
&gt; shoulders.
&gt; 
&gt; I get out, go around, and remove the gas cap.  By this time, the guy
&gt; has walked away.  So I reach to get the fill hose to start putting gas
&gt; in the tank.  The guy hurries back over and takes the nozzle out of my
&gt; hand and sort of shoos me away.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, because of the big vapor recovery hood on the fill nozzle, he
&gt; can't get the nozzle to push in the fill neck far enough to turn the
&gt; pump on.  So he motions me back over to hold the nozzle, and he
&gt; wanders away again.  When the pump shuts off, he hurries back, takes
&gt; the nozzle away from me again, tops off the tank, and hangs the nozzle
&gt; back on the pump.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, he motions for me to go ahead and put the gas cap back on.  I
&gt; do, then walk back to the front of the bus to get my wallet.  When I
&gt; come back and hand him the money, he says to me, &quot;I have the same kind
&gt; of gas cap on my car.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; HUH?????

The same type of nozzle that doesn't allow for the recovery nozzle to
hook up tight, and therefore hard to fill?

Aren't they a hoot?
