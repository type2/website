Subject: Re: [T2] aftermarket fuel pump hook-up

&gt; I traced the hot wire on the pump to one of the contacts on the coil.  The
&gt; pump comes on when you turn the key.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to install the recommended relay so that the fuel pump cuts off when
&gt; the engine stops.  But without FI, where's the best place to tap for the
&gt; relay?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm assuming that the existing wire can be the hot lead, but that I need a
&gt; wire that is &quot;off&quot; when the engine is not running to activate the relay.

The double relay helps to serve this function and when it gets throw away
with the conversion to carbs you have to go hunting for a replacement. You
still need to way to detect that the engine stopped.

Here is one solution:
