Subject: Gas Heater

Hi Volks,
   I recently acquired the carcass of a late model BN-4 gas heater.  I've 
checked the library and read the excellent articles there.  Besides a few 
parts, I find myself in need of a wiring schematic that is specific to the 
late BN-4.  If anyone has it, and can send me a copy, or can point me in the 
right direction to see one, I sure would appreciate it.  I'm determined to 
have this thing going by next winter.
   Thanks for your help.
