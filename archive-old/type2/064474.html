&gt; &gt;hmm, is this a joke? $5885? well shoot, i could get me a beautiful

&gt; &gt;bus for this.do buses that need body work and all that really go for this
&gt; &gt;much out west? and the appliances may not work?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;maybe i could start a business shipping buses from the southeast out west...

&gt; hey, jonathan, thanks for all your sarcasm. actually, i could probably 
&gt; get $7000 for it if i had the time to wait around. let's see: the new 
&gt; engine was $3500, the brakes $800, the oil cooler, $300 the tires $150, 
&gt; the kenwood system $600. that's $5350 right there, assuming that the rest 
&gt; of the vehicle has no value. i never gave it any thought, but i suppose 
&gt; these vans are in much greater demand out here. they are EXTREMELY 
&gt; popular all along the west coast: SF, Boulder, Santa Cruz, Seattle... 
&gt; anyway, if you don't think it's worth as much as i'm asking thats fine, 
&gt; but i really don't see any reason to be insulting.
&gt; 

I do not think he meant to be insulting, And I think he wanted to know 
what these vehicles are WORTH out here in the WEST...He did not ask you 
how much money you have DUMPED into your vehicle; he just wanted to know 
the average selling price out here.

my 2 cents!
