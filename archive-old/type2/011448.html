Subject: 1970 bus for sale Arnold Md
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

This bus is solid, needs:
engine 
1 headlight
rear lights
1 turn signal lense
an engine

otherwise complete w/poptop, jalousie windows, one of
the nicest sliding doors I have come across, sink,
camper seat behind drivers seat.Clean title, tranny. 
Someone could either take for parts but shouldn't take
much to get on the road as daily driver. I would like
around $400 OBO, sorry no pics. If I haven't sold by
the 27th I will strip and sell the parts at the
bugout.
