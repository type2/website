&lt;&lt; just thought you would like to know i talked to bob about 3:30 after
&gt;he got picked up
&gt;before atlanta, the cops searched him plus vans,truck and his baggage
&gt;they thought maybe he was transporting drugs possibly all is okay though
&gt;they expect to be home tonight around 12:00 or 1:00a.m.

Doesnt this sound like the GA cops were kinda picking on some bus folks 
?????
 &gt;&gt;

Sounds like a good enough reason to carry a cell phone and the # of the
local ACLU office...BTW, you can't be searched unless you give your per-
mission. If the officer tells you otherwise, he's mis-speaking.
