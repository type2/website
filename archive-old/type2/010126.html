Hi All,

I just want to thank all of you who have responded to my questions about starters,
relays, etc.  You are a blessing.

I hate to go against all the advice to &quot;do it yourself&quot; because I know it is the
right thing to do, but I will not have time between now and my Redwoods trip to play
with this (my 40 hr a wk job and other duties getting in the way again!!), so I am
going to have it done.  I WILL eventually work on this vehicle myself.  I've already
learned more about cars and how they run than I did during my 1st 50 yrs on the
planet.  I know that I will be able to work on it with your help and the help of
various manuals.

I called the shop back up and got precise quotes for the work: before he was only
estimating.

Costs will be:

New Bosh Starter: $110
Labor for starter:   $  60
Relay:				    $  27
Labor for Relay:	    $  63

Total for parts &amp; Labor:  $260.00  

Thanks again for everything,

Dale G
