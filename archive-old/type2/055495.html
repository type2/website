Subject: got the side window in--pheeew!

The subtitle to this post is: &quot;The hardest job I've ever undertaken on my
van.&quot; Those side windows are about as tight as...something real, real
tight. Unbelievable. There were times I was pushing so hard on the window I
had visions of going through it, wrists first, and impaling myself on
shards of broken glass. Is there really any need for that thing to be that
tight? On the bright side, the pyramids will crumble before that window
leaks a drop of water.
