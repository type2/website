Subject: RE: BUS / VANAGON Tires (Tyres?)

Well, the (tire/tyre) plot thickens...and sickens......

I received a phone call this afternoon from a Michelin &quot;Sales Engineer&quot;, 
calling from Michelin's North American headquarters, in response to my recent 
e-mail inquiry.

First, the Michelin XC4S 185R14 Reinforced tire that I &quot;discovered&quot; in the 
Sam's Club catalog has been discontinued.

Second, _ALL_ Michelin 185R14 Reinforced tire models have been superseded and 
replaced by Michelin's &quot;AGILIS 61&quot;.  This is a 185R14 Reinforced tire imported 
to North America from Europe (big deal, all Michelins were imported from 
Europe for many years).  This tire supposedly has the appropriate load rating, 
etc., but is NOT rated &quot;All Season&quot; and/or &quot;M&amp;S&quot;.  Plus, this tire is 
available only by &quot;special order&quot;.  Michelin's Part Number for this tire is:  
78012

We had a fairly long discussion about the tire needs of Transporter and 
Vanagon owners.  He wasn't familiar with our specific requirements, and was 
surprised to learn that even late production Vanagons needed a reinforced tire 
in the 185R14 size.  He asked about the need for an M&amp;S rating, and I 
explained a bit about the State's requirement for tires branded M&amp;S on the 
passes under typical winter conditions, and the requirement for chain 
installation as an alternative even when they're not really needed.

We also discussed alternative tire sizes and the clearance problems they often 
present, especially when chains are required.

I gave him a lot of information and specifications, and he promised to do some 
more research and get back to me.  Time will tell.

I'll post to the Lists when or if I get more information.
