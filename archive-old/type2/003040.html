Hey Jim,

Thanks for the encouraging note.  My wife and I really love our bus and
enjoy camping in it.  This latest problem just caught me at a bad time with
little patience and plenty of frustration.

Until later,

Darrin.

&gt; &gt; yes, I'm considering selling the bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Someone talk me out of it.
&gt;
&gt; If you buy another car, and it acts up (watercooled cars like to act up in
&gt; expensive ways that require thousand-dollar gauges to diagnose and the
whole
&gt; Snap-On tool catalog to fix) you'll think to yourself, &quot;I could have fixed
&gt; this for fifty bucks with a 13mm combination wrench if I'd have kept my
&gt; Bus.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; When you find out what antifreeze costs, and what you have to do to get
rid
&gt; of the old stuff at yearly antifreeze changing time, you'll think to
&gt; yourself, &quot;I didn't have any of these problems with the Bus.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; When you go to Home Depot and pick out six sheets of drywall, four rolls
of
&gt; insulation, a bag of mud mix and the rest of the stuff you need to build
the
&gt; new storage room in the basement, then realize as you're standing in line
&gt; that all that stuff isn't going to fit in the Honda Civic you're driving
&gt; now...
&gt;
&gt; And I never heard of a High Country Oldsmobile Festival, or Toyotas
Nowhere
&gt; Near the Arch.
