&lt;&lt; If I purchase a new muffler and take it to Midas. Wouldn't it be as simple

as them removing the rear bumper, cutting of the old one and welding

the new one on? Or is it not as simple as it appears?


TIA

My main objection to Midas (and most other &quot;chain&quot; systems) is the lack
of competence at the installer end. That (coupled with the fact that a 
bus probably hasn't been in your Midas shop in how long?), usually means
some guy is gonna be learning on your vehicle...I'd almost bet that some-
body on the list can recommend another VW-familiar mechanic in your
locale...
