Subject: z-bed info

Due to the OVERWHELMING response to my initial search for the folks who
needed a z-bed, I have decided that many may be interested....
I have the wood and hardware for one 77 zbed for sale.  It will be easy
to ship...not necessarily cheap!  Highest bidder  :0
For all of the Bob Villa's of the VW world...I will post when I have
completed measuring the entire arrangement...sorry, no blueprints will be
available :)
