&gt; I've had the door buzzer relay removed since last July because it was
&gt; driving me nuts. Last week I locked my keys in the bus which probably
&gt; would have been avoided by the buzz. Today I left the lights and an
&gt; almost didn't have enough battery left to turn the engine over.
&gt;
&gt; It got me thinking that it would be handy to re-use the buzzer as a
&gt; warning for the lights.
&gt;
&gt; A - key in
&gt; B - door ajar
&gt; C - lights on
&gt;
&gt; Here's the logic that would activate the buzzer:
&gt;
&gt; (Key in and door ajar) or (Key out and lights on) == (AB + A'C).
&gt;
&gt; I can figure out where to get these &quot;signals&quot; from the wiring diagram
&gt; but I don't know in what minimal way I can build this trigger.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas from the electronics/electrical folks out there?

I don't have the wiring diagram for a Bus in front of me, but the
connections should be pretty simple. I initially was thinking a single
relay and a pair of diodes would do the trick, but that would have the
buzzer active anytime the lights are on or the key is in, so that is
certainly not what you want :)


Right now, you probably have something like this:

+12VDC &lt;----|buzzer|-------|door switches|--+
                                            |
Ground &lt;------------------------------------+


I was initially thinking of something like this (which won't work):

+12VDC &lt;----|buzzer|----+--|door switches|--+
                        |                   |
Relay normally open &lt;---+                   |
                                            |
Relay common &lt;------------------------------+
                                            |
Relay coil (-) &lt;----------------------------+
                                            |
Ground &lt;------------------------------------+

(active +12V)    Diodes
Key in &lt;----------|&gt;|----+
Lights &lt;----------|&gt;|----+
                         |
Relay coil (+) &lt;---------+


What would be ideal are logic gates. Using gate ICs isn't really possible
due to unregulated and electronically noisy 12VDC. The best solution is
probably going to involve a relay and some FET type transistors. I'd have
to think about that one before I could come up with something, and then I
don't think I could make out a simple ASCII diagram for it.
