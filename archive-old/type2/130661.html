Subject: Re: [T2] quality of rotors and calipers?

I used to work at Advance Auto back when we were saving money to buy our first house. 

STAY AWAY from the white box rotors and calipers. &lt;grin!&gt; 

Fellow brought in a 250K mile Mitsubishi Mighty Max rotor and a caliper. The new caliper was thinner than his old rotor which was too thin to turn... I bought a set for my Accord and they warped REALLY fast (3 months?). I live in a flat town so I wasn't exactly overheating the rotors... Most of my driving was below 50 mph and not more than a few miles in any direction... 

If you do buy the white box (aka Made in the Republik of China - R.O.C.) check all the specs with a caliper. 

I'd buy from a list supplier, the price isn't going to be much different than local good parts and they will be good parts.
