Subject: Engine cut out
Message-ID: &lt;378358C7.D72EB9F5_at_microserve_dot_net&gt;

I was wondering if anyone else out there has had this problem.  I was
driving on a major interstate over the 4th of July weekend and became
stuck in a traffic jam due to an accident.
I was driving my 1973 Westy and outside temp was in the 95 degree mark.
after crawling for approximately35-40 mins, the engine began to cut out
and then died completely.  I was unable to get it restarted and had to
coast to the side of the road.  After checking everything I could, and
having rescue personnel and the state police stop, I finally consented
to having a tow truck called.  Tow truck arrived and he started to go
over everything that he could think of that went wrong.\
After sitting for maybe 30-45 mins, I turned over the engine and it
started and I didn't have any further problems.  Vehicle ran fine.
What do yoiu think happend?  Overheated?  Vapor lock?  When it would't
start, it would turn over but did.'t seem to be getting any fuel.  Is
there some sort fo safety feature built in that cuts out the engine if
the temp gets too high?  I know the engine wasn't cooling properly due
to being stuck in traffic.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
