Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

Hey Folks,
Just a minute to interrupt your busy schedule, for a brief announcement on
Dixie Bus Gathering in Central Ohio on August 11, 2005.
We are going back to the basics, and we will camp.  We will eat well, with
the FMBC breakfast  burrito, and a big chili dinner Saturday evening.
Saturday am there will be a cara bus to a LARGE VW show.

This site is awesome...large swimming lake for the family, playground.
Wonderful restroom and shower facilities.  We have had this event 4 years
now, and have received rave reviews on the venue.

If you are into VW shows, or into an absolute wonderful FAMILY adventure, or
into VW comradare, come to Dixie Bus Gathering.

Follow this link for information....  www.geocities_dot_com/dixie_bus_gathering



Make it a Great Day!!
