Subject: Re: [T2] Seeking a side step support

Hey Frank,
Why don't you you just go have them welded up?

No big deal, and not an expensive operation.

Grind the welds smooth, sand and polish them--they'll be better than
new.


    
 
Hello All, 
I have an aluminum side step, with the cast aluminum side support
attachments (what enters the jack point) and mine are cracked. Looking
for anyone in a similar situation that would have one bad as well that
is willing to part with. 
Kind Regards, 
Frank E Biffath III
