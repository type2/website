Subject: oil leak and dipstick on '71 engine?

Greetings, all.  I've got a '71 engine that--no, seriously now--leaks a
little oil.  The previous owner had the engine thrown rather quickly back
into the bus after the SB engine he'd put in got fried.  Shortly
thereafter it came into my hands [point being: I'm not sure what all's
happened to it before I got it]. It dripped a lot at first, but I simply
checked every bolt I could find, and it quit dripping, which the neighbors
appreciated. 

But it still leaks a little onto the tin around the main pulley,
collecting slightly in the well under the pulley after several days.  I've
been trying to watch how fast I use oil, to get a sense of how big this
leak is, but I haven't been driving that much lately [see recent posts,
re: carb], so I'm having some trouble pinning that down.  [This is also
the first vehicle I've ever owned that relied on smell and sound instead
of guages.] What are the most likely places to be suspicious of here?  And
how big a risk am I running while it's doing this? 

The attempt to closely follow oil usage is also hampered by its new trick: 
The oil line on the dipstick is a few mm above the fill line and stays
there. 

I've been careful not to add oil until it got to the fill mark, and then
to add a full quart, so I don't think I've overfilled it.  [The last time
I added was several weeks ago, and it's had light usage-- maybe 400 city
miles--since then.] On the other hand, I do keep the thing parked on a
hill, usually pointed uphill.  [I'm in Portland OR; the nearest level
place to park is 30 miles away.] Could that be what's happening here? 

Any advice would be welcome.  Thanks in advance.
