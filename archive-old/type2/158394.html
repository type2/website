Subject: 3 yr old getting into bus

Hi Don et al (writing from mail2web_dot_com) - re your bus and toddler getting
in- our now 21 yr old daughter literally grew up with our 78 Camper You
probably saw it on
http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin  and you can see daughter's 75
(follow her link) on
http://www.geocities_dot_com/the_fider  We will be at both Everybus and High
Country.
Easiest thing is just to have a stepstool you make/buy and place it on the
ground for your child to step on.  Best if he/she can also sit on it around
the camp.  You can also make your own box/stool that could fit between the
front seats and have cupholders (Bus Depot's folding ones are great and
mount to the side) attached to it and have the top flip up for garbage or
storage.
   BTW, if you are using a child seat/booster seat, I traveled alone with
her using the front passenger seat flipped around and installed a lap belt
(going backwards) to hold the seat.  Justr as strong as any other seat and
safest option if you want to be next to your child.
