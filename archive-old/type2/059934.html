Subject: Dead engine No. 4 and insurmountable VW frustration

&gt; You tell a very good story that has an unhappy ending and it's definitely
&gt; too far to bring your bus to the Pacific Northwest.  There's a really cool
&gt; cliff (about 1500') up at a place called &quot;Bald Mtn. out here. :)

Thanks, but my driveway teeters on the edge of a perfectly good one as it
is.. Much less effort involved on my part, as only gravitational realities
must take effect-

&gt; Seriously tho, there are other conditions that could cause your Bus to
&gt; &quot;seem&quot; to lose power, other than a motor. (optimist here)  Brakes and/or
&gt; big wheel bearing seizes from overheating?  

Nope, the sucker coasts like a graphite-lubed soap box car.  And the
brakes? Only &quot;dreamy&quot; can describe their operation since the recent
renewal.  This only happened with the car in gear, and is identical to the
last engine's bearing meltdown.

I am beginning to see the end of my days as a VW owner.  Time and
motivation in short supply, my frustration levels are reached with
increasing ease.  I have spent well over twice what I paid for this thing
keeping it on the road over the past 2.5 years, and I have only really
gotten to enjoy it for about nine months of this time period. And yes, it
was running when I bought it.  Quite serviceable, in fact.

Maybe someday when I have more free time (and a longer fuse) I'll
appreciate it more.  I know that my wife and my dog would be much happer
not hearing tools against cinder block and random obscenities emenating
from the basement.

As the old man says, &quot;What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.&quot; 

Or maybe just wiser...

P.S.- I went sailing Saturday for the first time.  Did you know that small
sailboats have ABSOLUTELY NO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS OF ANY SHAPE OR SIZE?!  I
was unaware of this fact.  It seems to work with a bunch of ropes and big
pieces of cloth and the wind just pushes it around or something.  And if
the wind quits? PADDLES! Now there's some engineering. &lt;vent OFF&gt; /BS
