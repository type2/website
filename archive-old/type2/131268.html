Subject: Re: [T2] Track Roller Question

Are you talking about the metal rollers that the wood slats scoot on?

While on the subject, did the Westies ship with 2 wood panels or three? It
seems to me there should be three, but mine has 2.

&gt; Hey Ron,
&gt; I was wondering if you carry or know where to purchase the
&gt; slide roller units that were used in the Straight Pop Top
&gt; Campers like are commonly seen in the Rivieras.
