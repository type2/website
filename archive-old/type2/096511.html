Tony,

Check out the schedule 40 pvc fittings at your local
LOwe's or Home depot.  

That plastic stuff has gotta be a tinkerer's dream.

I think schedule 40 will take some serious abuse and they
may have y's like you need.  Wouldn't be usrprised if mcmastercarr had 
some good replacements as well.  Those people are amazing!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; 
&gt; Just curious, has anyone come up with a really good replacement
&gt; for the &quot;Y&quot; that joins the heat exchanger tubes to the central
&gt; tube...? This seems (!) to be a weak point in the system and al-
&gt; most always rusted and held together by whatever's left of the
&gt; factory &quot;insulation&quot; on many/most of the vans I've seen.
