&gt;Just wondering how well, dellorto 36mm on a 2.0l bus engine should run in

Should run very well.

&gt;I have pulled them to check my rebuild from
&gt;the summer. I have been getting popping out the exhaust at idle, so I checked
&gt;by adjusting the mixture screw, all cylinder changed except #2, so I 
&gt;pulled the
&gt;idle jet and it is not plugged, anyone have an idea what to do next

Check compression in that cylinder.  Maybe you have a tight exhaust valve.
If all else fails, sell those carbs to me.  :-)
