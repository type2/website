Subject: Blaupunkt Radio wiring?

Hello,

I have a blaupunkt am/fm radio I would like to install it in my 72 van (it 
seems correct for the period).

However, all I have are about two inches of cut wire coming out form the 
back of the radio that should go to the speaker. I can tell because of the 
picture on the back of the radio. I can see where the ground wire should 
attach, it is the male connector sticking out close to the antenna hole.

I am not sure where the wire that shows &quot;+12V&quot; should go. I imagine that 
goes to the fuse box? But which fuse is best to use? Bentley's manual is not 
helpful.  I have also heard that the wire that goes to the fuse box should 
have an inline fuse. Is this correct? and if so, what size fuse? Also 
perpendicular to the &quot;12V&quot; connector is a very small connector, I have no 
idea what that is for?

Finally, should the radio reside in some type of bracket? or is the bolt and 
nut sticking out the back meant to be used as a support?

Any assistance is greatly appreciated I would hate to fry this radio.


Thanks, in advance for your assistance, Phil.
