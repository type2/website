Subject: Re: Loctite 574 for case hardware?
Message-ID: &lt;7k76ul$u6cu_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Read Bentley, use factory gaskets, seals and sealants. Follow procedures.

Why does 574 work so well for case halves? Because is was designed by 
Locktite, Germany, under contract to Porsche for that specific application,
just like all German gaskets, seals, sealants, ect. Experiment with after-
market stuff at your own risk or do it right the first time so you don't
have to do it over. The beauty of German machines is that if you follow
specification you get excellant value. I service 200 or so European vehicle
in my shop every year and I haven't used a single tube of RTV yet and I
have't had have any comebacks for leaks. Clean, straight flanges and surfaces
are the key. Don't overtorque.

&gt; Well I've waited against all my emotions to put the bottom end of my T4
&gt; together on the rec to get Loctite 574 (Orange) for the splitline.  
&gt; Permatex Aviation Form a Gasket that I'd use thoughout but I see AVP had
&gt; used some super gooey clear silicone that seemed to seal well on this case
&gt; before.  Weird stuff,  HELL to get off.  About the only good thing
&gt; I have to say Loctite high temp
&gt; silicone.  AVP also used silicone around the oil pump, no paper gasket and
&gt; it leaked,  I don't really think the anaerobic stuff is
&gt; appropriate there and I am leaning toward the Permatex not a silicone.
