There are two things I know of that normaly cause what you discribe.
The first is the Condencor, these go out and cause the engine to shake and
buck. It will seem to run fine at an idle and then only get worse as you
drive. Stopping to cool things off helps for a little while, but it comes
back. 
The second is only if you have FI. There is a Temp Sencor #2, it tells the
computer that the engine is warm or cold. If it fails the engine do what you
discribed, but only when warm. It will run fine when cold. Look in the
Bentley manual for more discription and testing of this. 
Both are cheap and easy to fix. A condencor is less than $10 and the Temp
Sencor is about $25-30 and easy to get at.
I do know that there are other possibilities, but these seem to be the most
common failure on a Bus. I have had both fail on my Buses. The best
investment you can make is to get a Bentley Manual, it will help you test
and fix your Bus.

Hey guys-

Thanks for all of your help thus far, I am beginning to feel more
comfortable with our bus. We went to run some errands today and had some bus
trouble for the first time since we bought it. Hopefully soon I will be able
to help people with their postings, but right now I need all the help I can
get!

Just a little background info, it's a 76 westy, we just got the valves
adjusted and an oil change. We let the bus warm up for about 10 minutes and
then headed out. It was fine for a block and then started shaking violently,
kind of lurching back and forth. We thought it was an isolated incident; it
has happened a couple of times before, but not enough to not feel safe
driving it. This time it kept shaking and then occasionally dying, so we
decided to head home. We kept it in a low gear, but it didn't seem to matter
what gear it was in. Could this be something with the timing? What is going
on?!?!


Thanks for all of your help!
Cara
