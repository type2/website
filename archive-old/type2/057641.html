Don't you remember your Bob and Doug MacKenzie?  Double it and add 30.
This is how they concluded that a six pack equals 42 metric beers (Six
doubled plus 30).
--&gt; actually it's: double it, subtract 10%, add 32
Only reason I know this, is because it's on the FAA Knowledge Test. I
am working on my childhood fantasy of obtaining my Private Pilot
License. I was (re)inspired to do this by an ex-listee who informed me
that VW engines and aircraft engines are of the same breed. Hope I get
a chance to meet him some day and thank him.
  Peace,
