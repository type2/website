Subject: Brake booster problem


&gt; On my 81 I have a one year old brake booster.  Recently started having a
&gt; problem.  When I come to a stop if i have my foot on the brake for a few
&gt; seconds, the boost goes away and the pedal is hard as a rock.then if i
give
&gt; it some throttle the boost kicks back in.  I have a vacuum gauge attached
to
&gt; the booster line, and when i come to a stop vacuum goes all the way to
zero
&gt; if i keep my foot on the brake..............
&gt;
&gt; Ideas?
