I wrote:
&gt; ...the last and best word on hoses to an external auxillary oil
&gt; cooler: Order should not significantly affect oil pressure (though now
&gt; I've got an oil pressure gauge and am in a position to collect real data
&gt; if I want to), so put oil filter before the oil pump, to keep the oil pump
&gt; clean inside... 

I should have written:
...so put the oil filter before the oil COOLER, to keep the oil COOLER 
clean inside...&quot;

Free advice and worth every penny. :-^
