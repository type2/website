Subject: Re: [T2] More Clap and Trap.... One brain

&lt;When I re-install my radio I'm going to put in a unique option.&gt;

My 4 year old asks for Car-Talk by name... Apparently they are right on his level.. &lt;griN!&gt; 

Luckily the Cabrio (which we travelled int he weekend) has a bum ignition switch that allows everything to work except the stereo... Got to fix it but I don't know if I will tell our four year old... 

&lt;grin!&gt; 

I've listened to them off and on for years. Easy to take them too seriously and it is hard to decide whether to take them seriously... Mostly I just talk back to the radio b/c I have heard some REALLY bad advice from them that I chalk up to hear-say rather than fact. They are certainly biased for certain brands and against other brands - often against cars that have been VERY good to me. 

Chris
