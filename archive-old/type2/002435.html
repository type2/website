		Greetings...

I have a 1600 dp (in a 71 bus) and am having some problems with extremely
hot oil (200 deg around town and if I drive faster than 50 mph 240 is not
uncommon)...  The timing advance is 30 deg. at 2000  rpms and 5 deg ATDC at
idle.  My fuel mixture is also right on.  Dwell is steady at 49 degrees.
Valves are adjusted at .006 intake and .007 exhaust...

		I have some thoughts on what might be causing this problem.

I have a semi stuck oil pressure control valve.. This is the spring loaded
piston that is located below and near #3 cylinder.  From the reading I've
done, I believe this valve enables the engine to maintain oil pressure on
deceleration, when oil pressure can go from 40 psi to zero very quickly...
Is this a correct interpretation of the function of this valve?

When I say it's semi stuck, I mean that I am able to move it up and down in
the chamber, although it sticks in various positions until I can wiggle it
free... After a bit of work wiggling a screwdriver and a magnet on an
extendable probe, I am able to get the piston completely out.  The piston
itself  is slightly scored, which I cleaned up with some sandpaper until it
is smooth again....  I presume that there are burs or other things in the
chamber that are causing the piston to stick..  I've tried taking a copper
brush and running it in the chamber, but to little/no effect.  The piston
still sticks in various postions.

Does anyone have any ideas on how the burs can be removed from the chamber?

And, more importantly, would the sticking of this piston in the up (that's
where it sticks) position cause the oil to heat up to dangerous temps (&gt; 240
degrees at 55 mph on a flat section of road)?

Providing that the sticking piston is not the problem the next thought goes
to the oil cooler.  Either the oil is not getting to the cooler in
sufficient amounts to cool the oil (piston)  or the oil cooler itself is
failing.  The fan is working fine, so my thoughts lead to the oil cooler
either being damaged or crimped somewhere, or that there is some crud
blocking an oil passage in the cooler.

So before I pull the engine to flush the oil cooler and check it for crimps,
has anyone had success with an engine flush in a type1 engine with about
25000 miles?  Or is this a big no no?

Other thoughts on this/these problems?

Going over the mountains is a real bitch these days...:)
