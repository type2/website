This is one of the reasons I've used a pair of nylon hold-down straps for
years on our '70 Westfalia [see archives for detailed discussions].  They
are inexpensive, do not impair the operation of front or sliding doors, and
can be removed or reinstalled in a minute or two.

&gt;&gt;  Of course, my 71's top resonates along the lower rear edges at highway
speeds - so much for the improvement.  I guess age has caused it to
relax a bit so that even with a new seal the edges don't _quite_ contact
the roof.  Sorta a bernoulli effect.

My temp fix is to put a spring clamp on the gutter at each side, with
additional stuff on it to push the edge against the metal roof.  Ugly
but functional - I just have to remember to take them off before
raising/lowering the top.  Ask me how I know that.  &lt;&lt;
