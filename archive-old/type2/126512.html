Awesome! Thanks for sharing that! 

I sometimes think only bus owners would do something like that. Why?
I've seen ricers go past a car that was just starting to smoke, and
they had fancy chrome extinguishers bolted to the windshield pillar.
It's usually me who goes to help. Even before I had a bus! I'm a
regular extinguisher buyer at WallyWorld.. heh (And this leads to
another question: Do the busses we drive turn us into nice guys or are
we nice guys to begin with and a bus fits our personalities?)


Every car I drive has an extinguisher. Even (especially?) the Fiero. I
even saved my wife's car before we were even dating. She had a Ford
Fairmont wagon (nice 302 in it) and was working at a movie theater. We
were 18. She had just pulled into the theater to go to work and ran
inside. I pulled up and saw her car smoking under the hood. I ran back
to my car, grabbed the extinguisher, when a total ID10T employee ran
out and popped the hood! I'm yelling &quot;NO!!!&quot; but he did it and singed
his hair and eyebrows really good. LoL!!!

I put the fire out, she was thankful. A few weeks later she repaid my
saving her car by showing me how roomy the back of a Fairmont station
wagon really is. ;-)
