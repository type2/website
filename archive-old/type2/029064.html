Subject: plate vs tube oil cooler

Hi Chris
The difference between the 2 is surface area.  The plate type coolers have a
greater surface area that the oil contacts, and also for the air to flow by,
taking more heat from the oil with it.  You said you are retaining the stock
oil cooler, and doing the tube thing as a supplement.  That's good because
my short experience with a tube cooler ONLY was disastrous (back in the late
70s - don't remember much of those days).  Smoked a real good running 1300
Dual Port.  Before you rely on additional cooling, the usual disclaimers
apply -&gt; Engine seals all in place, carb, valves, and timing all correct
etc,

Go ahead and install the tube of you want but if you'e serious about
additional cooling go with the plate type.  They're available from JC Whipme
and probably about every vendor on the lists.
