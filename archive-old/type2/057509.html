Dearest twobies,

I continued my California Sierra experience this summer.  Though I managed
to forgo the 1971 westfalia buses annual trip to Oregon by buying a 4'x 8'
trailer and travelling with the big Ford van that pulled it.  The clutch on
the van suffered rather than my bus.  

Part of this years fabulous vacation package was a trip back to
Tahoe-Donner.  The heat of the central valley didn't get me down until I
started the 7000' climb at around 6:00pm.  Even with all cooling systems
working well I stopped for dinner when the temps looked suspiciously like
they were going to hang above 210 f.  A nice relaxing dinner was enough to
cool the climb down to more comfortable temps.  The rest of that trip was
spent river rafting, day hiking, puzzle building, and just a bit of
gambling across the state line.  I've started keeping close tabs on the
fuel mileage.  The 1600cc, semi-hemi head, 6.8:1 cr, weber ICT's w/140
mains, stock cam &amp; rockers engine gets a consistent 18-20 mpg around town
and 20-24 out of town, the overall average is 19.7.  I use regular 87
octane gas and the timing is 13 btdc.

Another little trip was up to the redwood grove at Hendy Woods state park
on the Medocino coast.  A lovely grove and a nice drive up route 128.  Good
drivers mostly, people obey the &quot;slow traffic must use turnouts&quot; signs.
The brewpub in Boonville is a required stop for the fabulous Anderson
Valley Boont Amber and Poleeko Gold ales.  The stuff I bought fresh from
the bar was especially tasty.  I spent a nice weekend with my sister and
her family puttering around the campground and redwood grove and swimming
in the somewhat slimy Navarro river.  On the way back I tried the backway
into Lake Sonoma and discovered a rough and typically CA curvy one-lane
road over a 2000' pass.  No trailers allowed and car-top boat launching
only.  Canoes and Kayaks.  Had a nice swim in the hot sun.

For this years backpacking trip I started at Tuolomne Meadows in late July.
 This is an 8500' climb out of the Bay Area.  I got a late start and
stopped for the night at a campground around 3500'.  The next morning I got
up early and finished off the next 5000'.  The 40 miles up to Tuolomne
didn't run too hot since you're so high and the speed limit is 45 anyway.
The bus closes up nicely with all the curtains so the bears don't see
anything, even though I put all the food in the local bear box(except that
last beer in the icebox).  Hit the trail at 3pm and didn't see the bus till
12 days later after getting off the trail at Lake Edison.

The big winter of 1997-8 left the High Sierra with lots of snow, every
stream crossing was a wader, no rock hopping this year.  During the trip I
crossed the North, Middle and South forks of the San Juaquin rivers, all
were raging.  I attempted to do a high route traverse off-trail and ended
up bailing down the North Fork canyon.  Devils Postpile was an interesting
stop-over.  Iva Bell Hot Springs, on Fish Creek, is absolutely the nicest
hot springs just about anywhere.   Half a dozen pools scattered across a
large grassy hillside, each pool with it's own unique character and
temperature.  This place is so nice some people camp here for weeks.  It's
about ten miles in over fairly easy terrain.  Next I went back off-trail
and crossed the Silver Divide and summited Graveyard Peak.  The morning was
spent climbing as high and fast as I could to get away from the voracious
misquitos.  I ate breakfast at a 10,500' pass which was about the only
place they couldn't find me.  I descended to Lake Edison later that day and
ended at the Vermilion Valley Resort, where backpackers are greeted
graciously and offered a beer and a tent bunk for the night.  The owners
Peggy &amp; Butch cater to the hundreds of backpackers that travel the John
Muir and Pacific Crest trail that cross the east end of Lake Edison every
summer.  A water Taxi services the trailhead across the lake.  This summer
the traffic volume was 1/10th the usual because of the heavy snowcover.

My fiancee' drove her Cadillac Catera (we're a unique couple, '71 bus, '97
Catera) out the Lake Edison road, over 50 miles of one lane sinuous, steep,
bumpy and spectacular patchy asphalt.  Kaiser pass is at 9200'.  Leave
Fresno and drive UP.  She arrived after 8pm, more than six hours from the
Bay Area.  We spent the night then went over to Florence Lake and went out
for an overnight instead of the five day trip I had originally planned.
She hates high water crossings and the misquitos were really rough so we
cut the trip back.  After that we headed into Fresno for a night, then
struck out the next day for Tuolomne Meadows to get the bus.  The Catera
didn't appear to fare much better in the heat than the bus does.  Temps
climbed almost into the red with only the two of us.  We even turned the
air conditioning off to get the needle down.  There is no question that
climbing in and around the Sierra's in the summer takes alot of power and
produces alot of heat in any vehicle.  We got to the bus by mid-day and
ended up travelling back to the Bay Area on a Sunday afternoon as part of
the continuous line of two-lane traffic from Yosemite all the way to
Madera.  Slow people don't turnout, people get angry, 95% of all drivers
tailgate dangerously, fancy sports cars fail to accelerate on hills leaving
me and the bus awkwardly between gears and the line compresses badly.  When
I'm in the bus I turnout promptly and courteously and everybody waves
thank-you when they go by.  This section, with sweetie following in the
Catera, was not a great driving experience.  We found a nice Cocina and ate
dinner while the anxious line of boat trailers, RV's, SUV's and sedans
pounded by.

After the vacation was over and I went back to work I was somewhat amazed
to find that the engine got hotter then it had all summer in the mountains
when I came back from Concord to Berkeley over the route 24 pass through
the Caldecott tunnel.  That valley heat is serious.

Well the bus is contentedly parked on the street and the bicycle is back
out for the daily spin to work.  We'll just putter around town for awhile
till next time.

Sincerely,
Eug
'71

PS for you CCC'ers, consider route 168 east out of Fresno for some serious
driving and camping.  It surpasses even the Nacimiento-Ferguson road for
scenic wonder and driving challenge.  Once you're out of Huntington Lake
you leave the two-stroke personal watercraft cesspool lakes behind and head
up into gorgeous high Sierra Lake country.
