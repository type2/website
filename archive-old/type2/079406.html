Subject: Pedestal Mats - Where are they found?

I bought pedestal mats a few months ago. They appear to be a nice fit. The 
supplier I used had the mats that covered the top and front but not the 
mats that are found on the sides (between the seats) of the pedestals.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Ciao!
