Mr. Lyle's solution comes the closest to what you want.

One of my fond memories of my 72 Westfalia are driving through Savannah
Georgia in February of 90 in 45 degree Fahrenheit weather convinced that my
feet were frostbitten and would never ever recover.

I think that the best solution is a gas fired heater of the type frequently
mentioned on this list. If you check the archives, you will find anything
and everything you ever wanted to know about heating a bus. Be sure to check
out Mr. Bulley's article, also on the type 2 site.

If you do decide to use motorcycle gear, check the amp draw of the vests,
chaps, etc. before you leave so you are not surprised by a wiring meltdown.
I do not know how many amps the cigarette lighter is wired for, but I would
be surprised if it is enough to operate all the clothes you will need to
stay warm. Also, I have seen in motorcycle magazines these type clothes
advertised, and I would think that this would be a less expensive way to get
what you want.
