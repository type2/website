Subject: RE: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

I wasn't even thinking of mounting the heater core in the front.------

The heater box, with the fan, mounted in the rear would be more than
sufficient.

These things put out allot of heat, and used in conjunction with the
forced air set-up that's already there---Break out your Hawaiian shirt
and the shorts------It's going to be warm, real warm.

No srtain on the pump either--- running the oil through an oil line, and
oil cooler isn't going to do zip----

Later,

Terry

How long do you think that you could plumb the oil lines before you put
a strain on the oil pump? What if you mounted the oil cooler under the
rear seat in a Westy. Build some type or box around it and added a fan.
This would help with the passengers in the cabin getting warm.

Remote oil coolers would require looong oil lines in a bus application.
The ones in Beetles only go through the package shelf floor and the
cooler is mounted there, behind the rear seat. Even at that, I think
there'd be some oil pressure drop; and even more if you're gonna plumb
it all the way to the driver in a bus...I'd bet you'd be putting quite a
strain on the oil pump...
