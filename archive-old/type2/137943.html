Subject: Re: [T2] Altitude adjustments?

Hi Don,

Those carbs have a master mixture adjustment at the top of the left
carb near the master idle speed adjuster. You set it with an exhaust
gas analyzer. I wouldn't worry about it until you get to Colorado, and
make yourself a note of how much it had to be adjusted from sea level
so you know where to set it when you go back.

 What, exactly, do I need to do to my 73 with dual PDSITs on Sunday
 when I start hitting 5000+ feet of altitude?
 
 I hear re-jetting, but that's not really a side of the road thing. What else?
