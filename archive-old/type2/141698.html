Subject: Finishing my Longblock  but missing &quot;bits&quot;

So I am in the process of putting the dressings on my longblock and I  
find myself in need of a few things which I cant seem to locate  
through my web searches.

On my new longblock I was planning on putting in new Thermostat mount  
studs rather than pulling the ones I have from my old case but I cant  
seem to find them listed ANYWHERE. Anyone know what I should be  
looking for ? This is a GD case, though I think they are the same  
studs for the 72 up range.

Similarly I am looking for new studs for the Fan Housing, anyone know  
where I can get my mitts on 4, the ones in my old case are hesitant  
to come out.

Lasty all the rubber grommets etc in my cooling tin are dried out and  
ripped so I would need pretty much all the rubber &quot;bungs&quot; and such  
that are in the engine tin, anyone know where to find these ? I can  
still read the part numbers on some but not all ! The engine tin is '73.

Thanks for the help getting this sucker done.

Cheers,
Steve
