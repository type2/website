Subject: [T2] Re: keeping Vanagon engine cool

&gt;Anyone have any ideas, or know any tricks to keeping a vanagon engine cool?
&gt;I live in LA and it overheats and frys the engine all the time. I am
looking
&gt;for some ideas on what to do in order to make the engine run cooler?

First make sure your cooling system is working right.  Are the thermostat
flaps there and working, or at least set in the full open position?  Is the
oil cooler clean externally?  Engine seal there and all the tin in place?
If all this is okay then it's probably the timing.  Sometimes the
distributor will advance the timing too much.  Check the total advance.  The
T4 engine will take more advance than a T1 but there's still a limit.  I
like to run a T4 at only about 30 degrees total advance.  This is the
absolute max for a T1 but a T4 will take a little more.  The other thing is
compression ratio.  I like to shim the cylinders out to lower the CR to
about 7:1 or 7.5:1.
Good Luck,
Steve Elms
