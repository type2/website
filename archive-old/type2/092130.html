Subject: Re: [T2] living in a VW

Lived in my 71 in grad school for a year.  Syracuse winter no less!  I'd
take baths in a lab. photography deep sink.   Gas heater (Ebersbacher)
was handy.  I sewed &quot;Insulated&quot; curtains (aluminum mylar space blanket
within 2 layers of cloth), and had a curtain behind front seats and
behind rear bedseat.  These blocked light and prevented prying eyes. 
PakaPotti from Sears a must- fits between front seats.  If you can get
parking at a university (take a course), you can use their gym
facilities for showers, etc.  Instead of bulky Coleman 2 burner, get the
single burner propane that sits on top of the short gas canister.  Place
on floor and cook- warms you also.  If lucky, you may find a source of
house current if you can scrounge/rent space in a rsidential driveway.
