Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

Hi Jim

Well,, if the link I provided before wasn't good enough,, then I can't say any
more,,,,
other than no apparent troubles in my Vw ..... 
I think the key words in this spec sheet are &quot;inorganic borate compound&quot; ... 
what can I say,,  works for me,, do you have reason to believe the mfg. would
specifically lie to me ??

&gt; &gt; i did some research, and come up with a fluid I was told is OK for the Vw
&gt; &gt; trans even though it has a GL-5 rating,,,
&gt; &gt; 80w-90 Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI  API service GL-4 / GL-5 / MT-1
&gt; &gt; I thought I'd pass it on to see if anyone has comments ??
&gt; 
&gt; Who told you that? If this isn't synthetic gear lube and it has a GL-5
&gt; rating, it contains the synchro-eating additives.
