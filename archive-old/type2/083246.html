Subject: Leaking gas from left rear after fill up

Snoop just mentioned that this is a bad fuel
line.  I have this symptom on my 74 dual Solex
manual as well.  I already purchased the
appropriate line from Ron at Bus Depot, and
planned on getting to the job soon.  Now I plan
on doing before the bus turns a wheel.  I'm just
glad I didn't burn. 

Could you guys give me some help on finding this
particular fuel line?  Any tips on removing all
the other lines.  What clamps do you recommend?  

TIA,
Ray
