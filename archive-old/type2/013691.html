&gt;Here's the question: is AVP known for using hemi cut or semi-hemi cut heads?
&gt;I ask because the puppy seems to run best when timed out to around 36ATC at
&gt;3500 rpm. That's awfully high for a stock set-up, but in range for a

AVP step flycuts their rebuilds about 0.040&quot; for lower compression.
Not exactly what I'd call semi-hemi.  Looks exactly like a AMC head
when they do it.  A lot of people do this.  They tend to build a pretty
low compression engine actually as a rule.  As to 36BTDC well
I don't know the 1800 well, that isn't at all off base on a 2000cc
with stock dizzy timed correctly.
