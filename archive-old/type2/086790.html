Subject: Re: [T2] head (gasket) question

volks

    I have been having the problem with the 2liter engine in my 78 auto
tranny, someone suggested a leaky head so last week I swapped out a head.

today I took some time to look it over real good....only thing I could
really find was some material missing beside the head seat on #4 but no
hole, in #3 which is where the leak was.....there was some evidence of
leakage from the cyl... sort of a blackened area fanning out from a spot
on the head/cyl interface...no damage noticable on the head, didn't see
any on the Cyl or piston when swapping.  
  looking real real close it appeared that the thin metal gasket between
the cyl and head may have been leaking.  
.  is this gasket needed
.  where can I get em
.  don't you change the compression ratio if you remove em.
.  what about if you have em on one side but you remove em from the other

all I have are used ones and they are getting old..?????

O great and wise list....inspiration and guidance needed here

thanks
Bob
