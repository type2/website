Subject: RE: [T2] A Bay Window, a Lawyer, and the Need for Weed

&gt; And that is why I get the peace sign and the weed sign on an almost daily 
&gt; basis when I drive my Bays. 

There is a weed sign?  

I drive a bay window every day and I didn't know there was a weed sign, I don't even know what 420 means.
