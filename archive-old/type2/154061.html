Subject: RE: Inner rear wheel well, where to buy repair panel?

There is no such panel AFAIK. When I had to replace one of my rear wheel
arches a few years ago, I did a lot of searching (in Germany) and came up
empty-handed. Using the outer panel as a template, I made up my own inner
panel. A while after I was done a friend (who used to run a shop devoted to
buses) told me that he simply omits the inner arch by cutting it in a
straight line and attaching the inner skin to the straight area above the
arch. It seems that the advantage of this method is to eliminate the double
layer seam in the arch area where they are very prone to rusting.

I need to obtain or fabricate the inner part of the wheel well.  Has  
anyone an idea where one can be obtained?
