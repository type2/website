Subject: idle problem in 73 dual carb

hello all,
my 73 bus with 74 1800 engine and dual carbs has been
having some idling issues as of late.   otherwise runs
and performs normal.   was idling fine, albeit a
little low, i imagine about 800 rpm, within past 3
days idle has sufficiently dropped to where at most
stops you will stall unless you keep your foot on the
gas. starting bus and letting idle it barely keeps
from stalling and usually eventually will.  valves
have been recently adjusted, engine timed, cap looks
good, rotor good, points not perfect but passable,
good wires and plugs.   on the carbs the main idle
adjustment screw is turned all the way in.   any ideas
on what i should look for, man i hate carbs!  
definitely not my fortay, and any help is appreciated.
thanks all,
shelby
