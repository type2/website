&gt; &quot;Enjoy and take care of your Volkswagen she maybe the only one you'll ever
&gt; get.&quot;



uuh...I think you may have misunderstood my post. This is on a 2.0 fuel
injected engine. The oil that I am refering to is coming up into the air
intake distributor and into the fuel system. It has nothing to do with the
oil that is still in the sump. I just did an oil change.

thanks
Jasan
