&gt;Reinventing the Wheel
&gt;BY WILL HIVELY 

&gt;Nobody questions Jack Bitterly's brilliance. But is this reclusive, curmudgeonly inventor truly on the verge of making the automobile engine 
obsolete?

Wow! Each flywheel weighs 80 lbs (50 of it's in the flywheel). 16 units 
can power a car for 300 miles (850 to 1250 lbs total weight)... and 
develope 800 HP! That's about the same weight as in a battery pack, and 
I'll bet the car could be produced for less than the $30K GM is talking 
about for their runabouts.

Just run it until the speed drops... then charge it up overnight (or 
quicker for about $6).

I wonder how the figures are coming out on the buses that are being run. 
I wonder if they beat their gas powered brethren by a similar economy 
factor... and if they have proven reliable?
