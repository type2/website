Subject: Horns......What else?

Hiya All,

Me and horns again.  I got my dual horns set-up set up.  Worked the first 
time I tried it.  Pays to study those wiring diagrams!  Right now I'm using 
aftermarket 12v horns on the Duck.  They 
sound............well...........pretty crummy.  Like a loud (very loud) 
Beetle.  I'd like a sound a little more &quot;bussy&quot;.

I'd like to find something VW in a boneyard.  I've seen the Hella kit (kinda 
spendy) and I'd rather go &quot;used&quot;.

Have any suggestions for horns with a buslike nature?  Eron suggested Fox 
horns a while ago.  I've been looking, but so far no Foxes, hence no Fox 
horns.  I know I'm not the only Bus pilot to have dual horns.  What did you 
do for horns when you went to duals?
