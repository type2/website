Subject: Re: ACTRON Garage Sale tools

ACTRON also has a compression tester on sale too.  

http://www.actron_dot_com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=cp7826.htm&amp;cart_id=6100463_
16801
$11.99 Seems like a great price (I have no idea what my engine compression
numbers are!!!)

Will this one work on my 77 2.0L FI engine?  Or do I need an special
attachment like on the 7827?

And I'm DEFINITELY getting the digital engine multimeter.   Any other
recommendations so I can save on shipping?? 

Thanks for posting that!

Get the 7803 at the local flaps for $20 instead.
