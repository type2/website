What if I don't have a spouse, is this like a manditory thing?  Do I need to
get one by next year?  Dang, I didn't realize you Canadians were so strict
with your campout rules!!

I do plan on going to the Classic in LA again next year, which is a couple
weeks before your campout, maybe I can find me a California girl to bring:)


&gt; Hi Rick,, and all that missed the Niagara Falls Campout this year,,
&gt; Buses By the Falls
&gt; It will be held again , I am getting a ton of support already!!!

&gt; Mark your vacation schedule.... tell your spouse it is a second Honeymoon!
