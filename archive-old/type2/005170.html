Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 recruits and Type 2 fliers

I for one think it's a heck of an idea.  We have a huge VW show in Ohio
tomorrow, and I should have done something like what you mention to pass
out!
Coming back from Indy last weekend, it would have been kewl to stop the
three other Bays I saw and hand them a flier.

No Baker, we didn't pass where I could have waived, they were all parked
along the way.    :)

Subject: [T2] Type 2 recruits and Type 2 fliers


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; Well it is Friday. I had a Friday Question. I have
&gt; seen many bay window busses lately in town. A couple
&gt; of these busses were for sale, some needed some TLC
&gt; and a one or two were restored, beautiful models. I
&gt; think that the owners of these busses could really
&gt; benifit and/ or contribute to the list. My thought was
&gt; to make up a Type 2 flier that tells what the Type 2
&gt; Websight and Type 2 list is about. I thought that
&gt; whenever I saw one of these parked busses in parking
&gt; lots or else where, I could stick one of these fliers
&gt; under the busses' windshield wiper. Does this sound
&gt; like a good or bad idea. I would like to see some list
&gt; bus owners from my own town on the list.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know what you think.
&gt;
