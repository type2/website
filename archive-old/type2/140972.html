Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Port Shape.

Steve asked:


 I have attached a link to some pics of the exhaust ports on my new  
 longblock, from the looks they are oval,which to me would mean that  
 72-78 style HE's.
I had initially been under the impression that I had '79 style heads  
 on but now I don't know. If the pics suck I will get my other camera  
 and take more.

 Please help me solve my mystery.

100% 79 square port. They use flat gaskets.
