Subject: tint removal

After unsuccesfully asking some local shops and hardware stores, I thought
I'd throw this out - does anybody know how to remove the window tinting on
my '71 Westfalia? It looks like that sticky film that is glued on the
inside of the window. How do I get this stuff off? It doesn't look like
the easiest job in the world yet...

Any help would be great! 
Thanks
Dan Curran
