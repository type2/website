Hey Folks--

OK, I'm going  to ask a stupid question, so be gentle with me, please....

I had to drop the engine to do some repairs and replace the front oil seal,
and when I measured the end play (even given the use of the largest shims) I
was still out of spec.  This is probably why the seal was trashed.  I'm
saving for a new engine but I want to use this one as long as possible.  You
can probably see the question coming....Why cant I just use a fourth shim?
 If not, why.  If so, why.  Any other ideas?  Just go with three and wait for
the eventual leak (which will ruin my new disk) or use 4 and put some added
strain on.....?

Please mail me direct, as I cant always keep up with the digests.
Thanks in advance.
