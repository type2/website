special thanks to Robert, Will Anderson, Joel Wilson, and J Barry Berneskis
for quick and helpful replies.

Alignment was necessary.  Had it done yesterday for 45.00.  Found an
alignment shop that has been around awhile, as I drove up there were two
beetles sitting in the lot, so I took that as a good omen.  Only took about
45 minutes to do, so I figure a dollar a minute, isn't bad.  Bus drives
fantastic now... No more Mr. Toad's Wild Ride for me.  Thanks everybody.
