&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen the new style birth certificates? It looks like they

&gt; Didn't someone recently post on the Samba about providing the wrong M-code
&gt; to them and getting an inaccurate birth certificate?

&gt; To me, if I have to provide the info, it's a little silly and pointless. I
&gt; want them to tell ME something.


Keep in mind that they don't have to do _anything_!  Considering VW's
corporate attitude toward their aircooled vehicles I'm surprised that
they even bother to provide &quot;birth certificates&quot; for us.
