Gentlepersons-
                       As a healthy antidote to the Harbor Freight/Home Depot 
tool depts., 
may I 'umbly offer the MSC Industrial Supply Co. catalog - all 4200 plus 
pages of it.
It's at &lt;www.mscdirect_dot_com&gt; or 1-800-645-7270. Their catalog is on CD for 
PC's (we
Mac's have to deal with the paper version...). Even if you never actually buy 
anything
from them the breadth of what's available is an eye-opener. 
                        Impress the counterperson at the hardware store by 
asking for the
thingamajig by its maiden name...
Tony in NJ BTW, they have hammer-on salvage removal sockets for your next 
trip to
                 the junkyard...Now there's something you didn't think you 
needed...
