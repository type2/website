&gt;Rumor is that an unnamed listee whose initials are Dave Schwarze has been

Hate to disappoint but I have the hydraulic cam.  I was going to run the
solid cam but I chickened out at the last minute due to lack of
information.  Since then, I've heard people say that the solid cam has more
lift and maybe more duration - next time the engine is apart I'm gonna
measure them (should have done this before).  I can't measure duration
easily but I can measure lift, and more is better.  Given this, there
should be a performance *increase* by using the solid cam, not a hit, with
the downside being possible accelerated wear due to heavy valvetrain
combined with a more aggressive cam.  Next time I will try it unless the
measurements really scare me off.
