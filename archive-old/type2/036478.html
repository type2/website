Subject: Re: Backing Plate Removal !?

&gt; We removed the three bolts out of the rear wheel backing plate and cannot
&gt; remove it! It seems to be stuck on a dowel/pin.. can I drive this pin out
&gt; from the back? Is it put in from the back or from the front?

Yes. All you need is an old 8mm [or 5/16&quot;] bolt 5-6&quot; long and knock out the
dowel from the back side.
