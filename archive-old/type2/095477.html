Subject: Camper and Commercial #7

 I just recieved 25 issues of issue 7 of Camper and Commercial. There is a
really cool artical on the birth of the Transporter. One of my favorite pics
is of a VW bug pickup with a 5th wheel trailer hauling a 1950 bus!  Again
these are for sale for 5 dollars plus post(approx $2.50). On the cover is a
beautiful silver limited edition bay
