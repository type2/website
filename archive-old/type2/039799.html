Subject: Cleaning out water tank

Hello all. I just purchased a '71 icebox / sink unit for my Westy (Thanks 
Pauly). The pump works great, but I would like to know any suggestions as to 
how to clean the tank out to ensure no &quot;nasties&quot; are in there. BTW - those 
iceboxes are a LOT lighter without the water in them. AMHIK - we spent near 
20 minutes pumping the water out.... the pump works great! We took the faucet 
off and it was shooting water 8 - 10 feet across the yard.

TIA
