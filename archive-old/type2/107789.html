Subject: Advice on interpreting my compression  check results on 78
  Westy

Two Questions I could really use help on:

1) Compression Check Results
2) Noisy valves

Question 1 - Compression results
=========================
I have a 78 Westfalia with original 2.0 engine at 122,500 miles. I purchased it about
a year ago and have put about 4000 miles on it in the last year (stored winters here in Michigan!).

I had a compression check by a VW mechanic when it was first purchased April of 2002,
and results per the mechanic were:  1= 100, 2=115, 3=95, 4=100.

I wanted to follow up this year after 4000 miles and just completed my first compression 
check using the checklist provided here on the type 2 list (warm up engine, remove all plugs,
 have helper turn over engine a few seconds for each cyl). 

I have a screw in type compression tester
and received the following results today: 1=90, 2=120, 3=115, 4=115.

The common problem from last year seems to be cyl 1 at 90 pounds. Not sure why the
others numbers don't line up with test from last year, only thing I am aware of is mechanic
has a push on rubber tip tester, not a screw in tester.

Overall the engine seems to run fine with reasonable power. I travel 65 mph on the freeway
for the 2 hour ride to northern Michigan quite often. I try to &quot;baby&quot; the engine as much as possible
and not lug it.

Can someone provide advice on what the compression numbers mean, assuming my numbers
are correct from today's test ? Any actions I should be considering ?

Question 2 - Noisy valves
=================== 
Ever since I have owned this Westy I have struggled with noisy valves. I have found that
if I overfill (at least looks like it on the dipstick) by 1/2 to 3/4 quart then the valves will pump
up and quite down. If I fill exactly to full line on dipstick then I can never get rid
of the clatter. The oil type does not seem to matter. I ran synthetic last year, and
switched to normal 30 weight last fall due to excessive leaking with Synthetic.

Any advice or insight for me ?

Thank you !
Dean
