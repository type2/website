We are all on the same team!!!  You just have a bigger wealth of info from a
forum that deals with the waterboxer type buses daily.

You can simply go to www.vanagon_dot_com to sign up for the mailing list.

Good luck!!

&gt; OOPS!
&gt; I was just privately e-mailed that my water-cooled Vanagon questions were
&gt; really not supposed to be on this list. Sorry, Since I have a 71 Crew Cab
and
&gt; I see others with Vanagons I naturally thought we were all on the same
team!
&gt; Can someone direct me to the W-C VW list?
