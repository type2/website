Can't hardly wait. I was hopeing &quot;Heinz&quot; (my '68 Crewcab) would be coming
along with us but, alas, he's not ready. Just thought I might add that all
the economy rooms (I'm assumeing that most VWbers are into economy) at the
Scandinavian are gone. We'll be at the Best Western in town (about 1/2 the
cost). Check out the travel Websites for other Solvang / Buellton motels.
If anyone is going in hopes of selling some '68 - '72 Crewcab drop gates,
I'll find you. I'll be the big grey haired guy with my large 4 year old
grandson (in his VW bus shirt) on my shoulders.
