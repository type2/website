Hi, everyone,
I'm new to the list and have a request.
I am in the San Antonio, TX area and am in need of a new engine, or a =
reputable VW shop to rebuild my present one for my beloved bus, 'Chris'.
Does anyone have any leads or suggestions?
Thanks for all the help I've already received by reading the past posts.
