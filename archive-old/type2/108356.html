{sigh} Connecticut...

When I was a kid we visited with my Uncle &amp; Aunt who lived about 15 minutes
from Mystic Seaport.  To giver y'all up there in the Land of Foggin' an idea
of the time frame, Mystic was still in the process of restoring the Charles
W. Morgan at the time.

I'll never forget staying with them in their colonial era home (they'd just
discovered the concealed servant's staircase in the kitchen!  Coolness.),
and watching the fog roll in over the lower ragged edge of the ridges below
and up and over the side of the ridge where their home perched.  Incredibly
beautiful.

The Seaport was a cool place, too.  From the Morgan, to the church, to the
WW II Japanese submarine on display, the boat shop where they were restoring
another ship (boat?) named something starting with a &quot;V&quot; (I think), and the
colonial-costumed staff and restored village; it was an excellent place to
spend a day or two.

We're probably going to be moving up to &quot;home&quot;, just north of Philly,
sometime in the next two years; so expect us at the CBAF one of these
days... :O)
