Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize  

David Bell sends:

&gt; The 'anti seize on spark plug threads' thread has been over for a while, but
&gt; I have a new (to me) wrinkle to add. I was at my bearing supplier today and
&gt; saw &quot;Nuclear Grade&quot; Anti Seize which claimed to be good for temps up to
&gt; 2600F. Now I haven't installed my Flux Capacitor yet but when I do, I'm
&gt; wondering if this stuff will hold up to the temps generated by 1.21
&gt; gigawatts of electricity.

It should; the big question is, can your Bus make it to 88MPH before it runs
into the side of Twin Pines Mall?
