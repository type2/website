&gt; Has anyone suceeded in taking these

Do you really need to take it off?

I have limited brake experience but I would simply take off the drum and the
shoes which will give you a lot more leverage and enable you to pop the
adjuster out with the tool of your choice.  It just rests in a cavity.

Save yourself future grief and ease rear brake adjustments by lubricating
the adjusters and cavities with copper grease.  I used the 3M brand:

After you do this they will turn with such ease you won't believe how you
struggled before.
