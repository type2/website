Subject: Memorial Day Campout in the midwest (may 25,26,27,28)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.21.0105111203390.7192-100000_at_westfailure_dot_net&gt;

hello all,

We are having a shinding here in Missouri for memorial day, all are
welcome, but lowered busses are *highly* unlikely to make it there.

Why? well, that is because this campout is for hardcore bus drivers only,
in the middle of a national forest down a logging road and no services
available. more details, pictures of the site and directions are at:

http://westfailure_dot_org/campout.php

Take care,

Steve
