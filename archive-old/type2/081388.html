Subject: carb and dizzy problem

Dear list,
My mechanic called me today and we took my bus for it's first test drive =
after the AVP 2000cc engine, German heat exchangers, SS exhaust and =
Bosch SVDA dizzy were installed. Problem 1: the original mechanical fuel =
pump was bad so an electric pump was installed. Problem 2: on the first =
drive the bus is hesitating at slow (&lt;20 mph) but has very good =
acceleration at higher speeds. Idles OK. Problem 3: some preignition =
backfires.
I have a Weber progressive carb, which he rejetted this morning due to =
it running too lean. The primary jets are 137 and the secondary are 145. =
Fuel is premium grade 93 octane.
He stated that the vacuum advance dizzy was causing the hesitation. It =
is at 8 degrees BTDC with 40 degrees advance.  He replaced my original =
coil with a Bosch Blue to no benefit. He is going to keep at this until =
he has the tuning correct.
Do any of you out there with this engine/carb/dizzy combination have any =
suggestions for me? Please......

I do not want to put my centrifugal advance Mallory distributor back on =
because of the suggestions of this group. I just want my bus to function =
well again.
Also, the AVP engine had an oil leak from the front seal. He is going to =
take it apart and replace it free of charge.
Thanks for your assistance.

Tom Adams
