Subject: Deep sump systems?

Does anyone have experience running a deep sump system on their bus? I have 
been considering it as part of my move to Florida to help handle the heat. 
I like that it is uncomplicated, as cooling systems go, and the increase in 
oil volume may help longevity. But, I worry that it will leak around the 
gaskets, that the weight is a lot for those tiny studs or that something 
will hit it and bonk a big hole in it or break my case. My bus sits pretty 
high, due to realigned torsion bars and BF Goodrich All Terrain TAs, so it 
would take a pretty big rock or maybe a speed bump. But I have never hit my 
singe quiet pack muffler, and it hangs down a bit.

Just looking for people with experience. The engine doesn't overheat now 
and I am also going to richen the mixture a bit to make it run cooler in 
the summer.

Chris
