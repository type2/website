Hi Folks,

I agree that aircooled VW ownership success relates as much to the owner as 
it does to the VW.  My Bus is the third VW I've owned over the past 15 
years, and I'm still learning how to be as attentive to the vehicle as I 
should be.  I got VERY lucky and started with a very good example that has 
aged very well.  Still, it's a challenge to keep track of all the current 
problems, all the potential problems, and to drive it in a way that doesn't 
cause more problems.

There's a certain Zen approach that I find works okay on some days.  On 
other days, I think of my Bus as a pet, a wife, and a child all rolled into 
one.  It takes a lot of time, money, care, and love, but with the right 
amount of each, it rewards me more than any other machine could.

Good luck to all who are challenged by their Buses, and thanks to all on the 
list who have offered their advice.
