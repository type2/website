&gt; anyone got a good solution on how to re-laminating your westfalia
&gt; cabinets, what to use, and where to get it. my cabinets doors are in
&gt; really bad shape and would love to re-laminate them.

The best solution I have found is to find good doors on buses at the
wrecking yards. But.....it has been a while since 76-79's have shown up at
the yards.....
