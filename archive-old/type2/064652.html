Subject: Re: RE:Fixing Muffler Holes

I've had good luck with exhaust system leakes (mostly pipe holes in heater
boxes or u-pipes) by using a tub of STOVE CEMENT available at any hardware
store- it's the white silicate goop.  By itself it cracks rreadily from the
vibration, so REINFORCE it- I use Fiberglass rope or ribbon for woodstove
supply houses; have also used to stuff for car repair, but it's a little
thin and will not last as long.  Wet the area, glop lots of cement on it,
glop up the rope, wrap around pipe several times and TIE it tight with a
knot.   Glop more over the rope; I've also wrapped this with wire netting
and wire. Let it dry slowly like at idle before zooming out, or it can blow
out the patch. My record was the 10,000 mi trip around country like this;
it lasted another 3,000 after that.
