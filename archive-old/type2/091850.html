Subject: Distributor Rebuild

Hiya List,

Is it possible to rebuild a distributor?  In this case a Bosch 205T.  Do 
Flaps or the online joints have rebuild kits for these things?  Or is there 
an auto electrical service which rebuilds dizzys?  I'm thinking that I SHOULD 
know the answer to this one, but I've never before had an old dizzy which I 
wanted to renew.  So, I throw myself on the mercy of the List.  Info?  Hints? 
 Suggestions?

Mike
