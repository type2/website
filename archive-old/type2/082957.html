&gt; I reset it to get 54 dwell and .016.

&gt; Huh?  You can't change the dwell without
&gt; changing the point gap.

That's what I meant.  Perhaps I should have said
.016 and it measured (54 dwell).  Several
attempts at setting them at 0.016 resulted in an
improper dwell.  


&gt; &gt; The idle retard definitely
&gt; &gt;worked.  With it off the idle was a few
&gt; degrees btdc.  Disconnecting the vacuum advance
had no apparent affect on the timing.
&gt;
&gt; At idle this is correct.

What I meant was that it did not show any more
advance at rpm connected or disconnected.  
 
&gt; &gt;So I began checking vacuum.  FWIW the two
&gt; ports
&gt; &gt;on the left solex are as follows:  the right
&gt; port
&gt; &gt;has vacuum at idle (and therefore should be
&gt; &gt;connected to the idle retard on the inner face
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;the vac pot) and the left port has vacuum at
&gt; open
&gt; &gt;throttle (and therefore should be connected to
&gt; &gt;the advance on the outer face of the vac pot).
&gt; &gt;Am I right so far?
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure you don't have those reversed?  My
&gt; memory is that the left 
&gt; port (slightly larger, at the throttle plate)
&gt; has vacuum at idle.  You are 
&gt; right though about where each type should be
&gt; connected.
&gt; 
I'll check again tonight.  

&gt; &gt;I checked the vac advance on the outer face of
&gt; &gt;the vac pot by hooking up the guage and
&gt; squeezing
&gt; &gt;to get vacuum.  It held it.  Same way with the
&gt; &gt;retard.  The advance appeared to shift the
&gt; plate
&gt; &gt;when I sucked.  Maybe not enough?
&gt; 
&gt; Did you notice an advance in timing when you
&gt; did this?

Didn't try it with the engine running and the
strobe hooked up.  Just tried did it and felt and
saw the plate moving.  I'll try it tonight.   


&gt; I don't have the specs in front of me, but you
&gt; should have *about* 45-50 
&gt; degrees maximum, which is the sum of:
&gt; 
&gt; Centrifugal (both lines disconnected,
&gt; difference btw idle and 3000rpm)
&gt; Retard (you have observed about 12 degrees)
&gt; Advance (at idle, difference between sucking on
&gt; advance hose or not)

Thanks again, David.  Your are hereby ordained
the King of Vacuum and Advance, and Defender of
the Faith!  In other words, I LOVE YOU MAN.
