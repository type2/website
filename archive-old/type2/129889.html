Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

Hi Jason,

68-72 westies used a sunroof body. The sunroof conversion was 
incomplete though... they didn't get the drain hardware or cabling.

73 westies used a one-off body similar to the 68-73 but not identical.

74-79 westies used the same roof, with a cut-out large enough to 
support a double bed upstairs. There is a flat crossmember across the 
roof that replaces the arched crossmember in a regular bus. This 
crossmember supports the midsection of the folding upper bunk. These 
westies also have a bulkhead behind the driver and a swivel passenger 
seat. 74-79 passenger buses don't have bulkheads behind the seats.

A lot of people who see the conversion pics ask me about the stiffening 
action of that cross-member... I think they forget about the plywood 
bed  up there.  30-year old 3/4&quot; European plywood probably has at least 
as much structural strength. I know for certain it weighs more than the 
cross-beam does. I think it's there mostly to keep the plywood from 
flexing too much if things get too energetic in the upper bunk. ;^)

Here's the hole that I cut in the westfakia, with the arched 
cross-member still attached:

Here's a test fitting of the 74 roof:

Here's me finishing the canvas install. If you're going to install 
fresh canvas in a 74-79 roof I STRONGLY recommend you remove the bed. 
It makes it a lot easier to get those last few screws in place.

You don't have to go to this much trouble to do a pop-top conversion if 
you don't need a double bed upstairs. For my family that bed adds two 
extra months to the camping season, so it was well worth the additional 
effort. YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; reinforcing bar running across above the rear folding seat to provide
