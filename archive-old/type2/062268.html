Subject: 1958 pick up for sale (in Norway)

Oops, I forgot to add one small detail concerning our recent trip to
Norway. Lene found this photo add in an auto magazine Motor Veteran: (I'm
quoting the text, so this is not my discription)

1958 VW Pickup.
The vehicle is in very good condition and has an original canvas cover. 99,
000 kilometers. Selling for 20,000 norwegian crowns (I think that's about
$3000 USA.?). Telephone 63 85 65 63 or 92 03 96 94.

I must add that the photo here look quite nice.
I believe there are five or six Norwegians on the vintage aircooled list
perhaps someone could go eyeball it.
