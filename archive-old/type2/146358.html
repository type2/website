Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

Stay away from the treated wood. Tis only pine. I'd go for the hardwoods. Stronger and a bit heavier (concentrate on heavier). Look for a hardwood specialist. The local place is half-price when compared to Lowe's or Home Depot. When I was in the Navy teak was used where rot resistant wood was required. Maybe you can epoxy the new wood in place. I know in replacing wood in the old Fords (Model A, Model T) no one uses pine. Always oak or some other hardwood. 

Side note I spent all afternoon yesterday making 10x10 inch posts with my chainsaw and a $20 gadget out of some hardwood trees I cut down a year ago. Should make PRETTY wood to build some furniture out of whenever I finish cuting planks out of the beams I made yesterday. 4 more 10 foot long sections to square up this evening.
