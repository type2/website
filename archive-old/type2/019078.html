Subject: strange crude in my oil?
Message-ID: &lt;38187E8B.10CCE9B1_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Hi, this is Beth.  My husband and I just go a 1978 bus and we are so in
love with it, me especially.  It has had its minor problems but so far
they have been fixable and not bankrupting.  However, when I checked the
oil the other day the underside of the oil cap was coated in this greasy
white junk?  Does anyone know what this is?  I had the oil changed a
couple of months ago but I guess I never looked under the cap before. 
We are using straight 30 wt oil as per our mechanic's recommendation.  I
hope this is not something really awful.  If anyone has experience,
please clue me in.  Thanks, Beth D.
