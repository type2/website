Subject: &lt;F&gt; Beetle Buggin PC game

Hi,

Found this neat racing game in the store called Beetle Buggin for the PC.
You race various beetles and also busses. Looks like only the early busses
though from looking at the box.  :-/ Looked neat and I ordered it online.
Haven't gotten it yet. Their website is http://www.beetlebuggin_dot_com in case
you wanna check it out.
