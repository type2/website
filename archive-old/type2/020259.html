Also if you seal the panels with plastic as they came from the factory (at least
in later years) you increase the insulating properties of the bus and prevent
fiberglass particles from entering the cabin,  killing two birds with one stone,
you increase the insulation value of the fiberglass and prevent the health risks
associated with fiberglass insulation.  this will also minimize moisture trapped
by the fiberglass (fiberglass is great for condensing atmospheric moisture) and
help prevent rust and increase the lifespan of the insulation, especially if you
use a propane heater in your bus. Its cheap, easy and quick(afternoon job) to do
and has definite benefits.  Also slightly reduces road noise.

&gt; &gt; We use Wool (from sheep) insulation, same configuration as fibreglass but
&gt; &gt; without the health disadvantages, only costs 12% more. .
&gt;
&gt; I have a suspicion that wool insulation is a bit more expensive in the
&gt; non-New-Zealand parts of the world!  Moths can be a problem too, and moth
&gt; balls (Paradichlorobenzine) are a greater health hazard than fiberglass.
