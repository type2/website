Subject: Heading off again.

I'm forwarding this. Reply to the author.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;        (would you mind posting this for me sans crap trailers,
&gt;         to both the vanagon &amp; type2 lists)
&gt;
&gt;Reply-To: W.Warburton_at_ed.ac_dot_uk
&gt;
&gt;        Sorry about the last message to type2 about border crossings, I
&gt;forgot to get it forwarded to remove the trailers.
&gt; This is another &quot;farewell for now&quot; message (like the one I sent out a
&gt;couple of years back when I set off for Latin America.) Judy and I are off
&gt;again- this time around Asia after a couple of months in NZ &amp; Oz.
&gt; Hopefully I'll get back online sometime next year, in which case I'll see
&gt;you then (probably on four lists by then- one each for the basic body
&gt;styles- with a raging argument about whether to split vanagon_at_lenti for
&gt;air &amp; watercooled vanagons to cut down the traffic...!).
&gt; We are taking our '68 Dormobile off to the South Island for a month before
&gt;leaving NZ. After that we'll have to sell it (sob) but I'll let the new
&gt;owner know you're here- say hello if he drops by :-). I heard that Grandpa,
&gt;the Westy I had in Scotland, is still alive and well and that the current
&gt;owner may sell him back to me when I return (a possible base for the
&gt;PorscheBus project, though currently lacking servo brakes :-(  ).
&gt; I'm sorry I didn't send off a trip report from the American leg of our
&gt;trip- It would have been in the middle of the bandwidth debate, quite long
&gt;and without much VW content so I kept putting it off and now have no time.
&gt; I would recommend anybody who isn't too uptight to go and travel the
&gt;world, it's been an amazing trip so far and well worth it. We met people
&gt;travelling with kids of all ages, mortgages, jobs waiting for them or not
&gt;and none of them had regretted leaving home. Go for it! The world isn't
&gt;as dangerous and unpleasant as the government would have you believe!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I'm preaching again, arn't I &lt;embarrassed grin&gt;. Thanks again
&gt;for your help, advice and support in all things aircooled. Hope to catch
&gt;up again soon!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;        W.
