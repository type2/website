&gt;like the CR is too high and you might need high grade gas .  Also does this

&gt;the 914  so it
&gt;is possible that you are setting it at the advanced mark

For sure, verify TDC mechanically by removing spark plug one and 
feeling the piston
come up with a screwdriver while verifying valves closed. Then you can mark the
pulley mark for sure. If that was correct, I then begin to suspect 
&quot;performance&quot;
high compression pistons or improper assembly resulting in excess CR. 
It will not
take many miles driving in this condition to lunch your motor.
