Subject: spare 80 - 83 vanagon engine, How much

I just found a vanagon in a junk yard here in Utah.  It has a complete FI
AC engine.  the guy said 100 bucks as is or 150 if I want to see it run
first. I have been looking for a spare to rebuild this winter.  Would this be
a good price.  It appeared to have all the stuff still attached. I think I will
pick it up just to have a spare FI and Air box.  My head says it is a good
deal and I should hop. 

Also it appeared to have a good gas tank.  I know these can be hard to
find.  I replaced mine a year ago for alot.  Anyone interested in me
checking it out for them.   My guess is they will be cheap.  I once picked
up a 76 Lincoln grill (BIG CHROME),  lots of other front end stuff all for 25
bucks.   Not the brightest junkyard but cheap.  Let me know directly if
anyone is  interested in the Gas tank.
