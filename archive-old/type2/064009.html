Subject: European 1971 Westy sighting

On the way to work today I spotted a LHD European Westy circa 1971 (i think).

Items that gave it away were the lack of &quot;reverse&quot; lights about the taillights and the fact that the tailights were different than ones 
seen over here. They appeared to be two different colours (yellow centre w/ red outside lens)

As well peering into the drivers cab revealed a KM/H speedo.

Two quick questions (ok i lied three):

1.Does anyone else know what other peculiarities a 1971 Euro Westy might have as compared to the more common N. American 
Westy's of that vintage?

2.Can someone explain how the tailights work on a Euro bus? I t appears that they are two filament or soemthing like that?

3.Has anyone else seen Euro westy's of that vintage over here? I wonder how rare they are? FWIW the camping interior looked 
identical to comparably equipped 1971 Westy's.
