First, make sure that you have a problem.  All buses sit nose-high when
unloaded.  You have to put 200 pounds in the driver's seat to see if they
sit level!

If there is truly a problem, the next step is to adjust torsion bars.  See
the procedure in the Bentley and resist the urge to slip in a little more
pre-load.  Do to to spec and you'll be happier.
