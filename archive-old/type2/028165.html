I got this note from a lady in Michigan, but thought I would pass it on to 
the list. I did tell her about vintagebus_dot_com and type2_dot_com. I know there 
are other sites out there or others with more knowlege than I have. Maybe 
someone can contact her or maybe a local Vdubber can help.

Here is her address and what she said:

Her name is Mink  and address is   minkett_at_zensearch_dot_net



Hi, I was recently reading your classified ad and decided to drop you a
line.  I'm in the U.S.A., in Michigan, and I was wondering if you could
help me. I have wanted a bus for years, in fact, I lived in one until I
was five w/ my folkie parents.  I have even owned a '69 Beetle and have
had some experience with engine work.  My boyfriend and I are planning
to travel the country in the upcoming summer, and I am wanting us to
finally take the plunge and get a bus. My problem is this- I'm having no
trouble finding busses for sale, but when looking at listings I have no
idea which type of bus is which!  Vanagon, Westfalia, Camper, Kombi,
EuroVan, Generic Bus, Type 2...(not to mention special issues etc)  The
list goes on and on, and I have no idea which is which, and no idea how
to learn and find out!  When I do purchase one, I want to make an
educated purchase.  But how can I do that if I have no idea what the seller
is talking about?   Please get back to me on this!  I REALLY appreciate
it!  Sincerely, Mink
P.S.  Here is what I want:  the kind of bus with the tire on the front,
a pop top for sleeping, and a little sink console, the sliding side
door, and a back door too.  This is what I lived in when I was little.
