Volks,

I am happy to announce that I will be able to supply the BN4 GZE16 plugs for those of you who wanted them.  I am even happier to announce that I was able to negotiate a package deal, and the prices are going down.  The 195GLS will now cost you only $18 and the GZE 16 (for the BN4) will be $25, shipping from Germany included (Sorry Ark!).  Unfortunately, nobody supplied me with a part number for the BA6 glow plug so I was not able to follow up on those.

Even at those prices I am not going to buy many extras because of the cost involved, so if you want one, tell me now.  I have a list of everyone that has already e-mailed me with a committment to buy.  I will be replying to each person on that list this evening when I get home to confirm their order and send payment instructions.  Those of you that only inquired, please send me another note stating that you definately want one or two plugs and what type you want (GZE 16 or 195 GLS) and I will add you to the list.  

I am not sure what the limit is on the number of plugs I can get.  On the off chance that they cannot supply me with all the plugs I request, I will distribute them first-come, first-served so get your order in soon.  I would like to wrap this up by Friday if possible.  I have to pay for these in advance, so prompt payment will be appreciated.  I have a PayPal account, which would be the most convenient.  If you don't have a PayPal account, consider getting one now.  The basic account is free, and it's the wave of the future folks - you will like it.  Otherwise, please be prepared to send a money order or personal check in US funds.  I will supply my address when I confirm your request for the plug(s).

One more thing, the 195GLS plug has been superceded by a new plug with a different part number.  For some reason, I got the 195GLS anyway when I ordered mine.  If you order the 195GLS you may get a plug with a different part number, but it will still be BERU and it will be functionally equivalent to the 195GLS.  Or you may get the 195GLS, I don't know.

Again, limit 2, no resales please.

-David
