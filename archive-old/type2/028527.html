Subject: FW: [T2] Broken AFM in 78 FI Westy

How do you open up the AFM cover??
The black plastic &quot;cover&quot; on the top is meant to be airtight, else
the air flowing under the cap is effectively a leak . But if you
have a broken flap, you have more serious problems than a leak.
Don't have any insight on new/rebuilt quality issues.
Good luck, sounds like it is time to warm up the bankcard.
Cheers,
Keith
