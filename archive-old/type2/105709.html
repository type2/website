Subject: RE: [T2] Color Wiring Diagram for 71 Westy?

&gt;I bought a VW shop manual that has the color wiring diagrams from 69/9
&gt;thru 76. There are 2 wiring diagrams for the '71, one up to august and
&gt;one after august. I will be glad to make copies for your critique and
&gt;send them. Of course, and here comes the shameless plug, I am sure you
&gt;would like to make a donation to the Type2 list. List donations have
&gt;slacked off in these hard economic times and any amount would be
&gt;appreciated. TBear

Everyone or is this directed at me? I donated last xmas.
