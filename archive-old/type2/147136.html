Subject: OK, I've decided on the Mr. Heater Buddy

Looks like this one wins in my opinion. YMMV but that's democracy! :-) In
any case, if anyone has a used on they'd like to move along because they've
discovered the next great wave in camping heaters, I'd be very interested.
Alternatively, if anyone has seen just a screaming deal on one please send
me the URL. Amazon had factory refurbs on for 54 dollars but are sold out.
:-(

Happy weekend to all!
