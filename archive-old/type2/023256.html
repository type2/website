So you set up both the VDO and OEM VW switches to light.

The VDO lights at 10 and then when you are really in danger the OEM switch 
lights. Then it's time to get scared.

For me it all about a cushion of safety so I can do what's necessary before 
I toast my engine. I know my VDO oil pressure gauge isn't spot on but it 
allows me to follow the engine's trends. Again a cushion - I know something 
is wrong because the pressure wasn't what it was last week or 10 minutes 
ago or it's falling fast. I don't care it the gauge says 10 psi or 70 psi - 
just that something causing lower oil pressure than it normally carries.
