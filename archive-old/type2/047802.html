&gt; (I just need to know what a bubble top is?  Never even heard of it.)

It's what some people call a high-roof, high-top, whale-top, etc. It's a
fixed fiberglass roof extension that extends the full length of the bus
-- like an ice cream van. On a 68, it's probably a 3/4 roof with an
external luggage rack on the top at the rear.

Here are some examples: http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/registry/highroof.html
