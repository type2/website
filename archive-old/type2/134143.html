Subject: Re: compression ratios?

Hi Tim

On 05/25/04, you wrote:

&gt; Can someone check my calculations?

&gt; Situation:
&gt; Stock '79 Westy,

&gt; Stock 2.0L engine. Brand new AMC heads/valves. Using a buret, I
&gt; accurately measured head volume at 57.5cc. Using a depth gauge and
&gt; micrometer, I measured/calculated compressed volume inside cylinder
&gt; (not head) at 28.06cc. Not knowing the volume of the piston dish, I
&gt; calculated the volume of the dish to be 15.58cc from diameter and
&gt; depth (6mm) measurements. (Does anyone know the quoted volume for
&gt; the piston dish? ) I measured the stroke to be 70.75 mm. I measured
&gt; the bore to be 93.97 mm. I measured the shim at the base of the
&gt; cylinder to be 1.14mm. NO HEAD GASKET/SHIM. From my calculations, I
&gt; get the following values:
&gt; Cylinder and head uncompressed volume (total volume): 576.24cc
&gt; Cylinder and head compressed volume: 85.56cc Compression ratio: 6.73
&gt; : 1

&gt; This CR seems a little low to me. Would this be adequate for a stock
&gt; bus? Do I need to flycut the heads?

&gt; All advice is welcome.

I'm a curious about another point related to this issue.

How does the above mentioned ration of compression volumes relate to
the compression values you get using a compression gauge?

One is volume the other is pressure, right?

The compression ratio would have more to do with how much room
fuel/air have to expand on ignition, right?

The value you get from the compression gauge tells you (vaguely) 
the condition of your rings and valve seats, right?


Sincerely,
