Subject: Re: [T2] childs cot(dumb ?)

In a friend's 71 westy, there are 2 cots.  One over the front seats and one &quot;upstairs&quot;  Mounted on the roof. Narrower than the front one and on a folding framework.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; ive got an easy one for you this evening.   i recently
&gt; got ahold of a childs cot out of a 68 westy and
&gt; decided to play with it a little and see how it
&gt; worked.  im not sure if i read it somewhere or heard
&gt; it somewhere but i assumed (i know) that it went
&gt; between the front doors?  well i unrolled it and it is
&gt; too small to fit.  where does this thing go?
