Subject: 77 bus won't stay running and whisteles

I just tried to leave home in my '77 bus with the FI 2 litre, at the end of 
ther block I noticed the wipers wouldn't turn on so I went back home and 
replaced the fuse.

When i started it back up it popped when it fired up and let out a whistle 
and died.

I can start it, it whistles the whole time, but you have to throttle it and 
it pops to keep it running, it actually blew a breather hose off from the 
popping.

Any ideas to help me get it fixed?

Thank you
