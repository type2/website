Subject: Front Axle/Engine Seal Bonanza

Well, allright, its not really a 'Bonanza' per se but I guess I've got
alotta good ol' style work to do on my '74 bus Yoda this weekend.  I'm
looking forward to it, just me, the radio and Mr. Yoda.  (oh, and The Force)

My question is in two parts:  I have received my precious front axle beam
from BUSted VW and tomorrow am ready for the showdown..I've poured over the
Bently for a couple of days now and have come across a question or two that
y'll might be able to help me with....am I really going to need the tool
shown in the Bently to &quot;press out&quot; the drag link?  I've got a pretty good
set of tools ready to roll but I'm wondering if I really really need
anything &quot;special&quot;, or should know anything particularly special that would
get me thru this a little easier over the   two  days I have to complete
this work.  I'm shooting to do this in one long day. :-)

On Sunday I would like to pull the motor and do the two seals on the
crankshaft.  Where I come to my other question:  Am I really gonna need any
special tools for this procedure?  Do I really need the pressing tools to
press in the two seals?  Do I really need the &quot;flyewheel dog doohicky&quot; to
hold flywheel steady during removal of the bolts?  I imagine that I should
have the &quot;puller&quot; to pull the fan hub off to get to the crankshaft seal on
the fan end.., right?.... These are all things that I will know after this
weekend, but if I could go into this with the right tools (before everything
is closed Sunday!) I might just get thru all of this in two full
days....perhaps. 

I'd rather not spend a whole lotta dough on tools  for this if I don't
really really need to, but, if I gotta, I gotta.

Hope you all have a great weekend, and thanks alot.
