&gt; I think that you'll find that the $5 temp plate will be good all the way
&gt; home. People do this kind of thing all the time and DMV has a means to
&gt; accommodate the process.

Buy a temporary permit from YOUR HOME state.  With your state ID as proof of
residence and a recently signed over title it would have to be some loophole
from the early 50's that would get you a ticket from the police.  Also
definitely have it insured before driving off.
