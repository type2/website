This is true on older cars, but never, NEVER do this on a new car.  The
brights on newer cars are so much brighter that they do in fact hurt your
eyes in the day time.  In fact, don't do it with older cars either.  If
someone isn't going to see you with your low beams on, they won't see your
high beams either.  It's not just the brightness we oncoming drivers have
to deal with, it's the aiming of the beams as well.  The high beams point
straight out, while the low beams are aimed at the ground.
