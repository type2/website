Subject: Re: [T2] brake lights or lack

There are differences in boiling temps?  I thought it was a change to lower
the absorbtion of H2O into the fluid.  Out of curiousity, what is the change
in the Mercedes 4+ over regular 4?

Don't forget to remind everyone not to mix their fluids.

&gt; Lordy, I just love the way that you get directly to the point!!!!
&gt;
&gt; &quot;&gt; Buy 2 new switches. Remove the 2 old ones and admire the crap in the
&gt; holes!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; What would we do without you!!!

&gt;
&gt; Well it's the truth:)
&gt;
&gt; I just saved the list a lot of bandwidth use because he would have written
&gt; back &quot;What is all this crap in the
&gt; holes of my switches and master cylinder?&quot; and then we would have a long
&gt; disertation about the hygroscopic
&gt; properties of mineral brake fluid and boiling temps of DOT 3 and DOT 4 and
&gt; the silicone DOT 5 and why I like
&gt; Mercedes DOT 4+ fluid [because I get it for free] yada yada yada :)
