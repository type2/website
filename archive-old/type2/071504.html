Subject: Bus in a Barn Report
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

My 25 yr old son purchased a '65 camper last year that had sat for 10 or 12 
yrs. It's in great shape with straight body work and a recent repaint. The 
engine is somewhat modified with a deep sump, external oil cooler and twin 
kadron solex carbs.

Due to time and money constraints, it's been stored in a dry barn since he 
bought it. The rear wheels were locked up when it was pushed off the wrecker. 
He has finally gotten a committement from me to help him get the bus drivable.

He had to work, but I spent last saturday doing preliminary work. When we 
parked it last year, we dumped 3 or 4 gals of fresh gas in the tank and 
siphoned it out thru the carb line to try to get old gas out. When we 
attempted to start the engine, it sounded like a rod knock but I was 
convinced it was only running on 2 or 3 cylinders.

I removed both carbs and cleaned as much crud out as possible. The smell of 
the dried gas as a tar-like substance in the bottom of the carbs was awful. 
Got it all pretty clean including un-stopping some clogged jets by soaking in 
carb cleaner. Now it starts on starting fluid and runs pretty smooth. I think 
the stock late-model beetle-style fuel pump is plugged up with dried up gas 
and that the bus will run when I replace it.

Two questions--

1. Got rear axle nut loose, but the brake drum is stuck and, of course, the 
adjustment hole is now where near where I can back off the brake shoes. Any 
hints about getting it loose? 

2. Checked one front wheel and the wheel cylinders are frozen. Will replace 
them. Did I read somewhere that the 2 lock nuts can be replaced by the 
later-style nut with the allen wrench bolt thingy?
