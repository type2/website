Subject: A new level of VW show.

Mark your calenders now for June 1st, Heartland Park Racetrack, Topeka KS.

This will be one heck of a fun weekend and one like no other VW event
anywhere!!

Friday evening starts off with camping on the racetrack grounds with an
option to see some great dirt track racing.

Saturday is the MoKan Bug Blitz, Bus Blast car show set up on the staging
lanes of the NHRA drag strip.  Swap meet will be beside the staging lanes in
the VIP parking area.  A HUGE raffle with tons of prizes will be going on
most of the day.

Not only is this a great car show, swap meet, raffle and campout, but the
camping area will also have a class in judging!!  That's right, we are going
to judge the campers and camp sites where they are set up.  Best camper,
most creative camp site, most &quot;lived in&quot; etc.  We can do this because
everything is together, no need to move to the show from the campout, you're
part of the show!!

We can't stop the fun here, during the show, the SCCA (Sports Car Club of
America) is holding a national meet on the Heartland Park road course and
will be running all their classes.  One class of particular interest is the
Formula Vee racers which base their formula styled cars on the VW platform.
These things are exciting to watch.  Your pass into the BBBB show will also
let you view all of the SCCA road racing too!!

To top off a great weekend, on Sunday around noon, the SCCA will let anyone
who pays a $5 insurance fee drive the racetrack behind a pace car!!  I can
see it now, splitties and bays leaning into the curves, drivers white
knuckled on the steering wheels, grinning from ear to ear!!!

Have you ever heard of a VW show with this much action going on?  This ain't
your grandpas sit'in show, we've taken the VW show to a new level!!  We hope
to make this a yearly event and want as many bus campers as can show up to
make the campout a huge success too.

This is the weekend after Memorial, so use the Memorial weekend to get your
bus ready.  

Heartland Park is just 1.5 hours from Kansas City, 8 hours from Denver, 8
hours from Dallas, 5 hours from Oklahoma City, 3 hours from Omaha, and 6
hours from St. Louis.
