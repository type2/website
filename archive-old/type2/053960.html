Subject: engine update..

Well here is a update my engine progress
Got the cylinders and cylinder heads back on an torqued
them following Wilson procedure.
All went well except for a few mishaps which I wont
go into, I'll just say I felt really stupid for what I
goofed on.
Engine looks good though, nice and clean!

I torqued the heads as best I could with my cheap
torque wrench. I think everything is within 2ft lbs
hope thats ok. If not feel free to tell me its not.

Got a question also, I got 2 new seals front main and
rear main. Any tips on installing them?
Do I really need a puller to remove the front fan hub
mount to get to the seal?

Alex,
77 Riviera
