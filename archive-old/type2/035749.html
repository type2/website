Subject: Winning design suggestion (was Porch light)

I got a lot of good suggestions from people about how to put together a 
porch light. The best came from (I think; can't find his original reply) 
Fred Stoermer, who suggested I make a bracket to hang in the rolled-up 
passenger window and plug the light into the dashboard lighter. Bingo!

I got the porch light at Camping World for $10. It comes with a clear and 
an amber lens, and I will have fun using both. Amber is always a kick, 
since in amber light Peregrine's paint looks white. WalMart also has a 
porch light for 6.95 that looks to be just as good. Wally also has the 
10' accessory extension cord, which I modified for the cord. $3.95. And I 
got a 1' X 3' piece of light gauge galvanized from Home Depot, from which 
I cut the bracket piece. $2.00, and I have a lot left over. Once I cut 
and shaped the bracket to fit over the window, I attached it with screws 
to a small piece of birch, about 4&quot; X 7&quot;. The light is screwed to the 
other side. I put tiny rubber feet on the back of the set-up so that the 
screw heads wouldn't scratch my glass.

I also thought better of putting anything rigid in the dead space under 
the poptop. Instead, when I sew a new poptop in a month or so, I will sew 
in a divider with a couple of zippered &quot;doors&quot; and some pockets. And I am 
going to use a combination of rigid foam and 1/8&quot; plywood to make the 
space flat, and an edge to keep things from rolling down where I don't 
want them. Fred also reminded me that I don't want to add gratuitious 
weight up there, because driving through mountain passes on windy days 
can be so, uh, exciting.
