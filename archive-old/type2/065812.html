Subject: Valve Adjustment - how warm can it be?

        I went to help a friend adjust the valves on hos '60 DD panel this
afternoon, after showing him how on mine.  When we drained the oil, I
noticed it was slightly warm.  This was about 4:30 in the afternoon, and he
said he'd parked it at 11:00am.  The rockers were slightly lukewarm to the
touch.  I told him we'd have to wait for another time, as the engine was
still too warm.  Was this correct?  I've never even tried to adjust valves
on a motor that hadn't sat overnight.  I think it was the right decision,but
I'm wondering what I can get away with...
