Subject: 1972 Sunroof bus - parts for sale

Hi have a '72 sunroof bus that has made the transition to a parts bus.  No
engine or trans or CV's, and the sunroof mechanism is broken.  Various parts
have already been removed, and the front window glass is broken.  If anyone
is interested in buying the complete bus, let me know.  If anyone needs
parts, let me know.  The bus is located in Lafayette, GA, which is about 30
miles south of Chattanooga, TN.  There is some kind of weard attempt at a
camper conversion in this bus.  No middle seat, but a closet/sink/water tank
combo behind the drivers seat.  Some body damage, but generally solid.  I
would like to sell in complete (well, as complete as it is), but will part
it out.  If you want it, make me an offer, it's time to open up another
space in the yard.

Stuart Neil
