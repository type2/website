Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l

What Jake is getting at (he's a friend of mine) is when drivers have
hydraulics, they tend to IGNORE valve adjustments thinking it's not needed.
While this isn't a proble in itself, when you adjust solids on a &quot;regular&quot;
or semi-regular basis, you'll notice when a particular valve is getting
tighter then the others (usually an exhaust). That sucker is stretching, and
it's time to replace the exhaust valves before it replaces itself and takes
the pistons and possibly a lot more with it.

A log-book will show you which valve it is, and if you see a pattern you can
head off a disaster before it happens. THAT is what jake is referring to. I
came to the exact same conclusion as Jake independently. Whether you agree
with this or not is up to you.

Besides, stock cams are great for overheating engines, other grinds out
there are better performers, and the engine runs cooler too.
