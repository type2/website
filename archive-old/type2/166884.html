Subject: Looking for...

Hi List,

Looking for the little piece of plastic that goes... GOSH I don't know all of the words that describe what I need.

The air flaps, that are linked together, via a rod on the top of the motor are held into the aluminum housing by a litlle bityy white plastic bushing of sorts. When my son was &quot;helping&quot; me move my parts around the garage, he picked the fan housing up by the rod, and both bushings (apparently brittle after all this time) broke. Anybody have those laying around? or know how to find the part number for a tiny piece like that?? 


Oh, if anyone wants to help me out with the nomenclature on this stuff, I wouldn't take offense!!

Thanks
Chris
