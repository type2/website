Well, that's probably right. But I think it's part of the evolution of 
a bus DIYer. The first time you do a rebuild, you don't measure 
anything. You say &quot;if it doesn't look bad, how bad can it be&quot;? And then 
you put the engine back in and start it up and the crankshaft sheers 
the bolts of your fan.

You ask the list how this could have happened, and someone replies 
with: &quot;did you measure endplay, and install the right shims.&quot;

And you think, huh. Endplay. Okay, I'll measure endplay. Out comes the 
engine.

And so it goes. Your standards slowly ratchet heavenward.

The absurd thing is that I am going to return this micrometer instead 
of paying out the $228. And the next time I do a rebuild, I'm going to 
wish I had that micrometer and probably buy it.

But this time around, I'm more interested in replacing my 
torsion-pointer torque wrench with something that accurately measures 
torque.
