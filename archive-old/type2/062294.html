&gt;Such surface cracking is normal in a high-time flywheel and is not cause for

&gt;the cracks will be removed.

&gt;However, there are cracks... and there are cracks.  Inspect the spigot hole
&gt;and dowel-pin holes very carefully.  ANY cracks in these areas are grounds
&gt;for scraping the flywheel.  Since your question says you are not familiar
&gt;with surface cracks on flywheels (often called 'checks' rather than cracks)
&gt;it would be wise to have the flywheel examined by an experienced automotive
&gt;machinest before it is resurfaced.

As usual, I agree with Bob.  Shallow, radial cracks in the flywheel where
it contacts the clutch disc are not serious.  Cracks anywhere else, and
non-radial cracks are serious.  Generally cracks like you describe are
caused by high heat, and can also show up in brake rotors.  The front
rotors in my Mustang never had any cracks till I overheated them on the
high speed road course at Heartland Park in Topeka, Kansas.  They now have
small radial cracks, but I'm still driving on them and the car stops better
than ever.  I will replace them before the next event, but I'm not in a
hurry.  Most of the cracks will probably be gone once your flywheel is
turned, but if not, don't worry about it.  The thing to worry about is how
the flywheel got hot in the first place.  Try letting the clutch out with
less throttle, and not revving the engine as high.  This will also prolong
the lifespan of your clutch.  I think I've had the same clutch disc in my
bus since I bought it in 1988 - it just refuses to wear out!  Which brings
me to one of my pet peeves - people telling you to &quot;do the clutch while the
engine's out&quot;, even if there's nothing wrong with it.  Baloney (tm).  :-)
