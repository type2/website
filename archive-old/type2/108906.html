Subject: For Sale: '78 Poptop Camper - S.F. Bay Area

(This is a repeat of an earlier post)


Hi all:

A couple of weeks or so ago I posted about a '78 camper that came to rest in
my driveway after a trip down from Washington.  The owner of the vehicle
(not me) thought she and my daughter would drive on to Illinois.  But, as I
backed it up some ramps in my driveway to look at &quot;some oil leaks&quot; it was
clear to me that that this vehicle wasn't going on to Illinois.  The owner
allowed how it seemed to loose power just as she was exiting the freeway
near my house.  My guess - and it's only a guess - is that it burned a
valve.  Anyway, the vehicle title finally made it back to my house after
wending its way from Washington, to Illinois, and back to California, so now
it's officially &quot;up for sale.&quot;  I figure I'd offer it first to the lists
before posting it in the various on-line classifieds.

Here's what the owner has to say about it:

&quot;1978 poptop Camper with a lot of love to give if willing to give a lot of
love in return.  Interior - Superior condition, and good canvas.  Exterior -
a few rust spots and engine needs head work.  Before engine problems, car
ran great - made it through seven states without a hitch.  Brakes are in
excellent condition.  Comes with right side heater box ready to be installed
and other roadside goodies.  I hate to part with this car, but I'm moving
and can't take it with me.  Great buy for someone willing to put in the time
and/or money.  $1,100 OBO.&quot;

I think she's expecting too much and, since it's in my driveway and I'm
selling it for her, any serious cash offers will get my attention.

A bunch of pictures are at:

and, of course, I can take more.

This is a &quot;tow it away&quot; situation, not a &quot;drive it away&quot; situation.

Thanks!
