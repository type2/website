Subject: [T2]Weber  carb/ gas standing in gaskets?

i checked my intake manifold gaskets last week and they were starting to show cracks so i thought i needed to go ahead and change them out...before i found mysefl with a nasty vaccum leak....
   
  well finally got time to work on MY OWN vehicle yesterday finally and when i went to replace the gaskets which i might add are pretty new.....months not miles though.. they got some miles on them......
   
  i seen that there was gas sitting in these gaskets as i pulled the manifold off....
   
  does this mean that the carb might be leaking gas into the manifold while not driving....?
  maybe the float or something&gt;??hanging up maybe&gt;?
   
  or is this normal....sitting gas in the manifold....
   
  also i smelt gas really strong before ever taking them loose or the manifold loose at the head....
   
   
  reason i ask is the gaskets being as new as they are thinking that the gas sitting in them overnight each time i stop and shut down might be why these have rotted out so quickly????
   
  76 bus 1800 solid lifters....
  weber 32/36 carb......
   
  thanks
  chai
