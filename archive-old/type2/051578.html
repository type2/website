&gt; Why do they have this? It just sounds like one of those crazy old state

It should be called the &quot;minimum wage job protection act&quot;.  Still, one of
the neat things about this country is that the states sometimes act

Seems that there should be a market for metal replacements for the lousy
rubber filler.  Perhaps one of the folks who have just purchased a wire
welder might want to try their hand!
