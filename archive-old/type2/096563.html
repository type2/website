Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Panel Part Needed (fwd)


There is a guy in England somplace that makes body panels...although this 
sounds like a standard replacement part there.

Alan Scofield or Shoenfield or something like that.

He can handle orders to the us no problem.

Someone will have the name correctly, I have a catalog at home, but who 
knows where!&lt;grin&gt;.

Pmail me if no one else comes up with the answer.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Type2 List Adminstrator!
&gt; 
&gt; I have lurked your list for a number of years, and have used the
&gt; searchable archives many, many times to help locate answers to questions.
&gt; 
&gt; I come to you now with a request.  I have seen you post messages to your
&gt; list on behalf of volks who are not members, and I hope that you will do
&gt; the same for me.  Please see below:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *****************************************************
&gt; Howdy Volks!
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine recently acquired a really cool but rusty 1968 Bay
&gt; Window Double Door Panel Bus.  This is a Panel Van with a sliding door
&gt; on BOTH sides of the vehicle.  The left hand (LH) lower rocker panel is
&gt; eaten away pretty bad with rust, to the extent that the track that
&gt; supports the bottom sliding door roller is gone.  He needs a repair
&gt; panel to fix it, and is having a hard time coming up with it.
&gt; 
&gt; He has ordered and acquired the follwoing part:
&gt; 
&gt; 211 801 672 D  Runner for Sliding Door, Right Lower
&gt; 
&gt; NONE of my parts catalogs show the equivalent part for the LH side of
&gt; the vehicle.  I'm guessing that the number is something very close to
&gt; that for the RH side part; something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 211 801 673 D, or
&gt; 211 801 671 D.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to verify both of these possibilities by searching the online
&gt; parts database at busdepot_dot_com, but I got nothing for either of these
&gt; numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I know that Busses in the UK, where Volks drive on the wrong side
&gt; of the road [;-)] , have sliding doors on the LH side of the vehicle.  I
&gt; bet that you Brits have access to these repair panels.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone supply me with the part number I need?  How about a supplier?
&gt; 
&gt; Since I am not a member of the Type2 list, please send your responses to
&gt; the email address below, or give me a call.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Thanks!!
&gt;
