Classy.

&gt;But it works for now. I'm also showing some fuel starvation symptoms
&gt;due to the Facet so that is going to get pulled out and I'll reconnect
&gt;the mechanical pump soon. That Facet can't keep up with dual Solex
&gt;carbs at 3400 rpm and WOT for more than 10 seconds or so, like when
&gt;climbing a hill or accellerating to get on the freeway.

Always knew it was junk but now I have a real reason to hate it.
