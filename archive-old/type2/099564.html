Subject: Re: [T2] compression low

&gt;&gt;&quot;I found a mysterious Clymer manual which covers '61-'79 buses.  Weird! &quot;
&gt;
&gt;What's weird is on page 198 of Clymer manual.  The footnote says &quot;If 
&gt;you've read this far, you really need to contact a competent mechanic.&quot;

Those kind of manuals DRIVE ME NUTS.

I would not have tried such an involved project if I could afford a 
mechanic!!! &lt;grin&gt;

That's why I use the Chilton's Manuals for late model cars or the Bentley 
for VWs.

This week I ordered the factory manual for my Honda for the same reason.
