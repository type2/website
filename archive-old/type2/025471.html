I tried to remove the fanhub with pulley pullers etc. with no luck. Went to
the archives and read about putting a piece of metal between the case and
hub and then tighten the bolts to hold the strips in place and then evenly
tighten the bolts to slide the hub off the crankshaft. Well all was going
well- I could see it sliding off but would not yet pull off. So I tightened
a bit more and the case around the crank cracked and then of course the hub
came off. So I just paid $400 (the core charge) for a, I am sure much
cheaper part. Any idea if the shop will want the heads or other parts so I
can get some money back????

On with cleaning, painting and re-assembly.

Now that I have no money - what is a reasonable price for powder coating my
tin (1979) and what is a reasonable price to sandblast exhaust parts. TIA





It's only money so have fun spending it (or breaking it)
