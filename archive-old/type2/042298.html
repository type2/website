Subject: Rough when cold(was newbie Q's)

Wow!  Thanks for all the responses to my earlier post.  I really enjoy 
driving my van a lot and it sure is nice to have so much expertise only a 
keyboard away.
I did say that my van(82 Westy) was running rough when cold.  Here are the 
details: first it starts right up every time but then the idle fluctuates and 
it comes close to dying but doesn't.  When I take off there is a hesitation 
in each gear until the rpm's get higher (I do not have a tach so I don't have 
any idea what the actual rpms are)
So...where should I start looking?
Thanks again,
Coop
