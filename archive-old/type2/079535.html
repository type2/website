Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheel covers

Go to your nearest tennis pro shop and take a look at their grip selection.
Last time I went, they had leather grip for a tennis raquet in 10 colors at
$9.95 a roll.  Each roll was 3 foot long.  I used two and now have the
fattest, most comfortable steering wheel.  They also had a variety of cloth,
terry cloth, and other materials from black to neon starting at $3 a roll.
Wal_mart or other sprts stores might even have this stuff in their sporting
goods department.  The part I like is that it is very easy to install, self
adhesive, and the adhesive that is left behind when you take it off comes
off with rubbing alcohol....  easy, neat, cheaper than a flaps leather cover
which won't fit your wheel....

Peace,

&gt; Hey Keri and list
&gt;
&gt; I don't have the leather cover info, but I was hoping someone had found a
&gt; wheel cover to fit a bus at a FLAPS? I checked at PEP Boy's per advice and
&gt; found 14 1/2 to 15 1/2 covers for vans and boats, but it didn't come close
&gt; to fitting. That's the biggest they had, I haven't checked at a truck stop
&gt; yet however, any way how big are our Steering Wheels?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
