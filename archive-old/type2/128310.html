Subject: Buses and Punkin Chunkin in the First State interest survey

Hello all,
This is just a little survey to see if anyone is interested in attending this event this year. 
The attendence has fallen the last couple of years. The campground that we have had it in the past is pretty pricey. Unfortunately there arent many choices of campgrounds that are close to the event. If we have the event it will be NOv. 5-7th. We have had as many as 35 buses but only had 7 last year.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
