Subject: BN? heater question

I'm not sure what I have for a heater. A BN4 or a BN6 (Are they the only
type?). Last summer when I purchased my 77 bus it came equipped with an
aftermarket installation of a gasoline heater that was mounted right between
the 2 front seats. The guy said that he started it once during the 8 years
that he owned it but shut it off because it threw off a james bond type
smoke screen. God knows how long its been since that was. 

 

I got a wild hair today and decided to work on the heater and get it
started. WOW! Lots of smoke! It started right away which really surprised
me. It immediately started making heat just like I heard it would. REALLY
good heat by the way. Anyway, it was smoking pretty bad. I let it run for
about 10 minutes but it only got a little better. 

 

My question is, is there a good writeup on how to service one of these
buggers? I don't wan to die in a horrible ball of death or carbon monoxide
poisoning.
