Subject: Re: [T2] Since were on tires again

Hi Dave,

Sounds good to me. I have colour matched the rims to the body on my  
westy since 1997. (At least I did up until I found a good set of  
michelins on black vanagon rims back in february. Somehow I haven't  
had time to paint them red yet.  I also paint the VW logo on the  
hubcaps to match the body, it looks good to me.

Note: Be sure not to get paint into the bolt-holes where the lug nut  
presses against the rim.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; How about 15&quot; stock looking (Rally style) rims on my 78 bay?

&gt; I'm going with the steel rims colored to match the bus and chrome  
&gt; trim rings
&gt; and hub caps.
