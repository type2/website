See everyone that's going to High Country there. We are leaving now
(6:00pm cdt) from just south of Nashville heading to Nebo, NC on I-40
to spend the night at Troy Wicals place. Then up to 221 to Boone. But
we might be late friday, troy has had mechanical problems in his bus
just outside of Ashville. See everyone there &amp; have a good trip.
