Subject: RE: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

Ahh, so it's NOT supposed to come out? But rather the old mirror arm is
suppsoed to slide INTO it? 





 From my memory I also believe this to be the case, hold the mirror in 
the right spot and tighten up the two sided &quot;bolt&quot; that is against the 
outside of the door.
Too loose and the mirror is sure to flop down at speed &lt;grin&gt;
