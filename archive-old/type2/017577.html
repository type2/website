&gt; &gt;.Do your other cars feed the exhaust
&gt; &gt;to the air intake before the air filter or after, into the throttle, like
&gt; &gt;VW does?  Are the passage tubes of similar size?
&gt; 
&gt; To my knowlege the type 2 is the only vehicle that used a filter on the
&gt; EGR. All vehicles I know of vent to the throttle body after the throttle.
&gt; The purpose for the EGR Valve is to shut down the flow during idle so it
&gt; isn't affected.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering if it's true purpose is to get us to make a $250 donation to
&gt; VWOA every 60,000 miles.

Steve:
That's not quite true: I've got a 912E Porsche engine (not the whole
car), that has one. It appears to be stainless steel, has a number that
starts 923....One could probably buy one for about the same price as a
Beetlemex motor. Glad I don't have to worry about smog laws here in
Iowa, ( motorcycle helmets either, if one is so inclined).
