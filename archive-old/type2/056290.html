Subject: external oil cooler on pancake

&gt; Who has installed an external oil cooler in their pancake engine? My
&gt; housemate and fellow Bus owner Stefan Ufer has installed one that taps
&gt; off from the oil filter, but he had to remove the left-side heater tube
&gt; to make room for the oil hoses...
&gt;
&gt; Does any one have any experience they'd like to share as far as sources
&gt; and installation details?

I installed an external oil cooler on my  75 1.8 engine. I used also the  
adapter for the oil-filter and with some trouble and some special oilducts  
i could let the left heater installed.
