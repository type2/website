Subject: Re: [T2] Am I on the right track??

Most Vehicles in the 60's,70's early 80's vintage have one filter after
the pump--with a sock filter in the tank---

Having two filters before and after the pump is OK--just twice the
problems.

One filter after the pump would be good enough, as long as you changed
it on a regular periodic maintence schedule.

Size makes a difference too--too small a filter will load up faster---

Pretty much rule of thumb--a G-2 Fram type / size gas filter wil do a
good job between required changes.

I was told that one should have an in-line filter between tank and pump,
as well as an in-line between pump and carb. So this is not true?
