Ok, I just replaced one of the standard sealed beams on my '74 (w/stock
alternator) with the Sylvania H6024XV, which claims triple the foreground
illumination of standard HALOGEN sealed beams, like the Sylvania H6024 which
these replaced (the &quot;H&quot; is presumably for Halogen, and the &quot;XV&quot; tag is for
&quot;XtraVision&quot; TM).  I was going to compare then after darkfall, but I
compared the light at high noon, on the theory that my eyes would get a more
accurate reading with less contrast.  By holding my hand 6&quot; in front of each
(I don't have a light meter), it was clear that the H6024XV was
significantly brighter than the standard sealed beam (in this case, an old
GE 6014).  A little digging in my box o' headlight stuff turned up one of
the older Sylvania H6024s (with its tain still intact, BTW).  A side by side
comparison of the H6024 with the H6024 &quot;XV&quot; showed the newer model to be
somewhat brighter.  I don't know about 3X brighter foreground, as everything
is pretty much &quot;foreground&quot; at six inches.  :  )  Bear in mind, the
comparitors in both these comparisons were older units being compared to one
new out of the box.

My guess that the new Sylvania halogens are about the same price as the GE
H6024s for sale at my local Advance Auto (formerly Parts America, and
formerly formerly Western Auto) for $8.99.  Cheap and easy.
