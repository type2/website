Subject: Re: [T2] Welding in new battery tray? Kinda Wordy (long)

Hi Tom,

&gt;I am thinking of cutting out the part of the tray that
&gt;the battery actualy sits on plus a little more.... I only
&gt;have oxy/acetylene welding outfit.

Shouldn't be a problem, especially if you're a decent gas welder.  The more
lip you leave the less chance you'll have of warping the surrounding metal.
Don't try to do long beads without cooling.

&gt; I  was thinking of drilling some holes
&gt;around the edge of the new tray over the lip left from the old tray and
&gt;plug welding the holes to attach the new tray.

Why not just bolt, rivet or braze it in?  You're going for function, not 100
point restoration, so any of these will give you a secure attachment.  Also,
most auto paint stores have panel adhesive that is as strong as welding for
overlap joints.


&gt;The problem is in prep for the project I cut some scrap sheet metal and
&gt;tried the plug welding idea. I cant seem to get a good weld to the piece
&gt;on the back of the hole! I am using flux coated 22ga. steel strips about
&gt;1/8&quot; wide as filler rod.

That's wierd.  are your surfaces clean?  Auto paint stores can sell you
scotch brite to go in a die grinder that will give you clean metal real
fast.  Why not use regular gas rod?  You shouldn't need any flux welding
steel sheet with gas.  Sounds like you're using arc rods.
&gt;I am worried that a lap weld would get
&gt;the outer skin of the bus too hot and blister the paint!
&gt;

Why don'y you braze it, which takes less heat, or rivet it or glue it (panel
adhesive) which take no heat?

Regards,

Grant
