Subject: Re: [T2] Hitch Question (Was: Driveway blues)

From: &quot;Chris M.&quot; &lt;busbodger_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; We built a hitch. Runs from the frame on each side of the engine (where
the bumper bolts) and then had two steel runners to the front of the tranny.
Also bolted to the bumper but not because it needed to.
&gt; Would not move for ANYTHING...
&gt; My test is bounce on the ball with your foot - all your weight. If it
moves much then I won't use it.

Do you have pics?  I'll try the foot test today when I go out.

This one is attached to just the bumper and the bar thing just behind the
bumper.  I couldn't imagine it taking more than a small load.  I was hoping
that someone else had one like this and would know what the weight was.
