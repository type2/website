	Subject: [T2] Hot starts

	My '70 Bus has developed this annoying habit of not starting when
the
	engines warm. The starter turns it over as nicely, there's plenty of
fire at
	the spark plugs, and there's fuel to the carb. If you get out and
push it
	bump starts easy enough and it'll keep running until you shut it off
again.
	So far I've checked (not listed in order) the coil, condenser, 

How does one check the condensor?  I'd just replace it.  If its not the
condensor, maybe the coil is overheating?  

If the starter turns a hot start kit won't necessarily solve the problem
either -- but it may mask it so you never find the answer until it strands
you someplace.  If a hot start kit is such a great wunder drug, don't you
think VW would have it in their parts book?  Having worked on 6 volt systems
for years I have become a firm believer that the VW electrical system is
very reliable when maintained correctly.  That means, above all, no butt
connectors when splicing wires.  Butt connectors are generally made of steel
which doesn't mix well with copper in an electrical circuit and you will
eventually get a buildup of resistance.  Introducing resistance into the
system is a sure way of inducing failure downline because everything else
has to work harder.  I've found this to be especially true of the &quot;hot&quot; red
wires.  The correct way to splice is to braid the strands together and
solder them.
