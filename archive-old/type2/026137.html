I have this same setup and I have every reason to believe that it's the way
VW installed it (eg the hose coming from the tank is the original one, it's
the only one I haven't replaced yet but I will be doing it very soon).  The
filter doesn't weigh anything but I've cable-tied one of the hoses to the
starter cable and this keeps it up out of the way.
If having the filter upstream of the pump causes vapour lock, why did VW do
it this way?  I haven't had any problems with it.

&gt; &gt; Is this a kosher setup? It makes sense that the filter would be
&gt; *below*
&gt; &gt; the starter, but I'm a little uncomfortable with it just swinging in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; breeze down there.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't want it that way.  Flexible fuel lines are used to make
&gt; connections and in areas where some flex must be accomodated.  Letting
&gt; connections dangle in the breeze is courting disaster.  Picture a rock
&gt; coming along and smashing that filter, then having gravity-fed
&gt; gasoline sprayed all over the bottom of the engine!  You should
&gt; shorten the lines and secure the filter in a more protected location. 
&gt; If the filter is light, it may be supported by the lines.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that putting a filter upstream from the pump is asking
&gt; for vapor lock problems, although many do it successfully.  If you
&gt; start to experience cutting out on hot days, keep this in mind.
