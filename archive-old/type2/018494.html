THERE'S A FUEL FILTER????? i dident think vw believed in such thigns, because
the bently dident mention it. where is it on a 72? im sure it needs to be
changed because the po never did a tuneup and was wondering why it wouldent run
and now i did a tuneup and it runs, barely, but it backfires alot when it starts
and it wont idle. also i havent been able to get it to start without pouring gas
down the carbs. im sure it gets gas otherwise because its almost started
without. im fairly sure the choke works. from my absolutely no experence with
vw, or car's in general i think the carbs need ajustment and the timeing is off.
but like i said that's just my guess, anyone else have any other ideas?
hopefully i'll be able to make some bus meets this summer.

also i dont think this is a good sign, i droped the screw for the points down
the hole for the oil pressure senser and i found it again when i changed the
oil. but at liest i found it, eh. no, the oil pressure light dosent turn on,
which when i think about it shouldent it be on when its starting?
