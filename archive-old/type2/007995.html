No apologies needed for the delay, I suspected you might access your email during business hours.  
I'll test the power feed to the regulator again, what triggers the power to the fuel regulator and when should it be on?  
I also replaced the diaphragm in the fuel pump with the same BUNA N material I used in the regulator, was that appropriate ?
thanks again for the help.
