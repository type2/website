&gt; i want a bosch starter rebuilt/new doesnt matter...

check the phone book of any decent sized city for a starter/alternator
rebuilder.  I have never bought a starter, I have all mine rebuilt by a
local guy who seems to know what he is doing have never had one go South
on me.._dot_usually one day service and a lot less than a new or store bought
rebuilt (which is what this guy does for some of the local FLAPS)
