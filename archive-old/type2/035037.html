Subject: California Housing Tag

While doing some body work on the 72 Westy I wanted to remove the
California Department of housing and Community Development Tag.
What was the purpose of this tag?

I also need to replace my front windshield and have not been able to
find one listed in any of the web vendors sights, any one bought one
lately, how much?

Thanks for the help.
