Subject: Re: [T2] fan shroud flaps

Might have been good that you didnt block them off if you have the need for
heat where you are. The booster fan on my bus doesn't put out alot of
volume. It seems that most of my hot air comes from the cooling fan while at
higher RPM's. While driving around town I pretty much freeze. Gotta get that
BA-6 running this fall!

 I thought about blocking
&gt; these flaps off and just let the blower fan push the
&gt; air for the heat exchangers. That way more cooling air
&gt; would be available to cool the engine but I am sure
&gt; those German engeneers knew what they were doing when
&gt; they designed it.
&gt;
&gt; Any way, Take care!
