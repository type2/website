Subject: engine fired up...success!!!!

I just wanted to tell everybody that my rebuild started up to today!!!!
It was quite a special moment for myself and the camper.
I had bought the bus about a year and a half ago and was slowly doing
different things to it.  I started on the rebuild back in March with the 
machine shop and over the last nine months worked sporadically at
putting it back together.  Very satisfying to finally have it running.

The camper had been sitting since 1992 and I'm sure he appreciates it 
also :)

Everything went well.  It initially had some trouble catching but it
soon roared to life and I did the 20 minute run (although I think it 
was closer to 30).  Boy did it seem hot!  But I did the dipstick test
and it wasn't even close to hot even after the 30 minutes! 

The best part is zero, zilch, zippo oil leaks!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And the 
full flow set up seemed to work great.

Unfortunately I didn't get it timed because I couldn't make it hold
an idle and I ran my battery down trying to restart it.  Just didn't
want to catch.(rebuilt carb)

What I'm really proud of is that I did this all by myself.  What a good
feeling.

I'll fiddle around with it this week and see about a few other things
before I can get it inspected and tagged.

Woo-Hoo!

Excitedly yours,

Derek Miller
