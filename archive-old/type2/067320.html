Subject: Re: Berg engine kit ordered

&gt;Okay,  so I lurk MOST of the time.  Every now and then there's a rare
&gt;occasion where I can say something useful.....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;After many years of dreaming, pondering and planning I have finally placed my
&gt;order for a Berg 1776cc engine kit.  I recall past discussions about AS21
&gt;cases no longer being produced and I thought I would pass along this
&gt;statement from the Bergs that is printed on the copy of my order...
&gt;
&gt;&quot;This case is made of the AS41 material which has a new alloy composition
&gt;consisting of 4% aluminum compared to the AS21 case that had 2%.  This AS41
&gt;case is more durable than the AS21 material used in the past.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;This may help put some minds at ease for those who are planning to purchase
&gt;cases in the future, FWIW.
&gt;
&gt;I was able to sort out a few technical issues with Clyde Berg on the phone
&gt;relating to cam selection and carb jet sizes.  Should take delivery in three
&gt;weeks.  Its like Christmas in November!

  What I would like to see is the &quot;Spec&quot; sheets on the 2 alloys.

 Here's what I have: AS100: been around for a long time so it's listed
in my &quot;Kents handbook&quot; on design.

 Composition: Aluminum; 9.0-11.0 %
              Manganese; 0.10 %
              Zinc;      0.3 % max
              Silicon;   1.0 % max
              Copper;    0.5 % max
              Nickel;    0.03 % max
              Iron;       zip
              Magnesium;  remainder

  Having read a lot of these &quot;spec&quot; sheets in my previous life, I 
would expect AS21 to have 20-30% Al.
 And AS41 to have as much as 50% Al.

 I submit that our &quot;Bergness&quot; is biting wind but am the first to admit
I can't prove it yet.

 Isn't there one Mechanical Engineer out there with a &quot;Library&quot; who
can look this stuff up?

 Oh, I checked with ASTM and they claim only to &quot;list&quot; an &quot;AS41&quot;.

 Of course they won't &quot;give&quot; me the &quot;specs&quot;  but will sell me the the
&quot;spec sheet&quot;.
