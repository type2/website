Subject: RE: [T2] rear suspension

Hold on,

The rear suspension consist of a few more parts. First there is the radius
arm that allows the wheel to travel in a vertical direction. This is
controlled and guided by the spring plate. The spring plate and the radius
keep the wheel bearing housing in the vertical plane. The only way that this
could get out of the vertical plane is if you slid into a curb &quot;hard&quot;. The
spring plate is tension or holds the weight or suspends the bus via a
torsion bar. These bars can sag after a while and can be adjusted. Check you
Bentley manual for info on how to do this.

Your wheels should both be vertical, but with age, the trailing arms
sometimes twist and the wheel angles.  No adjustment for this, you need to
replace the arm, or live with the lean.  It may wear the tire some, but
other than that, there really isn't any problem.

&gt; My right rear wheel leans in at the top, but my left rear wheel seems
&gt; near vertical.  Which is correct for a bus, and where is this angle
&gt; adjusted?
