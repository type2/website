No Bondo...I wanna do it right...but, cost is an object. I  have heard it is
about a 22 hour welding job...let's see at 30 bucks an hour....well you do
the math! 
Thank You,

&gt; How do we solve the problem of really bad rust and rot around the
windshield
&gt; of a '69 bus? I heard that Rocky Mountain Motorsports carrys a window
frame
&gt; that can be welded on but, I did not see one on they're website.
&gt;
