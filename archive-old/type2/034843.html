&gt;&gt; Jack,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My name is Len, and I live in St. Helens, OR. Recently I acquired a 69
&gt;&gt; T2 in need of a lot of work -- in fact, too much for me (Lots of rust to
&gt;&gt; contend with, especially in the floors). Anyway, before I haul it away
&gt;&gt; to Averre's in Longview, I thought I'd contact you to see if any in your
&gt;&gt; club might be interested in it. It has no engine, but everything else: 2
&gt;&gt; sets of engine tin, 2 generators, two exhaust systems (1 stock and the
&gt;&gt; other a dual muffler setup), 2 sets of heat exhangers, good glass and
&gt;&gt; trim all around, good wheels and tires, including all hubcaps and a
&gt;&gt; spare, good seats (in need of cleaning or reupholstering), a good tranny
&gt;&gt; (still in the car). In fact, about all one would need is a longblock and
&gt;&gt; a carb and the bus could be on the street. Electrical is all good, so
&gt;&gt; far as I know. The best part is, since I got it for next to nothing,
&gt;&gt; I'll let it go VERY cheap. Being new to the VW world, I don't know what
&gt;&gt; it's worth, but Averre's told me they'd give me $100 for it. I know it's
&gt;&gt; worth more than that should I part it out, but I've got to move this
&gt;&gt; thing along. Does $300 sound fair to you?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If anyone is interested, they can either e-mail me at the address above,
&gt;&gt; or my phone is 503-366-1905. I hope this isn't an inconvenience for you,
&gt;&gt; but since you're in the area, I thought you'd be a good one to start
&gt;&gt; with. I hope to get into the bus scene here (with a little less
&gt;&gt; demadning prject) one of these days -- I was glad to find your site on
&gt;&gt; the web. If you don't want to deal with passing this info along, could
&gt;&gt; you direct me to other options? Thanks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Len Pine
