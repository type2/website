&gt; I have a 1979 bus which sounded great until I set it on jacks for 3 days 
&gt; while working on the fuel lines, then I took it down and fired it up now I 
&gt; have a 
&gt; lifter knock will this go away. I drove down the road and back but still 
&gt; noisy. I beleive the 79 has hydraulic lifters so what can I do. thanks

Hiya,

   I don't think being on the stands would make the lifters bleed down, but 
if your sure it's lifter knock you could pull 'em &amp; check.
They could block at any time I guess. Maybe could be that's just when it 
happened.

It just so happens I was just now checking mine. Had a pretty good knock on 
acceleration. Turns out both #3 &amp; the #4 intake were hard as a rock. Took 'em 
apart, cleaned, and...good as new. Except #3 exhaust which had an over spec. 
spring in it.
Guess that explains why half of the cam thrust bearing was wasted.

Don't forget to change your oil frequently when you have hydraulics. Which 
you have.
