snip
&gt; 
&gt; Go buy a $25 come-along and a LONG, LONG strap (to put around a tree or rock).
&gt; 
&gt; 30 minutes of labor will extract your vehicle from most any hole or puddle 
&gt; you get yourself into. Better than the cell phone we had with us the second 
&gt; time which had a signal but I had no way to explain to the wife where 
&gt; exactly we were.
&gt; 
&gt; Make that strap a long one. I was 10 feet short with the Cherokee. I did 
&gt; have a come-along on that trip but no handy trees.

&gt; Chris Mills in TN

I have found the military come-alongs at various shows.  They have a LONG
wire of good quality and strength, and an excellent 'spade' type anchor
for situations where trees are out of range.  Preferably one should back
this up with a second anchor.  In my LxxdCrxxser days we used two (or
three) &quot;t&quot; posts in series. This greatly enhances the holding power of the
primary one.  I also ask my climbing friends for their &quot;timed out&quot;
climbing ropes on the understanding that they will NEVER AGAIN be used for
climbing.  These may not be as good as fresh kevlar straps but if used
with care and sense will greatly assist in extrication.  They are
certainly a lot nicer to have around than some old twine. The object is
not to jerk the vehicle out with the come-along but to assist the vehicle
in getting traction in the desired direction.
