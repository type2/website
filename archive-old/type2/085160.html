Subject: I have lights..THANKS STEVE!!!

All,

I just wanted to post a big thanks to Steve Dolan who so graciously came out to my place last night and hung out to fix my lack of brake lights and turn signals problem. What a prince.

I'm going to spend this evening cleaning up some corroded connections (we found a lot of those) and getting her cleaned up for our first camping trip together. 

Anyway, thanks Steve!
