Subject: Re:Drop an engine, giving away a bus#2

Mike, and everyone else too,
   On the late baywindow buses the rear apron does not come out.  For an 
engine pull on the 77 that we used to have, I would remove the rear bumper 
to provide a few more inches of ground clearance.  This would allow me to 
roll the bus forward with the engine sitting on the ground.  Otherwise the 
bottom edge of the bumper would hit the engine.
