&gt; And don't listen to anything else, just Paranoid repeated!

My bus is parked on the edge of a public alley and it has been
occasionally subject to some vandalism...well being in the central core of
the city, when kids started hanging around I found the local 24/7 country
radio station and started playing that loud enough for them to &quot;decide&quot; to
go elsewhere...  (remember Rap is the music de jur in this neighborhood)


mostly the younger kids leave things alone, they know when I'm in the
garage I have small toolbox with stuff they can borrow to fix their bikes
and things, so they pretty much protect the area.
