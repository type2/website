Subject: felt flywhell seal
Message-ID: &lt;19990424.141629.4439.7.kayakjr_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

When putting the flywheel back on, I noticed that I did not have the felt
seal that goes in the center on the flywheel.  It wasn't in my gasket
kit, and a FLAPS checked their kit and theirs did not have one either. 
He didn't have a listing either.  I don't recall having one on the
flywheel when I removed it either.  Anyway, due to time I plan to skip it
as it appears to only seal the small amount of grease from the pilot
bearing, and perhaps slow any potential leak from the case in the center.

Any comments or advice? please p-mail me, i'm in digest mode and
assembling the engine as you read this
