Subject: Re: [T2] Help prevent a vanagon related suicide!

People have suggested a vacuum leak, which would result in lean running.
But, the opposite situation, i.e., too rich, can cause the exact same
symptoms.  Since you said the problem was occurring in traffic (suggesting
the engine is warm) and that sometimes you'd have to wait a minute or two
before it'd start, a too-rich mixture (a not-uncommon problem for an '81
AFM) was my first thought.  If you've got an California vehicle with an O2
sensor you might check the output of that (engine completely warmed up) or,
if it's a Federal model, take it to a shop with an exhaust gas analyzer.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I think I'm going to name my 81 Vanagon &quot;The Pain that Never Ends.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Got it back from the shop a week ago.  Engine was rebuilt and running
strong.  Automatic tranny shifting real smooth.
&gt;
&gt; I've got a problem that's getting worse.
&gt;
&gt; Originally, it would stall intermittingly at traffic lights and stop
signs, if I kept it in drive.  If I shifted into neutral, it kept running.
Most of the time, it was fine.  I figured it was water in the gas or
something that would work itself out with time.  I put in a bottle of &quot;dry
gas&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; But instead of getting better, it got worse.
&gt;
&gt; Then it started to stall at almost all stops.  Putting it in neutral
didn't always save it.  Most of the time it would start right back up, but
not always, which made for some interesting traffic patterns...if I waited a
minute or two, it would start back up.
&gt;
&gt; Today it started stalling while coasting at speeds lower than 25 mph.  I'm
scared to drive it anywhere....
&gt;
&gt; I swapped out the fuel filter, thinking it might be a clogged fuel filter.
The vehicle did sit for a year while I was working on it.  It's got a brand
new fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; I tightened up the alternator belt.  That seemed to help, for a while.
&gt;
&gt; I thought it might be a vacuum leak, but I'll be damned if I can find one.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?   I've put so much time and money and blood into this
thing...
