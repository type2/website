Subject: [T2] Re: VW Gas Fired Heaters-Was staying warm

I've run a factory BN-4 gas heater in my '69 Dormobile for the last three years
and love it.  I rehabbed it following Ron Van Ness' articles and instructions.
I live in Great Falls Montana, drive my bus every day all year around and if I
ever get around to replacing the door seals I would never get cold!
If you find one, follow the manuals and guides explicitly, and change your fuel
lines once a year you'll love the results.
I even found a place in Spokane to buy a sheet of Buna-N rubber and replaced the
diaphragms in the fuel pump and the fuel meter.
All the information can be found in the type2 library or tech articles.
good luck,
