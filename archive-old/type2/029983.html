Not quite yet. It might just be needing a disassembly and seal
replacement. Without some other info that is a premature assumption.
Sort of along the lines of &quot;My car has a little rust&quot; &quot;OK, start saving
money for a new car then and plan it for next year&quot;.

Short of pulling the engine there are head gaskets, push rod seals, oil
sump plate etc. Which can all be done on a type 4 engine without pulling
it.
There may be other problems but oil leaks alone dont indicate them.


&gt; Start saving your money for a rebuild! Then slate it for next year.

&gt; &gt;Also, my Type 4 engine is leaking oil (big surprise).  I've seen leaks from
&gt; &gt;the valve cover gaskets, and also suspect that oil is leaking from the
&gt; &gt;pushrod tubes.  In addition, oil appears to be running down the sides of 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;oil filter and dripping off the bottom.  Finally, the oil sump is covered
&gt; &gt;with oil (on the outside).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Short of pulling the engine and replacing everything I can reach, Jason
