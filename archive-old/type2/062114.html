&gt;...I'm going to run down to Cabo next July.  I'll probably spend
&gt;fifteen days on the run, border to border, mebbe more
&gt;...  One year from the day, I'm going to swim thru the Arch at
&gt;Land's End.  
&gt;...Anybody want to come?

Man, these things always happen.....Adventure galore, might as
well be on the other side of the world. 

My trusty '71 Bus would love to come, I asked her last night,
but, alas, she feels too decrepid to come that far and brave the
Baja roads.

So, I humbly submit my request for dontations, ride space, 
etc. If anybody else is going, especially from the east coast, and needs
a friendly, laid back driving companion, skilled at long 
driving stretches, please give me a call. I can pay my share
(And more, if you provide the vehicle), of any cross country
expenses. Or, mabye I can fly to Sandy Eggo and hook up with someone
there. At last resort, would a listy 'rent' me a vehicle for the time?
(Ill take good care of your baby.) I would even buy it from you, and
you could buy it back, cheaper, at the end of the trip. (Do they
check registration at the border?)

Please?? (Dont make me beg any more, but I wanna go!) Baja has 
been a dream of mine, diving the kelp beds and seeing the infamous
Baja sunsets.
