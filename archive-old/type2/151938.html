&gt; &gt; hey type2 list i am telling you guys first someone
&gt; &gt; contacted me the other day regarding they had vdo
&gt; &gt; type2 73-79 fuel tank sendinging units they wanted


three routes to putting one in all documented in the archives

.take the engine out.   wiggle it in

.lower engine just a bit, or not if Fuel injected. lay on deck work upside
down wiggle it in.

. cut hole in deck above guage,  pull and put new one in,  make cover for
hole.  (and don't cut fuel tank)

. I have used the second method and it is a PITA, but probably no more so
than the other options


having someone with very small hands and arms to get in there is a serious
plus

good luck.

Bob
