Subject: Re: [T2] buying and trasnporting questions / laws / dmv?

I just dont have the time to deal with this right now, I think im going to 
have to just insist that I keep the plates on it. if they want them back, 
ill mail them back to them when I get home, this is too much BS to deal with 
the day before I fly out to pick it up.

Ive tried calling the DMV for about 3 hours now, it just rings busy forever. 
For only 95 cents, I can have them call me when its available. yea, right.
