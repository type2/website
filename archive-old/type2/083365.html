&gt; Not so sure about that.  Tried FRS on the way to
&gt; Everybus and the darn thing didn't have much
&gt; range.  If you couldn't see the other guys
&gt; antenna it didn't work.

I've found that it works great for normal caravan operations.  The makers
claim 2 miles, but I think that 1/2 mile is more realistic.  CB doesn't do
much better unless you have a real &quot;trucker's special&quot;

&gt; And somebody's radio was
&gt; dead at all times it seems.  (Ever tried changing
&gt; those batteries while driving.)

some manufacturers scrimp on battery capacity, using AAA batteries in
order to make their units smaller.  If you get a unit that uses AA
batteries you will have longer life.  My $10 Unidens get about 15 hours
out of a set of batteries.

&gt; Besides you can
&gt; get directions and traffic info off CB if you
&gt; don't mind putting up with the crap on there.

The crap is the problem.  Truckers used to be pretty good resources, but
these days they don't do much for us.

&gt; Besides, nothing says 70's like a CB.

Yes, particularly if you can find a 23-channel unit!

&gt; Hard to beat the FRS around the camp sites, but I
&gt; didn't hear anyone using them at EB.  Would have
&gt; been nice for paging folks or making
&gt; announcements.

Usage is increasing.  It's just a matter of getting units in everyone's
hands, and at the current $10 prices this is getting pretty easy.
