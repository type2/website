Subject: '71 disc brake questions

I just rebuilt a couple of '71 calipers but there was nothing between the
pistons and the pads. Isn't there supposed to be some sort of retainer in
there. Are there any adverse effects of operating the caliper without it? I
have the notch on the piston surface pointing down as to avoid water pooling
in there. I assume this is correct.
