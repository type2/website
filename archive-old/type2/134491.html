Subject: Re: [T2] Brake fluid leakage - again

Bart said:

 I seam to have more then one leakage problem Fluel system is updated
though, now I still have a leakage of brake fluid at the connection between
the dual cilinder and the master cilinder. After a lot of trouble findint
them, I already replaced both seals but these don4t seam to fit correct. Any
tips to further stop the leak? Sealing compound that is brake fluid resistant?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

NO sealing compound is used anywhere brake fluid is.

I am assuming you have NEW seals between the reservoir and the master?
#58 here: http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t205100.gif

If yes, then you have one of two problems: either the reservoir is cracked, # 1
or # 2 [you never gave the year of your bus] ( # 1 is 69-70.... # 2 is 71-79)
OR the sealing grommet between the tube and the reservoir is leaking, # 59.

The CORRECT seals between the reservoir and master WILL fit correctly.

The seals between the reservoir and master are part # 211 611 817 A
The seals between the tube and both resrvoirs are part # 211 611 833 C
