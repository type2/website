Subject: oil cooler donut gaskets 1600 motor

O.K 
1600 motor 
so i replaced the oil cooler after determining it to
be leaking.
A friend said that i could have just replaced the
gaskets but  what the hell it's done now.
Anyway the same friend said that often those gaskets
will seat after a short time and the oil cooler will
need to be tightened down.  So i put 500 miles on it
and it's leaking alot from the same place. If anyone
has had experience with this and has advice i would
love th3e  help.  Should i use any gasket seal. Red ?
Blue? 

thanks a gain listies
