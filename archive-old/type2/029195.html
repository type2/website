If your not getting power to the panel on city power open the back of the
voltage inverter (grey box under bench seat) and check the fuse there.
There is also a fuse at the bottom of the panel you can check. If both of
those are good then plug into city power and see if the inverter hums or
gets warm. It's possible the transformer burnt out, but unlikely.

I'm not sure on the 2 wires, I thought the one with the fuse was backup
lights. I could be wrong though, take a look at this camper wiring diagram.
My bus was rewired by the PO with an isolator.

Back when my fridge worked I used to run the fridge on the battery using
the panel timer to keep the battery from going dead. If you put the panel
on city power (without the bus being plugged into 110V) and then turn on
the timer, it makes a connection to battery for the duration of the timer,
and powers the fridge. The point of this was to allow you to charge the
battery when plugged into 110V, but it works for this purpose also.
