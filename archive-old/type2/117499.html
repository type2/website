&gt; On my 77 Riveria, I noticed that the fuel neck was just slightly

&gt; could feel the hose clamp loose as a goose.
&gt; 
&gt; So how do you tighten that damn clamp when you can't see in the
&gt; hole.._dot_can only get one arm up there...and are not a contortionist!

take out the FI ECU to give you a little more room, then use Stubby
screwdrivers and mirror (and a valium).   good luck
