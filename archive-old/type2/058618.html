Leave that thing on. I've got one just like it on my 70 1600 sp. Makes abig
difference. Mine never runs over 230 either. The only scary thing is the
external lines. Keep an eye on them. One time one of mine came loose. Very
very scary. But a happy ending, no blown engine. Some driver behind me was
nice enough to give a crap and tell me before it was too late. Still very
scary.   Quartz
