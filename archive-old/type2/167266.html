Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Bus locks

Hi Luis,

Remove the rear hatch lock handle. there's a 4-digit code on the  
side. That is the code for the key.  Send that code to Steve at  
www.steveslockshop_dot_com and he can cut you a replacement key for a  
reasonable cost, and ship it fedex so it gets to you quickly.

Enjoy your new ride.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I bought a 73 Bus there misses the key. following the seller  
&gt; information
&gt; all locks uses the same key. I would like manage this and it has  
&gt; two ways to
&gt; fix, I guess. find the key code and ask for a new one to VW or to  
&gt; replace all
&gt; inner locks to new ones. These are the more cheaper solution, isn't  
&gt; it? I am
&gt; open to all ideas to solve this in a less spent money way.
