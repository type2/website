Subject: [T2] Looking for good used exhaust parts
Content-Disposition: inline

Anybody know where I can get some good exhaust replacement parts used?  I need just about everything from manafolds pipes on.  I also need 1 heaterbox to blower cover plate for a 77 Westy.

I've tried the used parts shop at Motorworks already.  I've also check just about every junk yard around central NY.

Has anyone had a bad experience with the $99 'Stock Replacement Exhaust' that eliminates crossover pipe and elbow from Cal Imports (vwc-071-251-053-ps)?  I like the price, but I don't want to replace the exhaust or my engine next year due to me being cheep.

Thanks,
Mike
