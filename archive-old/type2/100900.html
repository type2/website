Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid question about dealers.

&gt;      I'm seeing allot of posts about dealer parts.  Does this mean that 
&gt; dealers still stock some of the parts for older VWs?  I can actually walk in 

I've found it to be &quot;pot luck&quot; some of the older dealers with long time
parts managers will frequently never return or throw out old parts, and
well &quot;who knows&quot; what they have in the back corner of the store room.

&gt; to my local VW dealership and say &quot;Can you still get a rear brake drum for 
&gt; my 1974 VW bus&quot; and not sound like a loon?  I didn't know dealers/VW still 
&gt; had parts available for such old/antique vehicles.

doesn't hurt to try, might hit paydirt, a VW dealer that has been there
for a long time and isn't pressed for space and hasn't remodeled his parts
dept is probably your best bet.  but what have you got to loose by asking,
I do all the time, once in a while I even get what I'm looking for but I
sure would never count on it

&gt;  Are there prices stupid 
&gt; high like they are for new car parts or are they comparable to a bus-depot 
&gt; or busboys?

my experience is they are either stupid high or crazy low.  if VW has
marked the part NLA they use the last price in the book, even if it is 20
years old, if VW still lists the part it probably is stupid high.  again
pot luck.

Good luck
