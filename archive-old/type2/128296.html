&gt; This is a presumed good trans.  I trust this guy's work, although he
&gt; has not rebuilt a trans for me before.

Even good rebuilders occasionally produce a lemon.  I have a transmission
from a high-recommended SoCal rebuilder that dropped out of 4th on
deceleration.  When it first happened, I just figured that I had been
ripped off and put in another transmission.  However, many folks since
have convinced me that it would have been better if I had returned the
transmission to the rebuilder for correction.  Live and learn.

For you situation, there is nothing in the linkage that would make a
transmission drop out of 4th.  The transmission needs fixing.
