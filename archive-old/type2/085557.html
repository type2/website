&gt; I just received a front window sun shield from &quot;Heatshield&quot;.
&gt; It is an item I became aware of from another bus owner.
&gt; Made by a company called Canvas Works (1-800-777-6405).
&gt; Each shield is custom cut to fit the specified vehicle model - year - style.
&gt; 
&gt; WOW !
&gt; What a great product for keeping the sun off your dash, and out of your
&gt; vehicle when it is parked in the hot Texas sun.
&gt; 
&gt; Just as great ............ This thing fits so well, supports itself with
&gt; such a proper custom cut, that it will be more than the best thing I can
&gt; think of to serve as an interior style front curtain while camping.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand it is available for side and rear windows as well.
&gt; I will call today.
&gt; 
&gt; $25.00 plus shipping, and I am very satisfied !

I found the delivery time a little long but I was very happy when it finally
arrived and they probably made it to order.
