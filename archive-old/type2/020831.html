To Dr Tim et al on the list,
Hello from the 221,000 mi orginal never rebuilt 78 motor that still has
135lb compression that jumps to 160 when oil is added to cylinder.  I
run a bit rich (blackish exhaust pipe coating), but still do 70+ on the
highway and 18mpg.   As you remember, my owner  had the clutch problems
(&quot;grabbing&quot; while pedal was in and throwout bearing indeed going in. 
   MB here with 5 QUESTIONS: - this LACK OF CLUTCHING turned out to be
the lining coming off on the pressure plate side of the Canadian Sachs
relined disk- found lots of it caked to the flywheel (suspect it may
have caused the imbalance/vibration felt in the motor when revving it to
a CERTAIN rpm, or letting it go beyond that rpm and letting it drop
until that point).  (1) Is that possible?  I had replaced the
flywheel/engine seal back at the clutch change 70K ago, but not the
trans seal, which appears to be the source of the oil film observed over
the bell housing and mixed with the lining material. Thought the
vibration  might be also be worn mains, but oil pressure has never gone
to flicker.  Now while engine is out, I want to replace rear seal and
pulled the fan and the crank fan mount (now that was fun- a 3 armed
puller pulled to max didn't budge it, so I applied gentle heat with
acetylene and it popped off like a champagne cork!  Slight rust film
seen on mating surfaces.  (2) Is antizieze compound allowed on a tapered
surface for reinstall??
     Flywheel came off OK, pilot bearing no prob., came off with my
finger!  Put a bolt into the center hole of the crank on fan side, a
vise grip on it, and rocked up and down, no play, although endplay is
obvious with flywheel off.  My last endplay check involved a variation
of Muir's method that may interest the group- to a bolt secured to the
trans mount hole is nutted on a giant washer to which is welded 2 nuts
holding a valve tappet adjustor bolt.  Pull flywheel back.  Turn
adjustor so it just touches flywheel.  Push flywheel in.  Use feeler
gauge to check play. (3) Can't do this until fan mount is back on, no? 
(4) Any other checks of determining wear that can be done without
further teardown??  
   BTW, while vacuuming the engine crevaces, I found this red heavy
gauge wire with no connector, just bare coppper- and then DOH, realized
I never pulled that connector wich is still fastened to the starter!
Got the LUK clutch replacement kit from Ron's- it includes a pilot
bearing and Brazilian throwout bearing.  Very heavy looking pressure
plate and disk.   (5) Being extra thick, will any of this affect the
throwout bearing clearance, or is there enough room in fully backed
bearing fork to allow this??  Danke
