&gt;Rumor is that an unnamed listee whose initials are Dave Schwarze has 
been running hydraulic lifters on a solid cam for over 2 years. I won't 
name my source for this info, but Ken Hooper swears he hasn't seen 
convincing evidence that there's a problem with doing this, other than 
possibly some small performance hit.
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for informed opinions that are backed up with sound theory 
or actual evidence for or against  

I have 48,000 miles on my 77 Westy using a solid cam, hydraulic lifters, 
hydraulic pushrods, solid springs, and hydraulic spacers between the 
rocker arms. My bus cruises all day at 85 mph. I have not had any 
problems with this combination. The cam was the one in my engine when I 
bought the bus with 192,000 miles on it. The engine was a VW of Canada 
rebuilt that I can't document when it was installed. It was using one 
quart of oil every 100 miles. I split the case, replaced all bearings, 
replaced the P + C with a NPR set, and disassembled the heads and 
inspected. Found nothing wrong with the heads so I reused them. Replaced 
the solid lifters with 8 handpicked used ones from the wrecking yard. 
Once I missed changing the oil at 3000 miles and changed it at 6000. I 
was a little annoyed that it used 1/2 a quart of oil in 6000 miles. It 
doesn't leak any oil. I also use the Vanagon electronic ignition set-up. 
This engine/bus hasn't failed to start/run in 4 years/48000 miles.
Would I use hydraulic lifters on a solid cam again? 
You bet...I have put them in my daughters 77 Westy, same cam/spring 
combo as mine. I did hers a little over 3 years ago. 
I would make sure to get the spacers and wave washers from the rocker 
arm assemblies of a hydraulic lifter engine. 
I don't think I would use the heavier valve spings. I didn't because I 
didn't want premature wear on the cam/lifters from the increased spring 
pressure. Whether this is true or not, I don't know. I do know I have 
had no problems using solid springs.
