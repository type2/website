Subject: sunroof cables and the porn spam nuke fest.

Hi,

I accidentally nuked a personal message regarding my sunroof cable
message of yesterday. The direct email was sent to me in the last 
twelve hours or so, but got the /dev/null, vaporization treatment while 
purging the over night influx of offers to make things bigger, easier 
and/or cheaper. If the person who sent the message would not mind 
resending it, I would be most grateful.

My apologies to everyone else on the list.

jack
