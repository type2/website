&gt;As a rule I seldom find penetrating oil needed although it can't
&gt;hurt...

Am I the only one who thinks spraying these things with Liquid Wrench and
suchlike is sort of, well, dumb? The threads on those bolts are a good two
inches from the heads, and the heads are all you can spray. The stuff is
not gonna travel that far.

WD-40 might do for cleaning them out (and I agree that cleaning them is
very important) but I don't see how it could possibly do any good as a
penetrant. If you don't want to strip those bolts, turn them with
vise-grips on the outside while you turn them with the appropriate tool on
the inside. That *always* works.
