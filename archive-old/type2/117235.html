Subject: [T2] PopTop Refinished...body paint question

&gt;If it's pretty warm out the paint will also start setting up before you
can &quot;tip&quot; the rolled finish with a brush---and as with his large area of
the flybrige---as well as the sides of your Westy--this can be a problem
in having dry area's---where the brush will drag on the semi starting to
harden paint--very difficut to spread out over a large slab sided panel.&gt;

Proper thinning and not painting in overly hot or humid weather is the key
here...Multiple thinner coats are always better than one thick one no
matter how you apply it.

&gt;I have sprayed all of the bullet proof urethanes--Imron, Petit, and
Awlgrip to boat hulls and top sides----with great long term results---
But this rolling and brushing thing takes a bunch more time than I care
to get involved with--it can be done---but what a pain--

I am in complete agreement here. Having worked in boatyards for the better
part of my life and currently owning 3 sailboats (14ft Jet 14, 28ft
Columbia, 17ft Thistle) I have done a lot of rolling and tipping. I was
taught by an old salt who was a master at varnish and brightwork. There is
an art to doing this properly and it is very tough. My father used to paint
the topsides of the 35ft wooden yawl that we sailed for years this way and
you could not tell it was not sprayed. But he had many years of practice.
Like Terry said &quot; what a pain&quot;

As for the bus spraying is the way to go. It is not as hard as you may
think. Just take your time and pick your weather. The thing about painting
a bus is that you have a lot of big flat surfaces. The toughest part in
paintingit is the corners. Actually the toughes part is the prep work .
Without starting a another paint thread I would just say this. Any paint
job no matter what paint you use is only as good as the prep work you put
under it.
