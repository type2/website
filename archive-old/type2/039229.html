Subject: Re: O2 Sensor on '78 Westy

John and all the rest who have responded to my O2 question.
Richard's bus is a '78 Westy, with a new FI engine.  As I understand it, temp sensors are up on the heads, not out in the exhaust system.  This bus has what appears to be a Cat in the exhaust stream as well, so am thinking that the motor may be a '79... ??... however, last evening, while we were looking over his motor, Mike G. pointed out that this &quot;item&quot; that is inserted into the exhaust, before the muffler, was not connected to anything.  Comparing pictures of an O2 sensor in RMMW's catalog and the &quot;item&quot; on Richards exhaust, the two appear to be the same.  The picture of a temp sensor is way different than the &quot;item&quot; on Richard's exhaust system.
As well all know, PO's do different things to our beloved busses before we become owners.  Richard is trying to gain a bit more milage from his bus, as he is on a long journey around the Western, Mid Western USA, and even 3 additional MPG over a 3-4 thousand mile trip can be some significant $$ ...at the current price of gasoline here in the States.... even greater if he were touring overseas.
The question then remains, how and where does an O2 sensor get hooked up in a FI engine?  Is there a certian pin/connector on some part of the FI system...ECU, Air Flow meter...???   I am a Carb person, and the only vehicle I own with FI is a '88 Ford Aerostar... and any work on that gets done in a shop... if ya have ever looked under the hood, ya would know why..and why I drive a bus as my daily driver.

any and all help appreciated.  The Archives are currentyl down, so access to past info isn't possible.

Thanks
