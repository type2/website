Subject: Hella auxiliary batt. relay

Hello all,

I just recieved a relay kit for charging my auxiliary battery in my '78 Westy.
The PO had removed some of the connections so I decided to replace the whole
thing. Electrical is really not my strong point and looking at the diagram
that came with the kit I have some questions.  I am wanting this to just
charge the aux. battery while the engine is running as it did stock. Currently
on the the original relay, pin 87 is connected directly to the aux. battery +
and pin 85 goes to ground on the body. Pins 86 and 30 are no longer
connected.

On the diagram for the new relay pin 30 goes to vehicle battery +. 85 goes to
ground. That I understand. Now it says that 87 should go to 12/7S socket, or,
as an alternative wiring, to the aux. battery + via a single pole plug (I am
assuming this is for charging the aux. batt. directly like I want to do).
Since 87 on the old relay wires directly to the aux. + without this single
pole plug can I do the same with the new relay? What is the 12/7S socket that
it refers to? The 12v socket in the dash? This would do no good since that
socket in the Westy runs off the main battery correct?

Now for pin 86 it should go to a fused relay. This should be a switched
circuit that is only hot when the key is in the on position right? Where
should this wire go? The diagram says between the alternator and warning
light. Can I go right to the back of the alternator and if so which terminal
am I going to be looking for.

Thanks for any suggestions in very simple laymans terms :)
