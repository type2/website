Subject: 3 Bay Westie questions

Hola list members

While putting the new 77 Westie automatic back to original condition,
(Change the stats. another CA Westie comes to Canada &lt;GRIN&gt;) I've
uncovered some things I've not seen before.

- There are factory snaps along the inside lower edge of the sliding
door front sill...any idea what attaches to them???

- I noticed on the Wet Westies South Africa Caravelle page, a mention of
trip odometer, and pulsing wipers.....does a Vanagon speedo fit a 77-79
Bay...

- am I losing my mind, or do I recall pulling a small clip in the type
II wiper mechanism(on the column) and adding a pulse Rabbit relay to the
panel &amp; having pulse wipers...was in a previous life I'm sure, but
thought I'd ask

TIA for the input...

Den.
