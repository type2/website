&lt;&lt; that since a later 70s bus has a good rear tranny hanger, why can't the 
engine just hang right off the transmission? I mean - a beetle has no rear 
engine mount. &gt;&gt;

Carefully compare the the rear transaxle mount on a type 1 with that of a 
late T2 bus.  Type 1 rear transaxle mounts are designed to support the full 
weight of the engine and much of the trans.  The late T2 bus trans mount is a 
relatively small bracket that appears to stabilize the transaxle/engine combo 
and dampen vibration.  The weight is_clearly_supported by the rear engine 
support bar.  

I have let the rear trans mount on my 79 bus support the engine very briefly 
during engine installation and I wasn't even comfortable with that until I 
shifted the engine's weight back onto a small floor jack.
