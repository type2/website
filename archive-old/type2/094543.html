Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leaks??

check oil pressure sender and see if it is leaking bad.
yes you can use leak detector in an air cooled but clean up as good as 
you can before trying to use it.  oil from a bad leak can get  blown 
around into electrics and cause intermittant problems.  20  minutes 
wasnt really long enough to get oil up to its smoking point depending 
on where it was.  also the air cooled vehicle air  circulation  can put 
oil in places  that make it look like  its  leaking from where it isnt. 
  that is where the dye sometimes comes in handy.
