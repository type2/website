Subject: Re: [T2] fresh air vent pollen trapper

well yah that's a great suggestion. earlier in the day i went to home depot
and looked at the forced air/filter stuff. almost pulled the trigger on one
item, but i panned thinking i'd contact 3M and see what they have that'd
stand up to moisture. a friend of mine told me driving rain can get into
the open flaps in the nose; that in fact there are weep holes down behind
the kick panels for such moisture. this is all a big question mark to me
since i thought that moisture behind kick panels came from rusted out lower
windshields. and his holes in the chassis might be aftermarket.
digressing...

so i'm holding off on stuffing the area behind the flaps just yet because
the potential for breathing something wet and moldy in the winter is there.
little more web searching here. oh welp, something to do while my type4
heads are at rimco. anyways, i'll report if i find anything if there's
interest.   - steve

&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;Might be better to pull the front grill off and trim/install a cut up
&gt;version of a house heat/air filter.
&gt;
&gt;With a little ingenuity, you could get this to go behind your grill and in
&gt;front of the fresh air flaps.
&gt;
&gt;Probably would not hold up to rain well, but if you figured out how to
&gt;pull the flaps off and put it behind the fresh air flaps, it might work
&gt;well.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave

&gt;&gt; does anyone manufacture a fabric that is resistant to, or repells rain,
&gt;&gt; that i can install in my fresh air vents on the nose of my vw bus? a fabric
&gt;&gt; that i can cut to fit that will trap grass pollen?  - steve
