I have a 1700CC type II engine in my 1973 Bus.  Yesterday after work I found a huge puddle of gas underneath the bus.  I manage to get to a friends house only to find a nice stream of gas coming out of the fuel pump, even with the engine shut off.  There was a short piece of hose connected to it that goes no where that was source of the stream.  Can someone explain what this is for?  I do have a replacement fuel pump I plan on putting on this weekend but for now I just stuck a screw in the end of the hose so the stream of gas would stop.  The new fuel pump has the same short piece of hose sticking on it.  Thanks
