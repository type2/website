Subject: Good Starter Advice.....Bosch vs.....FLAPS cheapies

I wanted to thank Doktor Tim for some great advice.....Just wish I didnt 
have to read to the bottom of the rant to get it.

&quot;I sure would confim what comes out of the box from them or any supplier to 
insure I got what I bargained for.&quot;

I help a guy install a bosch alternator in his 78 westy in the middle of a 
walmart parking lot in the middle of an iowa winter.  Turns out the 
alternator had a bad voltage regulator and shut down the entire electrical 
system in the bus when it was plugged in.  He ended up at a local FLAPS and 
was able to get what he needed.....save about 50%.

Moral of story:  I dont care who you get it from check it out before you 
install it.....unless you need the practice of removing and installing a new 
one.   And if you get the lifetime warrenty part and have to replace it 
yourself in the future......when someone else needs help or 
advice......volunteer assistance and cheer up their day.

Some one must have had a good experience with the lower cost starter to 
recommended it.

Just a couple thoughts......
