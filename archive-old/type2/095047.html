Subject: More questions about post- engine install prob in UT

I thought after I put my engine back in that it wasn't getting fuel. It 
would turn over but not fire. This morning, I poured gas directly down the 
carb throat, and it still didn't start. I'm thinking maybe it's electrical 
now (I got some wires criss crossed on the coil maybe??). Could somebody 
direct me to an online diagram of what wires should be coming off the coil, 
or could you just tell me as there are only a few of them?  If anybody else 
has any other ideas, please share them with me. Thanks again.

ps-If there's anybody in or around Salt Lake City that would like to come 
take a look, I'd be grateful!! Will supply dinner and beer for your time...
