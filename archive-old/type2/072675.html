        Sorry for posting again, but I forgot that I also need an ash tray
for my '69 camper bus &amp; I need a new seal for my vent wing window.  The
window is drivers side rear window.  They stopped making that seal for some
reason &amp; I need one.  I have a feeling that's going to be a hard one to
get, but I thought I'd try.

Sorry for the 2 postings &amp; Thanks,
Keri
