Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

I have a Coleman Powercat also--it works OK--but it doesn't throw as
much heat as the Buddy Heater---
Blow or no Blow--the Buddy heater has it beat for BTU's, plus it has two
settings--low and high

You can put it anywhere---as long as it isn't close to something that
won't burn---
I stick mine on the floor up by the isle pointed towards the back of the
Bus / Van.

Later,

Terry

The Mr. Heater unit has very high ratings on Amazon but it being a
radiant heater I wasn't sure that it would be OK in the close quarters
of a bus--that the radiant element might melt something or blister the
veneer off the Westie table. Is that a concern? Where in your bus do you
put it?
A lower output alternative is the Coleman Powercat, a reasonably priced
forced air propane heater. You need D batteries to run the fan--

Let me report I am VERY happy with this heater,.
