&gt; Anyone know if new german made calipers are available from anyone for
an early 1972.  What is the difference between 71-72 calipers and 73-79
calipers.


the late calipers were wider to accommodate thicker brake pads.  To use
the later calipers you have to change all parts from the spindles outward.
