	Shawn,
	Scott's explanation of the two terminals on the dual sender
makes more sense than mine. A test lamp should light up when connected
between the battery and the terminal of the stock oil pressure sender 
(engine not running, no pressure) and when connected to the indicator
lamp terminal of the muliterminal sender (same conditions)
 Connections like so:
                                     |
,--[ - Battery + ]------(-_at_-)-----=[]/// Engine...
|                       lamp  sender |___
V                                      |
(chassis ground)                       V (chassis ground)

	Or you can test the sender in your hand (wipe off the oil..) 
using a second wire to connect the screw threads of the sender to
the battery - terminal.

                                     
,--[ - Battery + ]------(-_at_-)-----=[]///------,
|                       lamp  sender          | Extra wire

	The guage connection should read some number of ohms at no pressure
and a different number at pressure- varying between them with a 
characteristic ohms per lb/kilopascal/etc that the guage has to be built 
to match.

	I'm not sure how much pressure loss you'd experience in the
full flow system at temperature, but cold I wouldn't expect much
if any pressure loss. The question is give in the hoses- if they
ballon, that will raise the volume at the outlet and lower the
pressure. But cold hoses, cold oil, should be very stiff. 
	BUT its possible your hose is ballooning, or something in the
system is blocking INLET flow, thus no pressure. You don't have
pressure, or rather, you think you have 8lb, which might not be 
enough to open the warning light switch. I just checked the one
manual I have here at work today, a 914 manual, and the Type IV in
a 914 has a 2-6lb/square-inch pressure required to turn-off the 
pressure light.

	GOOD to know the GEN light is working. VERY good. Now you
realy know something isn't healthy in the oil pressure sensing
or the pressure itself.

	Take your time. You've spent too much time and money on this engine
to break something too :) Thats why you were cranking it dry and
hoping to see the oil pressure come up. That's the right impulse.

	Bill
