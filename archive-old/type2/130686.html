&gt;1) Complete OEM Sachs kit (disc, pressure plate, throwout bearing)

Got a new pilot bearing?

&gt;2) Flywheel Lock

Has anyone found a decent flywheel lock? The type I lock doesn't fit the type 4 engine:

The tines that engage the flywheel teeth aren't even well shaped. Do I need to drill a metal bar to use as a lock between the flywheel bolt holes and the lower studs to improve on this crummy design?

&gt;So I figured if the stuff was not here my like 7:00pm today it was gonna be
&gt;&quot;FLAME TIME&quot; Well it got here _at_ 2:22 P.M, so feeling gulty..I figured I'd
&gt;just drop a note saying,

I once ordered a motorcycle helmet and wasn't sure if it was going to make it by Friday evening for a riding course I was taking on Friday. I called the company and asked them to expedite the shipping to 2 day because it hadn't shipped yet. It was Monday morning when I made the call. They didn't ship it until Wed and it arrived Fri on the same day the original order would have been received.
