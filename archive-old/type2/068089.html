Subject: Re: Battery Pan rust

&gt; 73 Safari Camper Bus.  The front end of my battery pan is corroded right through. I think it is the result of a leaking battery sometime in the past.
&gt; I was quoted $150 Cdn to cut it out an replace it.  The guy recommended just using mastic and sticking a plate in under the battery to close the hole.  (The hole is about 2 inches in diameter.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?

I have pretty much the same problem - if I were you, I'd wire brush/wool
the shit out of the entire pan, then kill the rust with something. 

Next, spot weld a piece over the hole - get a garage to do this for you
if you don't have the kit - shouldn't cost much.

Then re-kill the rust!  Next prime it, paint it, then finally Waxoyl it.

Make sure that the battery is firmly fixed in place...the contents
_will_ eat your bus!

Good luck,

Jonathan.
