Hi Volks,

The Denmiester came by a few nights back to help me remove a cylinder head 
with a dropped valve seat.  So far the repair is going very well.

But that's not what I want to talk about.  While trading stories, Den 
mentioned that a conversion company (maybe Riviera?) had converted about 
1000 busses to run on electric power.  He also suggested that one of those 
busses may still be on the road in the USA, and may be owned by a list 
member!

So I'm very interested.  I'm researching a book on alternative fuels to 
power the automobile industry, and I'd love to discover that there is an 
electric bus out there... anyone know the bus or the owner?
