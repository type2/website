Subject: Two cylinders to Vermont

Volks- Ok, here goes my dilema. My friend came in to see me from
Tennessee. I'm in New Jersey, and he took about a week to get here (on
purpose). He comes in telling me that his freshly rebuilt 2 liter with no
more than 3000 miles on it has been having problems.  Lack of power is
his biggest complaint. On the way up he replaced his coil, wires and
plugs, and that seemed to help. He had a new 009 distributor with him to
replace the old one, but we fixed the timing on the old one and that also
seemed to help a bit. He thought that his valves had been adjusted wrong,
but he had hydraulics. (?) I re-adjusted them according to Bently and his
bus seemed to lose some power (?). Then we did a compression test. That
told us a lot. Cylinder #1- 90 lbs, but once the engine stopped turning
over, it all leaked out in about three seconds. #2- 120 lbs. #3-120 lbs.
#4- 90 lbs, and it all leaked out in about three seconds. On cylinders 1
and 4 I loosened up the valves by one half turn each, and did the
compression test again. Same results. I put some oil into the cylinders
and did the compression test again. 120lbs.  But on cylinder #1, every
time the engine turned over, I thought I saw some mist fly into the air.
Turned out that the spark plug threads were stripped and air was leaking
out there. #4's threads were fine.  I thought that maybe he had not
broken the piston rings in correctly, but he insists that he was &quot;easy&quot;
on the bus for the first 2000 miles. I know that giving the engine a
break-in routine is important- could this have caused his problem? Here's
another twist in the equasion- His first 1700 miles were with a carb that
would only run EXTREMELY rich. Could this overly rich mixture have added
to or caused the problem? 
	This is what we did- I hated doing it, but it was his bus and he
needed to get to Vermont.  We JB Welded the #1 spark plug into the hole
and prayed that it sealed well. He left after letting it dry for 24 hours
and yes, he did arrive in Vermont. 
	His engine does NOT run hot, even after a one hour drive in 90
degree heat (I could hold the bottom end of the dipstick and not get
burned). I have a great workshop in my basement, and I really wanted to
pull his engine and see what was going on in there, but he had to be
moving on. He knows very little about engines, and before he drops his
baby off at some strange mechanic's shop, he would like to have some idea
of what is going on. Any Ideas?
Thanks in advance,
