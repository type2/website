Stud pullers that have a collet work much better than those roller-style. I
have a set of roller-style Hazet stud pullers and they are almost useless
and they cost me a small fortune. The roller style pullers damage the
threads. The only thing they are good for is removing exhaust studs that are
going to be replaced anyway. Even then, it is very hard to find a puller
that will fit into the small space around the stud.

I also have a set of collet style and they work like a charm, no thread
damage at all and they will pull the most difficult studs. Mine are not
snap-on, but they look similar to these:
