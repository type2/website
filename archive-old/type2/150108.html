Subject: RE: [T2] New engine in the bus!

Thanks for the tip on the wiring, Richard.  Didn't know what to look for
on the diagram before, but now I think I'm looking at 8, 17, and either
21 or 22.  I'll have to check those for continuity between the ends and
the test plug.

As for your other questions:
1. I didn't bother with a compression test since the engine was straight
out of the crate.  Probably wouldn't hurt, though.

2. I don't have the engine # with me right now, but Erin (sp?) at AVP
agreed there should have been a hole tapped and she was puzzled as to
why there was not.  I'm just glad they're going to reimburse me the
expense.

3. I don't know the part # on the head - would have to take a look.  By
the way, where is the part #?

Thanks again!
Jeremy

The wiring diagram shows them going to the battery and other test
points. Look at all the number orange circles:
