Subject: '77 Westy..parts bus.. who needs parts?, In Big Sur, CA
Message-ID: &lt;377D88D5.AF12C86C_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hey all,
I am getting a '77 westy tomorrow that can either be a parts bus or a
renovation.  Problem for me with the renovation is that I do not have
the space in my narrow mountain driveway to store and work on it.  It is
in decent shape all and all, it has two engines, one of which has FI
problems the other has cracked heads and number of other nasty
problems.  The second engine has all the FI parts in tact.  It has new
Air Flow Meter which I think I can use as I noticed on mine the dreaded
groove beginning to show up.  

I believe it is a full deluxe camper.  I really would like to restore
the damn thing, I hate to lose another bus from giving happiness to
someone (and of course moments of utter despair and loathing).  

I have this dilemma, the thought goes like this, should I restore the
bus and sell it to someone who will keep it running, or should I take
the best parts from it, use the nice fabric from the upper bunk to
recover my front seats, etc., in essence should I sacrifice one bus for
the better of my bus and it's lasting future.  

If I part it out whom out there needs what parts and come to pick them
up In Big Sur/Carmel/Monterey Bay area?  I am too busy to try and ship
anything.

Or is there someone near here that has a place to store it for a short
period of time for me to arrange for a place for me too work on it?

Thanks,
Scott
