&gt;Aside from anecdotal evidence, are there any official reports or stats
&gt;on safety issues with 68-79 Transporters? Although we only use the
&gt;camper a few months every year for our annual road holidays and I am a
&gt;very slow (even by type 2 standards) and defensive driver, I have 
always
&gt;been worried about safety of my occupants in case of crash throughout
&gt;almost 20 years of driving a VW bus. I will install new seatbelts (not
&gt;from a junkyard!) this spring and make sure all passengers (4 kids, 
wife
&gt;and me) are always buckled up. Still, am I right to be worried? I
&gt;checked all the articles and reviews in the Brooklands Road Test book
&gt;but did not find much about safety except a statement about the new 72
&gt;Kombi that said that &quot;it sets new standards in performance and safety&quot;.
&gt;Hmmmm...that's reassuring...

Yeah, I guess if they're saying the safety is as good as the 
performance, that's kinda scary :-)

I think that in general, the Type 2 tends to be fairly safe.  It is a 
large vehicle and the passengers sit well above the level of where most 
collisions would take place.  It's also a fairly heavy vehicle, which 
gives it an edge in crashes with lighter vehicles.  Additionally, it 
seems to be pretty solidly built and from what I've seen they can 
withstand rollovers pretty well too.  

Since the VW Bus doesn't have a lot of modern safety features like front 
and side airbags, ABS, seatbelt pretensioners, etc. etc., your safety is 
much more in your hands than in the car's hands.  Riding up at the front 
of a Bus will certainly teach you not to tailgate once you realize how 
thin that one piece of sheetmetal is that's beetween you and that car in 
front of you.

You have to do what you can to avoid an accident since there are not a 
lot of safety features to help you once you've gotten into an accident.

The first part of this is to wear seatbelts.  This includes everyone in 
the vehicle, including those in the back seat.  They keep occupants from 
being ejected from the vehicle or striking objects or other people 
inside the vehicle in the event of a collision.  

You also need to make certain that your car is in safe mechanical 
condition, as this will help in preventing accidents.  Do all your 
lights work?  Does the horn work?  Do you use your turn signals?  How 
far gone are the tires?  Are you keeping your rear brakes adjusted?  
Does your parking/emergency brake work?  When's the last time you 
replaced your brake fluid?  Are your fuel lines in good shape and 
clamped?  Does the engine run properly (not stalling out at inopportune 
times)?  What is the condition of your front suspension parts and 
steering gear?  When's the last time you checked the condition of the 
suspension components?  Is the window glass free of defects?  Are your 
sunvisors still there?  Is your front axle beam rusty?

Another important but often overlooked factor is loose items inside the 
vehicle.  Certainly we all carry tool boxes around and those of us with 
Westfalias probably carry a lot of crap around.  This can be very 
dangerous.  In a collision, any of those items become missiles and can 
seriously injure or kill you.  This includes any unbelted occupants of 
the vehicle.  To decide whether an item can safely remain loose in the 
vehicle, do the &quot;Ow&quot; test.  Take the item in question and smack yourself 
upside the head with it, hard.  If it hurts, you better secure that item 
somewhere so it won't be flying around inside the vehicle in a 
collision.  I know I wouldn't want to be clocked upside the head with a 
toolbox or a fire extinguisher.  

Another concern is proper securing of infants and small children in 
child safety seats.  If you are not securing your small child in such a 
seat, well, quite frankly you should be taken out into the street and 
beaten quite severely.  If you can't be bothered to care enough about 
your own child to secure him or her in a safety seat, then there's not 
much hope for you.  

The point I'm trying to make is that the VW Bus, or any car for that 
matter, is as safe as you make it.  You have the responsibility to 
ensure that your vehicle is in safe operating condition and you then 
have the further responsibility to operate it safely.  If you are truly 
concerned about safety then you will no doubt inspect all the above 
aspects of your vehicle as soon as possible and correct what needs 
attention.

I've tried to apply the no loose items doctrine in my vehicles.  I would 
have failed horribly in the '81 Vanagon I used to have as I don't know 
how well those Westy cabinet doors would remain closed in a crash but I 
have a feeling they'd pop right open and all manner of tools and heavy 
unpleasant objects would have been raining down on me.

In the Mercedes-Benz I have, it's easier as I can (and do) stow all 
those items in the trunk.  I've even taken to stowing the ice scraper 
and snow brush in the trunk rather than leaving them on the floor like I 
used to do.  About the only thing I have in the Benz to hit me is a 
soft-bound map book, which is stored in a seatback pocket fairly 
securely.  If it hit me I don't think it would hurt too much :-)

The Karmann Ghia, however, is another story.  Not only do I have a loose 
fire extinguisher inside on the floor behind the passenger seat, but the 
'74 Ghia, instead of a rear seat, has a storage locker not unlike the 
rear seat of a Westy, except that there is no locking mechanism for the 
lid.  Of course in this locker are lots of heavy and potentially painful 
items.  I've got to rig up some sort of system to keep this thing closed 
and also secure the fire extinguisher.

Well this went on a lot longer than I thought it would but hopefully it 
will make you think about the various factors that have an effect on 
your safety.
