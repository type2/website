Scott, some of the best money you can spend!!  I have messed with points for
years, always checking the dwell, then resetting, what a hassle.  So I moved
up to the digital world, no more points going closed from bad rubbing
blocks, no more burned points, no more engines running bad when the points
wear and the dwell changes thus changing the timing as well.  I haven't had
to even think about points for thousands of carefee miles!!  And with a
hydraulic lifter engine, man, I've got more time to spend elsewhere on my
bus.

To install takes maybe 20 minutes, then your done!  That's it, nothing else
to do.  Be sure to order the electronic ignition that fits your distributor
and it is easier to work on if you pull your distributor out and work it on
a bench.

&gt; Hi, anybody have any experience with a compu-fire pointless ignition system?
&gt; Was wondering what is involved to convert from standard points to something
&gt; solid state. &quot;pointless&quot; no pun intended! LOL
