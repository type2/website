Hey!

I'm really enjoying reading the &quot;Where you live&quot; stuff. It seems that 
there aren't as many women as men and that there's NOBODY over here on 
the Eastern Sierra with us.

VanBondo reassures Kath that although there may not &lt;appear to&gt; be as many
women on this list as men they each count for more! We like the ladies on
the lists. Of the fe-persons listies that I know of it seems that they tend
to have great spirits and in general are not afraid to throw a wrench. One
buddy of mine &quot;Linda B.&quot; from the Vintagvw list is in her third trimester
with twins with two others milling around and was &lt;seriously&gt; still haunting
junkyards as recent as three weeks ago. She does her own work and the &quot;ol'
man&quot; isn't into VWs to speak of. Add Clara, &quot;Showerhead Martha&quot; of the CCC's
and 181 list fame plus all the others that I am not mentioning. 
Overall, I for one, encourage full participation by the ladies!
GO GIRLS!
As for the boomer thing- well I think that we &lt;some of us&gt; just don't
respond as quickly as we used to! ;-)
