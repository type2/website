Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel warning

Hi Janice,

Personally, I wonder what these additives are doing to combustion 
chamber temperatures. Up here in the Great White North, one of the 
larger fuel chains is selling &quot;Cleaner burning&quot; fuel with an additive 
called &quot;Tactrol&quot;. They advertise their higher octane blends as having 
more of that stuff than the lower octane grades. When I'm forced to buy 
fuel there I always buy the lower octane.

With the number of burned valves that my bus-friends and I have seen in 
the recent past, I wouldn't be surprised to find that modern fuels are 
far from &quot;air-cooled friendly&quot;. But getting a fuel vendor to admit to 
that won't be easy. Imagine the number of valve seats they'd be held 
liable for!

Happy trails,
