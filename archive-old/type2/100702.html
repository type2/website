This is the early November notice to the listserve subscribers for the Voluntary Accelerated Vehicle Retirement (VAVR) Automatic Old Car
Notice.

For further information, please see:
http://www.arb_dot_ca_dot_gov/msprog/avrp/emailnotification.htm

Here are the cars scheduled for delivery, Saturday, November 2, 2002:

Vehicle: 69 VOLKS                     Partial VIN: 23902259

If you are sincerely interested in making an appointment to go to the
dismantler to inspect and potentially buy any of these vehicles, please email me at cbennett_at_arb_dot_ca_dot_gov by 4:00 p.m., Monday, November 4, 2002.

Due to the extremely large number of subscribers to this service (over 1500 now), the dismantlers prefer that interested parties be limited to only those that actually plan to show at appointments to inspect the vehicles. Please note that most of the cars are only in fair condition, pass smog check, are registered and pass the vehicle eligibility inspection criteria according to local district rules.

As far as supplying information on the specifics, the program is
primarily for air quality credit generation through the early retirement of high-polluting older vehicles. However, the collector vehicle notice service resulted from the activities of restoration hobbyist in California who participate in preserving California historical vehicles and who have helped facilitate the structure of the program so that everyone gets a chance to inspect the vehicles prior to entry into the retirement program.

In that respect, the enterprise operators do not maintain complete VIN or model in their database. They actually do not get this information until the vehicle(s) arrive at their site at which time both you and the dismantler gain the opportunity to find out everything about the vehicle.

To repeat a note sent in previous reports, in response to several
requests for specific vehicle types in the South Coast Area, as yet, the VAVR automatic notification service does not filter vehicle types, but you should be able to quickly scan the list to determine if what you are looking for is among the list of vehicles. Also, partial VIN numbers are only available for expediency and privacy reasons, and the particular model is not available until you express sincere interest in the vehicle.

Please contact me at cbennett_at_arb_dot_ca_dot_gov if you have any further
questions or comments.

Thank you,

Chuck Bennett
