Subject: Still Running too hot Saga Continues

It's back...bus is still running very hot, but at least I'm eliminating 
potential problems. Thanks for all the advice. I took the bus to a good shop 
in Crested Butte (Alpine Express) believe it or not. The manager Casey, 
turns out to be an old air cooled guy.

He checked for vacuum leaks...none, pulled the engine and checked the oil 
cooler...clear. Initially he thought it was blocked. I have to say he worked 
on the bus til 10:00pm then since he could not solve the problem only 
charged me for 1 hour labor. It's good to find a good shop that won't rip 
you off.

Anyway the only thing I haven't done is replace the oil pressure relief 
spring. Any idea where I can get one. Casey suggested when I get time to 
have the engine disassembled and look for some fundamental problem. Any 
others ideas?

Now I'm in Dillon / Silverthorne any good air cooled shops in this area?
