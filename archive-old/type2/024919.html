&lt;&lt; not a week goes by when I don't have someone offer me 9000.00+ for it. 
What a change from 10 years ago, eh? ( keep in mind that these are East Coast 
busses...Don't see too many of 'em in perfect shape on this side of the 
Mississippi!) &gt;&gt;

So True!!

I have recently moved to Portland, OR and am amazed at the availability of 
westphalia and riviera bay era camper conversion  buses.  Because they are so 
common here, you can find them in excellant condition for $3000 - $4000.  No 
need to spend more than this if you have the time to shop a bit.

Sounds like some vacation opportunities here!!  Buy a great Washington/Oregon 
bus for $4000, enjoy a cross country road trip to the north east, sell it in 
the &quot;rust zone&quot; for $7000 and buy a plane ticket home.  Break even on the 
experience and its a great way to see the country.
