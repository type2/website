Subject: Re: [T2] New VW Bay Window DST Rules

Hi All, 

Bus content:  I'm positive that both my Dakota Digital CHT *and* my
stereo system will survive the change in daylight savings.  Though the
stereo may require the clock to be reset. Or it would require the clock
to be reset, if I ever get off my lazy butt and move the &quot;constant hot&quot;
wire to a real &quot;constant hot&quot; instead of the &quot;switched hot&quot;.  It'd
probably save the radio stations then, too. ;) 

Well, the &quot;decision&quot; to bump up daylight savings is causing me no end of
grief.  

All of our servers pull their time from an outside source.  So that's no
problem.  

The cron jobs... well, the only things running in that time window are
system tasks.

but backups.... cripes.  

Suddenly I'll have files that have a time/date stamp an hour from what
they &quot;should&quot; be in a logical progression.  And since some of our
routines actually use the date/time stamp to sort and *validate*
files.... there goes 1/2 of our freakin' backup, because the time stamp
on the file it just created won't match the time stamp on the file it
backed up.  The initial verification will fail.  Then the system will
generate a checksum on each file (ooohh... about 1.3 million files,
probably about 1/2 ofthem will get caught after the time change) to
compare to the original, and see it's no different.  So it adds that
filename to a log that gets emailed to me.    

In short, as a systems/network admin, this weekend is gonna *SUCK!*  

And let's not forget all the windoze workstations that'll be setting
their clocks back in 3 weeks, *again* moving the time.  *shudder*  Damn
idiot governments can't leave good enough alone.  

And to top it off, my cow-orker is on vacation in Key West this week,
drinking his butt off and fishing all day, every day.   Bastard. 

Have a happy getting-up-an-hour-earlier-even-though-the-clock-says-the-
right-time weekend!

&gt; Greetings All -
&gt; 
&gt; It's late, and I might not get home, from tomorrow until Monday,  
&gt; seeing as the new Daylight Saving Time (DST) rules affect my other  
&gt; life (called &quot;work&quot;), so I'm appealing to the Admins to allow me this  
&gt; - I'll try to make it T2 oriented...
&gt; 
&gt; So.... in my '69 Westy, I have a clock that it searches for signals  
&gt; from Boulder, Colorado's DIST-F1's Cecium-powered Atomic Clock for  
&gt; the time-of-day. Not such a big deal, eh? ... remember, I have this  
&gt; clock IN MY BUS.
&gt; 
&gt; If your BUS, like mine, has any &quot;Scheduled Tasks&quot; (or, if your BUS  
&gt; uses Unix, like mine, CRONTABS), that are scheduled for 2:01:01AM  
&gt; until 03:00:00AM, THEY WILL NOT EXECUTE on March 11th. Likewise, come  
&gt; November... things will execute TWICE if scheduled from 01:00:01 to  
&gt; 02:00:00.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, Germany never anticipated DST in the 1040's... so be  
&gt; prepared!
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
