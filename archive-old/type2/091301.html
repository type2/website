&gt; First of all a 1970 tranny is the one that has only one end bolted to

&gt; boltopenings in the top at the side where the engine is attached.

Hmmm, then there should be three general types, the early one with no rear
mount holes and no holes for the throwout bearing sleeve, the middle type
(perhaps '71 only?) with the sleeve but not the rear mount holes, and the
late type with all the holes.  Correct?
