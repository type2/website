 &quot;is there an alternative ????&quot;

Scott does pose an interesting question.  I remember seeing exhaust stubs used on the kit for installing a 1.7-2.0L in Bugs.  A custom exhaust was then connected to the stubs.  I also remember that the heating system in my '62 Bug was the &quot;non-fresh air&quot; type, and that my Uncle's Corvairs did not use an exhaust heat exchanger, but redirected heated air from the cylinders/heads into the passenger section (works real well too!).  Maybe some custom sheet metal work to do the same for a Bus?
