Subject: Re: Elecric fan engine cooling?

John-
        Pretty sure I've seen that motor in one of the VW mags. The purpose 
of the electric fans was to replace both the generator and the engine cooling 
fan. With a
small battery driving the fans, the engine could be kept cool enough after 
start up, to make a quarter mile run. The removal of the generator/fan freed 
up a few horses lost
to turning the generator, as well as a few pounds. These are considerations 
for out and out racers, but if you're gonna keep your generator/alternator 
anyway, nothing
short of a leaf-blower is probably gonna increase air flow.
        By the way, some road racers use a similar approach. Stock class 
rules indicate that the car must run with original equipment, but for a short 
race, the battery may
be sufficient to run the car, and some racers gut the generator, leaving only 
the pul-
ley and a slack belt. Again, it frees a few horses, maybe enough to win...
