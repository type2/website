Subject: RE: [T2] Bay windshield installation

&gt;I wonder if dielectric (100% silicone) grease would work as well as silicone
&gt;spray. When you say silicone spray, do you mean those cans of silicone
&gt;lubricant that you see in the same isle as WD-40?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;We have used liquid soap but prefer silicone spray.&quot;

I have stayed away from greases b/c as I understand it greases and oils 
will rot rubber. Let's just say they have an adverse effect on rubber. I 
don't have any further facts, but mostly just took it as the truth. I'd 
love to hear from anyone that knows more than I.

As for the silicone spray - yes, it's the same stuff that is shelved with 
the WD-40. Mine seems to be in yellow cans.

I was told (check this yourself) that silicone will not hurt, and can even 
be good for rubber. Amor-all comes with silicone mixed in FWTW.

I've found silicone sprayed on a rag and rubbed on rubber is very effective 
for making rubber look good.

When I use it for glass I spray it liberally on the bus window opening and 
on the rubber too. Reapply right before you install the window.
