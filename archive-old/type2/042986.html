Subject: New Gas Filler Elbows!

Thanks to fellow listee Jeff Highland- from Australia, I found a source for
NEW gas filler elbows ( part # 211 201 119)  for my '78 Bus.I figure they're
good for 15 -20 years in the hot Utah sun so I bought 2! I figure I or the
Bus will be dead by then.
Brookvale Spares in Australia provided the elbows. They're exactly like my
old one except missing a small VW logo, they're soft and pliable and they
don't have huge cracks were gallons of gas pour through at every left turn.
I don't know if they're leftover NOS or they're still being manufactured
some where, but I say get'm while they're hot!
I was pestering the hell out of Graham Lees. He was the one who responded to
all my inquiries at Brookvale Spares. After sending him my credit card # via
e-mail (that made me a little nervous) I received them in less than a week.
They are $40.00 AUD which works out to about $20.00 + $20.00 AUD shipping.
There is a nice on-line currency converter at
http://www.moto-city_dot_com/currency_files/input.html  if you want an exact
amount.
You can contact Brookvale Spares at: 38 Winbourne Road
