&gt;Amelia,
&gt;After looking at the circuit diagrams, I would suggest that the problem is 
&gt;in the emergency flasher switch. The fact that the emergency flashers work 
&gt;means that the relay that causes the flashing phenomenon is o.k. But when 
&gt;the switch is off, the circuit to power up the turn signal is supposed to be 
&gt;turned &quot;on&quot; in that position of the flasher switch. I think there is a dirty 
&gt;contact inside the flasher switch that is supposed to connect terminal #49 
&gt;and terminal #15 of that switch. I haven't tried to open such a switch to 
&gt;clean the contacts, but one thing you could try is to squirt contact 
&gt;cleaning spray inside the switch through any crack that gives you access and 
&gt;work the switch on and off to clean the contacts. Be sure to disconnect the 
&gt;negative terminal of the battery before doing this because there is 12 v at 
&gt;the switch at all times. If that doesn't work and you have nothing to lose( 
&gt;because it would require you to buy a new switch) try opening the switch to 
&gt;get a closer look at all the surfaces for cleaning.
&gt;I'll let others help out on the starting problem.

That's what worked for me with very similar symptoms.  What a pain
in the neck it is to take out that underdash AC unit to get to the
flasher. . .
