Hey all...Question??? 
First...Dave if you read this...thanks for the info on the  
fastgermanauto_dot_com...sending for the catalog...thanks again...
ok... as of today ...my 1980 vanagon is on the road...very exciting...but now 
...it's time to work out the bugs..........having trouble ...well can't get 
second gear...I think I need to replace the gear box underneath the shifting 
stick...the box has 2 brackets mounted on the inside of the box...one bracket 
is missing...1st...3rd...4th...and reverse I have...nooooooo 2nd...the 
question is??? ...do I have to replace the whole box??? or can I just get 
another bracket???...and where can I get ahold of this box ...
as I read... as I write...I think it's called the [housing for the shift 
linkage]...anyway that's what we think the problem is...any ...and I mean any 
info on this will be deeply appreciated...thanks!!!
