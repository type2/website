Subject: Rear Brake Drum on '68

Hi,

My rear brake drum is not budging at all. Seems to be rusted on nice and
tight. No give at all. I'm having trouble getting info that relates to my
'68. Does anyone know of a way to rig up a puller for this drum or if a
rental place would really have a puller that would work on this? Any advice
is appreciated.
