&gt; Finally got around to installing the old 1600 DP in my 67 project
&gt; bus.  Turns out that I have 2 dead cylinders on the engine. I am
&gt; getting no compression, as in nada, zero, nothin on #3 &amp; #4.  Ok,
&gt; this is obviously a head problem on that side, right?

how far have you dug into the engine? could the rocker arms be gone or
anything like that? I'd pull the head first and see what you see.
never know it might be something stupid.

&gt; Would you all suggest that I replace just the head just on that
&gt; side, or is it better to install 2 matching heads?  BTW, anybody got
&gt; 2 good heads??

id get 2 heads if available, if unable at least pull the heads measure
the cc volume and set the deck height correctly so that you won't
introduce any more vibration into the engine than necessary.
