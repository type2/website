&gt; A while ago there was a discussion on this list of online parts vendors that

&gt; &quot;instant, add-water-and-stir&quot; e-commerce site.  A copy of my explanation of
&gt; what's up with these sites is posted below, for those who missed it.  We can
&gt; now add yet another new site, avolkswagenpart_dot_com, to that list.

But that site is so slick!  It must be legit!  :)

I especially like the &quot;Tech Tips&quot; link that takes you to an advertisement
for a subscription &quot;online manual&quot; service run by AutoZone.  I &quot;expect&quot;
that there's lots of aircooled data there!
