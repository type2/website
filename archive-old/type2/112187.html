&gt;Hi Volks- I just checked my fire extinguisher and
&gt;found it was out of date.

Not to hijack the thread, but can anyone recommend a
good place to get a cheap fire extinguisher?  I've
been meaning to get one, but all the auto parts stores
have are chrome-plated ones at $50 a pop, and the last
few hardware stores I've checked don't carry the small
ones...Oh, and getting back to the original topic, I
was planning on making new kick panels out of 1/4&quot;
plywood, and mounting a bracket directly to those...
