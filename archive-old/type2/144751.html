Subject: Re: [T2] A really stupid question

Not a stupid question at all.
         
Federal is the opposite of California for some parts. 
Busses sold into the United States needed to meet (and
continue to meet) polution control restrictions for
the model year sold.  All vehicles were either
certified with Federal emmissions tests or the tighter
California emissions tests.
   
If your bus is 78 California model, then you would
order a `California` brain (ECU) instead of a Federal
one.  Likewise, your California model has an oxygen
sensor the federal models were not fitted with (until
a year later).   
    
How would this make a difference in part ordering? 
You would select CALIFORNIA-specific part numbers when
the choice between California and Federal is shown. 
Example:  The Brain, also known as the Electonic
Control Unit or ECU...California ECU Manual
transmission part number is 022-906-021AEX, and
California ECU Automatic transmission part number is
022-906-021AFX.  But if your vehicle had been
Non-California Emissions (like my 78 ASI/Riviera),
also known as a FEDERAL model, the Federal ECU
replacement part numbers would have been
022-906-021AGX for manual and 022-906-021AHX for
Automatic transmissions.
     
The Federal pollution control specifications were said
to be not a tight as the California specifications.

&gt; Hi Volks:
&gt; 
&gt; For my own edification, being a bit short on memory
&gt; lately, what again 
&gt; is a &quot;Federal&quot; bus?  I have a 78 CA FI and I know
&gt; what that is, but what 
&gt; is a Federal?
