Subject: engine rebuilding and 3rd gear grind

Hi, I have a 1977 bus with a stock 2.0 liter  fuel injected engine, that is 
in need of a rebuild.  This is my second bus, and i have done various things 
to fix both of them.  My question is this: With the basic mechanical 
knowledge that i have, the right tools, and many books (Bentley, Muir, Bosch 
FI book), and this list, would taking on a rebuild myself be out of the 
question?  Would doing it myself be a lot less expensive?  I know that if i 
rebuilt it myself i would learn a lot, but is it something that i should take 
on.  

One more thing: when i shift into 3rd gear there is grinding, but if i slowly 
and gently put it in 3rd i is fine.  is this a early simptom of a failing 
trans.  i have driving it maybe 6,000 miles like that, with no more problems, 
and it never pops out of gear.  and the shifter just feels sloppy in general. 
 

Any input into either of these problems would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks 
a lot.
