It does sound like a temperature related issue.  If you can keep it running
long enough for a complete warm-up and the problem goes away then you'll
know for sure.  Since it's starting up OK I wouldn't think it's a
thermo-time switch/cold start valve problem since these should only be
energized on startup and shouldn't have any effect once the key is in the
&quot;run&quot; position.  First things to check are the temp sensors.  Check 'em both
with the engine cold; do your check at the ECU plug since that'll check both
the sensors and the wiring up to the ECU.  The only other thing in the FI
system that's obviously temperature-affected is the aux air valve, though it
doesn't seem like the problem would lie there given the problem as you've
described it.

Subject: [T2] Stalls after 10 seconds?


&gt; This morning I went out to start the bus, 78' westy 2.0 FI, and it started
&gt; right up but after about 10 seconds died. I easily restarts but the only
&gt; way I can keep it running is by pumping the gas. It runs smooth and
doesn't
&gt; seem to miss, but if I try to hold the RPM constant either at a high rev
or
&gt; idle range it dies. Just shuts down no misfiring or stumbling just stops.
I
&gt; have not driven the bus in a few weeks and it was cold this morning (30F).
&gt; I last drove the bus a few weeks ago and it ran perfect all weekend. This
&gt; is the first time its ever missed a beat. I have not touched any thing
&gt; since it last ran. I am wondering if it is temperature related even though
&gt; the bus ran great last winter. I had to get to work and could not touch it
&gt; but I am going to go home for lunch and may have a look then. Perhaps its
a
&gt; cold start injector issue... Other FI cold sensitive things to check? Its
&gt; funny because it starts immediately but will not run or idle for more than
&gt; a few seconds unless I pump the gas constantly.
