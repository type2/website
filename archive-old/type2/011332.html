Subject: Re: Install snaggle on my 2L
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I ran into something like this when I was putting a 2
liter engine in place ofan 1.8 liter. The 2L size
clutch was just too big for my bellhousing, had to use
a 1.8 liter part. Have you done any swaping like that?

If not there are a two other areas to check:

1. Throwout bearing assy. It it on its forks properly?

2. Starter. Its not jamed out is it?
