&gt; Anyone have experience sleeping a family of 4 in a '71? How does that
&gt;  work? What about two (male) fishing buddies who aren't terribly
&gt;  homophobic but prefer not to sleep in each other's arms?
  
  My family of 4 just spent a week in a '70 camping throughout Utah.  I have 
two kids, 6 and 7, and the wife.  The wife and I use the Z bed, one kid on 
the top bunk and one on the child's cot up front.  I'm 6' 5&quot; so I can't sleep 
on the top bunk but I've been up there and it's held my weight (215 lbs).  I 
wasn't up there very long and I'm not sure of the actual weight limit but a 
small adult should fit.
