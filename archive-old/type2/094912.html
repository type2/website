Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Awkward Gears on a 1976 T2

	Sean(and list)

	Why would that matter ?  It's been a few years since I made the swap, but 
aside from swapping either the shift rod(hockey-stick) or the nosecone, what 
would that have to do with tough shifting in 1st and 2nd gear?  I notice 
that is is very tough when it's cold, and grows easier as she warms up. 
Also, this problem has only recently presented itself, and the transaxle has 
been in the bus since about 1992.  Has anyone else noticed this?

&gt;Eron,
&gt;Well, the '79 tranny is 1/2&quot; to 1&quot; longer than the '70 tranny so that plays
&gt;hell with the shifter adjustment.
