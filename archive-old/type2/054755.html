Subject: Re: changing gen/alt on 1600 in bus

In a 68- 71 bus, there's more than enough room to raise the fan shroud up to 
pull the alt. assy with the fan out. You wouldn't try to pull it loose from 
the fan in the bus, you'd do that when it's out. It's not really that big of 
a deal, it can be done in one hour. If it's a dp you can even pull the intake 
manifold loose for more room. I've done it plenty of times. Worse comes to 
worse,if it turns out to be too difficult, you can always still pull the 
engine.  Ed
