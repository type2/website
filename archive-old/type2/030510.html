You can get 165,000 miles out of an upright in a 71 bus, in that case my
hat is off to you. I also have a 71 bus, thought i mentioned it but i am a
bit absentminded at times.

&gt; If you want your type 1 bus to last keep your top speed around 60 MPH.

well, as i said i have over 65k on my rebuild, not to bad for a t1 pushing
a heavy bus. It runs very cool, and is totally stock. I need to do the
heads soon probably, and i expect to get at least another 40k after that
(more if i had maintianed it right... i learned a lot on this bus the hard
way.)

My indicated 70 is probably closer to an actual 65-67 i have checked my
speedo with a gps.

If you do the math with the stock ratios and stock tires, at 4100 rpm one
will be going approximately 70 MPH.  I consider that a safe cruising rpm
for a well built motor. (25.5 diameter tires, 5.375 ring and pinion.  I
couldnt remeber the exact size of the tires, so i calculated that they
were shorter than i remeber, so one is probably turning 4,000 at 70 rather
than 4100..)

Also, i go 70 if i can maintian that with partial throttle, i rarely mash
the pedal to the floor to maintain speed.

It is my humble estimation that 4100 rpm will kill a motor much slower
than heavy loads.  Push it hard, and you will kill it i agree.  But i dont
believe speed to be a good indicator of how hard a motor is being pushed
neccecarily. One can go 70 in some situations with little stress, in other
situations trying ot maintain 55 will heat your motor up right quick.

I dont neccecarily expect this motor to go a real long time as it was my
first t1 rebuild and i have made a few maintenance mistakes.  But i dont
think my tendency to go 65-70 has accelerated things too terribly much.

thanks,

Steve
