Subject: Jerry cans and spills and CARB

I just got off the phone with Dennis Goodenow at the California Air Resources Borad CARB. I talked with him about the problem with the carb approved nozzles that cause more gas to spill (and therefore fumes to escape) than without it.

They are aware of the consumer complaints and by July 2007 the regulations are going to be relaxed to remove the restriction that portable fuel container nozzles have an automatic shutoff. Good news!

I don't know exactly what this will mean but the various mfgs are going to be allowed to modify their designs to make the gas cans more user friendly. There will probably have to be a finger activated shutoff mechanism because the state doesn't want people leaving their gas cans exposed to the atmosphere (never mind that you can leave off the nozzle in your garage all together but the state feels the need to legislate common sense regardless).

Dennis told me he's talked to Wedco already and I'm going to followup with them to let them know we really need a high quality jerry can that meets the upcoming CARB regs. Crossing fingers...
