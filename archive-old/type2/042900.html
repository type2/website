&gt; Since this seems to be my weekend for vacuum problems let me add that your
&gt; problem could very well be vacuum as well.  If you don't own a vacuum
&gt; guage, go out and get one, they are &lt;$30 at any FLAPS.

Hello all,
I would second Steve's suggestion to buy a vacuum gauge, but would suggest
that you go buy a vacuum pump which handily doubles as a gauge.  I got mine
at Sears, a very nice unit.  It comes with a length of hose and a couple
hose adapters.  You can use it to pull a vacuum (how to check your
distributor advance without sucking on the hose), checking for vacuum leaks
or you can hook it up to a vacuum line, fire up the engine and it acts as a
vacuum gauge.

Mine helped me find a crapload of vacuum leaks on my '79.  Might explain the
hard starting and uneven idle, ya think?  Next project... :-)

By changing the location in the vacuum system where you attach the pump, you
can narrow down your vacuum leak source to specific locations/hoses.  Pretty
cool.
