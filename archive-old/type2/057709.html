&gt;    I don't know, I've sure never done it that way -- I take the engine
&gt;out by itself. Seems like one heck of a lot more hassle to drop the
&gt;tranny at the same time. I don't let it drop down either. Leave the
&gt;tranny in place, unbolt the engine from the tranny and unbolt the rear
&gt;member from the &quot;frame&quot; and lower it down on a tranny jack. Disconnect
&gt;everything first, of course. And then I jack the car up on each side a
&gt;bit to allow me to pull the engine out from under.

I used to do it that way, till I found out how much easier it is to drop
them together.  I can have the engine and tranny out in 45 minutes now - 30
if I'm in a hurry.  I also remove all of the exhaust because it makes the
assembly lighter and less bulky.  The first time you do it it may take a
bit longer, but once you've done it and you know that there are no
stuck/stripped bolts, you know where everything goes without labeling it,
and you have all of the proper tools, it's a piece of cake.  To make it
even faster, get an allen key for the CV bolts and chuck it up in a drill.
Break the bolts loose 1/2 turn by hand and then use the drill to whip the
12 (or 24 if you want to get the axles out of the way) bolts out in no time
flat.  Installation is the reverse of removal.  :-)

&gt;    What's the hardest for me is getting that mother back up on the jack
&gt;when I put it back in.

I usually never take it off of the jack until the tranny is unattached.  To
get the engine on/off of the jack I simply tilt it sideways about 60
degrees and roll the jack underneath as far as it will go.  Then let the
engine back down, and center it.  I do it by myself all the time, and I'm
not a real big guy (175 lbs).

You wanna talk hassle?  Getting the engine mated to the tranny with the
tranny in the bus.  That's a hassle.  It would be much easier if the rear
of the engine compartment were removeable, but we have to take what we get,
I guess.
