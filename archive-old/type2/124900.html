&gt; Looking for the intake elbow (boot) for a 1980 air-cooled vanagon.
&gt; Part# 071 129 967 (afm to throttle body)
&gt; The elbow has been replaced with the water cooled elbow part#  025 129
967a,
&gt; and the alignment and fit is very poor.  The Bus Depot paper catalog lists
the
&gt; item but it is not
&gt; found on the catalog web site.

The typical problem with these boots is that cracking starts to develop
between the ribs of the lower bend of the boot, allowing unmetered air to
enter.  If that's the issue you're facing there's a good fix available:
Automotive Goop which is similar to Shoe Goo, if you're familiar with that.
Remove the boot and clean it to within an inch of its life with hot water
and dish soap.  After it's dried, smooth on the Automotive Goop where needed
and allow to dry for a day or so.

I did this with a boot over 5 years ago and it's still going strong
