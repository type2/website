Subject: One more on heat exchangers

Steve Dolan confirmed that the fabric between the heat exchanger box and 
the bit of flashing inside is indeed asbestos. In the second exchanger I 
opened, both the flashing and the asbestos are pretty much shot.

What can I use as a substitute for the asbestos? That grey paper gasket 
material that FLAPS sell by the roll?

Thanks,

Mark HIneline
