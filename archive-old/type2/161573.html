Subject: RE: [T2] Racist

Well said Sid. I don't post much, however I must ask all of you with the stiff
objects up your backsides to get a life. I have friends of all ethnic
backgrounds and most tell me the only people who have a problem with terms
like wetback, spic, etc.. are the ones looking to impress others with the PC
view. Let it go and get back to the bus baby!!!!

Have a nice day all. &gt; Date: Wed, 4 Apr 2007 20:52:21 -0700&gt; From:
sydclarke_at_shaw_dot_ca&gt; To: type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt; Subject: [T2] Racist&gt; &gt; Gentlemen and
ladies of this list, I follow this list to become &quot;educated&quot; in&gt; the workings
of my &quot;ride&quot;, yet, I am still amazed that we collectivly love our&gt; rides, but
diseminate all we appreciate, over what are &quot;individual&gt; preferences&quot;, outside
the list items, and much as I agree that &quot;politically&gt; incorrect&quot;, is a
euphamisn of convenience, if you lined all of the list users&gt; up side by side,
and asked them what was most important, in the theme of the&gt; list, I would
hope that the first answer would be, &quot;because I have one&quot;! Let&gt; the dust
settle, appreciate what you have said, and through the &quot;aspect&quot; of&gt; freedom of
speech, let &quot;us&quot; move on! Flame shields active!&gt; Sid&gt; &gt;
