Subject: too cool?

Hey all, and hope everyone had a good turkey day!

On my 500 mile trip this week, I ran flawless (except for the horrid
bucking at the end thanks to a loose plug wire) and REALLY cool the
whole trip.  But is it too cool? Is there such a thing.  I went through
and adjusted my timing and everything a week or two ago and this has
been happening ever since.  I even get a lot of that tan foamy slimy
sludge crap in my oil filler neck cap, and in my valve covers...and
probably other places I dont see.  It went away after I was done driving
200 miles...but during that duration..it was there in full effect.  I
can pull over on the side of the road at any given time and touch the
dipstick with no problems.  I could even lick it.  thats how cool it
is.  It just feels like normal room temperature.  It used to get so hot
i could barely hang on to it.  Whats goin on here? I figure its a good
thing...so i just leave it...

any input?

Thanks!
