&gt;&gt;Anyone ever used one of these (Uhaul dolly) to tow a bus?&lt;&lt;

Yep, I towed a '66 camper 319 miles behind a S*baru wagon.  Very important: When you pick it (the dolly) up, make sure you have the newer type dolly that has a pivoting &quot;deck&quot; on top of the trailer frame, under where the towed vehicle wheels goes. Doesn't make much of a difference when it's loaded with the bus, but when it is empty it makes a huge difference.  The older, lighter style will bounce all over the road when it is empty.  The newer type with the heavier deck trails much nicer.  I've towed buses with both types, and it is a huge deal.  When I had the lighter dolly, I actually had to stop and buy 4 ninety pound bags of concrete and strap them to the trailer just to keep it on the pavement.  Good luck!

Peace, John Baker
