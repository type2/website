Subject: Bus drivers and waving.

G'day All!

I have a '74 and '85 bus, well the '85 is my Dad's, but guess who drives 
it most!

Anyway, I really like how type2 bus drivers wave to each other on the road,
(well, the old shape bus...whatever...) but I noticed that the drivers of 
buses in the shape like the '85 we have never wave at each other....not 
even a second glance!

I remember when we first bought the '85 (in '85 of course!) it was only 
one of two or three (I believe) around town.  It was a bit of a novelty 
then, until more of them showed up.  Now, with the even newer shape of 
buses, I never see them waving!

What's going on?

On another topic, I am new to this group, and to American terminology for 
the buses.  The '85 we have is a Caravelle and I think someone told me 
you Americans call it a Eurovan.

So, what is a westfalia?

I am basically familiar to the extent of knowing that there were/are 
three &quot;shapes&quot; The old &quot;curvey&quot; one (well, there was the old 23 window 
one too!) like my '74.  Then, the more &quot;chunky&quot; shape like my '85 (and 
the really cool syncros) and now, the new front engine one.

Help bring me up to speed....

Thanks,

Darren.
