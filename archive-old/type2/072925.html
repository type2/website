Subject: JOSH RODGERS

As with so many of us on the list, I never met him face to face but I
considered him a friend I'd never met, the same way I feel about so many of
my &quot;electronic friends&quot; on this list. Josh messaged me a couple of time
with advice and tips that were dead on and solved that moment's problems.
I'm not blessed with the eloquence that would allow me to express the sense
of loss I am experiencing. I just know that I will miss him.

I hope that he has found the peace that escaped him here because his
passing is a loss for all of us.

Go easy Bro,
Skip Correll
Chattanooga, Tn
