Subject: Re: [T2] bee expert needed

I only know that if you allow bees to remain on that shelf or move them to 
another, sooner or later someone is going to get stung regardless of how 
nicely you treat the bees.
It is their nature to sting.
Get rid of the bees or keep em well away from you.
Either way be careful.

Are we actually talking about bees or was that a metaphor for some other 
unnamed evil?
