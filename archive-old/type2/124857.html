Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster Line

From: &quot;David Bell&quot; &lt;bellky_at_charter_dot_net&gt;
&gt; I've had a weird thing happen twice in the last week. My brake booster
line
On two
&gt; separate ocassions when starting the bus this cap has blown off the line
&gt; creating a huge vacuum leak.

Hi David
Usually this is from a Back fire pop,,, and /. or a loose rubber boot,,,
replace your rubber boot, and check you vac level with a gauge. The gauge
should be above 15hg at idle and steady.  If it is fluctuating,, adjust your
valves, and check the vac level again.

Hope that helps
