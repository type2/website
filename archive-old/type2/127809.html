Subject: Electrical &quot;mystery&quot; possibly solved

I think I may have figured it out. It may very well be the grounding strap for the battery. I have always had good readings from it, but I had always tested it before I had a load on it. Today I tested it while turning the key and the voltage dropped to 0 when testing from the body. It is still 12 across the terminals, but not from the body to the positive terminal. Therefore I am going to fork over the 8 bucks and see if that gets her running. Maybe some goblin came by one night and installed a breaker in the strap. The strap looks like new so I had never thought it was the problem...so here goes...
 
Many many thanks to everyone for helping me out...
