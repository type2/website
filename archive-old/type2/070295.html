Subject: more questions.....

Hi all
I have recently aquired a '74 bus and I have some questions
regarding it. I have found at a local junkyard a sliding door
window that cranks open(jaulosy sp?). The bus is a 68-72.
will this fit in my bus. I would like to be able
to get more airflow to my kids in the back. We are not looking
for a complete resto but a good functional vehicle so the
fact that this is not origonal is not an issue.
        Next The same bus has a tighter steering box than
mine and I would like to know if they are compatable. The guy
said he'd sell it for $25 if I pull it, and looking at the 
prices of rebuilt ones in RMMW (~ $280) this seems like
a steal.
        I am familiar with the upright engine but this is
my first experience with the pancake. what is an easy
way to rotate the engine so I can check the valves. The
nut for the alternater is in a space too tight for my 
socket. Do I need to buy an open end of this size?
Is it a 22mm?
        I thank all of you for the information and knowlege
I have gained as a result of being on this list. I look forward
to the day when I can help instead of always being helped.
Thanks............Chip
