Hey All,

I've got a new problem with my '69 Westy and it's driving me nuts!

When I go to start the bus, it will turn over and begin to run until I
let go of the key, then it dies. If I hold the key in a slightly
forward-rotated position (not so far that the starter turns), it will
run and THEN I can let go of the key. It seems to have a &quot;sweet spot&quot;.

I'm pretty sure it's the switch itself and not electrical as the
problem goes away when I hold the key in the aforementioned
&quot;sweet-spot&quot;.

Any ideas? Anyone have a good switch (gotta have the VW key, too!!!)
for sale?


Lemme know.


Jaime
