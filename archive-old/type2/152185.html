&gt; After some deep soul searching, talking to the wife, etc, I've decided that
&gt; the Bus Karma is not with me for the GWB. So I'm putting it up for sale.
&gt; (No, I'm not leaving VWs. I still have the 71 in the garage that I'm going
&gt; to hang on to for the moment.)

why not take the 71 and tow GWB to the garage...?? leave there until you
can figure out how to handle it.......park it safe and take a breather...
