&gt;traveling with my A.I.R.S. list).
&gt;
&gt;Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated,

Dear Juan,

We've driven to Yellowstone through South Dakota from the other direction
(from Wisconsin) the past four summers (we're going back this summer for
two weeks in Yellowstone). I agree with everyone's said about being
prepared, driving slowly, etc. Some hints about travel:

1) Yellowstone is a must experience. I think the problem most people have
with it is what they perceive as its &quot;touristiness.&quot; What we've found (and
we spend at least ten days there) is that if you try to &quot;do&quot; Yellowstone in
the typical stay of slightly less than two days, you end up stuck in all
the touristy places. The longer you stay, the less pressure to &quot;see
everything,&quot; and, ironically, the less relevant the distraction caused by
other tourists. The hot springs, geysers, waterfalls, rivers, animals are
all worth seeing even with your fellow tourists. Also, it's a good idea to
try to schedule your visits to the various points of interest to correspond
to a ranger-guided tour (almost always free); the guide you're given when
you enter the park lists all these tours. I've never been to a bad or
uninteresting one, and the kids always like them. The interpretive rangers,
by the way, are really good with kids. If you can go on a tour with John
Rhodes, do it: you'll get an excellent, insightful, amusing tour by a guy
who quotes classical Roman philosophers among others. When I grow up, I
want to be like him. Also, if you eat in the Hamilton stores, the
breakfasts are pretty good, and the best buy for lunch or dinner is the
taco or burrito plate.

Some hints for ways to avoid the tourist crunch at Yellowstone:
a) Get to the Upper Geyser Basin (and Old Faithful) as early in the day as
possible. They are more and more people there as the day goes on. Although
seeing an eruption of Old Faithful at dusk is pretty spectacular, even with
the crowd! Also, seeing Old Faithful from Observatory Hill (a short but
somewhat strenuous hike) eliminates a fair amount of the tourist crowd, and
gives a great view.

b) There's about a four-mile, just about flat hiking trail from the road
just south of the Upper Geyser Basin to Lone Star Geyser, which is a large,
ancient cone geyser in the middle of the woods. Check at the Old Faithful
ranger station to see when it might be erupting (it erupts about every
three hours). It's a beautiful and easy hike, along the Firehole river.
Last year we saw a mother and newborn baby moose walking through the river.
Staying quiet and keeping our distance, we were able to watch them for a
good fifteen minutes.

c) Another nice hike is the old supply road that goes from the Fountain
Flats area and Ojo Caliente to Biscuit Basin (you can also go to Fairy
Falls off of this trail). You go past a large number of hot springs and
geysers, and since you have to walk there, there are fewer people. You can
scramble up a hill to get a bird's-eye view of Grand Prismatic Spring.

4) Nice drives: If you have the time, and the bus is up to it :-), you
couldn't do better than to drive out through the northeast entrance through
Cooke City, and on the Beartooth Hwy, either north to Red Shirt, MT, or
south to Cody, WY. Unbelievably beautiful road! Then take the east entrance
back into the park (from Cody) over Sylvan Pass. Teddy Roosevelt called the
drive from Cody through the Wapiti valley to the east entrance the most
beautiful road in America.

5) Staying in Madison campground in the park is nice: it's not too far (14
miles) and an easy drive to West Yellowstone, MT, which is a decent place
to get resupplied; two grocery stores, a drug store, an excellent bakery
(Jocee's), not to mention the ubiquitous golden arches. Madison campground
is also about 16 miles from the Upper Geyser Basin and Old Faithful. Don't
go to the Fishing Bridge RV camp; it's really set up for the humongous
Greyhound-sized RVs. You'll feel like an ant at a steam-roller convention.

6) It would help to get some sort of guide book before going to
Yellowstone. Planning is good.

7) Another nice stop nearby is Thermopolis, WY, about 90 miles south of
Cody. Thermopolis is the home of the world's largest mineral hot spring. We
stay at a private campground called Country Campin' (about $15 a night)
about five miles outside of town. It was formerly part of a ranch and is
family-owned and run. The folks who run it are very kind and friendly.
Although most of it is set up for RVs, there's a nice section that's
grassed next to a small creek that's perfect for us (and people in tents).
They also have teepees, if you're interested. We stay in Thermopolis both
ways. It's a good place to relax and recover; it's very laid-back, and
there's a real grocery store in town. The hot springs in town are worth
going to. There are two private areas that are waterparks (pools, hot tups,
water slides, etc) and a public area. It's our first longer stop on our way
out west, and we find the hot baths to be therapeutic and refreshing. Bring
your water shoes if you go to the hot springs!

8) Tensleep Pass (in WY) over the Bighorns is a spectacular drive.

9) We don't go to Mt. Rushmore. We're patriotic, but we know what the
mountains mean to the native people there and prefer not to go (it's ok if
you want to go! :-) ). We do go to Crazy Horse, just outside Custer, which
has a great display of Native American history, culture, and art. They
often have artists creating, displaying, and selling their works.

10) The Grand Tetons are really beautiful. Also, it's worth renting a boat
(or a canoe) on Jackson Lake and spending a day tooling around the lake.
You will get poster-quality pictures.

11) Wind Cave National Park has a small campground that costs about $10 a
night,and has a resident herd of bison. It's about 6 miles north of Hot
Springs, SD, which has a operational woolly mammoth dig that was discovered
during excavation of an apartment complex about 25 years ago: worth the
visit. The caves at Wind Cave and Jewel Cave are both worth visiting. If
you want to spend a little more money, and be surrounded by more tourists,
you can stay at Custer State Park, which is just north of Wind Cave (about
15 miles south of Cody), which also has a bison herd. The drive through the
Needles Highway in the park is spectacular (if you don't camp in Custer
State Park, you have to pay a fee to drive in the park).

12) If you camp in tents or in your bus, the biggest problem is finding
showers. Think about daily sponge baths in the bus (we do it). In
Yellowstone, you can buy showers at Fishing Bridge and at the Old Faithful
Lodge (not the log Inn or the Snow Lodge). They're not cheap, but they're
there. We schedule shower stops into our planning; last year at Old
Faithful Lodge, while waiting for my wife to come out of the shower, me, my
son, and his friend saw Old Faithful erupt at dusk. Also, you can shower at
private campgrounds.

13) We bring along a a small nylon tent for the kids to sleep in if they
want (we have a high-top Westy). It gives them (and you!) some privacy.

14) About reliability: we've had problems each year we've driven out,
including the year we took our F*rd Taurus. We're coming close to accepting
them as part of the journey. In each case, while fixing the bus, we've met
people whom we've treasured meeting. One way to see whether it's a good
idea is to plan a weekend camping trip in which you drive the maximum
distance you plan to travel this summer. You won't find many VW-competant
mechanics in either South Dakota or Wyoming, so come prepared with manuals
(Bentley and Muir are required, I think), and at least basic tools and
spare parts. Also bring along tools that will be unlikely for non-VW
mechanics to have, like the 17mm allen wrench for removing the tranny
filler and drain bolts.

15) Since we stay so long in Yellowstone, we rent a car (this year in Cody)
to drive around Yellowstone. That way we can leave our bus parked in
camping mode while we're visiting the park. The bus gets enough of a
workout climbing in the mountains anyway! It deserves a vacation, too.

16) Having decent tires and brakes is critical. You'll be climbing and
descending mountain passes, often in foggy, rainy, or even snowy weather.
The last place you'll want to find out that your tires are inadequate is at
that sharp turn on Sylvan Pass (you'll know which one I mean when you see
it)!

Whew... a little longer than I planned. We love our annual trip, and can't
wait to rumble out again in Guactoo this June. Let me know if you have any
questions.

Best of luck, and happy trails!
