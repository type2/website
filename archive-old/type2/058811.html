&gt;VW DEVELOPS LIGHT FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLE .... Volkswagen is &gt;developing
a
&gt;light-weight carbon-fiber fuel-efficient car, &quot;The Detroit News&quot;
reports.
&gt;The new car will weigh less than 1,320 pounds and use less than three
&gt;liters of fuel per 100 kilometers. The car is expected to be in
&gt;production within a few years.

Also known as a S.U.V. speedbump.
