Gauges are good for baseline readings, and to see very quick fluctuations,
that mean trouble is on the way..

Even aircraft gauges are inaccurate, to a certain point, especially those
used in military aircraft. We never really worried alot about readings from
them, unless they read super high, or had a big change all of a sudden....
