Subject: RE:  Weber 40DCNF carbs

&gt;Recent joiner. Just bought a very nice 83 Westy with what appears
&gt;to be a dropped seat. I have a good 76 2.0 engine with 40 DCNF 
&gt;carbs and assume it will fit with the 83 tin but will need a new exhaust 
&gt;system at a horrific price. No Smog check here in FL so could use 
&gt;aftermarket stuff but what about heat exchanger match up? Also, what 
&gt;is the consensus about the Webers? I have 2 complete FI systems 
&gt;and can go either way.
&gt;I have researched the archives and library but found little re the
&gt;Webers. All advise appreciated.

Dual Webers rock!  I ran dual IDF's (very similar to the DCNF's) on my 73
1.8 bus for 8 years and on my 2.0 914 for 3 years.  Now both of them have
2.0 with d-jet FI.  I like the FI better because it is quieter, gives me
better gas mileage, starts and run easy in the cold, and doesn't have the
permanent gas smell in the engine compartment like the dual Webers always
seem to.  But bottom line is, the Webers provide great performance, are easy
to adjust and tune, and leave the engine compartment very clean and
uncluttered.

The exhaust system issue may present a problem, though.  The 80-83 Vanagons
heads have square exhaust ports with off-set bolts which makes them
completely incompatible with 72-78 heat exchangers or headers.  I'd say the
only 2 possibilities are to see if a 72-78 exhaust sytem will fit under the
Vanagon or else you'll have to put the V'gon heads on your 76 motor.
