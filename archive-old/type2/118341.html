Subject: Pierburg Carb Question

Happy new year all.

This isn't quite Type 2 but I'm at wits end. Anyone out there have any
information/parts resources for a Pierburg Type 1B Carb that I've pulled off
of a farm tractor I'm working on with a VW 1.8L water cooled A2 engine? I
think it's similar to a Solex 1B3 carb, but not sure.

Just email me off list if you have any places to suggest. I was hoping that
this carb was similar enough to the solexes used in Type 2s.

Thanks!
