Subject: Re: [T2] NAPA  ball joint snafu

I've always had VERY good luck with parts, service, AND advice from NAPA
auto parts. The store I go to locally in Fort Lauderdale has very
knowledgeable people. They're all usually over 50 years old, are retired,
and this is their fun job. Of course, 99% of what I've purchased there has
been either parts or tools that I've needed or used specifically for
American cars (Pontiac Fiero, Trans Am, Grand Am, etc). 

 

But I've ALWAYS had good service from them. They've always steered me in the
right direction. Never ONCE have I had a bad experience there.

 

On the other hand, Pep Boys (for those who live in the South), I've had
usually bad experiences. Pep Boys is a large SuperStore chain of parts
stores in the south. For you northerners, I guess this would be like Super
Track &amp; Auto??

 

The only thing that Pep Boys REALLY specializes in, is selling riceboy
parts. Things like Altezza tail lamps for Ford Windstar Minivans, Dodge
Neons, and Volkswagen Jettas. Or light-up neon shift knobs for automatic
transmissions... seat covers, floor mats, and trashy &quot;GET OUT OF MY WAY&quot;
Disney character stickers and mud-flaps.

 

NAPA... they don't sell ANY of that garbage. They sell CAR PARTS, not
&quot;accessories&quot;.
