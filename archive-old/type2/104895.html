Subject: FI Pressure Regulator - Good Link, Sorry

Smelled a bit of fuel and peeked around, found this on my '79:

http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/

It appears that I have fuel (not a lot) loose around the pressure
regulator.  It looks like it's equally on both sides of the
regulator...  Has my regulator gone?  Do these clamps work loose?

I had all fuel lines replaced about 2 years ago when one of the injector
hoses sprung a mist, at a shop in Gilroy that I thought rocked.  Did
they likely not replace ALL the hoses?  Guess I should do that now? 
Seems like if they did I shoulda got a bit more mileage out of it.

&quot;I replace the FI fuel line with Mercedes EFI fuel hose. It is 7.5mm.   
2
to 3 meters should do all except the 10mm hose between the pump and
filter.
The Mercedes hose clamps work just like the original VW clamps.&quot;

Do I really need to replace the clamps?  Are these original?  They look
okay to me... 

Guess I could tighten it all up and see if it's still leaking, but I'm
paranoid and would rather do it all if there's any reason to do so.

Thanks, wise listees!
