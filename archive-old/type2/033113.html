Subject: Re: Heater blower motor/PDX parts places

&gt;&gt; I too have had excellent help &amp; service from Halsey.  We have lost a few
places in recent years.  Parts Barn &gt;&gt; was a good place.  Oh well.  Have a
great Thanksgiving.

Yes, although a little off the beaten path for those of us bussers living
&quot;close-in&quot; to Portland, Halsey Automotive has never failed to have the
parts I need when I need them.  Always V-Dub is a good place too in town,
although they moved off the beaten path as well.  Just FYI.
