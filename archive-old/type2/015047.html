Subject: Dash lights
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey people:

I have a '68 single cab.

 The problem is the dash lights, brake warning light, high beam indicator
and gas gauge do not work. In fact the only dash lights that work on the
dash is the oil pressure light and the left turn signal indicator light(the
right front turn signal does not work, so I am assuming that this is that
problem).

 I have cleaned all the contacts on the fuse box and replaced all the
fuses. The only mod that is obvious is that the PO put on a generic
ignition switch to by pass the faulty stock ignition switch.

Would a faulty ground on the back side of the dash make ALL of these items
not work? Are all these items on the same ground plane? I have made a
cursory check at the connections on the back of the dash(brown gnd
wires)and all seemed fine but I really didn't know where the main ground
wire from the back of dash to ground is?

Thanks for your help!!

Vic
