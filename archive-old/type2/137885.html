Subject: Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

Hi Volks!

It was all very fine and hypothetical when I was trying to help
someone else solve the gas in oil riddle, but now it's all very
different because now there is gas in MY oil!

73 Westy, stock, dual carbs. As you may recall, I recently learned
that a sticking valve in the carb can cause the gas in the tank to
siphon into the engine, running past rings and filling the crankcase.

When I obtained this bus a couple of months ago, it was initially a
light user of oil due to small oil spotting, apparently from pushrod
tube seals. It took a while for enough oil to be lost to add, but
finally I added a half quart, drove a while, and added another half
quart.

After my last post on my getting only 4 mpg from this bus and learning
of the gas in oil issue, I learned to observe for increasing amounts
of oil in the crankcase. So the other day I checked the oil and found
it just slightly above the full mark, maybe 1/16 to 1/8 inch. So I
thought maybe I wasn't too accurate on my last oil add, and also the
parking space at work I was in when checking wasn't perfectly level,
so I thought I'd just keep an eye on it.

Well, this morning, decided to check oil before taking off. I'm parked
on a good level spot in my driveway, and lo and behold, I am about 2
1/2 inches over the full mark, maybe 2 to 3 inches max deviation. I
couldn't smell gas in the oil, but my wife said she could smell it.

So I moved to a spot on my front lawn where I could work on the bus
out of the way in case I found I needed parts and wouldn't block the
wife's car.

I pulled the carbs apart and found the float level and needle valve
appeared to be good in the  left carb. In the right carb, the needle
valve also appeared to be good, but the fuel level was about 2 mm too
low.

Testing the needle valve as I blow air through a hose I attached to
the fuel inlet tube while moving the needle up and down to check for
sealing action.

The other oddity is after letting the engine sit for a while as I tore
down the carbs, I went back to check the oil level to report to you
volks, and found it only read 1/2 inch over full. The spot on the lawn
isn't as level as the driveway. The front wheels are parked on the
front walkway about 2 inches higher than the rear wheels. That
wouldn't explain such a difference in oil measurement would it? Or
maybe it takes longer for the oil to settle down? Or maybe some is
trapped in a valve cover?

So my biggest question is, if you all agree the needle valve and float
level are not the problem here, is there someplace else the fuel could
be leaking through the carb?

I remember some previous discussion about a check ball that corrodes
and doesn't seat. Could that explain the gas in the oil? If so, where
do I find it and how do I service it?

Any other explanations? Could fuel seep through a ruptured diaphram?
Maybe there was just dirt in the needle valve, and by blowing cleaner
through it, maybe I restored the needle valves to functionality?

Thanks in advance for any help.
