Subject: Re: [T2] It is Friday

Bob,

This has *got* to be a joke.

Having grown up in west Texas, I can't imagine anyone in the lone Star 
state voting for 55 again.

The howls of anguish during the prohibition like move to 55mph during the 
oil shortage could be heard all across the state.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; Governor Rick Perry is interested in finding out what Texans think about
&gt; the speed limit roll back to 55 miles and hour from 70. Please call Governor
&gt; Perry's office (1-800-252-9600) and let them know. You may have to hold for
&gt; a minute, but you will speak with a live person. It's fast and easy. You
&gt; can also vote at
&gt; &lt;http://www.texasmotorists_dot_org/speed_limits/default.asp&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Please pass this on to as many Texans as possible.
