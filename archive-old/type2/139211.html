Subject: RE: [T2] instrument panel lights, wedge base LED

Barry and the list,

Here's an even better deal, also from Mouser:

http://www.mouser_dot_com/?No=10&amp;handler=data.listcategory&amp;Ne=400&amp;terms=wedge+ba
se+led&amp;Ntt=*wedge*%2b*base*%2b*led*&amp;crc=false&amp;Ns=MfgrPartNumber%7c%7cSField&amp;
N=435

More light output, and 1/5 to 1/10 the price (at $1.34 in lots of ten for
white, they're even cheaper than the incandescents).

Read the specs closely, i.e. half the viewing angle (30 degrees vs. 60
degrees) = triple the mcd &quot;output&quot; while everything else stays the same.
Unfortunately, this is another area where it'll be difficult to compare LEDs
to incandescents... incandescents spread their mcd over something like 300
degrees, roughly a thousand times that of the narrow beam LED.

I'd guess some of that gets reflected out the top of the bulb (the only part
you see when it's mounted in the instrument panel), so let's guess (and
that's all this is at the moment, a &quot;shot in the dark&quot;) that you'd need
around 900% more mcd in an incandescent to equal that of the 30 degree LED.

But that's unfiltered. Incandescents throw off gobs of energy in the red end
of the spectrum, and I suspect a white LED throws off very little, hence
you'd get less LED light transmission through the filter.  You'd be better
off with a red led behind a red filter, green for green, etc. A whole nuther
nut in the works.

Mouser's part number 697-01TWB9WB12 (white, 30 degree visibility) has a
rated mcd of 11,000, that's at 12v, dissipating .036 watts. If my _guesses_
are close, you'd need an incandescent output of around 90,000 to 100,000 mcd
for an equivalent.

It is possible that these may not work in the turn signal indicator, as the
flasher may think the bulb is burned out. A heavy duty &quot;towing&quot; flasher may
work in this application, if one is available that will fit the VW.

I've been looking for more than half an hour on the internet to find the mcd
output of the proper incandescent lamp. Unfortunately I am confined to my
bedroom at this time, or I'd drive down to the FLAPS and look at a package.
That'll be your comparison. I'd love to know if any one has that info.

&gt; Can someone look up 'candela' at www.dictionary_dot_com and relate
&gt; any of the 12
&gt; volt LEDs at the above web site with watts.  450 millicandelas[mcd] = how
&gt; many watts?  Thanks
