&gt; Hmm. How does the tank work? I would expect the fuel to be pumped from the
&gt; bottom, so after settling, you'd want a few days for other chumps to buy the

Gee, shucks...

In answer to your question, the storage tank does not draw exactly from
the bottom.  It has a sump built in to allow water and other dense
impurities to settle out.  These are drained via a separate tap.

Oddly enough, your bus has a similar setup.  The fuel outlet has a tube
that extends an inch or so into the tank, which makes the bottom inch of
fuel inaccessable.  If you pick up some water or grunge, it will remain
below the outlet level and not be sucked up by the engine.  Unfortunately,
the water will also rust your tank!

You can get rid of the water by adding a pint or so of fuel drier (usually
pure methanol) to the fuel.  It is soluable with water and will allow it
to pass harmlessly through the fuel system in small doses.
