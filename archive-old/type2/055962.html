Subject: My bus is (finally) home.

I am exhausted. At last, I have dragged my bus home. My apologies for this long
post, but I am bored: sitting at work on a Sunday morning wishing I was home
pulling the engine out of my new toy.

To make a long story short, last summer I bought a '79 bus that was sitting in
the woods at a summer camp in northern Michigan. I was living in Ohio at the
time and thought that over the course of the summer I could fiddle with it, get
it running (it hadn't been started in almost 3 years), and limp it home: 280
miles away. By the end of the summer I hadn't gotten too far with it as I prefer
to play guitar, canoe, and drink beer when I go camping (especially after the 5
hour drive north every other weekend). Sanity spoke to me briefly, and I decided
that I should put it on a trailer if I was to take it home, so my attention
turned toward that goal. 

Turmoil at work played havok with my time that summer; and heck, things just
didn't work out, so the bus sat all winter. Fortunately I didn't drag it home to
Ohio, because in February I moved to southwest Michigan. Moving it would have
been a pain.

Well, this spring I was asked to extract it by June, so I put my plans in place.
Weekends are precious and few, thanks to the occasional ones I'm required to
work for my new job, but I managed to plan a trip north the 9th of May to get
the bus. Got my reservation in to U-Haul for a truck and trailer (my Ford Escort
doesn't have the umph! to pull much of anything, but you already knew that)
three weeks in advance. I made arrangements with my brother to show up at the
camp where the bus was sitting (a five hour drive for him) so he could help load
it up. Called the rental place the day before our trip and they said everything
was ready to go. Whoo-who, we're gonna get the bus! May 9th comes, the wife and
I head out early, drive five hours, get to the U-Haul rental center in Grayling,
MI  by 11am and what are the first words out the mouth of the folks working
there? &quot;We don't have your truck.&quot; I just about had to pull my wife off the poor
guy; she wanted blood.

Thankfully, I was refunded the rental cost and my deposit; but ten hours in the
car can surely kill a Saturday.

Made new plans. This time, I was shooting for yesterday, the 6th of June. The
very last day that I could leave the bus where it was. Learned my lesson with
U-Haul and rented a truck and trailer close to home from Penske (very nice,
clean, and the truck only had 3500 miles on it before I got it). Picked it up
Friday. Talked the wife into heading out to my Grandmother's house almost half
way to our destination in order to cut down our Saturday driving time. Got half
way to my Grandmother's place and realized that I had forgotten the keys to the
bus! Argghh!!! By this point, my wife is starting to suspect that the bus
cursed. I start to worry about things that I'll have to do to repay her (take
her to the ballet, take her shopping for expensive new clothes, or take her out
to her favorite Chinese restaurant every week for a year, etc. :-).

Stayed home Friday night to avoid adding any slaughter to Michigan's highways of
carnage (I have never before seen so many dead animals on the road in all of my
29 years). Left early in the morning (with the keys!) and made it to our
destination without incident. Spend two hours fiddling with the bus, trying to
get it started. I'm new to this, but I gave it my best shot: a new battery,
fresh fuel, and some additional oil. I managed to get the fan to start and the
cylinoid to kick, but nothing else. Fuel lines looked dry and I know absolutely
nothing about EFI, so I decided that dragging the bus on to the trailer was the
only thing I could do at this point. I'll spare you the details since I'm lucky
that nobody got killed (note to self: next time bring a winch), but we spent
another hour pushing, pulling, and cursing the bus on the trailer and hit the
road. [Today, I ache. Four years of being a computer jockey have really knocked
me out of shape. I didn't know I had muscles in some of the places that I hurt!]

Ride home was smooth, even on Michigan's crappy roads. Pulled in an hour or two
earlier than expected last evening, spent close to another hour getting the bus
off the trailer and sitting in the yard next to the barn, in a spot where I hope
the landlady won't have too much of a problem with it. I can't wait to dive into
it!

Yes, Bethanne, my wonderful wife, weathered the experience well. Though she's
entirely convinced now that the bus is cursed and wanted to be left alone. I
promised her a shopping spree when she finishes up spring semester in three
weeks, so I may have salvaged some of her respect for my goofy projects. Now,
how do I convice her that we should join the Tierra del Fuego, Argentina trip in
2000 with this bus?

I've got plenty of questions for you folks and I'm sure I'll come up with many
more in the next few months. Get ready!

Thanks for reading,

Frederick
