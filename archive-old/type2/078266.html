Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Another way to warm the seal is put it in a pillow case and throw it in the
dryer for a couple minutes on low.

&gt; thanks for the replys everyone. i guess i should have been more descriptive
&gt; on my initial post.
&gt;
&gt; suggestions that came up but that i had already tried:
&gt; -get the seal warm
&gt; -have another person help from the outside
&gt;
&gt; suggestions that i have not tried yet:
&gt; -silicone spray on the seal
&gt; -starting on the bottom edge of the window is easier
&gt; as far as 'wire', actually i used some speaker wire split in half. i dont
&gt; know the guage but its not that thick. i used the same type of wire for the
&gt; other seals i installed a few years ago on a 73 super beetle &amp; it worked
&gt; pefectly.
&gt;
&gt; thanks again &amp; keep the suggestions coming.
&gt;
&gt; its supposed to be really warm tomorrow so i think i'll leave it in the sun
&gt; all day &amp; give it a go when i get home from work tomorrow.
