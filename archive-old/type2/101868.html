Doesn't sound unreasonable.  The engine in my '66 (now two years old!) is
built to 7.5:1 and it runs a tad hotter then I'd like at extended highway
speeds.  (no matter how rich or lean I make it.)

Next one I build will probably be closer to 7.0:1.  Or maybe I'll do if
the heads have to come off in the future.
