&gt;Ya'll may remember my discovery that my intake manifold nuts were

Did you retune the carbs because now you've eliminated a big leak? 

&gt;All 8 of 'em were loose! I torqued to 15ftlbs (didn't look up the 
&gt;spec. Probably should..hehe) when I installed them. Either I suck at 
&gt;torque or they worked themselves loose. No biggie. Retorqued them. One 
&gt;stud is backing itself out. I tightened it as well as I dared without 
&gt;pulling everything back apart. It's sealed, but I couldn't get over 10 
&gt;ftlbs. Left it for now. 

I had the same problem with the dual solex manifolds and carbs. The vibration keeps loosening those nuts and I had to use some loctite to secure them once and for all.
