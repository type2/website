jeff,

do you want to balance the engine?

here is what i know about how it is done:

first of all, the entire rotating mass is balanced at the same time. i have
watched it done at the shop that does balancing for me. first the crank is
mounted in the machine which looks a bit like a lathe with a computer
attached to it. the crank is first balanced to itself, which means removing
material by drilling holes in various locations. once the crank is balanced,
the next part is added, which is usually the flywheel. then the pressure
plate is attached and it is balanced. the fan hub is also installed and the
fan attached and balanced. at this point all the rotating parts are in
balance and also are indexed to each other. they are marked with a number
stamp and a bit of red paint (except the fan which has only one index
point). they must be assembled in index or the balance will be upset. by the
same token, if the flywheel is ground (after balancing), it should be
re-balanced. if you change pressure plates, the new pressure plate should be
balanced. 

this is the only way to balance the engine rotating parts, and it can't be
done at home, afaik.

as for the rods, they are balanced one by one for equal weight and end for
end, this is done in a separate process from the rest of the parts. it is
possible to do this one at home:

there are other site similar to this one.
