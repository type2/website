Subject: '81 compression update &amp; questions

Hey all,
Well the '81 is still giving me fits.  

It's still running too hot.  I'm trying to find out why.  I had recently
replaced the small vacuum hoses on my air-cooled engine and last night I
replaced the larger vacuum hoses (which were in pretty bad shape) with
good ones from my spare engine.  The hoses I replaced are the two fabric
hoses attached to the deceleration valve, the hose from the S-boot to
the auxiliary air regulator and the hose from the air regulator to the
air distribution box.

Tomorrow I'm going to the local VW FLAPS and getting a complete set of
the fuel injector seals (possible vacuum leak source) and the four very
large very short sections of braided hose that connect the air
distribution box to the four pipes on top of the engine.  While I'm in
there, are there any other possible vacuum leak sources I should check
out?  What about the intake air pipe - to - cylinder head gaskets.  Do
those need periodic replacement?

As far as compression, here's the deal.  Number 1 is still kinda iffy. 
I've found that if I adjust the valves as they should be (hydraulic
lifters, remember -- contact + 1 turn), then I get very low
compression.  If I adjust them to contact + 1/2 turn, I get better
compression and if I take them to contact + &quot;a little more&quot; then I get
quite good compression.  However, I feel like the fact that I can't get
decent compression when I have the valves adjusted like they're supposed
to be indicates that I have a somewhat serious valve-related problem. 
I'm beginning to suspect a receding valve seat on number 1 exhaust. 
I've noticed that when I adjust both valves for #1 to the same spot,
then the adjuster screw for the exhaust valve sits with more threads
showing than the intake valve adjuster.  It also appears that the stem
for the exhaust valve is sitting up higher than that of the intake
valve.  I tried the straight edge test but I'm not sure it told me
anything one way or the other.

Basically, is there anything else I can do with the engine in the car to
further diagnose this problem or is the above information enough to tell
those in the know what sort of problem I have?  Any info will be
appreciated.

Thanks,
