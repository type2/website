Subject: Re: [T2] Belt-eating crank pulley

&gt; Still working on this 1500 SP. I noticed that the
&gt; inside surface of the crank pulley is pitted and rough
&gt; from sitting so long before I got it.  It tends to
&gt; shred belts! So, is putting on a new crank pulley as
&gt; easy as putting a flywheel lock on, removing the
&gt; pulley bolt and simply slapping another one on, or is
&gt; it more involved??  Anybody have any tips for this
&gt; job??  How many PSI is that sucker supposed to be
&gt; cranked to??

You may not even need a flywheel lock if you are lucky, as it should only
be torqued to 32 foot pounds.  However some folks take a look at that big
nut and think that the torque should be a lot more.  Put a long wrench on
it and give it a whack with the heel of your hand and see if it breaks
loose.

If your luck continues, the pulley may slide right off.  If not, you need
a puller.  Be sure to use one that goes through the two square holes in
the hub, not one that pulls on the rim of the pulley.  I fabbed a
makeshift puller out of a thick piece of bar stock and some bolts.

If your new pulley doesn't slide right on, don't force it!  It might have
some sort of coating on the inner surface.  You might be able to force it
on, but the next person who tries to remove it will not have kind thoughts
about you.  Take some fine sandpaper and work the hole over until it
slides into place.  Put a thin film of anti-sieze on the surface and slide
it into place.  Torque the nut to 32 foot-pounds and you're in business.
