Subject: Re: [T2] re: claims for electric car

What happens when a vehicle packed with lithium ion
cells gets in a wreck? Something like a semi truck
rear-ending it at speed?  Or - better yet - a Seattle
Metro bus also running on lithium ion batteries?  I
have heard that some of the RC plane guys have had
lithium ions burn right through their cars and into
the asphalt below when they had a failure while
charging (usually off their car battery / in the car
engine compartment) One story was that it burned right
through the car's engine block. Any truth to those
stories, ya think? -BaH

&gt; No doubt some written or audio file on this coverage
&gt; is on the BBC 
&gt; website.
&gt; 	The BBC reporter claimed to have experienced 0 - 60
&gt; mph in 
&gt; 4.0 s (in accord with the firm's claims), but only
&gt; 130 mph.  The 
&gt; price is projected as $100,000.   Batteries are
&gt; stated to be 'lithium 
&gt; ion'.
