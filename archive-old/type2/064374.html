As I don't have the luxury of a MIG welder I'm forced to repair small
exhaust holes with a regular arc welder. Now, as I'm sure you're all aware,
arc welding the thin steel of a muffler usually just results in the small
hole you're trying to fill very quickly becoming a *large* hole.

So here's a tip: Unravel a wire coathanger (or get a piece of similar gauge
wire) and place it over the hole you want to fill, then strike the arc. The
arc will melt the wire, which will then fill the hole very nicely without
burning the thin steel of the muffler.
