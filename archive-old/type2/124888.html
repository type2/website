Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Tin

Isn't this pretty?
http://www.72camper_dot_com/tin_0857.jpg

That's the tin, etc. I painted for my old Spiffy bus. It was done in some
&quot;heavy duty&quot; paint I found at NAPA, after being sandblasted and
primered....however it didn't stay that pretty long. While changing the fuel
filter just a bit of gas would make the paint come right off. Oil wiped off
pretty good though. If you can keep the fuel off of it the paint should last
a while.

If you have the money powder coating is the way to go. I am hoping to do
that to the tin on Sunshine. I believe they can color match to just about
any color. If anyone else has input on powder coating I am interested!!
