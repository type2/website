Subject: Re: [T2] Dellorto carb experiences (long, technical)

I got my set of Dells while I lived in Italy. I took them off of an Alfa 
Romeo Sud (say sood - means South).

I bought a bunch of jets and such from CB and discovered that their 
recommended adjustments were too rich so I found a happy place somewhere 
between the Alfa settings and CB. The Alfa was too lean.

I was running 34mm venturis I think. A quick check when I get home will 
tell the tale if you like.

My recommendation would be to buy or build a air/fuel monitor and check 
your jetting.

I'm not sure what to say about your lower vacuum settings. Maybe the 
venturis are still too big and the vacuum signal is weaker and thus the 
fuel is not getting metered well.

I was running a stock 2.0 bus engine in my Beetle with an 050 distributor. 
Never had a bog or flat spot.

Have you tried a different distributor? Have you revved the engine with a 
timing light on it to be sure the timing is advancing smoothly?

What sort of fuel pressure? For my info - what type of fuel pump? (I had 
one of those noisy little helicopter pumps and won't use one again.)

&gt;History:  I've had these Dellorto DRLA 40 dual carbs on my bus for 
&gt;somewhere approaching 10k miles now.  When I got them, the jets (main and 
&gt;air-correction) were hogged out, way out.  Drove okay but mileage was 
&gt;unacceptably low and I was worried about the detrimental effects of 
&gt;running the engine so rich.
&gt;
&gt;Several months ago I obtained new jets.  These carbs have 34mm venturis 
&gt;and I installed the recommended (by CB Performance, arguably the authority 
&gt;on these carbs on a VW) 140 mains and 180 AC's.  Then I did some freeway 
&gt;mileage tests and found that I could get nearly 20mpg at a steady 
&gt;55mph.  That was good, but there was a new problem.  A flat spot off idle 
&gt;which felt very much like the dreaded 009 flat spot.  I checked that 
&gt;everything else was within spec and couldn't resolve the problem.  Next I 
&gt;called CB Performance back and they suggested that I increase my idle jet 
&gt;size.  I ordered 65 idle jets to replace the 60's that were in there but 
&gt;left them on a shelf until a couple of weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;After installing the new idle jets, I wish I had done it much sooner.  The 
&gt;flat spot was reduced to more of a slight bog and my around-town mileage 
&gt;went up 1-2mpg.  Now getting 16 consistently, which is about the best city 
&gt;mileage my bus has ever gotten.  I'm wondering if going up to 70 on the 
&gt;idle jets would be even better.
&gt;
&gt;I got to thinking about the flat spot and wondering why it was there.  I 
&gt;figured that it must be the emulsion tubes but CB performance verified 
&gt;that the ones I had were okay.  When I installed the Dellortos in place of 
&gt;the stock Solexes, I saw a big decrease in manifold vacuum.  At idle, the 
&gt;reading was similar to before but when you start opening the throttle with 
&gt;the Dellortos, the vacuum drops off quickly to zero whereas with the 
&gt;Solexes the curve was not as steep.  To give you an example, with the 
&gt;Solexes at 60mph on level ground I might see 7-8in, while with the 
&gt;Dellortos I see 2-3in.  This never worried me because I knew why it was 
&gt;happening.  Partly because of the much larger throttle plates and 
&gt;venturis, and maybe partly because vacuum comes from only a single 
&gt;cylinder vs. all four cylinders with the Solexes.  (The Dellortos are a 
&gt;single-cylinder-per-barrel design while the Solexes are two-cylinders-per 
&gt;barrel.  Two-cylinder-per-barrel designs have some design issues that 
&gt;necessitate plumbing the intake manifolds together, which is what allows 
&gt;you to draw vacuum from all four cylinders).
&gt;
&gt;This sharp dropoff of the vacuum curve is, I believe, at least partly 
&gt;responsible for the flat spot.  I don't know why it took me so long to 
&gt;realize it.  Because of the sharp dropoff of the vacuum, I am getting 
&gt;little or no vacuum advance at part throttle, which reduces the function 
&gt;of my distributor to that of (suprise suprise) an 009.
&gt;
&gt;I have a couple of questions that I really don't expect to get answers to, 
&gt;but here goes anyway:
&gt;
&gt;1)  Why haven't people with Dellorto DRLA carbs complained about this before?
&gt;
&gt;2)  What would happen if I plumbed all of my intake manifolds 
&gt;together?  (I'm half convinced I wouldn't see any more vacuum from doing 
&gt;this, but would it make the engine run worse?)
&gt;
&gt;I am thinking about going with smaller venturis (I can get 32's) and main 
&gt;jets along with possibly upping the idle jets another notch.  This will 
&gt;cost me around $80 for parts - an expensive experiment.  I should say that 
&gt;the bus drives pretty darned well right now.  Most people probably 
&gt;wouldn't even notice the slight bog.  I'm tempted to just leave it as is, 
&gt;but I'd like to find that last bit of driveability.  And for the 
&gt;anal-retentive stock-or-its-crap types, yes I know I'm basically in 
&gt;uncharted waters, and I can live with the consequences of my actions.  I 
&gt;do have a vague idea of what I'm doing so spare me your lectures - thanks.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;Any constructive comments are appreciated as always.
