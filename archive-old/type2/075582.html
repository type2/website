Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

John,

Shame on you&lt;grin&gt;....you of all should know better than to say &quot;test&quot; or
&quot;reference&quot; without the URL or personal data.

Where is the data for synthetics???
I *know* that you know your stuff, but share!

I use mobil 1 in F**d, but am afraid to use it in my bugs.  Every time
that I do, it seems to get sucked up faster than 1 qt/3,000 miles.

In my F**d I use 0 quarts/10,000 miles.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The synthetic oil &quot;truth&quot; is based on testing when? 197x? I assure you, oils
&gt; have made huge changes since then. OUR testing has shown 10-15 degree drops
&gt; in oil temps, with other engine temps staying the same or dropping, PROVIDED
&gt; you use one of a couple brands of oil.
&gt; 
&gt; The benefits of synthetics are not utilized if you don't have good
&gt; filtration, since to remove the dirt you have to change the oil ($$$$).
&gt; 
&gt; I really wish people would take a good HARD look at tests, and when they
&gt; were done, when repeating that &quot;information&quot; to everyone within earshot.
&gt; Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight weight oil, and
&gt; AM radios. Time marches on (and so does technology), don't get stuck in a
&gt; rut!
&gt; 
&gt; PS: There is some EXTENSIVE dyno testing taking place on certain cylinder
&gt; head chamber shapes, and deck heights, and compression ratios, on the
&gt; upright Type 1 engine, including oil and head temps, and output #s, that
&gt; will try to rid the VW World of a humongous Myth that's been circulating for
&gt; what seems like forever. Stay tuned. My lips are sealed, but you heard it
&gt; here first.
