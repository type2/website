Subject: Water cooled engine in your bus/what I saw at the Energy Fair
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

It looks like no one else on this list went to the
Renewable Energy Fair a week ago at Amherst, WI, or at
least they're not talking!

In the area displaying various types of vehicles,
including the Honda and Toyota hybrid
gasoline-electrics, some &quot;home-built&quot; hybrids and
all-electric cars, there was also an old diesel rabbit
that ran on vegetable oil (straight used veggie oil,
not the bio-diesel that you hear a lot about
recently), and of course a bio-diesel demonstration.
The display of interest to this group was a breadloaf
bus with a VW watercooled engine in it.  I mentioned
this bus last year, also, as it was at last year's
energy fair at Madison,WI. This conversion was done
with 100% VW parts (according to the owner).  I didn't
write down anything, and really didn't ask as many
questions as I wanted to, as he was quite busy every
time I managed to get to that end of the fairgrounds,
but I did get his card.  Here's the contact info:
Yascolt Stas, 422 West Kitchen Road, Pinconning, Mich.
 48650
Phone:  517-879-7330 (24 hours), 517-879-4504 (days
only).
He was using a front mounted radiator with a housing
from a Brazilian(?) watercooled bus, so his bus looks
like the ones you see in Mexico or South America. I
don't remember what he said the total cost for parts
is, but part of his selling point was that with
everything being VW parts, you should be able to get
service at any VW shop.
Sorry I didn't get more info, but I was really
spending my time looking at solar panels and wind
generators and talking to people.  Too much stuff to
see and learn in just 3 days.
