Subject: what happened to my Bus and a Friday thing...

Thanks to all who gave me feedback on my bus not running; it was that
the points were bad and when it backfired a bunch of hoses popped off.
$15.00 later all is well; the worst part of the whole ordeal was riding
in the towtruck with the AAA driver who once he figured out I was a
nurse, proceeded to tell me about every horrible medical thing that had
ever happned to him.  He also called me &quot;honey&quot; about 50 times.  Anyway-
as I was on the phone with AAA at work, on of my co-workers says, &quot;Don't
you think it's time you got a NEW car?&quot;.  And I said, &quot;NO!!!  I love my
bus. It is actually one of the more reliable cars I 've had.&quot;   But it
just ticked me off that people view my (or anyone's) bus as this
inferior piece of junk that I am only driving because I can't afford a
new econobox.  The truth is where ever I go, people say &quot;Nice bus&quot; or
smile and wave at me.  They would not be doing that or saying, &quot;Hey,
nice new whatever type of new car it is.&quot;  I have a bumper sticker on
the back of my bus that says &quot;You laugh because I'm different; I laugh
because you're all the same.&quot;  Happy Friday!  Beth and Prudence the 78
Bus
