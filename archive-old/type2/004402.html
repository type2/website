Subject: Re: [T2] engine rebuild

I only paid $125 for my 1700 411 engine and it ran as soon
&gt;as it was installed, BUT it was still an old engine and had a lot of
&gt;little problems.  I only used it for a spare while working on my main
&gt;engine and it lasted 5 years or so until I had to let it go because of
&gt;lack of space to store it.  (a list member got it from me when we cleaned
&gt;out the garage on Central Ave. Dave W, don't know what he did with it, I
&gt;think he was just going to use it for parts)

Tarped in the yard, Bob. Along with a number of other engines, transmissions,
doors and several tons of other late bus parts at zip code 14572. ( www.mapquest_dot_com ).
Requests welcome.
