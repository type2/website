Subject: Re: [T2] painting poptop?

&gt; &gt; i'm also thinking about painting the fiberglass top. i've seen a few
other
&gt; &gt; type IIs around town with a glossy finish on their tops, which looks
pretty
&gt; &gt; sharp. anybody know how to achieve this effect? can it be done by an
amateur
&gt; &gt; for cheap? are they just using new vanagon tops, or is the secret in the
&gt; &gt; paint?

When I painted mine I used some paint recommended from a hardware
for the poptop - but it had to be applied with a brush (though now I'd just
pour it in my compressor sprayer).  Anyhow, it was hard not to leave brush
marks.  So when I painted the luggage rack I just used normal white
(Krypton)
enamel spray paint.  It looks better (took a few coats) than the poptop and
hasn't pealed off or anything yet, though it might some day.  I don't know.
If I had to paint another poptop I'd just use the normal spray paint found
anywhere.  It works fine for me.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek
