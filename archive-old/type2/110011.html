Subject: Re: [T2] New Microbus

George--

And this &quot;Throttle by Wire&quot; caper is a big dollar object to repair--and
everyone is going there--

Take note of this---

There is no maintenance---nothing you can possibly do to prevent this
stuff from shutting itself down in Podunk Nebraska--when it feels like
it--

Case in Point--
Guy buys a brand new Mack Truck to the tune of $125,000.00--loaded to
the max---
Hooks himself up to his trailer---runs down the road and gets his
load--and is heading out west--now mind you this is all within 2 hours
time--and the Sears tower is still within his sight in his rear view
mirrors---

And the truck shuts itself off---dead---morto--finito---

Thank God for technology--he had a cellphone and calls Mack---

They drop the trailer along the interstate--and tow him to the shop--35
miles in the opposite direction--

What was wrong?

Nothing they could find--
A battery cable disconnect--to reset the engine management system---and
down the road he went---

I am not too fond of this kinda stuff--what happened to filing the
points with a matchbook emory--and gapping them with it doubled up--and
down the road you go???

No control is not a neat thing---
