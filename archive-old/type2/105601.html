Hi!
I just joined th list. I've been away from volkswagons
since the late 80's....but apparently like the british cars
they draw you back!  ;-)

...I accidently picked up a free '78 westy with the motor
inside all apart.......later found a good 2-litre engine to
install soon, and now I will be driving my own bus finally!
I will be looking for all the parts sources to restore the
poor thing, so any help would be great!

1) how difficult is it to repair tear/rot damage in the
canvas? (like many too poor to replace..)

2) what is the electric fan blower in top of engine
compartment? (remember engine was removed prior to my
acceptance of the van)it's not apparetly connected to
anything right now, but is a vw/audi part...

3)It had the hinged table, bit all hardware was removed for
replacement and lost? is it available? I have the wood, and
mount, but no hinges or the other parts

4) are there covers over the storage compartments in hte
fender wells under the seats?

5)anyone have a correct owners manual to spare for a decent
price? can't find on ebay (have a vanagon one to trade? 
;-)

6)what is suggested to rejuvinate the fiberglass top?
should it be re-gel-coated? it's kinda getting fuzzy

7)what sort of fuel economy should I expect?(anything will
be better than the 10 mpg i get in my Land-Rover)

8)any tricks/tips for the aux battery? it apparently had
one before, cables/wires taped off with elect tape, but
does it come with an isolator or is it just a second set of
wires from alternator?

etc....more later
