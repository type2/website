&gt;I am rebuilding a 2.0L 79' FI from my '79 nine passenger.  I am having
&gt;difficulty removing the fan and the fan shroud.  My manual (which covers
&gt;1972-1979 Type-2) says to &quot;remove three bolts in center of fan and work
&gt;the fan off the engine...&quot;
&gt;
&gt;It is not that easy... It seems that there is something else to this...
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have more specific instructions...?


Use a propane torch to warm the center of the fan. About 256.357 degrees F
will expand the fan. Shouldn't take more than a coupla minutes with the 
commom hardware store type torch. Keep the torch moving slowly around the
perimeter of the center hole, not in the hole.

If it doesn't yeild, tap it with a hammer, not enough
to dimple the aluminum. If that doesn't do it, we'll have to
contact Houston to beam us up more spezial instructions.
