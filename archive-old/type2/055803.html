Subject: Re: Learn from my mistakes....or the Diesel Splitty

All,
	Diesel fuel is not for gas engines, though...  My wife topped off the
'74 super beetle with diesel, 8 gallons worth and drove home.  She said
that it was stalling out at red lights!  She drove 4 miles, much further
than what gas is in the float bowl.  I noticed right away what had
happened and drained the beetle's tank.  The fuel didn't go to waste. 
Our '79 Peugeot 504 diesel did quite well with it last winter.
