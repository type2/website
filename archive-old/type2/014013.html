Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Eng. temp opinion requested

&gt;&gt;The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
&gt;&gt;designed for a 411&amp; 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, 
&gt;&gt;and both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
&gt;&gt;contaminants..

&gt;Hmmm... the last 914 I saw at the track, after a 20 minute session the 
&gt;temp gauge was pegged and the sweat falling from my face as I leaned 
&gt;over the engine compartment (Texas World Speedway, summertime) was 
&gt;vaporizing on contact with the engine case.  

Ah yes.  This brings back memories...  Memories about why the heck I moved from 
San Antonio, TX to Colorado Springs, CO in the first place!!  David's right.  
914's are more than capable of getting too hot too fast.  They're lighter, more 
aerodynamic, and geared a lot better, but they're in need of external oil 
coolers every bit as much as a bus.  Can't speak to the 411's since I've never 
had one.
