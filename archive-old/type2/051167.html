If you don't have power going to the coil it is probably a loose wire or
fuse in the ignition switch.  ECU and AFM have nothing to do with sending
the primary current to the coil.  Find a wiring diagram in the Bentley or
Haynes and start tracing current.  Sometimes fuses are faulty even if they
appear OK because the element becomes brittle and unreliable.  There are a
lot of wires under the dash of a 77 that can short out, blow fuses, and
cause problems.  Good luck.

I had a problem with my 77 Transporter FI, MT (electronic ignition - no
points) stopping suddenly. After troubleshooting several things that
turned out to be unrelated, I found that currently I have no power going
to my coil and I can't figure out why??? ECU?? AFM??  It seems like
there should be something that I can, relatively easily, check to
determine why I'm not getting juice to my coil but I can't manage to
figure it out. Any advice will once again be greatly appreciated.
