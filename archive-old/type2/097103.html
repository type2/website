Subject: Anyone live in Atlanta?

Anyone live in Atlanta and be willing to checkout a 67 Westy for me?  Take
some digital pictures?  I can't get down that way for a month or so.

The girl who owns it doesn't seen to know much about it.  Other than she's
owned it for 7 years and it has aftermarket bucket seats.  After my friend
spoke with her more it was determined it was Walkthrough.  The drivers door
doesn't open and it has a small dent in the back and no rear bumper.  The
biggy that kept him from getting it was the fact it has an aftermarket Sunroof
where the Westy top would be.

Dave
