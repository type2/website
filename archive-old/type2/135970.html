Subject: Pimp My Ride on M-TV

Hey guys,

   I don't normally watch MTV, but I do try to record all the car shows I can from various channels using TiVo. After watching the last one, I learned that they're going to be &quot;pimping&quot; a VW Bus this next episode. The next episode will air on Sunday. I only saw it for a split second, but they had the interior stripped. Usually they put on some crazy color, and some ridiculous wheels that I'd never be caught dead with, but it might be fun to watch anyhow.

So, MTV on Sunday. Check your local listings...
