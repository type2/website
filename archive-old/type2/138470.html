Subject: Tiny female connectors

Hey, ground wire are all over the place, and if you have a chance to cut off 
a connector, and strip the wire back a half inch to bare the wire so you can 
add on a new connector, you may be surprised to find a whole lot of green 
crud in the ends of the wire...

I broke a tiny female connector that goes from the wire harness to the right 
rear tail light.  I had to cut the broken connector off in order to attach a 
new tiny female connector.

Well, I had to cut so much wire off that even if I did attach a NEW tiny 
female connector, it would not be long enough to connect to the rear light. 
So I wanted to splice on a wire that already had the tiny female connector 
with it.

I found the perfect donor.  The tiny light bulbs in the dash all are 
connected via these tiny female connectors.  I just picked one section of 
wire &amp; tiny female connector from my wire stash and that was it.
