&gt; &gt;&gt; The '78 has
&gt;&gt; round exhaust ports while the '80 has more rectangular exhaust ports.
&gt; 
&gt; Also note that ' 78 had just EGR. Whereas ' 80 V-gon had EGR &amp;oxy. sensor. I 
&gt; would imagine you could drill a hole in the J-pipe just before the converter 
&gt; on your ' 78 exhaust and rig a oxy.sens. there. Depends if you need to get 
&gt; it smoged.
