  Dear Steve:
    I live in Va. Beach, Va. and have owned an all German 1980
  campingbus since buying it new in Bremen Dec. 1979. 
 
    The bus has just had an oil change, new battery &amp; wipers 
  a new Va. Inspection sticker, and it runs. 
    Can you send this info,. thru the grapevine, please? 
  I am ready to sell .  More particulars to any interested party.

     It has a fully equipped kitchen, 2 beds, pop-top, double glazed
  windows and an auxiliary heater for those cold nights in the Alps.
    Interior is clean. Body has some rust...Thanks ...Elise Simon
