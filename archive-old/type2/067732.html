Subject: F.S. '56-'60 bus middle seat (full length)

Hi, Everyone,   Clara (and she knows her splitty stuff !) has informed me that
the full length middle seat I have for sale (in addition to my mid '60's short
middle seat that I'm selling) is for a '56-'60 bus.
The seat is full length w/ fold down end.  It has aluminum grab bars on the
back. It was out of a '58 bus. 
The upholstry is of the light greyish color and has wide pleats. 
the upholstry isn't ripped, but the bottom front seam is split (just the threads
dry rotted, it can be re-stitched)

I'm in Allentown, Pa  (sorry west coasters.....it's a little to big for UPS!!)
