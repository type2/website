hey all

well it's still SORT OF friday, soooo...........

I went to pick a pack of cigs a couple minutes ago and saw an orange westy,
broke on the side of the road apparently (why else would somebody leave
their bus on the side of a country road, at 3 in the morning?). couldn't see
all that much tho cuz it was dark. This was at the intersection of old 86,
fayettville rd (i think), dairyland rd, and homestead rd in chapel hill, NC
(calvander). this is less than 1 mile from my house.

is this anybody on the list??  is it the guy that lives on old 86 just south
of I40 with an orange and a white westy?

i've also seen an orange bus (not westy, i think) driving on churton st in
hilsboro. list member?

give me a shout out if i spotted yer bus!
