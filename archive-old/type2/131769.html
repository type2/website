Subject: RE: '77 Manual tranny and engine into a '73 Bus

&gt;From: &quot;Will Anderson&quot; If you do a front to back change, you should be in 
&gt;good shape (as long as
&gt;they are both manual transmissions!)  check the front tranny mount
&gt;configuration though, I am still not sure about that, but I think they are
&gt;the same.


To the List:

The situation - 73 bus needs engine, tranny is on it's way out. So if all 
removed just a 73 bus.

Solution - 77 tranny and engine all parts in between included, even the 
starter.

Questions - Will I have to change out the nose cone on the newer tranny to 
make it mount properly or will it work as is? Are there any other problems I 
might need to address before trying to install this setup? Linkage, shifter 
rod, etc.

Any takers that would like to share their knowledge or experience (Mr. 
Dearing)?
