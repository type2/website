Subject: Speeding ticket in 75 bus........South Caroninian advice
  sought..

(Note, advice replies are requested off list, as I don't want to clog it 
up  with comments on how to beat a ticket)-but posting your experiences 
with the law while in your bus should be ok......)
      AArrgh, on her way to Everybus from Savannah my college junior 
daughter got caught in a speed trap just before getting onto Rt 95 going 
up Rt 17  from Georgia.  In 7 years of driving her bus this never 
happened to her,
for I know she does the speed limit or at most 5 mph above it.......Rt 
17 goes past a wildlife area (55 mph) and I think the Hardeeville
city limit (town is north of 95) starts just before the onramp, as she 
was literally  stopped on the onramp.  The officer (Badge 511, a woman), 
issued her a
ticket for 20 mph over the limit, apparently not liking the &quot;hippi-van&quot;
as most kind cops would give a ticket for 19mph over the limit to avoid 
the full 4 points.  I'm sure Nyssa could argue her odometer is not the 
best and I think is off at 60 mph. She is insured through the family 
policy.  The court date is May 21 at 36 Main Street, Hardeeville, likely 
a municipal jurisdiction within Jasper County.
    Advice I got at Everybus ranged from &quot;Get a lawyer&quot;, argue it to a
lesser &quot;equipment failure&quot; citation, but she won't lie that odometer was 
not working, ask for &quot;probationary judgement&quot;
(points knocked off if you get no tickets in say, a yr, but it's 5 years
in SC!), or offer to take a safe driving course to knock off at least 2
points (4 will definitly raise insurance, which can go over $1000 extra) 
- or just pay the $180 fine and admit you did not
see the sign for the speed drop (she had 3 friends with her).
Any experience the collective group has had with traffic court would be
appreciated- please reply privately ( replyto:benthin_at_prodigy_dot_net )
unless you want to comment on experiences you had with your bus- I do
recall that in 1974 I got a ticket going down a hill on Rt 81 12 mi over
the limit just so I could crawl over the next hill without dropping to
25 mph!  My argument: &quot;Well, my average speed is under the limit!&quot; did
not fly with the officer.......
