Subject: Re: [T2] Loose Shifter



Hey ya Travis,


&gt;&gt;Is it normal for my shifter to have a lot of free play while in gear?

I don't think a little play is a big deal but when knuckles start hitting 
the E-Brake like mine did, I did do something about it!

I have read stuff here over time about the &quot;shift coupler&quot;
&gt;and associated &quot;bushings&quot; down there (I'm working from memory here, so
&gt;please forgive me if my terminology is incorrect) - would these be likely 
&gt;culprits, or is what I'm experiencing sound normal?

Terminology sounds spot on ;&gt;)  And yes it was the Shift Coupler that was my 
culprit.  I crawled up under her where it connects to the trans and man was 
it mangled (must have bounced off a few roots or stumps).
I have a '71 and I did go ahead and do the bushings but that means taking 
the engine and trans completely out where to do the &quot;shift coupler&quot; edging 
those back an inch or so is all that has to be done.
