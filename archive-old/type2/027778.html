Hey Volks,

I hate to say it, but I'm letting go of my bus.  It's in good shape and has 
145,000 miles with only 3,000 miles on the rebuild.  Recently replaced the 
clutch and fuel injectors.  Should be ready for many more miles of Muir 
style fun.  I just don't have the ambition to work on it anymore living here 
in North Dakota.  $4000, or best offer.  I just want it to have a new good 
home.
