well, after about 4 months off im back... been quite an adventure. pulled the 
engine.. repainted everythign cleaned it up, put everything back in all for 
the first time ever with only the help of the bently. rebuilt bolth carbs... 
and at first it ran fine.. but the right one was leaking gas, so it took it 
into a shop (the carb not the bus), finaly i found a place i trust. only 
about 15 miles away too... Anyway, ive been haveing problems getting it 
started now, the only way i can keep it going is by pumping the gas petel... 
starts fine ect ect.. just wont run at all, unless i pump the petel..... any 
ideas...
