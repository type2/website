The key phrase here is &quot;from the factory.&quot;  Apparently the factory did the
engineering needed to integrate the siping into the basic design of the
tire.

This is a long way from having Bobo the Tire Guy slice a set of tires that
were not designed for it!

I'm not saying that siping a tire won't aid traction on ice and snow, but
there has to be a downside in wear or dry traction.  I used to do a lot
of artistic things with razor blades to motorcycle tires when I raced,
but with the sure knowledge that the tires would wear rather rapidly.  I
certainly wouldn't want to use a sliced tire on dry pavement, as the same
flexibility that aids traction on loose surfaces will ruin it on dry
pavement.
