Subject: errata page for Muir

My bus is back home after surgery, I plan to do much on it myself and
reading Muir last night to get in the mood recall many people saying bits of
it were off the mark in some way. Can we get all the parts of this great
book that are in doubt listed in the archive or somewhere we can access it
all, maybe print them out and shove them inside the back cover??
