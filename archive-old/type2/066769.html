I would definately take a couplea weeks and drive down thru GA
and stop in all the small towns, then maybe drive on to
the Georgia Coast, (Savannah, Tybee Island, Jekyll, etc..) Maybe camp near the beach, enjoy the silence since it's positively
OFF season right now.  Then maybe drive across central Alabama,enjoy the fall colors, then go up the Mississippi River Road
a ways, visit family.  Drive back thru Kentucky, dodging pot
holes on the Purchase Parkway, but otherwise having a grand
old time.  Fool around on the Cumberland Plateau for a few daysand maybe hike a bit, finally return to the homeplace in
South Knoxvegas (Knoxville to non-E.Tennesseeans).  Ahhh. Maybe
next year.
