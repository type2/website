Subject: Canada, eh?

I'm up here in Montana at Malmstrom AFB.   
I'm half Canadian and tried for 12 yrs to get this assignment so I could 
visit friends and relatives more than once a year.  Here's my personal 
list of do's and don'ts: 
- Dog, carry current rabies certificate, a dog tag won't cut it. It must 
be signed by the VET.
-  Carry valid, current ID, registration, insurance and a birth cert on 
the kid.  I'm a single parent and even have to show my divource to prove 
I'm not kidnapping the boys!
-  Have as much cash on hand as you think you'll need. I usually only 
have about $40 bucks and tell them I have my ATM and VISA (or whatever 
card).  I always use the ATM to get my Canadian money, you get the 
current exchange rate that way.  You usually lose a few cents on the 
dollar if you do it at home before you leave.  Also the larger tourist 
traps/Motels etc will often offer a higher exchange on US dollars if you 
patronize their business.  
-  Tell the Immigration/Customs guy of a specific place or places you're 
going rather than just &quot;touring the free places to camp.&quot;  No sense 
complicating their thought processes wondering where you're going, what 
you're gonna do there and how you're gonna pay for it.  
-  No huge hunting knives, guns, mace, pepper spray, fruit, and only 
small amounts of alcohol (like a case of beer) for personal use
-  Just be respectful and don't joke and you'll get accross fine, 
sometimes you get inspected just because they're doing every tenth car 
or whatever, smile and cooperate and they'll be cool.
Have fun,
enjoy Canada
