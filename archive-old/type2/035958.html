Well Doyt, I doubt
that the problem within the heart 
of your bus
was shared by mine.

Up in my soul,
I do believe,
Your problem lies in the stem
of the electrical
tree.

That as it may be,
this silly voice
is slowing me down
and I must get going.
&lt;/end jesse jackson voice&gt;

When I said AFethM, I was referring to the AFM, or Air flow meter, also
know as *Mass* Air Flow Meter. There's a 6- or 7-pin plug that plugs into
the side of it. That's what I unplugged and in two seperate occassions, the
bus would continue running (though only idling--you won't go visit grandma
like that) with the AFM unplugged. In each of these instances, replacement
of the double relay solved the problem.

Now, that said, if you've replaced your double relay already and if the AFM
trick makes your bus run for more than 8 seconds...and even if it doesn't,
look to the wire that runs from the double relay back to the coil. I
believe that helps enable a switch inside the double relay that sends power
to the fuel pump after the cold start valve shuts off. In the first 8
seconds though, the fuel pump gets its power indirectly from the computer,
which sends a signal at the behest of the thermo time switch, which is the
switch that turns on the cold start valve. Get it? Not me. This is totally
confusing, except that I *think* I understand it, which is the frightening
part.

This is all critical to your understanding of FI and diagnosing your
problem, so I'll put it another way as well:

The thermo time switch (TTS) is switched ON when it is cold--just like
nipples on the other kind of tt's get switched on when it is cold--Cold
TTS=ON--[sorry volks, but now you'll never forget this]. When you apply
power (key on) to the thermo time switch, it's internal clock (actually a
thin bi-metallic strip) starts ticking (actually contracting or expanding;
I don't remember which). When enough time has elapsed (between 7-13 or so
seconds), the thermo time switch becomes switched OFF.

As long as the TTS is ON, the fuel pump operates in a by-pass mode. The
engine needs time to try to start and prepare other conditions for running.
By-pass mode ceases when the TTS goed OFF. What is bypassed, *I think*, is
the signal from the brain that tells the double relay that the engine is
running.

Now the fuel pump is always operated by the double relay...don't get me
wrong. It's just that there are different switches inside the double relay
that operate the fuel pump based on different conditions. So in bypass
mode, the double relay sends the signal to run the fuel pump because the
brain (ECU) tells one switch to turn on...because word on the street is
that the TTS are pointy (er, I mean, the TTS is ON).

As soon as the TTS goes OFF, the fuel pump stops. UNLESS it is getting a
signal from somewhere else. That somewhere else would be a *different*
switch inside the double relay. Now the double relay is dumb as a doornail.
But it follows instructions. The brain (ECU) tells the double relay when to
open the main gate supplying power to the fuel pump...and when to close it
(key off). The power is always on the double relay, but it is only directed
from there to the fuel pump when the brain says &quot;Switch ON&quot;.

So you see, *I think* your problem is with the switch between the double
relay and the fuel pump...because the 8-second clock has everything to do
with that signal. In my case, everybody was talking to the double relay,
but he was beyond dumb. He was now seriously impaired and unable to fulfill
his duties (I think he overdosed on shorted electricity).

Doyt, I'm going to post this to the list in the hopes that someone smarter
than me will check my logic. I'm a hobbiest; not a mechanic...and
electricals take great energy for me to understand (pun intended).

BTW, I'm an instructional designer by trade (multimedia. Authorware.
Director. whatever). I've been searching for a project that really needed a
multimedia intervention that I could put on my website (volks_dot_net)--yes, a
solution in search of a problem. I really think that an
overview/explanation of bay window FI is the problem. Too many of us are
electrical idiots. I'd love to hear back from the list whether others agree.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;&quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, if your bus dieth after 8 seconds, but
&gt;idleth when you unplugeth the AFethM, the double relay has forsaken you and
&gt;you must toss it to the dungheap.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.
&gt;In the above context, please reveal to me the details of unplugging the 
&gt;&quot;AFethM.&quot;      My 76 bus runs 8 seconds and backfires and dost dieth.   It 
&gt;will do this over and over, but won't run more than 8 seconds. I have never 
&gt;been able to get it to idle after the engine rebuild last century (1999). 
&gt;It won't run more than 8 seconds.   That is not long enough to satisfy my 
&gt;needs for traveling.
&gt;
&gt;I have replaced the double relay and ritualistically pitched the old one.
&gt;
&gt;The bus still displays the 8 second run-backfire-stop pattern.    I suffer.
&gt;
&gt;Joe, please take pity on my poor soul and reveal to me what the  mystery of 
&gt;the &quot;AFethM&quot;  using different words that might allow me to find this thing 
&gt;that must be unplugged.   It sounds like something I need to do.      I 
&gt;want to unplug it.    This may be my only hope of ever driving my bus again.
&gt;
&gt;I have already replaced the double relay. So I worry about that. But 
&gt;getting the bus to idle at all beyond 8 seconds would be a gigantic step 
&gt;forward.
