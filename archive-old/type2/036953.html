Hi all,

I'm back from my trip to Seattle and just wanted to give a big thumbs up to
BOWWOW VW Parts in Seattle for the great assistance they gave me with the
stuff I needed. Good assortment of parts at one of  2 stores in the area and
very knowledgeable in general. They were even willing to help me locate used
parts if I wanted. Prices seemed reasonable -Although compared to over here
in Sweden everything was on sale anyway...

For the curious, I got a Pertronix ignitor set, valve cover gaskets, and new
engine seal for the bus and a new TMI rug set and Scat shifter for the
beetle. So much to buy, so little cash.....They also loaded me up with
&quot;Bowow&quot; stickers and other freebees :-)

Anyway, thanks again to the listees who helped me out with with Seattle
parts store info.

Regards,

John B.
