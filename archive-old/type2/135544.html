Subject: Re: [T2] High-lift jack?

&lt;&lt; So, here goes: how is a jack to lift the rear end of the Bus useful in
dropping an engine?

When removing/reinstalling the engine in my '71, &gt;&gt;

'71's have the removable apron that later Busses
don't have so, despite the type 4 engine's slightly
lower overall height, having the entire Bus higher
allows the engine to drop low enough to pull it out
under the apron...
