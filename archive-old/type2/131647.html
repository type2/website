&gt;Hello Michael      You are probably going to change the front nosecone and
&gt;shift rod.   If I remember right the front mounts are different and the 
&gt;shift
&gt;rod also but they are interchangable so that isn't a problem   Check the
&gt;brackets inside the nosecone  they are famous about breaking   the later 
&gt;ones have a
&gt;better designed shift linkage,   and you should be able to use it .
&gt;Everything else is a straight swap    If you want it right you should do 
&gt;the seals
&gt;while it is out and inspect the clutch

Thanks Mark,

By changing the nose cone and the shift rod, would this allow for the 
correct geometry of the shifter to linkage? Looks like the front shift rod 
is the difference here(I copied these from the Bus Boys Online catalog):

G.  211-711-155GU  Front Shift Rod, Used, 1973 (Chassis #213 2000 001 to 213 
2300 000)  CALL

G.  211-711-155FU  Front Shift Rod, Used, 1974 to 1975 (Chassis #214 2000 
001 to 215 2300 000)  CALL

G.  211-711-155HU  Front Shift Rod, Used, 1976 to 1979 (From Chassis #216 
2000 001)  CALL


The rear shift rod has me puzzled:

K.  211-711-171DU  Rear Shift Rod, Used, 1968 to 1972 (To Chassis #212 2300 
000)  CALL

K.  211-711-171LU  Rear Shift Rod, Used, 1963 to 1979 (From Chassis #213 
2000 001)  CALL

Maybe that 1963 in the later one is supposed to be 1973. I gues I could find 
some pics of the nose cone on the internet as well and see the difference in 
the linkage. I am wondering if the nose cone is different along with the 
linkage, but the location and operational movement of the linkage is the 
same, disreguarding the difference in the shift rods. Does that make sense 
to anyone?

Thanks again Mark.
