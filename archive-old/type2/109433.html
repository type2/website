Subject: Re: [T2] Part number match/ compatabilty

That's what I was concerned about. I dont know if the fuel pressure is
different on these two engines. Since the vacuum line runs directly to the
fuel pressure reg. I thought it might cause some difference in the air/fuel
ratio. Guess I'll find out.

&gt; The difference is that you have a part matched for a 1.8L engine and are
&gt; putting it on a 2L engine. The difference many be unperceivable.
