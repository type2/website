Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Corvair spark plug seals

&gt; &gt;Hi List,
&gt;         I have read that Corvair spark-plug air-seals are &quot;better&quot; than
&gt; &gt;original VW style ones.  Where does one go about purchasing them?  Part
&gt; &gt;numbers? Terminology (what is the Chev* name for them)? I have looked on
&gt; &gt;various Corvair pages but have not been able to find any mention of
&gt;them,
&gt; &gt;let alone pictures/numbers.  Thanks . jon

Hmmm - strangely enough the same thread is active on the Corvair list right 
now...

Must be more than just me reading both lists. Both are WONDERFUL resources.
