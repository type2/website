&gt; What type of refrigerant is used.


I'm sure it's R12. No Vanagon (of any year) came equipped with an a/c system
that used anything else, since alternative refrigrants did not even become
popular until long after the Vanagon went out of production.  However, your
local VW dealer service dept. or a good a/c specialist could tell you if the
stock a/c in an 82 Westy can be converted to the new refrigerant. (Most VW
a/c systems can be.)  If so it's just a matter of using different o-rings
and replacing the oil in the compressor (both of which should be easy to do
when installing the unit).
