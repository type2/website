Subject: Stock exhaust installation

I want to replace my aftermarket header exhaust system
with the stock setup.  The entire stock setup is available at
Bus Depot for $99.  
How hard is the installation process?
Will I need any special tools? 
Anyone out there used the Bus Depot system?
Is it really complete?
Will the stock system be quiet (the current header setup
is a total racket)?

Thanks for any input,
Brad Baker
