X-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Re: Rocky Mountian Motorworks catalogues

McFly: RMMW was bordering on bankruptcy, and had a MASSIVE shakeup.

If anyone didn't know, they used to send out 7 catalogs per year. this is
VERY EXPENSIVE, and have obviously reduced this waste to something
reasonable. I haven't gotten one in forever, who knows if they'll climb out
of their financial hole, but at least this is a good start.
