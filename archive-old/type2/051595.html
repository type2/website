Christopher and Kellie sends:

&gt; &quot;I wonder if I could hookup a power inverter to this plug in thing and
&gt; connect that to a second battery?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something pretty obvious that would make this not work?
&gt; If I am not, but it would require a little research and effort, I am all for
&gt; it. Maybe I could somehow hook up a switch to toggle if I wanted to get
&gt; power from the inverter versus the hookup, if I happen to be parked near a
&gt; wall outlet. (hehe)

You mean like buying a nice big UPS, removing the battery from it, and using
the input power to charge the battery? It should work fine; people have done
it and it works for them.

Removing the buzzer so you won't have to listen to it all the time would be
a good idea.
