Dave,

Congratulations!  Good job!

For the hydraulic lifters... If it has been more than a week since the
engine last ran, I would say just take it out and drive it around for a
while, locally, on surface streets, at low speeds, for like 1/2 hour.  If
you have any that have not pumped up after that amount of time, they are
dead and should be replaced.  My theory on this is that a collapsed lifter
is allowing way too much clearance and too much clearance does not damage
an engine (in 1/2 hour) despite how it sounds.  It is too *little*
clearance that will damage an engine. (I await the various flames I will
soon be receiving :-)

On the too rich problem when you start it, again, let it warm up.  My '80
stinks of gas when cold, but is just fine once it warms up.  I think this
is &quot;normal&quot;, tho I don't like it much.

                           Steve Dolan
