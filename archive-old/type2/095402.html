Subject: Re: [T2] clutch alignment

The tool you need costs less than $2.00 -- I've got an Empi blue plastic 
clutch alignment tool that set me back a whopping $1.59 at my local ACVW 
shop. I've seen them on VW parts/tools sites for about $2.00.

If you don't get everything lined up just right, you're going to have a hell 
of a time getting the motor back in and you could also damage the hub on the 
clutch and/or the input shaft splines.

If you can't get/find the tool, I've heard of people using a wooden broom 
handle.

Later...

&gt;Is it safe to align the clutch by eye on a 74 1.8. I
&gt;don't own the tool and can't really afford to buy it.
&gt;TIA
