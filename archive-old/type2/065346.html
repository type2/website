'79 has Vanagon engine with square exhaust ports, much more expensive
exhaust and possibly cat in all states if I recall correctly.

The assumption is correct, 78 is the box stock best year for campers
the only negative being the pitiful smaller side fridge, which does
admittedly give a nice floor layout.  71 may be better taking into
account that building a more powerful bug engine is far cheaper than
probably even building a stock T4 but as they came from the factory
T4 is superior.  Hydraulic lifters make the '78 desireable and A/C
is often available though pitiful.  All in all I'll give it thumbs
up as the best air cooled westy PERIOD funvtionally and driveably.
