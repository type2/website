Subject: strange thing by my front wheel

can anyone enlighten me? in trying to do the bearings and brakes on the
left front wheel of my 70 westy, i discovered a strange object mounted to
the wheel well. it is cylidrical, about 2&quot; around, give or take, and has
a connector on top... there is about a 1&quot; hose coming out either side of
this connector with brackets holding them firmy to the body 4-6&quot; on
either side of said connector... but as these hoses run to the bottom of
the bus to go to the back and up/under the dash (respectively), they have
been cut off...

when we were putting the engine in, i noticed a hose sticking out the
fire wall to the driver's side of the engine... i asked pete and he said
it looked like an A/C hose... said hose also comes out under the dash,
with a connector on the end that someone told me looked like an A/C
connector... now pete said the thing in the wheel well looks like it
could be a ... uh... damn, dont remember what he said now... but it was
something else having to do with an A/C unit... like condensor or
dehumidifier or some odd thing...

does anyone know for sure what this thing is and what else i need to make
the A/C work (including the parts that mount to the engine)... at this
point, i have hoses and this odd thing, if it is even an A/C part, and i
am not even sure it still works!

thanks for your wealth of knowledge,
chris
