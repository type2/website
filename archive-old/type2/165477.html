I wasn't betting on it.  I'm sure that that article has them in
bankruptcy right now.  I'll just run the tires and keep an eye on them.
The tire models that were recalled were the really wide ones that
typically are installed on big SUVs and pickups.  The model I'm running
wasn't mentioned in any articles I read.
