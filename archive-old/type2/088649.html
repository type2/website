I almost belong on the old-timers list. All I know is the uprights. I don't
think I would be up for a Vanagon.. (another reason why).. Jan B

&gt;
&gt; &gt; How much do fuel pumps cost to replace? I thought that they should be
&gt; &gt; replaced about every four years anyway. The diaphragms fail in time,
with
&gt; &gt; potentially dire results.
&gt;
&gt; Nope.  The person who posted this originally has an '80 Vanagon.  An '80
&gt; Vanagon has fuel injection with a high-pressure electric roller-cell fuel
&gt; pump.
&gt; There is no diaphragm inside and they most certainly should not be
replaced
&gt; every four years, since they cost about $200 and typically last 20 years
or
&gt; more.
