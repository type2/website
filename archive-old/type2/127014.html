Subject: Re: [T2] 72 VAN FAN HOUSING REMOVAL

yes. Check the Bentley on removing the alternator for how. You need to
remove a few pieces of the engine tin so it is isolated. In the lower
left corner there is a flat headed looong bolt that holds the ALT in
place. This also holds that housing on. The nut is hard to get to
(especially for re-attachment), but you can do it. One thing I noticed
when I swapped my ALT not too long ago, when re-installing, loosen or
remove the cooling tin on the bottom right side, and accessing the nut
under the ALT (connecting to the looong bolt) is much easier, and you
won't cut your hand up.
Good luck,

&gt; Howdy y'all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 72 van with an 1800 engine.
&gt; Just wondering if it is possible to remove the fan housing
&gt; (big metal piece that the fan and alternator are attached to)
&gt; without removing the engine.
