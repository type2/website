Subject: Re: [T2] Different Seats ==&gt; seatbelts

Now for a boring public safety announcement: When considering new seats,
also consider how you may need to adjust your seatbelts so they still fit
and work right. When I switched from the stock belts to the modern style I
spent half an hour adjusting them.  I don't use my belts ALL the time, but
when I feel the need, I expect to feel confident they'll do the job
properly, on BOTH sides.

Any long drawn out complaints about particular experiences buying new seats
or seatbelts can be directed that brick wall over there.
