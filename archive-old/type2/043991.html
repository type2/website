Subject: RE: [T2] read this before responding to my last message......

&gt; so, obviously it's the brake booster/servo thingy.  can i find a
&gt; used one?  how much?  does the master cylinder come out with it?
&gt; what would the part number be for the servo, for a 1978 standard bus, fi,
&gt; mine's too rusted to see the numbers...


We use 211 612 103AX.  This is probably the same as the original number (or
the most recent superceded VW number), except that the X on the end denotes
rebuilt. Our price (for a rebuilt unit) is $169.95 plus $25 core deposit,
although availability can vary since we have only one supplier who still
offers it.
