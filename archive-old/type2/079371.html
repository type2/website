Yow!  You have first hand experience with why I _never_ drive my bus after
dark where there is open range or large wildlife about.  Those stealth
cows and deer are just quick enough to get in front of you but not quick
enough to outrun you.

I had a mule deer enounter last summer at about 45MPH in a C*evy van and
that was bad enough for me.  After dark motoring in Mexico is only for
those with a direct line to a diety!  :)
