I'm a big fan of 3M Super Weatherstrip adhesive.  They also make a sprayon
adhesive for such things, but I don't have the can in my hand so I can't tell
you its precise name.   Check in the glue aisle at your local FLAPS.

&gt; Dear list:
&gt;
&gt; I need to reattach the peeling rubber that has detached from the seat
&gt; platforms.  This is the vertical area on the inboard side of the seats, in
&gt; the walkthrough area.  What is the right kind of adhesive to use here?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
