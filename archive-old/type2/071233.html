Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Heater for $100
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I would avoid doing business with this person if at all possible. I ordered a 
thing wiper motor from her and when it got here it was from some other type 
of car, no way was it going to fit. I called her and she said she had just 
pulled it from a thing. I had to call the thing shop on my dime(nice folks, 
real helpful) and get them to give me the part number for a thing wiper 
motor. I email her back with the info and she replied no problem, I have a 
few things out back, I'll pull another. Some time goes by with no word and no 
wiper motor. I had to send instant messages to her to get her to reply to me, 
but she suddenly didn't have any thing wiper motors out back anymore, she 
offered to get me one If only I would send more money. yea right. We made an 
agreement to have her refund the price of the motor including shipping since 
she had made the &quot;error&quot;. It took me a long time and alot of emails and 
instant messages(of course the money was always &quot;in the mail&quot;) to get any 
money out of her and when I did, she had not refunded the shipping, which she 
charged me almost $14 for, even though the actual cost was closer to $7. I 
have returened the motor as requested and sent many emails asking for the 
money she agreed I should get, but no answer and no check. 

&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever bought a BN4 heater from Cassandra at Coyfishat_at_aol_dot_com?
 They are selling heaters for $100, just need to know if anyone has had any
 experiences with this person?
