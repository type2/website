 &gt; hahy,  Id love the 77(on?) westy interior,  yet I can only come n

&gt; for such interior if cheeeaply , very, vary, cheaply priced. let me
&gt; know if youve got xtra or something. I appreciate it :)thanx !!! :)


Not sure how cheap you mean, but I have a '76-79 Westy interior (sofabed,
sink cabinet, icebox cabinet) that I'd sell for $275 complete.  Have another
in very good condition with stove and propane tank that I'd price at about
$450.  I'm near Philadelphia.
