Bob, I have seen this set up here in Doo Dah (Wichita....... Kansas?... 
yes Kansas)  The camper  is an orange(mango, pumpkin whatever) bus 
parked at what looks like a hippie flophouse. It's been sitting for 
several years, looks to be a mid to late seventies bus(i.e. taillights 
and bumpers look right) The slider door is sitting inside the bus and 
the drivers side is bashed in considerably (it used to not be that way 
looks like intentional abuse) The top is usually popped and doesn't 
appear to be to terribly rotted. ANYWAYS I've seen a critter like you've 
described.
                                    Steve
