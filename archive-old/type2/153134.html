Subject: cam timing question

not that any of you are home this holiday weekend to answer this :)

when i first built ALcrapcase Mk3, i did the 
dummy-lifters-pushing-a-dial-indicator thang, and found that when all 
was said and done my cam was retarded 4 degrees from grinder's spec. 
no big deal - more torque that way, which is what i was after anyways.

so now that the motor has been torn down and is ready for a 
rebuilding, will i get the same readings. or are they likely to have 
changed... and for what reasons?

if i don't HAVE to redo the cam checking procedure again, i'd rather 
not. on the other hand, if the timing  could go to X degrees 
advanced, i'd need to know.

i DO have a berg offset timing gear key if necessary to go that route.........
