Subject: 84 camperized vanagon, roof rack and westy cabinets (in WV)

Things are slow at work and it's definitely time
to lose a car or two.  I'm planning to put this
vanagon in the local papers this weekend.  I want
it to go to another loving volksaholic, but... 

Pics and location in signature.  

This is a good bus, with heat!  Suspension nice
and tight, no slop.  Body solid, with some of the
usual seam rust but nothing needing a patch.  Lt
blue over dark blue with blue interior.  Tranny
strong, no noises or difficulty shifting.  Has
the hot oil flicker at idle described as normal
by the owenrs manual.  Pressure checked out good.
 You can have it rechecked if you want.  Engine
no problems and heads are NOT leaking.  160k
miles.  

Recent NEW (not new-to-me/used) parts:  
brakes, 
hoses, 
radiator
gas tank
exhaust complete (except cat), 
battery, alternator, 
FI sensors, 
idle stabilizer, 
complete tuneup, 
proper D load-rated tires.

The only thing I know it needs is the front fan,
and sliding door handle.  I would be suspicious
of CV's and maybe a waterpump needing repair in
the future.  

This van was my daily driver in the recent past. 
That huge sunroof is loads of fun.  The rear
westy wolfy weekender bed and cushion are
queensized and comfortable.  Great for camping if
you cook outside (like I do) and don't have kids
(like I do).  

Asking $1900

ALSO FOR SALE:  
1/4 roof rack, chrome w/ wood slats for the
vanagon;
westy cabinets out of my 74 currently in the
vanagon but not installed yet; and 
vanagon curtains and screens out of wolfy
weekender
(I expect to be at Everybus and could bring parts
to you there.)
