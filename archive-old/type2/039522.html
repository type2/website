Subject: Stock A.C. for you.

Hey.  The old man says get rid of the air conditioning parts I stripped
from the bus.  I don't know if anything works, but it all looks good.
Everything's there (except the rubber hoses and belt).  Make me an
offer, or come and get it.  I don't really want anything for it, but i'd
rather not have to package it up for the mail, so that's where the cost
comes in.  Trades are of course welcome.

    Please please please have it, because it'll just get thrown out.
All parts from 77 westy.

Thanks.
