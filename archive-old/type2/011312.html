Subject: propane bottles

Pat Callaghan was looking for propane suggestions.
If cost is the main drawback of the small bottles.....adaptors are available 
to fill small bottles from regular [5 gal, etc] tanks, tho the small ones 
usually say 'not refillable', i've a friend been doing this for years. 
reckon he'd be happy to share his experience, if your interested, contact me 
direct and i'll give you his phone #.

best wishes
