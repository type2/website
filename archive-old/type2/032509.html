Subject: VW-DROP OFF IN POWER WHEN GOING UP HILLS

When I road tested our bus (prior to buying it) it had this problem, it   
would go up hills of any incline but only in second or first and then   
only slowly.

The bus has been undergoing major rebuild over the last year and one of   
the first things I found was the throttle linkage, which is pretty   
complex had so much wear in the system that the throttle was only able to   
open to about a quarter of full, ok for the flat but the slightest bit of   
a hill and it would immediately demand a lower gear.

I have completely rebuilt the system with new parts, most of which I had   
to make myself and now there is full range of movement plus enough to   
allow for future adjustment (I used to service aircraft throttle   
systems!!).
I cannot guarantee that this was the cause cos the bus is still on sticks   
at present but it is a very likely candidate!

Give it a try and see how much wear there is in the system (disconnect   
the acceleration pump first or you'll fill the engine with fuel).
