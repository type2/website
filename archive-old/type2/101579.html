Subject: Re: [T2] R,3,4 shifter situation solved!

&gt;Sounds like &lt;http://www.imcparts_dot_com/&gt;.  Some of my Bus &gt;Depot orders have been drop shipped from there.

I'll buy that.

Wherever it came from folks, let me tell you, my bus now shifts like it came off the showroom floor.

Neutral is now right in the middle, with tension in either direction, no slop in the gears, and my shift pattern is now measurable in inches rather than feet.

If your shifting is crap, and its not the adjustment plate, nor the shift coupler, get inside the nosecone on your tranny and replace the &quot;transmission hockey stick bushing&quot;.

Mine was completely gone, now floating in my gear oil, so I had a new one put in, and the shift coupler to boot.

What a world of difference.

Now to do battle with the recently list-famous california air resources board....

So these bus repairs don't end?

Billy
