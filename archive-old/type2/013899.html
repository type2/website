Subject: excessive oil leakage

Hi all, my 72 westy seems to have been dribbling more 
than its fair share over the past few months. For the 
past two days I have had it parked on the street in 
front of my house (tilted a little to the right). There 
is already a 3 inch oil spot under the right hand side.
About 4,000 miles age i replaced the right hand cylinder 
head. Should I maybe whip out my torque wrench and give 
the nuts some attention? Should i have already been 
doing so to both sides all along?
