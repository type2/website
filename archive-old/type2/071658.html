Just couldn't contain myself, had to post my little victory today.

First,  thanks to all the listmembers who helped me, consciously or not. 

Got my '68 running today after about 3 months.  I pulled the engine (my first)
and did some maint, including:

replaced oil cooler/seals 
replaced/sandblasted/repainted engine tin/rims
new engine seals
new plugs/wires/coil/points
sandblasted and repainted intake manifold (SP)
new muffler/heat exchangers/replaces missing studs
removed/cleaned/painted fuel tank (new screen/fuel lines)
got firewall to install (mine is an early '68, didn't have one)
cleaned engine after oil cooler leak (what a mess!)
new clutch/pressure plate/throwout bearing
changed transmission oil
new accelerator/clutch cables
new belt
reinstalled missing pre-heat tube
new windshield wiper arms/pivots (thanks aagain, PJ)
installed Hoover fuel line fitting in front tin (really easy, makes lots of
sense)
checked/cleaned/repainted most everything else

May not sound like much to some of the old heads, but it's by far the most
I've ever done at once to a vehicle.

Leaving pulling the heads for next time...

I put the engine in yesterday and tried to start it, got 1/2 turn on crank,
then nothing.  Went thought it today, double checked everything, recharged
battery, it started right up.  That is the sound of victory.  Now it runs,
it's registered, etc., we got a foot of snow (Montana) and I'm denied the
obligatory drive around the block :-(   Oh well, soon enough.  Did get my
annual dose of CO just letting it run in the garage (door open, of course).
Now for the little things; get brake lights to work again, new shocks, etc.

Thanks for the bandwidth, this was a bit of a vent, but of the good kind :-)))
Nothing like a smooth running machine to show for the dirty hands.  Now that's
satisfaction.
