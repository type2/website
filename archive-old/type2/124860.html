Subject: Baywindow FAQ

Hi Richard,

I've been meaning to write you for quite a while anyway. A few weeks ago I 
surfed into your web site on account of some parts you were offering for 
sale. I remember being very impressed with the quanitity and quality of 
information I found there. Every time I visit and read, I learn some new 
tips. In fact, tonight after reading your invitation for feedback, I think I 
found the solution to a loud engine that sounds like it has an exhaust leak 
in your section on Plugging Air Injection Ports.

Overall, I find the FAQ to be of as high quality as the rest of the website. 
I found myself often trapped by pages that wouldn't let me go back, so I had 
to go back to the list message and click on the link to take me back to the 
FAQ home page.

There are frequent spelling errors which I didn't make a list of.

The smog law section needs to be updated now that Gov signed the AB.

Otherwise thanks for a great resource that has been of great help to me. In 
fact, I need to write a thank you note to the list as well. Many people's 
suggestions helped me bring the Porsche engine project in the 74 Safare to a 
conclusion.

Thanks again,

John
