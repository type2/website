you will need to take it to VW who can test it using a jig thing
unless you are lucky that is. without the jig thing test will not
be accurate as spindle needs to be set straight. Solenoid does 
not need jig to test, if it throws it works.
To remove speedo pull all wires and cable from back, undo two
screws right up and under dash at 3 &amp; 9 o'clock, you need rubber 
fingers for these, and turn speedo body out of retaining hooks.
to get clearance to remove speedo from between dash &amp; shelf you 
will need to take out large screw to the left of shelf (LHD?) 
near to the door to pull the shelf down slightly.
Hope this is helpful
