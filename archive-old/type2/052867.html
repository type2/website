Subject: 77 Checkup

I Purchased a 77 Westy last fall (my first bus) and will be taking her on the 
our first long trip together. The question i have is can a dealer/mechanic 
hook their computer up to the bus and tell if any of the FI componets are bad 
or near bad? The bus seems to be running fine to me (but being my first bus 
how would i know), but due to the upcoming trip i would like to make sure 
everything is in top running order.
