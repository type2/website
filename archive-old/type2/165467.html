&gt; &gt; By that criteria, just about every engine is a '30s (or earlier) design.
&gt; &gt; Watercooled inline fours were in common use in the oughts and teens, so
&gt; &gt; the engine of a Prius is even older than our VWs!
&gt; &gt;

&gt;     FWIW, the first electric/gas hybrid was a Dr Porsche design...(When he
&gt; wasn't stealin' from Tatra he did some pretty good work on his own... ;-)

He designed that hybrid in 1901!  Also, his hybrid was a series
design, which is much more efficient than current parallel designs as the
drivetrain was completely electric.  Way ahead of his time!
