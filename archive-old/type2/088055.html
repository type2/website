Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera fridge questions


[...]

I can't tell you anything about your fridge, but the Dometic in 76 to 79
Westfalias will deplete a fully charged battery in 6 hours.
In Westies, the aux battery is only used to maintain the fridge WHILE you are
driving. When parked, you have to hook up to 110v ac and run it thru the
converter.


&gt; I have a few questions for you folks with the Mobileaire &quot;Iceless&quot; icebox.
&gt; I am getting things tested for our first campout next weekend.  I put a
&gt; frozen bottle of water &amp; a can of pop in it at about 4:00PM yesterday.  It
&gt; was about 90F in the van.  I then checked the temp in the fridge this
&gt; morning.  It was exactly 40F.  My aux. battery voltage was down to 8.7V.  Is
&gt; this normal?  Is it OK for the fridge to use about 25% of the battery
&gt; capacity in12-15 hours? Thanks.
