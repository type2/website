Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Yet another tire thread... Kelly Pathfinder Tires?

Ron's right, of course. 

To give the shop SOME credit, they're true 2 ply tires. The ply
&quot;rating&quot; isn't on the sidewall and I couldn't find anything on the
Kelly site either. Judging by the way other tires are rated, I'd guess
3 or 4. Either way, they're NOT the spec I was led to believe.

The 95 load rating is ok however, which is the ONLY reason I'm going
to give them a shot. Well, that and the fact that they're a national
chain and I can raise Cain anywhere I decide to stop and give up on
these things. ;)  My only real concern is the side-to-side torque on
the sidewalls. But they aren't mushing out like I feared they would.
But it's raining and I'm not working the tires like I could on dry
pavement.

I've gotta say though that these tires are a HUGE improvement over
what was on there. The bus tracks straighter than it ever has and I
feel more positive wheel to tire control. Just the change of tires
gave the bus a more confident feel, more like the Rav 4 I drove for a
few days not too long ago than the wallowing slug it was.

Either way, it's too late to do anything tonight. I'm going to give
them a go and see what happens. I've got tires with better ratings in
the rear so at least my arse end is solid. ;)
