&gt;My '76 has a PDP air conditioner, minus the compressor. Questions:

&gt;1. Does anyone on the list have a working PDP unit?

No, but ask me again in 2 weeks.

&gt;2. Where did the compressor go? Where is the pulley?

Pulley is behind the fan, compressor mounts via a bracket on the left side
of the fan housing.

&gt;3. Could I retrofit a generic compressor? (I would be retrofitting the
&gt;system with R-134).

Anything is possible with enough engineering.  I'm going to use a generic
rotary compressor and mount it where the air pump used to be.

&gt;I am aware of the issues wrt using an a/c with an air-cooled engine.

Doesn't bother me either.  I don't see it being a problem.
