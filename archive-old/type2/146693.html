Subject: bowden tube - was: Where is the engine supposed to be?

Well, I have an old one, but the rubber on the outside is broken and the 
outside metal &quot;wrapping&quot; is rusted.  The tube is still pretty solid, but 
I'm not sure if I should use it or not.  It seems like there is also 
another tube inside of the metal &quot;wrapping&quot; so I might go ahead and use 
it.  The older tube that I have uses metal ends instead of the newer 
tubes that have plastic ends.  Plus, I think I remember the newer tubes 
being slightly longer than the older tubes.

Do you think a longer tube (with more bend) will lead to faster cable wear?

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; I have found that the new replacement bowden tubes are crap. Try to 
&gt; save your old one. You probably cannot pull the broken cable out of 
&gt; it? Unfortunately, if you keep trying, the cable binds completely and 
&gt; you will never save the tube. Before you try to pull it out, try to 
&gt; push back out the rear. Then cut the cable on the front end of the tube.
