DING! DING! DING! We have a winner!!!!  Yes, gasoline and air are only
flammable over a fairly limited range of mixtures.  This is where &quot;lean&quot;
and &quot;flooded&quot; come from.  There just is not enough oxygen inside a gas
tank for flame to get a grip.  It is essentially in a &quot;flooded&quot; condition
full time.  At the same time, take out 99% of the gasoline, put in air,
add a spark (from a torch, say) and you can get an impressive explosion!

As a side note, the range of mixtures varies signifficantly depending on
fuel.  The gas/air range is narrow, the alcohol/air range is wider, the
ether/air range is *much* wider!

&gt; LOL... what we make it thru as kids!

I tend to think of it as &quot;chlorine for the gene pool&quot; :-)
