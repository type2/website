&gt;My 1971 camper has a leak that for the life of me, I cannot find the

&gt;It seems to be dripping down from above . . . .

In my 1970 Westfalia, substantial water damage in the rear of the bus
was caused by holes in the roof.  The holes were located under the two
rubber bumbers (2 inch rubber cylinders) which are the rear mount for
the luggage rack.  As built, a sheet metal screw went through the
luggage rack, through the rubber bumper, and into the metal of the roof. 
Water got between the rubber and the roof and, using the screw  hole as
a starting point, rusted some big holes.  About 6 years ago now, I bathed
the bumper w/ clear silicone caulk to stop the leak and never got back to
actually fixing the problem.  Its still on my to-do list.  I'd check the roof if I
were you.  good luck,
