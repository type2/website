These guys are the BEST!  If you live in Seattle, be sure you take your
vahicle to them.  I just took my Vanagon in for an oil cooler seal (I just
got a bonus at work, so I felt lazy) and they quoted $300.  I just called
them for the total, and it was only $65.  I asked why, and they said it
wasn't the cooler, only a few small leaks around the engine.  They cleaned
them up, replaced a few gaskets and I'm on my way.  

They could have easily charged me for the $300 and not done anything, I
wouldn't have even noticed.
