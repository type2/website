Subject: Re: [T2] Busdepot, thou hast overpackaged my grommets
  (non-rant)

Which reminds me....

Billy, don't complain too much as the last order I got was finally 
packaged quite well...but of course it had a couple of H4's in it 
as wll as some really heavy stuff.

Ron,

What I can't believe is that your site let me order 4 filters, but didn't 
remind me to get the oil change gaskets with them....&lt;grin&gt;

Maybe a special deal with each filter packaged with a gasket set?

Just trying to help....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ron, and y'all,

snipped
&gt; 
&gt; Pulled it open, unwrapped 12 New York Times worth of newspaper and came up
&gt; with two windshield wiper grommets the size of nickels.
&gt; 
 Checked the postage, almost seven dollars!!!
 
 Now, I didn't pay for that postage because it was a backordered item,
 obviously fired out on the quick when it became available, and I appreciate
 the 'Depot's fine efforts, but Ron, you guys took it in the shorts moving my
 $1.60 worth of rubber around.
 
&gt; Just sayin' I would've been happy with them dropped in an envelope with two
&gt; stamps.
&gt; 
&gt; Much appreciation Ron, just lookin' out for ya...
