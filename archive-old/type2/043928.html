Subject: [T2] Re: oil filler tube needed pronto

&quot;. Rocky
Mouintain Motor Works is worth a try, as is Bus Depot.

For those metal shards  to get to the filter, they will first have to run
through the bearings to the pan then to the oil pump and finally to the
filter. A bearing will get starved if a single shard  clogs an oil
galley.
If it makes it through the galley and into a bearing, it will score the
bearing and crank journal. That's one shard of a few thousandts inch size
or larger.&quot; 
	I tried RMM, Bus Depot, J-Bugs, Real Source, WCM... none of them
have it listed in their catalogs. 

As far as the metal shards go, I guess I'll just have to pray that I got
them all. Miracles do happen, you know.  At least my engine isn't a GEX.
ha ha ha.
