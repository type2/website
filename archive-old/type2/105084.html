Subject: Re: [T2] blue smoke startup

Hi Chris,

Have you looked at your air filter? For a while I used to get a 
fair-sized blue cloud at start-up until an overdue tune-up where I 
discovered oil deposits in the air box . After replacing the air filter 
the problem disappeared.

YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; from the archives, and recent threads, a blue smoke cloud right at

&gt; I have hydraulic lifters, and have never adjusted them. Is this why 
&gt; this
&gt; happened? Should I have been?
