Subject: Shipping costs

Recently, I've noticed excessive shipping charges from part vendors.

One order from CO was for a few rubber grommets that weighed no where near 1lb and the charge was $9.59. Another package came from GA was again a small plastic item and the charge was $10.50. Both times the part were put in a box that was too large but the parts arrived safe and sound.

I should also mentioned that both were phone orders. When I quoted the website shipping cost over the phone, I was told it would be only $5-6 and both times I was charged much more.

Has anyone else noticed this with their orders? I know the cost of gas is sky high but...

PS. This latest VW ad is pretty good:
