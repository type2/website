Jen,
The difference is in not only the exterior grade of sheet metal that the 
boxes are made of but also the core.  When you look inside the box it has a 
series of metal fins that surround the j-tube or exhaust tube.  I've even 
heard of some heater boxes not even having that core.  I have the good ones 
on my Westy and it cooks but on my Double Cab I have the cheap ones and I 
freeze even with the smaller area that needs heating.  The previous owner is 
the one I can thank for those cold mornings.  I say spend once, cry once and 
get the better boxes.  Just keep in mind that with the 6+ feet that the warm 
air has to travel in the heat tube before it hits you can cool it down 
additionally.

Good luck,


Don
