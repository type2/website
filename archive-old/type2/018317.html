&gt; OK--I've got no rod and no shutter. It doesn't appear to be an easy sort of
&gt; installation, at least not until the engine is out. This looks to me as if
&gt; it is a &quot;wait 'till the engine blows&quot; type of repair...will the absence of
&gt; these parts greatly shorten the time until I need to replace them?

Crap, it's much worse for you.  Having no thermostat is one thing but
having no flaps on a Type 4 is really bad.  

The left side flap serves to direct a certain amount of air over the oil
cooler when it is open.  It's hard to explain but you can see how it
works with the flaps installed.  The problem with removing the flaps is
that you now have NO cooling air being directed over the oil cooler. 
The oil cooler, due to its position in the Type 4 engine, will receive
no air flow if the flaps are removed.  This is a Very Bad Thing and you
need to correct it immediately.  It's a matter of removing the fan
housing and replacing the flaps.  It can be done with the engine in.  

But then if you want to wait until the engine blows, it shouldn't be too
long...

I won't get into the thermostat debate in this post but it's not a
matter of opinion whether you need the flaps, it is a fact that you need
them.  

I'd like to find the idiots that are removing the flaps from these
engines and just smack 'em upside the head and ask 'em if they ever
think about anything before they do it.  I mean, it's clear just by
working the flaps by hand with the fan shroud out what they do and how
necessary they are.  It should be obvious.  Well, that's my rant for the
day, sorry it's bad news for you, but at least you know what your next
project is.

Good luck
