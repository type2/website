The valave covers only go on correctly, one way, with the VW logo upside
down....

Use loctite 518, gasket eliminator on the covers, and they will never leak
again, if installed correctly...

As for the pushrod tubes, they are an acquired skill, I still goof them up
on occasion..Use the VITON type, they are super tough, and do not leak
often..

&gt; Hi, Eric here.
&gt;
&gt; I am an idiot.  I bought an 82 Vanagon.  Still working on how to service
&gt; it!
&gt;
&gt; Anyways, here is my question.
&gt;
&gt; I have an 82, with a 2000 air-cooled.
&gt;
&gt; I replaced the push rod tube seals, and valve cover gaskets.  Used
&gt; genuine VW parts.  After I was done, I test drove it, and noticed that
&gt; the oil was spurting out on the driver side.  I had noticed that the
&gt; valve covers are angled in a certain way, with a pressed &quot;eye-bolt&quot; or
&gt; &quot;ring&quot; on one corner.   I flipped around the valve covers, with the
&gt; little ring on the top corner.  I had put it on incorrectly the first
&gt; time.  I am still leaking oil from the covers, and I think the old
&gt; tubes.
&gt;
&gt; Should I have replaced the tubes with new ones?
&gt;
&gt; Should I have put a thin film of bearing grease on cover half  under the
&gt; gasket?
&gt;
&gt; And lastly can you out the valve covers on wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Another help would be how to seat the tubes back in without having to
&gt; tap them in from the rocker valve heads.  I am sure that I might have
&gt; done a little scoring on the surrounding metal.
&gt;
&gt; Like I said, I'm an idiot.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; Eric.
