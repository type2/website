Subject: Re: [T2] EFI swaps

Should be no problems except for mounting stuff.
You'll have bigger valves which will make for slightly
less low end grunt - maybe. If you are concerned about
too much fuel (should not be a problem) I suppose you
could put a T3 adjustable fuel pressure regulator on
it and that would allow adjustment of fuel mixture
across the board. The FI system doesn't know there is
200cc difference - it only knows airflow and
temperature. -BaH

 Can you put a '78 Federal EFI system on a 1800? What
 problems would a 200cc
 difference make?
