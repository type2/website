Subject: Re: [T2] Rear torsion adjustment - request for comments

On my 71 one notch was too much and burned up my Yoko's in 17k miles with
too much spring.  I would HIGHLY recommend getting a little plastic degree
thingy and getting the angle to what Bentley says (would think Haynes would
say the same thing).  To get mine right I had to move both the inner and
the outer splines.  I would also use talc unless you like sqweeks...

My ride height looks good but I haven't noticed any real difference in
handling.  Then again since it already handled like it was on rails it's
hard to tell, although over 130mph it does feel slightly more stable ;)

My opinion is to go for it, FWIW.

Subject:  [T2] Rear torsion adjustment - request for comments


My 71 westy has more than usual butt-sag, plus the camber seems off
(splayed out at bottom) which _might_ be due to the sag, but I'm not
sure.  If it were a swing-axle, I'd say that's why, but do IRS trannys
also undergo camber changes with suspension flex?

Anyhoo I'm contemplating the spring-plate adjustment procedure.  I've
gone over the stuff in the Type2 library and read some posts in the
archives going back to '96 or so.  I've read Haynes for the geometry
info.  The procedure doesn't sound overly difficult (heh, heh, sure).

I'm thinking I should just pull the plate off the outer end of the
torsion bar and crank it down one notch (and therefore raise the rear by
one notch-worth).  Do I also need to do the inner end -- ie, will just
one notch at the outer end be too much?

Comments on this and on your experiences with ride height and handling
after spring plate tweakage would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe
