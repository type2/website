Subject: Re: [T2] Just a Couple of Questions

[...]

&gt; There is a port between the two right intake runners on the air distribution
&gt; box.  On my bus there is a vacuum hose that goes to the fuel pressure
&gt; regulator.  Disconnect the hose, plug it, and connect your gauge to the
&gt; manifold.

WHOA!!  This makes it sound like you are leaving the pressure regulator
disconnected and running the engine at idle. This will raise your fuel
pressure 3 psi and cause the mixture to be rich.

You should tee the gauge into that circuit and leave everything connected.
