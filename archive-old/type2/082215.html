Tony,

The only other way I just thought it could be possibly be done, is to
run the door through a planer----if you could find one big enough----

But--- The blades would chew up the veneer by the time you got down to
the glue side of the stuff----too thin--too fragile--the blades would
create tooth picks, by the time it got to the material you wanted---

woodworking bus/westy owners... 

My neighbor has a Westy that they take out 2/3 times a year (NFS, I
asked). I built a small cabinet for them from birch plywood which leads
to my next question: A commercial building supply warehouse saves their
cut-outs and culls (bad one side) from their door inventory for me. Lots
of birch and al- most as much oak. Most doors are 1 3/4 thick and I've
used the &quot;slabs&quot; to make built-in cabinets and desks, etc. What I'd like
to find out, is if anyone has or can come up with a method of slicing
the veneer from the doors. The doors are &quot;solid&quot; with a wooden edging
and a low-density chipboard filler. If you've done much
woodworking/remodeling, I'm sure you know the type of door I'm speaking
of...I'd love to have a really cheap source of plywood to redo my bus in
oak... 
TIA for any tips...
