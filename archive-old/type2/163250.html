I also  have that problem of ring sealing, even with Total Seal gapless
piston  rings, and it still lets significant oil through the pump,
which is of  concern for pre-paint surface blasting contamination.
They told me the seal  is too good, and the compressor is pulling it
through the intake valve  guides. Maybe so. What do you think?




Hey Guys  I think the problem is that you can't seat them like you do  in a 
vehicle by putting a load on them and then creating back pressure.  I  would 
think that they will seat in time.  later  mark D
