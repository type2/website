&gt; I just got back from spending a week+ in and around
&gt; Coos Bay and the VW bus scene is slim to none up
&gt; there! I
&gt; saw a few buses parked here and there but the total
&gt; lack of any in the wrecking yards was a
&gt; disappointment.
&gt; 
&gt; I am spoiled with the yards here in Fresno, Calif.
&gt; 
&gt; I am contemplating moving there, but it would mean
&gt; the end of good used parts once I run out of my
&gt; stash
&gt; here......

You'll find more inland - and actually usable, too!
There are buses out there, but woefully rotted or else
recent immigrants! About 4-5 hours north is Beaver
Creek Bob and he probably has all the coastal VW's
that have been available in the past twenty years(+)
He's at the north end of the town of Beaver. If you go
to meet him, plan on a few hours to BS! {Bob Wilkinson
- latest phone # I have for him is 503-398-5869. If
it's not good, try substituting 541 area} Other than
that, Longview, WA (just over the river) has some in
wrecking yards and is home to one of the biggies,
Averre's (Steve- 360-425-1119). Autosport Int'l is in
Vancouver, WA, which is really north Portland.

I think you'll have more gloomy weather than in Fresno
area, but for a layed-back lifestyle it is top of the
list! -BaH
