Doug,

      When I registered my 76 Westy they classified it as a car.  With my 82
they say if it has a stove built in it is a motorhome.  I think I miss my
bay window Westy.

&gt; Sounds like the DVM isn't quit sure of their own rules.  About a year ago
when I
&gt; registered my 74 Westy in Oregon they told me that if the
&gt; vehicle had a &quot;permanent bed&quot; then it was classified as a motorhome.  If
the bed
&gt; wasn't permanent then it was classified as a car.
