&gt;	Just currious but how large of a bike can you put on the front of a
&gt;westy?  

Mountain bike with cro-moly frame is probably the limit.  Possibly two.

(Absolutely NO HUFFYS with the super-heavy steel frame... This of course
puts the _650 HONDA_ right out.)

&gt;I own a 84 honda 650 and think this is also a good idea.  

I think this is a good idea too but then I have a scar from the time I
thought road luge on a regular skateboard (in swim trunks) was a good
idea.

&gt;Is there a weight limit?

Yep, it's in my owner's manual:  

Amt of motorcycle weight suspended from
front bumper: 50lbs
