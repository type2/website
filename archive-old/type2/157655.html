&gt; We got a screener DVD this week and watched last night on our small TV.

&gt; Go see with a bunch of VW-friends  and have a great time, else you

&gt; bursts of comedy.

I have the consumer DVD and it is quite viewable on the small
screen.  Only a few scenes really beg for a big screen.  The DVD has both
widescreen and pan-and-scan version of the movie.  It was well-received at
the rather chilly screening at BBBXI

&gt; Has anyone seen DVD of &quot;Cars&quot;? does it stand up?

I haven't seen this in the theater, but the DVD is a howl.  The bonus
features include footage about the research that the makers did along
Route 66.  You won't look at Amboy the same way again!
