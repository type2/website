Subject: FW: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

We deal with this every day. We find buses on the road side, back of houses
and in fields and rescue them from the inevitable crush. Every bus is looked
over carefully to make sure it is no longer road worthy before a complete
dismantle (every nut bolt washer and piece of glass is removed and made
available to bus owners like you). I throw nothing away. A bus is worthy of
more road miles we fight hard to regain the title and keep it going.

Subject: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!




Hello everyone,

In reference to a recent post concerning a bus for sale, I did a follow-up
and found the bus had been trashed.  Please - don't scrap your buses or
beetles!!  Personally I am from Quebec, Canada where buses, yet alone spare
parts are extremely hard to find.
