George and fellow list members....

(Older bus nut approaches the soapbox, and wonders if it's wise to try
getting on)

FWIW....back in the days when these upright engined beasts were new, this
list member was a VW dealer mechanic, and changed hundreds of mufflers (well
maybe not hundreds actually, but after 25 or so, who's counting)...back in
those days, dealers didn't buy aftermarket ANYTHING...it wasn't
religious....and the German kits only came with &quot;one small hole &amp; one large
hole gaskets&quot;....so like good little boys &amp; girls we put them on the way the
engineer designed them....

Part of my first training coarse in late 71 was engine tuning ...two days on
setting up the typeIV dual carb engine (Can anyone guess why) and one day on
everything else...so obviously I had to ask the question about these
gaskets....answer seemed logical, so I accepted it....

Add a thick German accent to taste...

&quot;You don't want the air blowing back &amp; forth quickly because it doesn't get
into the manifold pre-heat pipe to warm it up as well....restricting one end
slows down the flow(allows better thermal action)....and warms the manifold
more evenly&quot;

It wasn't til a lot of off-shore gasket sets started showing up in the
marketplace that I ever saw two large hole gaskets in the same kit...I wrote
it off to being too lazy to make two different gaskets....

Just my $.02.

Den.
