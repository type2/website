&gt; This is, I suppose, a difference in attitude, and nothing much will 
&gt; come from debating it. I tend to think that it's essential to have the 
&gt; bottom end (the &quot;shortblock&quot;) in the best possible shape. Everything 
&gt; else can be changed as needed -- heads, cylinders, pistons, ignition 
&gt; and fuel, cooling -- if you have a solid bottom end. Everything else 
&gt; can be a weekend job. But a solid bottom end is non-negotiable. It 
&gt; turns a repair job into a rebuild.

&gt; &gt;If I had a GEX and I was doing the repair work myself I would just

  Hello Guys  I agree with Richard here  fix the head on the GEX and save 
your money for either a good reman. or a good core to rebuild.  The problem I 
have seen with GEX is that the bottom end might not be any good, including the 
case. I have seen mixed pistons , rods, cranks turned too far etc. etc etc,  
mostly pure junk.  Anyway the price they are quoting is way out of line   later
