Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vacuum gauge

Thanks David, I guess at this point I'll have to consider it opinion rather
than fact that vacuum decreases with altitude.
I have a concern because some folks on the list are getting 16inHg + at idle.
The best I get is around 14. I'm hoping that's attributable to the lighter air
density up here but I'd feel so much better if I knew this was a fact.
Thanks again,
Tom

&gt; Tom,
&gt;
&gt; I more-or-less agree with Rick that it shouldn't make a difference with the
&gt; type of vacuum gauge that I have, but I have a vague recollection that I
&gt; was seeing lower vacuum at higher altitudes.  Only problem is that it has
&gt; been a couple of years since I drove the bus much above sea level, and I
&gt; can't remember for sure.  How's that for a straight answer?  :)
