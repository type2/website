Subject: Re: [T2] Find Of a Lifetime!!--78 Westy,42,000 original miles!

Probably one of those &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; deals. Buys &quot;old car&quot; cheap only to find it is worth a cool $2M... 

&lt;Neither am I, but '61 is the first year of production for the
Jaguar E-series (XK-E)... Might be a very rare D-type or an
even rarer XKSS, but both of those models were racers and
the surviving ones are &quot;known&quot;. Might be a '59 XK-150, not
as rare but very pricy...Or, it might be an XKE, but the year
is wrong...&gt;
