Subject: Re: Help! '76 FI problems

Had this same problem with the rebuilt motor in our 82 Westy.  Tried all the
fixes list and then some. When I got to the injectors getting power but not
spraying I pulled all the injectors out and tested on the bench with a 12
volt source.  Also pulled the four from the old motor(soon to be rebuilt and
ready for the next time).  The results were as follows:

When 12 volts were applied across the terminal of the injector only one of
the four in the rebuilt motor gave an audible click.  Of the four out of my
old motor, all four gave a click.  Hmmmmm........ Took the whole lot of them
to a shop to have them looked at.  End result was eight injectors that got a
cleaning, even though only three REALLY needed it.

Hope this helps!

Mark
