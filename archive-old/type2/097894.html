&lt;&lt; COSTCO now sells a Chinese-made copy of the early VESPA motor scooters.  
They look to be pretty nicely screwed together and finished, but I have no 
info. about actual performance, etc.


Locally, 'Bargains Only' stores are selling electric scooters for just under 
$100.00 [down from ~$300.00].  


FWIW.....

Although mostly limited to trucks at the moment, China has an automobile
industry that's just starting up...Sooner or later, someone - Malcolm
Bricklin? - is gonna get interested enough to build 'em there and sell 'em
here...Probably at a very low cost. Imagine a chinese VW...(available thru'
your Sears catalog, just like the old Allstates ?-)
