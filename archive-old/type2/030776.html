I have the same bus. 

I would check the ground for the whole system first. If the ground is
disconnected then the engine will not catch. It is located in the front
left side of the engine compartment near number 3. It is a black wire that
comes out of the wiring harness that originates near the battery on the
right hand side. To find it follow the wire loom from where it attache.
You will notice the loom splitting off and getting thinner and thinner as
you traverse from the right to the left side. Keep following the center of
the loom until there is only one black wire coming out of it. That is the
wire I am talking about. Make sure it is well connected and that it is
clean.

If that is good and it still doesn't catch then you can try replacing the
points, condensor and cap, and tuning it up. Get the Green Bentley book to
help you. Feel free to p-mail me with more questions, as I am quite
familiar with this engine now.

Hope this helps.
