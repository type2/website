Subject: 15 axles all in a row, ready to go

That's exactly what I found at the Ecology wrecking yard in Wilmington CA today.

I was walking back and stopped at the pile that sometimes has type IV motors and
instead found all 15 of them lined up and ready for the picking.

most of them were disc brakes and were wheel to wheel, including the booster and
MC.

There were three or four drum brake axles in the bunch

Happy pickins

Scott
