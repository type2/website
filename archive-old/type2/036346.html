For the past week we've had four methods discussed: pressure bleeding, 
vacuum pump bleeding, foot pedal pumping, and gravity. Not enough was 
said about gravity.

Bentley recommends pressure bleeding, but I take George's point and don't 
care to see my reservoir disintegrate on me. However, there have been 
cautions about every one of these methods (except for gravity) that are 
serious and credible. 

One is almost left with the view that the safest thing to do is not to 
bleed the brakes at all! But on reflection, that is surely wrong. Not 
only is it good practice to flush the brake lines at recommended 
intervals -- it's also necessary to bleed them after replacing any part 
of the hydraulic system.

So what shall it be? How do we get these brakes bled?
