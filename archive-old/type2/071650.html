Hoe boy....
hollie...
repeat after me:
&quot;I can do anything&quot;.....
and then believe it....
Otherwise youse in a *heap* a trouble....
well..ok...maybe not that bad
you need to get the front wheels off..now...if someting is in there chewing up
the bearings, brakes or whatever this could be a *real* short trip..
the brake rotors should look smooth and shiny on their flat sides...really
*look* On older buses the pads stick in the caliper and wear the rotor
tapered..thinner toward the center near the hub and wider at the outside
rim...This will make a weird dragging noises..and it's common on buses from
wet climates...
If you don't have one, go get a heavy duty floor jack. like the 2 ton jobs
from the pacific rim for 69 bucks...you will use it *all* the time...(easy to
haul in the bus under the rear seat) jack up the center of the front axle and
put the axle on the nifty stands you bought at the same time...shake, rattle
and roll the wheels and check for play...you will get some back and forth as
the slop comes out of all the steering linkage...check carefully the center
pin on the axle tube..these mounts rust off..and may have been cobbled
up...shaking hands on top and bottom of the wheels should give only the *idea*
of motion..more than that and your into bearings somehow..
The engine.....this is not a simple bear to work on...long gone is the &quot;stick
and rock&quot; technology of the 1500 cc single port bus....
get the Robert Bently book...it shows what things are *supposed* to be like...
Avoid any mechanic under 35 years old...find someone who was working on these
things when they were new..
I suspect the engine may be ok..but the smell and the noise is all from the
exhaust..and what a joy to replace the rusty oily parts (any idea how things
can be coated with goo and rusted out at the same time?? never could figure
that one..)
You will end up spending some money and cutting your hands all up...
Vibration..ignore the roar of the bad exhaust...is it *pulling* smoothly? or
is the gear shift rod showing node and waves as the speed goes up?..
Compression test...(better still is a leak down test) that will tell more than
your ears and butt can...
Can I give you a friendly &quot;What *were* you thinking????&quot;
I'm toying with the idea of pulling a 66 kombi out from under the tree where
it has sitting since before you were born and putting on the road....so I
understand
But I've *done* this kinda stuff before....
A late bus in &quot;iffy&quot; shape is not a car to start learning on..
Heck , a 79 with the tank full of varnish has stopped my best efforts to get
it running..(I *will* prevail if I have to take it down to the last nut and
bolt and start over)
Get both the Muir and the Bentley books...read em'..wander out to the bus and
look...get the coveralls and watch cap so you can slide under this thing and
have a look-see... make a list....and get back to us...

steve....
