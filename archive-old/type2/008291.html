&gt; Hey, no problem. Basically, what I said was to avoid GEX, MOFOCO, and
Fast
&gt; German Auto. I've heard good things about Mark Stepens, SIR, and Bob
Donalds.
&gt; Bob is located in Boston, Mass., and can be reached through the LiMBO web
&gt; site.
&gt;  You might also try getting one through Ron at the Bus Depot, he is
located in
&gt; PA., which is better than dealing with a company in CA. Also, as for core
&gt; charges on engines from the mail order places, it'll cost almost as much
as
&gt; the core charge to
&gt; ship it to CA, then they'll say your block was'nt rebuildable, so no
refund.
&gt; How do you know they did'nt rebuild it and sell it to the next guy? You
don't.
&gt; Hope this was of some help.     Jeff
