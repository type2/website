Hello Everybody:

Has anyone out there ever lowered the suspension on a bus??  I'm not talking about slamming it on the ground, but more like a 2 inch drop, especially for the front end.  I do a lot of mountain (OK, really a big hill) driving, with lots of windy twists.  Lowering the center of gravity would make it handle better.  I know the best way to lower almost any suspension is to either get lowered springs or dropped spindles, but nobody makes dropped spindles for a late bus.  Twisting the torsion leaves would work, but would make the ride a little harsh.  Anybody have any suggestions??

Thanks!
