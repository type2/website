Subject: Hydraulic Lifters

I'm getting ready to rebuild the 2.0L carb engine in my 79 bus (engine came
out of a 73 bus but was aftermarket)
It currently has (as far as I can tell using ratwell_dot_com) solid
rods....Where would I look if I wanted to purchase Hydraulic rods (and
lifters)??
I guess also, is it recommended to even run hydraulic lifters/rods (if
adjusted properly over  time).

Thanks.
