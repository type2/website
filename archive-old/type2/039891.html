the automatic when working is a reliable and strong tranny BUT it is not a
manual, and it has it's own quirks.  that said

&gt; My body is shot, but the engine is good, and I have found for $350 a very
&gt; solid, rust free '73 westy body with no engine.  It does have an auto tranny
&gt; that has good clean fluid and seems like it would work correctly, but I know
&gt; nothing about them.

the van had two different auto trannies, the 76 had a later version with
the Govenor shifter, the 73 (first year with auto I think) had the earlier
vacuum shifter.  they are close but not identical.  you will need to find
a place to get the proper vacuum for the shifter from your intake.  and I
don't think the older auto tranny is as good as the later ones, also later
versions were still used in other VW's as late as 91 so parts are
relatively avaliable. 

HOWEVER converting to a manual tranny is not for the faint of heart, it
can be done but it is NOT a bolt fit, sticking in the newer auto tranny
though is a lot easier, and there are a lot more of them out there to pick
from.

&gt; 	So, I have come full circle.  Please help me understand the peculiarities
&gt; of the automatic transmission so I know what to look for when installing the
&gt; engine, etc.
