&gt; I don't think all of the busses are aircooled.  Even the ones that look like 
&gt; late model bay windows have the black grille looking think on the front 
&gt; clip.  This appears to be a radiator suggesting that these busses are 
&gt; waterboxers.

Water cooled yes, waterboxers no.  They use an inline four engine from (IIRC) the early Golf.
