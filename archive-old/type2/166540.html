Subject: Re: [T2] E-Brake vs. Foot brake

I use a similar method to that used by Busahaulic to adjust the rear 
brakes. It is important to recheck several times for the brakes 
rubbing after adjustment by pressing the pedal and spinning each wheel.

Have you checked for slack in the e-brake cables? There is a screw 
mechanism up under the front of the vehicle that lets you set the 
overall tension and the tension in each cable to ensure that you get 
even force applied to both wheels. Once you have adjusted the rear 
brakes, adjust the tension until you only need 3 clicks (IIRC) to set 
the e-brake. As an aside, an age old mechanics trick to convince 
people that their brakes have been &quot;done&quot; is to tighten up the ebrake 
cable so much you need to be superman to haul it out one click! ;)

Martin.
