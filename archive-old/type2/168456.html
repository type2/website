Subject: Re: [T2] decibel

Bob is referring to sound insulation, and yes the westy interior
provides pretty good sound insulation.

Have you ever driven a bare bus, with no interior? Its LOUD. Sounds
like you're throwing a metal garbage can
down the driveway when you hit a bump. Add the westy interior back and
it ain't so bad.

I'm trying to track down some noise coming from my rear axle(s) or
tranny and I can't.... have to get out
and listen while someone else drives. The noise is pretty loud...
possibly my CVs ending their expected lifespan.
This is a pretty distinguishable noise and I didn't get it until I
heard it from outside. Thats pretty good sound
isolation.

I recently had to throw out the front carpet mat in the front of my
westy... there was no hope on saving it. I replaced it
with the rubber mat from a previous bus. It happened to be raining
that day... I couldn't believe how much more splashing on
the undercarriage I could hear with no carpet there. Every little piece helps.


Sure, you can go out and spend hundreds of dollars on dynamat and
other sound isolating materials, but a properly functioning stock
exhaust with the stock westy interior is not bad at all... even on the
highway.


Eddie



&gt; &gt; that was my first question, a good condition stock exhaust should not
&gt; &gt; be that loud. and a Westy has good insulation.
&gt;
&gt; hahaha.. that's a good one :)  Sorry, but besides all the furniture,
&gt; there is little to no insulation inside that thing, at least compared to
&gt; modern day car insulation.
