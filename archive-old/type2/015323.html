&gt;and nothing 20+ years old ever breaks unexpectedly either.

Unless the vehicle is up on it's maintenance.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Breakdown cover (AA, RAC, AAA etc.) insures against failure.

No it doesn't. It insures partial reimbursement for the tow after
the failure occures.

&gt;&gt;  Periodic maintenance ensures reliability.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  Yep, this is good stuff, but if you don't mind me saying so you
&gt;&gt; could stand to lighten your tone a touch :-).

&gt;&quot;Murphy&quot; doesn't operate via the Deutscshes Methode either (Mach Nicht)

Murphy gets very bored when the DM is in control. He's just waiting for 
the next compromise.

&gt; in a business where failure kills people!

Me to. People can and do die when they get sideswiped on the side of the
road, or
their brakes fail, or the tire blows out, or.......Just check the statistics.
Always sad when a human being is reduced to a statistic when it could have
been
prevented by common sence.

Whether you run out of oxygen on the back side of the moon or snort just
a bit too much cocain, dead is dead. So many of these deaths are preventable
with forethought, knowledge, understanding. Some are the nature of pushing
the envelope into areas not yet visited and involve risk. God bless those
who with forethought accept the risks inherent in the unknown and give us
all the benefits of the new knowledge gained, reducing the risk for those
who follow.

Thank you for the feedback.
