Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray

Todd,

A &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; parcel tray for vw's was always under the dash....

Jc whipme had one for &amp;quot;american&amp;quot; vans that went above the visors

Like this?

or just search for overhead and you will get it.

The other items(sound bars) might be the answer to the speaker threads as 
well....take a look...

Don't know if Ron or any of the other bus vendors have such things, but 
ifthey did and were made for our buses...well...it would be great!



Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Hey guys, I seem to remember seeing somewhere, 
that some VW Bus store had what they called a &amp;quot;Parcel Tray&amp;quot; for sale. 
This tray would attach to the roof of the Bus, 
just above the sun visors... either that, or I'm getting 
confused and it went JUST under the dash.
 
 
&amp;gt; Does anyone know what I'm talking about? And if so, can you tell me where it's sold?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Thanks!
