Subject: Re: [T2] Latest smog news :-(

Here in Sacramento, I have seen what must have been a remote sensing van setup on the on ramp closest to my house. I have seen it operating at least twice in the last year.
Isn't BIG BROTHER wonderful?

&quot;CARB is going to be implementing Remote Sensing in Southern California. What 
does this mean for you???? It means that Remote Sensing Vans will be found at 
freeway on ramps randomly throughout Southern California. They will be measuring 
tailpipe emissions&quot;.
