&gt; At 3000 RPM (this is the max torque point, [101 ft lbs] right??), and in
&gt; third gear, at what speed would I be traveling.

I believe this is the formula.  It will depend on your choice of tires and
your transmission. 

(RPM) * (185R14 tire height in.) * (.002975) / (gear ratio) / (final ratio)

4200 * 26.1 * .002975 / (29/23) / (34/7) = 53 MPH

3000 RPM ... = 38 MPH

I don't have a tach either but assuming my speedo seems accurate because my
driving experience matches the number computed by the formula.
