Subject: Rocker panel repair
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi,

I ordered a repair panel for the sliding door side rocker panel.

What I got is a panel that has a cross section somewhat like an S shape
(with some fantasy).
Supposedly it covers the existing panel. On the top it is held in place
because it 'clicks' into the U shaped channel that holds the rubber door
seal. It fits very snugly into place but now I am now wondering what the
correct procedure is to weld it. Has anyone dealt with this type of
replacement panel? Just weld the underside? I heard someone saying you had
to drill holes in it and weld these in against the old panel?

I hope this description is clear enough.

TIA
