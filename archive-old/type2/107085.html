Oooohhh Tony,

Now you've done it!  I want the 'necker knob'..skip the shade&lt;VBG&gt;

My Grandaddy always had one of those in his 42 Ford pick-em-up....and 
always had the &quot;cheescake&quot; shot of Rita Haworth or some other lady on it...

I really feel like being a little &quot;not&quot; politically correct today!

For all of you &quot;young&quot; whippersnappers out there, you can see one here

and I'm sure that any truck stop would have the more politically incorrect 
ones!

ROTFLOL, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt; Wow,  I want one of those cool windshield visor's like these guys 
&gt; have...looks like your bus is playing poker.  LOL!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever see them for sale?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; My '52 Chevy pickup had one...Expect a lot of horns at intersections, 
&gt; though...
&gt; It's hard enough to see an overhead traffic light already; unless you also
&gt; get the little mirror gizmo that sits on your dash and allows you to see al-
&gt; most straight up... ;-)
