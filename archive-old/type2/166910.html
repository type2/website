The inspection may have been bogus as some reported the mechanic 
tossing all the parts in the dumpster.  You would need to pry open the 
exchangers to see the asbestos pad, and if they wanted to test for 
asbestos, they should have swabbed the inside of the bus.

I had mine replaced on my '74.  I thought it was a great deal at the 
time, but it really wasn't worth it as the new exchangers were not made 
well and  only lasted a year or so.

&gt; Eight or so years ago, VW of America replaced a number of old VW bus 
&gt; heat exchangers at no cost to the owners. They were doing research to 
&gt; see if there was asbestos in them. Mine were replaced at the VW dealer 
&gt; here in Tucson. The replacement included the hoses and the exchangers. 
&gt; I don't know what the result of the research was and I don't know if 
&gt; they found asbestos, but I think that is what they were looking for.
