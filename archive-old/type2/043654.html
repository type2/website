&gt; I have a 76 2000fi... is that one magnesium or aluminum?  Also, how do

The type1 engine is the same case as was used in the bug (type 1) and is a
magnesium alloy. In the US this engine was installed on buses built from
'68-71.  The max *stock* displacement that VW built on this case was
1600cc's.  This case was also available as the &quot;base&quot; option on buses
elswhere in the world for much longer (thru the end of bay window bus
manufacture)

The type4 engine was originally designed for the 411/1 (type 4) and is an
aluminum alloy. In the US this engine was installed on buses built from
'72-83.  The max stock displacement that VW built on this case was
2000cc's.  This engine was available as an upgrade in much of the rest of
the world.

The visual difference between them is that the fan on the type1 engine is
above the engine. The fan is powered by a belt off a pulley that is bolted
to the crank.  this belt runs up to the generator/alternator and power
passes along the shaft of the gen/alt to the fan inside the shroud.  The
fan on the type4 engine is bolted directly to the end of the crankcase
and runs in a shroud that is likewise bolted to the rear of the crankcase.
the alternator on type4 engines is off to the left of the fan shroud and
is powered by a belt that comes off a puley cast into the rear edge of the
fan.

Six years ago when I first joined this list, I would have said that your
'76 bus with a 2000cc engine was definitely a type4 and that it was,
therefore, aluminum.. Today, I say go and look at what type of fan shroud
you have.  It is entirely possible (tho I think it unlikely) that you have
someones &quot;better idea&quot;... a type1 case built out to 2L.

Then there are the true wierdies... there was a 1600 case that was built
for European buses in the late '70s which looks like a type1 but is closer
to the type4, and the type3 engine wich looks like a type4 (fan on the
back) but is actually closer to a type1 case, and the Quantum
Turbodiesel... etc. etc. You just can't trust anything these days. It has
just been too long since any of our buses left the factory.
