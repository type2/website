Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA? 

PS: For the record, I taught at UC San Diego for the past decade.  
That's the institution where the original work on global warming was  
done in the 1950s and 1960s. In &quot;An Inconvenient Truth,&quot; Al Gore  
mentions a study of 928 scientific papers, all of which form a  
consensus in the scientific community. That study was done by an old  
friend of mine, a brilliant woman.

I used to park Peregrine outside what was Roger Revelle's office on  
the campus of Scripps Institution of Oceanography and work early in  
the morning while I watched sea kayakers out under the SIO pier  
before dawn.

I don't take comments about global warming &quot;hysteria&quot; lightly. My  
friends and colleagues did and do this work.
