Subject: Re: [T2] Using tire paint on worn out floor mats

Yes. Works great.

I would suggest vinyl die that you can source at any body shop supplier 
(most towns have 5! &lt;grin&gt;).

$7 - many colors. Comes in spray cans.

&gt;My floor mat is already ripped almost in half, and has a hole cut in it
&gt;for hi beam switch, and is brown, so I did some quick google searches,
&gt;and found some companies advertise their &quot;tire paint&quot; for restoring
&gt;floor mats, mud flaps etc.  Until I get a nice new mat (low on the
&gt;list), I thought I might give it a shot.  Anyone ever try this?  If so
&gt;where might i go to get a smaller quantity?
