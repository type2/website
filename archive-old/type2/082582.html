System #3 - Nut and Bolt - At this late date, this is 
probably the most
&gt; common system, but my least favorite.  I think that 
the bolt spec is M8x15
&gt; with appropriate nut.  After you assemble this, tho... 
be sure and peen
&gt; over some threads on the bolt!  Nothing makes a  panic-
worthy noise like
&gt; that nut coming loose inside your drum at 60mph!! (as 
me how I know :-(

I had a similar experience which tought me not to try to 
re-use damaged horseshoe clips on those pins(DUH). No 
noise, just felt like I was losing power. I was able to 
get off the freeway and into a parking lot before the 
drum locked up altogether.
