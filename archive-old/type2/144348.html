&gt; Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.
&gt;
&gt; Bus mufflers exit at the corner where the slip-stream is.
&gt;
&gt; Buses have a vortex at the rear. No air flow away, it comes back to the bus . Ever see the back of a bus all
&gt; spattered with oil spots when the engine has a small leak? That is because of the vortex. No matter how good
&gt; you think the rear hatch seal is, it leaks! Exhaust gas will enter the inside.

OTOH, thousands of folks have used beetle mufflers with no apparent
mortality.  I used to run one with an &quot;iffy&quot; rear hatch seal and my CO
detector card didn't detect any excess CO.

In fact, the only time I smell exhaust is when reversing with the heater
on, and this only happened with the correct bus muffler!

The best advice is always to run the correct &quot;bus&quot; part, but if you happen
to have a beetle muffler around it will serve well.  You could even get
creative and have a muffler shop fabricate two &quot;bus style&quot; exhaust tubes
for it.  You could pass it off as a 1-year-only South African dual
exhaust!  :)
