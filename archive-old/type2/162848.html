Subject: Re: [T2] Tach

&gt;&gt;I finally installed my tach in the Guac this weekend. I realized that I've
&gt;&gt;been taking it REAL easy on the engine.
&gt;
&gt;How long did it take?
&gt;Was it difficult?
&gt;What kind of tach was it?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is an addition that I am considering for my bus but my money is a
&gt;little tight.  I know not all tachs are created equal but which one
&gt;has the best value for the price?  Can I go down to the local
&gt;autoparts store and pick one up(provided the tolerances are
&gt;acceptable)?
&gt;
&gt;I called the local VWFLAPS I like to goto and they wanted 90 bucks for
&gt;one....thats a little more than my budget of around 50 bucks.



	Rev counter is one of the last gauges I'd consider for Type 
2.  Take the concrete case of the 1600cc giving peak power at 4000 
rpm.  On the flat, let alone uphill, it's very difficult to over-rev. 
The mfr's booklet intones the immortal 'Maximum and cruising speed 68 
mph (110 kph)'  -  in a 4th gear which is an overdrive by Pommie 
standards.  You don't need a tach to do 85 mph downhill in Maori 
overdrive.  		The mfr's booklet advises speed ranges:-
1st gear	 0 - 12 mph
2nd gear	 9 - 25 mph
3rd	15 - 43 mph
4th	25 - 68 mph
		These are solid advice to prevent over-revving and (a 
far worse threat to your engine) lugging.  Drive by feel, rather than 
number  -  using the speedo as an index of revs.  As long as you stay 
in gear and don't slip the clutch, this will do.

	So let 'er rev in those respective speed ranges and you need 
no rev counter.
	Spend your $50 on oil-P, or invest it toward the CHT which 
may be our most desirable gauge.

	If you still want a tach, an easier way than scoring a 
mechanical drive out of magnesiumland is an electric type simply 
wired onto the ignition system.  I got a car-fair used 4-cyl model 
for $10.  (I slapped it on a Jawa 2-stroke twin which has the same 
spark rate per 1000rpm as your 4-stroke 4.)  No battery needed.
	Many new models are really for 8-cyl 4-stroke and will 
therefore not move the needle far for a 4-cyl 4-stroke doing only 
4000 rpm.
