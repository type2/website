Subject: Re: [T2] aftermarket door seals

Hi Richard &amp; Chris,

The only thing I know is that they are brand new (still in sealed bag) and
purported to fit btwn 1968-1979 buses.

And this may be a stupid question but what does NOS mean?

Thanks,
Harry

*&gt; &gt; NO! Spend the extra money and get the German ones from Bus Depot..It is
*&gt; &gt; worth it, I bought aftermarkets first but ended up getting the German

*&gt; &gt; aftermarkets.   The Germans come from the original mold, have the part #
*&gt; on
*&gt; &gt; them and FIT.  Hope this helps!
*&gt; 
*&gt; Do you know anything about the rubber? Are these new or NOS?
