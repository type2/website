Subject: Engine builder on east coast

Hi, 
I seem to recall someone mentioning a VW engine builder in New England.  Can someone please advise this
companies information or another engine builder on the east coast.  I need to replace an upright type1, 2 engine,
so I would appreciate any advice.

Thanks,
