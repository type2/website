Subject: 76 SF/CA help - advice?

hello all,

I have a 76 westy that the motor went out on a little over a month ago,
and im moving from SF to MN in 3 weeks. I had &quot;sold&quot; the bus, but as of
a few days ago and a second cashiers check &quot;lost in the mail&quot; - im stuck
up poo creek lacking any paddle. 

I need to either
A. sell it again in the next few weeks, which I am trying, but I don't
think its going to pan out with such little time left (76 westy on
thesamba_dot_com)

B. get another motor installed so I can drive it back (after driving
there once, then flying back to drive this out as well, or vise versa)

So, anyone know where I can get a bus motor for a 76 westy that will
hopefully make it to MN from SF, about 2,000 miles? I want to rebuild
the one I have, but im not in a position right now to drop $3k on a
rebuild job/etc. 

thanks for any advice or tips you can pass along...

from now on, im asking for a deposit, I cant believe I allowed myself to
get screwed into this position. 

Regards,
Christopher
