Subject: RE: [VB] Product Report - Cleaning Bad connections

I like it. Very complete list. I use Tarn-X from Wal Mart. Cleans all
metals, gold, silver, copper, brass, aluminum, etc.

Subject: [VB] Product Report - Cleaning Bad connections


We've all had the problem with our aging VW's, bad connections that make our
lights dim, slow down turn signals and wipers and if you run fuel injection,
bad connections can leave you without a working fuel system!!  If a fuse or
wire is hot to the touch, that is a good indicator there is a bad
connection.

So what are we supposed to do about bad connections?  Some people will tell
you to get very fine sandpaper and clean them, that may work for the male
end of a spade connector, but how do you get the female end clean and what
about switches?  In reality, using abrasive paper is not the answer, it will
scratch the brass and create more areas for corrosion to set in.

The answer for bad connections is with a spray terminal cleaner.  Here's how
it works:  first off, you must have tight connections between the male and
female connectors and the connectors must be attached firmly to the wire or
you are just wasting your time.  If the connectors are solid and attached to
the wire, seporate them and spray just a short burst on each end, put the
ends together a few times to help brake up the corrosion, then spray one
last short burst on each and reconnect.

The product I use is called &quot;DeoxIT D5&quot; and is also a lubricant and
protectant so it seals the connections against further corrosion.  It is
kind of expensive, $17 for a 5oz can, but it goes a LONG way, you use just a
short burst on each connector.  You will need to go to an electronic supply
house to find it.  

Many electric keyboard people use this stuff to spray on the keyboard
circuitry to keep the sound clear.

Here are some places on our VW's where we need to spray for corrosion:

Head light switch
Ignition switch terminals
Wiper switch
Fuse ends in Fuse panel
Spade connectors on Fuse panel
All spade connectors on instrument panel and wiper motor
Radio Speaker wires
Grounds under dash
Headlight grounds
Light bulbs and sockets (Headlights, Turn signals, Dome lights)
Door Dome light switches
Turn Signal Switch
Horn ring contacts
Brake light switch connectors on master cylinder
Engine spade connectors
Fuel tank sender connectors and ground
Enging wiring grounds
All Fuel Injection connections
Starter wire connections

This is one area that is overlooked way too often, and can cause MANY
problems.  These problems can be simple to overcome with just a little work.
