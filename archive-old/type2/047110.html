Adults sleeping in the cot????  Take a look at early bay window Wesfalia brochures.  It's always mom and dad and three very small kids.  I like the picture that shows how one
of the children is able to sleep on a bed made by sliding the stool in between the rear facing seat and the ice box.

&gt; Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.  Has
&gt; any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you recovered
&gt; from it?
