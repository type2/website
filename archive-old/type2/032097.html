Subject: Re:[T2] Backwards dist. drive (was: George Lyle--He de man.)

Dear John, George and others,

Thanks for the prompt and detailed replies. The more I think about it, the
more I remember about my last rebuild. It seems like the only way to get
it backwards is to drop the distributor drive in while the engine is set
at #1 is at the top of the exhaust stroke, not the compression stroke
(which is real top dead center, yes?), or at one of the other several
possible wrong places that the few camshaft gear teeth afford. The not so
obvious part is that the tic on the fan comes up twice in every engine
cycle: once on the intake stroke and once on the exhaust stroke. So I was
confused about which valve was intake and was lined up on the wrong one at
some point. I probably turned my engine some to look at valves and check
their settings, then lined up by the fan tic after I had my valve covers
on (thinking it was TDC whenever it's pointing up) and dropped the
distributor drive in when I was opposite of TDC. Live and learn.

And once the distributor drive's in, it won't come out unless I use a
magnet and pull it out. So I shoudn't worry about getting my distributor
backwards unless that happens. I should be able to pull my distributor and
do points. etc. with no worries. When I screwed mine up, I must've done it
when I was turning the engine to set valves or something, and then dropped
the distributor drive in at the wrong point in the compression cycle.

Does my analysis sound right, wise VeeDubbers?
