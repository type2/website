&quot;there's some backfiring as it dies -- electrical
problem, then, yes?  After 20 minute wait or so, it starts up and runs
well again until maybe about another half hour goes by, and I begin to
feel that stumbling again, then it dies withing about a minute.
Repeat.  Dipstick is relatively cool to the touch -- no need to grip it
lightly and pass it back and for the between left and right hands, a la
Muir.  The spark looks ok to me, yellow, and strong,&quot;

	From my most recent experience the backfiring DOES indicate
a spark problem. Spark is YELLOW and strong? BAAAAAAD spark. Blue-white is 
what you want. 

1) Do you see the same spark color just after it dies and 20 min. later
when it will start again? I bet you don't.

	I'd start by gapping the points. You said you had fuel in the
carb bowl but not that you'd checked point gap. Points are easier to check!

The problem could be that hot it has no point gap and cold it has a little,
or it could be some kind of thermal-sensitive condensor, or it
could be a loose wire with insulation that gets soft and shorts to something
when its warm.

	After checking the point gap (I've had TWO vacations affected by
point gap, so I sympathize) I'd inspect the primary and secondary wiring
for damage, arcing, etc. If that doesn't get it, replace points, condensor, 
cap and rotor (keep the old ones as spares in case the problem isn't them- 
if it is toss 'em when you've proved it).

	If that doesn't get it, you're down to the coil or the secondary
wires- the big fat ones from coil to distributor and the plugs. If you
can get a volt meter yeah, measure the drop on the coil primary. If you
can't get the volt meter, take a shot, bag and tag what you rememove in case
it isn't the problem, then try the other one. 

	But do tell- lean mixture sometimes backfires too, though I
don't know how... when it dies do you smell gas at the tail pipe if
you crank it? That pretty much proves a spark problem.

	Good luck!
	Bill
