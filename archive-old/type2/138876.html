Hi Barry,

Those are heads designed for D-Jet Fuel Injection. Apparently the D-Jet
system requires such a stable vacuum that the heads were vented back to the
case in order to keep the case pressure as even as possible.

We have a pair of them on the 412 engine destined to power &quot;Franklin&quot;, my
Dad's 1975 westy project. They'll be capped off in our case since they
aren't needed for L-jet FI.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I came across some type 4 heads (from a 914 or a 412) that were vented into
&gt; a 't' going into the oil breather.  These 'vents' were not simply drilled
&gt; into the upper lip of the head, just below the rim where the valve cover
&gt; fits, but were molded in there with some extra support around the holes.
