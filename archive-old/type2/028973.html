OK I'm sure that &quot;Moe&quot; is the kind of guy who would prefer not to be called
an angel.  I was climbing the famous Bus-killer, the Altimont Pass yesterday
when the rubbing block snapped off my points.  No biggie except that I
didn't have a spare.  Called the CHP to let them know I would have my oft'
profiled and harranged bus rolling within an hour and then called for a
friend to bring me a new set of points.  My Aircooled Karma visited me a
moment later.  A Ryder truck pulled up in front of me and three guys got out
and asked what my problem was.  I told them I was waitng for points to be
delivered and the guy with &quot;Moe&quot; on the patch of his shop shirt said, &quot;hold
on...&quot;  He rolled up the Ryder's back door and I saw about 8 flat four
engines and trannies.  He removed the points from a donor distributor, put
them on mine and waited for me to re-install it and get Ms Jonze fired up
again.  By the time I had the timing set, he had pulled away and I didn't
get to thank him properly.  He was headed down I-5 for L.A.

Moe, if you're out there, Thanks,
