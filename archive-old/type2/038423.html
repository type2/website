&gt;I just did that yesterday on my 69. It is pretty easy. I ordered the
entire scraper/crome trim piece from Ron _at_ Bus Depot. All you need to 
do..(snip)

I recently installed one side on my 71 SC, from the entire truck rubber kit 
I got from BD last year, and the fit of this piece is NOT good. Bad enough, 
in fact, that I haven't gotten around to trying the other side. It came..and 
was kept, nicely packaged. As you say.it's easily bent. Mine wasn't, but the 
lower rear curve on it has a 3/8 &quot; gap for about 2 inhes on the most curved 
portion. Glad yours worked out tho' :)
