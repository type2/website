&gt; For whatever it's
&gt; worth, most piston-engine airplanes (think hot-running aircooled engines) 
&gt; burn
&gt; single-weight oil, SAE 40 or 50, and *all* multigrade oils sold for aircraft
&gt; use are at least semisynthetic.

&gt;    FWIW, airplane engines are mostly designed for constant rpm running and
are inspected and replaced/rebuilt at much shorter intervals than automobile
engines...
