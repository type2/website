HI YA'LL,
I just returned to the list after a 10 months
''journey ' into the WORLD of BIKES ARE
BETTER than CAGES aka IBMWR list
 its good to be HOME!!!  Anyway, I have
ordered alot of stuff from the list ,from 
books to watches, and even cameras .I
also order camper parts, and have for a
very long time, as a matter of fact I just
recieved a curtain set from the sponsor
of the WESTY OWNERS Site GO WESTY,  I have used them before &amp; 
WILL AGAIN.(I have NO CONNECTION
to this co, JUST A &quot;HAPPY CAMPER')
AS to other dealings,maybe I&quot;ve been
lucky!!
