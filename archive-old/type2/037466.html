Subject: couple of Time-serts needed (Boston)...

I'm looking for 2 time-serts in Boston area.  I've got
2 helicoils I'd like to replace with Time-serts.  Has
anyone tried this before?  I'm hoping the hole will
have enough to rethread even though the helicoils
seemed pretty large diameter (plug was very loose).

None of the shops I've been to have them, I will order
from Nevada as a last resort.

Thank You,
Shawn
