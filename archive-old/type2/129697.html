&gt;Last night I used a voltmeter on my oxygen sensor and it indeed seemed 
&gt;to indicate that I was running lean both at idle and at 3000 RPM. They
&gt;both ran approximately 100 to 400 millivolts, but its kinda hard to say
&gt;for sure with the meter I used (Fluke model 77) because the reading
&gt;oscillates back and forth and it did not have the min/max/average
&gt;feature.

That voltage range is right around stoichiometric. Every though the values are on the rich side of the curve because of the hysteresis function, any reading between 80-800mV is basically 14.7:1.

&gt;Once I've determined with certainty that the oxygen sensor is
&gt;responding as rapidly as it should, I will attempt to set the air-fuel
&gt;ratio by adjusting ECU spring tension.

The Bentley says to set the AFR with the O2 sensor disconnected. It doesn't sound like you are going to follow that advice.

&gt;   In case anyone hasn't been following my ongoing saga all summer, I am
&gt;doing all this in an attempt to figure out why I have been burning
&gt;exhaust valves every 6k miles or so.

Have you ruled out a vacuum leak at the injector seals and have you tested the injectors? What if you have a clogged injector and that's causing the cylinder to run too lean?
