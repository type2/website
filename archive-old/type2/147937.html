Subject: Re: Aftermarket Oil thermostat/oil coolers - Long

Heather,

I would be trying to find out why your oil temperatures are so high under 
mild temperature and speed conditions before I would worry about the 
thermostat. Have you checked that you are not running too lean and the 
timing is correct?

Cheers,

Martin.
