        I always thought 8.5:1 to be the upper limit for regular, at least
that's what I've read in many &quot;hot rod&quot; books and articles. Also, you might
check the page that George sent the other day for the Subaru trade, they're
saying that 8.7:1 runs okay with 87 octane.
         That's good to know about adding resistance to the temp sender,
although the oxy sender would probably be a better way to go if that works.
I'm not too sure it works the same way -- but the later Bosch FI stuff
definitely compensates very well automagically. But then you'd need the whole
ECU, harness, etc.
