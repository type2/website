Subject: RE: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)

&gt; Geez, I thought *my* FLAPS sucked! Yer bein' had!
&gt; Bus Depot sells German for $39.95, Brazillian for
&gt; $11.95 (these are for the front...rear are cheaper, I
&gt; think). My local FLAPS is about $6.00 higher on both

&gt; Bus-Depots OR brand has _traditionally_ been brazillian
&gt; BUT: I called busdepot to check on availability of brazilian... I asked
&gt; specifically if their OR part was brazillian or taiwaneese.  They said
&gt; they would have to call their supplier to find out for sure
&gt; (ron?? you always seem to know the scoop on this stuff...)

&gt; I just got an order delivered from Bus Depot for my 67. I ordered 2 left
&gt; fronts, 2 right fronts, and 2 rears.  Both left fronts and both rear were
&gt; Brazilian. Both right fronts are from China.


Okay, here's the deal.  Generally my &quot;OR&quot; brand on pre-'71 wheel cylinders
has been Varga (Brazil), which is a pretty good product.  However, Varga was
recently sold so availability is temporarily spotty until the new owners
settle in.  I deal with about half a dozen Varga distributors every day, so
I always try to get Varga when it's available. Second choices are either
Taiwanese (same as Chinese; remember, Taiwan is now a Chinese territory
again) or Indian.  Frankly I have not had any problem with either, and even
have one or two customers who prefer the Indian ones over the Vargas.  My
failure rate on wheel cylinders has been less than 1/5 of 1% for all brands
combined, over a 2 year period, so reliability has not generally been a
problem with any brand.  At the moment, rears are readily available in
Varga.  In fronts, I can sometimes get it, sometimes not. As someone noted,
I can also ship original-equipment ATE for about $39 each, although given
the low failure rate I've seen on wheel cylinders as a whole, I can't say
that I'd neccessarily pay that much extra for them on my bus.  Remember, the
website order form has a comments section.  You can always specify a brand
preference, such as &quot;ship ATE if no Varga available&quot; or &quot;delete item if no
Varga available,&quot; or whatever.  Not that I'd worry about the brand that much
if I were you.

'71-up rear wheel cylinders are different story, as there are great bargains
to be had at the moment.  My &quot;OR&quot; is actually European made LPR Hydraulics,
for only $9.95, which is a great deal on an excellent product.  I also have
German ATE for $19.95, to be replaced (in about 2 months) by German Febi for
a few bucks less.  Unfortunately neither Febi nor LPR is currently making
pre-71 wheel cylinders.
