&gt; I'm getting ready to install a donated FI engine (from a 78) into my 79, and
&gt; of course I have a few questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, the engine sits on my shop floor, pretty much the way it was given to me, still
&gt; has all of the tins and such bolted on.  Do I need to remove these before I install the engine?  When I removed the previous (non-FI) engine, I pulled the rear tins (per Bentley) but I'd rather not do that again if I can avoid it.

yes, you need to remove the rear tin, the coil, oil filler, and auto
tranny fill, (assuming you have an auto tranny)

&gt; Also, any sugestions on how to best jack the bus up?  I used the engine as a jack-point last time, but of course the engine isn't there now.

never use the engine as a jack point.._dot_use the jack points or some other
frame member,  I like to use the torsion tubes, especially good place to
put the jack stands too
