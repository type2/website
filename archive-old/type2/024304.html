Subject: a new AFM and still missing
Message-ID: &lt;7k2j5f$52c6_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

HI folks

I've been browsing you archives and I've found a lot of references to a problem of erractic shuddering or missing while at cruising speed in buses like my 78 2l FI kombi.

I had already been advised that the problem might have been an intermittent fault in the AFM, and as we are heading off on a big desert trip in a few weeks, I shelled out for a new AFM.

But, the problem is still there.

Any suggestions about where I should look next 

thanks heaps

John
