Subject: Fixing Gasoline Smell, Gas Resistant RTV?

I've got a problem with my 80 Westie where I smell gas
for 20 miles after a fill up.  This is happening even
though I changed all the grommets, hoses, and a
cracked fuel sender about 8 years ago.  The problem
started reappearing a few years ago, so I probably
only got 5 years on the new grommets.  Usually German
rubber lasts longer than 5 years!

I did the pressure test described in Bentley.  It was
leaking air so rapidly, it didn't come close to
passing this leak down test, which looks like a good
diagnostic test for gasoline fumes.

I wanted to see what was actually leaking this time,
so I hooked the appropriate charcoal canister hose up
to an inflated tire via a valve that was just barely
opened so as not to build up too much pressure in the
tank.  The inflated tire gave me the ten minutes or so
to check for the leak  Notice if you try this, do not
use any electric pumps that generate sparks, since you
will have gas fumes floating around.  By squirting a
bubbly type cleaner on the fittings, and using a
mirror, I found the leak. The single grommet on the
left side is leaking where the plastic Y goes through
the grommet.
  
As I recall from last time, this is a tight fitting Y
that would rather break than come out of the grommet. 
Yet it has to come out before the tank can be dropped.
It seems a real waste of time and effort to drop this
tank every time one of these grommets and plastic Ys
start leaking.  Particularly when they are not that
old.  

CALLING ALL LIST MEMBERS:  What type of caulking (like
RTV) sticks like crazy to plastic and rubber, would
seal this junction yet remain plyable, and wouldn't
dissolve away from the gasoline fumes?
