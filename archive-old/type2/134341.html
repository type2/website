Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

Thanks, Volks. Alice has been moved, and I will officially begin reclaiming
my garage this evening. Junk goes out, unwanted stuff sells, shelves go up,
organization happens, my old Falcon and my motorcycle go in, and the whole
thing becomes a proper workspace again for the first time in a year and a
half ... and just in time for winter.

&gt; &gt;  What are the risks of not
&gt; &gt; drying it thoroughly and hooking it up long enough
&gt; &gt; to move it from my
&gt; &gt; driveway to the curb across the street? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; For that short of time, just move it without the
&gt; filter in place (just make sure there is nothing
&gt; flying around loose in the engine compartment that
&gt; could theoretically get sucked down in there. NOT
&gt; LIKELY in such a short time, but possible.)
