My name has become synonymous Safe-Lite :)

It is true that I had nothing but trouble with a local Safelite shop. 
It took them three times to get my windshield in correctly. You can 
check the archives to get all the gory details.

It has been almost two years since that occurred and I can happily 
report that my windshield has held up well and does not leak!

If you choose to do business with them I recommend the following 
based on 1999 prices.

Provide you own seal. I got mine at BusDepot for 17.95. It had a West 
Coast Metric sticker on it and was of good quality. Safelite wanted 
$59.00 for there seal but agreed to use mine for their install.

When you call tell them it is for a VW transporter. They will become 
confused and ask if you mean VW ambulance. Let it slide and say, 
&quot;Yes, that will work fine. &quot; Price of glass only was $69.00.

They charged about a $39  installation fee. ( All subsequent installs 
were free until they got it right:)

Prices may have changed.

Good luck and happy windshielding!
