Subject: Re: [T2] That part I need...

&gt; I'm looking for the part that might be called something like a &quot;positve vacuum valve&quot;. I can't get the
correct name. It feeds to the fuel regulator, or in other words, the fuel regulator can't function without
this part. What is happening since the fuel retgulator can't work is that my left over fuel is not sent back
to the gas tank. Instead it goes out my tailpipe as dark fumes, thereby using up more gas than I need to.

 Does anyone know the correct name of this and does anyone have one for sale?

I am assuming this is for the 76 Kombi, and not the 75 bug?

If yes, on the L Jetronic system, there is no such thing. Sounds like you have a bad fuel pressure regulator.
It controls the return to the tanks. If the diapraghm ruptures, raw fuel will be sucked into the engine. Here
is your FI fuel rail:

#3 is the pressure regulator.
