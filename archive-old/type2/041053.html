Hey Collie --

There may be a 1972-3 candidate for you in a boneyard near Easton,
Maryland.  Guy who runs the place is quite reasonable.  Where are you
located?

I am looking for the roof clip off a bay window sunroof bus...does
anybody
on the list have any idea where I can buy the roof clip or of a
junkyard on
the east coast (preferably) where there is a junk sunroof bus with
working
sunroof...
