Subject: Re: [T2] Bad engine noises!!!

&gt; &gt; I'm guessing obviously that one of my lifters
&gt; &gt; wasn't getting oil. I checked my oil on the
&gt; dipstick and it's still VERY
&gt; &gt; clean. Could this be a symptom of a clogged oil
&gt; filter maybe?

Don't hold me to this but I was reading a research
report that tested different brands of oil filters.
Some filters, such as Fram, are so cheeply made that
they can cause engine noise. I bought Mahle oil
filters from the bus depot. They are suppose to be
good but I have not taken a road test yet. I wish I
could find the link to that study. They say that
Puralator (sp) filters are very good. I do agree that
what you are hearing is pretty normal though. Good
luck and take care!
