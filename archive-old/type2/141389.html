Subject: Re: [T2] new cip1 1600 longblock

&gt; I believe the entire engine is made in Brazil, the &quot;Volkswagen do Brasil
Ltda&quot; is very distinct on the outside of the box.....Nothing about Mexico.
&gt; Armed w the helpful replies, tomorrow I'll look it over and try to
determine if is duel relief and try to answer the questions posed in the
replies.
&gt;
&gt; Duel relief seems to be the only issue????
&gt; No one has mentioned other Mexican/Brazilian quality differences???

Look for the original factory part number for the engine, either on the box
or on a tag on the engine.  The number quoted on the Cip1 site is not a
proper VW Brazil number.  Most likely it would be something like
040.100.032.15.

There is no real difference in build quality etc, between the Mexican and
Brazilian engines.  However, the specs are different.  Aside from the single
relief, they have different heads (one less fin) and cylinders (one more
fin), so replacement parts (in this respect) would be difficult.
