Subject: [T2] Backfiring mystery..

Hello everybody, I have a 68 Westy and she is backfiring out the tailpipe.It only happens when I let off the gas, and it's a small backfire
with a little flame. I recently replaced the carb with a brand new 30/31 Pict, and I adjusted it at school on a 4-gas  machine and she ran
good. At the same time I did the points and timing and valves and that's when the little backfire occured.The old carb was leaking fuel but
the bus did not backfire.I'm more than 99 percent sure I did all my tune-up to spec, because I've done it many times.I know I couldn't of
developed and exhaust leak during this time, so I'm not sure where to start looking.
Any info will help.
Thanks,
Casey
