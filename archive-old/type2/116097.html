You would think so after building busses for 30+ years with that shift rod
design. The entire design is a house of cards and failure of any one item
ruins the shifter feel or the ability to shift. Let's see:

- front bushing gets cut by frame and falls off
- nylon shift bushings break or deform
- rubber pieces in coupler wear out
- the brass bushings wear the hockey stick!
- plastic! ball inside nose cone breaks

Don't get me started on the engine/trans drop required to get the work done.
On top of that, there's an Oct 77 factory bulletin recommending a third
bushing be retrofitted to earlier busses to improve shifter feel.

The worst part is that the majority of original parts are NLA and the
aftermarket stuff is poor quality.
