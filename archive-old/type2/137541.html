&quot;As far&quot; I might agree with simply because there is not as much &quot;space&quot; 
over there.  As fast?  We're talking about Europe, right??  I lived there 
in the mid-eighties and I routinely saw Euro-spec Vanagons going 90-100mph 
and baywindow busses going 80+ (admittedly not on the hills).  In Germany, 
the vehicles are designed with the assumption that they may be driven 
flat-out on the autobahn for hours at a time.  My '73 bus was designed and 
built in the land of no speed limits and with proper cooling and 
lubrication of the engine I do not feel that running 4400rpm (75mph) on the 
freeway is a problem.  The main reason I drive 55-60 in my bus is because 
of mileage, which drops off drastically at the higher speeds
