Subject: Junk yard find.

While cruising a local junkyard in search of a lower left engine tin piece 
for my '77 westy (I meant lower right tin,  This is the tin that bridges the
gap from the case to the heat exchanger and it covers the thermostat.  Every
bus I looked at has it removed, someone must take it off to get to the
thermostat and not bother to put it back on.  I still haven't found one yet
so if anyone can help I will certainly be interested.)  I stumbled accross
the FI system out of an '80 vanagon.  I grabbed all of the pieces that looked
familiar (4 injectors, fuel pressure regulator, that box with the waffle grid,
the black sheet metal distributor thingy all of the wires and the computer).
I was interested in some spare parts since one injector cost me $57 new
a month ago.  I got everything for $50!!!  Now with my luck everything will
be fried.  I am not sure how much will fit my '77 although I am sure the
injectors will.  I just want the security of having spare FI parts around
since this is main part of my bus that I don't understand or completely
trust.  
        Anyone know what the little high low switch located near the
FI computer of a '77 bus is for?
Thanks,
Brett
