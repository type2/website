&gt; we paint tin? I've always been told Rustoleum, maybe the high-heat kind.
&gt; Presumably this is a dumb question, but I guess the underside will rust if
&gt; it's wet.

Any paint will work fine as the temps aren't all that high.  The prep is
the important thing.  And yes, it will rust if you don't paint it.
Heat+moisture=corrosion!
