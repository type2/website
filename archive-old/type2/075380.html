Subject: 79 California FI acting up

My fuel injection system is working. The bus is running, but I have to 
feather the accelerator to keep it running at idle. This is a pain. I am also 
losing power badly on small hills and have to downshift frequently. 

So, I have exhausted my knowledge. All cylinders are firing. All injectors 
are working right. The timing is right. When I try to adjust the idle it 
seems to do NOTHING at all. How many TURNS to make the idle pitch change? 

Anyway, I am about to throw in the towel. I was fixing a cold-running problem 
by replacing the cold-start air valve. It helped, but I still could not hold 
an idle when cold. But, after that, I could not hold an idle when WARM 
either...

Aggravating. Any ideas? Better, anybody know a mechanic in or near North 
Wales, PA that can help? Sheesh.
