&gt; &quot;new&quot; range (.003-.005 inch)  The wear limit is .006 inch.  Do not accept
&gt; an engine with an end play greater than .005.  Even if you have to walk
&gt; for a few days, it isn't worth it to install a junk engine.

Can also be done using threaded stock, a few bolts, a large washer (or other stiff
metal piece with a hole in it) and a feeler guage.


&gt; Nope, it's impossible to do the other way round.  Well, not impossible,
&gt; but pretty difficult.  You leave off the rear and side cover plates, as
&gt; well as the oil filler, until the engine is in

as well as the coil
