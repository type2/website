&gt; &gt; I just obtained 4 Bus or Vanagon driveaway side tents from a

then andy replyed:
&gt; That looks very similar to the Andria tent that Steve Lashley is

Tents, tents and more tents. I was talking about this off-list.
Everyone and their uncle is looking for a side tent, and we all want
them cheap.

The last 2 &quot;vintage&quot; baywindow tents sold for $430 and $435 on
ebay&lt;f&gt;. These are better prices compared to what I've seen in the
past. No one really wants to spend $600-1000 dollars on something
they'll only use a few times a year. I don't see the point in setting
up a tent if I'm not staying somewhere for at least a couple of
nights. Still kicking myself for passing on a $300 tent that was
offered to me last year. It had a small rip, and I really didn't know
what they were worth then. Most of us don't want a musuem peice, just
a good, cheap, usable tent.

The &quot;new&quot; bus tents are a cool alternative. Lightweight fabric and
poles for cheaper then what the vintage tents go for. Great. 'Cause
of the lightweight, shipping is cheaper. But they don't come with a
floor. The floor will cost you extra (sleeping cabin $100) , BUT, for
the money you get a brand new tent. Even with the extra cost of the
floor, it'll cost about the same (or less) then a vintage tent.

Both the vintage and new tents hook up to a bus, and work well to
keep the rain off of you, or provide shade in the sun. A cheap blue
tarp and poles will work too. Just hafta decide how much you want to
spend to acheive the desired results.

Vintage tents get a plus for looks. The colors of the new tents stink
IMHO. Big blue tarps are cheap.

And don't forget to consider awnings too :^)
