Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust / high temp painting

Dave- Would you mind posting the specific brands, and sources
( manufacturer / supplier ) and the colors and inventory numbers
of the hi-temperature powdercoat materials you have been using?
There are so many products which fail in actual use.
Thanx,
Dave \X/ ( *coming out of lurk mode soon:)

&gt; I have had(so far) excellent results from the hi temperature powder coat
&gt; paints that I have used.  Not too many miles on them(1500), but they still
&gt; look like they day I painted them....even on the exhaust pipes next to the
&gt; heads....and this is a after two 4 hour runs in 85+ weather on the
&gt; interstate at 75+mph.
