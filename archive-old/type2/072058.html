Dave,

If you can get the Brazilian panels, I would say go for it.  I got a pair
of Brazilian front wheel arches (doglegs) in '97.  They are well made and
fit perfectly, unlike the Veng version that I bought first and had to send
back because they were so poorly made, with ripples everywhere and ragged
edges.  It may be that the company that bought Veng are doing a better job,
but I doubt it if they are using the same tooling and selling for the same
price.
The panels that Schofield makes are also very good, but I think he tends to
make small repair sections and parts that are not available from VW.
I can't comment on the parentage of the Just Kampers panels.
