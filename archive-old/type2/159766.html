Subject: leaky propane tank safety valve/guage

Hey Everyone,
I have a 78 Westy with a propane tank.  I have a main valve, safety 
valve thing (w/ pressure gauge), and then the regulator.  The way I turn 
the gas on is by opening the main valve and then press down on the 
safety valve.  The gauge goes up to whatever level the tank is filled to 
and pressure is held in the system.  I think the safety valve's purpose 
is to ensure that there is not a wide-open leak as that will cause the 
valve to close if pressure is not held in the system.

Recently, however, my safety valve has started leaking around the place 
where it slides in and out whenever I press it down.  I can jostle it 
around and eventually it stops leaking, but I figure it's probably best 
to replace it.

Does anyone know where I can get a new one?

Thanks!
Mike
