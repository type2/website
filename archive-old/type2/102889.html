&lt;&lt; I know, I know the list goes round and round on Bus Depot's service and 
quality but where else can you talk to the owner of the business if things 
go afoul?

There is also www.aircooled_dot_net , and a few others on the list. I would 
seriously try to do business with someone on the list.

FWIW.

Trust me (!)...We've all the same problem here...Aging vehicles (and
owners) and a mother co. not exactly on our side...Try the list ven-
dors first, even if the price isn't the lowest of all, if we don't sup-
port 'em, they go and then who ya gonna call...?-(
