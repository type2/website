Subject: Carlisle PA Campout

Hey Volks...

There is a VDub winter campout the last weekend of February in the
Carlisle PA area.  I'm not organizing it but a small cadre from N. VA
will be attending.  So if anyone else in the area (Steve....Sean....John
Anderson....Barry....Tom F.....other vdubbers) wants to head up there
with us, drop me an email. We're leaving after work on Friday, Feb 26th.
Here are more details from Drew (allwein_at_lmf_dot_net)...the organizer:

Drew here...  What a happy piece of news you've sent me!
We're up to 16 or 18 people and at least 12 busses.  Thanks for
spreading
the word.
    
Since you seem to know that it's at Carlisle, I'm going to presume that
you know the rest of the vitals...  If you need detailed info:  Date-
February 26, 27, 28
&gt;                     Location- Mountain Creek Campground;  near Carlisle,
&gt;Pa;
O.k., lets try that address again; this one will work:

I'm looking forward to meeting you and your crew, Bob.  Tell them a
tye-dye and vegggie-burger vendor will be attending... Less food and
clothing to pack.  I'll update everyone a week before the event.  Take
care.
                                                                ~Drew
