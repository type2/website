&gt; Also, my heater boxes are thrashed, so I want some suggestions.  The
&gt; cheapest I have found them is for roughly $200 a piece, but I am not
&gt; really in a position to buy them right now.  If someone knows a cheaper
&gt; place to find them, that would be great


I have a handful of original N.O.S. German right side ones left for $149
each. Real German boxes have not been available for years at any price.
(Have Lefts for $189 in Danish.)
