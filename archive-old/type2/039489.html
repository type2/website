Subject: another Old Volks Home

***not much bus content, just another VW shop with the name***

there's an Old Volks Home in St. Paul, Minnesota. I found it in the yellow
pages when I was on my way to Alaska in 1995 in my '88 Golf. the front end
felt sketchy. Arriving at the Old Volks Home there were lots of bugs
and buses in the yard and in the shop, I knew I was in the right
place.  DAVE, the owner/proprietor, immediately pulled my car into
the service bay, pumped the CVs full of grease, gave me a spare, fixed the
ground on my FI, test drove it, bought my friend a cup of coffee and a
donut (friend was surprised to wake up in the passenger seat with a
stranger driving), and charged us a grand total of $12.  

The DAY AFTER arriving at safe haven in Alaska, the left outboard CV joint
failed leaving us stranded in a good place. Coincedentally Dave visited
Alaska in a cherry Vanagon Westy and later sent me (free of charge) a
Bentley shop manual for the Golf. as a result, I fixed that CV, work on
the car myself ever since, bought my first bus, am competent to fix and
drive it too, and just saved another bus from the scrap yard. Thanks Dave!

VW karma is real.
