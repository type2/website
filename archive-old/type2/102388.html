Subject: '79 CA bus dead at the side of the road.

I need some analysis/advice regarding the failure of my '79 CA bus, fuel
injected with O2 sensor.

My '79 bus sputtered and died at the side of the freeway a week ago. I had
AAA tow it home which was only a few miles away. After half a day of trouble
shooting electrical stuff etc. I did a compression check, #3 and #4 had zero
compression. This is a completely rebuilt engine with less than 10000 miles
on it. I had the bus towed to my local VW folks for a tear down.

Here are the pre-failure symptoms.
1) After a day at the park and ride, I started the bus and it backfired and
blew the hose off the decel valve.
2) Same thing above happened the evening of the fatal drive.
3) Bus had a ticking sound on the fatal drive, hmm I thought maybe one of
the hydraulic lifters wasn't pumping up.
4) Bus sputtered once as I got on the freeway.
5) 2 miles later the bus went dead and I coasted to the shoulder. No
expensive sounds were made, but the bus would not start again.

Results of the tear down at the VW shop.
1) Dropped valve seats on 3&amp;4 head
2) They said that one of the air intake boots had slipped off and I was
getting unmeasured air into the system, causing the bus to run lean and hot.
3) Didn't I notice that it was running hot or rough? Err, well it ran about
220F on the freeway, and the only hint that things were rough was the
startup backfire and the stutter before it died.

So, was 220F too hot (oil temp measured with a sump sender)? Did this heat
cause the dropped valve seat or did I have a low quality head on there from
the rebuild?
