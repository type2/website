&gt; &gt;  I said in the earlier post that the parts amounted to about the same
&gt; &gt; weight/size class.  Its primarily a function of distance.  Socal is
&gt; farther
&gt; &gt; than Bus Depot and that saves money for Midwesten bus fanatics.  As
&gt; far as
&gt; &gt; time for shippment goes.  SoCal &quot;forgot&quot; to tell me that half of my
&gt; order
&gt; &gt; was backordered.  ...

Here's my quick weigh in.
I just placed two orders last week with Bus Depot and in both cases the
service was prompt and I could have not asked for better.  I went cross
country for my parts and SoCal is literally walking distance (albiet an
exercise walk of 2 miles) down the street from me.  I drive by their place on
a weekly basis while out conducting business.

I think you could say that Bus Depot saves money for all us bus fanatics.

   Passing Thought -
        Don't bite the hand that..........looks dirty.
        No news is........................impossible.
        You can't teach an old dog........math.
        If you lie down with dogs, you....will stink in the morning.
        Love all, trust...................me.
        The pen is mightier than..........the pigs.
        An idle mind is...................the best way to relax.
        A penny saved is..................not much.
        If at first you don't succeed.....get new batteries.
        When the blind lead the blind.....get out of the way.
