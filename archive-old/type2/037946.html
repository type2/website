Subject: Re: October 71 Bus - front emblem clips

Ok..here's what i did for my emblem.
Don't mess around going to hardware stores or anything like that.  Go to your
local auto body place.  They should have them.  Even the crappy one in the
town I used to live in had them.  the little rubber &quot;clips&quot; are about $.25 a
piece.  They were used on a lot of older autos.
