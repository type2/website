Subject: Re: [T2] Painting the bus myself...

H Steven Dolan sends:

&gt; Let me (and the list) know if you find anything.  I know that some
&gt; manufacturers are using water-based systems in their factories, but AFAIK,
&gt; all aftermarket paint is still solvent-base of one sort or another, usally
&gt; a very explosive 'nother.
&gt; 
&gt;                          Steve Dolan

Let's see...
Tried DuPont, no dice. They probably have a waterborne system they sell to
GM, but we aren't GM.

Sikkens only has the waterborne primer, no waterborne topcoats. This is
strange; with the environmental consciousness of Europeans, you'd think
they'd be first in line with one.

Same deal with PPG. I did find the PPG SX1060 primer-surfacer, which is
specifically designed to be applied with a roller.

And Sherwin-Williams--waterborne primer, also waterborne sealer, no
waterborne topcoat. (Fun direction in their waterborne primer TDS: &quot;Store in
sealed, lined, airtight cans to prevent mold growth.&quot; Mold on car paint?)

The Glasurit 90-line (for cars) and 66-line (for trucks) are waterborne
topcoat systems sold to refinishers. I will be damned if I can find out
what's in it, though. (Guess I have to call the Glasurit dealer in town and
ask if they have the technical data sheet for 90-line. Unlike Sikkens,
Glasurit doesn't put their TDS on the internet. Fortunately, the DuPont, the
Glasurit and the Sikkens dealers are all close to my shop--the Glasurit
guy's a block away, the Sikkens guy is a mile and a quarter and the DuPont
guy is in our building. Lessee...a printing plant and an autobody supply
store in the same building; anyone want to guess what our fire insurance
premiums look like?)

OTOH, on the side of the Sikkens can are all sorts of fun fire warnings.
They should just write &quot;this is a bomb&quot; on the front of the can and be done
with it.
