Subject: raw fuel in exhaust

My buddy is having some raw fuel come out of his exhuast pipe. He hasn't =
seen it, but can smell it a lot.=20

I imagine its not firing on 1 or more of the cylinders. What do we do to =
test it, besides checking the spark plug for a spark? Could there be a =
leak or something?

Thanks,
Rob Henley
