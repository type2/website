On my 71 you need to open the door to lock or release the two clasps that 
lock the rear seat.  I imagine they are required if you have passengers 
using rear seat belts even though the clasps are pretty light weight.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...  We then took that little useless flip-down door on the front of
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bench seat cabinet (under the seats) and put it in the garage 
&gt;rafters.
&gt; &gt; &gt;We
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then secured the wood to the front of the bench cabinet with one 
&gt;screw
&gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top centre so that the speaker magnets poked into the door 
&gt;opening
&gt; &gt; &gt;(but did not take up any space in the storage space)....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What a good idea. That little drawer is truly useless, since one flips 
&gt;up
&gt; &gt; &gt;the seat to get anything out of there anyways.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What a very good idea. You rock, sir.
