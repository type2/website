&gt; &gt; I just returned from the garage and hada look at the head in question. The
&gt; &gt; intake vlave seat on number was not dropped or dislodged by pushed
&gt; &gt; in a fraction. There was exhaust etc from where the head was not meeting
&gt; &gt; the cylinder. Any one familiar with this one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This problem sounds like failure due to pre-ignition (knocking, pinging,
&gt; etc.). 

Detonation -- cheap fuel and to much timing!


&gt; Also check for damage on the piston crown.  VW buses have their
&gt; engines rather far from the ears of their drivers, pull large loads with
&gt; itty-bitty engines, heat up alot, etc. alltogether a bad mixture for this.
&gt; The pinging occurs when the mixture explodes rather than burns.  It sounds
&gt; like a rather tinkly rattling under load (like going up hills).  If you
&gt; don't stop what you're doing (downshift, take the foot off the gas) you
&gt; continue to hammer the inside of the engine.  On most engines, the piston
&gt; crown, being aluminum is the weak point, and you blow a hole in the piston.
&gt; Veedubs break in other formats, including driving a valve through the head.
&gt;


Check your ring side clearance. If it is excessive your got detonation.

If your ring lands are good, it could be as simple as loose head bolts!

&gt; Good luck -- I hope I'm wrong, and am not expert on this...
