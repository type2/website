&gt;Err, of course the fuse doesn't matter ... since the ignition switch is

Correct. For reference Bentley goofed ont he fuse box diagram and corrected it:

&gt;In any case... I went out and checked both sides of S8 and S9 with the 
&gt;VOM ... no voltage.
&gt;
&gt;Now I'm beginning to wonder if something truly scary like &quot;nut came 
&gt;loose and fell off leaving + from battery dangling around underneath 
&gt;the bus&quot; has happened.  Or maybe something equally annoying, but a lot 
&gt;less scary, like &quot;wire that connects ignition switch to terminal 30 on 
&gt;solenoid is dangling around underneath the bus&quot;.  (Either way I'm going 
&gt;to have to push the damned thing away from the curb to look, grumble.)
&gt;
&gt;Geez, and the loose wire theory might explain the initial &quot;when revved&quot; 
&gt;behavior, too.

Undo and rebolt the battery ground strap to the body. Check the transmission ground strap as well.
