Subject: kicked the &quot;won't idle cold&quot; but have tiny oil leak I'd like to
  fix???

Hi,

Well I've finally kicked all the little troubles I've had with my
'80.....my &quot;won't idle cold&quot;.... a temp sensor, aux air valve and
rubber &quot;Y&quot; between decelerator and plenum and things are much
better.  The rubber &quot;Y&quot; was the killer but looking for it I found the
other two which weren't keeping me from running but would have
eventually.

So after a installing a new exhaust this past summer and dropping the
heater boxes and installing new exhaust gaskets and then doing an oil
change I'm noticing a small drip of an oil leak on the drivers side just 
forward of the oil filter.  Its probably been doing this for a while but 
now that things are running good I'm tweaking little stuff.

I'm guessing this is coming from the oil cooler or nearby.  Any likely
places I can tighten a nut to see if I can stop the drip?
BTW, I have no tin-ware between my driver's side heater box and
anything else like there is on the passenger side heater box.  Is
there supposed to be?  (I'm guessing it would hide my leak but I'd
rather stop it anyway.)


Sincerely,
--
