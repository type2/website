Subject: So what gives?

What's up, I am new to the list, and new to the type 2 gig.I just bought my 
buddies cherry 68 westy and I was wondering what is the difference between 
the campmobile and westfalia?The sink/icebox says campmobile on the side but 
I also have a few metal plates that say westfalia.

Thanks,
Casey

1968 Westy
