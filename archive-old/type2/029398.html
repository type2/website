&gt; Bumper mounts have to be solid so as not to allow excess weight being placed

The only hitches that are capable of moving load onto the front wheels of
the vehicle are equalizing-type hitches.  These use spring bars to impart
a moment to the vehicle pushing the front wheels downward.  You can see
these hitches on large travel trailers (go to an Airstream gathering).

Without an equalizing hitch, it doesn't matter if the hitch is mounted to
the bumper, torsion housing, or any other part of the bus.  The tongue
weight of the trailer will add load to the rear wheels and remove a bit of
load from the front.

Bus hitches generally extend forward to the torsion housing to transfer
the pull-push load to this strong part of the chassis and to prevent
twisting loads on the bumper. The vertical tongue weight
is almost always carried by the bumper or by hitch structure that ties to
the body near the bumper mounts.
