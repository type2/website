I am having big issues with this fuel injection thing, next step put on 
carbs.  the engine is flooding and will not fire, then I disconnect the plug 
on the throttle control unit (I think) the unit connected to the air filter 
box, then it will fire but will still not run! Does anyone have any ideas?  
If the unit is bad I will be needing one.  so if any are for sale?
thanks again,
         Larry
