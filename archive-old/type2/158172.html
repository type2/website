And if you own a certain LBC (Little British Car... ;-), you can never
watch &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;...(Just another reason to hate SUV's... ;-(
(Altho' truth be told, the car wasn't really crushed...It was positioned
on a hydraulic sled that lowered it under the SUV...It's still around and
running quite well, thank you very much... ;-)
