&gt; Subject: what engine
&gt;
&gt; We have a 1971 bus that needs a new engine, we want to buy a long block but
&gt; who is a good builder. Has anyone had any experience with putiing in a larger
&gt; pumped up engine. California Imoprts has some engines by SIR international
&gt; ranging from 1641cc to 2110, now the 2110 is to much money but something
&gt; inbetween would do. any ideas thanks
&gt;

First thing is to make sure you don't get a Bug engine with no provision for
mounting the rear engine carrier.

Second, in my opinion, is to steer away from thin walled cylinders which makes for
a hotter running engine.  My personal preference for a Bus would be thick walled
88s and either a 74 or 78 crank which works out to 1800 and 1900 respectively.  Or
if you go with a stock crank the size with those P/Cs is 1681.  The thick walled
88s are a bit of an oddity in the pre-built engine world.  Resist the sales
people's attempts to sell you on slip in 88s or larger P/Cs, which are all thin
walled.
