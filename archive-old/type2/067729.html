This reminds me - last week as I was sitting in a Goodyear shop waiting
for new tires for my Jetta - I was paging through &quot;Trailer Life&quot; or some
such wonderful Americana dreaming magazine. I happened to notice an ad
for Sportsmobile Camper conversions. They were advertising their new
conversions for full-size American Vans - mini-motor homes - expensive
suckers. But down in the lower left corner of the ad was a picture of a
Splitty camper - a Sportsmobile conversion. The little caption said &quot;Our
first VW bus - 1961). Cute... remembering their heritage.. I don't know
if it was a fond remembrance or a &quot;You've come a long way baby!&quot; But now
I know when the first Sportsmobile conversion was done. Sorry, I don't
know the date of the magazine - but should be readily available in some
such mags..
