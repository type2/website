&gt;   I imagine that there will be fierce bribing for
&gt; votes for the various BNNTA Bus Awards, especially in the hotly contested Best
&gt; Group Theme Camping awards.  It'll be fun to see what your campsites will be
&gt; decorated as...

That was the part of the camp that impressed me the most !  I love to be bribed!
some folks used alcohol.. some used food.. and everyone used good fun!

It is a great way to get folks to mingle and introduce themselves,, and shoot
the breeze!

I know you'll have fun!

oh,, The website says 20th BNNTA... so I assume the subject line is a typo...
