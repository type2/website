&gt; &gt;Another neat trick if you've got little bitty holes in your window
frames:
&gt; &gt;grind the metal nice and shiny, use a centerpunch to kinda roll in the
hole
&gt; &gt;just enough to fit a 1/8&quot; mild steel welding rod in it (it should take a
&gt; &gt;little doing to get the rod in; that way you know you have a good close
fit)
&gt; &gt;then weld it in with MIG wire. Use your angle grinder to smooth it up and
&gt; &gt;you're done.
&gt;
&gt; Not to knock you guys who are talented enough to gas weld but another
&gt; neat trick is to just MIG it.  A neat trick for that BTW in this
circumstance
&gt; is to back up the area to be welded if you can with a piece of copper, I
have
&gt; several pieces of 1/4&quot;x1&quot; copper bar stock bent into various shapes of
many
&gt; lengths to reach up behind and back up areas to repair pinholes.
&gt;
&gt; Whoever mentioned the flapper discs though, those things are another
&gt; relatively recent and outstanding innovation.  Has anybody tried the
Harbor
&gt; Freight ones at 3 for $9.99 as paying $6.50 each locally is getting a bit
&gt; old.
