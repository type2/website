Subject: Head replacement

I am getting ready to swap heads.  (exhaust stud keeps pulling out)  Plus I
need to install my dual solex and some other maintenance before I head on to
Bonnaroo.  (got me tix yesterday  :))

Anyway..  When I pull the heads, are there any gaskets that will need
replacing?  Or are there any at all?  This is on an 1800 engine.  I will be
replacing the heads, and heater box.  And I will be swapping from a weber
:( to a dual solex and the manifold will also be replaced. (Don't ask the
weber is already spoken for as well as the manifold.)

While I am typing this I am thinking I will also need a gasket for the
manifold to the heads.  Am I correct in thinking this???

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
