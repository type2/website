Subject: cheap busses-and general Firday stuff

OK, So I've been watching the thread about the cheap busses and would like to 
put my two cents in. I bought my 1971 camper almost a year ago. It didn't 
run, had a lot of dents and dings, faded, worn paint, but overall a sound 
bus. I paid $350. from friends who had it sitting in their back yard. They 
bought it in 95, blew a valve on the way home from the PO, never titled it or 
paid anymore mind to it. I've done all of the body work myself. Pulling 
dents, and filling dings, I'm in the process of my first engine rebuild, and 
next will learn how to weld so it can have a new battery tray. The paint job 
will have to wait, but Kylon works in the meantime. It's not the prettiest 
bus...but I find myself dreaming about driving it, and I haven't even driven 
it yet.
It takes a lot of time...or money. I haven't got much of the latter, and 
really enjoy getting my hands dirty. But, if you don't have much of either, 
buy the best bus your money will allow. If you don't it will end up an 
unloved neglected bus that has to wait until a friend or passerby sees it in 
you back yard and saves it from you, like I did with my bus.
Lastly, this is not a bus thing, but a VW thing. I need help finding a 
passenger door for my 67 Ghia. I have located a few but they all are $250 or 
more. Unfortunately, no good boneyards nearby. Any of you out there have a 67 
parts car or have a decent boneyard that may be able to help me out?? I don't 
need the glass, handles, hardware, interior panels or any of that...just the 
door. I have a 71 door (will trade if anyone needs it), but it's not 
compatible, 67 is a year only door. Any help is MUCH APPRECIATED!

Thanks, 
Melissa
