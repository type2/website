&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;After nearly 20 years of camping in friends' busses, I bought a really
nice Vanagon Westy this summer.  I LOVE the a/c, REAL heater, and
relatively smooth and powerful ride, but something is missing... (early
warning for impending midlife crisis?)  I know, I know...riding around in
a smelly, slow, funny-looking VW camper won't recapture my youth, but
nonetheless...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Classic case of upcoming VW mania. I would suggest to keep the Vanagon (in a
couple of years it will be a vintage car too) and add a loaf or splitty just
for fun. In winter you will appreciate all the goodies VW threw into the
Vanagon. In summer you can enjoy the sounds of your puttering A/C engine.
Anyway that's what I decided to do. More info and pictures on
