Lauria asks:  Does a '71 bus with a 1600 engine have any towing
capacity?  Stop
laughing! 

Yes...they do.  I have a small trailer made by Reese (called a
&quot;Backpacker&quot;) that I've towed behind both my '69 and '79 Westys.  Works
great for those bulky (yet relatively lightweight) items we take on
camping happenings!
