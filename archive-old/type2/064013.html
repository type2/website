Subject: Back home

I know no-one missed me (well, OK, maybe one person) while I was over
in Kenya checking out buses for 3 weeks, but too bad, 'cause now I'm
back and it's too late (to miss me, that is).

Actually I was visiting my parents, but I kept my eyes peeled,
and there were plenty of VW transporters to be seen!  The basic
automotive rule in Kenya is &quot;Do anything necessary to keep the car on
the road&quot;.

For bay-windows, this often means a hacked conversion to a water
cooled engine, and I'd guess that 1/4 to 1/3 of the bays I saw had big
square grills cut into the nose.  Kenya is a right-hand drive country,
so I sorta felt like I was looking in a mirror the whole time I was
there.  RHD buses, single &amp; double cabs, vanagons, vanagon double
cabs, saw them all.  Very cool.  Kenya is the land of safari, and some
of the VW buses &amp; vans I saw in Nairobi had been converted for that
use.  Mostly, this means a large custom-cut pop-up sunroof for picture
taking and 6 to 8 captain's chairs in the cargo area for comfortable
rhino-chasing.

In Mombasa, I saw a two buses converted for use as Matatus.  A matatu
is a independently owned-and-operated van/truck/bus used for hauling
people (like a city bus, but smaller).  These buses were outfitted
with up to four bench seats (including the front), officially seating
up to 11 or so people, but often carrying many more than that.  You'd
be amazed how many people can fit in an ordinary VW, Nissan, or
Mitsubishi van!!!

One common and quite nifty (IMHO) variation of the baywindow buses
were the ones with sliding rear windows on both sides.  Like the
sliding middle windows of the 78 and 79 buses and vanagons, these
buses had sliders in the rear side windows.  These must have come from
South Africa, as I've never noticed anything like them in the US or
Europe (but if someone knows otherwise, let me know!)  They were NOT
simply an extra set of the middle windows installed in the rear--they
were a distinctly different shape to fit the shape of the window.

My father also told me that one of the first cars I ever rode in was a
brand-spanking-new 1968 RHD baywindow bus when my folks moved to
Nigeria when I was 8 weeks old.  (Yes, that means I'm 28 this year.)
So I guess I've had buses in my blood longer than I thought!  I always
thought I liked them because of the 79 my dad owned and on which I
learned to drive.  But I guess the sound of that air-cooled 4-banger
has been rattling around in my head since I was an infant!  Gotta love
it!

Also, on the way home I had a lay-over in Zurich, and I talked to a
guy there who had been evacuated from the Central African Republic
back in May of this year, due to a coup.  In C.A.R., he had been
driving a 1993 baywindow bus from Brazil.  Yes, it was aircooled!  So,
even if the Mexican factory is cranking out watercooled baywindows,
Brazil is/was-recently still making aircooled versions.

In any case, it's good to be back.  While the VWs were awesome, the
road conditions were terrible.  It's nice to be able to &quot;Drive 55&quot;
without having my teeth rattled out of my head!

Later,
Rodney

P.S.  Before anyone asks, no, I didn't take any bus pictures.
So shoot me.  Maybe I can talk my dad into snapping some before he
moves back to the States next year.
