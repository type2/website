Subject: Re: Wurth site and catalog

Hello Karl,

I've ordered from Wurth USA a few times. The last time it was from the 
Ramsey, NJ (Northeast Distrobution Center) _at_ 800-987-8487 or 201-825-2710.  It was 
fairly easy (I just called) and expensive. Great products though.  Maybe there 
are Canadian Centers as well.  Aerosol shipping might be difficult (I think 
they said ground only for that).  
Good luck, 
Dino Spentzos
Newport, RI

Anyone with experience on ordering? Is it wholesale only?  Do they have 
retail stores or?  I am in Canada so it may be more complicated.
