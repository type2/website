Listees,

The following is in regard to a '73 bus with a 1700 Type 4 engine and a  
Weber DFEV carb.

My bus has been sitting in my garage for some time - haven't had a lot of 
time to work on it.  I occasionally move it out when I need the space to do 
other things.

About a month ago I noticed a large puddle of oil under the bus about 3 days 
since it had last been moved - it appeared to all be coming from the 
cloth-covered hose (not one of the fuel lines - the vent?) attached to the 
fuel pump.

After consulting the archives, I thought I had the &quot;tear in the diaphram&quot; 
problem.  I removed the fuel pump, took it apart and didn't see anything 
wrong with the diaphram - no visible tears, etc.  I tested the pumping 
action using water and it seems to work quite well.

In the weeks and months prior to this event I had trouble starting and 
keeping the bus running.  It idled VERY low - I'm guessing 100-200 rpm - 
this change from normalcy happened all of a sudden, definitely not a gradual 
thing.

When I would rev it, the engine felt VERY unbalanced and rough and from time 
to time I could hear a ticking, metal on metal sound. I checked the 
compression cold and got 135-135-125-125 which ruled out dropped valves or 
other catastrophic damage (Phew!)

The archives also mentioned stuck floats in carbs causing the gas-in-oil 
problem.  I may have this problem given the bad idle, but wouldn't the flow 
of gas stop after the section of gas line between the pump and the carb 
emptied out - or was some sort of siphon created?

Any ideas?

Thanks for your time,

Scott
