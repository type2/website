Subject: VW show in NJ

Saw this announcement in my local paper:
  The NJ VW Club will hold &quot;Summer Splash-8&quot;, its eigth annual VW Car
show + swap meet on Sunday, Aug. 2, in Veterens Park, Berkely Township,
from 9am to 3 pm, rain or shine.(snip...info abt. Bugzilla) Admission is 
$5 for adults, free for kids under 12. There is a playground for kids,
music by a DJ, food vendors and free parking. For car or swap
registration or general info call Tim Semple at 732-840-6371 or Sue
Cangelosi at 732-367-9808.
  Just passing on the info for those in the area....don't blame me if
its chock full of bugs + no busses (I hate when that happens!) or if it 
sucks.  XOXO   Rose (a sniveling lurker no more...)
