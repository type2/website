Subject: Re: [VB] BBB4 Final Report Thanks to all of You!

I think that the folks of the London Bridge bullis deserve a big pat on
the back for putting on this event!  A weekend of fun, lots of
interesting buses, meeting old and new friends, and the topper of the
whole thing doing something very nice for the children.  Beats the heck
out of a promotor-gets-rich deal any time!

Thanks, and see you in '01!

George Lyle

&gt;  We met at the office of Arizona Childrens Asso today and presented them
&gt; with 2 checks totaling $2500.00. The local newspaper was there and will run
&gt; a picture and small article. The money will be used in LHC and will help
&gt; many kids this year. We want to thank all who attended and donated items for
&gt; the raffle, with out YOU this could not happen. We were also able to donate
&gt; $100 to NEATO to help cover their yearly insurance costs ( around $800 per
&gt; year I think) More chapters should help support NEATO. Thanks again to all
&gt; who attended and helped and we will look forward to seeing you at BBB5 Jan.
