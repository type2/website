&gt; &gt;Rear fog lights? I don't believe I have seen these (or can really come
&gt; &gt;up with a good use) anyone got any pics of what this particular beast
&gt; &gt;looks like?

(replying to an earlier message)

Jason..

Rear fog lights are not to help you see to the rear like front fogs are.
They're a single bright rear red light much like a brake light.  It's
usually a fairly focused light to create almost a &quot;spot&quot;  Most latemodel
european cars are already equipped with the place on the drivers side
rear light assembly for one...the reflector and refractor is often in
place.

So what's it for?  So cars approaching you can SEE you before they hit
you. :)

Here in the state's it would probably just be interpreted as a single
brake light stuck on.
