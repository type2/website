Subject: Re: [T2] leak down test


My 78 t4 was tested with the same set up(made it myself also).

Tested with piston at *top*.

all were about 98% except #1 that was at about 85%...could feel air coming 
out of the tail pipe on that one, so I know it is a bad exh valve.

Compression on #1 &amp;3 was about 70 psi and #2 &amp; 4 was about 130 psi.

It will still run 75+ on the interstate....

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I performed my first leak down test today.  A 1600 DP from my '71. 
&gt; I have an air compressor and, thanks to a list member pointing me to 
&gt; a web site,  I bought a nifty set of gauges that monitor the pressure 
&gt; in a cylinder as 100 psi is maintained at the spark plug hole.
&gt; 
&gt; The directions for the gauges mention about leak down values of 92%. 
&gt; The highest I got on any cylinder was 48, and I could hear air 
&gt; hissing inside my case.
&gt; 
&gt; The test was performed with the piston at the bottom of the cylinder 
&gt; and the valves closed.
&gt; 
&gt; The directions did say to warm the engine to operating  temperatures. 
&gt; I couldn't do this because it was lying on the garage floor awaiting 
&gt; a tear down.  Can my  extremely low numbers be due to the temperature 
&gt; being not correct?
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has actually made this measurement on an air cooled VW 
&gt; engine, please chime in.
