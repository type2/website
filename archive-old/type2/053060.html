&gt; Was just sitting here and had the old gin mill running and was wondering if
&gt; anyone has ever put skylights in a 68 - 72 pop-top. It seems like it would be
&gt; straightforward except for the &quot;ribs&quot; in the fiberglass top. Has anyone ever
&gt; tried this?

I got the vanagon screensaver from a guy on this list, and in that screensaver is
a really good picture of a westy with a sunroof in the luggage rack.  I don't
remember the address for the download though.  Maybe someone else does?

Always looking for the swingy table and leg for my westy.
Maybe someone picked mine up from the side of the road?
Maybe I've got one coming, depending on this week's check.
