&gt; So, my front windshield seals are shot. I'm not sure how long it's been that
&gt; way

&gt; may be without pulling the window (Perhaps sound echo)?

You can look from the inside just under the seal and from below the kick
panels looking up. If you remove the windshield whatever rust is there will
be disturbed and the holes will only get bigger. Inspect and fix properly or
don't inspect is my advice.

&gt; How bad is surface rust? Is it best to sand and use a &quot;rust-reducing&quot; based
&gt; primer, ala 3M? Lots of ppl thru the archives indicate the a regular primer
&gt; may
&gt; be just fine.
&gt; How long can only primer stay on?

From the look of some vehicles, forever. ;-)
