Subject: Cool Places in NC Mountains

hiya ron...

okay...well, there are lots of places to go...the nc mountains are great
for touring in a vw bus. when are you coming through? if it's winter, then you
have skiing up near Boone, but it's awful cold. where are you thinking of
coming through?

i'd reccommend Linville Gorge, Pisgah National Forest, anywhere you can
park and get on the Appalachin Trail for a day or two hike, Asheville, and
especially Boone.

if i remember correctly Ron, you will prolly want to hit 81 at some point
right? then i'd STRONGLY suggest the following. assuming you are coming in
on i-40....i'd hit the blue ridge parkway..there are many places you can get
one...and take the parkway to Boone. it's a nice ride, a good challenge for
a bus, and some breathtaking views. make sure you've good everything you
need though...gas, spares, etc. nothing much up there.

when you get to boone there are several places you can camp...although i'd
just park somewhere overnight on the parkway...it's usually okay and i've
never been hassled by the park service. there's a great, cheap breakfast
place in boone, can't remember the name but will get it for you. that is a
must! take time to look in the shops...some neat stuff up there.

if you wanna do the touristy thing...there is chimney rock, blowing rock,
grandfather mountain, etc. but i'd steer clear of those money holes.
there are tons of trails and waterfalls to check out. if you make it
up in the fall, there are several bluegrass/music festivals which are
wonderful to check out.

let me know when/where and what you are looking for and i'll be more then
happy to get some more specific info together for you....

and if you make it raleigh ways, you must stop by and have a home cooked
meal at my place! and i've got plenty of driveway space! :-)
