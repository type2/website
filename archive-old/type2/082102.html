Unless you really need a truck for hauling stuff, I couldn't imagine getting 
rid of the ghia!

This may be, of course, due to the fact that I just recently got my 69 ghia 
coupe on the road and am having a blast driving it.  My bus has its pluses, 
but the ghia is a_much_better daily driver.

What I remember from the pre-1972 buses I used to drive were drum brakes with 
no power assist that frequently made stopping sort of a guessing game and a 
poor little bug engine that tried hard, but left a lot to be desired in such 
a heavy, square vehicle.

In comparison, my more recent 74 and 79 type 2's had the tougher type 4 
engine with more torque and hp and_much_better braking habits.  

Early type 2 trucks are classy vehicles though, I see fewer of them than I do 
ghias.  Hey, front drum brakes can be converted and I have seen some nice 
crew/single cab type4 conversions........
