Subject: Re: [T2] w8cc plugs?

You won't get near the life from the CC's as you will from the CCO's. If 
the Bentley says CCO for your engine, don't second guess. Use it and be 
sure of spec function.

&gt;Autohaus guy told me that the W8CC0 I had expected was a three electrode 
&gt;plug, not necessary, and that his shop didn't use them.

&gt;I've got to get my bus thru california smog, so I'm tuning up and getting 
&gt;new plugs. Are &quot;W8CC&quot; okay?
