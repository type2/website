Subject: new fuel sender
Date: Wed, 9 Dec 1998 22:00:16 -0800 


This is a prime example of a &quot;slash and burn&quot; repair job. Someone's fuel
guage isn't working well and it annoys them.

&lt;&lt;This is a prime example of this isnt the way I would do it so it isnt right!&gt;&gt;

Who cares about the structural integrity of the van, 

&lt;&lt;Structural integrity? Who knows this? Has any one out there
looked at data resulting from installation of strain gages with a
regime if fatiguing and static load condition measurements? This
a perfect solution to a chronic VW problem IMHO. My 76 bug, my 
80 Vanagon, my 74 bus all have had fuel sender failures. Who wants
to pull an engine just to change out a fuel sender.??&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

that the road and motor sounds and fumes will begin
to inevitable pollute the bus through this hole.

&lt;&lt;&lt;go buy a $10.00 round marine bulkhead access hatch.
this consists of a female bulkhead plate which is installed
on your back deck (sealed). Ready access is now available
via the removeable (male) threaded plug which also is &quot;O&quot;
ring sealed. These come in plastic or metal. Dont worry to much
about motor sounds unless you are missing the firewall...


          peace,
