&gt; Hello,
&gt;     I own a 1977 Westfalia and have been looking for a
&gt; bamboo parcel tray for under the dash.  I was offered
&gt; one for $25 bucks, but I didn't e-mail the guy back
&gt; fast enough.  I have also seen a repro that is not
&gt; bamboo and it's a little too expensive.  Then I got an
&gt; e-mail saying that they don't even exist.  Does anyone
&gt; know of any for sale or any information about them? 
&gt; Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate the help.

They aren't hard to make.  I made mine out of 1/4 masonite with a 1X2
strip along the edge to stiffen the shelf.  The rear edge is curved to
match the sheet metal (made a pattern from cardboard by trial-and-error).
Covered the whole thing with 1/8 foam and black naugahyde.  

It is mounted
with four &quot;hangers&quot; made from 1/8 steel wire, the front (FIF) two hung
from
screws on the air duct, the inboard rear hung from the E-brake bracket,
and the outboard rear simply hooked to the lower lip of the dashboard.

Works great, and you can customize it to your needs.
