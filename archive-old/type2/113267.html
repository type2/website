Subject: paint jobs

 Terry K said-
. . . as I keep buying and applying paint--I laugh at the thought of some
of prior postings on getting a Bus or Van refinished---at some of the
quoted prices on any list---$275.00, $500.00, even a grand---when I can
hardly get a lawn mower painted for $700.00--plus a who cares it's mine
labor figure--
 
Just some food for thought--on what is possible for the costs
quoted---and that in fact it really can't be really too much of a paint
job----not for the prices quoted---



I was doing some work with a guy who had been a auto painter (and who had
developed multiple chemical sensitivity as a result) and he said that a
good car paint job should require at least $500 in paint. Otherwise he said
that you might as well DIY with a spray can. I think he was joking about
the last part but I am not so sure.
