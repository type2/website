Subject: hesitation or surge

I was out camping by the Merced River in CA this weekend, and on the way 
back I kept getting this sudden temporary loss of power. It must only last 
about a second as it feels like ive let off of the gas pedal, and then 
pressed back down to resume speed suddenly. maybe the fuel pump is going 
out, and every so often im not getting any gas, so the motor has no power, 
then right back to normal again? It kinda makes the bus jerk forward when it 
kicks back in right away.

Any thoughts on what this could be, and/or things I could check?

It doesn't seem to do this all of the time, but for some reason on the way 
home, it was doing it almost the whole way. Maybe the engine is missing a 
beat here and there?

oh, here are some cool bus pictures :
