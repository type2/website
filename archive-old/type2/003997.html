HI

I have had a pop-top tent on the shelf for 3+ years, in the box still.

I want it out of here!!!!!   Below wholesale cost.  NEW, not NOS

I have just one, it is 68-73 I believe.

Save me, get it out of here.
Pmail me for price
thanks


I do also have an NOS seal for the same, I forgot about that!  That should
be worth something.   Let.s make a package deal.
Also have some NOS white rubber hold downs for inside pop-top, NOS in
package


happy bussin
