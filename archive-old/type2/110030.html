Subject: Tranny

Folks,

I have a tranny from a 70 bus sitting in my garage that has to go. It came in 
a load of parts I bought. To the best of my knowledge it works well. It is a 
bit dirty however. Regardless, anyone who is interested in taking it off my 
hands for say $50 can come get it...it's gotta go! One catch, you must come 
to get it (Southern Maryland about 28 miles south of DC zip code 20601). I 
wont ship that bad boy!
Any one interested? 

Melissa
