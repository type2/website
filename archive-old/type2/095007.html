Subject: VW Classic, SaveTheBays, Tires

Greetings list -

VW Classic:

We have a car-a-bus of (so far) 3 busses and a 'vert going to the VW Classic 
from the So. Cal. Burbank/Glendale area. Anyone interested in joining - 
please pmail.

SaveTheBays:

Hopefully, the print shop will come through, and we'll have some free &quot;Save 
The Bays&quot; window (or bumper) stickers for you folks with Bay Windows. See: 
www.SaveTheBays_dot_org for a picture of the stickers.

Tires:

I've put a set of Cheng Shin UE-168 (205R14C's) on Itch, and can't recommend 
them enough. $80 out the door at my local tire shop. The tough part is 
asking for them. See: http://www.maxxis-reifen_dot_de/seiten/pkw/ue168.htm or 
www.maxxis_dot_com (under &quot;light trucks&quot;) for more. Come see these at the 
Classic!

That will be all. Carry on.

Mike &amp; Itch
&quot;Save the Bays!&quot;
