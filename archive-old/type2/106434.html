Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; &gt;This would get the rpm's down on the freeway....just like you wanted....
&gt;
&gt; ..........which will also reduce the RPMs of the cooling fan,
&gt; which is not what you want.

No. It MAY be what you want. The engine is running in a thermodynamic
balance. Small changes affect the balance point. It is trial and error for
us since we dont have the skills or input to model it.
It is possible that the reduced rpm (and increased needed torque for the
same speed) will result in cooler running under specific conditions.
A typical change like the Freeway Flyer - Optimization for flat
land conditions.
