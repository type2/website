I am new and what does it mean when people say 'YOU?' Is that to 
everyone?

I drive 60-65 even though I know I should drive 55-60.  Even when its 
really cold and I just can't stand going even 65 and I go 75 everyone 
passes me.  I think its just on principle though, you can't be behind a 
VW Bus and be respected interstate driving-wise.
