Subject: Re: [T2] Ordering from overseas???

Ordered parts from BAS Ahnendorp in Germany. They shipped via UPS to the 
Little Creek Naval base who then shipped it to me via Navy mail at Cuba 
where we were in port.

The duties and such were built into the shipping cost.

&gt;I know some of you have order parts from overseas?. Question is then; How 
&gt;are the Duty fees collected?  I understand the seller charges freight, but 
&gt;do they also charge for the Duty Fees, I believe that what its' called, or 
&gt;are they collect when the parts are delivered.
