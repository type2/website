Subject: VW Birth Certificate... How?

&gt;Sean writes:
&gt;I got my '78 Bus's birth certificate today in the form of an air-mail
&gt;letter from VW AG.

so I write:
How do I do this?  I have seen several people post their bus's stats, but no
one has said (recently anyway) where they have done this.  Could someone
please tell me?

thanks
dave
