Subject: RE: [T2] vendor question

&gt; &gt;Has anyone dealt with
&gt; &gt;these guys?
&gt; &gt;http://www.vw-auto-parts-wholesale_dot_com/
&gt; There are a few businesses that are web front ends for some core
&gt; business that I haven't figured out yet.  I believe this since
&gt; they have the exact same catalogs
&gt; Maybe someone in the parts business can shed some light on this.



Sure. This is a particular wholesale distributor's attempt to court small
auto parts dealers by offering them an &quot;instant e-commerce site&quot; that they
can just paste their name onto.  The wholesaler provides the engine that
runs the site, the parts database and web interface.  The retailer adds a
few pages with his logo, adds water and stirs, and bingo, he's in the online
auto parts business.  When the order is placed, it is dropshipped directly
from that particular wholesaler, with whom the retailer has an exclusive
contract. (This means no competiton; the retailer isn't free to pick and
choose between the offerings of different wholesalers, choosing the best
possible brand and/or sourcing the part elsewhere if the one wholesaler is
out of stock.)

So, the website owner gets a free website and doesn't even have to stock a
single part. Sounds too good to be true, right?  Indeed, it is too good to
be true.  There's a very serious catch.  To enroll in this program, this
&quot;virtual retailer&quot; must commit to spending a huge amount of money with the
wholesaler, which realistically is only going to happen if his website is a
raging success.  If the retailer doesn't hit that number, he agrees to pay a
very large additional sum of money to the wholesaler - in essence a penalty
for not making his quota.  So large a sum, in fact, that it could very well
put him out of business unless he has started off with very deep pockets to
begin with.  So it's a very risky proposition, to say the least.  Still,
apparantly enough people are willing to take the gamble, because all the
sudden new auto parts websites are coming out of the woodwork, all with this
same wholesaler's web interface.  I've never heard of any of the retailers
before.  Most appeared out of nowhere and will probably disappear just as
quickly. (Like the one in question, whose domain is just two months old.)
And of course, the more of them there are, selling the identical products
out of the identical warehouse, the less each one will sell individually -
meaning that each one will be that much less likely to make his quota.  Not
exactly a pyramid scheme, but it carries much of the same risk.  I predict a
lot of bankruptcy filings when many of these retailers discover that they're
not going to hit their quotas, and can't afford to make their extra
payments.
