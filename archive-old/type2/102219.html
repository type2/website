&gt; I just put on a new alternator belt because the old one was stretched and

&gt; the online sites show is right for a 72-79 bus but the owner's manual states
&gt; 9x965 is the correct size.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the right size?  I also noticed that between two older belts I had
&gt; lying around the widths are slightly different and the distance between the
&gt; nubs on the inside are also different yet both are Continental belts labeled
&gt; 10x965.

Richard,

Just to add to the confusion, EKTA lists this belt as 9.5 x 965. I bought a
parts bus last summer and it had some spares with it, one of which was an
unused vee-belt with a VW dealer tag still on it, it was 9 x 965.
