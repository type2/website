Re: Chad Sibert's Brake trouble (flames)
on my 71 kombi i had a similar, tho different, experience.
the left front disc brake was only partially releasing.
i figured that maybe the caliper 'pistons' were possibly sticking, pulled 
the caliper, saw holes in the 'piston' boots, so installed remanufactured 
calipers on both sides.
problem still existed, turned out to be the hose, guess they can constrict 
to nothing  given enuf time, or also start to deteriorate to create 'check 
valves' inside the hose.
since my problem was one sided, like your's, didn't see how it could be a 
master cyl thing. since you've replaced the hose, i'd be lookin at the line 
next, esp if cracking the bleed screw releases the pressure when it is 
locked up.

good luck
best wishes
