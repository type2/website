Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus - racist term??

&gt; &gt;  even when packed with wetbacks

&gt; I object to this term being used on this list!
&gt; It is a racist and belittling term. I expect 
&gt; better from this international list.
&gt; Respectfully,
&gt; Courtney


I was just about to say exactly the same thing. No need for racial slurs.
