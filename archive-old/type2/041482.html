Volks,

If you do decide to install an electric fuel pump, I would suggest the
following:

You can buy just about any fuel pump that is sold in a Local auto parts
store as long as you buy a separate fuel regulator that can be set to 3 lbs.
No more. 

Next, and the list will correct me if I'm wrong, but you may need to leave
the old mechanical fuel pump connected to the engine block or you will have
to use a block off plate.

While you are under there, check your fuel lines. You may want to replace
them on the spot... especially if you started to get dirty gas in your fuel
filter. 

I would drain the tank carefully. I just did mine about an hour ago.

FIRST I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY!!!!!!!!

I pinched the fuel line just below the gas tank with a set of vice grips.
Lightly pinch just enough so the vice grips close the gas line, but do not
rupture it. 
Then I got a small gas tank (5 gallons) underneath the vehicle. I placed the
vehicle on jack stands so that I would get enough clearance. I left the
spout on the gas tank facing up to about the height of the fuel pump. Then I
gently removed the gas line from the pump and let it drain into a small cup.

Next, I placed the gas line in the spout of the 5 gallon gas tank. I watched
the level of the gas tank by jiggling it to see where the gas line was
inside the tank. When it started to get close to the top, I was ready with
my vice grips. Then I pinched off the line, removed it from the tank and
inserted a golf tee as a stop gap measure. Put the old gas in my F*rd
pickup. 

Once drained, you may want to unscrew the drain cap off of the bottom of the
tank and try to fish out any large clumps of gas tank accumulation. Use a
proper sealer when reinstalling. Use new GAS line, not vacuum line like is
on the one I'm working on.

Put it all back together with new clamps, new gas, face east, assume lotus
position and chant a mantra.

That's my anal approach,

Good luck,

Matt
