Subject: [T2] Vanagon into Bay

&gt; Have an '82 Vanagon 2 liter with a burnt valve.  Runs great on three 
&gt; cylinders. Fresh rebuild by a cut rate shop (SIR) 12k miles ago.  Have 
&gt; a '77 bay (Bleu) with a seriously tired motor. Leaks a quart of oil 
&gt; every hundred miles or so...
&gt; 
&gt; Plan is to pull the heads from each motor and have the '77 heads 
&gt; redone. Install on the '82 motor and have a cheap rebuild.
&gt; 
&gt; Any gotchas that I should be aware of?  I'm aware of the dipstick and 
&gt; breather differences.  Doesn't really seem to be a big deal.

Vanagons have square port heads and '77's have round port heads.
