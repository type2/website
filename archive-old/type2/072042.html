&gt;nice sorry,,,,but did you finally get it out of there ??????

oh yah, thanks, it was a slowboat to china though. from 4:30am to 4:30pm
with the auto transport in tow. i was a little surprised that going over
high passes in shasta and ashland was easier than the tall narrow hills on
high 5 in southwest oregon. its all in the grade. i hope to get all the
lingering AM radio out of my head before the brakes are done.

biting my knuckle learning how much front brake cylinders cost. MIKE!  :)
bless this list, long live a*i*r*s*, room temp!
