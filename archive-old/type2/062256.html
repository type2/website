Subject: Re: FI to sheet metal rod?

Assuming that you have a 2L FI.  If it's what I think it is it's the 
EGR pipe.  If so it's supposed to start at the exhaust system with a 
short pipe to a flange.  Then it's the EGR filter from that flange to 
the underside of the left side tin ending on a flange.  From the top 
of the tin, the rod, actually a pipe, from a flange to the EGR valve 
which is bolted to the side of the mixer box. The EGR valve is 
supposed to have a spring loaded arm going to the throttle 
connection.  This is what I have (supposed to) on my '80 non-CA 2L.
There, that said, the EGR has been discussed in past posts, but the 
short version is, yes it runs fine (mine does too) but the chances of 
overheating are increased due to too much oxygen in the mix for 
combustion.  In addition to reducing emissions, it helps keep your 
engine running cooler.  Haven't priced that particular tube, but the 
EGR filter is about $162 and a rebuilt EGR valve is about $229.  The 
connection to the throttle was $16 about 8 years ago.  Emission stuff 
pricing is from 'Help Smog Parts' 209-636-7450 haven't purchased 
anything from them, but seem helpful over the phone.

&gt; What does the long metal rod that connects the FI (near throttle) to the
&gt; top cooling tin on the left side do?  My bus seems to run fine without it
&gt; ( it did not have one when I got it).  Is is some kind of strutural support?
