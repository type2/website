&gt; What's recommended for cleaning the engine: parts, tins, et al.?
&gt; I read kerosene, gasoline, &quot;solvent&quot; (too generic a term).  And how does one
&gt; go about eliminating the waste?

Gasoline is too volitile, but I have to admit to using it for small jobs.
Not a good thing, though.

Kerosene works well, but is pretty flammable too.

I use spray degreaser, wich is probably a kerosene/diesel-like mix in a
spray can.  IT doesn't work miracles.  You still need to use a fair amount
of elbow grease to loosen the layers of oil and dirt.

I then rinse the parts with water over a large pan.  The degreaser and oil
float and can be skimmed off for disposal with your waste oil.  

There are
supposedly biodegradable degreasers out there, but they don't seem to be
much friendlier than the petroleum solvents, since they carry the grease
away with them.  I prefer the better-acting petroleum solvents.

One good idea is to hook your garden hose up to a hot-water source.  Hot
water blasts the munge off easier than cold!
