Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust conversion

&gt; &gt; Has anyone on
&gt; &gt; the list done it on a '79 who could confirm one way or the other?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 79 california spec westy, and I have looked into this as well.
&gt; I converted it to use 72-74 exhaust and kept the o2 sensor.

&gt; I am working on a new exhaust system for my bus which should become the
&gt; prototype for a new product. It will use the 72-74 heater boxes and a
&gt; custom made crossover

Hi Scott,

The prototype exhaust system your working on sounds interesting. 
Keep us updated I'd like to learn more about the project when it
completed.

You mentioned you converted your 79 California spec westy to use
72-74 exhaust. I'm not sure if I'm understanding you right. Your
using the 72-74 muffler but what year heat exchanger are you using?
In the photo of your O2 sensor it looks like the exhaust tubes 
leading from the heads are oval. 

Alex
