Hi, Ric--

Since your cable is already out [it is, right?], I vote for Scott's 
vacuum-and-string idea. It appeals to the McGuyver in me. But if you are 
ever in this situation again, there's a great trick that, unfortunately, 
only works if you do it *while the old cable is still in place.* For what 
it's worth, I'm pretty sure I got this idea from the type2_dot_com 
archives--props to whoever originally posted the idea.

Get a length air hose from an aquarium supply place, using whatever inside 
diameter will fit snugly over the square drive end of the cable [I forget 
the specs at the moment], and buying enough so that you have a piece about a 
foot or so longer than the replacement cable.

Slip the tubing over the end of the old cable [I also used some fine wire to 
twist around it to make sure it stayed put], knot the other end so it won't 
pull through, then carefully draw the old cable back out, pulling the tubing 
back through the hole after it until the tubing is sticking out under the 
dash where you can easily reach it. Pull the tubing off the old cable end 
and fasten it to the new cable the same way, lubricate the new cable, then 
slowly and carefully use the tubing to pull the new cable back through.

Worked like a charm for me.  I know it's not too helpful for you if you've 
already got the old cable out, but hey--in a couple hundred thousand miles 
you might face this problem again, or you might buy another bus, or . . .

Good luck!
