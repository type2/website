&gt;and Bosch JF-4 distributor. Everything was run into the ground and all
are now rebuilt. However I am having difficulty with the timing, carbs
and distributor balancing act. It is running but is coughs, pops and
chokes.

&gt;Once it gets past that, it gets up and goes but with lotsa flat spots.

Is a &quot;JF4 distributor&quot; another name for the dreaded 009 centrifugal only
distributor? If so they are notorious for flat spots. Try replacing it
with a new or good 2ndhand SVDA distributor.

&gt;The carbs ran great on a 2L transporter motor, but not on this this.

Did you rejet them for the smaller engine? Have they been set up to
&quot;lean, best idle&quot; and balanced?

HTH,

Martin
