Subject: Of lawn mowers, hornets, and Volkswagens
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Yesterday was not a good day.  It all started innocently enough, with me
mowing the lawn ... right over a hornets nest!  While being stung repeatedly
by a large nest of angry hornets, I veered off of the lawn on my riding
mower, and onto the gravel driveway, on which were parked my Westy and
Evon's Passat.  Right before the blade of the mower sheared off, it managed
in its dying gasp to hurl gravel through the rear window of my Westy, the
side power mirror of my Westy, and the rear window of Evon's Passat. My
insurance company is going to love this one!
