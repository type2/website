Subject: Radio installation in a 78

Hi Everyone!,

About 2 months ago I was able to salvage an original Volkswagen radio from 
a junk yard.  I gave it some TLC, hooked it up to my 12v tester battery and 
it works great.  Now I need to install it.  The previous owner had a stereo 
installed that he claimed used to work.  When I removed the stereo there 
were wires everywhere.  I think I have found the &quot;power&quot; wire and have 
connected it to the radio.  I purchased a new 4in speaker from  Radio Shack 
and installed it nicely in the dash.  To make a long story short... it does 
not work.  Anyone have any idiot's guide to car radio installation?  I have 
never installed one before and it seems straight forward.

By the way... it has been a long time since I posted.  This is because I 
archive all the posts here at home and while fixing &quot;Bess the Bus&quot; I just 
search my own home archive and have found the correct leads each time.

Thanks to everyone for all their advice!

&quot;Bess the Bus&quot; lives!
Don Manzano
