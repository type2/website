Subject: welding bumper brackets to frame, 71

Of the 4 bolts that hold the bumper brackets to the frame on my 71, only one 
is still fully functional. one kinda, and the 'nuts' have come off the other 
two.
I'm thinking of welding the brackets to the frame, seems too simple, anyone 
see a downside to this?
Thanks
Denny Johnson
