Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Alloy Wheel Package



I go by tire wear- find that most overinflate their rear tires.  Use a
tire gauge to check center vs edge tread depth.  When not carrying a lot
of stuff, 32 psi gives even wear on the Westy.

&gt; Shouldn't the air pressure chosen be based on the tire manufacturer's
&gt; figures and not on the VW sticker? Alot of tire technology has come along
&gt; since the tire pressure stickers were applied at the VW factory.
