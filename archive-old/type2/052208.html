Subject: [T2] sudden idle problem - please help

While out driving today in my '71 1600, I came to a light and stalled.  I
re-started from first, clutch in, and just tapping the gas sent my idle to
2500, it stayed there for 2-3 seconds, then dropped back down to zero and
stalled again.  I got out, checked linkage quick, checked for gas leaks etc,
but I didn't see anything unusual.  So I re-started again, same thing
happened, but this time I kept the idle high enough to get moving.
Everything felt sluggish though.  Oil temp and pressure stayed stable.   I
made it home (1 mile), going through all the gears.  In my driveway it
stalled from 2nd.  I put in nuetral, re started, and watched the tach go to
2500 agian, stay there, then go right down to zero.  I have only been
starting it, or driving it once a week(I live in CT), and until today, it
has been fine.  It usually idles at 1,000, gears and clutch are tight and
responsive, and moves along just fine.  I'm 5,000 miles into a complete
engine rebuild and new clutch.  Can anyone get me started on some more
things to check out?

Thanks, Don
