Hi all prospective type 2 buyers.
I just bought a near mint 83 Westy with a burned piston for $1500.
Pulled engine and found all good except for #4. Replaced #4, oil cooler
etc and it runs fine all for less than $200.
Bought a real clean 84 Vasserboxer Westy 3-4 years ago, also a non
runner for $1000 and found that all that was wrong was bent push rods
due to improper assembly by botch artists after a valve job. Replaced
push rod and cutch and if ran great. Sold because I prefer air cooled
cooled due to simplicity. Those Vasserboxers are really complex what
with A/C, power steering and coolant lines running from front to rear.
Only advantage is a little more power and heat!
Just my .02 cents worth.
