Hello,

I just loosened the clamp that goes around the small end of the CV joint
boot up near the transmission. Whatever is in there came running out. It
seemed to have the viscosity and general appearance of gear oil. Is it
possible that gear oil has somehow leaked out of the tranny and into the CV
boot, or has the grease just gone bad? This only happened with one of the
four boots.

Thanks
