Set the 009 timing at 30 degrees BTDC _at_ 3,500 RPM. The 009 does not have =
the ideal advance curve for your engine; it has a bad flat spot when the =
car is taking off. You'll have better performance at all RPMs with a =
rebuilt stock vacuum/centrifugal advance distributor.

Used Bosch dizzies usually develop excessive axial (up &amp; down) play long =
before they develop side-to-side play. This can often be fixed by =
replacing the insulative washer(s) above the distributor shaft dog gear =
on the bottom end of the dizzy shaft. Bosch makes a distributor rebuild =
kit which contains insulative washers.

Place the distributor shaft in a vice, using a nail punch and hammer, =
drive the pin out of the side of the dog gear/dizzy shaft, remove the =
dog gear, replace the washer(s) and dog gear, and drive the pin back =
through the hole in dog gear and shaft. You can replace the dog gear two =
ways: don't get it 180 degrees off or it'll back fire like a .38 =
Special.

While you have the dizzy out is a good time to scrub it in solvent and =
lube it thoroughly with heavy oil, including the swinging centrifugal =
advance weights in the bottom half of the dizzy. On the side of the =
dizzy is a little metal cap that you can pry off the get at the swinging =
weights.

Hey all ...

A new engine I recently set up for a friend's Beetle is having some =
growing=20
pains. I overhauled the carb and swapped out the stock distributor for a =
009=20
(stock one was pretty worn). My question: what adjustments do I need to =
make=20
to the mixture and volume settings to get the carb to idle well? The =
stock=20
settings do not seem to work well with the 009 ... it tends to stall =
when=20
the choke unloads before the engine is fully warmed. Any advice on=20
adjustments to the mixture and volume screws to work with the 10 degrees =

BTDC timing at idle? (the original dist. timed at 2 or 3 degrees ATDC =
... we=20
are at 8,000 feet asl)

I know someone will have some insight on this ...

Thanks very much,
