WOH THERE, before you look for a replacement dash make sure its not an Europe 
blunder.  I have seen so many different 66's and 71's and 61's, etc., it's 
unbelievable.  Many times its not a changed item but stock for the year.  My 
grandpa who is German by the way, told me about his buddy that worked at 
wolfsburg right after the war and how they would grab any year part sometimes 
just to finish a vehicle.  true story.  And he retired in 1964 and said it 
was still common practice.  But it could have been swapped, but if its a real 
clean job, I'd wonder...
Peace Out
Rick
