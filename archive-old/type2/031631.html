&gt; I'm looking to buy a canoe (about 16' and 60lbs), and I was 
&gt; wondering if those of you with experience in these matters could 
&gt; suggest how best to attach it to the top of a bus ('71, no pop-top).  
&gt; Do I need a rack (if so, what kind), or can I use a simple tie-down 
&gt; kit (foam blocks between the gunwales and the roof and lines 
&gt; running from the bow and stern to the bumpers).  I'm hoping for a 
&gt; benign and stable relationship between the two vehicles, as well as 
&gt; the improved gas mileage promised in the type2 archives!

I have had a 17ft for years and years, I've owned it since long before my  
van rolled off the assembly line and it's a 78..had it on a bunch of buses
over the years....tried it both ways but I like the way it rides and
handles when pulled down tight against the bus roof.._dot_depending on the
lines of the canoe it can be a pretty tight fit..

flashing paddles to you
