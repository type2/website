Subject: Re: [T2] intermittent loss of power.

running a few things by, thinking out loud maybe

78 stock with auto tranny and pertronix

suddenly I have an intermmittent loss of power under load, not complete
and engine  has never even stalled.  started suddenly (after a fill up???)
I have checked fuel delivery, changed the fuel filter.

I suspect a weak spark??  or someother electrical problem..  changed the
coil marginally better but it is an old coil... probably need a new one
anyway. no sounds, guages all read normally, nothing out of the ordinary
except the lack of power, doesn't even sound like it is missing...

still running some checks, actually killing some time while I wait for it
to cool down after last test run, will be pulling plugs next.  it has been
running rich too. but nothing sudden like, just needs a tune up

any wild ideas???

thanks
Bob
