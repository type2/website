Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy timing

Ralph,

You didn't mention how it runs?


Only a few places it can happen.

Injector not closing after shutoff.
Cold start injector not closing after shutoff.

Hole in a piston?
really really really bad rings....not too probable unless
	an injector is leaking.

I can't think of anyplace else that fuel even comes close to being able
to get in the crankcase.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks for all of the answers. Some PO evidently removed the timing strip
&gt; so I will replace. Thanks. Anyone have suggestions,remarks about how gas
&gt; is getting in the oil? I have checked the injectors, cold start valve,
&gt; replaced the points which were pitted and replaced the injector seals. I
&gt; also used gas treatment and drove several miles- still gets fuel in oil.
