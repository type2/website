&gt; &gt;not sure if there is enough room to come all the way back, you may have to
&gt; &gt;tilt a little (I have an automatic slightly different pull out) some
&gt; &gt;people swear by dropping the tranny rear a little but I do it the same as
&gt; &gt;you have planned.
&gt; 
&gt; There is not enough room to simply pull the engine straight back unless you
&gt; remove the oil tube as Bob mentioned, and in addition the exhaust,
&gt; alternator, fan shroud, and rear tin.  Not worth it IMO.  Dropping the
&gt; engine and tranny together is the most dignified way to do it.

the one or two times I lowered em both together I put a chain fall under
the tranny hooked to the holes in the tranny support and lowered the whole
thing about 2-3 inches, not enough to require removing axles, linkages or
anything else but the two big tranny bolts.
  this was all the distance needed to pull it straight back

you don't need to take the tranny completely out it even flexes at the
nose enough   YMMV
