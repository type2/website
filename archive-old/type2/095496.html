Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] A/C for a Baywindow

  Are you sure he didn't mean 2 condensors? Duel evaporaters is just like
having front and rear air in a late model van and would be rather bulky in a
under dash unit, etc. The I C E units use 2 condensers, 1 under the bus with
fan/fans and another smaller unit in the engine compartment. They also use a
Sanden or similar compressor, The I C E unit are the same as in the new old
style beetles out of Mexico. They build them for those cars. About 5 years
ago I C E had a new old beetle at the Classic, they let the car run ALL DAY
with the A C on to show how it worked (F I car) and so you could see the
load on an engine. With todays new A C compressors, a alternater robs more H
P from an engine then the A C compressors!!!

ronnie  putting A C in my wifes 65 beetle and my 60 D C

ps. For people that are really handy you can buy just components from Frigid
Air and there are a few other companies in Texas that sell components, in
case you don't know auto A C was invented in Texas, that's why there are
more A C manufacturers there then any other state in the country

&gt;&gt;A buddy of mine is in serious need of an A/C system for a '72 bus.
&gt;
&gt;Here is an email response from a company who is manufacturing a
&gt;completely NEW system that is OVER TWICE as powerful as the original!!
&gt;
&gt;ON OUR A/C UNITS, THEY ARE BUILT WITH 2 EVAP. ASSEMBLES EACH HAVING
&gt;16,000 BTU EACH. WE USE A ROTOR SANDEN 508 COMPRESSOR, THAT ONLY PULLS
&gt;1 1/2 HORSEPOWER OF THE MOTOR.

You canna' change the laws of physics, Jim!

Assuming that the &quot;BTU&quot; rating is really &quot;BTU/hour&quot;, which is how
most A/C equipment is measured:

32,000 Btu/hr * 1 hr/3600 s = 8.89 Btu/s
8.89 Btu/s * 1.05506 kW/1 Btu/s = 9.38 kW
9.38 kW * 1 hp/0.74570 kW = 12.6 hp
