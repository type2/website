Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

Plywood won't last in any application where it gets repeated moisture. It also swells quiet a bit when wet. Obviously some will be better than others. The point is that plywood relies on glue to hold itself together. 

In the long run hardwoods are the best option. Look for a hardwood specialist supplier as they are much cheaper. Locally about 50% cheaper. Maybe a cabinet maker would sell/give you some scrap/offer some helpful insight to your wood problems.
