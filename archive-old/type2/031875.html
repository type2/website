&gt; Ok, so why is there no one getting these things approved?  I mean, I 
&gt; understand the cost barriers on this, I understand the time and effort 
&gt; involved on this; but these things DO work better than a normal hose (I 
&gt; know, no proof).

FYI, there are now DOT approved SS/teflon brake lines.  I've even seen
them advertised in magazines.  Thats all I'm going to say on the subject
though.

Laters!

Ryan quotes........

I was furling my wieldy umbrella when I saw...a descript person, a woman
in a state of total array. Her hair was kempt, her clothing shevelled,
and she moved in a gainly way.&quot; His reaction: &quot;I was plussed. It was
concerting to see that she was communicado, and it nerved me that she
was interested in a pareil like me. ... I acted with mitigated gall and
made my way through the ruly crowd with strong givings.&quot;
