Subject: Re: Jetting

Very sound advice! When I ran a stock carb on my '68 bus, I used an
adjustable main jet -- really, really a nice little unit. Don't know if
they are still available, but it worked beautifully. You have to adjust
it out on the highway, of course, so you can do a 15 minute cruise at
65, then kill the engine and coast to a stop, pull a plug, preferably
#3, and check the color. 
      If you want better mpg, put on a smaller carb, and jet it right,
don't put in smaller jets than the factory, ever. Heck, bigger rear
tires would get you further in mpg than smaller jets.
