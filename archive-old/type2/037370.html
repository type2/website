Subject: pop top question(might be a dumb ?)

to the list,
this question was just posted to a yahoo vw club i am
a member of and it got me thinking.   i was wondering
if anyone could enlighten me on this:  the gentleman
asked why westy's have pop tops that raise forward as
well as rear facing.   is this a year specific thing,
or an option thing.   im just basically curious and
like to have useless knowledge to fill my head instead
of the important stuff.   if this is an obvious answer
?, i apologize, ive got a riviera anyways:)
