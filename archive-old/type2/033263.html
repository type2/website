 &gt; Secondly, I have the extra 1.5 quart oil sump,
 which
 &gt; makes warm-up take
 &gt; longer. I need the choke to keep the idle RPM up
 for
 &gt; an extra 3-5 minutes.
 &gt; My options? Crank the choke another few degrees
 CCW,
 
 Well, seems to me, if you're already running too
 rich,
 this would only make matters worse.
 
 
 &gt; or somehow convince the
 &gt; choke spring not to unwind so quickly (take the
 &gt; electric lead off?).
 
 I may be way off, here...but it seems that without
 the
 electrical lead, the coil (choke-solenoid, that is)
 would have to wait for the throttle body itself to
 get
 up to sufficient temperature before shutting itself
 off (going to the full-open position). If you live
 in
 a truly cold area, that may not happen 'til next
 spring;-) I don't think I'd go that route, but it
 certainly would be the easiest thing to try (a
 little
 carbon on the plugs won't kill you).
 
 &gt; 
 &gt; So... Take off the butterfly? 
 
 
 Good luck. I tried pulling mine to straighten a
 bend,
 but couldn't get the screws out!
 
 
 Ok....so here's a really &quot;out-there&quot; idea....how
 about
 putting a voltage-drop (12v-6v) on the electric
 lead?
 In *theory*, being at half the voltage, it *should*
 take *twice* as long to open the coil. These things
 are available at most VW FLAPS, for people with
 original 6v wiring on headlights, horn, etc., that
 have coverted to a 12v battery...I recall them being
 about $8.00. You could even remove it during the
 summer months if needed.
  
 So...before you do this, get some more input; I'd
 hate
 for you to fry anything because my hair-brained
 ideas
 (I can just hear George's brain warming up for the
 rebuttal!!!!;-)!
 
 
 Let us know what works, as I need to do something
 similar....
