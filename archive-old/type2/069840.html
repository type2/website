Yup with two &quot;U&quot;s. End of Tour blow-out. Saw several members of the Arizona
Bus Club at the show. Bus count was pretty slight. Not the amount of &quot;tour
warriors&quot; as before. Had a &quot;twirlin'&quot; great time. 8)

If any of the list Deadies want details I have them written up. Contact me
privately for the scoop.
