I would refute it. There's one in Central Iowa - about 45 min northeast
of Ames, Iowa that has the most complete collection of $50-$500 VWs I've
ever seen. Most run, and are in salvagable shape, and they part things
out for $5-$10 a part, dpending. They have probably close to 6-700 of
all types, and ALL are air-cooled.

I've not seen many like this, and others may be bigger, but this one is
run by an old guy who knows everything about every part he's got, and
works on the like a pro.
