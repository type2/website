Not sure about your 77, but I believe it is in some way like my 71. 
There is a
back contact (this contact closes when there is no pressure, i.e.,
brakes are
not being applied.  The back contact has to do with the brake warning
indicator
light on the dash.  I think the indicator lights when the brake light
switches
(there is one in each section of the master cylinder) do not both pick
up when
brake pressure is applied.

&gt; My brake light are not working on my 1977 bus. Here's what I've done; found
&gt; brake switch on brake Master cylinder, unhooked the wire harness from one
&gt; switch that has three prongs with ign on wired across, brake lights work? It
&gt; started to rain so haven't tried the other switch. I think this means the
&gt; switch is bad but I'm confused with the two switches? Does this mean both
&gt; are bad(seems unlikely) do both have to be good for the brake lights to
&gt; work? Also not sure what the other prong does on the switch? How hard is it
&gt; to bleed the brakes and any tips if I need to replace the switches.
