Subject: RE: [T2] Cyl Head temperature Sensors

The stock CHT sensor hole is probably a terrible place for the aftermarket
CHT sender. Just looking at the location, you can see that it is on the edge
of the head, in the much cooler air of the engine compartment, right next to
the air flow from the vents. The FI system only needs to know if the engine
is relatively hot or cold. It's not attempting to measure an exact value in
degrees F. With an aftermarket CHT, you want to measure a location that has
the highest temperatures of any part of the head, usually near #3 spark
plug. Installing the VDO sender on #3 plug is problematic, and I gave up on
it. I took a suggestion from the archives and wedged the sender between to
cooling fins near #3 plug. The jury is still out on that location...I
suspect it may be reading cooler than expected. I need to get some highway
time to be sure...

Hey guys, yet another question...

	I purchased a book called &quot;How to rebuild your air cooled Volkswagen
engine&quot; or something, and it mentioned that some cyl heads had actual tapped
holes that allow you to bolt in the cyl head temperature sensors. Rather
than pulling apart my heat tins or whatever they're called... can someone
tell me.. do ALL 1.8s have the cyl head temperature sensor holes?
