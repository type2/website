&gt; I just got Tom wilson's book &quot;How to rebuild your volkswagen air cooled engine&quot; and man, is that a great book.  I have read about half of it already and have added tons of knowledge to my brain.  Chapter one is very informative.  If you ask me, it should be required reading for all VW owners.

does that cover rebuilding type 4 2L?
