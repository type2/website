Subject: Syncro Trans Rebuild

Hey all, sorry about posting a wasserleaker Vanagon question here, but the
Vanagon &quot;mailing list&quot; is down. I need to rebuild the transmission on an
'86 Syncro and need to know where in the San Jose area (bay area,
california) I can buy the needed parts to rebuild this trans. Any leads
would be greatly appreciated ;). Thanks!
