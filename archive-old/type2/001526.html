&gt;I'm in the middle of putting together my 70 Bus.  Right now my attention is
&gt;focused on the rear bumper.  I've got most of the parts for a nice OEM
kinda
&gt;restoration but I am missing the rubber seals which run along the outside
of
&gt;the bumper splash pans.  I know somebody (probably a bunch of somebodies)
on
&gt;the List has had to have run into this problem before.  Where can I find
&gt;these seals?


If you find some please let the list know.  I didn't think they were
available anywhere.
I made some for mine using the following method:
  1. Bought long enough piece of 3/8&quot; rubber hose from my local Ace Hardware
to
      do the job.
  2. Got an old inner tube and cut a piece out of the curved section to sort
of match
      the curve in the VW splash pan.    Cut the piece wide enough so that
when
      doubled around the 3/8&quot; rubber hose, it will be about what the width
of the original
      piece was.
  3. Wrap this long piece of inner tube around the lenght of rubber hose and
glue it
      together with 3M weather strip adhesive 08008 or 08011.  I used many
many
      clothes pins to clamp the rubber together while the adhesive was
drying.
  4. After the adhesive dries:
      Use a razor blade or razor knife to cut a slit in the piece of inner
tube and the
      3/8&quot; rubber tubing, where the inner tube wraps around the tubing.
This allows
      the new 'splash seal' to slip onto the metal splash plate as the
original one did.
      Be careful to cut this slit as the original one was cut, it will not
be directly in the
      middle of the tube.
  5. Slip your new seal on the metal splash pan and put it back on your VW.
