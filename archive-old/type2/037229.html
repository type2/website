Subject: Re: my bus is a piece of crap

the thing is....I'm not getting full motion...
It seems as if it isn't moving far enough to disengage the clutch.  when I
yoink on that arm that the cable hooks into on the trans....it doesn't move
with my power (as it shouldn't).  so I'm hoping something up front as I'm not
in the mood to do an engine pull today.


&gt;
&gt; other.  I'm betting on a broken clutch fork, but it could also be a worn
&gt; out lever on the clutch pedal pivot.  If youare getting full motion on the
&gt; clutch arm on the transmission, then you need to pull the engine and check
&gt; the throwout fork and shaft.
