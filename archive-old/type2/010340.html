	Paul,
	The model year for VW begins after the August shutdown. New model 
vehicles are assembled beginning late August/early September of the 
previous year, so your '1965' could have been built any time between
September 1964 and July 1965. This is fairly typical in the 
automobile business. Our '70' single cab was build in December, 1969.

	VW Milton Keynes say yours was built December 18, 1964, VW Germany give
December 16, 1964 and say it was shipped on the 22nd. Wanna bet the
number plate was attched to a chassis on the 16th and bus rolled off
the assembly line on the 18th? 

	You say the chassis number is 235 076 845, and the '076 845' implies
yours is a late year model. If the dates VW give you are correct, your
bus was built at the end of the last third of the production year. (Sept.,
Oct,, Nov., Dec.,), thus not a late model. The first question to answer
is how many 1965 busses VW made. If they made 250,000 or so, then your
serial number is indeed at the end of the first third, just like the
dates imply. If they made 80,000 1965 busses, then another answer is
required. Were 1965 busses made in more than one plant? Could the
serial numbers have been assigned in blocks?

	Bill
