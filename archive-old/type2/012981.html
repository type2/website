I think you're probably right about the balancing.

I'd really like to try to build the engine that would last 145,000 miles
like the first engine and balancing could make a major difference in the
long term.

I'm fairly befuddled about which is the best way to go on the other
parts. With options like German or Brazillian rings and various choices
on main and rod bearing sources,

Has any body out there on the type2 compiled a preference of Name Brands
for rebuild items?

I hear complaints about gasket sets, cylinder heads and engine
rebuilders. I tend to lean towards the German parts but after all they're
all just aftermarket parts. Aren't they?

I don't want to get stuck in the rut of just buying the cheapest to get
by. I've got a Beck Arnold parts distributor here in Dallas but quite
frankly we have a case of sour grapes, they're liars. I've made several
trips to pick up parts that they said were in stock and then when i got
there they wanted a deposit to order it.

I'm getting 35 to 40 K miles between major maintenance and can sometimes
go a year or so with just a couple of changes of points and plugs mixed
with 3k oilchanges.

RE: Solution to the cylinder head setup = cc the cylinder on TDC with 5
wt oil to the first lowest spark plug thread. With the engine on the
table this counds like the most accurate.
