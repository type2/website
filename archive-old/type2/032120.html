&gt;  Thinkin' to replace Ramona's fuel pump since I have noticed a

In addition to seconding the advice to check the gasket and clean the
filter, which already got mentioned, I'll confess my close encounter a
year or so ago with the brass tube that comes out of the pump headed
toward the carburetor:  I was driving along at 4.30am and suddenly [a]
smelled gas REALLY strong and [b] felt the engine cut out exactly the way
it used to in the good old days when I ran out of gas a lot before I got
the fuel guage working. Grabbed my fire extinguisher and a flashlight and
found that the pipe had come free from the pump and was dangling at the
end of the hose from the filter [still held firmly in place by a hose
clamp on that end, for those who appreciate irony]. The pump [a 68-70
model, according to Bentley] had been busily pumping raw gas into the
engine compartment.  Yi!  Until that moment, I didn't realize that the
brass fitting is &quot;press-fit&quot; into the casing of the pump--Bertie Wooster
would say it was bunged in.  I haven't been that wide awake at 4.30am in
quite awhile.

The old pump is now a desk paperweight, and I have a new one in the bus.  

So anyway, maybe you might want to check to see if it's leaking around
that fitting, too, just for the hell of it.
