&gt; Can anyone tell if all the bay-windows came with belly pans or was that just

Well, as others have mentioned, all buses, split and bay came with a pan
under the pedals in the front.  In the center section, the situation is a
bit different.  There are a couple of different &quot;belly pans&quot; that came
under some, but not all bays.  

First, on early bay (and possibly late split) buses, when VW punched a
hole in the roof (for a poptop or sunroof), they added re-enforcing plates
between the rockers and the main frame channels underneath.  These were
welded on.  They certainly appear on '68-72 sunroof buses. They may appear
on '68-72 sunroof-based westies. I know they do *not* appear on '73
westies. I don't know if they appear on any other years/styles, but would
suspect late splits with poptops or sunroofs.

Second, on late bays with BA-6 gas heaters, there is a pan to protect the
heater.  this pan spans the two main frame channels, but does not extend
to the rockers.  The BA-6 starts appearing in '76, so it is possible to
find one on any bus after that date, and perhaps on buses of earlier
vintage that have been retrofitted with a BA-6.  I *think* the '76
installation I saw was a factory intall and the earliest I have seen, but
by all means correct me if I am wrong!

&gt; Mine doesnt have one and I don't know if it had one at one time and
&gt; just fell off or what. 

The front pan is a bit of a &quot;sacrificial lamb.&quot;  The purpose is to protect
the steering gear from moisture and salt, but in the process of
protecting, they tend to rust to death young.  If you are in a rust belt
area, finding one in decent shape is tough.  In salt-free areas, of
course, they serve no purpose (he said, facetiously) so they are often
removed and trashed and therefore they are hard to find in those areas as
well :-( Junkyards are the only source, and they are scarce there.  That
said, they are very necessary for long life of the bus (and we *are*
aiming for long life for our buses, right? :-)

&gt; When doing resto's do a lot of people bother with the belly pan ?

Well, I do!  As I said above, mechanically they are necessary to protect
the steering gear from the elements and I tend to aim for mechanically
sound buses, rather than restorations.  I regard them a necessary. OTOH, I
live in an area where salt happens, so protecting the steering gear is a
very good idea :-)

Then you get into the separate (and contentious) issue of a &quot;resto&quot;.  If
you mean &quot;resto&quot; as in &quot;custom resto&quot;, then anything goes... it is your
bus, do what you want.  You have my advice above, but it's up to you.

If you are doing a &quot;restoration&quot;, tho, that means returning your bus to as
close to showroom condition as you can.  You can't subtract anything, you
can't add anything.  What is on the bus has to match what VW put there,
including the additions that are on your M-code plate, but no additions
that are not (no adding a gas heater or ambulance fans, ferinstance) &quot;It's
a restored U.S. model '75 with a 1600DP motor&quot; would not cut it. Neither
would &quot;It's a restored '71 passenger bus, but I have not got the middle
seat.&quot; The pan under the steering gear is not as obvious, but replacing it
would be basic to a restoration.
