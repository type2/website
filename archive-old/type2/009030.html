                                Day Four

8. A bike race and open desert

Saturday morning. I just slept nine hours. I have never slept for nine 
hours in a motel. Never. 

If you have been following the story so far, you have probably noticed 
that I am a little down on motels. The reason for this is that I was 
mugged, by two gun-carrying muggers, at a La Quinta outside Denver three 
years ago. They knocked on my door and I opened it. I didn't have much 
money on me -- who carries cash? -- but that made the whole situation all 
the more ambiguous. Since then, I have had to stay in motels to attend 
academic conferences, and I cringe whenever someone knocks on the door. 
Notice, if you stay in motels, how often that happens -- even if you hang 
the &quot;privacy please&quot; or &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign from the doorknob. Even if 
you ask the manager to request that housekeeping not knock. The bottom 
line is, it's not your room. It's theirs.

Whether camping in a VW camper is objectively safer is a moot point. What 
matters is that when I do so, I feel as though have substantially more 
control over my circumstances. And the consequence -- previously just a 
theory, but now proven -- is that I sleep better.

By now, three days into my first road trip in Peregrine, I have a 
routine. I even have the sense that I can handle whatever mechanical 
difficulties may come my way. Maybe I am getting a little smug, and that 
can be dangerous. But I feel that I have accomplished something of value. 
In our daily telephone conversation, my wife let me know that she was 
impressed that I had gotten the bus to Tucson. That felt good.

With repairs completed on the alternator the day before, I look forward 
to driving across the Arizona upland on something other than an 
interstate highway. I am headed for Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, 
cutting across the Tohono O'odham reservation on Arizona route 86. On the 
way I will pass by Kitt Peak National Observatory; maybe I will make a 
detour and head up to visit there. 

I shower, batten down, and head out. Peregrine purrs her loud purr. The 
first several miles are on I-10 and they pass quickly. I get off on Ajo 
Way, which is already route 86. But something is different. Peregrine is 
not purring. The idle is rough, and the engine feels like a cylinder is 
not firing. I pull into a gas station, gas up, check the oil (my, the oil 
has gotten dirty) and look for something obvious to explain why she is 
running as she is.

The problem could be any number of things. At the top of the list is the 
fuel mixture. I do not have the EGR hooked up; to compensate, I have 
taken the wires that lead to the throttle microswitch and put them 
together. Ordinarily, the bus would run a little rich only at full 
throttle but I have her running rich all the time. I decide to reverse 
this stopgap and plug the leads into the microswitch. There is no change. 
I cannot find any vacuum leaks, and I doubt that there is anything wrong 
with the fuel injection. I decide to see how she does at speed, so I get 
back on Ajo Way.

But speed isn't in the equation. A few blocks from the interstate I 
discover that Ajo Way, which is also route 86, is knee-deep in bicyclists 
this morning. There seems to be a race, or a rally, and every clump of 
riders has some kind of motor vehicle to set the pace of the other 
vehicles on the highway. Along with everyone else, I crawl along in 
first. When at last we can pass, it is but a few miles before the whole 
situation repeats. I look on the bright side. At least I am not the 
slowest vehicle on the road this morning. 

The worst of it is that even though we are crawling along at a snail's 
pace, I am missing the scenery. All my concentration is on keeping 
Peregrine moving forward and stopping without stalling or over-revving. 
So close to Tucson, one might think that the scenery wouldn't be an 
issue. Here, however, Ajo Way squeezes through Robles Pass. This is real 
Arizona upland, with Saguaros climbing the hills on both sides. But I am 
focused on the cars in front of me. 

Eventually, though, we get beyond the last clump of cyclists and now I am 
the obstacle. One by one, the cars and trucks and suvs that were 
following pass me. And I settle down to an easy 61 miles per hour on the 
flat. 

Trouble is, their isn't much flat. I'm beginning to understand whence the 
designation &quot;Arizona upland.&quot; Every direction seems to be up. With each 
up, Peregrine slows noticeably and even misses from time to time. 
Something is wrong. Not so wrong that I can't keep going, so I keep 
rolling across the Tohono O'odham reservation.

The Tohono O'odham are the descendents of the Hohokam, who built a 
network of canals and a complex civilization in the area of present-day 
Phoenix, then abandoned it around 1450. They are, or were, 
agriculturalists. A surprising amount of the &quot;wild&quot; desert of the Arizona 
upland is the product of their careful cultivation over the centuries. An 
ethnobotanist in Tucson, Gary Paul Nabhan, has written several books on 
the Tohono O'odham and their use of native plants. In _The Desert Smells 
Like Rain_, Nabhan explains that according to the Tohono O'odham system 
of classification, the saguaro are closely related to human beings, and 
distant from other plants. I drive through a landscape peopled by 
saguaro, all standing post over the upland.

Beginning in the 1870s, Anglos also made changes in the upland by grazing 
cattle here. They intoduced new grasses and contributed to areas of 
erosion. The era of grazing on the upland didn't last long, but it left a 
lasting effect.

As I drive along, seemingly ever upward, I am retracing the route 
followed by Kirk Bryan, a Harvard trained geomorphologist, around 1919. 
The United States Geological Survey's water survey issued Bryan a Model T 
Ford, camping equipment, and instruments, and the charge that he identify 
permanent and semi-permanent sources of water in the region. There were 
no macadam roads at the time; what an adventure it must have been. As an 
SUV passes me, I smile to think that on a spectrum between Bryan and Mr. 
SUV, I am marginally closer to Bryan. Too bad the Model T wasn't 
aircooled. 

Peregrine is sluggish up these hills, but she is getting the job done. I 
pat her steering wheel and whisper that she is doing fine, she's a good 
bus. 

What would happen were I to break down here? I know that I should be 
carrying a minimum of five gallons of water, but I'm not. I have maybe 
two. What would I do? As I reflect on this, I wonder if I am not closer 
to Mr. SUV than to Bryan. I am too complacent. Like the camper in the 
commercial who uses his cell phone to complain about the bear outside his 
tent, I expect someone to bail me out if I get into trouble, and to do so 
today.

Luckily, though, I don't break down. After a couple of hours of driving I 
pass through the town of Why (why? why not?) and turn south, fortified 
with new ice and several quart bottles of oil, to Organ Pipe Cactus 
National Monument. As I ride along, I suddenly see an aircooled Vanagon 
Westy passing the other way. Will they wave? They wave! I wave back. 
First VW box I've passed on the road the whole trip.

9. At Organ Pipe

Before long I pull into the monument, pay my fees, and roll back to the 
campground. If the desert is an acquired taste, so too is the campground 
here at Organ Pipe. It has been designed to suit the needs of big RVs. 
Every campsite is a pull-through, with a big concrete pad. But the plus 
side is that when you camp here, you are smack in the middle of the 
desert vegetation. On my site there is a full-grown organ pipe cactus; a 
youthful saguaro that is just beginning to kill its nurse plant, a palo 
verde; a couple ocotillo; several species of cholla cactus (one in 
bloom); some prickly pear; and the usual assortment of white bursage, 
creasote, and brittlebush. If I were any closer to the desert, I would 
have a face full of thorns.

It's about noon, and the air is pleasantly warm -- about 90 degrees. 
There's a breeze. I pop the top and in a moment of inspiration decide to 
remove the ragged canvas, conserving it so that it can be used as a 
pattern later on. Open ever door and window. And suddenly I feel a wave 
of sleepiness. The air is enervating, so I pull out the bed and, leaving 
all the windows hatches and doors open, I go to sleep. I must have slept 
an hour or so -- who knows? After a cup of coffee, I feel restored.

Time to get to work. First I change the dirty oil, taking as much care as 
I can to avoid spilling old oil on the concrete pad. I am not too 
successful; I make a pool of about 1-1/2 square feet in area. I clean 
that up. Next, I will adjust the valves. One by one I find that they do 
indeed need adjustment. They have all tightened up. One by one I back 
them off, find .006, and set the screw. But on one I can't get the feeler 
guage in. No matter how much I back off, the spring continues to release. 
This is bad news. It means I have a broken valve stem -- the likely cause 
of my lack of power and some of the roughness. 

This is a pickle, and I have no one but myself to blame. My lawfirm, 
Bentley, Muir, Haynes and Wilson, all advised me not to reuse my exhaust 
valves. It's one of the few things they all agreed on. But wait, this 
isn't the exhaust valve. It's an intake valve. Even if I had done as I 
was told, I might end up with a bad intake valve stem. I feel relieved, 
even though my objective condition hasn't gotten one bit better.

What to do. I know that I could call Ron Salmon, have him ship me a valve 
by Fedex; call my wife and have her ship the spring compressor and the 
lapping tool and past; drop the engine; fix the valve; and be out of here 
in two days, three at the outside. By I don't wanna. So I try to think 
through the answer to the question: how do you feather a cylinder with a 
bad intake valve, and drive 350 miles? I try to picture what the valve 
must be doing. I know that it is acting independent of the pushrod and 
the rocker, at least largely so. But what's happening at the port? How is 
it opening and closing? I just can't get a clear picture. What I do know 
is that I need to get the spring as close to the position where I 
originally found it as I can. I know at least that I could keep moving, 
albeit with less than full power. Should I disconnect the injector? The 
spark plug? Darn, I just don't know.

There's no point worrying about it. I have already decided not to do the 
right thing; how to do the wrong thing is too ambiguous for my mind to 
process it actively. I decide to relax, have some supper, and put the 
problem on the back burner. Supper is Lipton Noodles Stroganoff, which 
tastes great and hits the spot.

I watch the birds at my campsite. A cactus wren has gotten into her head 
that the bottom side of the bus must harbor lots of tasty bugs. She hops 
&gt;from the pad to each crossmember, does a complete search, hops down, and 
moves to the next crossmember. I wonder if she is finding anything. If 
she is, she welcome to whatever she finds. 

Before long the sun heads down. It is followed by a long, long twilight 
reinforced by a crescent moon, a lot of earthshine on the nightside, and 
Jupiter shining brightly above it. It takes so long for the twilight to 
be extinguished that the sky looks remarkably like an inverted bowl. I 
fancy myself a Hohokam staring at the heavens -- not the heavens of 
Copernicus and Newton, but a more personal heavenly sphere close to my 
head. And then my perspective switches. As it gets darker, I can make out 
a cluster of stars in the constellation Hercules. It's a faint object -- 
you can't even make out Hercules in the city -- but it sure is there. Now 
I'm a modern. And maybe I'm also a little of Kirk Bryan and a little of 
Mr. SUV. Is that so bad? With that thought reverberating in my skull, I 
turn in for another nine hours' sleep.
