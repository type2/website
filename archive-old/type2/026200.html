Yesterday I yanked my 1600 single port expecting the worst and didn't find
it.  The problem: The engine came to me with some aftermarket rockers (blue
with fat shafts and swivel feet) but engine is otherwise stock.  I'd noticed
that there's been a metal to metal sound at idle that seemed to go away
right away above idle.  I first thought this might be the cam followers
rattling but when I pulled the valve covers off I found that the valve
adjusters had peened divots into the valve covers.  So I'm thinking, if I
put another spacer under the rocker I'll have to screw the adjusters in
further to compensate and it won't hit anymore.  Good in theory but not the
answer.  So, over the weekend I asked a mechanic about it and he suggested
the valve seats are receding or the valves are elongating.  But when I
pulled a head off and took one of the valves out I found no evidence of
this, although I didn't actual measure the length of the valve.  The engine
runs very well in spite of this problem so I have my doubts about the
problem being with the cam or followers.  Has anyone had experience with
this style of rocker?  Does it require longer push rods?  Any other ideas?
These heads are reportedly the last set ever done by Dean Lowry before he
died and you'd think, based on his track record that they are high quality,
so I'm stumped.
