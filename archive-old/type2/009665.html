The westie has a trannie problem. I started with 2nd being hard to engage.
Now 2nd won't stay in and when reverse is selected it's fine backing up but
as soon as the clutch is depressed every stops. No grinding noises and it
reverses fine, just don't disengage the clutch fully before selecting
neutral.
I know the trannie has to come out, but any suggestions what to look for
once it's on the floor?

I'd say you have 2 problems (maybe 3):

1. Your clutch is contaminated with something, which means it won't disengage
properly (its either that or the release fork thing).

2. 2nd gear teeth are worn/damaged/broken off. This can cause a gear to jump out.

(3. if 1. is true and it is contaminated then an oil seal has probably gone)

You can check for contamination before the engine is out, if you remove the starter
and poke around inside the bellhousing with a finger, etc. If it's bad, you'll find
gearbox oil in there.

You can check for broken teeth by draining the gearbox oil, the drain plug is
magnetic and they'll more than likely be stuck to that (or metal shavings or
something).
