Subject: Re: [T2] headlight &quot;shades&quot;

George, and other's into the &quot;retro look&quot;

Avoid at all costs the chrome headlamp anti glare sheilds--they rust
like there is no tomorrow--the better ones are stainless, and are redily
available at any finer truck stop---the &quot;Large Cars&quot; use them a lot--

Also beware---

These things radiate a bunch of heat off the headlamp bulbs right back
into the lamp--and the bulbs / filiments life is very short with these
&quot;cool&quot; sheilds.

Been there, done it, got pissed, removed them.

But they still look neat--:&gt;)


Later, 

Terry

Okay, I'm having a senior moment and that's the best description I could
come up with for what I'm seeing here: 
http://www.volks-web_dot_net/bus/kathy_1.jpg 
I SO like the look of these headlight thingies. Anyone know: 
Is the sticky-outy part separate or part of the headlight ring? 
I've seen them both ways. some are part of the ring, some just clamp
underneath. 
What they were stock on, or were they? 
They've been around for years. Probably started in the 50s or earlier.
They became popular with the lowrider homeboys and seem to have crossed
over to the VW crowd. I don't think that any vehicles came stock with
them. 
They tend to draw the attention of law enforcement. Be warned. 
Where I can get some!!! 
Just about any VW chrome provider. 
George
