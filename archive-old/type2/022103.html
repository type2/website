A word on bolting heat exchangers on. I never could get the heat exchangers
to seal to the copper ring gaskets in the exhaust ports. S I took my heat
exchanger and laid it on a perfect flat surface with the exhaust pipes on
the table top. Then I shined a flashlight on the exhaust port/table top
edge and watched from the other side for light leaking through. This
indicated that the exhaust pipes were not flat to the surface they were
being bolted to (the head). Haven't found any that were right the first
time - including some new parts!

I took a long file and filed the pipes together - at the same time - by
filing one port while the other end of the file slides back and forth on
the other pipe. Work one first, then switch, then back to the first, etc. I
work one pipe for several minutes before switching. If reusing old pipes, I
always work the pipes down until I have fresh, uncooked metal - unblackened
- on the edge that seals to the head. No troubles yet on my last rebuild. I
do this to every exhaust gasket surface.

Hope this helps someone....
