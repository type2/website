Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

Shoot, I dunno, but there are huge economies of scale, even in a local production body shop.  I am paying full retail, a one man body shop will get a pretty steep discount, like 20%, imagine what a giant company can manage.  Plus, there is little bodywork that goes on with a new vehicle.  I saw a picture of the microbus production line in 1972 and there were guys doing bodywork on the production line there, BY HAND!  Can you imagine?  How the heck did they ship ~50,000 of these in 1972?

I have found spots on my '72 bus that I am pretty sure were factory bodywork spots.  It appears that they used a metal body filler, maybe lead even.

Your link says 1/2-1/4 of the total cost, that is no doubt, higher even for repair.  Repair steel costs pretty much nothing.

One of the guys in the shop that I am using is from Cuba.  He just visited there and has many very interesting observations.  He says that all materials used in bodywork here are not available in Cuba, that all body repair is done by welding and fabrication.  Cuba has no body filler.  Lots of cars there also have no paint.

&gt;For my curiousity (only) -- when you paint a new car
&gt;in the factory what percentage of the final price
&gt;comes from that?
