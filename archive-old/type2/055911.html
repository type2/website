&gt; I am looking for '56-'60 partition/divider that is between the cab and the cargo area. My bus is a '58 deluxe and would prefer that year. I am in Northern California (San Jose). Or if anyone has any leads on a junker/donor bus that has this and matches the years please contact me.

Are you looking for the piece that goes above the seat, or that the seat
actually rests against?

There are two types for *above* the seat - ambulance dividers and panel
dividers.  Ambulance dividers' are kinda hard to come by, but I bet you
could fab one.  Panel dividers are not as difficult, but why would you
want one in a deluxe?

If its the lower piece, then I suspect your bus is in a bit of a mess.  I
need one off these for my '54, but I know it won't pop up anytime soon, so
I'm  resigned to fixing mine.
