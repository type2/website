Subject: Cheap Front Beam in TX

List:

I just finished talking to a nice guy near Amarillo, TX who has run
out of storage space/time and needs to have someone come and get a
nice '71 front beam.  You pick it up, give him $50.00 and it includes
the trailing arms.  For upgrading earlier busses, I think this is the
first year of disc brakes (not positive). E-mail Richard, not me at

&lt;Drivea69VW_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

No affiliation or kick-back.  Hope someone can help Richard out and
score a nice, rust free front beam for next to nothing and its already
out!

Good luck,
Craig in CO
'78 Westies
