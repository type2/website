Subject: heater blower

I have just installed the blower for the the heat in our 72 bus, restored 
finally after 4 years. I have checked the ground wire from up front and it is 
intact and checked the power wire from the starter it has juice, but fan wont 
kick on. Does the blue wire to terminal A on the relay have power, only when the 
bus is running and if it does then what, oh I also tried a relay from another 
fan but could the relay be shot, and what exactly does the relay do, Im new to 
electrical, thanks. Dylan
