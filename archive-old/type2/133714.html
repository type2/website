Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump on 71 Type II

no not stock. stock is mechanical.
chances are fair that it is not a low pressure pump which it should be.
the typical replacement electric is usually mounted with a block off plate
in the stock pump location.

*****And if the stock location does not have the hole casted then it is 
definately not stock. More like a Type 1 FI case.
