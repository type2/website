Subject: BA6 Relay

Al: 
Me too. I priced them at CDN325.00 and have had no luck locating a used one.
The wire harness is CDN 900.00 dollars new! 

I will gladly take the relay off your hands if you do not feel confident in
trying to fix it. I had some luck taking the relay apart and cleaning all
the contact points. There are basically three sealed &quot;pots&quot; with coils in
them and spring loaded contacts that need to be sanded. You can pop off the
springs and try and access the contacts that way. Carfeul of the tiny wires
though. Perhaps someone can enlighten me on why a relay would stop
functioning and what can be done about it for a long-term fix.


Once again I went to Ark Mirvis who once again tried to steer me clear of
the BA6 imploring me to buy one of his heaters. This guy has chutzpah. He
calls me from NJ, sympathizes with my situation and then tries to sell me
something I don't want.

Speaking of which I have had nothing but trouble from Hayman motors in
Toronto. I have had an order with them for Vanagon parts (including BA6
parts) and have paid for the parts by VISA. After six weeks nothing has
arrived and the owner &quot;Gord&quot; has provided nothing but excuses. I would
strongly recommend that Canadians steer clear of Hayman until they get their
act together.


Cheers - David


 Mounting the BA6 is no easy task since the mounts are not included in
non-equipped Vanagons, though the dimples in the sheet metal are clearly marked,
