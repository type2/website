Subject: Re: [T2] Starter current and clutch cable

&gt; I think what's more likely is the best path to ground for whatever reason
&gt; was the clutch cable and the current snapped it. Right?

The clutch cable should be at ground as well. Maybe if the strap wasn't
well-connected, the clutch cable would become the ground. But I still don't
see how the current would make the cable snap. Maybe the cable was heating up
during starts, but that still doesn't seem likely. The accelerator cable would
also be working as a ground... The rubber cover over the strap is to keep dirt
out and reduce corrosion - not electrical insualation as EVERYTHING around is
at the same potential (ground)
