Subject: [T2] rear seal removal and installation


&gt; So how do you remove the reseal and then replace it?  Where does the
flywheel
&gt; O ring go?  I need some help here.    78 westy....

I assume you mean the front seal, the one by the flywheel.  The rear seal is
the one at the other end of the crankshaft, near the fan.  Though, the
technique for removing and replacing the two seals is exactly the same.

You carefully pry the old seal out.  The best and easiest thing to use is a
&quot;seal puller&quot; which kind of looks like a thin-headed hammer with different
sized hooks on each end of the &quot;head.&quot;  A small regular hammer will
sometimes fit, some people use screwdrivers, etc.  Be sure not to scar up
the sealing surface or the case itself.

Replacing the seal is real easy, after you've done a few dozen or so.
Basically, you tap it back into the case.  The trick is to not &quot;cock&quot; it in
its bore; you just go 'round and 'round with your smallest hammer smoothly
and gently easing it into its final position.  I use a real big heavy washer
on the face of the seal and a small tack hammer and &quot;tap, tap, tap&quot; around
and around until it's flush.  A little oil on the outside diameter of the
seal can help here.

The flywheel O-ring goes in front of the seal (F is F) around the &quot;shaft&quot; of
the flywheel that faces the engine.  As I recall (it's been a while) there's
a groove there that takes the ring.

&gt; Looked around at the local discount import flaps and found a round disk
that
&gt; is a rear seal installer?  what is that? and do I need it?

There's some devices that make it easier, in theory, to install oil seals.
I've never used one so I can't comment if that's true or not.  I'll bet more
seals have been installed without such a tool than with one.  Again, don't
get the seal cocked in its bore.  Light taps that keep the seal square with
the bore will do the trick.  An experience mechanic will tap one in in less
than a minute while less-experienced mechanics - like me - will take several
minutes to get it in place.
