Subject: [T2] *&amp;(%!! vandals smashed the side window on my Westy.

&gt;&gt;Any tricks to replacing the drivers side rear window
 (behind the little vent one) on my 79 Westy?&lt;&lt;

yes. do yourself a favor &amp; just get a one-piece glass like is on the
other side.  the seal is cheaper &amp; you won't have
any rust issues with the little vent wing window.

just MHO.
