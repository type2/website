Eric and the List,

Your '73 sounds very much like my '72.  I really don't know what the
original interior was.  It could have been from a Westy, but there is really
know way for me to be sure.  The interior that I got from a '75 Westy will
fit very nicely.  Mine also has the two vents in the top.  The &quot;canvass&quot; is
a vinyl material with no screens.  It is in pretty good shape after all
these years.  Mine started life as a Station wagon rather than a Kombi, like
Wesphalia used.  Please p-mail me and I will send you a picture so you can
see if yours and mine are similar.  When I got this bus a year and a half
ago, I posted to the list about it but no one responded who had ever seen or
heard of a &quot;Hanover&quot; conversion.  Mine was definitely made in B.C.
