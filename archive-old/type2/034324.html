No, what you do is get out, get a business card out (NOT YOUR OWN!!!) and
write the following.  &quot;The people who saw me scratch the hood of your shiney
new car think that I'm leaving a note with my name and address.  I'm not!&quot;
Slide it under the wiper blade and slink off.  (Watching your backside, 'cause
your kharma, sure as hell, is gonna get you.)

An aside...  Many years ago, my SO was leaving work and scraped the bumper of
the car next to her with the cheesy plastic end of the Vanagon's bumper. 
Popped the end off.  She got out and looked for damage.  Saw none except the
Vanagon's bumper cap.  Picked it up and continued on her way.

Later that same day, while she was at the movies with the kids, someone did
the same thing with their front bumper.  From wheelwell to wheelwell all the
way down the passenger side.  Pushed a crease into the sliding door 2-3&quot; deep.

Kharma, my friends, kharma.
