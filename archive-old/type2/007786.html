&gt; &gt;We're turning to the list for help - does anyone know where we can
find
&gt; &gt;the steering box?  He's not particularly gung ho on the idea of
using a
&gt; &gt;used one.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Rocky Mountain Motorworks lists rebuilt ones in their
catalog but
&gt; they are kind of expensive.  I believe there are other sources, too,
but I
&gt; can't remember offhand.  You might try looking at some of the ads in
VW
&gt; magazines.

Bus Depot lists it at $290.  Sure that you don't want to look for a
used one?
