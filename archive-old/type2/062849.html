&lt;&lt; Basically all this bitching about &quot;decimated&quot; VWs sounds alot like a &quot;I
 got mine so screw everyone else&quot; to me, and I don't want this list
 polluted with that.  If some deadhead buys a VW, you can be sure it's
 because he loves it, and I have yet to meet someone that drives a bus that
 doesn't feel the same way.  I think the fears of people buying a bus then
 throwing it away are unfounded. &gt;&gt;

Hold on there pardner...don't fly off the handle just yet.  Most enthusiasts
LOVE have new folks join the flock, rich or poor, old or young, foriegn or
domestic.  The problem is those folks who buy the bus not to buy a bus, but
to fit into part of an image.  Those are the folks who end up &quot;trashing&quot;
them.  (Trashing means abusing and neglecting, it does not necessarily mean
not restoring to stock)
