&gt;&gt;	I am thinking of doing a wood interior for my 71 bay window bus. Does 
&gt;&gt;anyone have any clues where I can start.

&gt;I dont know anything about it personally, although my interests have been 
&gt;perked as of late ...
&gt;
&gt;I dont want to volunteer this guy to help you, I don't even know him, but 
&gt;I'm pretty sure he's a list member and maybe he's willing to give you a 
&gt;pointer.  Check out his bus:
