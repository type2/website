&gt;&gt; The rep. had a broad array of their VW-specific publications there,
&gt;&gt; including some of their CD-ROMS of repair manuals.  Apparently they intend
&gt;&gt; to publish the CD-ROMS for most [maybe all] of their traditional manuals.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, please, PLEASE tell me this Bentley CD-ROM line is going to be
&gt; cross-platform!

Let's all visit their website and send e-mails to there marketing department
letting them know what we WANT these on CD with color wiring diagrams.

PS someone please send this to RAMVA.
