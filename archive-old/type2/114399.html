Subject: RE: [T2] Some clutch questions:

If money is an issue, it would probably be better for you to purchase a
balanced counter-weighted crankshaft
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1185 than to send
your current stuff out to be dynamically balanced. I believe that a
statically balanced set-up with a new counterweighted crank will be
better than a dynamically balanced set-up with non-counterweighted OEM
crank.

-----Original Message-----
I was not going to have the rotating mass balanced as this will be a
stock
engine (rev limit 4000 rpm and standard crank), the nearest VW balance
shop is
Raby's in GA, and I need to get the engine out of the kitchen and in the
vehicle
within the next month.
