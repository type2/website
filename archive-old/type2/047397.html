Also, make sure the bolts aren't bottoming out on the studs - in other
words, be sure there is enough thread sticking out beyond the header
flange to torque the pipes down enough.  I had this happen this past
weekend.  I had the flanges re-welded around the header pipe, and in
grinding down the excess weld made the flange just a bit thinner (wow,
did I grind it THAT much?).  This caused the bolt to hit the unthreaded
part of the stud before the pipe was snug to the head.  I added a few
flat washers between the bolt and the flange to compensate (in addition
to flat-filing the faces of the flange mating to the head).  Jeez did it
ever sound awful when it was leaking like that.  

And for what it's worth, I saw that the stud lengths differed between my
heads (one looks newer) - the one I had this problem on had longer
studs.  I think this magnified the results of the grinding.

Oh yeah, and thanks to all for the advice on replacing exhaust studs - I
ended up replacing only 2; I couldn't get any of the others out and
decided that my attempts were testimonials to their strength.  Still
have to adjust the heater cables at the flappers before I can tell if my
heat passes the emissions test or not.

&gt; 
&gt; Help,
&gt; 
&gt;     I just put on some new heater boxes that i purchased from Nikki Elco and
&gt; they aren't sitting right against the engine.  I think my old studs that
&gt; come out of the engine may have been bent and are holding the heater box
&gt; from fitting exactly up against the engine.  I can feel air shooting out
&gt; from around the exausht manifold.  I think i am going to replace the old
&gt; studs and get new gaskets.  Does anyone have any tips for me or help.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the second time i put these guys on and it is worse instead of
&gt; better. If someone knows of the best place to get the studs and gaskets i
&gt; would really appreciate it.
