&gt;I was thinking of putting a ragtop in my '58 Bus. First how hard is that.
&gt;Second the Bus has dual cargo doors( cargo doors on the passanger and 
&gt;driver side). Being that the bus is a &quot;Unibody design&quot; how well would 
&gt;the bus hold up with a sunroof on it? 

All sunroof and double-door busses had the &quot;belly pan&quot; second floor, so you
should
be OK, since you already have one.  I've been meaning to add one to mine
someday...

&gt;Another side question, how many of the dual cargo door buses were made? 

who knows...
