Hi Volks!

    I just pulled my engine out of my 1979 Transporter, to have it
rebuilt. This is the first time working on a bus, and I decided to
replace all of the fuel lines while the engine is out. How much fuel
line do I need to do this? Can you still get the one that goes on the
filler neck, and if so where? Can you put a mechanical fuel pump on a
2.0l FI pancake motor? Whats better a mechanical or eletric fuel pump? I
have a eletric fuel pump now, but not sure if it works. Anything else I
should do, or check while the engine is out?

Any information will be helpful!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
79 Transporter
