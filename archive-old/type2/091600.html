Subject: RE: [T2] Head temperature sensor headache

Hello,

Thanks for the replies. I am not sure what the sensor
goes to. I assumes that it went with the f.i. but I am
not sure. I will just go ahead and order the correct
Bosch replacement part. I was hoping that all these
sensors would be similar enough to be interchangable.
Oh well, Thanks again for the advice!

&gt; I havent worked with a 914 2L, but if it is fuel
&gt; injected that sensor is
&gt; important for the injection. It controlls the warmup
&gt; encrichment and so
&gt; on. Personally I would get the correct part and not
&gt; one that Just looks
&gt; correct. Then again this is just my $.02.
