Subject: Re: Air Conditioning

&gt; As I was driving around earlier (116* today) I was wondering if any later 
&gt; model &quot;loafs&quot;  ('72-'79) ever had Air Conditioners.
&gt; 
&gt; If they did, are they effective?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever tried to retrofit one?

In my Bentley manual it says some transports were equiped with auxilary 
heaters and air conditioners by the factory. I know they've been 
retrofited, but as far as the factory ones, I'm notr sure how well they 
worked, but with my VW experience they must have been decent with lots of 
room for improvement. By the way can anyone tell me if it would be better 
in the long run to use an electric or engine driven AC in a bus? Thanks.
