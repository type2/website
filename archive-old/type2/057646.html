&gt;
&gt;Have just spent some time in taking the side windows out of my bus and
taking the channels mostly down to bare metal.  but still have a couple of
areas with a little rust - but not through anywhere.  Is POR-15 too thick
to be used in this area?  If so, what's a good product to use in this area?
