Subject: Re: brakes

you betcha !!! if it's crud that's holding back 1300 psi
pressure from leaking, you better!
seriously, get to the library and learn about your brakes. 
this is not so much for your benefit as it is for mine,
i might be stopped at a red light some day w/ you in my
rear view mirror !
