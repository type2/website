All the references I've seen say that the dual vacuum distributor should
be timed at 5 degrees ATDC with a timing light and the engine running and
the hose attached.  Static timing it to 5ATDC results in a very retarded
condition (voice of experience here!)

I'm still trying to figure out where I stashed my timing light so I can
set it up right.  I also want to check total advance.
