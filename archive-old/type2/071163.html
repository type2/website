&lt;&lt; Could this be related to the tranny shaft coming out of the 
tranny last time I pulled the engine.   (Exellent clutch disk 
centering tool!) That time I just pushed it back in  and everything 
worked fine that way.  Some vauge memories from an erlier
tranny opening tells me this shaft also was related to a gear in 
the  differential housing that could have something to do with the 
reverse gear. &gt;&gt;

Yes, it sure can!  If the snap ring on the input shaft that holds 
the coupler (with its external teeth for the reverse idler gear shaft) 
pops loose, then the coupler can push up the input shaft.  If it
does so then the teeth no longer contact the matching gear on
the reverse idler gear shaft and, Viola!, no more reverse!
