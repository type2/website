Presumable you have tested the vacuum advance - suck on the tube and see if 
the points move, put your tounge on the tube to see if the points remain 
advanced, release the vacuum to see if the points return. If they are stiff
squirt in some WD40 and try again.

If the vacuum is shot then it seams to me you have 4 ways to go...

1.  Lots of dosh for a new vacuum &amp; centrifugal distributor, but is it worth 
    $500!!!

2.  Visit your scrap yard and pick one up for a few dollars

3.  Replace with a 009 - UK price equivalent to $90 US

4.  Buy a new vacuum advance unit to fit to old distributor - UK price 
    equivalent to $25 US. I can let you have a mail order address if you like, 
    but they should be availlable in the states.
