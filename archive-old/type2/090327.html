Subject: Vanagon block into a bay (was: vanagon seats &amp; more)

David, David, and Rob (is that law firm or what? :-)

I have a vanagon short block running in the '73 right now.  As Dave
Wolfanger said, it requires a pretty total accesory flop and you wind up
with two dipsticks, but the only major dif was that the engine hanger
mount bolts on the Vanagon block were bigger (m10 vs. m8?) as David
Schwarze said.  I had no trouble with the shroud meeting the case at all.
This was an '80 case, for the record.  Maybe they changed the casting in
81 or 82?
