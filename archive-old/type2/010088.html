In my last episode, I brought Peregrine back from Live Oak Springs on the 
back of a flatbed. Her breakdown was caused by (1) lost keepers on an 
intake valve stem, (2) a ruptured dipstick bellows, and (3) very loose 
heads. Since late April the bus has been sitting, waiting for me to 
forsake the Hamlet routine and take action.

My dear wife, tired of my pacing at all hours of the night and mumbling 
&quot;to rebuild or not to rebuild,&quot; asked how much I thought it would cost to 
get the bus back on the road. I told her $800 for the top end and $400 
for miscellaneous. &quot;Make it so,&quot; said she.

First I tried to order AVP heads through Ron, but he kindly gave me their 
number to check availability, and they said 10 days. So I called MSHP and 
ordered their heads, pistons, and cylinders. These just arrived, and they 
look great.

Meanwhile, I have been finishing the cabinets for the camper, giving the 
spar varnish a French-rub treatment -- at least five coats on each piece.

And I have been scouting the junkyards for miscellaneous. Today I came 
away with a child's cot for $10!

Okay, a question or two. First, should I really disassemble the Mark 
Stephens heads, wash them, and put them back together? I would rather 
leave well enough alone if I can. Second, is it the case that on a '76 
there is one copper exhaust ring peened to each port, and another loose 
(between the peened ring and the manifold)?
