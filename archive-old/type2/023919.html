Subject: Exhaust stud hole repair
Date: Wed, 14 Feb 2001 14:24:21 -0500

Greetings,
     My '72, 1700 engine is missing several exhaust studs (head to heat
exchanger).  There was a recent post about someone using the Big-Sert
inserts ( www.timesert_dot_com/bigsert.htm ).  The 8mm stud kit comes standard
with 11.7mm inserts.  If you request it, they will substitute the 16.2mm
inserts.  My question to the list:  Which length inserts should I get?  The
person that posted about using them installed the 11.7mm inserts, but thinks
the 16.2mm would work.  There is a concern that you might have to drill the
stud hole just a bit deeper to use the 16.2mm studs.  Would drilling deeper
cause any problems?

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
