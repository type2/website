Subject: bay window market crash?

This time a year ago, we were trying to find a bus to buy and 
use on our cross country trip.  At that time, bay windows 
seemed to move fast on thesamba_dot_com, and a really pristine 
non-Westy bay went for 8k.  Now, a bus like that won't sell for 
5k and nothing seems to be moving.

We felt fortunate to get our sunroof bus with freshly 
remanned engine and fully functional systems (but no show 
winner) for 5k.  We now have it on thesamba, though, and 
haven't had much interest even at 4k, despite the 1k of quality 
work we've put into it.  What gives in the bus market?  Is it 
fuel prices, economic conditions, or are the bays--as we 
found on our trip--just drifting out of the public 
conciousness?

After all of that, if anyone wants to buy our bus and take off 
camping the country, make us an offer, ANY offer :-)
