&gt; HI Bus people,
&gt;    I'm tryin' to find the VIN on my '69 Westy.  Haven't looked extensively,
&gt; but I am about to get inspected, and they will not be able to find it
&gt; either.  SO where is it?  

On my '69 (US) its right at the bottom of the dash panel in front of the
driver. Standing at the front of the van,  on the driver's side, facing
the rear, look at the very bottom of your windshield. See  the little
metal tag rivited in place at the bottom edge of the dash panel. That's
it.


&gt;       Drive On,  Chris  '69, '71 Westys and assorted bugs.
