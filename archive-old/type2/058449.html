I've been reading with interest the recent posts on carb jetting.  I've looked
everywhere I could to try to get more info before posting, but with no luck.

1980 Westy, 2.0L, rebuilt but box stock, dual Weber 34ict's.  130 mains, 170
air, 40 (that other vertical jet in the fuel bowl).  I had been running 125
mains, but recent posts persuaded me to go to the biggest I had on hand.  They
seemed OK, though.

Please help me jet this properly before I break down &amp; get a single
progressive.  I've spent a lot of  time getting this thing road worthy (if not
eye worthy) and would appreciate any input from your experience.  Thank you
very much.

PS I've got FI parts for the 1980 2.0L if anyone needs anything.
