Subject: Re: [T2] choking fuel injected  Westy

&gt;  my bus started to kind of choke now and then.
&gt; It seemed exactly like it wouldn't fire for a second, and then pick up
and
&gt; keep on going... As I drove it started to get worse and that's about the
&gt; time I pulled over and slept for the night...Anyhow, the next morning it
&gt; wouldn't start--seems very much like it's not getting gas. t

And if it's not the temp sensor, it might be the dreaded &quot;pieces of rotten
rubber or other junk in your fuel tank obstructing the fuel flow&quot; syndrome
that is very common in old buses. Pulling the fuel tank (which generally
means also pulling the engine) and cleaning it out will solve the problem.
Fuel filter could be fine and you could still have a piece of some larger
debris in your tank that occasionally floats down on the fuel outlet hole
and starves you for fuel. Old rubber fuel neck restrictors and other
hardware tend to get old and drop pieces into the gas tank.

Definitely try the temp sensor trick first. If that's the problem, it's a
much quicker fix.

Good luck,
