&gt; Yeah, I was thinking of just that when I sent my message, but since it's
&gt; being pressed until it stops at a &quot;ledge&quot;, I don't think it would be
&gt; susceptible to this kind of problem.  But yeah, I could see how this
&gt; could be a problem in other applications!


I put my races in a plastic bag and put them in the freezer the night
before I need to use em.  get everything ready, go get one and quickly
slide it in,  work fast but it has always just slid right in.
