Subject: Re: [T2] Flat cam/AVP quality? (longer)

Hello All   Let me put in my 30 years of  VW workings here. You never mix 
match lifters and cams . even if you are doing a patch job you always put the 
lifter back in the same hole it came from. these things will wear a pattern 
that will only match the lobe it has been riding on. I have seen mixed match 
lifters wear all the way till nothing was left. As for solid verus hydlics 
solids give more power , more hassles also. hyldrlics work fine less power 
less hassles also. best thing you can do to a Porsche 914 as adjusting the 
valves on these badies are a PITA.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem
