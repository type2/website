Subject: a/c long overdue everybus post.

I need to pipe in on the a/c.  We have a '78 bus that has showroom a/c. 
Last year it worked great, better then the heat.  But last year the belt
broke.  We had it replaced but within a couple weeks it broke again. 
Now or mechanic says that the problem is that the housing of the
compressor has two ears that are broken off.  These ears hold the belt
in place.  He recommends a new compressor even though the mechanic of
the compressor work fine.  Anyone out there with a good compressor ar
thinks that they can weld the housing on ours.

Now a long overdue everybus post.

I am the guy who was playing the Yamaha guitar late at night at the
pavilion.  I an sorry that I am so bad with names but I didn't know that
I was in the presence of the list administrator.  I am humbled.
Many of you met my son even if you didn't meet me.  He was the one
selling colored dinosaur pictures four 1 dollars or five pennies if you
didn't have it.   At one point he had his little sister and some other
kid working for him while he was just selling the pictures.

Anyway I told my father this story the nest day we got home.  He thought
this was utterly hilarious and told every one about it, laughing so hard
that he almost fell over.  Sadly my father died the next day suddenly
but not totally unexpectedly, so thank you everybus for giving that
happiness.
Our make shift paint job was awesome, we made everyone we passed happy
by driving our bus.  Everyone honked and waved and ran over.  When we
stopped for lunch some Shenandohah woman came running over and offered
to buy it.  So thanks Danielle for that fabulous painting.  By the way,
when are we going to figure out the words to &quot;Love is a Rose&quot;.
If anyone is interested can give more details of our adventures and
pictures someday.
