yes

&gt; The duct work can be removed all over. The heater boxes can be replaced 
&gt; with simple pipes. You'll need to seal any holes in the tin that leads from 
&gt; the top of the engine to under the engine so you do recirculate heated air.

right I did this several years ago on my 78 (use gas heater exclusively)

&gt; If you remove the heater boxes plug the air outlets on the bottom of the 
&gt; fan shroud.

very important

&gt; All the flapper boxes can come off.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the flat plates between the heater boxes and block need to stay to 
&gt; keep road spray (wet roads) off of the engine.

I removed these flat plates and other than the risk with the push rod
tubes exposed I have seen no other effect.  if I were on a road that bad I
would have a skid plate to protect the whole bottom of the engine
