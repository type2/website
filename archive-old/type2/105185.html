Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning a 2L in a vanagon

&gt;The quest continues for a good running clean van and I figure the best place
&gt;to start cleaning is the motor.  So my question is do I just wrap up the Alt,
&gt;coil and ecu and get some engine degreaser and have at it with the hose?  At
&gt;home so when it does not start I don't get stuck somewhere.  Will the water
&gt;properly drain?  Is it easy to take the tin off the motor in the van to be
&gt;able to really get in there?  I was thinking about some POR Marine clean
&gt;anybody have any insight for me?

I seal up the engine openings, remove all the tin and bolt on stuff (down 
to a long block) and then take it to the car wash.

The outside gets clean, inside stays dry.

Take it home, remove whatever you sealed engine with and put some light oil 
inside the cylinders to keep them free.
