Subject: Bad ges smell won't go away.

Hello, I just purchased a 1982 Vanagon camper and the good news is I am so happy I bought it.  I can tell it's going to be a great vehicle and it's great all the web support.  The problem is I can't really drive it.  Here is the chain of events.  About two weeks ago I bought it, filled it up with gas, and drove it 30 miles to my house, making 2 stops along the way.  No problems at all.  The next morning I go into the van, it smells terribly of gasoline.  I think there must be a fuel leak near the top of the tank so I drive it a bit to air it out.  There are gas fumes coming from the heater.  I think okay, it just has to evaporate from under there. I wait, letting it idle to clean out the heater duct.  It won't go away.  I have searched for leaks and found none.  Since that first day the van only smells of gas when I am running the engine and the smell is coming from the heaters.  When I crawl around under the van I cannot smell gas.  How would the smell get into the heater duct and
 why would it stay there?  It is a gasoline smell and not an exhaust smell.  There is a heater booster in the van, but I don't think it works, could that have something to do with it?  If my heat smells like gas are the only possibilities something around the fuel tank?  I don't really mind taking off the fuel tank if I can be relatively sure the problem is in there somewhere.  This is killing me, please help.  Thank you in advance.
