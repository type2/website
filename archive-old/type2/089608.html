&gt;Subject: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left wheel
&gt;came off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the powdercoating on the wheels caused the lug bolt to lose torque some 4000 &gt;miles after the wheels lug bolts had been properly torqued on.   when the &gt;wheel came off, the bus pulled to the left.  the right rear tire was &gt;scrubbed off of the rim and the rim dug into the asphalt.  the cloud of &gt;dust that Sean saw was pulverized rock from the pavement. the bus then &gt;hit hard on the passenger side and rolled two and one quarter times.  it &gt;finally cane to rest pointing back toward the direction the we came from &gt;in the southbound lane (we had been heading northbound).&quot;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Check that torque!
