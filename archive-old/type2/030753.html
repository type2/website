Pulling into my driveway this morning, I noticed that my neighbor, who I
hadn't met yet, was cleaning out his garage, and had two of those big
beautiful red four foot tall rolling toolboxes...

Needless to say I went and introduced myself! Turns out he rebuilds
hotrods. He sounds like more of an American car kinda guy, although he
came right over and said OK, well, we can do this, and this, and this...
and he seems more than willing to help me out, &quot;any time you see the
garage open, drop by, bring some beer, we'll get this thing rolling for
you.&quot; YAY!

He also mentioned that he has a friend that does nothing BUT VWs. YAYAYAY!
He said that his friend dropped out the engine from a bus, sprayed the
inside with fire retardant, and then painted right over it. This sounds
pretty good to me, anyone else have any input?

Kate and Skutter, about to get a new lease on life
