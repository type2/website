-&gt;I just got one from Just Kampers in UK. Genuine VW NOS for 12.5 pounds,
but
&gt;I don't know if this is local for you.


A follow up here. The catalogue price is 22.50. I just checked my receipt
and actually got charged 12.70 for some reason, perhaps because it was a
tiny bit rusty - it is NOS though.

Just Kampers is 044 1252 371331 or fax 372490 from overseas
