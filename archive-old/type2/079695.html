Subject: Re: [T2] H4 Conversion kits

Generally, they are not DOT legal because back then they required the
reflector to be sealed.  There were a few H4 lights that were DOT legal
because they built a glass bulb around the H4 bulb inside the light.  I
think that they were marketed under the &quot;Bobi&quot; name.

I've never been hassled for my H4 lights.  Unless you have nasty
inspectors you have little to worry about if they are aimed properly.
