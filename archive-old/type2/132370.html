Subject: Re: [T2] Is new fuel line the right stuff?

&gt; Ordered some new fuel line for my 80 Westy. It's supposed to be the high
&gt; pressure fuel injected stuff. Its been years since I've seen the original
&gt; looking externally braided stuff so I'm not remembering what this should look
&gt; like. The markings on the hose are &quot;COHLINE 21220600-22-5X12.5-NBR-25/03 DIN
&gt; 73379-B&quot; I cant be sure all the numbers are correct, it's hard to read this
&gt; stuff printed on the cloth braid. Measured the inside diameter and compared to
&gt; some internally re-enforced line I got for my 75 a while ago, same
&gt; dimensions.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have experience with this brand or part number?

The braided hose is what the local repair shops seem to use.

The fiche says to use N 020 281 1 (7x3mm) hose but two hose sizes seem to be
offered interchangeably:

- a braided hi pressure hose (N 020 357 1). The Continental version of this
hose that I've seen is actually 7x2.5mm in measurement. I've used it for the
fuel breather lines behind the firewall. It's a very very tight fit on the
fuel rail and I don't recommend using it there.

- the smooth covered high pressure hose (N 020 281 1) from Continental is
7x3mm just like the fiche. I've fit this one to the various barbs on the
fuel rail and it fits perfect (could be tighter on the cold start valve but
the barbs are smaller and that's what hose clamps are for).

&gt; Is this the right
&gt; stuff? Any tips on keeping the braid from fraying? Thinking about a touch of
&gt; clear fingernail polish.

You might also try &quot;fray stop&quot; from the fabric store. It dries and stays
flexible.
