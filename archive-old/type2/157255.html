Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

&gt; The oil light is pressure, not level.  While,
&gt; obviously, if you have no oil you will have no

&gt; mean you will have a marginal amount of oil
&gt; pressure.  
&gt; 
&gt; My last T4 oil light flickered when I took it up
&gt; mountains (heating it up) and had too thin oil
&gt; (10w30) that persumably sheared under the heat. 
&gt; I went to thicker oil, no problem.  If I were in
&gt; your boat, I'd be looking at overheating
&gt; (cooling, fuel, and tuning) or other pressure
&gt; problems more than the amount of oil. 

Glad you added this. That is actually the direction I
was going when I replied earlier - but I forgot
mid-stream! Gettin' old! -BaH
