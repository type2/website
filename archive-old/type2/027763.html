May I offer an alternative reason for always connecting the ground cable 
last, or disconnecting it first:
If you are putting a wrench on the positive terminal and the negative 
terminal is already grounded, then if your wrench should happen to touch any 
metallic part on the car you will get an enormous instantaneous current 
throught the wrench that will burn your hand. This is particularly the case 
in the VW van where the battery compartment is shrouded by body panels. The 
alternative explanation that was offered is not correct; you will also get a 
spark if you remove the ground cable first, but that shouldn't happen in any 
case if you aren't drawing any significant current thru the battery when you 
disconnect either post.
