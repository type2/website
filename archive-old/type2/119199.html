Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

I'll add a couple things I havn't seen yet. My perfect bus/Westy would be a
late '70's model with a few changes:
*2.0ltr FI with 72-74 exhaust system.
*have the later interior cabinets for sure.
*Gas filler door as on the '72-'74?
*removeable rear apron to make engine pulling simpler
*A 3-way fridge would be nice also.

As for the plaid upholstery, I love it. Mine is the Dakota Beige color
though so its not quite as &quot;loud&quot; as some of the other color combos. I just
recovered all the back pads with some perfect upper bunk material and it
looks great! Even had some extra to make some  prototype Westy plaid accent
pillows for the back bench.
Rarest of the rare ; )

&gt;
&gt; Say the list hit the last lottery...What would the &quot;reasonably perfect&quot;
&gt; bus have? Answers limited to stuff on 68-79 only, mix 'n match your
&gt; features/deletions...(Doktor Tim not eligible since each bus was per-
&gt; fect when it left Germany and only imperfect owners ruined them... ;-(
