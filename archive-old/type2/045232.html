Well, there is a tool for this...tubing bender. Has two handles, one fixed to 
a circular mandrel, the other movable with a roller or solid former that 
actually forces and guides the tubing around the mandrel.

You buy a single one for the diameter of tubing and radius of bend that you 
want, or a more expensive set that has mandrels for most common diameters and 
radii.

For brake line, a 1/4&quot; diameter, 1&quot; radius tool will do anything you need, 
though some bends might not be ideal for their locations.

I haven't looked, but I'd think that Harbor Freight would sell them. Quality 
should be good enough for at least one complete brake refit job.
