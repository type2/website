You said,&quot;
I have recently acquired a bn4 heater but the fuel pump doesn't sound =
like it=20
runs when I connect a battery source, also I would like to bench test =
this=20
before installing it. What kind of fuel pump can I get for it, I looked =
at=20
the aftermarket electrics at napa for about 20 bucks they said they are =
low=20
pressure. thanks and  keep vdubbing&quot;

I say,&quot;
         You can not use a &quot;:regular&quot; fuel pump for the heater. The BN4 =
pump &quot;runs&quot;
by recieving pulses or shots of 12vdc by the way of points on the heater =
fan shaft.
 If your BN4 pump is working and you are teating it,you will only hear =
one &quot;click&quot; with 12 vdc applied . Someone tell me if I'm wrong.

      On the subject that the BN4 shuts down ( fire only ,not fan) I =
have this prob on mine. The coil spring on the temp regulating switch =
expands too rapidly making contact and shuting off the heater untill it =
cools down by contracting.
Has anyone succesfully shortened or adjusted this spring to give longer =
run times?
I may give this a try in the next few weeks.&quot;
