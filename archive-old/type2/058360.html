&gt; hum.....what way IS the best way then , i was searching for a
isolater today
&gt; and all but one rv shop knew what i was talking baout and thery only
have the
&gt; 70 amp ones, and i think mine is only 50 amps, (72) am i right about
this?
&gt; and can i connect 2 batterys in series? will that work, and how
effictive is
&gt; it?

It will effectively give you 24 volts, which will distress your
electrical components greatly!

What you want is the batteries in _parallel_.  Positive is connected
to positive, negative to negative.

The best way I've found to do this is with a simple battery isolation
relay.  This is a relay that connects the positive terminals of the
batteries together only when the ignition is on.  This way, both
batteries get charged, but only the camper battery is used when the
engine is off.

I, too have had bad experiences with the &quot;solid state isolators&quot;. 
These are really just big diodes that allow the power to flow only
from generator to the batteries, but they seem to have a finite life. 
The finning on their housings leads me to believe that they are not
too efficient either, and the heat produced probably leads to their
demise.

Let us know how it goes!
