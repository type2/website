Yup, Karl, it should.  The danger of typing at 1:30 in the morning :-)

And I wasn't even trying to comments on the years.  I should have stuck
to &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late.&quot;  The mention of a heat exchanger with exhaust ports
implied to me the early box, which has the integral manifold, as opposed
to the late box which has the U-turn pipe and separate manifold.
