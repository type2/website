Subject: Cleaning cylinders and heads while eng. in situ...
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Anybody out there have any suggestions as to how one might go about cleaning 
the cylinder cooling fins and cylinder heads while the engine is still in 
place? Replaced my oil cooler and seals about two months ago, but the Westy 
is still running a bit too hot, according to list wisdom ( stock 2.0L ' 78 
FI, running at 235-250deg. sending unit in drain plug, VDO gauges, at 65mph[ 
3400rpm] on 90-100deg. days, 35-80% rel. humidity, _at_ sea level to 700-1500 
above.) Pulled the tinware under the pushrod tubes, and it is obvious that 
111,000mi. of accumulated crud is probably the culprit. Was hoping to find a 
way to do this without pulling the eng., as other than a slight over-hot 
condition during the summer months, it runs well. Any tips?
Thanks,
Robb
