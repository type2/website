Sorry can't help you, I've only been here a short while and wondering the
same myself.  

Do you know if there is any kind of organization of VW clubs, lists etc. here?

There's a swap in Slough in November that may be good from what I hear.
Otherwise if you're really into finding something nice I would suggest
buying one from Parts is Parts.  They actually have broken down racks to
ship.  Very nice and exactly matching VW wood racks.
