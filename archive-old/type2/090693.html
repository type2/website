Subject: Re: [T2] painting question

By all means, if you have value to receive from 6 jobs, it would be well 
worth the investment in a descent HVLP packaged system, like Eastwood 
sells. Start with the least important vehicle and develop your initial 
skills and procedures. Do a couple more improving your techniques and 
skills.

I'd like to get a betting pool started on this .............. most people
only want to paint one car in a lifetime.
