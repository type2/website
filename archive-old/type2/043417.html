Subject: O'Leno / Ichetucknee (FL US) campout/float this weekend

Hi gang:

Just a reminder that the Love Bug campout is still on for this weekend. 
I think most folks will be there Friday through Sunday (O'Leno State
Park near High Springs -
http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/District_2/oleno/index.html).

Ray Hale of G'ville has volunteered to check us all in early on Friday
so we're more likely to get better sites together, so please advise if
you have a reservation &amp; want to get in on that.

I'm planning to take my kids on a float down the Ichetucknee River on
Saturday EARLY A.M.  (I'm a late sleeper so I have to emphasize the
early part.)  I plan to be in line at the north entrance by 7:30 AM and
the tentative plan is to float down to the lower parking lot, eat
sandwiches, and perhaps float a second time after lunch.  If you're
interested in the river float but aren't familiar with the process,
study http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/District_2/Ichetucknee/index.html
or send me a note.

Even if you're not interested in the river float, I hope you can make
the trip!  Should be at least a couple of diehard bus-heads there.

joe
