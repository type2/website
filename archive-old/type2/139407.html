Subject: Re: [T2] Chat about Richard Atwell's restoration

Maybe there's no need for a special session. That's really up to 
Richard I think. An example of the kind of question I run into when 
looking at his site is this one. Under the picture of the bead-blasted 
fan shroud, he says it was bean blasted (duh!). But then he says 
somewhere that you can clean up a shroud with a stainless steel brush, 
but not a brass brush. So my question is, does the stainless steel 
brush do just as good a job as bead blasting? Dry or with Simple Green?

So many questions I'd never thought to ask before reading his site.

&gt; them, they'll be in the archives, and he can add more info to the FAQ
&gt; as he sees repeated questions.
