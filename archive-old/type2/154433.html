Subject: Vanco 8 Winter tire life?

So, I'm thinking these Laredo's are underrated for my Westy, so I'm looking
around. At 59 dollars each for Vanco Winters, that is a steal of a deal. Could
I just run these year round and have a nice aggressive tread at a cheap
price?? Just wondering about longevity.
