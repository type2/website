This is not true. If you use the sump plate with the fitting for the sender
a-la Porsche 914, it reads the temperature from the exact same location as
the dipstick sender.  I've had the case apart and examined it very closely.

If you just drill the hole in the existing sump plate, the sender will
still be very close to where the dipstick sender is.  I've used both and
didn't notice it reading cooler with the drilled sump plate.

I don't know why people want to think that the dipstick sender reads
hotter.  It doesn't, at least not a significant amount.  If your oil temps
are hitting 290, I'd check the calibration of the gauge first (stick the
sender in boiling water and make sure it reads around 210) and then I'd
start looking for blockage in the cooling system.
