Hi everybody

I just got the tapes I ordered
&gt;from Melissa and Uncle Jess.
These are the tapes  from the
latest big VW Classic, and Bad
Camberg. I was able to be at
the Classic, but there was no
way I could be at the Bad
Camberg show. These tapes
cover both shows really well,
with comments from Jerry.
Their prices are reasonable,
but the best part was that I
didn't have to tote my video
camera. Jerry did the work for
me! And probably better than I
could. I tend to just start
drooling, and forget to focus
the camera. =-)

The usual disclaimers apply:
Just a very satisfied customer
of these two fine people!
