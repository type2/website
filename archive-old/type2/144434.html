Subject: Re: [T2] Mixing and matching heads.

I did it, no machining required for the 1800 heads and 2.0 P/C's.  Same 
size.  The heads are getting tough to find, though.  Some say the 
design of the 2.0 heads flow better and actually provide more power than the 
1800's even with the increase in valve size.
