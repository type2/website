first, happy fathers day to all the current, or soon to be dads!

ok, so this sort of started, I think, a few weeks ago after a camping trip 
to Tahoe. on the drive home I thought I could smell stale beer, like someone 
had spilled it someplace inside and didn't think much else of it.

since then, everyone once in a while, I get these really rancid smell coming 
from someplace in the bus....

it seems that the smell only comes back when I first reach highway speed, 
then dies after just a few minutes. there is no way anything got in the 
front air vents, no cracks and even the little screen is brand new. besides, 
I have my tire mounted on the front, so not much of it is exposed anyway. 
what I don't get is anything that smells so incredibly bad at one moment, 
could go away almost entirely after a few minutes at highway speed. im going 
to go and just start taking anything I can apart until I find it tonight, 
and hope nothing died anyplace tricky to get at.
