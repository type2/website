Subject: Re: [T2] Re: I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

No I'm right with you on the interior layout. I've got our 4 year trained to exit the vehicle if he needs to. I heard a year ago of a British family who left their two kids strapped into their seats in their idling car while they stopped at a firends house for a moment. Car caught fire and the kids died. (BBC News) REALLY scared me. 

We have a '78 so we do have the better layout that allow easy exit of the vehicle but I will prob remove the stove and propane tank and build a modified Eurovan Weekender layout for the bus, keeping the stove/sink combo for later. Sleeping/camping inside with cooking outside. Still plan to have the table of course. 

I did not realize how hard it was to exit the vehicle with the fridge in the way until I borrowed a friend's Riviera. No exit from the rear of the vehicle. 

Chris
