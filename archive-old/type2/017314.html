   I recently received a number of repair panels from RMMW. I ordered them
through Ron Salmon at the Bus Depot (doing that gets you a discount over RMMW's
catalog price, just give Bus Depot the RMMW part #'s)
   The quality was excellent and they arrived unmolested by UPS package
stompers.
Hope this helps;
