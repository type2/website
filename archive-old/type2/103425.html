Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat-Cosmoline?

George and all,

Cosmolie is or was possibly the best rust inhibtive product ever
developed.
It withstood salt spray, humidity, and any other corrosive situation
that was thrown at it--
There is still WWII surplus still available that has survived the test
of time with a cosmoline coating.

The reason the wonder coating is no longer available in it's original
form is that it was highly toxic, and OSHA, the EPA , among other's
poo--pooed it's sale and use.

Too Bad--the stuff worked great--

Later,

TK--

 
E-mail message   
 
This talk of Waxoyl makes me wonder about what our local mechanic swears
by (and sounds like Waxoyl)- anyone hear of or have used Cosmoline? 
Cosmoline was the stuff that the military used to preserve metal parts
during WWII. Anyone who has used surplus stuff from that era knows how
tenacious the stuff is, at least for stuff in long-term storage. 
As far as situations where the surfaces are exposed to dynamic things
like thrown water and dirt, I don't know how good the stuff is, but for
interior panels it should be great. 
George
