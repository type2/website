Subject: Re: charging the spare battery while in bus..

When the bus is off, the primary is isolated from any charging being
done by your inverter.  But its just a 4 amp inverter, putting out about
14 volts (unloaded) so it should not be a problem.  When my relay went,
I just hooked my two batteries in parallel; have had no problems.  I
wouldn't use one of those super 60 amp chargers!
