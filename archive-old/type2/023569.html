Hi Folks,

Following the recent dicussion on non-standardard replacement front panels
(and as its Friday) I thought folk might like to see this picture that was in
issue 39 of Transporter Talk - the magazine of the VW Type 2 Owners Club which
arrived yesterday.

So if you aren't sqeemish (and promise not to flame me for the picture) then
point your browser at

                        http://members.aol_dot_com/wallacerd/frivan.jpg

I'll leave the pic there for a couple of weeks - if those who keep pages with
pics of unusual vans want to copy it feel free.

Good luck
Bob
