&gt;and had it splash all over my face, new fuel pump, what is the problem?  

I had the same problem, sporatically, with a type 1 engine.  After cleaning
out the fuel tank, replacing the fuel tank strainer, fuel line, and
disposable plastic filter, and rebuilding the pump, it happened again.
Finally, I took the time to check the fuel pump rod--it was heavily worn--
over an eighth of an inch too short!!  That was it.  Might not be for
you, though.
