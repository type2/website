Yes, just keep your old bellhousing. That way you can also keep your
starter, flywheel, and pressure plate.

&gt; Will a transmission for a 72-74 bus fit and work ok in
&gt; our 77 westy? What problems might occur with this
&gt; change? Our Westy needs a new trans but the cost of
&gt; the later model transmissions is a little out of our
&gt; budget right now. Thank you in advance for your
&gt; answers.
