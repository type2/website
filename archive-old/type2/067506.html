&gt;miles, repairs done...? Is the Jetta a good sturdy vehicle? Asking price on
&gt;this (&quot;it's a '70-something&quot;) is $1500...

Hello Ruthie, what do you mean by &quot;it's a '70-something&quot;??
Jetta's weren't introduced until the early '80's. 

Is it a turbo diesel?
that's always a plus... the diesels seem to run forever.
I had a '81 Rabbit diesel and It had around 230k mi. when I sold it. (hd. gskts.
replaced once.)
