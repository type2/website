Subject: Dual Battery Relay Kit

Hi list,

Just got my Dual Battery Relay Kit from the Bus Depot... was wondering if
anyone has installed one of these before?  The instructions say to run the
blue/red wire to a 12/7S socket (Connect to Pin 2 for auxiliary battery
charging or Pin 6 for refrigerator)  What exactly does this mean in layman's
terms?  Where should I connect that wire?  There is alternative wiring shown
that says &quot;if preferred, for charging the aux battery in the boot via single
pole plug and socket [not included]&quot;  Would it be better to go that route?

Also, it says that the relay energizing circuit should be &quot;connected to a
12V supply which only becomes alive when either the ignition is switched on
(not accessory side) or possibly when the engine is running&quot; the wire is
about 1.5' long... where should this be connected to?

Thanks in advance for the suggestions,
D
