&gt;Does anyone know of a good way to clean up the corroded aluminum
&gt;on the louvered windows in a camper?  I have tried the usual corrosion
&gt;removal jellies with very little success.  Any ideas?  Is it going to
&gt;have to be steel wool and elbow grease?

Go to Sears and get a polishing block made for aluminum. Looks and feels like
a black school eraser. REALLY bad scratches can be hit with fine sand paper
first, steel woool will do most bad areas. Then finish with Never Dull, a
product used on motor cycles. Available at most auto parts stores. Rub till
black and buff out to a beautiful shine.
