Subject: server

could some enterprising soul - develop maybe a ball cap, or bumper
sticker, how bout a type2_dot_com nose ring (jk) - or ... something alone
that line that could be sold to list members to raise money - i guess it
would have to be something other than a T-shirt or cupholder - since
those have been done and lots of people already have those - since some
of the commercial people get great advertising value via this list im
sure they would be happy to distribute whatever was developed :) - so
long as their costs were covered

wouldn't some sort of cap with type2_dot_com be cool (or has it been done?)
- and im sure most folks would buy one - if the goal was to support the
list
