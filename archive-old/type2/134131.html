Subject: ID my dizzies - 2nd try

I am trying again - the only reply I received to my last post was Phil's
and he suggested to check oldvolkshome - which I had already done. So,
here we go again:

I have already checked oldvolkshome but need some more help ...

071 905 205 does not come up at all. It is an electronic ignition dizzy
that I pulled off a European Vanagon CU engine (2 L dual carb). I want
to make sure that it was supposed to go an said engine as they also had
electronic iginition distributors on the 1600 type 1 Vanagon engines. If
this is indeed a 2L distributor, how do I time it - 7.5 BDTC with retard
disconnected?

022 905 205P lives on my girl friend's '72 camper engine. Oldvolkshome
says 1700 Type 4 D-Jetronic. Unfortunately, there are no advance specs
listed for this one. Does anyone have them? Also it says to time it
&quot;27deg BTDC _at_ 3500rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected&quot;. What would
be the idle spec with advance connected and retard disconnected - 7.5
BDTC?

Thanks,
Marcus
