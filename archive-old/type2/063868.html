Subject: 70's era beetle stuff FS

A friend of mine should be soon taking delivery of a buncha 70's era Beetle
stuff (mostly interior items and maybe some sheet metal)

If anyone is looking for interior items and potentially some sheet metal,
please contact me. Once things get cleaned up and sorted out he should have
a better idea of what is there
