Subject: Re: [T2] Friday - VW Planet sighting

We've had our 78 Westy since August 2000... put 30,000 miles on it the first
year, loved every minute of it,
Acquired 71 Riviera in Sept. 2001, think it is going to be my favorite....
getting ready for engine change in it right now.

&gt; &gt;&gt;BTW Since its friday, what's the longest anyone on the list has owned
their
&gt; &gt;current bus(es)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have had my '77 bus for 10 years this spring....my '79 for 4 years...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Collie
&gt;
&gt; me too - coming up 10 years on my 75 westfalia. never will sell. two
&gt; children since then, and they love the orange glow when the curtains are
&gt; closed, and they love the child's cot (both weigh less than 75lbs).
sure,
&gt; people drop by and ask if they can buy it. and i say, jeez, why don't you
&gt; just take my dog?    - steve
