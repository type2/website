Volks,

The structural element I was talking to Nikki of is as follows.  VW
started making the bus body with a welded-in support panel at the B pillar
line back in the 50's and moved to eliminate it very slowly.

I believe thereare two reasons for this support, one in typical use, one
in an accident.  Both are due to the typical cross section being a square
tube.  Although this square tube is braced by the nose and tail at either
end in typical use the unbraced body has an ability to twist that would
make maintaining door alignment between the A and B pillars difficult.  
Adding a brace/bulkhead behind the front seat, even a partial one,
basically shortens the length of the tube and limits its ability to twist.  
This holds the A and B pillars in better alignment and means you can close
the door in funky parking situations, or when one wheel is up on a jack.  
Second, in a rollover accident, square section bodies have a tendency to
collapse.  Again, adding a bulkhead helps prevent this.

Now I know that the bulkhead was eliminated in later bodies, but I don't
know if there were structural mods elsewhere to give back the bracing that
was taken away.  I do know that VW was awfully fond of putting it in and
kept doing so whenever they could (walkthru was the option, not bench seat
for many years) even tho they probably had many dealer/customer
complaints. Even after eliminating the bench seat as the standard, they
kept adding the metal seat back into the 70's.  My feeling is that they
wanted to add it and that customer pressure eliminated it.

Thus my advice to anyone thinking of eliminating the bulkhead is not to. I
have a natural &quot;vintage pervert&quot; reluctance to making permanent changes,
of course, but in this case I believe you are also substantially weakening
the structure of the body...  a bad thing.
