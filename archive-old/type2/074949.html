Subject: Re: [T2] wheel cease


sometimes the ebrake will freeze or sieze in the &quot;on&quot; position. if it has 
been really cold, i think you can pour lukewarm water on the rear brakes... 
i am not sure about this though, other thoughts?

&gt;Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2002 20:13:58 -0800
&gt;
&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I have a '72 Kombi in *running* condition. I left it for two or three weeks
&gt;over winter (no extreme cold, just wetness so far as the weather went) and
&gt;now it will not move. The engine will run and sounds and works fine, but it
&gt;is as if there are imaginary blocks behind the drive wheels. I gave it some
&gt;gas in reverse and the right rear went &quot;clunk&quot; and I could feel the
&gt;resistance go away from that wheel. But, no matter what i try the left rear
&gt;is locked. Is it ceased? Could it be transmission or brake related?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;- Ian
&gt;
