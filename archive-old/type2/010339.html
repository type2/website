Thanks for the help getting the fuel pump thing fixed.

I started the new engine for the first time and ran it
at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes. Shut the engine off,
changed the oil. Trying to adjust the overhauled 34
PICT-3 and it won't idle. Adjusting it per Bentley
manual
It is a stock '71 Westy.

What could the problem be???

Thanks,
