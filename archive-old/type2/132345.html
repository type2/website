Subject: Re: [T2] Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

Go the same exact unit from RMMW for $60 ( some kind of special at the time.
Was nearly completely rusted after driving 10 miles in completely dry
weather.  Painted it with high temp POR, several times.  Was completely
rusted away after 1 year.  My mechanic tried to sell me another for $250.

Looks cool and sounds cool also, just made from compressed rust.
