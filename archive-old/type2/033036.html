Couple questions for you engine builders
On my next engine I want to balance it, does anyone have a preference as to 
which counterweighted crank to use? Most seem to run around $150 is a scat 
crank worth the extra money?
Anyone have any experience with lightened flywheels or would you have a stock 
flywheel drilled for the extra dowels.
Lastly, anyone have experience with the big valve heads, I'm referring to the 
CB 044 heads with 40mm valves, I like the idea of the extra meat in the heads
thanks all
