Subject: F/S -- 21 Window 1966 

The following ad appears in a local paper:

1966 VW Deluxe Microbus -- 21 window ragtop, asking $3000,
tel.  302 659 3071.

The location is around Smyrna, Delaware.  Call the seller (not me) for
more information.  However, if you give me some lead time, I may be
able to go and check out the µbus for you.....
