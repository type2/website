&gt; As to why it wasn't on there, who knows.
&gt; I bought the bus w/tranny, the OE engine, a spare and some other misc. parts
&gt; a while back.

same old DPO story.

&gt; My thought is that the PO dropped the engine and then thought to remove the
&gt; throttle linkage.
&gt; I found a strange bent-up shaft with a flange and bolt in one end and a
&gt; broken stud in the other when unpacking the parts.

oh yeah, I think everyone does that the first time they drop an auto
tranny bus engine....most people catch it before significant damage.

&gt; That is when I went back to find that weird bent-rod-looking thing.
&gt; I had to mill the rod end a bit and weld a cap screw to the end of it to get
&gt; it back to near OEM.
&gt; That all seems to be going well but now I am trying to replicate the factory
&gt; bends in the linkage.
&gt; After the bends the PO put in it I am not sure which ones are intentional.

I think it only has one small bend near the firewall sort of


   engine.....
                    .
                            .
                                   .tranny

hope you get the idea

&gt; As to the try another question...I tried everything that I could find from
&gt; my &quot;nuts can&quot; and nothing worked.

seem to recall it being a really thin nut with a nylok type insert..??

&gt; I will try the BD guys next I guess.

try Mitchell Motor works, (BustedBus)

&gt; It is, as you said, the linkage on the side, same spot as the shift linkage
&gt; arm.
&gt; Seems to be on some sort of concentric shaft.
&gt; It sticks up while the shifter lever hangs down.

right, and whatever you do be carefull with the ball at the accelerator
linkage end,  break that and you will be practicing your welding skills.
and the (*_at_{ &amp;%$##  socket always seems to get stuck on the blang thing,
lots of PB blaster/WD40/CRC/pick your favorite

&gt; Any other input on the auto-tranny is appreciated.

Be very careful with how you put on or remove the shift linkage cable,
follow Bentley instructions EXACTLY no matter how dumb they sound. it is
the only way to get that thing on or off...and it is easy to break and of
course NLA.

&gt; Sometimes when you ain't got all the bread you get all the fun.

been there still doing that.
