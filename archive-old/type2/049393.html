Subject: Re: [T2] engine sounds like a diesel

&gt; That does sound wierd.
&gt; 'Sounds like a diesel' would imply that it is NOT  a
&gt; high-pitched 'pinging' sound, right?
&gt; If it is, its 'predetonation' and is bad for a VW. 

&quot;sounds like a diesel&quot; implies a thunking kind of
noise that occurs when it idles or is in a low gear. i
couldn't really hear it when i accelerated, but it is
definitely there in teh lower rpms. its almost as if
something was loose and hitting the engine wall. i
would call it a &quot;thwack&quot; that's why at first i thought
it was a loose belt. 

&gt; 
&gt; Is it absolutely related to the speed of the
&gt; vehicle?  does it happen if you coast back down
&gt; through 30 mph in nuetral?
&gt; 

when you shift down the noise appears again. i find
that as soon as i hit teh speed needed to shift into
3rd gear i don't hear the noise.

&gt; Can you get it to happen by just revving the engine
&gt; with the bus in nuetral?
&gt; 
it occurs when it ideals. when you rev the engine with
it in neutral it goes away once at a certain point.
somehow teh lower rpms seem conducive to the
thwacking.

&gt; Need to know in order to focus on engine or
&gt; transaxle.
&gt; 
&gt; Please post your reply to the list...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; hi list. the 79 bus i've been looking at makes a
&gt; &gt; diesel like noise when in lower gears under 30
&gt; mph.
&gt; &gt; once above it 30 mph it goes away.  i went to one
&gt; &gt; mechanic and he said it was possibly the gears but
&gt; &gt; couldn't tell for sure without taking the engine
&gt; &gt; apart.
