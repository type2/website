It should not even be available now! Production was supposed to end on Jan. 1
1996 in the US.   The Montreal Protocol bans its use by 2000.  There is an
increasing black market for the stuff. (why? people don't care about the
ozone layer? I guess some people have no problem with skin cancer and
cataracts, not to mention less plant life.  For the narrow thinking: your
grass will burn more. .)  You can purchase conversion kits to legal
refrigerants. 2000 was the international cutoff for manufacture of r 12 .  My
advice do everyone and your children a favor and make the conversion rather
than buying the remaining r 12 or black market stuff.  It has almost the same
performance as the old stuff. Its theoretical performance is better but
practical is about %15 less efficient. Remember the ozone layer is Earths
sunscreen.

&gt;  Any guess how long we'll be able to get R12?
