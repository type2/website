&gt; most likely. sorry it's a heavy bus, what do you want? ;) At least in
&gt; it's stock form. Plus the vanagon is quite heavy also.

Maybe, maybe not.  25MPH in second on US101 does seem to be a bit slow
for a 2.0 vanagon.  Even my heavily loaded 1600 bay managed to climb the
passes in 3rd on my last blast on US 395 over much higher terrain, and I
don't use WOT.

It would seem to me that some basic checks of compression and timing
(particularly at driving RPM) are in order.  A non-advancing distributor
might be a cause of these symptoms.

&gt; BTW wanna talk about slow up hills? I recently got back from a long
&gt; trip where I took my 66 westy up and over trail ridge road which tops
&gt; out at 12,183 feet. While I ran very very slow, and ended up cresting
&gt; the hill in 1st gear my little bus made it with no problem. We were
&gt; creaping though. Loaded up with 6 people and a trailer.

Gee, and here I was feeling sorry for my bus on its last trip!  :)
