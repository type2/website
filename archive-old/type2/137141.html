Subject: What the . . ? Fattie adjusting screws!

Hi all,

Several months ago I bought a Gene Berg swivel screw (&quot;elephant foot&quot;) 
valve adjuster kit for the Wonderbus. Didn't install the kit because 
that engine blew up. I purchased a replacement 1600 DP engine in Mexico 
and put it in the Wonderbus and it has been peachy ever since. Today I 
got around to pulling the rocker assemblies off the new engine with an 
eye toward installing the swivel foots and discovered that the newer 
rocker arms take M10 adjusting screws. But the GB kit is set up for 
rockers with M8 thread.

I stared and harrumphed for a while, then disconsolately put the rocker 
assembly back onto the engine with the factory adjusting screws. They 
are already becoming faceted so I want to sort out this little issue out 
promptly.

Berg's website makes no mention of the swivel set coming with anything 
other than M8 adjusters, so I reckon I need to install rockers with M8 
threads (I have e-mailed them requesting advice). The old engine's 
rockers have a lot of fretting where the rocker bears against the rocker 
axle, so I don't want to use them.

So, sign me,

&quot;Seeking a set of good-quality factory stock-ratio rocker arms that take 
the M8 adjusting screw that are either new or in wonderful condition.&quot;
