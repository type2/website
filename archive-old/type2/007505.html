Subject: Re: Your Opinion Please: Vanagon or Late Model Bus Westy?
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	 The original poster has a Vanagon and wonders if he'd like a late 
bubble-Westy. Neither is to be a daily driver. My advice: Find a way to 
borrow a bubble-Westy, or just buy one. DON'T sell your Vanagon first. 
See which one you like. Unlike other choices in life, this one doesn't 
have to hurt anyone's feelings :) You can always plan to sell one after a 
period of time, say a year.

	In real life, satisfaction is not guaranteed. Don't pour money
into something that's worn-out, don't give away something you value on 
impulse or because of guilt. Make your descisions clear eyed and having
realisticly looked at the alternatives.

	Here's the bottom line: One bus isn't all busses. You can get
reliability in any kind of bus, all it takes is money. Someone else
can argue which kind is most efficient of your capital and time. $32K
for a new Eurovan would buy a good splittle, a good bubble AND a fair
Vanagon, and keep them running. Listen to your heart, look in your wallet, 
make a choice, and if the choice doesn't feel good, try again. You're
teetering on Try Again.

	I wouldn't trade our '70 single-cab for a similar condition Vanagon 
single cab. I like the smaller, lighter, less safe, low-powered, simple, no 
air-conditioning, noisy &amp; efficeint bubble bus. My wife hasn't yet learned
how to drive it (It makes her anxious, being both old/fragile and
yet requiring some horsing around to operate). We seldom take family trips
because not having a back seat for our child makes both of us nervious.
But I love the feel of driving it, and the Vanagon hasn't got that feel.

	Of course, if someone wanted to trade a regular Vanagon or
double cab for our single, I'd probably take them up on it. :) Then we
could drive around as a family and enjoy the thing the way I imagined
I'd enjoy the single cab when I bought it, some time before my wife
and I met. But I'd still miss that bubble-bus feel. Sigh. Thinking
about this makes me want to go get a late bubble- 76-78, with the
catalyst &amp; FI. And get air-conditioning so we could visit Grandma
in San Bernardino. Yeah, right. I think the only real solution is to 
own one of every bus you like!

	I love the feel of the early bubble-bus, but this is doubtless
in part due to my parents having owned a '68 from new until '74. My 
brother and his wife on a Vanagon and I've borrowed it- similar
but not the same. The power is WAY NICE, but the intimate feel of
the older product isn't there. I drove an aircooled Vanagon Westy
and it had the same lack of power that the family '68, my college '69
and our current '70 single cab offer ;) But it still wasn't the same.
A Vanagon is a BIGGER vehicle. Heavier, wider, a lot more solid.

	As far as air conditioning and creature comforts, the Vanagon
has it all. Its lots quieter too. And the average one is 10 years newer.
As far as the romance of the road, simple everything, fixing this or that 
with a wrench set and a couple screwdrivers and feeler gauges, the bubble bus
is IMHO superior. Neither is better, they're different.

	Understand, if I could have any bus, and only one bus, it would be a 
Turbo Diesel or VR6 Eurovan, ideally a crewcab with a split front seat, 
white, yellow or orange. I could haul my family (3 total) in safety and 
confidence, I'd probably be able to convince my wife to drive it. But I don't 
know how to get a new crew cab in the USA, and we choose not to afford a 
regular Ev.

	Good luck, sorry to take so many words. I think around this issue
every few weeks :(.

	Bill
