Almost certainly what happened is most, but not all, of the strands of
the clutch cable broke.  I had exactly this happen to me a couple of
years ago.  The break was at the front, and the noise it made
convinced me that the entire assembly had collapsed (I knew it was
rusty and all in there).

The only major irritant I'm aware of with replacing the cable (my
experience is with splits), is that the bend back near the
transmission is a real bear to get through once you've got the rubber
guide on it.  The problem being that there's this long straight piece
on the end of the cable, and it really needs to bend to be installed
in the obvious manner.  Being stubborn helps, as does being willing to
try doing the installation at angles that are awkward while laying
down there.

Oh yeah, expect to have sore fingers after loosening up the adjustment
at the tranny to get the old cable out, and tightening it again once
the new one's in.

A helper is useful, to grease the cable while you're pulling it
through.  It's a pain to have the grease on there, but it makes later
operation of the clutch easier, and helps preserve the cable.  Since
you've got someone under the front with a load of grease anyway, have
them cover everything else that looks like it moves (particular the
place that the clutch cable attaches, but don't neglect the other
cables and guides and things).
