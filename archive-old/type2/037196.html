Subject: Question for you all

The 79 I now own was purchased for a friend of mine.  I know the last 11
years of it's history.  I rebuilt the engine about 4 years ago for him.  The
question is this.  I have to pull the engine to do the clutch.  I am
thinking about pulling the heads to have them checked out.  The engine has
about 35000 miles since the rebuild.  It is running good with just a small
oil leak at the push rod tubes.  Should I pull the heads or am I being to
cautious?  Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
