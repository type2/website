Subject: Jetta Radio/ Porsche Owners?

First off, is anyone out there into some of the middle aged Porsches? 
70s or early 80s,,,I'm kind of looking at 911s and would like someone to 
kind of &quot;school&quot; me as I'm new to the Porsche world and don't want to go 
on too big of a rollercoaster ride buying one.  I'm not really picky on 
which model or anything, but would like to get an idea of value, cost, 
options, what they're known for as far as problems, models, etc.
P-mail me off list please :)

Second, I just got a factory 2001 Jetta radio/tape player from a friend 
who just bought a new Jetta and replaced the radio with a CD player. 
This radio has a little security light, and has the VIN number of the 
car and a bar code on a sticker on the actual radio itself.  I'd like to 
put this in the 62 bus if possible as it is a pretty nice radio.  I'll 
need to get the plug to hook it up and wire it, but will I have to enter 
some sort of code so that it will work without being in its original 
car?  I know this isn't the Jetta or Porsche list, but its Friday in 
some areas, and I know some of you guys and gals have other interests 
too....

On a more bus note:  I'm hoping to get my engine in the 62 early this 
week.  I have to torque the RGB bolts, hook up the shift coupler, bleed 
the brakes, and then install the engine.  I want to start driving it 
again!!  I'm also going to throw on the BD deluxe (white) steering wheel 
too and see if I like it or not in there...
