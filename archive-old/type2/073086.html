Subject: Thanks To: [was: THE WEEKLY GUIDE TO TYPE2 / VINTAGEBUS RESOURCES]


Evidently there is some latitude this year even though Thanksgiving is not
a worldwide holiday (oh hell it's Friday anyway so I'm legal either way):

&gt;THE WEEKLY GUIDE TO TYPE2 / VINTAGEBUS RESOURCES

My sincerest thanks to George Lyle for publishing this each week, and to
the mostly unsung Joel Walker who faithfully statistices the type2 list and
has since its first day.

AND: to the list admins, Steve Dolan and Thom Fitzpatrick, who put up with
a LOT (you don't know unless you've been there, it's like herding cats in a
cold rain of complaints and requests) who keep these things running.

&gt;TYPE2 LIST SITES: [same as last week and the week before I think]

In web pages, stasis is death. Not that type2_dot_com hasn't sat moldering for
months on end in the past, it has, but in this particular instance there is
good content that can't get in the gate--our ftp has been down for going on
two weeks. I think Ron Van Ness has a raft of stuff ready to go. That man
is a prodigy--six weeks ago he knew no HTML at all and now he cannot be
stopped.

We'll get it fixed soon. Happy Thanksgiving, folks!
