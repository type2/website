&gt; Does anyone know where I could find a 71 DP intake manifold? I tried the Bus

Will:
A 71 bus manifold has the following characteristics:
Dual port
Vacuum port for the brake booster
34-pict carb base
If you have a 70 bus, you likely do not need or want the brake booster
port. But you have a dual port engine, right? Just find a bug manifold
from 71-73 without auto stick.
