Subject: Air conditoned bus

I saw a 75-79 westy with a roof mounted air conditioning unit. I've seen
this bus a couple of times, but finally I was able to pull along side and
get a good look. The front luggage rack was completely removed, and an
RV/Van type AC unit was sitting right on the roof above the forward cab.
