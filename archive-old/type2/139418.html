Subject: Re: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

This is, I suppose, a difference in attitude, and nothing much will 
come from debating it. I tend to think that it's essential to have the 
bottom end (the &quot;shortblock&quot;) in the best possible shape. Everything 
else can be changed as needed -- heads, cylinders, pistons, ignition 
and fuel, cooling -- if you have a solid bottom end. Everything else 
can be a weekend job. But a solid bottom end is non-negotiable. It 
turns a repair job into a rebuild.
