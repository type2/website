Subject: Re: [T2] Tom Wilson rebuild book question
In-Reply-To: &lt;b1.6350693.27a081ab_at_gateway_dot_net&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;Hello all, I've got questions for those who have rebuilt 72-79 motors
type4.  
&gt;I've just read in Tom Wilson's How to rebuild book the following &quot;Bullet 
&gt;proof best describes the type 4 bottom end.  If you could ruin it with 
&gt;spirited driving, you could probably destroy an anvil with a rubber
mallet.&quot;  

That doesn't really jive in todays world IMHO but others will differ.  My
experience, I've never taken apart a 100k or more mile T4 case that
still measured out by the book, but they are mostly close and I've put
em back together just fine.  Out of say 10 2.0 cranks I have around I
got 3 useable without grinding.  Big ends of rods on the 2.0 do seem
to last but small ends need rebushed.  Cams and lifters I've never seen
unworn past 75k miles.  Other people report miraculously reusing T4
parts forever.  I'm skeptical.

&gt;Do those of you with experience agree with the above statement?  The next 
&gt;question is how to differentiate between top and bottom end problems without 
&gt;splitting case.

Follow wilsons instructions for hearing rod nock or bearing noise, and
don't be confused by lifter noise which is far more &quot;clattery&quot; than either.
And of course compression and/or leakdown.  Low compression is a
top end problem and means low power, it may well be the cam isn't
all that great by the time you get to the place where the top end is gone,
but it is the rings, or valves that are losing your compression.  Other
hints to needing to break into the bottom, low (under 15psi or so) oil
pressure on reasonable weight oil at idle after warming the engine up
assuming the oil is at a reasonable temp (240F or so MAX), and of
course excessive end play but that only tends to show on a real high
mile or beat T4.

&gt;Is it possible?  Here is my understanding of bottom end: 
&gt;crank and cam shaft and bearings.  Top end: pistons, cylinders, valves and 
&gt;heads.  Am I on the right page.  Enlighten me please.  Marcus

That would be it, toss rods in the bottom.

My very personal opinions, it is misguided value to put a set of heads
alone on a T4 with over 100k miles, particularly one in a Vanagon or
one you know was running hot.  Heads and pistons and cylinders is
a better thought, but much over 125k miles or so I'd be apt not to do it
then either.  The cam is the weak link in the ones I've torn down, now it
still lifts the valves, but I'm talking 0.040&quot; or so worn off the center of
the intakes where the lifters are riding, so it will never be &quot;right&quot; even
if you put a tight top end on it.  To be frank, particularly if you are
already
into the money for pistons and cylinders as well as heads, opening it
up is really only another $80 in bearings, $60 to grind a cam, $25 to
rebush the rods, $50 gasket kit, IF the rods and crank measure out OK.
I mean to be $400 into heads, another $275 into P&amp;C's and to not have
blown another $250 is foolish if you got the time, place, and skill to
pull it apart all the way, but if the crank needs doing, more $, etc. etc.
If not, maybe you should have stopped while you were ahead, or just
bought a rebuild.  Now say you got a Vanagon that eats an intake at
65k miles, you realized it fast, the cylinder doesn't show any scoring,
sure pop one new head on it, and be ready for the other to follow in
the next 50k miles, but for most people with the average 100k+ mile
engine with relatively unknown service over its life, hoping optimistically
for an unworn bottom end in the T4 isn't wise.

YMMV.
