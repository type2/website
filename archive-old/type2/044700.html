Subject: RE: [T2] Glass removal and a new jack.

&gt;Where do you guys get the new seals?  I've got a 1980
&gt;Westfalia with a rusted sliding door window.  I know
&gt;some have said South American seals are good, but I
&gt;doubt if they make any for 80 to 92 Vanagons.  I'm
&gt;assuming you expert window removers would frown on
&gt;se-sealing the old rubber with some black RTV.

I got my seals from Rocky Mountain Motorworks, Bus Depot, and Bus Boys.
All have been of acceptable quality.  Go ahead and use the black RTV if you
don't mind how it will look, but know that the rust underneath will keep
spreading until you have holes.
