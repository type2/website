&gt;  I think this is wrong. Alternators are pretty efficient and so the power
&gt; consumed will be pretty close to the power produced. The 45 extra amps
&gt; at 14V (conservative) is only 630W: less than one horsepower (746W).

first rule of Thermodynamics (freshman physics, or was that the 3rd law,
freshman year was a long time ago, in any case) is the law on the
consevration of energy.  when that law is proven wrong buy stock in
perpetual motion machinery

&gt;  VW supplied 70A alternators as an option, AFAIK they didn't alter the

for some reason I thought the stock alternator on the typeIV engine was
65A and the optional one was 90A.  I know when mine was checked out it
logged a perfect 65A output, and was told it was right on spec.  (and I
have used this guy for 30years to rebuild my Gen, Alt, Starters, he didn't
even take my money for the test)

&gt; wiring with this modification. Work out how much power draw you've added
&gt; to the electrics and add at least that much power output to the generator

don't forget the charging circuit

&gt; and you'll be on the right track. Be sure you don't put too much current
&gt; through wiring not designed for it (ie uprate the battery feed and take
&gt; your extra accessory feeds from that bus, not the original fuse panel).

yes, I believe the main bus on a bus (don't you love English?) is 8 guage

&gt;  Remember that fuses protect cables, not equipment. They are there to 

no a fuse only limits the amount of current beyond that point, usually it
will protect equipment but fuses are too slow for most electronics so
protection is limited.

fires in buses are bad, sometimes around a cheery campfire with friends
fire can be Very good indeed
