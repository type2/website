Subject: RE: Friday Bus fantasy

 I'm just modifying this fantasy to fit mine- easier and I'm lazy today...

Based on my current vehicle- a '78 Bus.

1.  No rust (biggest fantasy of all)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.  Stainless steel exhaust muffler and heat exchangers
3.  Comfortable driving/passenger seats.
4.  Good heater!!!!!!!!
5. Long range gasl tanks to give 1000 mile range.
6. Heated and alarmed garage to keep it in, with pit and work-bench.
7. New headliner.  Re-painted and finished to my goal of watery, sky-y,
spacey scape.
8. Finished dashboard paint scheme.
9. Repair paint damage, dings and scratches and repaint inside to better
standards.
10. New front brakes.
11.  The money to do this!!!!
