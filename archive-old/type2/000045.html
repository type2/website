I may open my self for a bombardment of conflict, but here I go.  We have 
used a propane heater in our Westy for years and were recommended by many RV 
establishments that the westys design was one of which to permit such an 
event.  Now vent windows need to be used and this is to include front window 
vents.  Just mount the heater (mobil or permanent) in a larger air space 
allowing air current, and pop out the vent windows and wallah heat. not all 
the way open but enough.  I was also encouraged to use a fan to blow on the 
heating element all gases away from the sleeping quarters, here is where the 
front vents come into play.  I was even told that was why the front vent 
windows rotate in both directions as easily as they do, to allow air current 
to better circulate out, yet to be scientifically documented(laughing).  But 
done right is an absolute benefit to the occupant.  I'll continue to use 
propane as a source of cooking and heat inside for as long as needed 
regardless of others notions not to.  Also easy to hide fuel canisters.
Peace Out
