Hi Volks, 

  It's been a long time since I've posted, but my bus is still running
great and now I'm getting around to having some much needed body work done.

  I am looking for someone who has an otherwise trashed bus that would be
willing to cut out a section of lower sliding door track and floor pan
about a foot to each side of the track, and a foot or so inwards.  I am
planning on then doing the same on my bus, and having the new piece welded
in, so I'm looking for something in nice shape, and not all rusted through,
since that is how mine is at present. :-)

  I'm not sure what it would be worth, but I am willing to talk about
price.  If anyone has any leads on this, I'd appreciate any info you provide.  

  I realize that individual sections can be bought from RMMW and other
places, but on advice of someone who knows, I am attempting to go this
route instead, and simply install the whole chunk at once.  

  Thanks in advance for any help or advice.  Keep on putt, putt, putting
along Volks!

-- Eric
