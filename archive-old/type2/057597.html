Try this- I've done this trick to get things out of VCR's or computers.
Get a piece of plastic tubing that will fit thru the plug hole.
Tape this inside of your vacuum cleaner hose so no air escapes past the
tape.    Slowly move the crank so the piston is fairly high to bring the
screw closer to the plug hole. With the vacuum going, carefully fish the
hose into ther hole, feel around until you &quot;hear&quot; the tube being blocked,
and slowly draw it out the the hole.
   You can look down the hole if you solder small wire leads to a
flashlight bulb  and feed it down to the bottom of the hole so you can see
inside- e

asier when it's dark out and your irises are fully open.  Sears makes a
small probe light (auto area of hardware section) that's a tiny bulb on a
stalk- I use it to see inside the bores of wooden instruments like an oboe.
 You can also stick this down there to look.  Remember to use the natural
bend of the vacuum hose to aim down to the bottom of the cylinder.
