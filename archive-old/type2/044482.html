Bob is absolutely right!  To let you know how bad this deal is... I would
be happy to:

Fly to Seattle from Virginia                           $ 400
buy a *new* 1600 DP mexican engine (fully decked out)  $1500
and install it and make                                $ 600 on the deal!

For that $600, I would even be willing to buy and pop-rivet in enough
gutter-flashing to make it last 10.000 miles before it toasted itself!
(actually, I would feel that I was stealing from you if I didn't seal up
the engine compartment)

I used pessimistic estimates all around.  I *think* a Mexiblock is less
than $1500... If he is offering a used 1600 engine then he is a true
rip-off artist!  plus I have been flying to the west coast a bit lately
and know the air fares.  I cannot recommend strongly enough that you
give this guy a pass on his offer!

If you are considering this seriously, mine is a serious offer... I have
friends out there, and would love to visit and make $600 in the deal!
