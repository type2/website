Subject: Westy water tank cap
Message-ID: &lt;19990627203806.9894.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I need your help.  The cap for the water tank in our 71 Westy broke, and I'm 
in need of another cap.  If anyone has a spare they are willing to part 
with, or knows where I can get one, please let me know.
