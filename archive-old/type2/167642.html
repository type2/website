&gt; All righty then; I do indeed know how it goes as I am currently

&gt; yesterday. (Grumble grumble).


ouch, ,ouch,  what a bummer....have you got a replacement for the
replacement???

on my bus note, Safelite showed up today at 11:30 to put a new windshield
in my bus.  3 techs and 5 hrs later it was finally in,  seems the new
rubber from Bus Depot (Don't remember where they got it) was just a hair
too thick and they could not get it to go, so put back in with my 30 year
old rubber.   any one know what would work to replace that &quot;Chrome&quot;
colored plastic that goes in the slot in the rubber??

asked for one with a tint at the top, was told they didn't have one, told
them that was OK, so they show up with one with a tint, oh well. have nice
tinted windshield now.  maybe  just maybe I'll drive this thing yet.  boy
was going to Everybus &quot;expensive&quot;

hope you get yours' back together before busses of the corn.  not sure I
have any parts to help you out.....what went up in your engine
