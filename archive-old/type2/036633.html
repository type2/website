Subject: Re: VDO U-Brackets....

&gt; The other thing I was wondering is if anyone out there has any spare U
&gt; brackets for VDO gauges? I recently mounted 3 in the dash between the radio
&gt; cutout and the ashtray. Looks great but I can't find the hold down brackets.

I'm not sure why you would need the hold-down brackets. If you drilled 2&quot;
holes into the padded dash, the gauges will stay in place through friction
with the padding. Besides, the padding is so thick, there will be no room
for the brackets in the back. If a gauge is somewhat loose, increase the
effective diameter of the housing by simply wrapping a couple layers of tape
around it.
