&gt;Recently I replaced the alternator and voltage regulator on my '72 after
&gt;the red light came on.

The blue wire shorted to ground, turning on the light.

&gt;It was definitely not charging as the battery ran
&gt;down several times before repairs were made.
&gt;
&gt;After installing the new alternator and regulator, the red light still
&gt;stayed on and the system was not charging.  Under the dash we found the
&gt;blue wire from the regulator to the alternator indicator light and the
&gt;brake system warning light had been incenerated.  After these were
&gt;restored, all was okay.
&gt;
&gt;Here are my questions for the Electrical Wizards:  Was there nothing wrong
&gt;with the old alternator and/or regulator?

More than likely: no


&gt;Can somebody explain to me why
&gt;the system would not charge simply because the indicator light and brake
&gt;warning light were not connected?

This is your 'ignition on' signal to the alternator. This circuit has to 
have 12v to trigger the field circuit. No field: no charge. This is the same 
system in Mercedes Benz.


&gt;Does this blue wire connected to the
&gt;indicator light/brake warining light have to be charged 12V in order for
&gt;the alternator to put out a charge?

Yes. 12v goes from ignition on [circuit 15] to the bulb.  Since the 
alternator isn't turning and putting out a magnetic field, the wire is a 
ground. So the light goes on. When the alt. starts working: ground goes 
away, light goes out. Kind of a poor design. The circuit goes thru the 
brushes. If the brushes are worn out, the light won't come on when you turn 
the key on because you lost the ground circuit. Sounds like a good idea 
until you wear out the brushes while you are driving, then the alternator 
stops charging but the light doesn't come on because you have no ground. 
About the only time the light will come on to indicate a failure is if the 
belt breaks.

&gt;Could I have temporarily gotten the
&gt;system charging again by hot wiring the blue wire from the regulator to the
&gt;battery?

A little risky. By going thru a bulb, the bulb acts as a resister.
