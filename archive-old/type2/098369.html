&gt; I've still got some questions about the coil... everyone is saying that if I

&gt; setup (Crane)? Is the blue coil still the correct coil? Thanks for any info,

Mike,

I don't know.  I know VW pretty well.  I don't know Crane at all.  I had
an electronic ignition for a short time but I ditched it when it stranded
me.  I like setting dwell and am not comfortable if I can't.  Every time I
do something that is not bone stock, it gets me in trouble so I stopped
doing that.  Sorry.
