Subject: Forwarded Message: Fuel Pump Cover Seal

With all this thread going on relative to FIRE, I am wondering if my
question, as follows, actually made it to the post for the list to read, so
I ask again.............

For reference:
Bus: 1970 Westy
Item: Original fuel Pump
Detail of Item: Bentley Book Section 3 on Fuel System, Page 9, Drawing
Figure 4-3, Item 4 - &quot;Cover Seal&quot;
also, A picture of my bus engine _at_
http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/newbus2/Engine%20Left%20View.JPG
showing the fuel pump and  the bolt on top that you loosen to gain filter
access.

Does anybody out there know a source for this cover seal gasket ??

Thanks,
Bob Perring
