&gt;Tim, this, true or not, does not relate to the issue. VW's attitude to a

So by all means, act as if what seems to be true is true whether it is or
not and before you KNOW.

How would Nike feel if you marketed aftermarket shoe laces with the Nike
logo?? Would they be justified in having your production destroyed by court
order?? And receive a fine for your theft, if theft of value is indeed at
issue?? To assume they act of ill intent at this point is just not
reasonable. They are following market realities much, much bigger than the
Type I, II and III markets put together.
