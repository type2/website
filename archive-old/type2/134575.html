Subject: Saggy bottom

Hmmm... check the archive. Didn't we just recently discuss this issue? Your 
bus sags about like mine, which is a little more than most I've seen. The 
previous thread suggested the front is supposed to be sprung up in the air a 
little so that it balances level with a 240 pound occupant in the driver 
seat.

Here's a photo from 1983 of my 1978 bus.

Does anyone think the rear end is sagging? The bus was so new it can't be so 
I wonder how many folks do the spring plate adjustment only to find it's in 
spec.
