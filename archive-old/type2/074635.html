Subject: Re: [VB] Virus question

Virus questions were, at one time, taboo on the List... I thought they
still were.
Ken, Sean, David et al have set things up so that THE LISTS can NOT give
you a virus.
Listmembers are supposedly good with busses. NOT computers. While many can
offer help, it should be done off-list; more to the point, if you have a
computer, it should be YOUR obligation to maintain it, know what goes wrong
with it, and prevent it from harming others... like with your bus.  Its not
hard, there are dozens of sites on the web to help you - I have a Mac, and
use Macfixit for a start. You PC users... well, if you don't want to learn
Linux, at least learn how to set the preferences on your Microsh*t programs
so that they don't automatically do bad things to you.

Not meaning to be snippy, but the recent post Ken made about $5/day to pay
for list hosting? We can help KEEP it that low by not wasting bandwidth,
and keep the admins happy by not making them run around trying to stop a
thread or do detective work for stuff that is not their problem.


Having said THAT... all 5 Lists I am on have been asking about viruses and
weird attachments today. The Net has been glacial. Somethin is obviously
afoot, so please go to a relevent webpage and try and see how to fix your
computer before you do anything else today.
