Subject: anyone buy cores?

Does anyone know of people who buy cores.  I recently
bought an engine but didn't need a core.  I am now
sitting on 2 air cooled vanagon cores that are in
pretty good shape and want to clean out the garage.  I
am in the maryland, DC area but forward air ships for
less than $60

Keep it positive
