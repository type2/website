&gt;  There's a slim possibility that the coil (or even the condensor) is
&gt; failing at high rpms when the current flow is higher.

Current flow does not increase with RPM.  The points are still closed for
the same percentage of the time, so the current stays the same.

However, the power available to each firing of a spark plug decreases with
increasing RPM, since the number of firings per unit time increases, so a
weak ignition component is likely to show up first at higher RPMs.
