Hi, Orange vw:
piece o' cake here:
yank that ole' harness from the front.
tape up the new one so it won't snag or rip
because it's a good tug, you will get the feel
for it when the old one comes out.

splice in a good stiff piece of hardwire wire-
the only hard part is getting it through
the frame channel and up over the axle.
grease it up a little. have a helper put a
little tension on it as it goes in to help keep
it straight, and with a little give and take, you're there...
and it helps to have gloves on and take a few wraps...
