Subject: Re: [T2] bleeder valves

Here's what worked for me:  heat and parafin.  My front bleeders came off
with Liquid Wrench and tapping, but the rears were stuck as if welded.  Try
heating the area right around the tap where the valve is screwed in, real
close to it.  Then when it's medium hot, not glowing mind you - just really
warm, touch a block of parafin (an ordinary candle might do the same) to the
base of the bleeder valve and the parafin will be sucked in, just like when
you solder a plumbing joint.   Tap it lots with a hammer and it might just
back right out.  You shouldn't need a whole lot of strength on the wrench if
it's ready to come out.

Good luck.
