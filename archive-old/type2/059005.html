Subject: Getting hot while sitting still

	Howdy. I bought a '74 hardtop a few months ago, with the stock 
1800 pancake/dual carbs, and have noticed a discrepancy with the old 
dipstick grab-with-yer-fingers oil temp test. I've noticed that while 
pulling into a gas station and scurrying round the back in a hurry, 
things seem docile. However, after pumping gas and buying a drink, the 
stick's temperature seems to go up markedly. Is this because the hot oil 
needs to drain into the sump first, or because no more airflow is 
cooling the block?

	Yeah, yeah, I know: install a sensor. It came in the mail last 
week, I'll slap it in when I get a chance. Probably with a bunch of 
stupid questions, too.
