My tune-up plans were thwarted this weekend by the sudden realization that
there are no discernible timing marks on the crank/fan pulley of the bus:'72
type IV engine 009 diz. The timing scale is intact and there is a nice
centerline on the fan housing but nothing visible on the pulley that looks
remotely like the  two timing marks that are alluded to in the &quot;idiot book.&quot;
I removed the plastic cap on top of the fan housing as suggested by Muir but
this only revealed a dark and dirty place where the other side of the fan
lives. Am I missing something obvious?

I was convinced for the longest time that none existed on my 81 as well. I was
timing off a scratch mark from a PO. Then I happened to spot it on the pulley
while working with a flashlight and looking at the section toward the
alternator, ie between the belts. It is a &quot;&gt;&quot; and as I recall the placement
was such that it was near impossible to see on the belted side. I then re-
etched and painted white a mark that I could readily see with the timing
light. Maybe it was in that dark and dirty place?
