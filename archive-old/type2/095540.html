Subject:  Re:  HELP ME !!!

A more involved solution would would be to weld the hole in the case.  You
can do this yourself, but you will need to drop the engine and completely
tear it down.  There is a product called Durafix (and other similar
products), that I have used for numerous aluminum repairs (although not on a
VW engine case), but I see no reason why it would not work on an engine
case.  A propane torch is all the heat that's needed.  I have no doubt that
such a repair would be permanent.  Perhaps your machanic will be willing to
help you out knowing that this solution is available.
