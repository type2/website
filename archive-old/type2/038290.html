Subject: Re: Accelerator cable for 75 Weekender

&gt; After the last engine removal/reinstallation my accelerator cable seemed
to
&gt; shrink in length, so I figured it must be snagged somewhere along the way.
&gt; While trying to remove it today it has become really stuck good.  I have
&gt; about 3 feet of it our of the front of the bus, and it won't come out any
&gt; further, nor will it go back in.  What to do now?

3 feet is about where the end of the flex tube is. Slide uder the bus and
reach up and over the transaxle. You should find a flexible tube for the
cable. One end fits in a hole in the support at the front upper engine tin
and the other end fits into the end of the welded-in tube. Remove the rear
end and try to pull the flex tube off the cable. Now get someone to pull the
cable out the front while you make sure it goes thru the tube.
