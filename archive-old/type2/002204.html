+AD4-I belive the flaps were to allow any extra air to flow into the heat
+AD4-exchangers.  I am not sure what condition would cause the need for these
+AD4-but VW saw a need.

My understanding is that when the electric blower is on and the engine is
idling or off, then the air flow  tends to take the easiest route out and
escapes upstream through the motor driven fan. The flaps stop this happening
and the only way out is to the cab.
