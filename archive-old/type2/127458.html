Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

&gt; i'd like to know why the list is suggesting that a pressure of 65 psi is
&gt; way to high and anyone that inflates tires to that pressure should be
&gt; avoided?  i'm running a vanagon with michelin 195/75/14 tires.  i run
&gt; them at 60-65 psi and i have logged 10,000 or more miles on them.  i
&gt; haven't experienced any negative effects that i know of.  my personal
&gt; feeling is that its for the most part its personal ride preference, am i
&gt; wrong?  i like my van to drive like a truck not ride like a car so i keep
&gt; the pressures up at max inflation.

Just because you have done it doesnt make it smart, safe or sensible.
It has nothing to do with personal ride preferance it has to do with
safety and engineering.
Its your bus and you can do whatever you like, of course.
