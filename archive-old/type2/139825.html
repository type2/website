&gt; Is metal fuel line and metal brake line the same thing? Can brake line

&gt; Fuel lines are seam welded.
&gt; Brake lines should be roll formed.
&gt; With all the imports I can't be sure in today's market.

I would not worry about using brake line for fuel.

would never use fuel line for brakes.

YMMV.
