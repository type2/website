&gt; Powder coating melts at 425-450 degrees F. so if your rims are getting that

&gt; lugnut and let us know? I would REALLY doubt my lugnuts are getting anywhere
&gt; near that temp.

They don't have to get up to that temp to become &quot;plastic&quot;, just to become
liquid.  Best to mask the holes and mounting surfaces.
