Subject: Re: [T2] Valve not wanting to adjust !!

&gt; Went to adjust #2 cyl. valve the valve closest to back
&gt; of bus,(dont know if this is intake or exaust).
&gt; the pistons toped out, and the adjusting screw is
&gt; backed out, but my gauge will not go between rocker
&gt; and valve stem.
&gt; 
&gt; i pushed this in by hand to experiment, and im able to
&gt; push this in with effort, but the other 3 valves next
&gt; to it are very hard..
&gt; 
&gt; what gives?
&gt; keep in mind i just got this bus running (rather
&gt; roughly) after it sat w/ PO for last 7-8 yrs.
&gt; 
&gt; do i have to replace valve? can i live w/ this? I just
&gt; put new exaust, torqued everything, dont tell me I
&gt; have to remove the head...

you need to remove the head........sorry BTDT
