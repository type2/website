Subject: Re: Shifter bushing

My engine is in.

My big problem is with the front bushing.  I'm not coping with the rear
bushing(s) - I think there are three - just the rear shift coupler, which I
got off OK with the engine in so I don't see why I couldn't put a new one in
with the engine in as well.

Of course, if I can't, that will be just my luck...

&gt; I understand that the engine must be removed for the rear bushing to
&gt; be replaced. A shifter rehab on my list also.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt;I've got a '73 Bus with a trashed front shifter bushing.  I've read the
&gt;archives on this subject but they don't address my problem - I've got the
&gt;shifter out, rear coupler off (including that weird square bolt, which was a
bee-yatch!) and what was left of the front plastic bushing off.  The bushing
the parts store gave me is clear plastic, split so you can get it around the
rod.  My problem is, the front shift rod will NOT clear the opening the
bushing goes in!  The shifter cup doesn't clear the space, so I can't pull
the rod back.  I am going crazy trying to get the bushing in around the rod,
and have concluded it's impossible.  I've tried hammering the metal that's
trapping the shifter cup, to bend it, but that hasn't done anything either.
Any ideas?

Thanks!
