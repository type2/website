Subject: bap engine running, timing question.

--part1_ff.1973688d.2a3f9b9a_boundary

Well we got our engine running, we spun the dist, around 180 and she fired 
right up. question is the dist. we have does not have vacuum advance and we 
were wondering what it is. The numbers on the side end in 009 is this what 
they call a bosch 009. If it is what should we set the timing at.
