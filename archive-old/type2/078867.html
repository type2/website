&gt;Hello All!
&gt;My '78 is finally running after three weeks idle because I was sure my=
 dizzy=20
&gt;had bitten the dust. After charging the battery, I started it one morning=
=20
&gt;only after my wife's Pontiac had a broken brake line making it unsuitable=
 to=20
&gt;drive for me.

Hope that doesn't mean it's suitable for someone else to drive, like your
wife???

 I timed the engine this time with a timing light and not by my=20
&gt;40% deaf ears, it ran fine until a few days later, when she said NO MORE=
 and=20
&gt;I noticed that the timing was about 2 degrees too far advanced (about 9.5=

&gt;BTDC), a defect that I corrected. Now the timing is correct, but she still=

&gt;lacks the power that she had a few months ago when last she ran. I also=20
&gt;experience backfiring upon decelleration, espcially when the engine is=20
&gt;really warmed up(like after about 45 minuet driving time). Anyone have any=
=20
&gt;ideas? would appreciate the help.

I would first rule out vacuum leaks. (See archives, &quot;Deutsches Methode,
Vakuum Schlucks&quot;). Then verify mixture adjustment. The backfire on
deceleration says your lean.

Also, verify that timing. Should't it be 7=B0 AFTER TDC??? If you have stock
distributor with vacuum lines for both retard and advance, it should be. If
your using just vacuum advance then the 7=B0 BTDC should be good. Verify per
Bentley. Also, verify that vacuum can isn't leaking. Just schluck through
the hose to check it out. If your using a non-stock mechanical advance only
type distributor, sell it to a T-I owner and get the proper distributor for
your motor. And note if it's a Calif. only set up, that's a different
distributor than the US 49 state set up, and may be electronic and
mechanical advance only. Verify per Bentley what's supposed to be in there.
Then verify what's actually in there. If the distributor that's in there is
wrong for the motor and you want to try to use it, use the settings for the
distributor, not the motor. If however you wish to avoid all confusion, get
the correct distributor for your motor. Bosch has made hundreds of 4 cyl
distributors that will fit in there. Every single one of them is different
in some way. Some times a swap makes little difference. Sometimes it makes
all the difference.

If you just can't bear the cost of a new stock dizzy, keep your eyes open
for one of the old cast iron 4 cyl dizzies from the 60's as used in a great
many of the Euro marks. The put on your engineers hat or hire an engineer
to modify the #3 lobe to 3=B0 retard if it came from other than a Porsche an=
d
adjust the weights and springs to match the advance curve for your motor.
Most of those old cast iron units I have run across have little if any
shaft/bushing wear and even if they do, the bushings can be replaced. I am
currently running a Mercedes original I modified for my Porsche 912. It
works so well, the subsequent genuine 912 dizzy I later found is still
sitting on the shelf.=20

I know that's more than you wanted to know, but you may certainly ignore
anything you consider unsavory or otherwise indigestable.
