Subject: RE: [T2] Custom Wheels

&gt;I was doing some research a while back on this didn't get to far , but some
&gt;Audi wheels will fit also the new passat wheels are the same 5X112 I don't
&gt;know what mods you will have to do to them but I thought they would be neat
&gt;as they are still VW rims. and the vanagon alloys will fit out of the box.
&gt;good luck and let us know what you find out.

Vanagon and Mercedes. Better start searching the archives. FWIW any of the 
wheels that come off of a FWD car such as the Passat and Audi is suspect 
due to load capacity and offset (too far in).
