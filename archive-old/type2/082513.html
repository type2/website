Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

Thanks for the help guys.
David, I'm already using a similar method to the one
you suggested &amp; have found it useful.
It is a definite pain in the rear end though......I
was proud of the fact that I could chart the fuel
economy of the Millie(our Microbus) through the
mileage she did on each tank &amp; now, because of this,
she's making my wife paranoid again.
Unfortunately, Millie did an engine in June last year
and after a 7 week wait and susequent replacement of
the fuel pump &amp; starter motor, my wife over-reacts
JUST a little when a thing like the fuel guage plays
up.
It also doesn't help that Daisy, the camper we used to
own, did a major fuse which wiped out the fuel guage &amp;
indicators while we were on holidays.
My wife loves our buses but they scare her when they
don't run perfectly.....not a good approach when you
own cars that are approaching 30 years old :-)
Anyhow, thanks once again for the advice.
I'll keep you posted about the outcome.
:-)

&gt; Andrew,
&gt; I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the
&gt; same model fuel guage:
&gt; reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it
&gt; reads empty. I am waiting
&gt; to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway.
&gt; In the mean time, I have
&gt; a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the
&gt; mileage for the next
&gt; fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150
&gt; miles (250km?) even though
&gt; I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas.
&gt; Just yesterday I filled up
&gt; after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book
&gt; says that the tank holds
&gt; 14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I
&gt; guess I cut that one a
&gt; little close.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range
&gt; between fill-ups and
&gt; fix the sender when you have the engine out for
&gt; other work.
