&gt; I'm heading down to Baja for several months and will be off-road a lot,
&gt; and I'm looking for rear ground clearance advice and alternatives. My
&gt; ASI conversion has a couple inches of rear end sag, and to make matters
&gt; worse the shop that did the last rebuild (done by PO) added a Berg-type
&gt; 1.5 qt sump, which also cost a couple inches of ground clearance and
&gt; seems pretty exposed down there, although the extra oil does seem to
&gt; help with engine cooling.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is that I need to gain a minimum of three inches of
&gt; clearance back there. I'm wondering how much can be gained by tortion
&gt; bar adjustment, and how that adjustment relates to spring
&gt; compression/travel. Any advice/knowledge would be appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, I just read an old post from a guy who had already
&gt; installed coil-over shocks, then changed to Napa coil-over air
&gt; adjustable shocks (Napa part MA758, which is still available).  He
&gt; mentioned some required spacers, but did not elaborate. Anyone have
&gt; experience with these shocks and the spacer situation?
&gt; Thanks,
