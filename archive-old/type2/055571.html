Does anyone have information on this event?  I would like to attend this
weekend, but need to know who to call to make reservations.  It would also be
nice to have an event schedule.

It's too late to send the reservation by mail, so any help would be
appreciated.

If I make it there, I will have Reimo catalogs for sale, and some Carer P4
brochures.  I also hope to setup one of my new German Bus tents.

Happy Camping

&lt;&lt;To Joe and others:

&gt;Does anyone have details on Circle yer wagens. I have my calendar marked
&gt;for May 2&amp;3 for this event, but I haven't seen anything lately on it (of
&gt;course I can't find my most recent OBR). I'd really like to confirm the
&gt;dates, get details on how to get there, and contact someone to make sure
&gt;I can get a spot in the swap area. I've never run a swap spot before, so
&gt;this will be a first for me.

If you had only sent this message yesterday before I mailed my reservation
form I could give you more details. Vendor cost is $25 per day for Sat or Sun
or $50 for both. This is a really good show whether you are buying or selling.
I've been there the last 2 years to both the Spring &amp; Fall event. Vendors come
from as far away as Florida!! 

You could mail a hand-written reservation form including your name, address
and phone number to:

AVWA 
1268 Sugar Loaf Rd.
Sevierville, TN.  37876

Admission for adults is $5 per day or $8 for weekend. Children 12 and under
free.
Campers: $5 per person for up to 4 days + $8 event pass=$13 per person.

Motel Reservations for the non-campers is at 1-800-548-9038.

Several key fun elements of the event include:

    Bug bucks--script given away during the show for participating in events
that can
                      be spent with the vendors.
    A Duck Race--proceeds goes to charity and a fun prize for the winner. You
buy a
                      numbered duck and they are released in the river that
flows by the
                      fairgrounds.
    Engine Teardown Contest, Burnout Contest, Sat evening parade, Miss CYW
Contest (usually 10 and under girls which is really cute). This is a great
family event with the kids bringing their bikes--there is a big oval paved
area they can ride on. Mom can go shopping at the outlets in Pigeon Forge, and
everyone will be happy!!

There is 24-hour security. Rest room facilities with hot showers (if you get
up early enough!) The site is very easy to find. As you drive in from I-40 to
Sevierville you cross a bridge and come to the main red light intersection at
Sevierville. (Straight ahead is P. Forge and Gatlinburg). Turn right toward
Knoxville--go across a bridge and turn right again. Watch for the signs. A
short drive out a winding road and the fairgrounds are on the right. Bring
warm clothes and extra sleeping bag cause the night-time temperature is
unpredictable.

This is a great show for bus guys!
