Subject: Re: Re:Need help with possible engine purchase

I had wondered about this issue of the different advance specs for the same 
Type IV engine in different applications. I had always heard to time a Type 
IV between 38 to 40 and was thrown for a loop when I was timing the other 
porsche engine and found the manual said only 27 degrees. What is the reason 
all these different applications are using different advances?

So does the porsche cam just raise the power band to a higher RPM, or does 
it reduce torque too?

Thanks,

John

Here is one thing that you might consider. The Vanagon Air Cooled
distributor gives the engine 42 degrees of advance at 3000 rpms.
The Porsche gives the Type IV engine 27 degrees at 3500 rpms.
The 009 distributor gives an engine 32 degrees at anything over 2500 rpms.
The 050 Porsche gives the engine about 37 degrees at 4000 rpms.
The Porsche is just a VW with a different cam and slightly higher
compression. The FI systems are either L Jet or D Jet but are different in
many ways. Particularly in the injector / AFM / Control head but a VW
counterpart might work with a substitute torque cam vs the Porsche cam.
Even running my Type IV Porsche at only 2300 pounds I've added a nice big
oil cooler and ceramic coated the exhaust to bring the engine temps down.
