When I had my old computer at my last job I was able to find the 
origional VW font on the internet,  the font is the one with the 
single line underneath it.

I have searched and searched.  and cannot find it,   I have canceld 
my list membership till I get moved,  so could you post a email 
online and ask everyone if they have seen the website where you can 
download the VW font.

Thanks,
Buddah
