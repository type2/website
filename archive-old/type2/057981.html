Subject: engine front oil seal

Hey folks,
            I'm rebuilding the engine in my 78 bus , have removed the
flywheel, and am at the point where all the manuals say to use a couple
screwdrivers to remove the front oil seal. They don't say precisely how
to use them to remove it and I don't want to hurt the case using too
much force. Any ideas on getting that seal out of there?
