Subject: 1st it got hot then oil pressure started going down!

I now have 8 miles on my newly rebuilt 2000 liter engine. It is in a 75
bus using all the 75 fuel injection parts. The distributor is from the
78 part# 021-905-205P. Timing set at 7.5 btdc. Straight 30 wt Valvoline
oil. Took it out for the first real ride this morning to fill the tank,
about 3 miles round trip. Seemed fine both directions. Oil pressure
around 30 psi. oil temp never got above 170. Checked the flaps and they
never opened on this run. About 1 hour later I went to the store 2.5
miles away. Ran great. same oil pressure, temps got to almost 180.
Stayed in the store maybe 15 minutes. About half way home didn't seem to
have much power when I hit second gear. Pressure was down to about
20-22. Temp was slightly above 180. Continued home, The last block is up
hill maybe 3 degrees. Hardly any power in second gear had to go to first
to make the hill. As I crested the hill I think I noticed the oil light
flash on for just a second. OH SH**. Oil press just below 10 when I
looked at the gauge. Temp a little above 180.

It's cooling in the drive now. Any ideas? Rechecked Old Volks Home for
distributor specs. They say 7.5 deg is right. Vacuum leak maybe? All
help is most appreciated.
Tom
