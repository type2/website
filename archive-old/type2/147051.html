Subject: Re: [T2] Looks like JBB in a Jeep?

You could have the case checked out and see if it's still good.  Who 
knows, it might be a bad bearing and you might just need to end up 
getting the crank ground and put on an oversized bearing.  Ultimately, 
if you've got the time, do the diagnosis to find out what went out.

What happened when it siezed?  Was it hot?  Or maybe it was an oil 
circulation problem... any ideas?
