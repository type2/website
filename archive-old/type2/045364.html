Subject: [T2] Oil Leak

Volks,
   I have a '79 2.0L FI motor and of course in a bus, I have this oil leak
thats been a pain in the butt, The leak is on #3 and #4 side of the motor, I
replaced the push rod tube gaskets, oil drain plug gasket. The seems or
looks like its leaking from #4 intake (I think) push rod tube. The oil is
also on the cooling tin and around the cylinders. I guess I need to know how
can I tell if its the cylinder seal or gasket. That is my only guess it
could be. Any ideas or comments will be highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance
