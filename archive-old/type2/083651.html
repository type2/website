&gt; Steve and the list, I have the same symptoms
&gt; regarding the clutch adjusting nut.  Clutch nut
&gt; is all the way in.  Even had to put some washers
&gt; on it when I replaced it with a brand new clutch
&gt; cable.  I didn't measure the cable, but the part
&gt; number was right.  I also replaced the bowden
&gt; tube, but it the TBD repacement was a soft
&gt; rubber.  No idea how to shape the thing like
&gt; bentley describes with the replacement tube being
&gt; as flexible as it is.
&gt;
&gt; Does this mean a new clutch, as Benthin suggests
&gt; and as the PO told me, or an almost worn out
&gt; clutch?

Ray,

As someone else said, if you have to keep screwing the nut on, then the
cable is too long.  Wearing clutch means letting the nut out, not in.  I
have *never* had to loosen the nut.  the cables stretch (and break) way
faster than the clutch wears.  Generally the sign that you need a new
clutch is that it begins to slip.  hear the engine race!  watch the speedo
crawl toward 55!!!  Replace the clutch disc!!!!!  For a cable that is
too long, tho, replace the cable.
