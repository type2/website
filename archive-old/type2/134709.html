Subject: CHT Temps

I have noticed that my temps seem to be rising as the temp outside gets colder
Today for example it is around 35 F and my cht is reading a higher temp then
it did when it was 80f ( 325-350 rather then 300-325)

Is this normal for these VDO gauges - are they affected by outside changes in
temp ? Wondering before I start looking around the engine compartment -

Eric
