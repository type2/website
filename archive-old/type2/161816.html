&gt; A question for the august technical wizards on the list:
&gt; In NJ they test emissions only at idle, and being over 3.0 CO,
&gt; I opend up the AFM mix screw and got 1.6 CO.  However, I thought this
&gt; adjustment ONLY affects idle, so I left it alone.  I mention this
&gt; because Don (durocshark_at_gmail_dot_com) said on his page after doing the same
&gt; thing, he turned the AFM back.  Now of interest is that in his smogging
&gt; they test at running rpms, and his went even lower, from 1.1 to 0.34.
&gt; So is the AFM adj additive to running rpms (leaning it out possibly too
&gt; much) or does it only affect idle

It only affects idle. Off idle, the velocity and volume of air that passes
the small idle orifice is of little consequence compared to that which
passes through the flap.
