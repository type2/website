Subject: Made my partition... '71 Westy

Just wanted to beam -

Made the partition today - turned out real nice. Sort of a big mushroom
shaped thing out of clear flexible vinyl secured along the top with
grommets and hooks and on the rest of the edges with velcro. Thing is
danged near air-tight! Hope it keeps out some of the nastyness up in
Maine this weekend! :)

What with that and new weatherstripping, insulation and a bunch of other
things, I am bound and determined not to freeze this winter! Look for an
ugly primer-red Westy headed north on '95 tomorrow!
