Subject: Re: [T2] Fabric for gold late bay Westy curtains

&gt; I have swatches of the Tumeric and Lettuce (very close match for the

Ok, I met up with ratwell earlier this week for lunch, and snapped a 
photo of his gold curtains next to a piece of this gold fabric.  See:

for more info and the photo.

Hope this is useful for someone!

(FWIW, I decided to order the Lettuce color for my replacement 
curtains.)
