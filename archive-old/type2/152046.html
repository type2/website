&gt; I have seen a few people mention that SAAB 900 bucket seats are a pretty

&gt; Anybody here actually done this? I guess you can wire up the seat heaters
&gt; and everything. I'm curious about how much fabrication is actually required,
&gt; and how much work is actually involved? I need to do something about the
&gt; seats in the mighty Westy. I would like to make it more &quot;bottom friendly&quot;
&gt; for long haul trips.

I have a 78 bus, (have gas heater, too but)  I have put Vanagon seats into
my bus it is a slide in swap.   I then have a &quot;bunk&quot; heater from a truck
stop and sit on it.  this works exactly like many seat heaters and while
not that pretty is very effective in keeping that part of the anatomy
comfortable even if I don't fire the gas heater, and it uses almost no
power.
