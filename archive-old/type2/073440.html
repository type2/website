&gt;&gt;Sorry, this is simply not true.  Basic maintennance does not Ensure
&gt;&gt;anything.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not talking about basic maintenance.

Hmmm... well above, you said, &quot;If you do not compromise basic maintenance
procedures, you are insuring success&quot;.  Did I read that wrong?

&gt;Parts do fail unexpectedly even when they are replaced at
&gt;&gt;sensible intervals.  Carrying spare parts is a smart thing to do IMO, DM or
&gt;&gt;no DM.

&gt;How many German engineers does it take to replace a light bulb???

I'll take that to mean that you are not disputing the &quot;carry spare parts&quot;
issue anymore.

p.s. Here's one the Germans tell about Americans:

How many Americans does it take to change a light bulb?
Six.  One to change the bulb and five to file the environmental impact
statement.

I'm not kidding, this was told to me by one of my German friends while I
was living over there.
