Subject: [T2] Are the tubes between intake air distributor and intake pipes same size?


&gt; oN 1700 AND 1800 ENGINES?  I can find them for the 1800 but not the
&gt; 1700.................
 
 Sounds like you are talking about the intake runners on fuel injected engines?

All USA 1700 bus engines have dual carbs.

914 and 411/412 1700 engines were injected.
