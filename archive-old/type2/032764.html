Subject: Re: Bus is PERFECT, except for...

A flat spot in acceleration can also be caused by a flat spot in the 
cam.  I'm not sure if this is what you are experiencing... But it is 
possible.  It can also be worn lifters.  If you are over 100 Grand in miles 
with out a rebuild and you have a habit of not tuning up often, changing 
oil or treating you motor with respect... it could be an internal problem.
I do suggest looking at the comments another person posted mentioning the 
jets of the cabrs first... and if that doesn't help... It might be time to 
look inside the case for the problem.
Cheers,

&gt; &gt;&gt;Guys,
&gt; &gt;&gt;Well, I spent some $$$$ on getting my bus working OK! WHAT a difference...
&gt; &gt;&gt;It takes off at the lights like a scalded cat! New points, condenser, 
&gt; plugs,
&gt; &gt;&gt;oil, air, oil &amp; fuel filters, etc... even a NEW window winder!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I just have one TEENSY problem... it STILL has a flat spot, when the go
&gt; &gt;&gt;button is pushed, nearly dies, THEN it takes off! Most frustrating!
&gt; &gt;&gt;Carbies, perhaps?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Any clues?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Acceleration enrichment prob., check alingment of accel. jets, accel.
&gt;jet(s) not fully seated, adjust accel. pump rod and quantity injected.
&gt;Accel. jets clogged. Stock distributor and timing??? Hung mechanical
&gt;advance??? Vacuum diaphram leak???? Mixture set just a bit lean????
&gt; &gt;Any small vacuum leaks, flanges, idle solinoid loose, worn throttle
&gt;shafts, imbalance of carbs???
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;All possables. Verify specs. for all. If it doesn't run just ding dang
&gt;descent with all stock components, something is not in spec.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you have non stock components, variation from best function is to be
&gt;expected. You must continue the experiment for improvement, or go back to
&gt;stock and put the problems behind you.
