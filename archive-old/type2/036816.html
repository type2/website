&gt;1) 79-83 bus cali fuel injection - the O2 sensor does not control mixture, 
&gt;it only helps with emissions. There is still a head temp sensor greatly 
&gt;contributing to the emissions.

untrue and true respectively

&gt;2) By adding the Air/fuel ratio guage and inline potentiometer to the head 
&gt;temp sensor, you trick the computer into thinking the engine is cold and it 
&gt;sends more fuel or pulses the injector longer. There is no need to mess with 
&gt;fuel pressure because fuel pressure has nothing to do with rich or lean, 
&gt;just maintaining the pulse pressure in the injector. If you want to send 
&gt;even more fuel, just step up to a bigger injector as long as it's made by 
&gt;bosch. Like say from a 2.3litre ford.

uh, untrue again, let's see problems being that the sensor is very nonlinear,
so as we want a basically proportional increase over the entire range for
the proportionally larger increase in air flowing, a set addition isn't
going to
work.  Also VERY untrue that fuel pressure has nothing to do with it, as I
recall dimly from the ole engineering days flow rate is a function of pressure
and area, so you can tinker with EITHER pressure or bigger injectors.  I think
the bigger injectors are the way to be sure, no need to stick to Bosch,
nothing mystical about them now days for certain, but it has to be an
equivalent injector in form factor and resistance.

&gt;3) to flow more air, get rid of the air box and strap a k&amp;n air filter to 
&gt;your AFM.

Ludicrous, the cross sectional area of the air box is monstrous (though
admittedly a small snorkel one could remove, but that won't help here
any more than it helped on my Corrado) the restriction is the AFM itself,
a VERY, VERY, tiny cross section.  As to the merits/demerits of a
K&amp;N I won't get into it, I've seen actual data to the demerits but have
many friends running them 250k mile engines, I've used em.

&gt;4) Those 96mm piston and cylinder kits are made in the USA

Asian.

&gt;5) Want to use stock pistons? Add a stroker crank to get 2156cc like I have 
&gt;with the mark stephens setup and HAUL ASS with no drivability problems.

Well that doesn't instantly work either, skirts may need clearanced.  As to
hauling ass, well Dolan's never impressed me much, strong but not all that
strong for the money, and longetivity is definitely more of a concern than
driveability either way.
