Chris
I just went through this with my 76. I suggest you do it yourself. The parts 
are cheap (esp if you order from Bus Depot_dot_com). Other listees have supplied 
great info as guidance. More  detailed instructions can be found here in the 
tech section. Also, follow some links to find other detailed step by steps. 
The advantage is obvious...you get to learn your Westy inside out...and you 
deepen your relationship with your bus as well...and...YOU did it. 
IF you don't have a Bentley Manual...buy one!
If you get &quot;stuck&quot;, wash your hands, and...get some help.
