&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; 
&gt; I drove my 73 westy through the cold snowy winter of 99/00 using a catalytic
&gt; propane heater while driving. The condensation on the windshield was a
&gt; severe PITA. After a week or two there was a noticable coating of frost ....
Combustion of fuel, be it propane or kerosene, will produce water vapor
and CO2 and maybe CO if incomplete combustion.  Back in 83 I contracted
my own post and beam home, and since the frame went up in winter, we
used a kerosene heater to work inside.  This was a foam enclosed tight
home, and one heater would keep it at 55 deg when it was 20-45 out, but
oh that water vapor- condensed on all the windows, then ran down over
the beams and stained them.......The lesson learned is you gotta vent or
reduce the possibility of condensation.  I used the black cat in the
van, and it puts out less vapor per hour than one of these &quot;glow red&quot;
propane heaters- but you must vent the bus the next day at least an
hourf with the windows open.  Remember cold air is dry, and the bus will
vent out the moisture.  It helps to make your own storm windows from
window film, impractical on windshild and front side windows.  You can
make a tight sealing curtain that separates the front (and crack those
windows) and operate the heater back by you.  Don't run it all night;
better to use more down insulation over you.  Your breath will add
plenty moisture.  Only true solution is a vented gas heater, or keep a
drum of anhydrous calcium chloride in the bus!
