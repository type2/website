All,

Here's the deal.

I never met or knew Josh other than from his post's to the LIST.

I can sum up what I knew about Josh in one paragraph.


Josh lived in Oklahoma. He said &quot;prolly&quot; instead of PROBABLY. He was
on the &quot;typeII list&quot; and he helped me fix my bus.

There. That's it.

Anything else that I may or may not feel is MY business and not up to
the list for discussion.


No matter what the circumstances, I think it was in EXTREME poor taste
for one of our &quot;list-members&quot; to check out the on-line obituaries for
Josh's city so that they could post the un-savory tid-bits of Josh's
death. 

Allow the guy, his familly and his REAL friends some grace, you
bastard. 

That was a cheap and cowardly shot. 

There's such a thing as grace and I suggest you learn it.


At any rate... for those of you who knew Josh; I'm truly sorry for
your loss. I'm especially sad for Josh, as he cheated only himself.


Jaime
