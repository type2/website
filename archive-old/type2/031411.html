&gt; Ok, I'm still trying to solve my Bus's oil leak.
&gt; 
&gt; I took off the Rubber Bellows (connects the dipstick guide pipe into the
&gt; crankcase) and it does indeed have a small tear.
&gt; 
&gt; First, I'm finding it difficult to believe that my Bus relies on this little
&gt; rubber piece to hold oil.

yup it does, and that is DM which is not always perfect

&gt; Second, does anyone know where to buy there?

Rocky Mountain Motor Works and Bus Depot have em, part number 021 119 245
at less than $4

&gt; Third, can anyone see any potential problems of just buying a quality hose
&gt; and some hose clamps to connect the guide pipe and crankcase.

some oils react with the hose material, I have used in an emergency a
spark plug boot, but it was just to limp home not long term

&gt; One other thing, all oil was drained out of my motor and my wife tried to
&gt; start it a couple of times with no oil in it before wisely parking it and
&gt; calling for help.  Would that allow gas to get into oil lines?

not likely to cause any damage if the engine did not start
