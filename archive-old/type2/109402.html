Subject: Heads/shims/gaskets Oh my

OK, I've looked through the archives and I see lots of various hints and
tips but I wanted to find out what the current thinking is on this.


I'm in the process of putting together my 2.0 GE 1979 engine, had the heads
cleaned and checked (not machined) and have new piston/liners on the way.
When putting the liners back on, do I use the metal shim gaskets that I
received with my rebuild kit from Bus Depot? Or are these shims supposed to
go between the head and the top of the piston liners?

Boston engine states : eliminate the head gasket and replace it with a 1.6mm
aluminum shim (#071 101 34), or a steel one, at the base of the cylinder
between the cylinder and crankcase.

But when I yanked the engine apart, the shims were not on the crank case,
rather in the head.

Do I do shims in both places?

All this talk about deck hight is confusing me! Since I didn't machine the
heads at all, the height shouldn't be affected right?
