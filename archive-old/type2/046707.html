Subject: [T2] front end squeek/squeal

i can't get up a comfy test drive on my break/bearing/caliper job.

i had a very prominant front end squeek that has evolved into a
more-on-than-off squeel. whether its related to the squawk going over speed
bumps is uncertain. this has nothing to do with the honk of the oregon
ducks breaking into the top 10.

the only thing i can determine is the one inch tear where the right lower
ball joint boot is torn. and it may well be that. whether this is causing
the sound i don't know. are there other things i can check myself between
the front tires to help isolate? here's what little i did yesterday: i
raised the front wheels and spun them by hand, and had my four year old hit
the break hard. nothing unusual, except that's when i saw the boot on the
ball joint. then i jumped up and down on the bumper and couldn't make
sounds. so, i can't even figure out how to make the sound while the bus is
still.

always appreciating and obliged
