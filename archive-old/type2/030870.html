&gt; Everytime I turn on my lights my alternater light comes on (faintly), when I
&gt; use my turn signal or brake, the Alt. light gets brighter.(Only with the
&gt; headlight switch on, NOT the parking lights, the Alt. light wont even
&gt; glimmer, Only with headlamps on,,,,,Hmmmmmm???
&gt;     ANYONE have any ideas???????

yeah mine did the same thing, finally after about 6 months of pulling my
hair out traced it to a wire in the fuse harness that was touching the
dimmer relay.  haven't beeen able to fix it but solved the problem by
pulling the relays forward just a hair.  easiest way to see if this is the
problem is to reach under the dash to the fuse panel, turn on things and
let the problem happen, then carefully pull the dimmer relay forward
towards the steering column.
    if that doesn't work the old trick I use is
to find a ammeter and take the fuse out and wire the ammeter accross the
terminals, put the ammeter right in front of your face and note when
exactly things happen.  may not pin point the problem but should at least
narrow things down
