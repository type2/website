That about sums it up.
I was on my way to Wally-World to buy some tools in our 70 micro . I pull up
to the busy intersection and apply the brakes fairly hard as the SUV in
front of me decided not to turn as they had indicated. Well instead of
stoping I sorta smacked the rear of the stupid thing.  Dohh!!  Well i thougt
perhalps i was going to fast although it didnt seem that way, After all I
just replaced the brake system last month.
Well there goes the all original damage free nose. The lady i hit was nice
about it and so was the highwaypatrol cop, considering i didnt have my
insurance papers with me. All was done, i climb in the cab, pply the brake
to start and what do i find..... very little pressure in the pedal. Come to
find out the rear passenger cylinder blew out and it only a month old. Oh
well , if it not one thing it another.
