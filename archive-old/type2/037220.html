correct me if i am wrong...

but dont type4's 79-83.5 have sodium filled exhaust valves that cool much
better?  i could be missing something... but i have been told if your
valves are sodium filled that is good and really stretches out the life of
valves.

I also thought if you have the seats in well (ala AVP), you can go longer
on a type4 than you could on a type1 between valve jobs...
