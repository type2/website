Subject: Re: [T2] follow up on refer battery question

&gt;I have verified the batteries on the deluxe westy are indeed isolated.
However if the aux battery is fully drained, when you turn the ignition to
start the batteries are reconnected and the aux battery pulls power from the
main.

Where do you have the relay 'close' wire connected? To the coil? If yes, this
is wrong. The relay 'close' wire is supposed to be connected to the alternator
stator output wire. This way, the relay will only close and transfer B+ when
the engine is running and the alternator is charging. Westy alternator
harness's have an extra wire in the harness between the alternator and
regulator that the regular buses do not have. If I remember right, it is a
black wire.
