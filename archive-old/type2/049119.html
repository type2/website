&gt; All four valves were about .004!!

This isn't all that bad.  Now if one clearance has been completely closed
I'd be worried!

Sinking seats wouldn't be a cause of blue smoke in any case.  Worn valve
guides perhaps, but more likely piston rings.

Keep an eye on the valve clearances.  If you have one that suddenly starts
closing up regularly you have a problem.
