Subject: IGNITION WOES

Hey Folks,

What a night mare!!!!! and it can happen to you!!!

You stop the bus, turn off the ignition, and remove the key.
When you return, and try to start the bus, you find that the key will
not turn. The steering wheel is in the locked position, and no matter
what  you do to the key or how many times you try to turn it on.   THE
KEY WILL NOT TURN.
It just so happens that when this happened to me I was at my local VW
shop, getting new brake light switches. I figured that I could invest
$25.00 in order to have brakes lights.
My mechanic took a look at the ignition switch tried it a few times the
he suggested that we tap it.
After tapping the ignition box lightly with a BFH and attempting to free
up any stuck parts with no luck. I decided to have a new key made
thinking this may help the old  lock..
WELL, $7.00 later  I had a new key  and a still a dead bus. The mechanic
that works on the bus suggested that HE drill out the lock. Thus saving
the ignition housing. (Volkswagen only sells the ignition switch, not
the entire housing) This is where the problem begins.
In order to get the ignition out you must drill a hole in the housing.
The bus is in show room condition and I didn't want him to drill any
holes any where.(all the original german stickers are like new condition
and the one on the ignition is perfect). We negotiated a price for the
replacement of the ignition and I left. Price: $100.00 including parts.
When I returned I found the man in a pool of sweat and my ignition
switch still in the housing. The steering wheel and the column had been
removed and the parts were on the work bench. When I looked at the
ignition. It looked as though a bad thief had tried to break into the
switch. The beautiful stickers were all F****d up and the housing had
TWO
holes in it.  I went ape S*** and he said that he didn't know if he
could complete the job.
due to lack of parts replacement.  I told him that WE would finish it
together. I went into
his office and called the local wrecking yard and luck being with me
they had just received
a 73 Westy and had the complete ignition and housing, less any keys.
Cost: $ 30.00 I then called a number of locksmiths to find one that
could make a key for the new(old) part.
A company named Speedylock in Walnut Creek, CA and the tech named J.D
had the holed drilled (very small) and the lock out within 10 min. I
gave him the original key as he
requested and he made the ignition the same as all my doors. Still only
one key.
Cost: $ 90.00 but worth every penny. He didn't scratch any part of the
housing and the sticker that is on the new one is in great condition.
I took the part back to the shop and the mechanic went to work on
putting everything back together. He changed all parts (as I watched and
helped) including a new ignition switch(the electronic part) tested all
functions, replaced two burnt bulbs, fixed my license plate light (it
had a short in it) put in two brake light switches,
He put in 3-4 hours of shop time. He explained each step and each wire
and what they controlled.
Total cost: $140.00 parts and labor
I would have paid twice that much for the education I received from him
on my bus.
I helped very little, but I feel like I know every step as though I had
done them myself.
If your in the Concord, CA area I would like to recommend;
Concord  Import Service

Peter is the owner and the mechanic

Thanks for time and start looking for a locksmith. :-)
