 1) What is meant by the Type2 , Type4 etc...?
type 2 is just a normal bus, not to be confused with Transporter2 which are 
buses from 68 to 79, or.vanagons (80-91) are transporter 3's

type 4 is the engine in buses from 72-83 (except desiel vanagon)
this engine origonaly came from the failed type 4 sedan. i.e. 411 412's dont 
ask me what they are, ive never seen one.. this engine was also used in 
porsche 914's which is a sweet little car but not built for tall people

 2) I have an 82 Westy, what type is it?
i think it would be a type 2, but i dont think anyone calls them that, just 
vanagon's

 3) Right now my Westy runs really strong but is pretty rough when cold.  Is 
 that normal?  How long should I let is warm up?   &gt;&gt;

probably not, never ever owned a fi bus,  off the top of my head id say cold 
start injector's bad. Thats just a wild guess though. Any Fi people out there?
