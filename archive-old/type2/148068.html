Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Replacement - HELP!

I usually find that the pot metal shaft that fits into the plastic
electrical switch wears and will not throw the switch far enough to
make contact for starting. I tried shimming the first one I
encountered and the fixes weren't durable, so I finally ended up
replacing the cylinder.

&gt; Does the OEM ignition locks fail in such a way that their rotation is
limited after wear sets in? The Riv in question only has a documented 75K
miles on it. Of course the van could have been started and stopped 17 times a
day but I doubt it (original motor, tranny, brakes but not pads).
