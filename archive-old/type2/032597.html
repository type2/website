Ok, now I'm getting really confused. So there was originally a gas heater?
Where would this heater have been installed? Not under the seat? Also, I
haven't found any openings to the rear of the vehicle from the passenger
compartment, so I'm not sure how this all fits together. Any pointers to
where I can get more info?

The push pull knob is the temp control for a gas heater. If you don't has
one then it has been disconnected. It would have a cable that runs to where
the warm air comes in under your rear seat.
