Subject: Window Removal

I'm still working on my driver door. I attempted to take out the window
today so I could remove the seals to finish removing the paint along the
edges and spray on some primer. I followed the steps in my haynes manual,
but I couldn't remove the window crank system. It got caught inside the door
on the section I took a picture of. In the manual it says just remove the
screw, but from what I could see I need to remove something else inside. I
just couldn't figure out what. I didn't want to force it and mess up
something.
