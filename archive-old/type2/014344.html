Subject: closing in on e-brake

Re: adjusting emergency brakes.

I got my rear brakes adjusted and they have a good
amount of lining. But the left one runs out of
adjustment threads on the emergency brake handle
double-nut thing-- and still doesn't engage. Right
side holds bus on a hill, but it comes out more than
six clicks...

Am i missing sumthing? Stretched cable, unhooked
cable, duh?
