Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator

I think bus depot has it.. or whatever that big online bus store is.  I
was looking for a new one for the same reason, but I found a good one on
my other engine.  It makes a big difference because that tear allows
unmetered air into the manifold!

later,
Mike

&gt; Hi list
&gt; 
&gt; I just removed the auxiliary aire regulator (valve?) from my 78 EFI.
&gt; There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in
&gt; diameter. There is a quite a bit tear in it. This might explain why the
&gt; engine stops after 30 seconds unless I unplug the AFM. Would that black
&gt; rubber elbow be something we could find at a FLAP?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for you input.
