Subject: Re: [T2] Frustration sets in due to timing woes on 72 bus

I just answered this on the samba!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; Hey here's the scoop: I bought a 72 bus a few weeks back for $200 and it runs great but had major
acceleration issues. So a great smooth idle,
instant starting etc... But it would barely accelerate once I got changed from 1st to 2nd etc. So I checked
the vacuum advance and it was ruptured. So I replaced with the exact #925 that goes with the 73 distributor .
I checked and double checked it is a 73 distributor and is timed at 10 degrees ATDC not like the 5 degrees
that the 72 one is timed at.....
So when I got the new vacuum advance in place and got the distributor
back in the engine, I checked out my timing. Now my strobe light is non
functional at the moment, so I am just trying to get the timing in the
close vicinity of 10 ATDC, so I am using a test light and doing the static
deal...
And to make a long story as short as possible here's what the deal is:

 My engine will not run when the distributor is set at 10 ATDC!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You CANNOT static time a dual vacuum advance distributor to the specs listed.

You have to time it with a timing light AND have vacuum going to the retard side.

If you want to be close, then SUBTRACT the amount of retard degrees from 10 after. I believe the 925 is
supposed to be 16-18 degrees of retard at idle. Subtracting 18 from 10 after will mean you need to static time
it at 8 before. [if you look up the specs for any single vacuum unit type4 distributor, you will notice that
the timing is 7.5 before.....]

Set your timing at 7.5-8 before. Start the engine. Does either vacuum hose have vacuum at idle? If one does,
where does it go on the dist? It must go to the inboard nipple. Connect it. Does the idle slow down? It
should. If the engine wants to die now, then you need to do some carb adjustments.
