Go with the gas heater.  Can't get enough heat electrically, the van only
has about 75 amps from the alternator,a hair dryer, for instance, draw's
1500 watts.

The heater you want is the BA6.  If the late model bus you are going to pull
it from is stock, this iw what it will have.  I have no idea its value, make
your best deal.  Its underneath vans from 74 through 84, as they were in
vanogons as well.  Make sure you know how to pull it, and that you get all
the bits.  There is an article on this at www.type2_dot_com  Look in the
Library, under &quot;Heating&quot;, and you will find an article on installing a BA6
out of a wrecker.

Biggest drawback with BA6 or BN4 for that matter, is that you can't get ANY
new parts, so if you put one in, start hording spare components.

As for safety, it will be safe if you put in the proper fuses and the safety
relay.  In otherwords, examine the  manual and put it in stock set up.  the
safety system has a number of redundancies.  From there, its a matter of
maintaining it properly, particularly keeping it from rusting out, keeping
the combustrion chamber and glow plug clean, and making sure there is a
working exhaust pipe as the air from the exhaust is very hot and can cause
damage if not properly ported away.  You may need to fabricate something.
It is important that the body of the heater is intact without rust, dents or
cracks.  If so, it should be fine, but be your own judge.

There is a manual for the BA6 online at:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/eber/index.html

Test each component before you buy the thing.  The manual will be of
assistance in doing this.

Also, search the archives, as this is a common subject in the posting.

Subject: [T2] HEATERS - Ceramic, Gas, and Stock


     In my on going quest to kep my 76 bus warm for the winter months I have
been wondering what step I should take next.  Right now I'm waivering
between the cigarette lighter/ceramic heater vs. a gasoline heater available
in a local wrecking yard.  I am also having trouble getting the stock system
in top shape.

My questions are as follows:

1.  What sense would there be in getting the ceramic heater.  How noisy,
expensive, effective, would it actually be vs. my other options.  I know I
don't see a lot of discussion about them on the list, I was just wondering
if there was a reason for this.

2.  I unfortunately don't know the exact model number for the gas heater I
have available.  I do know it came from a late model bus.  What would be a
reasonable price for a used heater given that all of the ducts, switches and
parts were available AND it worked properly?

3.  I hear repeated success stories from the gas heater users and don't
doub't their ability to make a vw warm.  My question however is pertaining
to whatever disadvantages they might have.  Is there any chance of carbon
monoxide poisoning?  What precautions would be taken to avoid this and how
reliable are they?  Also how do they compare to the electric heaters in
terms of both power draw and niose?  Is the installation procedure worth the
amount of work necassary?

4.  My stock system is just that... stock, however there is one problem that
has been hampering its abilities.  The heater cable that operates the valve
to turn on the defroster/front vent/rear vent slips in and out of the small
hole that connects it to the valve underneath the vehicle (approxmitaly
underneath the bench seat).  Cosequently it fails to go completely open or
closed so there is a weakened amount of air going to the defroster or visa
versa. If there is any advice anyone could provide on trying to get the
cable to stay firmly attached to the valve I would appreciate it.

5.  Obviously I am open to other suggestions as well.  If you have any ideas
that havn't been posted in recent threads please let me know.
