Subject: RE:  Tape Deck for My 79

Travis::::

Man, what's wrong with the SONY??

I gather you are looking for a cassette receiver, not just a cassette deck.  
If you are just looking for the deck portion, and not the radio/cassette 
receiver, then I can't advise.


Crutchfield_dot_com has a Kenwood KRC-2007 for $99.99 (NIS) with minimal wattage 
(15x2), but it is a shaft mount vice DIN sleeve so it might fit fine.  (Also 
check out the Blaupunkt St Louis C32   22 watts at $89.99  Might need to be 
shoe horned in.  AT that price, you could cut the radio, not the dash ! ! 
!))

You could add an amp to hear the music, but no rear speaker setup (fade) 
like the SONY!!!

But with the dial for the volume, it is a bit easier to keep the music in 
competition with the road/engine noise.


I found my SONY replacement on ebay.  Paid $45 or so for the $90 radio 
cassette receiver because that was all I could find that would fit.

PS.  What do you mean by 'multiple ground wiring' and why is that 
'complicated'.

  Hey All,
  Beyond the garage sale circuit, can anyone recommend a starting point for
  finding a good new or used cassette deck for my 79 bus?  I have a Sony in
  there but the tape deck portion has since ceased to operate, and I'd 
rather
  not replace it with another Sony due to the crappy luck I've had with that
  brand's products.  I don't want to deal with any of the fancy newish
  stereos, as they seem now to require more complicated multiple ground 
wiring
  and no one seems to make straight simple tape decks anymore anyway.  I'm
  assuming an older Blaupunkt might fit and work....does anyone know of any
  other brands of tape decks that will go right into the stock radio hole 
for
  a 79?
