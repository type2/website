regarding the white vs yellow gas. In Canada gas is (Was at least) dyed
according to its tax status.
This boiled down to whether or not the road tax portion of the taxes was
paid.

Car gas was yellow
Farm gas which is purchesed without paying the road tax because it would be
used in farm equipment off road, 
or by farm vehicles on the road which have a special tax status was blue if
I remember right.
Construction gas is similar to farm gas?
Aviation gas was yet another color.

The taxman got downright irate if the gas in your private vehicle tank was
the wrong color;-(

Bill Crick
Yellow 76 Type II/IV/VII with yellow gas. The heavy water is not dyed
because my brother in law brings
it home from the nuclear plant in his thermos;-)
