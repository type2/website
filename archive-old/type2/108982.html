Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

&gt; Dennis Kozlowski and Kenneth Lay certainly spread the love all over a
bunch of decent folks who, foolishly, had hopes of retirement at a decent
age. Fools!

Yes.. Fools! The men they trusted were criminals, not capitalists, in my
opinion. Real capitalists create value, and try to give at least equal to
what they get. Wolves wear all manner of clothing to hide the fact of who
they are and what they are after. Wolves dress in ministers robes, business
suits, and they occupy political offices and hold agency jobs. Everyone is
after your money. That may not be 100% true, but it is, in my opinion, the
only safe assumption. When we can come to grips with the fact that most
people are selfish and that this is a natural condition for man and other
conditions (just as a dog protects his food), we can dispense with the
foolish notion that anyone can be trusted. We are ultimeately responsible
for ourselves, and THAT is a message that lends empowerment when it is fully
understood and accepted. Somewhere in the New Testament (I am not a &quot;chapter
and verse&quot; person) it admonishes Christians: &quot;Be ye wise as serpents, but
gentle as doves.&quot; In other words, be good to people, but don't be their
fool, either.
