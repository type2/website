Subject: Looking for a Clutch Housing

I'm looking for a clutch housing

I'm building an engine stand to run my engine outside the bus.  I need a
clutch housing to make it easier to connect engine and starter.

If anyone has a bad/scraped late model tranny, must be manual tranny,
that they would be willing to give up the clutch housing for some
finacial reimbursement, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks
Brent
