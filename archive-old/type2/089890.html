&lt;&lt; Any bay bus headrest will fit any bay seat from 73 to 79. They will not fit

Vanagon seats. The posts on Vanagons are smaller in diameter.

I have pairs in almost every color EXCEPT black. I have soft vinyl and hard

vinyl. 73-only is very hard to find. Black is very hard to find. The most

common hard vinyl is brown.

Fabspray, man. by Zynolyte Products Co., Compton CA., makes a reason-
able vinyl color spray. Follow the directions on the can and viola!, black
headrests...
