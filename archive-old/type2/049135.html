Subject: [T2] Wiring blower

Hey volks, 
                  Thanks for all the heating advice, i chose to make the most 
of my stock system and have been pretty sucessful in doing so. At highway 
speeds i have very decent heat but around town i could use a bit more. I 
found a boat dealer with bilge blowers and i'm going to pick one up. I could 
use the advice of some of you who have installed them including exactly the 
best place for it along with what steps to take to wire it to the fuse box. 
Mind you i'm very far from a novice electrician.   Thanks, Jay
