Subject: Re: [T2] Body Panel Compatability (71-78)

&lt;&lt; I need to replace the passenger rear quarter panel on my 78
Westy.  My body guy has found a 71 with a clean (no rust) panel.
Will it swap?  Are there any differences, i.e. air vent, gas
filler, etc.?  Also, the panel will have to include the
corner/back to a vertical line just before the engine and back
hatches.  The topmost horizontal cut will be just below the
sliding door rail. &gt;&gt;

'71 gas filler has a cover/door, the tail lights are different,
and (since the engine changed in '72) the inner body is probably
different...Probably best to look around for the later year than
try to adapt this to that...
(Tho' if I had my druthers, I'd rather have a '71 body with the
'78 engine, trans, and access hatch... ;-)
