Subject: Re: missing vacuum line

&gt; I was looking at my engine yesterday and I noticed a stray vacuum line.
The
&gt; line starts at the distributor and immediately hits a T then one goes
&gt; straght to the front of the engine and hooks a right and hooks up to a
&gt; doodad on the efi. This one is about 14&quot; long and goes straight across the
&gt; engine towards the battery. Any idea where it goes? I figure it should
hook
&gt; up the engine block. Might improve my timing if the vacuum is increased,
but
&gt; I can't find a fitting anywhere? Help!

You have 2 types of vacuum.
One is ported vacuum. Ported vacuum comes from above the throttle plate and
appears when you open the throttle. Ported vacuum is used for the vacuum
advance and the EEC purge valve.
The other is manifold vacuum. Manifold vacuum is available at idle. When you
open the throttle, manifold vacuum drops then comes back. This is why it is
connected to vacuum retard [but not on your 78]. It also goes to the decel
valve and the fuel pressure regulator.
Your 78 should have a ported line coming off the front of the throttle
housing going to a tee. From this tee, one line goes to the distributor and
the other goes to the purge valve on the back of the air cleaner. The large
hose on the purge valve goes to the right end of the charcoal cannister.
When ported vacuum appears, the purge valve opens and the syphon effect thru
the air cleaner draws the gas fumes from the charcoal cannister into the
engine. [The left side large hose comes from the left end of the fan housing
and the fan helps push air thru the cannister also, but when A/C is
added....this hose is worthless]. Make sure this diaphragm doesn't
leak....it will rob the vacuum from the advance unit. The purge valve is not
available separate...you have to replace the back half of the air cleaner ;(
You also have a manifold vacuum line coming off the nipple on the right side
of the plenum, between runners 1 and 2 to a tee. Off this tee is one line
going to the decel valve on the gas tank panel, to the right of the charcoal
cannister. And a second line going to the fuel pressure regulator, in front
of #1 spark plug.
On the right end of the charcoal cannister is a small nipple. NO vacuum goes
to it. The hose that goes there connects to the tee where both vent lines
meet above the engine, to the rear of the heater blower.
