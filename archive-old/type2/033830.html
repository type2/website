Subject: where in heck is the 'baton?'

The Great Bus Tour Baton, that is... I know it is in the SEast, and should
go north and then south again, but the web page hasn't been updated in 3
months.
Also, could someone clue us down-winders what all we are getting into and
what to bring? It sounds like we'll have busses full of stuff to transfer,
what with cameras, tapes, souvenir boxes and what not :)
