Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay FS, Baltimore

just a quick note I thought I remembered someone looking for one of these
in the area.  in any case this is a 10/10 sighting.  I was in a hurry so
couldn't stop but pulled onto the shoulder and drove by at 10MPH,

Early Bay (low turn signals) recent paint job, blue/white fair to decent,
everything appears there except rear bumper no visible body damage, no
visible rust damage (suspicious in this area)  no broken glass.

is located on the East side of Rt 40 (Pulaski hwy) Between White Marsh and
Joppatown if anyone is seriously interested I will go back and get more
details via p-mail
