&gt; That's IT!! You're correct!! Not that I knew the answer, but connecting the
&gt; dots, you are exactly right. I recently filled up a couple of days ago with
&gt; an ENTIRE tank of 87 Octane. When I first bought it, I had put about a 1/4
&gt; tank of 92 Octane, but I nearly emptied the tank, and then filled it back up
&gt; with all 87.

&gt; 2.  You really need to burn higher octance gas or use a lead additive like
&gt; &quot;gunk&quot;  If I burn 87 octance I disel day or night. If I go up to 93...it
&gt; never ever happens...simple as that..

I've found that my 78 needs 89 octane min so I just either go to Sunoco
and get 89 or mix 91 and 87 to get approx 89
