Subject: What is the List Convention re: Pricing

Volks-

I'm looking for a late 1970s Westy, and I came across this posting today:  
 ------------------------------
 1. ...a 1977 Westfalia overnighter/hard top...asking $4,500 firm.
 2. ...a 1978 VW transporter...asking $3,200 firm....
 ------------------------------

So my questions to all the virual inhabitants of the community here is:

What is the convention for listing prices here?

If the price is &quot;asking&quot;, can one assume that there MAY be some room for
negotiation?

If the price is &quot;firm&quot;, can one assume that the owner will NOT sell it
for any lower price?  (Of course, this may mean that the current owner
will NOT sell it at all.)

It follows that:

What in the hell does &quot;asking $xxxx firm&quot; mean?


I'm not wanting to split hairs, but before I begin to spend energy, time
and money to track down the object of my desires (a late 1970s
Westfalia), I'd like to know a bit more about the actual selling
conditions.  Perhaps I am expecting too much.

Confused (as usual),
