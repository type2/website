Subject: Re: GEX engine comments

I bought a 1600 SP engine from GEX about 10 years ago. Put it in a 69
Westy. It came *with* a flywheel. It was too stiff to check endplay.
After a few hundred miles I was able to check end play. It was enormous.
I pulled the engine and adjusted endplay with shims. Everything was fine
for about 35k. Then one of the heads loosened and cracked. I pulled the
engine and replaced head. I sold the Westy about 2 years and I've talked
to the current owner this year. The engine is still plugging along and
now has about 80k on it.

My conclusion: GEX was not perfect, but not bad.
