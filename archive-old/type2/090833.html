Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temps and FMBC thanks

*I dont know where i got the 230 number from. *
I don't know where in cyber space that these temperature numbers come
from but I'm thinking that many more automobiles come with oil coolers
than at anytime in the past. 
This tells me that although some of the old rules may no longer apply but
operating temperatures relating to the oil temperature is a serious
concern for many modern auto makers.
Most motor homes I've owned or traveled in have had both transmission and
oil coolers.
If we relate to the fact that many of us are operating engines that are
as old as 30 years its becomes clear that some oil characteristics have
changed during those years. In general the motor oils have improved as
driving conditions have become more extreme and harder on engines,
whether it be at highway speeds or sitting in traffic.
I've driven a few Japanese imports and they get their peak horsepower at
high rpms, a few trips into passing gear made me think of high rpm
motorcycles.
The VW engines are relatively low Rpm engines by modern standards and
this promotes lugging when climbing hills or fighting head winds, they
just don't support the rpms to keep the oil pressure up under this severe
loading condition. 
In the Japanese cars they just downshift and climb at higher Rpms which
keeps the oil pressure high.
I often think of these high rpm engines as *may pops* since that is what
I expect when I've got one nailed to the floor.
Since this dissertation is going nowhere, its time to cut it off.
