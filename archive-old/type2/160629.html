Subject: RE: [T2] UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

Vacuum leaks happen.  90% of the time it is because the mechanic had their
hands back in the  engine compartment for any number of reasons.  SO, check
around the work that you did.  for me, I replaced my left bank of fuel
injectors, and I put 2&quot; FI lines at the top of the FIs.  This extra 1/2&quot;
length caused my left bank of FIs to not seat properly and as things worked
themselves over a 2k mile time, I developed vacuum leaks right at the
smaller FI seals, where they seat in the manifold.

Now-a-days, my '76 has a recirculation hose that goes from the charcoal
cannister on the firewall right ovethe engine to the fan housing and
connects right at the base of the coil.  That clear hose has taken a
specific form over the years.  Now I find it difficult to keep it on both
the fan housing and the charcoal cannister.

Sometimes when the smaller vacuum hoses get real old and brittle, they will
break when they are bumped.

On my '78, I have a vacuum line running from a 'T' on the air distribution
box, snaked under the bus to the front, and the up into the glove
compartment.  I have a vacuum gauge connected at the front, and it sits in
my ashtray, te line poking out of my glove compartment.  I watch this gauge
constantly.

A few months past I noticed the needle vibrating about + and - a few degrees
/ inches.  It was an indication of worn valve guides.  However, the
vibration is no longer there.  Just something to note.  When i take my foot
off the accelerator, the vacuum needle immediately jupms to 22, and pegs
right there.  My decel valve is working.  When i run uphill, pedal to the
floor, the needle goes to 0 sometimes, and about 3-5 recently.

Some thoughts.
