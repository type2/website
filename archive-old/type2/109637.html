FWIW- My Pertronix has treated me very well so far, but did require a few
minutes worth of filing to fit.  Dwell is rock-steady at 50.

PS- The DAEMON keeps rejecting my posts for too much quoting.  I'm not quoting
excessively; just enough to provide context for those other than the original
poster.  Could the DAEMON be turned down a notch?

&gt; So, now I'm looking at getting either pertronix or compu-fire.  I'm
&gt; looking at getting a Compu-Fire unit, and I'm just curious if it still
&gt; requires filing the bottom of the rotor?  I also read that the pertronix
&gt; isn't as durable.  It seems like both the the Compu-fire and the
&gt; Pertronix have their little quirks so I don't know which one to pick.  I
&gt; like the compufire design... hmmm... any thoughts?
