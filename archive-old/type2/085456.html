Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Two Wheel Trailor Sale!!

Jon Syder sends:

&gt; Up on the playa last year I met some folks that had a folding two
&gt; wheel trailer that they towed behind their non-westy vanagon to bring
&gt; their yurt and camping gear. It folded just aft of the axel so it could be
&gt; stored vertically.  When placed vertically behind their van the tow bar
&gt; was hardly over the roof line as I recall.  It looked practical for the
&gt; size loads I would feel comfortable towing behind my van (not too big) and
&gt; would be out of the way when not in use. Does anyone know where these can
&gt; be purchased? Jon

Harbor Freight has them.
