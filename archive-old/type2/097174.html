Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Brake problem.

My guess is that the fluid should be completely replaced. Did you mention if
you have rotors in the front or what year this is?  Just want to be sure. I
would think that the fluid is reacting to heat and expanding..which would of
course not be normal for good fluid. But if you had a little water moisture
in the fluid then this could be possible. I don't know how that steam, under
pressure, will not compress further, but I am sure it could cause pressure
build up in your lines and it could cause the brakes to grab. As to where
the water might have come in, maybe you put in contaminated fluid without
knowing it. Brake fluid will draw air moisture unless it is kept capped, and
over time, it degrades in the lines. The heat that the fluid seems to be
reacting to could be quite normally introduced by the interaction and
contact between rotor and caliper assemblies, and/or to a lesser extent your
shoes and drums.
I'm sure that you don't have anti-lock, but I want to mention this in case
it may save someone some very big money someday. We have a '91 Ford F250 PU,
and it has antilock. My husband was driving everyday to work, about 60 miles
a day, and sometimes saw the antilock warning sign on the dash, but didn't
think much of it. Too busy to look into it, he was. Well, sometime later, we
found out that this was caused by dirt/crud in the antilock device, and this
was automatically applying pressure to the brakes. We were going through
caliper pads and shoes pretty fast. Worse, a newly rebuilt transmission
(paid $2,000 to have rebuilt at a very good shop..100% honest), was toast,
three years after we had it redone. It should have lasted ten years. The
linings were all gone.. or more accurately, clogging the transmission
filter. The bill to rebuild it was $1,700+ (I think the shop owner took pity
on us and gave us a break). I guess that we can all fall into the trap of
ignoring early warnings, especially when we are busy. This turned out to be
a very big deal. And I would like to point out three things.. Don't ignore
early warning signs, watch out for this particular problem in cars with
antilock systems, and be prepared to replace that antilock switch, but you
can test for this and possibly still operate the vehicle safely, while
temporarily prevent damage and strain to your transmission, by unplugging
the electrical connection to that unit.
