this is a highly technical engineering term!

&gt; Within the last 2 weeks, my shift coupler sheared, the pin
&gt; holding the clutch cable to the pedal sheared, my window stopped
&gt; working (bad in the monsoon season) and my engine has started shutting
&gt; down while I'm tooling down the Interstate. I'm thinking it's more crud
&gt; in my fuel tank coming home to roost.
&gt; 
&gt; At 152,000 miles, I'm starting to wonder if the Bus isn't starting to
&gt; tell me it wants to rest &lt;grin&gt;

it's telling you it now finally trusts you enough to fix it right

&gt; What is the correct vehicle to transition to after owning a VW Bus for 7
&gt; years?
&gt; Another bus? :)

another bus is an unknown, the one you have now has known problems..if you
want to change to another bus do it for a reason, like wanting a Westy or
something
