Subject: Re: [T2] Loaf of Bread

I have both bases covered.  I have a '96 Passat GLX(4 door sedan) for 
driving fast and cornering, and the bus for a slow, liesurely drive.  Why 
limit yourself to just one style of driving?

Well, I was pondering the other day why I, an unabashed car nut, enjoy  
driving my breadloaf so much.  I've owned several sports cars and  muscle 
cars and I like going fast.  Especially around tight  corners.  I've been 
bored sick driving most economy cars and  passenger sedans.  My favorites 
are actually high-performance  four-door sedans.  My Taurus SHO was hot.
