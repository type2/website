Subject: [T2] Re: Murder Investigation - Kristin Ann Laurite

Following up to myself: the investigator is Cleve Keeling and his number
is (501) 354-2411. Please contact this gentleman and give any help you
can if you had any contact with Kristin Laurite.

&gt; Not sure how much of this is being cross-posted so some stuff you've
&gt; read may be re-stated:
&gt;
&gt; A woman named Kristin Laurite who was traveling cross-country in a VW
&gt; Bus was murdered near an Interstate rest area near Conway, Arkansas this
&gt; weekend. From the following news story the implication is that this
&gt; happened Sunday the 27th but from talking to Charlie Ford I think it
&gt; actually happened on Saturday:
&gt;
&gt;         http://thecabin_dot_net/stories/082800/sta_0828000041.html
&gt;
&gt; Ms. Laurite was traveling from the Northeast to California and she had a
&gt; printout of the AIRS roster in her van. If you are registered with AIRS
&gt; and you were on her route you may be getting a call from a police
&gt; agency. They are anxious to find anybody who might have talked with her
&gt; while she was traveling. From what I can tell they DO NOT suspect that
&gt; anybody on the AIRS list had anything to do with her death whatsoever.
&gt;
&gt; I believe she was in Memphis on Saturday morning and a member of the
&gt; type2 list worked on her bus for her (he had posted to the type2 list
&gt; about her carburetor problems). She traveled west from there.
&gt;
&gt; Again, there is NO REASON to believe that ANY of us did ANYTHING but
&gt; offer help to this young lady. I say that because the familiar &quot;Internet
&gt; implication snowball&quot; is beginning to roll downhill on at least one of
&gt; the mailing lists.
&gt;
&gt; There is an Officer Keeling of the Conway Police Department who wants to
&gt; talk to anybody who may have spoken with Ms. Laurite. I don't have his
&gt; number but Charlie Ford does, I'll make sure it gets posted to all
&gt; appropriate fora if he doesn't. Laurite left a mother who is surely in
&gt; agony and Charlie is going to try to contact her and see if there is
&gt; anything we can do to help.
