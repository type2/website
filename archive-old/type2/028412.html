Try to find Sami Dakhlias page. Here is his email.
[mailto:sdakhlia_at_cba.ua_dot_edu] He is a listperson and did a very tidy dash.
There is a combo guage, VDO make them for aviation and sports cars. not
cheap. Older Brit cars sometimes have a comb. in Smiths guages.
 That hole fits a type 3 clock nicely, they never work of course, and if you
can find a 4&quot; VDO tacho. then Bus depot has an adapter. This dash and
instrument thing can drive you nuts btw. temp, press and volts seem to be
it. Tacho for the seriously sound insulated.

&gt;
&gt; I have a spare place for a gauge (where the clock would usually
&gt; go), and was
&gt; wondering what is suggested? I am thinking Oil Temp VDO gauge. It
&gt; would be nice
&gt; to have an oil pressor gauge as well. I figure that when that oil
&gt; light comes on
&gt; it might be a little late. Do they make a combo gauge? Any help is greatly
&gt; appreciated.
