Subject: Re: [T2] Build or Buy?

I bought an AVP rebuilt late last year and put it in myself and had some problems with it. I'm not going to point fingers here 'cos the van runs fine now.

One good way to avoid my problem is to have a reputable local shop put in a new engine for you. They don't have to rebuild the engine themselves. They can get it from folks at AVP or elsewhere. The point here is that they will be able to work with the engine rebuilder to resolve any issue that may arise.
