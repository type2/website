Thanks for all the great advice. I don't think it'll be a problem to cancel
the order, but if it is, well, I'll just be out $26 and have a gallon of
paint to make my garage walls match the bus...and in that enamel, they
should wipe down easily when I blow an oil seal on the test stand, right?
;-) Too bad the bus is too tall to fit in the garage...the curse of owning a
Riviera; it's just a few inches taller than a westy. Funny thing, I'm
absolutely positive a westy would fit.

You all have convinced me not to use this house paint on the bus--the
chia-bus imagery was the clincher. While I'm trying to save $, there's no
sense in being pound-foolish. Truth is, I'm just really ignorant about the
properties of paint and paint systems, etc.

While I'm not too worried about colors, what I had in mind was to get some
color-matched paint and then knock out the rust a little at a time. I
figured this would amount to stripping rust and primer-coating on Friday or
Saturday; followed by smoothing out and putting on an outer-coat on Sunday.
While I'm not particularly vain about my vehicles (I like them paid-for and
dependable thankyouverymuch), given a choice, I'd also rather not stand out
like a sore thumb either...or have everyone in Memphis think I'm from
Mississippi. ;0) I don't really have the option of taking the bus down for a
month while I do painting and body work, but if I isolate areas, it'll be
easy for me to make significant inprovements in small steps. Overall, the
body on this '72 is straight and solid and the paint buffs out pretty true
to the original color.

Along with saving money, I want to avoid using drying agents and other such
nonsense that require a respirator. I don't have a respirator or a $450
respirator fund. I've got a mask with canister filters...and I can hold my
breath for a really long time. ;) So I guess what I need is an automotive
paint and a matching primer that will spray on with a basic spray gun...and
not kill me in the process. Ideally, this paint will match pretty close to
the original color of the bus.

Guess I'll talk to the local automotive paint shops and see what I can scare
up. In the meantime, I need to adjust my budget some, I suppose.

Thanks! Joe
'72 Riviera (Fyn)
