Subject: Re: [T2] First Ride

&gt;&gt; Would it hurt to adjust the steering box? &lt;&lt;

eliminate all other sources of play in the steering
_before_ adjusting the steering box.

here are the ones i can think of. i'm sure someone else
can add a few more.

-coupling
-tie rods
-steering damper

&gt;&gt;Are Gas ____'s available at WalMart or a FLAPS,
 or specialty shop?  I can
get the OEM's after a few big jobs start paying off.&lt;&lt;

you can get the OEM Boge replacements from Bus Depot for
about 100 bucks. i've installed 2 sets of these &amp; they
were well worth the money.

good luck,
