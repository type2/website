Have you greased your track and all hinges?

Also if you take your sliding door panel off-I beleive there is an adjuster 
on the cable for the door handle.

this happening in my 71 and I greased the track and all hinges and now 
everything pops open and closes alot better.

In my old 71 we had to do the cable pull to open the door only cuz we had 
adjusted the cable all the way.

I would assume that the alignment and everything is not out of wack.  if the 
above doesn't work re-adjust.
Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!

&gt;on my 69 westy, my door latches..umm, wont.
&gt;the worst offender is the rear one on the sliding door, closely followed by
&gt;the front one...when you slide the door shut, it likes to pop open again
&gt;(often just the rear will pop out, and the door stays semi-shut) when
&gt;closing it takes several tries to get everything shut
&gt;
&gt;sometimes when opening the door, the latches wont open and its necessary to
&gt;open from the inside by holding the handle in the open position and 
&gt;punching
&gt;the area behind the rear latch
&gt;
&gt;any ideas on how to remedy this?
&gt;thanx
