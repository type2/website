Subject: Westfalia campers

Hi all,

     I am going to look at my first camper tomorrow.  It is a 76 Westy.  The
owner says it has a sink &amp; a ice box but no stove or fridge.  Is this
correct?  Are there different levels of equipment in different Westies?  I
have had many buses but never a camper.  Any advice or suggestions would be
appreciated.
