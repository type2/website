X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Having just been on the receiving end of a slapped wrist for replying to the
fuel cost FART, I appreciate the need for strict enforcement of topic, most
of us work. My mail time comes out of eating, working on the bus time &amp;
seeing the wife. Some of you may read mail _at_ work, maybe your boss doesn't
mind, but I'm sure topic related stuff &amp; not just chat help to salve your
conscience etc.

With Fridays dedicated to other BUS RELATED ramblings, to remove ones-self
from the list is 'cutting your nose off to spight your face' &amp; when it's
over a PC game, well that's got to be a joke!

I say well done to the Admin! Keep the subject VW (Having said that in a
couple of months when our baby's born, your gonna hear about it whether it's
Friday or not!)
