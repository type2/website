Subject: cross-drilled brake rotors

i am trying to come up with ideas to sligthtly improve braking without
making it a huge project.  like on the old bugs, you could put type 3 brakes
in the back, which were a bigger drum, shoes, etc.   

is there a larger, finned drum that will fit on the bus that will accomplish
the same thing?? 

second-has anyone cross-rilled their rotors, or is there a place to get
vented rotors??  or what kind of shop should i look for to get this
done(cross-drilling) to the rotors i have. i would rather it be a stock size
replacement part.  not like putting discs on a bug, where the spindles and
all need to be replaced. 

any thoughts would be helpful. 

zzz
