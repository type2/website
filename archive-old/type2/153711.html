Subject: Re: [T2] Can I switch Vacuum cans on these distributors? No, I 
  can't!

I jumped to the wrong conclusion here. One of the clips that holds the 
distributor cap onto the California distributor was occupying the position I 
needed to for one of the screws used to attach the can to the Federal 
distributor.  I thought the clip was permanently attached to the vacuum can, 
but it's not.  Underneath the clip is an already-drilled hole that lines up 
with the threaded portion of the Federal distributor.  I think I *can* 
attach the California vacuum can to the Federal distributor.

&gt;&gt;Although the cans are held in
&gt;&gt;place with two screws in both cases, the position of the screws is 
&gt;&gt;different
&gt;&gt;on the two cans
