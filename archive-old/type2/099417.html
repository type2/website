Subject: Re: [T2] the tornado, does this thing work

If such a device had benefits in fact every car off the assembly line would 
have one on it already. Don't you think that if VW could up their MPG/HP 
ratings by a measurable degree with a cheap device that they would do so?? 
I've yet to see an independent test to validate anything like the claims 
and testimonials. Save your money for stock parts.

&gt;Have any of you seen the infomercials for a product
&gt;called the tornado, its a metal piece you put in your
&gt;air filter to make the air free flow better.
&gt;Supposedly it increases your horsepower by making the
&gt;air flow better thru the intake.  Anyone know anything
&gt;about it, opinions?
