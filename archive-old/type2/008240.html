Elmer,


The engine clatter may be your hydraulic lifters pumping up. I know this
only from reading many posts about it not personal experience. As I recall
it is common. Dont know if it is a problem.

The following is based on 68 -79 and I am not sure if it relates to  80 and
up but......

Clicking in the front end could be ball joints. Are the boots torn? Jack it
up and yank on the wheels. Any play in them? Bad ball joints are just bad
and should be replaced.

I have been thru the hoops chasing down front end noises in the 69. After
the third complete and CORRECT (a la Hoover) greasing of the front beam it
is now silenced.  Do not underestimate how much grease it takes to push all
the old crap out and fill the beam with nice clean grease. Also do not waste
time shooting grease with the wheels on the ground. Get it in the air so the
the torsion bars allow the grease to flow.
