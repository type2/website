Jim,

Get a set of Sway bars from JCwitney.
For a lot less work you'll have a better handling
ride.
Stock sway bar is a 1/2 inch diameter need not
mention that its also old.
New sway bar is a 7/8 inch beast. They say that
they only stock the rear bar.
Somehow they found the front for my 79 westy. It's
great upgrade.
I am looking to add the rear sway bar soon.

Subject: [T2] Lowering a Bus


Hello Everybody:

Has anyone out there ever lowered the suspension
on a bus??  I'm not talking about slamming it on
the ground, but more like a 2 inch drop,
especially for the front end.  I do a lot of
mountain (OK, really a big hill) driving, with
lots of windy twists.  Lowering the center of
gravity would make it handle better.  I know the
best way to lower almost any suspension is to
either get lowered springs or dropped spindles,
but nobody makes dropped spindles for a late bus.
Twisting the torsion leaves would work, but would
make the ride a little harsh.  Anybody have any
suggestions??

Thanks!
