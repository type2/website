Subject: New Engine

Hello All,
Thank you to those that replied to my request last week!  Ran close to 500
miles on brand new engine, and I am Happy to report what I would call a
successful break-in.  Temps seemed to be incheck, used maybe a quart of oil,
and ran strong.  One question arises...I am getting some blow by in the
bypass.. The little rubber finger is blowing some oil.  Any suggestions?
Thanx Again,
FEBIII
