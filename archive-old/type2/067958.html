&gt; &gt;When I get 5 messages in one day inquiring about the next CCC's outing, I
&gt; &gt;guess it's time to start organizing something.  A few of you have proposed
&gt; &gt;the first weekend in January for our next meet, as this is the anniversary
&gt; &gt;of the first time we ever did this sort of thing.

Hey I think Lief and I can make that weekend!  Or at least the Friday/Saturday part 
of it.
