Subject: Starting problems--temperature sensor #2?

&gt; From: jim &lt;jiminwis_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Everything checked out okay until I got to the part
&gt; about checking the temperature sensor #2 (the one on
&gt; the head by #3 cylinder).  I find no temp sensor #2. 
&gt; Am I hallucinating? Did they put it somewhere else on
&gt; some engines? 

--&gt; It *should* be there, down by the intake manifold flange.  If you
can't find it, check the other head; I've heard of people putting the
heads on the wrong sides, and extending the sensor wire to the other side
of the engine compartment to match.
