Hello to List:

A lady I know has a late 70s van which has sat in the woods for the past
10 years.  It had a motor problem and I have salvaged most of the useful
motor and fuel injection parts.  I was planning on getting at the starter
and fuel pump sometime soon and told her I would ask the list if anyone
needed a tranny.  Now the weather is starting to get COLD and it would be
a p.i.t.a. to get out right now .... but then again she has a teen-age
boy who could do it.  The vehicle is in NW  Wisconsin near Duluth,
Minnesota.  

She also has an older van with an upright 40 and manual tranny ......
farther in the woods and unused for more like 15 years.  Have no idea
what the mechanicals on that one are like.
