&gt; Maybe 5 amps for the blower.
&gt; glow plug is more but it doesn't stay on very long.

&gt; &gt;extra defrost blower fans
&gt; You have the ambulance fans??  I don't know how much they draw, but I can't imagine it being that much.  A few amps perhaps.

dual A/C blower motors. the heat system would overheat a 45 amp master
switch I had on the heating system.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;it means wipers
&gt; &gt;it means high beams and/or driving lights.

extra lights
&gt; 
&gt; The electrical system was designed to handle those loads already.

???? doesn't seem to be working out that way, how much power does the FI
engine draw, with a pertronix in the dizzy????
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and can drain two big 950CCA batteries in about
&gt; &gt;an hour or so....over and above the alt output....
&gt; 
&gt; Then something is very wrong with your system or batteries.  Even if your two batteries were only 100 amp-hours (they are likely more) you would have to draw 100 amps above your alternator output to wear them out in an hour.

well probably more than an hour, it just seems like it...

&gt; Are you running the stock mechanical regulator?  If so, your stock alternator is probably not pulling its weight.  Have you checked how much it is actually putting out under those conditions?  I noticed a big improvement in charging when I switched to an electronic regulator.

yes maybe should  check on a different or newer regulator.. alt is in
pretty good shape
