Subject: Pics of Buses

Hey Volks..I know you've all seen my post regarding
the pics I have up for the bus I have for sale. I just
wanted you to take a look at my bus &quot;Jiboo&quot;..I have
now added Pics of it on the net too. Anyway, If you
feel like taking a look at the buses..click the links
below. I think I'm going to name the pages that I have
&quot;The Cheeze Homepages.&quot; They are so cheezy but the
purpose is to have pics online and I'm not computer
&quot;literate&quot; enough to build my own page..:-)

Any campouts being planned in the South this winter?

Peace,

Greg
