Subject: Re: oil on ground 

Once upon a time, I failed to look carefully at what
I thought I had bought and put a quart of automatic
transmission fluid in the place where engine oil ought
to go.  To use a medical analogy, it was if I had given
the patient a whopping anticoagulant -- it bled out
through every orifice.  Fresh oil cured it but not
without some more coming out.  I'm no scientist, but
I think I un-swelled every gasket/seal in the damned
thing.  Mayhaps you be similarly situated?
