Subject: Re: [T2] Removable rear aprons versus the non removable ones

&gt; Why are the rear aprons on the late bays non-removable?

good question and there are lots of suspicions but I have never seen a
difinitive answer. and having owned both 71 and 78 bays I can say I
thought the 71 was far far easier to remove. 

But

some thoughts
. maybe the heavier type IV engines needed the extra rigidity?
. maybe the VW shops were all set up to take em out via the bottom and
they wanted to discourage the home mechanics (it is a business)
. maybe they found that folks weren't putting the rears back in and
having cooling problems?  

add your own thoughts here

&gt; Was VW trying to save .02 cents on construction?

.02cents times a 1,000,000 is a lot of money!
