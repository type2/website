Subject: Injector rebuilding experence

I just had my fuel injectors rebuilt by a local (Reno)
shop and would like to pass along my experience and
have others post their injector stories.

After we got back from our x-country trip in our 79
Westy Deluxe for a total of 7500 miles, I pulled the
engine and thinking I had a dropped number three valve
seat, what was found by Ronnie of Lake Havasu (Old
Volks-Type2parts_dot_com) who is doing the rebuilding of
the head, is that the valve seat was still seated
properly but had been pounded deep in the the head. 
Since only one cylinder was so overheated, I figured
it had to be the injector as the cause since there in
no vacuum leak that is apparent.
I took the injectors to a local shop and here is what
I found out.

For $27 per injector they did a flow/spray pattern
test, cleaned completely using an ultrasonic cleaner,
rebuilt the injectors retested the flow/spray pattern,
put on new rubber hoses with the correct metal hose
piece on the injector side and supplied all new rubber
seals! They gave me a detailed written report of
before/after flow amounts. They warranty for 12/12 and
only took two days to do the work.
I did have poor spray patterns on all injectors and
all were way down on flow with one injector (cylinder
number three) being more then ten percent less flow
then the others. 

I will let the list know how the engine runs when it's
all back together.

How does this service and price compare with other
listee's experiences?
