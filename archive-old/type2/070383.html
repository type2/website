&gt;       Favorite 'attitude' sticker: &quot;Don't Mess With Texas&quot; (Anti littering...)

        Hey...I have a T-shirt with that &quot;Don't Mess with Texas&quot;
slogan on it [Yeah...I know I am in New Brunswick, Canada... It's a
long story involving roadside trash --but no orange coveralls with
numbers ;) ....I know what you were thinking]

As for VW content...how else does one get from Canada to Texas?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
