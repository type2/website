Subject: Camping World membership info

Hello Campers,

I've seen several mentions of Camping World so I'll add this.

It's a large, nationwide, chain store with regular discounts to members
which the fees run about $50 a year. They cater to RV and camping
lifestyles and generally carry everything from what grandma would want
to costly voltage inverters, high end generators, a dozen kinds of
trailer hitches and roof sealers. They also have huge service
departments for RVs.

You don't have to be a member to buy from them but if you are you get a
10% discount off the shelf price of anything you buy. That can make a
difference when buying $2k worth of solar panels like I did.

They send frequent advertisments in the mail with additional discount
coupons for as little as $5 of one item to as much as another 15% of any
total purchase.

You can order over the phone from the warehouse with a $1 shipping
special promotion has been going on since I been dealing with them.

Call them for a catalogue and they'll send you one four times a year,
not including the smaller sale catalogues I get all the time.

The are very customer friendly.
