Subject: Dual battery System isolator vs. separator

Greetings, 

I've been thinking about adding a second battery to my 77 Westfalia for
auxiliary camping purposes.  I found a pretty good deep cycle battery that
will fit on the left side of the engine compartment, but before I proceed
I'm trying to determine the best way to hook it into my charging system.

Through some research there seems to be two major options, First being the
diode isolator method.  In this approach two diodes are used to connect both
batteries to the alternator / voltage regulator system, available at any
FLAPS.  In doing this the batteries are isolated from each other and both
obtain a charge as the engine is running.  I'm not sure if I like this idea
considering that a diode is a semiconductor which will knock my charging
voltage down considerably (~ 1 volt).  Hence the batteries might never
receive a full charge and the life of the battery might be deprecated faster
than normal.  Additionally, I'm not convinced that my 55A alternator would
be very happy under these conditions.

The second option is to employ a separator,  this system is more
sophisticated in that it uses relays and a simple circuit that monitors the
charge of the batteries.  As one battery becomes charged it will switch
charging to the second battery.  Because this is a dynamically switching
system you can also manually switch both batteries so that they are working
in tandem to give yourself a jump start or for another similar purpose.
This system seems to be the way to go, at least with serious 4WD motorists,
however  at about $150 it is much more expensive and I have not seen any
recommended manufacturer installations for VWs.  I suppose the initial
expense will be retrieved in possible early battery replacement on the first
system.

I've checked out the faq which describes how to build your own system.  I'm
considering doing this but would like to run these ideas past someone who
has some experience.

I'll summarize all responses and write something for the FAQ once I'm done.

Thanks in advance,
Brian Goldin
