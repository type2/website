Subject: Hotel/Motels Re: was Towing and Road Service

Hey Mark, tell us, who is the Troll???

Anyways,  My best success with hotels and motels has
been priceline.  AAA has not even come within any
reasonable amount for a hotel I wanted.  With
priceline, one chooses the city they want, even
chooses the neighbourhood, then chooses the level of
service.  2 star is Best western/comfort inn, 3 star
is Holiday inn, 3.5 stars is Sheraton, Radisson, you
get my drift,  I have stayed at the Radisson Inner
Harbour Baltimore for $40, really nice hotel, a Best
Western w/ a full breakfast buffet in Fairfax for $20,
many times at Homestead suites in the fairfax/reston
area for $25, and the best one of all....  I am
staying for three nights overlooking Niagra Falls, a
block from the falls for $35 a night at the Sheraton
Four Points!!

In the above, AAA couldn't touch the radisson for
under $115, and $89 for the Sheraton, go figure,

I am a member of AAA, and I have been towed about four
times each year since I have been a member, a great
service (I have old cars) the triptiks and travel
books and maps (even city maps) are more than worth
the price of admission alone.

Bus content; every time I have needed the Bus towed,
they have always sent out a flatbed to avoid damaging
the steering or towing on the tranny.

&gt; Hello All    AAA also gets you the best discounts at
&gt; motels and car rentals, 
&gt; even better than AARP, which I'm not one of but the
&gt; Troll sure is!!!   Later
