Subject: Re: test your injectors!

&gt; Can you please explain to me how you benched tested your injectors??

Sure, it's pretty straightforward. I used a freshly recharged battery as a
source of power and poured gas in an old gas can, then constructed the fuel
ring, starting with the fuel pump, then the injector(s), then a T fitting
with a pressure gauge at the end and finally the fuel pressure regulator.
Excess fuel is led back to the can. Obviously, use FI fuel line and hose
clamps. Keep the battery and the electric switched at a fair distance from
the fuel because of the sparks. Take your time, play it safe, keep an
extinguisher at hand, yada yada yada... :)

For the electrical part, simply take the wire harness and plug in the
resistors bloc (taken from left side of firewall). Pick one fuel injector
connector and with a continuity checker find the 2 corresponding terminals
on the big MultiProng connector that go to the ECU. Be sure to know which
end is + and which one is -. Same with the fuel pump! (Check the wiring
diagrams for that.)

Power up the fuel pump, make sure there are no leaks, and check the
pressure. Should be about 35 psi. Then hook up a vacuum pump to the fuel
pressure regulator and pump about 15 psi of vacuum. The pressure in the fuel
ring should drop to about 28 psi (+/- 2). If you don't have the vac pump
(mine is hand-operated one with a gauge from Sears), just run the experiment
at the higher pressure. No biggy, I think.

I then powered up the connected fuel injector for a fixed amount of time (15
seconds in my case), filling a measuring cup absconded from the kitchen. My
wife wasn't very happy about that.. :).  Wait for the foam/bubbles to settle
and measure the volume. Also check the spray pattern and make sure the
injector doesn't leak once power is disconnected.  The absolute amount of
volume is not too important, you just want to use the info to match the
injectors.

Hope this helps!
