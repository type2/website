Subject: Re: [T2] On the subject of paint (sorta long)

The trouble is I don't know of any rattle=20
can primer/sealer.  Body Filler can be your friend or it can be your =
enemy

Home Depot sells one time use paint sprayer made by Pre-Val(?), you can =
find them in the paint department. This will spray the Dupont Velvaseal =
primer sealer just fine-as long as your doing a fairly small area-I =
wouldn't want to paint a whole bus with one of these sprayers. Cost is  =
about 4-5 bucks.      Jeff
