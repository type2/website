hey now,

rumba was idling kinda of rough this morning so i adjusted the idle screw, she
purred and we went on our buisiness. after several hours i went to start her
up and found she wouldn't idle. did i do something wrong? i have an 1800 engine
with a *groan* single weber carb. i'm leaving in a couple of hours and need
to haul some furniture down in rumba. if anyone reads this...help asap would
be appreciated.

thanks!
