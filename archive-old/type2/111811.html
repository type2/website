Subject: Orange Western '79 type II for sale in Vermont/New
  Hampshire/Mass area

I've a few too many tickets to pay right now before I can get my license
back, so sadly, I must part with my beloved bus.  If  you know anyone who
can give her a good home, I'm willing to drive several hours to deliver
her.  See listing here: http://www.type2_dot_com/buysell/carview.php?view=632
Thank you.
-Daniel
