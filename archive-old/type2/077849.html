Subject: Re: [T2] cops and buses in general (long winded...)

Chris,

I used to live close to a fraternity house and they solved that problem
very easily.

They *always* notified the neighbors that they were going to have a
party and put flyers with their phone number in everyone's mail box.

The stated that if they were too loud to *please* call them and they would
handle it.  They told when the party would start and when it would
end...generally by 11pm.

I called them once in about 3 years and the effect was immediate.

&quot;Good&quot; neighbors are worth it...ya gotta live with them and it pays to
know who they are....

Now I live in the country and I call my neighbors to wish them a Merry
Christmas....they take care of me, and I take care of them.....even if
they are &quot;old curmedgeons&quot;.....and they love my Vw's!!...and this is
Arkansas....If you don't have at least 3-4 dead cars on your property, you
ain't from around here&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I live on Yerba Buena Island, which is an old Navy base in the middle of the

&gt; wanted to file a complaint, but there is a station here on the island, and I
&gt; am worried if I go to file a complaint about it, I will just get harrased
&gt; even more. Needless to say, we aren't having any more parties at our place,
&gt; but sometimes I just don't know when to fold, when to walk away, or when to
&gt; run. =)
