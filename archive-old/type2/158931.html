Subject: Does AFM mix screw ONLY affect idle?

A question for the august technical wizards on the list:
In NJ they test emissions only at idle, and being over 3.0 CO,
I opend up the AFM mix screw and got 1.6 CO.  However, I thought this 
adjustment ONLY affects idle, so I left it alone.  I mention this 
because Don (durocshark_at_gmail_dot_com) said on his page after doing the same 
thing, he turned the AFM back.  Now of interest is that in his smogging 
they test at running rpms, and his went even lower, from 1.1 to 0.34.
So is the AFM adj additive to running rpms (leaning it out possibly too 
much) or does it only affect idle, as I assumed, since the idle air is 
actually a bypass to the throttle?
