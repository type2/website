Okay here's my .02! Hope someone will correct me when I get away from the 
truth.

Fuel injection just isn't as user friendly as carbs can be. The reality is 
most people don't want to understand/learn fuel injection and so they 
pronounce it unreliable and too complicated. The OEM L-Jet fuel injection 
isn't really that hard though.

I have worked on several former fuel injected cars/busses that folks had 
installed center mounted conversion kits on. They seldom work right out of 
the box. If you tuned and tuned (jet and emulsion tube swaps and venturis, 
etc.) then they might work better but once the outside temps dropped they 
began having troubles again from carb icing. This can be overcome with an 
air cleaner with a preheat snorkel but I have never seen anyone take the 
time to get it to work although it wouldn't be difficult. Gas mileage has 
been rather poor on the cars I have worked on and probably due to the lack 
of tuning on the part of the owner. Also many of them had stumbling or 
popping problems.

Dual carbs (I have dual 36mm Dells on my Type IV powered Beetle) work much 
better than center mount carbs but they still have trouble with the cold 
weather until they warm up from engine heat. They also require alot of 
tuning initially. Some folks will buy the largest carbs they can afford and 
then never realize that the engine would run better with smaller carbs. I 
derived my carb size from Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook. He 
explains carbs well and has a formula for deciding how much carb you really 
need. I have managed mid-20's on a stock 2.0 Type IV with dual quiet packs 
in a '65 Beetle. Once the car is back on the road I think I can do better 
with a bit more tuning. Mine used K&amp;N filters on each carb but made alot of 
noise (but then the car had almost no sound insulation.). I'd like to adapt 
a Porsche air cleaner I saw once that connects the two carbs to a single 
oil bath filter and work out a pre-heat hose for cold days. By the way 
folks will claim more power from carbs than OEM fuel injection. Probably 
folks who never really understand these things get more power right out the 
box with big dual carbs - but I think a modern fuel injected engine (2.0 
Type IV VW with more modern fuel injection) can make more useful power and 
mpg than dual or center mount carbs. Prob runs much better too.

The OEM VW fuel injection like found on the busses works pretty well. Mine 
required all new injector seals and vacuum hoses ($20 or so). I was able to 
trade an old center mount carb conversion kit to a fellow who really wanted 
it - even after I warned him. From him I landed another complete '78 VW 
injection system for spares. My VW will start in any temp and idle like a 
happy cat purrs. I've made no changes whatsoever just maintenance. I think 
dual carbs will make more power because they will tolerate wilder cams and 
other modifications than L-Jetronic. The old L-Let however can be 
troubleshot with simple tools - fuel pressure gauge, multimeter, etc. I saw 
low 20's mpg in my '78 bus on the interstate at 60-65 mph.

The OEM L-Jetronic isn't very performance oriented and I've read several 
accounts of K-Jetronic being used (that's the CIS system) with very good 
results. This is something I want to try myself. The result was better fuel 
economy and better power too. These are capable I think of using a 
catalytic convertor since they have an O2 sensor and can maintain the 
careful stoiciometric (can't spell that one!) ratios necessary.

That's all I know - or think I know.

Anyone else able to elaborate or correct me?

Take care!

&gt;HI!

&gt;I've got a question I've been fighting with...and couldn't find enough
&gt;information on the web to make a desicion.
&gt;
&gt;Which is better?  A carborated engine or one with Fuel Injection?
&gt;
&gt;I've seen plenty of rebuild kits that are Carborated...but no FI's.  Is this
&gt;due to cost? Or are Carborated engins that much better?(performance or ease
&gt;of repair?)
&gt;
&gt;I have a running '79 Stock FI engine and I'm trying to decide what to do
&gt;when I rebuild the engine, I would like something larger (it's a 1800) but
&gt;can only find them Carborated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your info!
