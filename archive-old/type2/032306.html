hi all..

i have a little perdicament im stuck in right now.
Lately, I haven't had the time to work on my bus. Since it was lacking any
braking ability whatsoever, I decided to have it towed to the local vw guy
and have him do the brakes. I have been working on this bus for about a
year now off and on, bought it last summer without an engine. Its a '74. I
installed the 1.8 FI '75 engine from my old bus (RIP). 

anywho..... I had it towed over this morning. He called be at aobut 3:30
and told me what he was doing and what needed to be done:

new front rotors (new)
new calipers     (new)
rear drums       (used)
rear back plates (used)
and about 5 hours of labour at $35 / hour

total in the ballpark of $600
that was somewhat expected....

but...
he also told me that the engine was only running on 2 cyls (1 &amp; 2)...
is that possible?... i was driving it around the block yesterday!

total disbelief.... fear... then stomach pain.

he said it was a problem related to the Fuel injection, which he said I
would have been  better off with dual weber 34ICTs, (which i already have
on my type 3 engine in my basement, collecting dust. they will gladly come 
off if need be). he said it could also be a vaccum leak.

Im really, really worried. What if it isn't just a vaccum leak?
there is a 'sucking' air sound coming from the engine compartment AND
when you rev the engine the brake pedal goes down by itself with the speed
of the engine. Im really hoping this is a simple  problem. Or else
this bus is gonna have to sit for a while and i really don't want that. 
i know the engine ran good when it was in my old bus. Nothing went really
wrong during  the transplant. maybe i hooked the vaccum lines up wrong(?)

I dont' really know what im asking or saying here. I'm just worried....
I have had bad luck with my previous buses and I don't want this one to
die before she's even born (and throwing away $600 for new brakes). I
need her in driving condition. I dont' have the time or money to fix major
problems. I trust my VW guy with my heart/bus. I hope he can make all
well soon. 

Thanks for listening... I feel a little better having typed all this :'(

worried,
Eddie Goodwin
