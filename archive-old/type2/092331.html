Subject: Re: [T2] stange timing reading, need help!

As always, H Steve has the good information!

I just thought I'd  add,,,
as Ben was originally asking about -quote----
&gt;DWELL is 34deg at the most (It should be 44deg to 50deg!!!!!)
&gt;Gap of breaker point is .40mm  (It should be between .40mm/.50mm by
&gt;Bentley, mine's OK) 

put the emphasis on using the DWELL METER,, not feeler gauges.  If you have a
dwell meter, ignore the feeler gauge settings
The electrical spark could care less about the mechanical distance the points
are open, but it makes a huge difference having the correct electrical time, or
degrees that the points are closed.
The dwell meter shows the actual electrical time in degrees 

using a 16 thou. {.40mm/.50mm} initial setting, or when stranded will make the
engine run
Using a dwell meter will give you accurate results.

Old Eskimo trick...
When stranded,, and have to change points in your snowmobile,, you will find
that a paper match book cover is about .016&quot; thick and makes an excellent point
gap gauge ,,, to get you running till you find a dwell meter and strobe light.
Your fingers won't stick to a match book as they do to that cold metal feeler
gauge.

Hmmm,, the Bentley manual cover is the same thickness!  8-)  For those
non-smokers.

&gt; Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; What you have found is not unexpected.  Because changing the dwell
&gt; angle changes not only the amount of time that the points are open/closed,
&gt; but also where in the rotation the points do open and close, resetting the
&gt; dwell will have a large effect on timing.   I would advise you to reset
&gt; the dwell as close as your patience will allow to 50 degrees, then check
&gt; the timing again.  You *must* set dwell before setting timing.  To do
&gt; otherwise produces meaningless and confusing results, as you have found.
