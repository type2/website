&gt; It has come up in the last few days about engine swaps for the Bus(it does
&gt; several times a year). I went to the Kennedy Engineered Products page and
&gt; they offer an adapter for just about anything. The one I like is the
&gt; Mitsubishi 3.0l V6. This engine is the standard engine in all of the
&gt; Dodge/Plymouth mini vans, the Mitsi Montero, their trucks, and several
&gt; Chrystler midsized cars. The size and wheight of a Dodge mini-van is close
&gt; to that of a Bus and these things litter junkyards all over the U.S. They
&gt; were fuel injected, but someone may have an intake manifold that would alow
&gt; a carburator. They started using them around 86-88 and are still in
&gt; production. I have one in my 98 Dodge Caravan. Power is exelent, engine is
&gt; small, parts are very plentiful. A local yard (U-pull) sells them for $150.
&gt; Of course there is still the problem of a radiator, but unless you use a VW,
&gt; Corvar, or Porche you will have the same problem. I like the fact that it is
&gt; compact. I am hoping to put one in my 84 D-50 pickup soon, if it goes well I
&gt; will asess the work involved in putting it into a Bus.
&gt; So, just one more option.

One correction:

I think that the Dodge minivan weighs at least 1000 pounds more than a VW
bus.  The VW would perform very well with that engine if the transmission
held together and had the correct ratios!

I wonder what the fit would be like?  I'd prefer that the conversion be
able to revert to VW original so that I can sell the bus and use the
proceeds to put my kids through college.
