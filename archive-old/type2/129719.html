Subject: Re: [T2] Rotor Button? Distributor Cap?

Hmm, I think there's a law that states: no tool box should exceed the 
size of the vehicle the tools stored therein are kept for working on. 
Except that the law doesn't end with a preposition.

A bus might be bigger than this tool box, but not by much.
