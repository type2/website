Subject: Re: [T2] Re: rusted battery boxes

Hello Tom,

Please don't cut them out and leave the holes open. I
thought about doing the very same thing but I was
quickly corrected. This would have the same effect as
driving your bus without the seal around the engine
tin. The hot air that you fan pushes under the engine
would be pulled back into the engine compartment. This
would cause your engine to blow hot air on the engine
drecreasing your engine cooling capabilities and your
engine life. If you have to cut them out, use somthing
to cover up the hole like screwing in sheet metal or
welding new battery trays in. Your engine will thank
your for it. Have a great day!!

&gt; Both of my battery boxes are in brutal shape. I just

&gt; Something occured to me, to put up for comment.
&gt; Since I don't need the
&gt; battery boxes anymore, and they need replacement,
&gt; what would be the effect
&gt; of cutting them out and leaving them open?  Sure
&gt; would provide lots of
&gt; cooling air, wouldn't it? Would this affect the body
&gt; rigidity, and/or would
&gt; it be a good or bad idea? I don't drive in the
&gt; winter, so salt wouldn't be
&gt; splashing up inside.
