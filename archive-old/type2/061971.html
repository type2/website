&gt;     I went to some body shops to see how much it would cost to get the 65's body
&gt; work and paint done. I told the people that I wanted a showroom quality shine,
&gt; something I can take to shows and bring home trophys with. I went to three
&gt; places, one said it'd take 5-6 weeks and cost between 5 and 6000 bucks. Another
&gt; said a month and a half and cost 6000. The third said she'd be off the road for
&gt; 12 - 14 MONTHS and cost 12,000 dollars!  Yes the comma IS in the right place.
&gt; Umm, any thoughts on this? I am definately willing to spend 6 - 8,000 to get
&gt; this done, but 12,000? I don't think so Tim.
&gt;     Also, anyone have contacts with people who do repairs on pop-tops? Actually
&gt; repair isn't the word, more like rebuild from scratch. The canvas is so old if
&gt; you put light pressure on it your finger goes straight through. Any help is
&gt; greatly appreciated.

What condition is the body in? Is there rust? I'd suggest that you give the body repair 
a twirl yourself.

I just bought a welder and tools for around $500.00 to restore my '65 crew cab that has 
major rust damage throughout. I can prolly get the car looking good enough to take it to 
a body shop and get a really good paint job that shouldn't cost over $1000.00.
