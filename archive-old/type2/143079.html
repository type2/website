Subject: More tire FART - With a twist!

I was just reading about rim widths and came across something I hadn't heard
before:

&quot;Selection of a wider rim, from within the approved range, (T &amp; RA tables)
stiffens the sidewall and improves handling at the expense of handling.&quot;

(From http://www.dunloptire_dot_com/care/widthRatio.html )

And from a Yokohama site ( http://www.yokohamatire_dot_com/utrimwidth.asp ):

&quot; A wider wheel will improve handling at the expense of ride quality, while
a narrower wheel will improve ride quality at the expense of handling.&quot;

So the question is: A 6.5&quot; wide rim will actually STRENGTHEN the tire? Or
just make the tire fail more dramatically, all at once instead of gradually?
