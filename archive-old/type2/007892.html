&gt; Anyone have experience about the time I can expect the hose to last
before it

Using the VW stock hose, I've found that it starts to get noticably
stiffer after two to three years in service (this with what passes for
gasoline here in SoCal, which is probably a worst-case situation)

My rule of thumb is to replace it every three years or whenever the
line is opened for another reason.  Fuel line is cheap, fires aren't!
