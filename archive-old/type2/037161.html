Subject: steering...again

A couple weeks ago I posted a problem with my steering, it looked like the 
problem was the coupler disc, however, as it turns out the problem was 
actually the housing for the steering lever idler assembly, on the lower axle 
tube. I welded it and reinforced it the best that I could for a temporary 
fix. I only have one question for the list....am I going to have to replace 
the lower axle tube? I cannot seem to find any sort of replacement housing 
for the idler pin, and the one that is there is not repairable. 
Thanks for the ears........
