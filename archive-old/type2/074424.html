Subject: Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

It's official, I'm dangerous. I'm still reading the &quot;Aircooled Engines&quot; 
book and really loving it.

Naturally it's raising some questions. I want get a bit of your expertise.

I was reading about combustion chambers and the author was saying that 
polished surfaces reflect heat (I knew that) and that keeping heat from 
soaking into the heads (combustion chamber) is a good thing, I think he was 
saying it would make more HP this way.

So... is he saying that a polished combustion chamber and exhaust port 
would be advantageous and make more HP? Would a coating on the piston help 
this effect?

So how polished is good and how much is too much? If you could achieve a 
polished effect like found on wheels would that be the best you could 
theoretically hope for? Would it last more than 10 seconds after the first 
time you started the engine (carbon and basic soot would ruin any polished 
effect right?)?

Finally I know there are different kinds of ceramic coatings that can be 
applied that would do about the same thing. Has anyone tried this, what 
sort of cost, durability? Does it ruin the engine's ability to heat the 
interior of passenger compartment? How good is the horsepower increase? 10 HP?

I suppose that coating the combustion chamber and the pipes inside and out 
would be good right? Does it help the engine's fuel efficiency?

Just doing more armchair engineering...  Cheaper that way.

Love those Tatra engines - amazing engineering!
