Hi.  I'm new to this list and I'd like to thank all of you for the wealth of 
knowledge I've found here.  I've spent several days researching the archives 
and I'm about to purchase my first type2.  It will need to ferry my kids (3, 
2, and in utero) to and from school and other activities.  So naturally I 
want to make sure they'll be safe.

I have a found a beautiful '71 bus in my area (Toronto) that's in great 
shape all over.  Before I buy it, I was hoping a list member might be able 
to advise me on the complexities of adding bench seats with headrests and 
3-point retractable seatbelts all around.

In reading the list archives, it seems to me that pre-1973 type2s have no 
fittings for 3 point seat belts.  Can anyone tell me that I'm wrong?  I'd be 
very relieved to hear that installing 3 point belts would be just as easy in 
a '71 as it is in a '75.

I have found numerous posts about replacing the front driver and passenger 
seats on '68-'71 bus with seats out of a '73-'75 bus.  Does anyone have any 
experience with replacing one or both of the rear benches?  I've seen 
benches with headrests in a '78 bus.  Anyone know if they'll fit in a '71?

Thanks again for this great resource.

If anyone's interested, the bus I've found is listed here:
