i hope this reaches all that have responded to me about an article about
rebuilding your 34.3 to eliminate all flat spots.  i realize there is a lot of
humble opinions out there on what dizzy to use....i personally believe in
both....they each have their redeeming qualities.  the tech article that
worked for me was out of a march 1993 hot vws magazine.  i have a copy i could
fax someone if you dont have success in locating your own..........ciao`
