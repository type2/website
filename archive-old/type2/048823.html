Subject: [T2] More Merc Wheel Info

More info from the Mercedes list on wheels for our busses:

The 126 up through 1985 came with 14&quot; wheels.

Numbers for  the 126 from '86 through end of production are:

300 SE, 420 SE/SEL, 560 SEL, 300 SDL, 350 SDL.

The earlier models are the 300 SD, 380 SE/SEL, and 500 SEL.

A big thank you to the Mercedes list!
