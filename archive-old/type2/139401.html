Subject: Re: [T2] Road Trip

Mass is small, but Cali is a huge target. It would help if you'd narrow 
it down a little.

Assuming you're headed for Southern Cal, you probably want to take the 
40 across the Texas panhandle, NM, AZ, and meet up with the 15 in 
Barstow, CA. The grades are much gentler than on the 70. (The 70 from 
Denver to Dylan is serious climbing). The 40 is tricky though; the 
grades sneak up on you. Not a bad idea to install one of those 
inclinometers and regulate your speed accordingly.

Fifteen days one way? Or round trip? I did this drive in exactly 72 
hours, start to finish, from noon 9/11/2001 to noon 9/14/2001, but that 
was in some compact Avis rental car. It can be done more reasonably in 
five days one way, but six is more reasonable. That's six days without 
incident, about 500 miles a day.

Mark &quot;I finally found the cruise control switch by the time I got to 
Victorville&quot; Hineline

&gt; Im sure many of you have done some cross-country trips in your busses. 
&gt;  Any
&gt; route suggestions (Mass to Cali)?  And how long did your trip take?  
&gt; Is 15
&gt; days too little time?  THANKS!
