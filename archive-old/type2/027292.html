Wade, where are you located??

I have a '72 in my garage that I was going to try to get on the road.  Is 
was sitting out side for about 7 years, but was put away running.  And it 
was put on a concrete slab by the PO.  Very thoughtful.

It was advertised as a '70, but obviously not so.  It looked fairly decent 
by the side of the road, with a lot of surface paint eaten away.  I thought 
I could redo the rough spots, and get a coat of paint on it, and it would be 
presentable.

Well, I just got the cast off my foot this afternoon, after 10 weeks in the 
cast.  I finally can start (continue) to do something about the 72

Except for the surface rust, and a few particular spots, the body is sound.  
Much more so than my daily driver '78.  But as I go into it, and clean 
things up, it is looking more and more like a gem that was covered by a dark 
cloud!!  The top plywood is 'show quality'.  The rear seats are great (even 
have a matching cover for the spare tire in the back!!!) But the steering 
wheel is cracking up - brittle.

I got to the rear brakes, and the shoes are like new.  The PO included a new 
master brace cylinder.

Well, I have not had a chance to pop the top yet.  I am really curious about 
the pop top canvas.

But as well as I can see, the top cot is all there and the canvas probably 
is fine, too.

If I decide to get rid of the '72 (mother in law coming next month, and a 
'75 camper with less surface rust could be coming available in a few weeks. 
), I might need to quickly sell or part out the '72.  If you are in the 
northern Virginia or southern maryland, I will keep you in mind.

Let me know where you are and what you need .
