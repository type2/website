&lt;&lt; Any opinions as to what the best model year would be for an air cooled
 Westy?  &gt;&gt;

Lots!!  They tend to be VERY personal, here's mine.

Best aircooled Westy's have the tougher type 4 engine and the full upper bed 
that sleeps 2 instead of the rather unfortable, single canvas cot.  This puts 
you at 1974 or later.

For best reliability and drivability fuel injection is tops. This puts you at 
1975 and later.

In 1975 or 1976 the floor plan changed and some feel it uses space more 
efficiently.  The front passenger seat also swivels around to face the rear 
on these.

The 1980 vanagon provides even more interior space, bigger rear hatch, better 
table arrangement etc.  The biggest trade-off is that they are bit heavier 
than the bus but are still powered by the same engine.

You can't go wrong with any of them!  I had a 74 that I was converting to 
fuel injection when I found a nice 79.  I made the upgrade because it was in 
such nice shape and it had the later cabinet/floor plan that I liked.

(If I make the leap to a vanagon westy it will probably be to a watercooled 
one with a dead engine, just waiting to be converted to TDI diesel power.)
