&gt;The Dormobile was VW-approved and mine was originally sold

Snip!

I have never been clear on whether or not Dorm's _were_ &quot;approved&quot; by VW officially or not? I know 
that there were a number of them converted and that you could get Dorm roof's thru the dealer, I 
wonder if that makes them officailly &quot;condoned&quot; by VW? I was under the impression that the only 
&quot;official&quot; conversion company recogniized by VW was Westfalia. 

Regardless the Dorm roof is a brilliant conversion and the roof does give a lot of headroom, the 
biggest laibiltity I can see about the roof is the potential lack of ventilation up there.
