Marvin -

My E-brake holds Itch at a stop on the hill I live on, which itself is quite
an incline. I also have a few more &quot;clicks&quot; left on the E-brake handle, so I
think it should take a couple more degrees incline, if need be.

Have you run out of &quot;clicks&quot; on the handle? I have about 20-21 ratchet marks
showing on the top of my E-brake handle when pulled out taut.

&gt; And I'm pulling the brake
&gt; pretty hard. So is this just a design flaw, or do I need to do some brake
&gt; work?
