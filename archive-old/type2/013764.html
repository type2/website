I hate to admit this but I'm hoarding  up 3 of the  80-83 Aircooled 4
Speed Manual Transmissions.
I'm going to keep only one for use in my own 83 Westfalia and sell off
the other two.
Here's the question: Two of the trannys work and shift smoothly but they
feel tight, the third feels like its realy slick in that it shifts very
smoothly, much smoother than the other two.
Transmission #1, 83 Vanagon Box, works and shifts smoothly but it feels
tight, I've put about 40K on this tranny and it hasn't given me any
problems.
Transmission #2, 81 Vanagon Box, shifts very smoothly, much smoother than
the other two, just ran this tranny about 600 miles to test it, I like
the smooter shifting but think it might be wear (loose).
Transmission #3, 81 Vanagon Box, works and shifts smoothly but it feels
tight. Kinda noisy in reverse.
I can't feel much appreciable difference in the pinion slack. I'm
currently running this tranny and it works just fine.
If you gotta have the case side numbers it'll have to wait until
tomorrow.

Is it just a crap shoot trying to pick the best box?
