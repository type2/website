Once upon a time Sears [and some FLAPS] used to sell an inflation kit that
worked by removing a convenient spark plug and running the engine.  Had an
air pressure gauge on the end, etc., pretty much like a typical gas station
setup.  I haven't seen one for over 20 years, but someone like J. C. Whitney
might still have them.  Given the typical spark plug R&amp;R hassle on a Type 4
engine that's not a very attractive option...

We've carried a little Coleman 12V air pump in our bus for many years and
find it adequate for some pretty large tires.  Similar units are sold
locally [on sale] for as little as $10.00.  A lot simpler and cheaper than
cobbling up a belt-driven pump in the engine room.
