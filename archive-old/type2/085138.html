Subject: FW: Bleeding brakes!

Hello

&gt; I was wondering if anyone can help me.  I have a 73 westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; I have renewed all the brake lines and flexi hoses.  I have bleed the
&gt; system but can not get any pedal.  If I pump the pedal I get some presure
&gt; but then lose it again.  This makes me think it is probably the master
&gt; cylinder but there was no problem with this before I drained the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas what else it could be? or is everything as I
&gt; thought pointing to the master cylinder?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers 
&gt; Matt
&gt;
