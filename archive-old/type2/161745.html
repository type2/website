Subject: RE: [T2] FW: Jiffy Lubes caught on NBC camera

&gt; http://mfile.akamai_dot_com/12924/wmv/vod.ibsys_dot_com/2006/0503/9152183.200k.asx&gt;
&gt; For those not allowed to view vid's from work, or have some ports&gt; blocked,
or alarms get thrown, etc, could you give a quick summary of&gt; what it is I'm
not allowed to see?&gt;

It's about Jiffy Lube ripping people off and a local news station catching
them. Not too heavy in the bus content, I guess it's implied we don't have to
worry about paying for jobs that don't get done because we do them
ourselves???
