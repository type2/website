Subject: turn signal signals

Hi all - while we were discussing relays, lights and what not, I have a
question about my dashboard turn  indicator lights. They don't. USUALLY
this means one of my turnsignal BULBS is out, but all four work fine. And I
replaced both bulbs in the dash, checked all the wires, etc. I can hear the
relay clicking; usually the dashlights will light once or twice even if a
turn bulb is out, but not now.
I am also curious - if both indicator lights on a 70 flash in unison,
regardless of whether left or right is selected, are there years where the
dash indicators correspond ONLY to the direction you plan to go?
