Subject: Re: [T2] Potential Trailer Hitch Info

It's easy to describe - you can't see any of it except the tongue for the=20
hitch ball.

The rest is inside the bumper. The brackets are designed to put the cross=20
tube inside the bumper - it does not bolt to the bumper and it does not=20
touch the bumper. It only shares the bumper attachment bolts.

Anyone in Charlotte that can check on these guys (that made the hitch)?




&gt;That sounds like just the hitch I would like to get. Does anyone know if it
&gt;is available or who sells a comparable one. I really like the idea of just
&gt;bolting it in place. Also I would be interested in seeing some pics of a
&gt;hitch installed.
&gt;Later,
