Subject: Seatbelts 1978 Bus

Jerry &amp; Denise:
We are new proud owner of a 1978 Bus.


Denise:
Becuase I am 4'11&quot; tall it is necessry for me to pull the driver's seat
pretty far up. Because of that I'm having a problem making the shoulder
strap seatbelt fit for me.

My husband and I are willing to peruse junk yards to find something that
works. Hopefully you can offer suggestions to help solve this problem.

Thanks!
Denise  (aka pinecone)

Jerry:
I will post a list of sugestions that are sent to us.

Thank You
