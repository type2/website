I'm trying to visualize up hill in both directions???? told my kids that
when I was growing up I had to walk to and from school everyday and it was
uphill in both directions.....;8*}   (don't think they bought it)

&gt; And I just wanna say I got it running and drove it where it gonna sit for a
&gt; long time. :)

true but when moving don't you think you have a few more things to worry
about???/
&gt;
&gt; But yes, that is last resort.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;for that short a distance a come along or block and tackle might be
&gt; &gt;sufficient, one direction should be downhill I would guess

get it over with
