&lt;&lt; I've gone back to using straight WD-30 for my Type I engine after 
previously
using Mobil 1 15-50.  I changed after thinking about the engineering of the 
engine, particularly the pressure relief valve, which causes thick oil to 
bypass the oil cooler.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; I am curious to see if anyone else has come to this conclusion or has 
logicked this to a different conclusion. &gt;&gt;

I guess we are more interested in whether or not you saw an actual 
temperature drop than in conjecture!  Tell us, are your temps lower now?!!
