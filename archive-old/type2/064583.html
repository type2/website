So Joel Walker says:
&gt; &gt;really, FI people aren't dorks, I'd be one misself if I could.  Except for
&gt; &gt;Steve Johnson, now he's a dork!  Hi Steve!  Did your bus make it home?  :-P
&gt; 
&gt; hey!! don't poke fun at Steve!! he's the only one what brung REAL food!!! :)

Ha!  That was just my crafty way of off-setting David's mileage. By plying
Joel with a big rib-eye steak, I figure I knocked at least 2 mpg off of
what mileage they could've made.  ;)  ;p  ;)
 
&gt; 
&gt; Unca Joel (the big fat one in the passenger's seat).
