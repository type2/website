&gt; I'm not sure how much these go for because my Uncle
&gt; gave this one to me when
&gt; he didn't want it.  I was wondering if you guys
&gt; could tell me how much they go
&gt; for normally

Generally, about $50 bucks. Let me know who to write
the check out to, and I'll get it out of your way to
save you the hassle of finding a buyer ;^)
