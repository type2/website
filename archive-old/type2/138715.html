I bought this Bus in early 2001 and have been using it as a daily driver 
since then.  The engine was replaced in early 2002, and the heads were 
replaced in mid-2004 due to a bad seal at the exhaust which burned a valve.  
I have driven this Bus from Colorado to Nevada to Massachusetts to North 
Carolina, and have never had any problems other than the ones listed above.  
It runs strongly on the highway, maintaining 65-70mph for hours on all but 
the steepest hills.  The shocks and tires help the cornering, and the 
steering has little play.  The brakes work well, although the rears 
currently need adjustment.

It breaks my heart to sell this Bus after putting so much work into it, but 
it has required more and more maintenance since the recent engine rebuild, 
and I need more reliable transportation.  I feel it is worth $4,000, but it 
is currently not running, so I'm asking $2,500 or trade for a non-rusty, 
running Bus.
