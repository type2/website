To All...

This is a rather convoluted tale, but I'll strive to be brief.  The payoff
MAY be worth the trouble...

Last Monday I followed a link from a CNN Online story about Libya and the
Lockerbie case.  On the Libyan page was an ad for a German firm specializing
in supplying German vehicles and spares to various Middle Eastern countries.

I reached the company's Home page via a link in their Libyan ad.  Here's the
URL for the German firm:    http://www.arpogaus_dot_de/

You might want to check out their website [there's an English language
version] so you know what they advertise/offer/claim.

On a whim I e-mailed them asking if they could supply air-cooled VW spare
parts.  Following are my message to them, clearly indicating I was inquiring
from the USA, and their surprisingly prompt response:

I have not written back to them yet, but will probably send a short wish
list over the weekend just to see what they can provide, and to get some
trial price quotes.

It may not pan out after all, but nothing ventured, etc., etc.....
