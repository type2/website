I purchased a VW engine this weekend and was wondering if anyone on this list could identify it for me... the only number I could find on the engine is: 467992.
Any ideas?
I also purchased two others, and could only read part of the numbers on them, they both started with: 211.
Any ideas on these.. I think they are 1600's, but not sure.
