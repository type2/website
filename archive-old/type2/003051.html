&gt; Hey, where in Kansas are you located?  We have a really active bus =
group and
&gt; would enjoy a new person at the campouts.  There are still 4 campouts =
left
&gt; before the snow begins!!

Hey now Rick,

Buddy and I are located in Lawrence, KS......right down the road from =
KU.
I got my fine arts degree in painting from KU last May and I'm still =
here.....
Looking to move sometime soon.  Someplace rural would be =
nice...especially somewhere I can work on my bus without getting honked =
at every five minutes (my house and driveway face a two way street =
buzzing with college students).

We have sort of an old type2 clan here but we never gather too =
much...I'd LOVE to come to one of your gatherings!
Perhaps I'll drag a few of my bus buddies with me....could you email me =
with more details Rick? :o)

I'd adore to hang around other busers because I usually bug our local VW =
shop owner...Das Autohaus is the place.....I asked him if I could just =
hang out and learn from them, the owner looked at me like I was crazy.  =
I heard it was because 'girls just aren't meant to be mechanics'.
Well I beg to differ as I can't think of a better smell than grease and =
that smell of the inside of my bus and inside the engine hatch when I =
pop it open. :o)
Always gotta take a whiff....just LOVE getting my hands dirty and =
solving problems on her the 'right' way.  Restoring Buddy has been a =
very positive task in my life and also a very sort of 'personal' =
one....I've BONDED with this bus Volks!

Kansas Bus Drivers Unite! hehe
Smiles and Waves,
Shannon &amp; &quot;Buddy&quot; ('74 Transporter Bus)
