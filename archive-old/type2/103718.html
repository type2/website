&gt; &gt; I just installed this kit in my 78 about two months ago. Its a pretty
good
&gt; &gt; match to the original vinyl but its a little lighter in color. The
weight is
&gt; &gt; a bit thicker so getting the panels back into the rails was tight in
some
&gt; &gt; places. When they ship it they fold it into a smaller box so make sure
to
&gt; &gt; use some heat on the folds or you will see the wrinkles after its glued.
&gt; &gt; Hopefully the summer heat will take the wrinkles out of mine. It comes
with
&gt; &gt; all the pieces that are visible without the upper bunk folded down. It
looks
&gt; &gt; great once all installed. I would also suggest using the heavy duty 3M
spray
      adhesive. It holds a lot better.


&gt; Did you use any heat at installation time?

No heat durring install. Don't want to stretch the vinyl then have it shrink
once glued down and come loose.


&gt; There are two pieces under each upper bunk cushion that I don't expect to
&gt; get in the kit.What 5 pieces are included then? I can only count 4 (cab,
rear, 2 sides).


I dont know how they are counting 5 pieces. I actually count 6. The sides
have 4 pieces. If you look you can see where the two panels connect about
half way back. The rear side pieces flair at the back so the vinyl is a
little wider for the rear. The front over the seats and the bottom of the
top bunk bed board. 6 total.
