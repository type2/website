&gt; Has anyone ever paid this (or more) for one?

It really depends on the persons ability and time
available to
build a decent running vehicle.  I mean that the
drop dead vehicle
value, [as an indicator of safety and reliability]
should be around
$5 to $6000. I wouldn't want to drive on a long
trip to anywhere in
a car that's worth $2000 or $3000. Consider it a
measurement of risk.

If you have the ability to decrease that risk on
your own via a
garage, tools and time the market set's the price.
I've never had a
car that has invited so many wonderful people to
come over and just
say hi.  Hey list, even little kids, they smile
and wave, I don't get it.
How can they know?

Just this week I saw a '79 (?) Westy for sale here
on the list for an asking
price of $8,000.00. Has anyone actually ever sold
a bay Westy for this much?
Has anyone ever paid this (or more) for one. I see
a lot advertised for 6,
7,8 thousand and more, but always wonder if
anyone has actually bought/sold
one for this much. Just curious.    Jeff S.
