Subject: Camping in PA - 10/16-18 - BBTT

Volks,

I know it is a bit late, but this apparently got to the vanagon list, but
not to ours.  There is a campout this coming weekend, hight &quot;Buses By The
Trail&quot; in Lenhartsville, PA, near Allentown.  Information on this campout
can be found at:

The reason for posting this is that I am thinking seriously of going.
John Anderson had talked me into caravanning with him, but had to cancel
when he actually did *well* on his MCATS :-) I would still like to go, but
the condition of my motor is such that I wiould still prefer to caravan up
into the mountains.  If anyone is planning on going from Baltimore,
Washington, or from south of Washington... let me know if you would be
interested in caravanning!!!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
