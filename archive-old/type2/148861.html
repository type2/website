Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

&lt;Perhaps its time for you to install a &quot;stinger&quot;
muffler on your T2?  Oh, I guess that would not work
out.  Stinger mufflers are not street legal.  But it
doesn't stop me from dreaming-up devious bus noise
making techniques.   And of course, you would need to
turn your stinger-equipped bus ignition off at 9:59:59
PM.&gt;

hmmm, one of those big beach slingshots and cherry bomb firecrackers.... Launch 'em at their front door... 

&lt;JUST KIDDING!&gt;

Maybe you need to host a &quot;Tech Day&quot; for 29 of your favorite VW friends... &lt;grin!&gt; 

We do that in the local Corvair club I belong to. A dozen of us and various elderly cars will show up for a morning of wrenching. Do yours in the evening and like Cliff said, end it at 9:59:59... &lt;grin!&gt; 

Remember ANYTHING can set off a neighbor... I heard about a lawsuit where two girls got sued for leaving freshbaked cookies on their neighbors doorstep as a gift!!! And won...

Could this be because of the graying of our population (more picky old folks as the baby-boomers get old and grumpy)?
