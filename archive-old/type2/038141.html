Subject: Valve Cover Gaskets

I need to change my valve cover gaskets and was wondering, can I do this
without taking the engine out?  ('72 Transporter)  It's got the stock
1700 type IV engine in it, please tell me I can do it without taking the
engine out, I've done it once, and it's not a fun job.  Actually that's
why it's leaking oil.  I took the engine out, and after I put it back in,
it's now leaking a bit of oil.  It never did before I took the engine
out, and I didn't do anything to the engine, I just took the fuel tank
out and changed it!  Ugh.  It does look like the oil is coming out of the
passenger side valve cover, so I'm going to put new gaskets on them.
