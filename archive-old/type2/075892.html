Subject: Re: [VB] Vehicle registration in Calif



You should also touch bases prior to all that to see if they even have it on 
their system as happened with mine since they purge inactive records after a 
period of time.  I had to get a form from the DMV and have a police officer 
come by, verify the information on the vehicle and sign the form.  This 
enabled the DMV to put the vehicle back on their system.  Course... then you 
have the insurance paperwork etc..

&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a bus that has been sitting for 12 years.  It
&gt; &gt; has plates, but the registration sticker is too deteriorated to read.
&gt; &gt; I have a hand written bill of sale.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is the best approach to take with the DMV to get it registered?
&gt;
&gt;From my experience and failing memory, you obtain insurance first, and
&gt;take the rear plate, bill of sale, and yourself into the DMV, and tell'em
&gt;you bought it, and you need to create a new pink slip, and get it
&gt;registered. Take some blank checks too. That oughta do it.
