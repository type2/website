&gt; After draining the torque converter fluid per the bently manual,  there is
&gt; no mention of refilling before installation.  does it refill automatically
&gt; from the tranny?

it will refill automatically, be sure and top up the tranny after it
refills and don't rev the engine until it is full, shouldn't take more
than a minute or two
