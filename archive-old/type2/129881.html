Subject: Re: Rear Wheel Not Turning

I put new drums on over new shoes as well.  I experienced the same 
thing.  Make darn sure that the drum is true (square) to the axle.

I noticed that one (or both) of the bolts did not turn freely all the 
in.  Usually I can work them in finger tight all they way down.  Upon 
closer inspection, I noticed that the hole in the drum wasn't seated 
flush all the way around the hub.  It was barely perceptible, but I 
pulled the drum back off (with a lot of persuasion this time) and then 
reseated it, making sure it was even all the way around.  It took a 
little hammering to do this.  The bolts then went in finger tight all 
the way and all was right with the world.

When I took the old drums off (they were original) and compared them 
with the replacements, the fit and finish just wasn't the same.  This 
is to be expected with aftermarket parts.
