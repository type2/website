&gt; install a cigg outlet, and buy an inverter and a little floor heater?

sounds like a good idea BUT it won't work....too many watts for your
alternator/generator battery would be dead before you got warm

&gt; whaddya think?
&gt; 
&gt; If theres an aftermarket heater I could install that would be just as easy 
&gt; and a little more long term, id be willing to give that a shot.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any ideas, comments.

check the archives, the only thing that works is a &quot;perfect&quot; stock system
and not real cold temps or some sort of aux fuel heater.

I ski and fought this problem for years, finally broke down and put in a
gas fired aux heater, lots of work but lots of heat.  (I was driving in
Vermont at 12 degrees in a light jacket and the window cracked last year)
