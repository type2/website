Re: [T2] What is it?/hazard -79 Westy



&gt; A coupla questions for you smart folk!
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  What is this wierd little spring loaded doohickey center under my
&gt; dash?  
&gt; http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/MVC-111F.JPG
&gt; Just wondering...
 
I can not tell from the picture, but is this near your E-brake. If so it is
a button that when out lights the brake light in the dash denoting that the
E-brake is on. The light is supposed to go off when the switch is depressed.
Mine was disconnected when I bought it and still is.
