Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window update

Hey, been there- When it happened to me at a toll booth, I stopped and 
made a shim with wood picked up by the road and wedged the window up 
from below so we did not freeze on 4 hr ride home.  Later I cut 2 shims 
from 1x3 stock and wedged them between the bottom of the window cavity 
and the glass bottom to keep it all the way up.  .  This gives you room 
to work and move the crank to position the broken holder where you want. 
  The U shape on the glass can be TAPPED OFF with a hammer if you use 
something wide enough like a door hinge or what I used, a tool with a 
curved chisel-like end 3&quot; wide and a cat's paw puller at the other- I 
think it's for windows.  Rest this agains the u-piece and tap down 
wards- it is held to the glass by a rubber shim, so you can try silicone 
spray to loosen it from the glass.  Even a flat screwdriver hit on one 
side should start it moving. Once the U is off, you can decide whether 
to JBweld/bolt it to the part going up and down, or do what I did, 
remove/replace with parter pull the entire tube holding the spiral and 
the crank connection- it will come out if you remove the holding screws 
and bend it into a tighter U until it pulls out.
