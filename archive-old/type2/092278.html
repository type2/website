Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters

If you want just a glow to see by, consider a light holding a diode or a
group of diodes. I use a bright 2 diode light you can buy in Walmart-
supposedly will run like 100 hours on AA batts.  Stands on its own or
hang it around your neck.
They are not that cheap, but a typical 3 volt white diode is around $4
at RS.  Put 4 in series and I guarantee decent light for months on a car
battery!  I took 3 and put them on a little 9 volt battery for over a
month- still were going!  These things consume milliamps of power.
