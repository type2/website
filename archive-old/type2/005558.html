Subject: [T2] Fuel injector repair


&gt;The short piece of hose from one of the injectors to the fuel ring is
&gt;cracked. It sprays fuel when touched.

&gt;Can I replace that hose or should I buy a new injector?

You can save the injector, but it takes a little skill to cut the old hose band off.
use a hand tool, like a fine metal saw blade, it's slower than an air cutting disc.
you will find a raised single barb at the end, don't slice there, or it will leak.
Cut enough, and you can twist the rest with a pliers. Razor blade the hose.
Reinstall with proper FI quality hose and preferably a FI clamp ( a band ,
tightens with a machine screw ). Good solid 50 cent repair.
