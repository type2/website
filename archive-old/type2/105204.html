Subject: Re: [T2] Re: getting rid of joulise windows

Yes, as Joel said, it is more of a personal preference than anything else. I 
just dont like the look of the joulise windows, just like i dont like the 
look of the poptop campers. I was just interested in if it was possible. Not 
if it was practical, but i should have figured that I would be getting some 
of that personal opinion from the last. Thanks for the input though.

Oh and Joel, you said the seals were $20 for the solid windows. Where from?? 
Thanks again everyone for the discussion

Joey
