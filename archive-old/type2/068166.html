Hmmm... As of Monday evening, nobody's managed to provide an answer to the
spark plug/compression test engine cold/hot conundrum.  Interesting...

I'll try it this way.  Here's what I do, and please feel free to comment.
I just want to find the best procedure with the lowest risk of stripping
plugs.  Plug stripping is a particular concern for me since I live in an
apartment building with an underground garage I can't work on my bus in, so
if I strip a plug I can't just merrily pull the head to have a helicoil or
whatever zapped in.
________
Engine cold.  I *carefully* remove each plug in turn, taking the
opportunity to check condition, gap or replace as indicated.  Smear
anti-sieze on plug threads.  I have the copper stuff, and I'm glad to hear
Bob approves.  Re-insert plugs.

Warm up engine.  *Carefully* pull plugs again.  Do the compression test
thing.  Smear anti-seize.  Re-insert plugs.  Be thankful my heads remain
unstripped for a while longer.
________

I'd rather not pull the plugs twice.  Advice on simplification welcome.
