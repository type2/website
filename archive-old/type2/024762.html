Subject: Two fixes: starter and oil pressure/temp
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

1) I had the same hot starter problem with my 81 Westy that many others have. 
The relay fix didn't accomplish anything and in fact it may have been the 
relay that &quot;chattered&quot; at me when attempting a hot start. Periodically I'd 
have the same problem even when not hot so I replaced the starter with no 
improvement. 

Finally I did the cheap fix which was to thoroughly clean the battery posts 
and clamps as well as remake the ground. I'm now two weeks failure free.

FYI, my next step was going to be removing the heater flapper valve on the 
starter side and use some flexible pipe to route the hot air down and out 
rather than baking the starter. Would that make sense?

2) For years my oil of choice had been PepBoys synthetic 20/50 at the 
reasonable price of $3/qt. They discontinued that just in time for summer so 
I reverted to 20/50 dino and saw my temps soar in summer and the pressure 
drop way below the 30psi I like to see at highway speeds. In Georgia's 90* 
summers I routinely run 235* to 250* and now risked exceeding those temps if 
I ran over 55mph.

I tried Mobil 1 15/50 but that proved nearly as unsatisfactory. Porsches and 
vettes don't run at buslike temperatures.

Searching around for other Synthetics I came across Red Line as the only 
brand that specifically references air cooled motors and engines that run at 
225* plus. I bought six quarts and what a difference. I can run much faster, 
much cooler and maintain pressure in the 30 to 40 psi range. 

What's the punchline? $8 a quart!! If you don't leak it's not all that bad 
since the change interval is more like 9 to 12,000 miles with a filter in 
between. Obviously I'm interested in cheaper alternatives but this stuff 
absolutely works.
