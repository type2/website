Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

&gt;BTW - where
&gt;are you going to mount the sensor so that it will tell
&gt;you anything about your engine? If only a single
&gt;sensor, better to go to exhaust temp sensor as it will
&gt;monitor all 4 and maybe help you catch a problem. -BaH


I beg to differ--how many buses out there run quad CHT or have any EGT 
gauges at all??  How many miles have been driven without these CRITICAL 
instruments or anything beyond the idiot light??   I like gauges and so 
mount my CHT at plug #3--and it tells me a LOT--about the temp at plug #3.

if the engine is running smooth and even and the valves are set right, I 
can tell how hard to charge up a mountain by monitoring the head temp at 
#3, if it goes much above 450F I back off the throttle.

since I don't OWN and don't plan on buying a EGT setup until I get that 
starter Cessna, this will have to work--not for &quot;problem catching&quot; but 
so that I can monitor and keep operating parameters IN GENERAL within 
normal limits under normal operation.  I check the valves every 1-2k 
miles and check the timing and dwell sometimes more often than that.  
stainless exhaust valves due for replacement at 50k, standard valves 
sooner.  this is on a lowly type1 engine so ymmv on t4 with seat probs 
or bakelite intake blocks prone to cracking. . .

Now, I do have complaints about how the VDO sensor fits on the plug 
(crappy) and I have thought about modding a plug to weld the 
thermocouple junction right to the plug body.

California here we come, via WVA, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Colorado, WY, 
ID.  anyone on the way?
