Help!  I give up :-(  here's the problem:

Car: '73 bus with '80 Vgon block and '78 FI system (getting to be a real
Frankenstein :-(

Got in it last night, started it, no problems.  Drove about a block to a
traffic light, stoipped.  After sitting at the light for ~30 seconds, it
dies.  Restart, get a slight kick, but no start.  After that it cranks
fine, but wont even try to start.

push it off to the side of the road (thank goodness, legal spot) and
called Sean Bartnik.  He came over and we checked dwell.  It's at 80
degrees on my analog guage.  Try to reset it, slight movements move it
from 0 to 80 to 0 w/o ever getting anywhere near close to right.  Pull the
dist, install new points and condensor (gotta rig the condensor, as it is
the wrong one :-(  put the dist back in the car.  Same symptoms, and
midnight approaches.  Test power to coil, 11.9V, power at condensor wire
while cranking ~4V.  This AM I pulled the dist again and t4ested the
vacuum advance, not perfect but not bad.  per the VOM, points are opening
and closing correctly (resistance goes 0/1/0/1 like it ought).  My next
thought is coil, as the provenance of this coil is unknown.  Anyone with
ideas?

BTW, I am writing from this account as my ari_dot_net account (where I get
list mail) is FUBAR this AM :-( so please respond to me here (in addition
to the list, if you think it's a solution of general applicability)
