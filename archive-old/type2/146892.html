Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

On my 71 camper back in the late 70's we put on a pinto 2-barrel 
progressive carb (second throat opens when nearly floored), using an 
adaptor on the stock manifold that raised the carb- I designed my own 
holder consisting of a plate screwed to the carb lip that extended it 
3/4&quot; beyond a toyota air filter diameter (8 or 9&quot; by 3&quot; tall).   This 
plate had 6
eyebolts fastened at the edge these held springs about 1&quot; long.  Another 
plate was made that looked like the lower, and had a  bent pipe epoxied 
into it to accept the breather hose.  One had to lay the filter between 
the lower eybolts, slide the plate above it, and then use 6 springs 
clipped to the upper eyebolts to lock it all down.  That carb did not 
affect my milage  really, but allowed great acceleration when one 
floored it.
