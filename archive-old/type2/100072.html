Subject: Oily heater air

Am I breathing exhaust?
The heater cables in my 77 are broken so I wired the heater flaps open and
enjoyed some heat today.  Then when I parked next to a white wall, I noticed
what looked like oily smoke coming out of the defroster vent.  I turned on
the blower, and yup, it increased it.  Now I know I have a few oil leaks,
but am I venting oil smoke into the van?  Note:  My passengers in the rear
noticed a definite exhaust smell in the back.
