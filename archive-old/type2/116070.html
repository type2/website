The foam tends to accumulate because of short trip driving habits. If you
don't do this as much you won't get as much foam.

VW states in the owners manual, &quot;We recommend more frequent oil changes if
you drive your car only short distances during the winter months&quot;. I think
this is a good idea. I also believe in changing the filter every time but
that's another debate.

I've found that by having the proper gasket under the oil filler cap you can
seal it off better and reduce the foam.

Any foam collecting where the dipstick goes should probably be deal with by
getting another one. Mine is a tight seal and I've never seen foam there.

&gt; Water is a by-product of combustion in gasoline engines (fuel made of
&gt; hydrocarbons + O2 == H2O + CO + CO2).

Air (O2 + N + trace elements) is the first reactant not pure oxygen. The
combustion by-products are:

= H20 + N + CO2 + HC + CO + NOx

&gt; Now, if the engine oil gets hot enough, the water will boil off.

Whatever collected in the oil breather tube or oil filler spout before the
oil temperature reaches 212F usually remains in my experience.

&gt; Anyway, this blow-by is to be expected on old engines.  Those piston
&gt; rings have been at it for over 20 years, after all (more like 30 for a
&gt; 1700 engine).  If your engine is running well, and isn't leaking oil,
&gt; it probably still has a fair amount of service left in it.

Some blow-by happens regardless of engine age. New vehicles still have PCV
valves and if it didn't the piston/cylinder wear would be considerable.
