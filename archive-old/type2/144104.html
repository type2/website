Subject: Re: [T2] Solar Battery Charger

FYI, Harbor Freight sells them for ridiculously cheap prices.

They have some REALLY nice ones too. 


The Harbor Freight catalog is about as manly of a catalog as you can get.  I don't know what I would do with a 2 ton electric garage hoist... but damn it sure does look cool. They sell A/C compressors... you name it. They basically have everything you could need for a garage or to take care of a car.
