&gt; I was poking around in the engine compartment of our 
&gt; other 1972 Bus today (the camper).  I noticed the oil 
&gt; filler and oil dipstick are mounted on top of the engine.  
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the oil dipstick on the camper doesn't come out all
&gt; the way since it hits the top of the engine compartment,
&gt; and being a '72, there is no hatch to remove.
&gt; 
&gt; I also found the nuts for the valve adjusters are 14mm, while
&gt; the nuts on the blue '72 and our '71 Squareback are 13mm.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From this information I would guess the engine in our
&gt; camper has been replaced.  But with what?  It certainly
&gt; looks like a Type 4 engine, but is it a later (and
&gt; possibly larger) than 1972 and 1700cc?  What other
&gt; clues can I look for?


it is either a 1700 or 1800 &quot;real&quot; type 4 engine from a 411 or 412 fast
back sedan of 1971-1974  they had to have the oil checked from the top
since there was no rear opening to get to the engine
