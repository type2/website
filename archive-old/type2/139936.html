Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping VW Freight from Canada

it's a pain to get things like that across the border...perhaps you 
can find a list member to drive it down to Washington state (assuming 
they are close to the border...Vancouver is only 30-45 minutes from 
Washington state).

 From Washington try posting an ad on 
http://seattle.craigslist_dot_org/rid/ or http://www_dot_uship_dot_com  and even 
posting on Craiglist in Vancouver might be worth a try...

I had a Vanagon engine shipped from Tacoma to San Francisco via a 
Craigslist rideshare posting.  In fact, I had about 6 people that 
responded to the ad and offered to haul it for me.

A guy coming south with a uhaul picked it up in Tacoma and dropped it 
off in San Francisco for only $60 less than 24 hours after he picked 
it up.

&gt;What is the cheapest way to send an engine from BC to Texas? Anyone 
&gt;ever shipped big heavy things across the border?
