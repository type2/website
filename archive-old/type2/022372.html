&gt;So, if I go all-out, like I usually do, where would I put the equalizer/amps?? I am also planning on installing a complete entertainment system in this thing (TV, VCR, and video game package) like on the newer vans. Do I need a larger alternator/battery?? 

Probably not.  Those devices you mentioned do not draw a lot of current.  Now if you're talking about a large TV or running them for hours or days with the engine off, you will have to invest in an auxiliary battery.  Plenty of info on that in the archives at vw.i405_dot_com.

FYI, I saw the ultimate deep-cycle batteries at West Marine yesterday.  They are tall (like 24&quot; tall) flooded cells, true deep-cycle, 6V, 350 amp-hours.  Two of them in series would do yah, yes indeed.  Only problem is that they weigh 120lbs each.  Oh, and they are $209 each - ouch.
