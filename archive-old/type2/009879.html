Hey All --
This question has to do with part of the exhaust system on my 79.  On the
driver's side &quot;U&quot; of the crossover pipe before it gets to the catalytic
converter, there is what looks like a large bolt-like thing sticking out of
the pipe.  It is threaded and about 1.5 inches long, with what looks like a
6-sided nut on top.  Can anyone tell me what this is for?  (I had always
thought it was some type of sensor or something...)  I sheared it almost
halfway off after backing into a stone fountain in La Paz (B.C.S.) last
fall, and with some exhaust repairs/replacements coming up, I was curious
and thought I'd better find out for sure.  I hope this isn't a stupid
question, as I wasn't able to determine it from the archives.  Thanks!
