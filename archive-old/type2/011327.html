Subject: Heads on!!!!, But....

Well,  I torqued the heads down today.  The stud that was twisting out 
last week seemed to do fine. I had put a small White Out mark on the
outside of all the cylinder studs to gage if they were twisting at all.
Some did twist, but only about 1/4 turn. 

But....

One stud twisted in half!!!  Right in the middle of the upper threads.
I'm guessing that the nut hit a small piece of grit in the threads which
stopped the nut from turning any more.  That was alright though,  I had
an extra from the old single port :).  

Here's my concern:  the 1-2 head is fine(18lbs.)  OTOH the 3-4 head has
some nuts that have made it to 18lbs(about 3) and some that,  although
I keep turning the torque wrench (beam type),  seem to not want to get 
any tighter then about 15lbs.  I stopped because I was getting scared 
that I might; a) strip something, b) break another stud.

Could it be that I'm still pulling the head down?  Could the aluminum in 
the head be compacting?(new Brazilian DP)
Can I stop at 15lbs?  
Did I forget any thing??

Scared to torque anymore,
