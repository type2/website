&gt; Heck, put the spare on top or in front, and saw down that protruding

*gasp* must... restart... heart..... *pound*pound*pound*

hehe, normally, i would have, but the interior to this bus is like 95%
pristine and while I can sooooo dig the modifications folks have made to
their buses (I've seen your pages and have gotten sooo many good ideas for
the next project) this one is going to stay as stock as possible.

&gt; If you must, find a 2&quot; stove bolt of the right threadage and twirl up a
&gt; wingnut backwards until it binds.

That's kind of what I have now (i drove it without one for a while and
kept having the damn thing fall out), I just have no idea what the stock
bolt looks like.
