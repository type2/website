All,


This post sums up the only real downside to owning and
driving a bus....everyone assumes that we are all like
ol' ras dave, here.

Not only is this post WAY off topic, but it's
inapropriate and foolish as well. Perhaps a little
less &quot;herb&quot; would allow him to see that.

Now, I don't care what drugs you or anyone else choose
to do, but please...keep it to yourself and don't give
the rest of us a bad image. It's bad enough already.


Jaime
