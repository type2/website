Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing fuel line hints

That's one SMART idea... would be cool if you could have an electric one
of some sort so you wouldn't have to crawl under the car to turn it
on/off..

But I think eventually I'm just going to do something with the EFI
system wired to a kill switch.. that's probably just as good and much
easier to do :)

&gt; I like Bob's idea of a shut off valve, too.  Would be a painless theft
&gt; protection of a sort as well.
