Subject: [T2] Poor College Student  goes cross country and back in VW bus he puts together

Dear type2,

    My name is Yucel Kuday (aka Poor College Student) and I just got back a 
week ago from my cross country trip I took in my 1975 VW Westy that I 
basically put together.  First and foremost I would like to thank the Type2 
list and members for all your knowledge and help putting my bus together and 
making my trip possible.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Steve Dolan and 
Pat Flynn this past weekend in Manassas VA and talked both of their ears off 
(both are a encyclopedia of bus knowledge and class acts).
   The trip started in NJ.  I got as far west as I could (umm the Pacific 
Ocean) then went from Vancouver BC to San fran doing the coast and seeing 
everything in between. States I hit up; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Wisconsin (I now love Wisconsin), Minnesota, South and North 
Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California.  All in 
all I put a little over 11,000 miles on my bus this summer and only lost 2 
fan belts and a speedometer cable throughout the whole trip (unbelievable 
huh). Met two other guys (Mike and Ben) driving cross country one bought his 
bus for $75 and the other $175 and both were running well (both Love 
busses).
   I again want to thank the Type2 community for making this the best Summer 
of my life.  I will forever own my 75 Westy ( BAM-BAM ) and am a type2 guy 
for life.  Special thanks to Steve Dolan for keeping this list going.

Peace

Yucel Kuday
75 Westy ( BAM-BAM )
73 Westy Jerry Rig ( Blue ) this bus did the whole last dead tour
