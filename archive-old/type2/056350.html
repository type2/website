Subject: Screens for 78-79 sliding windows

I also found another pair of aftermarket window screens. These mount on 
the outside of the sliding window with 4 screws each. [if anyone has 
seen Charlie Fords Mothership these are the same style as I sent him a 
while ago]

Anybody want/need/gotta have 'em?  $10 + mail for the pair. Only the 
second pair I've seen in the last 4 years.
