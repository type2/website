Martin,

Thanks for this post. I have several friends who travel regularly to
Mexico, and also have two Bay busses I'm restoring.

If you don't mind me asking, what did you pay for the windows and did
you get them from the dealer or an aftermarket supplier ?

As you know, the aluminum sliding windows used in the US were a 1.5 to 2
year only item (78-79) but fit all bay window busses. The later Vanagon
sliders were the wrong size for the bay bus. (Although they look alike.)

I would certainly like to import these, as I am working on an interior
package which I plan to market later  this year, consisting of an oak
package tray, wood dash trim kit, console which really fits the bays and
a full underdash closure.

Many Thanks,

Michael Lewis

It is a set of three, as on the left rear there is also a sliding
window.
There is no sliding window for behind the sliding door available for
safety reasons (stick your head out and someone opens the sliding door).
It is a mystery why no-one has started to import these windows. They
have all the DOT stamps and are available with different tints and in
green. I'm sure they would sell well.
