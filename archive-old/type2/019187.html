Volks:

While trying to take the maiden voyage today I had some trouble.   I
could never get over 20mph.  Severe drag somewhere.  I had to feather
the clutch just to get that fast.  I thought stuck brake.  All the
wheels spin by hand.  Not well, but spin.  No noticeable play in the
wheel bearings.  She has been sitting for some time now.  I tried to
adjust the stars, but can't get 'em to budge.  Gonna remove the drums
tomorrow after I find a 46mm socket.  Any suggestions?

thanks
