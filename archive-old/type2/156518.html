&gt; quick question because the reason for asking is too
&gt; long to go into, can the
&gt; potentiometer be adjusted back to the stock position
&gt; if for some reason or
&gt; another a shop thought to be reputable had
&gt; &quot;adjusted&quot; it?  i guess better
&gt; late than never since Goethe is in the same shop as
&gt; they, on their dime,
&gt; reset the potentiometer.  this is the FI on a '75 ED

The potentiometer? How's about placing us somewhere
near to where you're thinking! Are you referring to
the airflow meter on a stock L-Jetronic FI?

If so, I've heard of people &quot;fiddling&quot; with the spring
adjustments and looked into that myself a few weeks
before replacing both heads and the airflow meter.
It's been a quite few years ago. I figured out that
wasn't really the way to go - about $2000 later!

Did I guess right? -BaH
