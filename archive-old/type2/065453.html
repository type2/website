I wouldn't agree completely, after my VW factory rebuild bit the 
dust, my trusted mechanic spotted several problems with their work.
Now that I have a trusted mechanic, trusted mechanic will do any work.
Find a good and trusty mechanic for advice and work.
&lt;and now for the plug . . . Vallero's in Auburn, California&gt;
