Subject: Battery Tray Treatment - POR 15 - Pelucid

Both battery pan sides of the engine in NewBus are completely rust free.
The original paint on the battery trays, when rubbed with a damp cloth, 
clean up  to look near show room new.

I cleaned them both with a strong de-greasing cleaner , then a strong soap 
and water solution.

After they dried completely, I went ahead and brushed on a rust converter 
just to seek out and convert anything I did not see in the way of crevice 
rust or the such.

I then painted both of them with POR 15 Pelucid.
I also painted a sample piece to observe what this stuff does as it goes 
through the drying process.

I observed the test painting sample evolve from just applied wet, to tacky, 
to leathery, to a plastic consistency, then to a final hard coat.

I will let the actual trays set up for a few days before I put the 
batteries back on them.

I am hoping this stuff does as it proclaims it will do in the way of 
serving as a &quot;super coat&quot; of a non-porous and non-breathing very hard 
coating to the original paint and metal.

Anybody out there used this stuff, and if so what did you receive in the 
way of performance from it. Where did you use it. How did you use it?

The stuff looks good to me so far, but I have yet to see what the results 
become in the long run.

I am pulling the engine on Casper next week just to check it out and make 
sure it is all ready for our next 6-7 month trip we put him to. I have 
already treated those battery pans with the regular POR 15 stuff. I'll let 
you know how they look after one year's time of being in the wets of the 
Great Northwest, etc. from last Summers' trip. If they look OK, I guess 
I'll go ahead and coat them with this Pelucid, as well.
