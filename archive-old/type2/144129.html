&gt; Where can I get an accurate tire guage? My gauges around here vary by

&gt; you're never quite sure!

Get thee to a dune buggy or race car shop and buy an Accu-Gage:

I use an H60XA, but an S60XA is a bit more compact.

These guages are reliable and accurate.  I've used them for years.  Forget
the silly electronic and talking varieties, though.  Why get something
that needs a battery when an analog gauge will do as well?
