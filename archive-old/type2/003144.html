Bob, the guy with the wandering dwell, here:

Suddenly it all comes into focus. While doing a quickie emergency rebuild on
my distributor I tried to get the breaker plate out without taking out the
points. Naturally, the points themselves got caught on something and I bent
the pee out of them before I realized why the stinking breaker plate
wouldn't come lose. I put the points back together, but I must have weakened
the spring in the meantime. Which would explain why they are &quot;floating&quot; as
the RPMs increase.

Now, about that shimming stuff. I actually took the entire dizzy apart, even
knocked the little pin out of the drive dog, and shimmed the shaft until
there was &quot;just a smidgeon&quot; (machinist's term) of vertical play left in the
shaft. In other words, when I grab the shaft from the top and try to push it
up and down, it don't go far. Was that wrong of me? I figured less play is
better than a lot of play, as long as there was a little play left. Follow?

If, as one person suggested, the breaker plate is worn out and moving back
and forth instead of in a circle, how does one remedy that?
