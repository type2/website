Steve:
I guess maybe there's not much disagreement, except in inference. I don't
really clean them or take them apart in any way except to WIPE the old grease
off the outside (inside the boot) of the joint with paper towels. I NEVER
take them apart.
I'd not recommend such a strategy in desert climates or where you knew there
was a good deal of contamination. And yes, the boots are usually shot.

What I'd really intended on was to ramble into a discussion of what wondrous
things these are and ask whether anyone knew who'd thought them up. Very
early 911's (64-66) used non-CV u-joints called Nadellas. Corvairs, Tempests,
63 up  Corvettes also used Spicer-type u-joints which did not work as good as
these.
I'd guess Loebro has a patent. does anybody know about the history or
developement of Loebro CV joints?
