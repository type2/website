Subject: Dipstick boot

Are there any tricks to reinstall the dipstick boot without taking the fan
housing and all off?  Just got the engine back from mechanic and replaced my
tin and went to replace dipstick and it wouldn't go.  Look under to see why
and one side of the dipstick boot is off.  The top if it matters.  Any
ideas?  I can't find the procedure or mention of it in Bentley and don't
really want to take it all back apart if I don't have to.. :(

Thanks for any ideas..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
snoopy
