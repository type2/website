Arch,
I just went through what you are talking about with my '60 Double cab.  Just
finished a couple weeks ago.

You are half way there already, starting with the '69.  I had to go out and get a
beam from a '69 and rebuild it.

&gt; One of the many things I'd like to do is improve the
&gt; braking.  [...].  After a look in the library and a search of the archives, I am
&gt; left with a number of questions:

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone make a four wheel disc brake conversion
&gt; for the bus?

Haven't seen one

&gt; Can a bug conversion kit be used?

There are those out there, I don't like the idea of putting bug brake components
on a bus.  Especially a heavier westy.

&gt; What about a competition kit?  (one manufacturer
&gt; claims that their product will stop a Drag car from
&gt; 150 mph, but will it stop a bus from 75 mph?)

Can't comment on that.

&gt; If I can use a bug kit, will it fit bus 14&quot; rims? or
&gt; can I use bug 15&quot; rims and adjust tire size
&gt; accordingly?

See my above comments about bug kits :-)

&gt; Do I really want four wheel disc brakes, or should I
&gt; leave the rear brakes drum?

I kept the rear brakes drums, I believe most of the stopping is done by the front
and the rears are there to keep you going straight.

&gt; Any advice and counsel is appreciated...

Go to the junkyard and pull Everything off of a '73 to '79 bus front end.
You want to pull off from the torsion arms out.
Torsion arms, spindles, calipers, hubs, wheels.  While you are there grab the
brake servo, master cylinder, reservoir (lower &amp; upper), check valve back in the
engine compartment.  Don't forget the brake lever from the pedal to the servo and
the proportioning valve between the MC and rear brakes.

All that should cost you less than $100.  The ecology wrecking yard in Wilmington,
CA  has a ton of these front ends lined up and Saturday June 2nd is their 50% off
day.

Once you get that stuff home, you want to send off to one of the many vendors on
this list for some replacement parts:
Ball Joints, 4 needed ($17/ea) [$68]
Wheel Bearings &amp; Seals ($17/side) [$34]
Caliper o-rings and dust seals (~$4/side) [$8]
New brake hoses  ($11/ea) [$22]
Brake pads ($15/side) [$30]
New Shock Absorbers ($27/ea) [$54]
New Master Cylinder ($30)

All that with shipping should be around $250.  Add the junk yard trip and all the
part you need for a brand new brake system is $350.

I then took the torsion arms and new ball joints to a local VW repair shop and for
$20 he popped the old ones out and new ones in.  I left them there for him and he
was able to do them on his time rather than stopping what he was doing while I
waited.

While the torsion arms are out, replace the bearings and seals on everything and
clean up the discs.

The torsion arms will bolt right up where your torsion arms were.

When the arms come back, pull out all the old stuff and bolt the new stuff in
reverse order.

If you already have a servo, you can just replace your master cylinders.  I had to
fabricate a mounting plate and weld it to the beam so the servo had a place to
mount.

Again, if you already have a servo, you don't have to worry about running a vacuum
line from the servo to the engine compartment.  I used a piece of 1/2&quot; copper and
heavy duty 1/2&quot; reinforced tubing at each end.  The check valve with the arrow
towards the engine should be located in the engine compartment.

Total Cost for this system: Under $400 with taxes and shipping
Pros:  + You can get replacement parts in almost any FLAPS
           or junkyard, vs using someone's custom setup
       + Fairly inexpensive
       + Designed to stop the heaver bus vs. a bug

Cons:  - Little more work involved in pulling the stuff
          in the junkyard and rebuilding.
       - You will have narrow 5 wheel pattern (14&quot; wheels)
         and wide 5 pattern in the back.
              -

Of course, I feel the pros of this system out weigh the cons.  Heck you are doing
all that work already, what's another day in the junkyard?  Besides, I recharge my
Zen, karma and busma in junkyards :-)

I ended up changing over the rear brakes to use the hubs from a '79 bus.  (all
four wheel, and brake, spindles, hubs etc. cost me $125 at the junk yard)  All
four of my wheels now match.

One word of warning.  DO NOT DRIVE ON JUNKYARD TIRES!!!!!!!

I'll say that again.  DO NOT DRIVE ON JUNKYARD TIRES!!!!!!

The four tires that I pulled off had lots of tread but must have been sitting for
a while.  The rubber was hard but not such that you could tell.  I discovered it
in a very frightening manner a few days after putting the brakes on.  I was
heading east on a major hwy about 40 mph.  I saw a car up ahead preparing to exit
a WalMart parking lot and turn left and head west.  I guess the guy didn't see me,
so he pulled out and stopped in my lane waiting for westbound traffic to clear.  I
laid into my brakes and immediately went into a sliding skid.  One that did not
result in any reduction in speed.  VERY Scary..  He saw me at the last minute and
pulled just enough to let me pass.  The tires came off the next day and were
replaced with four nice BRAND NEW tires.   Junkyard tires, never again for me, no
matter how nice they look.  It was one of the scariest experiences that I have
ever had.

The rubber marks are still out there on Carson Street.  I pointed them out to my
daughter yesterday, commenting on how lucky I was.

If I opened a new round of questions, fire away.

Scott
