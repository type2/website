Subject: `70 front beam

Don't know anything about this (not affiliated with seller), but saw it at
TheSamba and thought that someone in CA might be interested in checking it
out:

Section... Type 2/Bus - 1968-up - Parts - For Sale
Title..... free  1970 bus beam - complete!
Price..... FREE
Name...... Robert K
EMail..... WVtoH_at_aol_dot_com
Phone#.... (714) 256-9327
Location.. Fullerton (SoCal), California, USA
Description:
Front beam removed 1 year ago and taking up valuable garage floor space ever
since!  Come and get it! Unit is in great shape and complete drum to drum
but I switched to discs so I no longer need this behemoth...maybe you can
use it complete or just for parts. At least the price is right :)
