Subject: Re: [T2] Help! ran out of gas and now bus won't start

If you don't get any fuel from the tank, one &quot;fix&quot; of sorts is to blow 
compressed air back up the line.  It doesn't really fix much of anything 
if there is actually something clogging the line, but at least you'll 
know where the problem lies.

To do this, I'd use compressed air, NOT your mouth and have an 
extinguisher handy.  Also, remove the gas cap and this is NOT 
recommended if you have a full tank of gas - it WILL flow out the cap.

But if Rick's tests check out, then you want to check that you have the 
correct fuel pressure.  Hook up a fuel pressure gauge to the tap and run 
through the tests in the bentley.  This is one of the first test in the 
EFI testing procedures.  Somewhere online is the actual bosch L-Jet 
testing guide.  I'd highly recommend going through that step-by-step to 
make sure that you don't miss anything.

If you really can't get hold of a fuel pressure tester, but want to test 
if there's fuel flow, when you push the flap, you will hear the fuel 
flowing through the rail.  You should also hear the fuel pressure 
regulator letting fuel back into the tank.

Also, make sure you ignition system is working perfectly (I think the 
first step in the bosch l-jet testing procedure..)

&gt; Check fuel flow to the pump:
&gt;  
&gt; Remove the hose from the bottom of the tank. Any flow? I had a foriegn object blocking the tank outlet once.
&gt;  
&gt; Then remove the hose from the filter to the pump. Any flow from the filter? I got a tank of gas full of crap once that clogged the filter.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; checked for spark, have that, fuel pump runs while
&gt; cranking and manually pushing the flap open on AFM. 
&gt; My diagnosis is that fuel pump, althought running is
&gt; not actually pumping.  any other suggestions on the
&gt; cause before i order a new one.  any way of testing
&gt; old one?
