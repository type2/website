Subject: VW Resto -- Coralee

Thom --

Concerning Richmond sources, I know of a fellow in Salem [Roanoke]... but only 
by his participation on the Type 2 List and some e-correspondence.  His name is 
Mark Dearing... seems like a good guy.

There is a high-class restoration company known as &quot;White Post&quot; that has been 
featured in the Washington newspapers; prob'ly locatable by Googling.

Maybe some of the others on the list can help Coralee?  I think she may need to 
accept that anyone who works on autos as a business needs to make a profit, in 
order to feed his/her family.  That said, there are lots of guys who will lend 
a helping hand or contribute a helpful idea, and this list is one of the best.

Good luck,
Glenn in Maryland
