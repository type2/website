That was tempered glass, not safety glass.  Tempered glass is heated and
cooled in a particular way so as to put the surface of the glass under
compression and the interior under tension.  Glass under compression is
much stronger than normal glass, so the glass can stand up to abuse on its
faces.  However, the center of the glass is correspondingly more fragile
and as you found, a minor blow on the edge will shatter the entire glass.
The entire glass shatters because of the built-up stresses in the inner
layer.

Safety glass is a laminate of glass and plastic and does not shatter like
tempered glass.  It is used in automobile windshields because drivers
don't really want to have their windshields dissolve into a layer of glass
kibbles if they get hit by a rock.
