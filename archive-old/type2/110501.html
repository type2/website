&gt; Hiya George,

&gt; &quot;They don't seem to be
&gt; replacable and new manifolds don't seem to be in the offing. &quot;
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps I am misreading this (if so, please disregard), but I take this to
&gt; mean that new/replacement manifolds for a 1600 dp are not to be had.  On the
&gt; contrary I have purchased (from my FLAPS) three piece replacement intake
&gt; manifolds.

Good point.  How do the heat riser tubes seal to the center section?
Since there is exhaust going through that tube I want to keep in inside!

How long have you had this manifold in service?  How does it seem to be h
olding up corrosion-wise?

Although I prefer stock German parts, I'm willing to look at a better
idea!
