Very wise advice!  While my method worked for me, I would certainly advise
anyone in *any* doubt to hit the machine shop first.  

One of the lessons it took me way too long to learn was to give the
machinist first crack at any job in which I was doubtful of my abilities,
before I bent it, before I broke it off flush, whatever.  If you do this,
you (a) will save time, money, and many vocabulary lessons and (b)
probably earn a hearty &quot;thank you&quot; and place at the front of the line from
the machinist.  I have learned that by and large, they prefer to deal with
un-buggered problems (I will not mention the occasional masochist
machinist :-)
