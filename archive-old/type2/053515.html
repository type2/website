This doesn't completely answer your question, but...
With a driver of average build seated in one of the cab seats (important
point), the cargo floor should be parallel to the ground.

&gt; enquire, what is
&gt; the usual height (ground to a measureable point), of both 
&gt; front and rear 
&gt; suspensions?
&gt; I'm pretty sure the rear is OK, but the front appears to have 
&gt; a slight 
&gt; &quot;California Rake&quot;.
