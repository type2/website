Hey Volks,

   After meeting a listmember over the weekend I decided it was time to inspect my bus and do what it was meant to due. Drive it. I've let other projects come first and neglected to renew the yearly hassle. I was not prepared for what would come of this years must fix to pass list. here is a short example....

too much body roll needs shocks. he only drove it from the parking lot into the bay.

turn signal indicator not securely fastened to column.

turn indicator lights not flashing to alert of turn signals on.

no dust boot on master cylinder. shame on me. I should have that.

no defrost motor. 

micro holes under feet in front floor board. exhaust hazard.

Now is it me or is this insane? By the way, here in southern VA you can pump all the pollution into the air you want. But be safe while you do it. Good grief that's next.
rant over. thanks I needed that
