&gt;Yea Richard, i will. This time, i'm stuck with hydro lifter.... for now.
&gt;But i don't have much problem on Vanagon's with them, 1 to 1.5 turn IN 
&gt;and we are ok...
&gt;I also suspect valve not closing enough.

The leakdown test is great for this. I have found that the lifter can pump up the valve and only when you release it you'll get much better numbers. I guess it's a misconception that the lifters can only &quot;pump up&quot; at high rpms, at least from my experience.

All that's ever been required for me to get back to normal is to take the pressure off the spring and reset the preload. I do this at TDC for each valve and make note of how many turns are required to release the pressure before I readjust.

FYI. When the exhaust value is stuck open, you should be able to hear the mufller pop pop pop during deceleration.
