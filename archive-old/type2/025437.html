I stopped to help a disabled Adventurewagen near Redding CA last month.  It
was a 68. Red outside and inside. It was very very pretty to look at and
very sad to work on.  The owner had only had it a couple of weeks. She
didn't know or want to kknow much about her bus except that she was driving
and it stopped running.  Fuel filter full of oil, spark plugs gummy and
gassy and black, cracked fuel lines, oil spatter everywhere.  I changed her
battery, filter and plugs, she flodded it when she tried to start it up and
asked for a ride to Redding which I gave her.  I don't know what happened
nest but I have been won
