Subject: Where do I get a refrigerator for my 78?

Are you looking for the factory unit or an aftermarket type? My 78' westy
came with a Dometic unit that runs on 12v or 110. Actually its 12v from a
transformer powered by 110 but anyway. Where are you located? I know a
boneyard on the eastern shore of Maryland that has one sitting in a bus
already unbolted and unplugged. I don't know if it still works. Looks okay
to me, also don't know what Dick Potter wants for it. I have his phone
number if you want it. Don't know if he'll ship anything.
