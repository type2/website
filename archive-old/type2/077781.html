&gt; Sounds like the perfect answer for a singlecab or double-cab, they wouldn't
&gt; have to put it on the roof, it could go in one of the lower bulkheads.
&gt; 
&gt; If I sealed the space under the rear-facing seat airtight, would an EU2000i
&gt; fit? How many decibels does it crank out?
&gt; 
&gt; One more thing to put into the WesTrailier I want to build this spring.
&gt; 
According to http://www.hondapowerequipment_dot_com, the EU2000i is 20.1 x 11.4
x 16.7 inches (assume length x width x height) and cranks out 59dB at rated
load. It has a recoil starter, so you'll need access for that, the gas tank
is built into the generator and remember the exhaust.
