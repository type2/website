Yes sir, you make some excellent points. There are two things that make 
up a good collector's car. The first is its rarity, the second is its 
desirability. If, for some reason, there were only 100 pre-68 VW vans in 
the world, their price would jump dramatically. On the other hand, they 
have a reputation that attracts &quot;radicals&quot;, which might make them less 
desirable.

My parents were middle class, mom worked for IRS, dad in a wood mill. 
They bought our '65 deluxe as a family wagon, because of price, 
functionality, and supposed reliability. 30 years later, I'm looking for 
the same van. I've received comments like &quot;oh, you want a drug van&quot; and, 
&quot;why not buy one of the new ones... they are so much better&quot;, etc.

As you say, as long as it's cheaper to restore these vans than to buy a 
restored one (or reasonably close), they will be restored. Personally, 
I've considered buying a couple, but they had moderate cancer rust... 
but I pass on paying $7500 for a fully restored van. I guess I'm guilty 
on both counts... it's not worth enough to fully restore a rusted VW, 
and that's the majority of what's left out there.

Oh well, maybe I'll take my vacation in CA this year. Who knows, I might 
drive back a souvenier.
