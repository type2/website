Subject: Re: [T2] List charter, advertising, ebay.

In response to Ken's suggestion: the type2 site already has a section for 
classified ads: parts/vehicles, and a subsection that only includes listings 
from the past 15 days.  Take advantage of existing resources!!



Another possibility might be to perhaps relax the advertising restrictions, 
but split the advertising off to a third list all of its own. This would 
accommodate both the people who want eBay ads, and the people who want no 
ads at all.
