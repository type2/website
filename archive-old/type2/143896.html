Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

If I might resurrect this year-old thread, while I was replacing brake hoses I
discovered that my left lower ball joint boot is torn.

The ball joints themselves are still tight.

The full ball joint repair procedure sounds horrific.  I don't have a clear
sense, though, of how little or how much I'd have to tear apart just to
replace one boot.

Does anyone know?

Thanks,

- Miles
