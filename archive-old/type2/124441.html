Subject: uh-oh, brake warning light on

Last night I was moving my bus out into the street so my wife could get her
car out of the driveway this morning. When I turned on the headlights, my
brake warning light came on. You know, the little red one with the &quot;B&quot; on it.
Well, when I touched the brake pedal it turned off. Also it only works with
the driving or headlights on.

So my question is, do you think I have a brake problem, or a wiring problem. I
recently replaced my ignition switch so I was fiddling around under the dash a
bit.

Thanks
