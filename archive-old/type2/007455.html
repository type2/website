&gt;List,
&gt;In a moment of blaring idiocy, i took my wiper motor apart (75 camper).  
Man.  Does anyone know how to get those three magnet/brush daddies to 
stay the hell up in their little slots so's i can get the shaft back in 
without involving another person? 

BTDTGTTS:  Use tape.  Duct tape would probably work.  Slide the brushes 
into their slots one by one, then tape over top of them so they don't 
come back out.  Then after putting the &quot;thingy&quot; back into the case, you 
can remove the tape and the brushes will come to their normal positions.  
No problem.  Might take a couple tries to make it work -- had this 
lovely problem-solving experience after pulling apart the wiper motor on 
my '74 Ghia.
