Subject: Re: [T2] re: driver door on baywindow in charlotte area

Hello,
        I'm in the charlotte area also. A&amp;B Imports in Rock Hill (803)
324-4317 has a bus that they are parting out that may still have the door
you need. I have purchased many such parts from A&amp;B and the price has always
been vary reasonable. The only other door that I know of in the area is at a
irregular junk yard below rock hill and nobody needs a door bad enough to
pay his price:) .I've got a 78 westy as well that still isnt finished with
its transistion from junkyard to highway but closer everyday. drop me a
email sometime maybe we have some other parts we could swap.
Hope this helped.
