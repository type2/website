Subject: German listees please note (re renting Eurovan)

I have a sister in Germany who've I've located after years of
separation; she lives about 20 minutes West of Munich (in Haag).  We'd
like to visit her Easter week when our daughter is off and flying rates
are cheap.  Can any German listees get back to me on availability of
renting a small camper like a Westfalia or Eurovan to do some traveling
in?  We'd like to fly to Munich, but would consider Frankfurt if flights
are more reasonable (but then a 4 hr drive is needed when we'd be tired
from overnight flight!)  We'd stay in it by her apartment and use it to
do a bit of traveling also.  Since my sisters spouse is disabled, the
van could help in bringing him along on a trip.  Thanks!
