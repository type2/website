Subject: Re: [T2] Help!! SOLEX carb kit needed..

In a message dated 5/29/06 12:05:29 PM, honeybus_at_gmail_dot_com writes:


&gt; I have a SOLEX carb coded  C34 TCIC / 13  090, made in Italy
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I thought the first character would be a &quot;0&quot;, but this is definately a
&gt; &quot;C&quot;...  And the &quot;C&quot; character is at least 10% larger than the &quot;34&quot; numbers.
&gt; And it is a different &quot;C&quot; than the other pair of &quot;C&quot;s
&gt;
&gt; It is a '2 barrel' carb, with two air intake, and just one of the air
&gt; intakes has a choke.
&gt;
&gt;    Try

&lt;&lt;&lt; www.webercarburetors_dot_com &gt;&gt;&gt;

If the site has your carb you're good to go...If not, they
have an 800 tech # for help...
A lot of those types of carbs were made for particular
cars...Audi, BMW, SAAB, used variations of the Solex/
Weber...But back in the 60's thru' 70's...So parts may
be getting scarce...
