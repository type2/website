Subject: Re: oil filter cross reference

Blake, thanks for responding.  Someone else responded stating that the
75-84 Rabbit (gas engine) is the one I want.  They also stated the
Vanagon Wasserboxer uses the same filter.  Maybe this info will help
someone else also.  

Thanks,

Kevin
-------------------
&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if this is exactly the same, but a buddy of
&gt; mine had a problem with his oil filter rubbing his
&gt; exhaust and causing all sorts of problems, and an old
&gt; VW mechanic said that the oil filter off of a Rabbit
&gt; would fit the threads and seal up well, and also is
&gt; longer and more narrow.  He's used this setup for
&gt; about five years.  Unsure of what year Rabbit,
&gt; unfortunately.
