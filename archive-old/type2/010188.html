Message-Id: &lt;199907172034.NAA07280_at_smtp6.jps_dot_net&gt;

Hi fellow bussers,

I acquired a Motorola Alternator to install
in Mary. She has a stock Single port.

I understand that there maybe a problem with interference
with my carb?
 
Anybody know what the exact problem or solution is? 
Is there any other problems I may come across
in the swap?
