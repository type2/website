Subject: [T2] RE: How long should it take for f.i. to start the engine?

I had this problem when I first installed my CDI module. The cause was the
CDI not supplying the CPU with a strong enough tach pulse to trigger the
injectors. The problem was fixed as soon as I installed a circuit that
boosted the tach pulse. If your tach pulse wire has a faulty connection you
could exhibit the same symptoms. It may be worth checking those connections.
This theory assumes you have already ruled out the standard faults, many of
which would cause the same problem of course.
