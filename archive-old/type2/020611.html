The pulley has a notch at 0 deg, 7.5 deg BTDC, and 10 deg BTDC.
With the notches at the top of the pulley, the 0 deg notch is the
leftmost one. Get a string and use it to measure the distance from
the 0 notch to the 10 notch. Now measure off that same distance
from the 10 notch and you are at 20 deg BTDC. Put a mark there
with a pen, liquid paper, or whatever. Now measure the distance
from the 20 mark (that you just made) and you are at 30 deg BTDC.
Put a mark there as well. Measure it all again to make sure it
is right. When you are sure, use the edge of a file to make
yourself a new notch at 30 degrees.

&gt; Thanks to all who helped with my Generator Light problem--it took a
&gt; little
&gt; fumbling with the wires and it stopped lighting up---Have a question
&gt; about
&gt; Total Advance. I have a 71 stock 1600 DP with a 009 Distributor and I
&gt; want to
&gt; set my total advance--How can I do this without a Degree Wheel--I
&gt; believe it
&gt; is supposed to be set at 27 Degrees for my engine---any thoughts?
&gt; thanks--
