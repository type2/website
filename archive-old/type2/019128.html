&gt; Guys:
&gt; 
&gt; As a retired LTC, Armor, I know that the military has been using Halon
&gt; extinguishers for at least 40 years in the automatic fire retardant
&gt; systems in their tanks.  A tank has four crewmembers.  It costs a lot of
&gt; time and money to train new tankers.  Therefore, I suspect that so long
&gt; as you are not breathing Halon directly from the bottle under pressure,
&gt; it should be safe to hose down the engine compartment of your busses
&gt; with the stuff!
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

Breathing smoke can be hazardous to tank drivers and type 2 drivers-
more so than halon, no doubt!
