At the risk of repetition, may I suggest to Pat Callahan that he also check 
that his 'pinging&quot; when going up hills is perhaps due to grease-starved 
cv-joints? You can tell the difference by careful attention to the rate of 
pinging: Is it proportional to engine rpm or to wheel rpm  (e.g. velocity)? 
Check it by shifting gears and returning to the original rpm (if you have a 
tach) or velocity (if you don't) and listen.  Also, my experience with 
pinging in other engines is that you can get them to ping by hitting the 
accelerator while at low speed and high gear on flat terrain, whereas the 
early stages of cv-pinging occurs mainly when the van is put under a very 
heavy load of climbing a hill when burdened with camping equipment (e.g. 
Westfalia), and it only goes away if you tread very lightly on the 
accelertor or not at all.
