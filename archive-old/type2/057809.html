&gt; I would have thought the gaskets you received with heads would be the
&gt; fairly thick gasket that goes between the cylinder and heads, not the thin
&gt; cylinder spacers that go between cylinder and block.  The latter shims
&gt; come in a variety of thicknesses that you can only determine with the
&gt; engine partially assembled, so a head provider could only guess at the
&gt; right dimension.

    No, the people who rebuilt the head know exactly what shims you
need, since they know how much they took off the head. And they also
stamp that info on the head.
