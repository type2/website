Subject: Looking for Legoman! -menogotosoto

I have a pmail message for an old irc acquaintence who called himself
&quot;Legoman.&quot; The email address that I had on record for him
&lt;kmurray_at_cowan_dot_edu.au&gt; bounced.

BTW: me no go to soto----
I had intentions of making it to the Lit and SOTO meets but rain, extensive
&quot;Honey-dues,&quot; and a curiously rattling shroud fan impeller cut the travels
short. Take your umbrellas folks!
