Subject: Death at idle

Hey y'all
My friend Ed asked me if I'd come take a look at his '71.  It's been parked
for a year or so.  He'd go out and run it occasionally and up until a few
months ago would sit and idle happily.

Now it starts, but won't idle.  If you keep blipping the throttle it'll keep
going but will want to die again soon.

Pict 34 carb.  Pertronix in what appears to be the stock original dizzy.
Valves set to spec, timing spot on.

We spent a couple hours in the carb yesterday cleaning and blowing carb
cleaner and fart in a can through every possible orifice (in the carb, the
carb I tell you!) until it was so clean.  Good fuel filter in place,
unfortunately after the fuel pump but probably not a good thing to move it
before considering all the crud we found in the float bowl.

Float itself had about 1/10 of it's insides with liquid.  Don't know what it
was, no holes evident when immersed in a very hot cup of tea.  Replaced the
float with a known good one from one of my spare carbs. Funny thing, those
brown opaque floats don't have any real evident way to adjust fuel level in
the bowl.  I thought maybe it was loading the bowl with fuel and
overenrichening itself at idle but with the good float it still does the
death thing.

Any ideas?  I've run out.

Thanks!

Mad UNcle Dave
