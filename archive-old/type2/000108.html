Subject: Push rod seal leaks
Message-ID: &lt;0.8d2ea5a0.255cde1f_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I've read the archives. RTV and no RTV on PR seals.  I think I have changed 
the PR seals on my freshly-rebuilt '75 1800 4 times. I have still major leaks!

I have a new engine compartment seal in place. I polished the surfaces where 
the seals seat with 400 sand paper--no burrs. I just tonight checked the oil 
pressure relief valve in case it was installed upside down--it wasn't. There 
was some burring on the side of it and I polished it lightly with 600 paper 
and put white grease on it.

Here is the PR seals saga--I think I have this in correct order.

1st set was the original rebuild Viton seals oiled with old PR tubes. They 
leaked.

2nd set was stock seals with high temp RTV as Tom Wilson's book mentions. I 
did not have the case vented, and they leaked.

3rd set was stock seals and new set of PR tubes with a line connected from 
the engine breather to the carb to stop case pressure. They leaked. No nicks 
or pinched places on seals evident.

4th set was Viton seals, plus I ran another line from the left front vent 
fitting on the engine and siamsed it to the carb to eliminate pressure. The 
tubes were carefully twisted in using a wood clutch pilot tool to firmly 
press on the end so they snap in place. They really leak. Tonight I turned up 
the idle to about 2K and ran engine 3 or 4 minutes. Took off the bottom 
plates and there was lots of oil. Oh, I failed to mention taking the heater 
boxes/muffler off to change the seals the last two times. New gaskets each 
time.

I even tried replacing the front (fan) seal since there was oil sucked into 
the fan and the front tin of the engine. The seal looked fine and the new 
seal didn't stop leaks.

I ran a can of carb cleaner thru the breather until the dark gook quit 
running out of it thinking it was clogged.

I have run engine with fan off and checked all the core plugs for leaks or 
weeps--can't see any. I pulled the fan shroud to check oil cooler seals and 
all and they were OK.

What am I missing? Is something still causing case pressure forcing oil out 
the PR seals? I'm despirate enough to try black high temp RTV on these Viton 
seals with appropriate drying time for the RTV to setup.

Help!!! I have sold this bus and the new owner wants to drive it to Indiana. 
I will be home most of Fri and Sat if anyone has time to dialogue online.
