Listees:

I saw a brief &quot;ad/review&quot; of a product called PYRO-PUTTY 2400.  I think
it was in Popular Science.  The blurb sounded good for our beloved
exhaust/heater box systems:

Pyro-Putty 2400 is a new ceramic-metallic sealant and metal repair 
compound that resists temperatures to 2000 degrees F.  The water-based
single-component system repairs cast-iron, steel and stainless steel 
manifolds, headers, pipes and mufflers, sealing cracks and holes up to
3/8 in. wide.  The putty cures at room ttemperature and is machinable and
paintable.  A 16-ounce can of the stuff costs $24.95 from
