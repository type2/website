Subject: slider windows

 
Dave,

I don't know what application this came out of, but it definitly has factory purpose screens. I understand where you're coming from tho, as my '79 deluxe sunroof has no screens. Those sliders are altogether different from these.

I think I got a lecture on this from Karl, once.

Billy

&gt;ok a camper has me confused here...no screens on mine...
