Hi Biill,

The type2 list are a great bunch of guys *most* of the time, it's just that
every happy family jostles elbows now and then.

Don't give up on buses just because some normally sane people knocked heads
out loud on the list.... Visit www.EveryBus_dot_com,
www.geocities_dot_com/BusesByTheFalls, www.busfusion_dot_com, and www.BNNTA_dot_com and
then think it over.

There are MANY great reasons to have a bus, but without this list and the
people I have met through it I wouldn't be driving the bus I have today.

(Which, I am thrilled to say, is pictured on Page 60 of the February 2002 VW
Trends magazine, and Jamie Rivers bus is on Page 61.)

And since it's Friday in the Atlantic Time Zone, I'll take this opportunity
to thank the Admins for the fine effort they put forth that keeps these
wheels greased. YOU ROCK!!!!!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hello All:
&gt; I belong to two lists: This one and BMW digest. I lurked on the BMW list until
&gt; the patience of the listmembers and quality of the responses convinced me they
&gt; could see me through any problem and I took the plunge and bought a used 325i.
&gt; They are knowledgeable, patient and always willing to provide a &quot;cheap&quot;
&gt; alternative.
&gt; After owning several type 1's including a ghia, I thought bus ownership might
&gt; be cool and started lurking on this list. However, the responses on this list
&gt; have frequently ranged from condescending to downright surly. I guess I don't
&gt; understand how a group of &quot;peace loving hippies&quot; (to borrow from a previous
&gt; thread) could have gotten this way, but I will be continuing my search for a
&gt; fun, unique vehicle with a more accepting group of owners.
&gt; Interestingly enough, I would have originally thought the BMW owners would
&gt; have been the more difficult group-live and learn.
&gt; Regards and Happy Motoring,
&gt; Bill

&gt; I agree, even my Dad would never do such a thing. I think everyone on
&gt; both vw lists I am on is getting stressed(full moon?).
&gt; 
&gt; What Tim is tryingto say, is that everyday he deals with people that want
&gt; their cars fixed cheap and he has learned over the years that to keep his
&gt; customers and himself happy, it's gotta be the non cheap way for him.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if there is such a thing as a rebuilt pump for vw fi, but
&gt; nobody seems to have been able to come up with a better &quot;new&quot; alternative
&gt; that I am aware of. It seems to be one of those parts that you just have
&gt; to cough up the bucks for and then go on your way.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the hint about ford truck pumps that are the same as the vw ones
&gt; might work out. If they are the same, I wonder what they sell for against
&gt; the price quoted for the vw ones.....hmmmmmm
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
