&gt;I'm a bit confused.  Went camping this weekend and had the radio 
&gt;going, bus off for about 30 minutes when the radio stopped and the 
&gt;bus wouldn't start.  I thought dead battery strange because I  have 
&gt;run it for 6 hours like that before and never killed it before. Well next 
&gt;morning it starts right up no jumping necessary.  Well go around 

Is your radio wired so you have to turn you ignition key to the &quot;on&quot;
position to listen to it?  If &quot;no&quot; then disregard the rest of this giberish.
But if &quot;yes&quot; then read on.  

When you turn your key on, the coil is powered up.  Depending on if your
points are opened or closed at the time (I can't remember which is the bad
one, opened or closed) you will burn your points and damage your condensor
and posibly burn out your coil.  This is why a lot of folks with buses wire
their radios so they will work without turning on the ignition (also means
you have to remember to turn the radio power off when you leave your bus).

If this is your case, then at very best you need to check and probably
replace your points and condensor.  Worst case is you may have damaged your
coil and will have to replace it as well.  If I ever need to have the
ignition key switched on for more than a few minutes at a time, I unplug the
hot wire going to the coil (wrap it in a rag or it will short out if it
touches your engine!).
