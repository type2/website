Subject: Type II Resources On-Line (pitch in here!)

Frequently asked questions, newbies, and on the other hand people like Josh
Rodgers and Stephen Gutknecht who work VERY hard providing resources that
newbies apparently can't find. Making for pointless list congestion and
very little edification for newbies, who are often ignored or flamed.

I'm thinking of a weekly Friday post something like the Weakly Statz, but
which is nothing but a clickable list of aircooled resources. Dave's
M-codes, Thom's wiring diagrams, Josh's library, Sean's archive, Hoover's
sermons, (Clara, it's time to take the plunge and build a web page for
posterity,) on and on. I know there are already indices on the web but the
thing is to push it into their mailboxes on a regular basis.

Push technology is bad, bad, demand technology is good, good--but as long
as we're living in pushland then let's frigging push useful stuff.

Hooper is not going to set out building it because the streets are already
littered with his broken promises. But if anybody wants to step up to the
plate then PLEASE do.
