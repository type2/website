Subject: Short wife, tall shifting...

--------------0A4E8536ACA53E7AD0420F02



&gt; PS- My wife, a small person, complains about the gears being located in different zip codes, is
&gt; there anything I can do about this?


I know almost nothing about working with the shifter, but I did notice Bus Depot sells this item:


Quick shift plate, reduces gear stick travel:   $2.75    Item number 4501


Maybe email Ron and company and see what it's all about?

FWIW, I bought a shift extender from them awhile back, and both tall me and my short wife think it's
just about the greatest thing ever...
