&lt;&lt; &quot;&quot;If you were going to store your van in an apartment parking lot for six 
months, what would you do to it besides just making sure that it was clean 
inside and the batteries were disconnected?

thx,

A few bars of Irish Spring soap opened inside the Bus and engine compart-
ment will help discourage little critters from taking up housekeeping...
Best bet, tho'...&quot;If&quot; the Bus drives even a little, is to start it up as often
as possible to get it warm and drive it around the parking lot...Even if you
use the same space, park it nose in, then nose out to give the best ap-
pearance that the Bus is in use...Keep it clean so it looks like an &quot;in-use-
vehicle&quot;...There are lots of things to do to a vehicle to store it overwinter,
but most don't apply to sitting in an open parking lot... ;-(
