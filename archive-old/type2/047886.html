Subject: RE: [T2]  Turbo on TypeII- Follow on Question

Well, in all honesty, I was really into Japanese performance before I got
into VWs.  The knowledge I obtained working on 1.5L motors makes me wonder
what it would be like to set up a PRACTICAL turbo system on a bus.  I also
thought about a 30-40 hp shot of nitrous oxide.  Here is the deal:  I am
probably going to build another motor with spare parts in my garage.  Next
summer,  I will swap out my reliable stock motor with this one and
&quot;experiment&quot; with different power adders.  I will let you all know my
findings.  Nitrous oxide might be the extra boost needed for the hills.  Of
course, I really don't think the stock rods can take that much abuse.  The
benefit on N2O is that it is not so much of an &quot;integrated&quot; system like the
turbo, and can be switched on and off according to your needs.  I suppose
you would just switch it on and watch the oil temp : )

It's not difficult to cool 90hp; it's another matter to cool 150.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I found this thread really interesting with regards to the cooling aspect.
&gt; Can anyone out there compare the turbo setup (cooling and powerwise) to
the
&gt; old judson supercharger installation for the 36 and 40 HP motors? I'm
&gt; thinking of the fact that the Judson setups have the marvel oiler as well
&gt; which is said to both lubricate and reduce operating temps.
&gt;
&gt; I realize that this may be more of a vintage bus question but enquiring
&gt; minds want to know....;-) Please P-mail instead if you feel the reply is
not
&gt; appropriate content for the list.
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
