	Well observed George, the hose WAS stressed. The new piece
is a bigger loop but looking at it I suspect a short, straight,
piece is what the factory imagined for this location. The parts
book doesn't even show a piece of flexable hose between the
feed line (113-127-521A or G, part 48, Group 1, illustration 12, 
page 1-50) and the fuel pump inlet (O21-127-025, part 1, same).

	The book gives hose size as 5 X 2.5mm. I make that 3/16 ID, 
3/32 wall thickness, if I can't find metric, right? Of course
I'll look for the right stuff first. The steel fuel pipe is given
as 6mm, which I presume is OD...

	Bill
