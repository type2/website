Subject: External Oil Cooler?

Hi, I'm considering adding an external oil cooler from Bernie Bermann
(shown in ad in vw trends mag), has anyone added on of these to your
engine?  I have a stock 1600cc dp engine &amp; the temp has been going up to
230-240 on trips more than 20 miles.  If anyone has added one of these, how
much did your temp go down &amp; where did you buy it from? (any good/bad
stories about bernie bergmann's products?) This one that I'm thinking about
buying bolts onto the oil pump in front of the engine &amp; also keeps the
factory doghouse.  Any pros/cons about getting this would be greatly
appriciated.

thank you,
Keri
