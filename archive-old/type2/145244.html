Subject: [T2] Caveat Emptor

In years past, before I discovered Ron Salmon and his
Bus Depot, I purchased the majority of my parts off
the Internet from www2.cip1_dot_com.  
   
A don`t buy reference:  My bus requires tinkering. 
This last weekend, while I was tinkering with my T2, I
discovered a rear side marker light was not working. 
!?!?  I purchased a replacement lamp base 3 or 4 years
ago from CIP using their part number
VWC-211-945-351-A.  Basically, the rubber parts on the
lamp base had &quot;melted-down&quot; and all but disappeared. 
Only el-cheapo parts break-down like that.  I don't
recall if the original side marker light base was from
Mexico or Brazil, but I'm sorry I bought it.  A waste
of cash.
   
A generalization I will hazard a guess at is any
RUBBER part from Mexico or Brazil should be an
immedate AVOID.  www2.CIP1_dot_com obviously purchased
Mexican and Brazillian rubber parts.  I am aware of
West Coast Metrics, and have most of my window rubbers
replaced from them.  Their rubber products will last
decades.
   
A do buy reference from CIP:  ACC-C10-7596.  A direct
replacement for our what, 73 to 79 bus headlights? 
Not DOT approved; a European H4 headlight conversion. 
Looks great, casts much more light.  Plug and play. 
Good quality.  Only $24.95 per pair.
   
T2 list.   Your silence will connote agreement!
    
Caveat Emptor.
