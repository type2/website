Subject: Push Rod Tube

Replacement pushrod tube for Type I engines.
J.C. Whitney, the finest name in automotive aftermarket products, such as
electric impact wrenches, and amazing paint clay!
I actually bought one of the blue ones because I had a leak (big one) in a
push rod tube, didn't want to pull the engine.
Caveat, it was not easy to put in, but it did not (does not leak a drop) on
my everyday driver.
