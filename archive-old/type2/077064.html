Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filters



&gt; Hiya Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I've run into a variety of opinions on just where to locate an inline 
fuel 
&gt; filter.  I'm sure you will get a sample of those various viewpoints.  
Here's 
&gt; mine...............
&gt; Locate your fuel filter BEFORE the fuel pump and OUT of the engine 
&gt; compartment.  
&gt; 
&gt; The reasons for this opinion may be self-evident but here they are 
&gt; nonetheless.  Locating the filter before the pump actually makes the 
pump 
&gt; work in favor of keeping the filter connections tight.  The suction 
of the 
&gt; pump helps to insure the connections stay connected.  Of course these 
&gt; connections at the fuel filter should be clamped.  But this position 
still is 
&gt; much preferable (at least from a safety standpoint) than locating the 
filter 
&gt; after the pump.  In this position the pump is working to put pressure 
on 
&gt; those very connections.  This is especially dangerous as the filter 
is 
&gt; located in the engine compartment directly over the engine.

The con to placing the filter before the pump is that the restriction 
of the filter will reduce the absolute pressure in the fuel line and 
possibly cause vapor lock.  I think that this is a good location for a 
filter, but be sure to use a filter with a lot of filtering area (not 
the little plastic wonders you see on VWs) and make it a regular 
maintainance replacement item.  If your bus suddenly gets fuel 
starvation on a warm day, don't forget what you have installed!
