&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have a Porche 914 2.0 litter that I would like to put in my '68.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;have a couple of questions about the installation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1. Do I need a knew tranny? If so what kind?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, Porsche, or at least a 75 or later Type IV

&gt; No, *YOU* will have to do your own research and engineering.

&gt; You test all the combinations and permutations and let us know what you
&gt; find is beste.

Just wanted to set the record straight.  I dont have a 68 van or a porsche
2.0.  Whomever wanted to do this procedure asked for advice, and i offered
a counterpoint to doktor tims advice, but somewhere along the line
attributions got lost.

take care,

Steve
