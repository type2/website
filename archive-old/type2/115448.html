Subject: Re: [T2] I can't get my reverse lights to work

Nik,

If your voltmeter has an ohmmeter as well, then yes, you would touch both 
terminals to see if there is continuity with the transmission in reverse.  
Make sure that the circuit is disconnected from the coil before performing 
this test, or you will damage your meter.  If you have continuity in 
gear(zero ohms) and high to infinite resistance out of reverse, then the 
switch works.  The electrical circuit is like water flowing through a hose.  
The faucet is the + terminal on the coil.  electrons flow from the coil, 
through the fuse, to one side of the switch.  Electricity is either allowed 
to pass through the switch, and out the other terminal, or it's blocked, 
depending on what gear you're in.  When in reverse, electrons flow through 
the switch, and through your backup lights to chassis ground.  If the switch 
works, look farther along the electrical pathway.

I didn't check continuity to the switch- do I just touch both terminals with
my volt meter and if the needle jumps- it's good?
I only cleaned the terminals on the switch, I didn't pull it out and clean
it on the inside.
So far I have gathered that from the switch it goes to a fuse and then the
coil, but where does it split of to go to the lights themselves?&gt;Is there 
anything forward of the transmission switch- anything on the
shifter? Or does the wire just go to the fuse box?

Thanks,

Nik
