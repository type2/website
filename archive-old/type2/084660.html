If the green corrosion has penetrated the crimp and on into the cable, 
that's your problem. Any of the wires hooking up to the starter that have 
corrosion running up into the braid must be replaced. Peel back some of the 
insulation from the terminal and if powdery corrosive residue is present, 
keep cutting back till you find clean copper and splice in another piece of 
the same gage wire and a new terminal. But only on the smaller wires. If 
the main cable from the battery has corrosion creeping into the braid, 
replace it with one gage bigger than stock.  Any splice in that size of 
wire could get too hot from resistance. Check the ground straps, too.

If you can't find Hella terminals for replacements, go to a marine supply 
and get the Anchor brand marine electric terminals. DO NOT buy the $9.95 
Chinese terminal assortments. They are made of cheese and not anything like 
spec quality, no matter what the FLAPS counter/man/woman/it says. They will 
let you down in short order. Same thing for fuzes. The cheap ones are 
plastic bodied and warp. The good ones are made of ceramic and stable.
