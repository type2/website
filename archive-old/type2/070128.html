Subject: I think it worked ;)

Well, since Tobin and Co. left for Inuvik last month, I have been
wandering around the house sulking about missing the trip [this is
highly unusual behaviour for I believe it or not].  I wanted to be up
there shredding tyres and breaking suspensions with the rest of them
;), instead of making the daily 250k commute [scary thing is I have
driven almost as far in the last month...but didn't see anything].

Well i think my blue funk may have paid off!! :)  Last night Liz
suggested that we organise a trip around the Maritimes [New Brunswick,
PEI, Nova Scotia] and Newfoundland...including the Cabot Trail and a
jaunt into Labrador [anyone up for Voisey's Bay?].  It may not be
quite as far North as the Dempster, but there are just as many &quot;bad&quot;
roads available for those that feel the urge, and tonnes of beautiful
scenery.

So before I hold Liz to this outburst and dive into 12 months of
organising, I would like to take a straw poll of how many air and
waterheads out there would be interested in doing the east coast next
year?  If I can find a volunteer in NC or Maryland, we could even
start further south and come all the up and around....

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
