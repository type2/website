Hi again,

I'd just like to thank everyone for the many helpful responses I've received
off-list. FWIW, we will be removing the axles, and towing the bus from the
front, the way God intended. ;^)

Anyone who needs a couple hundred pounds of crusty, brittle,  salt-infused
bondo  (At least that much, maybe more) can come and see me in a few weeks.
My 73 westy won't be needing it anymore.

THIS LIST IS GREAT, ALL PRAISE TO THE LIST!!!

&gt; Subject: Long distance Towing
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Due to the incredible generosity of a list-member, I'm planning on towing a
&gt; 1979 van from NH to Toronto (approx. 700 miles) next weekend. I'll be using
&gt; a tow dolly  to pull it back, should be a nice slow, easy cruise.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice on route recommendations (What to avoid, what NOT to miss) would
&gt; be appreciated. I'm planning on travelling the Niagra - Buffalo - Syracuse -
&gt; Albany route, then SE to New Hampshire.
&gt; 
&gt; The van in question has no transmission, but the axles are still in place.
&gt; The owner has heard that moving the van without the transmission may damage
&gt; the wheel bearings. Is that so?
&gt; 
&gt; If it is,  would there be any problem towing the van with the rear wheels on
&gt; the dolly instead?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,  
&gt;
