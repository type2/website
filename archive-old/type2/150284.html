Subject: Re: [T2] How deep is back hatch?

Hi Mark,

Instead of mounting the speakers in the rear hatch, I'd recommend  
putting them up on the valance that covers the hatch springs. There  
is plenty of room for 4&quot;x9&quot; speakers there and they will be a lot  
easier to hear than if they are installed in the rear hatch.

The upper valance in the pic linked below hides two speakers that  
don't get in the way at all.
