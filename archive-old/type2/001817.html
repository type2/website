You can go back to a stock dizzy if you like. * Not sure how well a stock
dizzy works on a 1641 engine*
Try setting your 009 dizzy  up correctly first.

With a 009 dizzy, your engine will just barely run set a TDC.
You need to set the timing at 30 degrees ADVANCED at 3200 rpm...........
Additionally, make sure your not running too lean on your 34 pict-3s air
fuel mixture setting.
Are your valves adjusted correctly?  are you  using 92 octane ?
Do you have points or electronic ignition?

Subject: [T2] vacuum vs. 009


&gt; I'll keep this short:
&gt; I have :1641cc unleaded 1971 Bay with 009 dizzy and plugged 34PICT3 carb.
&gt; Have retarded timing as far
&gt; as TDC without losing pinging _at_ high revs in 3rd/4th under load. Cannot
&gt; retard further as bus fails to pull away properly lurching like mad.
&gt;
&gt; Will a vacuum advance dizzy cure this problem ( are planning a long trip
&gt; soon will family in bus and plenty of hills on the way )?
&gt; Is there a specific vacuum dizzy for the 71 year.....if not, did they get
&gt; better with advancing years, should I get a later/new one?
&gt; All help on this subject appreciated, I just gotta lose that pinging.
