&gt; is this stuff going on the NEATO page?  that would be great!!!
&gt; did you catch that UX was delivered to Seattle?

May be.  Could be.  Might be...eventually.  I reason that (after
an appropriate publication in OBR) it will end up on the NEATO
page.  Got UX, thanks.

&gt; according to my vw numbers,

&gt; last bus in april 65   - 215 146 424
&gt; last bus in may 65   - 215 161 145

You show me your numbers and I'll show you mine.  Actually, Dave
Easterwood has most of the details.  I'm just helping out where I
can.

&gt; craigs bus is    -           *265148182*

&gt; so these numbers do suggest an early may date,   not april 6 as
&gt; the tag says.

We continue to see conflicting data.  Most of the people who
submitted forms for the Old Bus Registry were not very clear on
the meaning of the ID tag.

&gt; just adding my two cents again,  who'll win this pot, or who's
&gt; gonna ante it up?
&gt; clara

Two cents here, two cents there.  It all adds up.

I'm advocating a follow-up sheet/decoding service to all Registry
people.  At first I thought a post card mailer might do the
trick, but I'm not sure now.  (BTW, I don't see any Clara in the
Old Bus Registry.)

Many of the forms submitted are two years old now.  People have
moved.  Buses have traded hands.  I suppose we could mail them
all a form, ask them to write down the information on the tag (or
pencil-rub it) and return the form to NEATO.  I'd be willing to
decipher as much as I can and send them a decoded sheet.

One thing I *have* wondered about is how many of those tags have
changed over the years.  Those that I've seen are held in place
by two small screws and easily removable/switchable.  Nah,
wouldn't happen.
