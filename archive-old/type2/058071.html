after a lot of fixing up and new lifters all round i have a little tap or
slight knock coming from the motor. it could be a lifter but i dont think so.
it doesnt do it when its cold but you can bearly hear it when it gets warm.
especially when idleing. should my motor be dead quiet or is this normal. i
guess ill find out if my tap turns into a big knock on my 2500 miles drive to
jerome. then ill be looking for help........  marty :)
