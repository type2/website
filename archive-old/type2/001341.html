Hello list,

I got a call this evening from a young lady (Nicky) that's having some
problems with her 71 hardtop Westy. Since it turned out she lives about 2
miles from us, we went to help her out. Here's the situation: newly rebuilt
1776 (she did it herself!) that she can't get to start. All the external
stuff is stock, with the exception of the Pertronix 009. It all worked
before she did the rebuild (due to a bad crank). We checked the obvious
stuff first. Fuel pump works, coil tests good. I wasn't sure of a a way to
test the dizzy with the Pertronix, so I put on my spare 009 (known good) and
static timed it first . It appears that the dizzy drive is off by a few
degrees, as the rotor wasn't lining up exactly with the notch on the dizzy
for #1. We checked for TDC when the crank pulley notch is lined up, that was
correct. All we could get it to do was backfire a bit, it never did catch
and run. With the Pertronix, is the dizzy drive being off a few degrees an
major issue, or should we be able to make it run by turning the dizzy
housing? All the other wires etc appear to be in the proper places. My
limited knowledge is stumped, any ideas what else we can check? Also, is
there a way to test the Pertronix other than doing a parts swap? TIA

Jon
