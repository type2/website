Subject: Re: [T2] clutch wear, when to replace?, DP flaps connecting bar
  wanted,  dizzy drive ???

Sounds like your clutch was adjusted too tightly and cooked the throwout bearing. I had problems on a '70 where the cross shaft bushing was worn causing the bearing to contact the pressure plate off center. Cooked them (3 of them) in 5 miles each. Ever pull a Westy with a 40HP Beetle? Long drive home... &lt;grin!&gt; 

Replace the clutch when it slips and you can no longer let the cable out. There are thickness measurements also in the Bentley. I get MAX mileage out of my clutches this way - adjust, adjust, adjust always driving with a lighter foot until it slips under all conditions. &lt;griN!&gt; 

My question: do the grooves in the friction material on the clutch disc indicate wear like the wear bars on a tire? 
My clutches are worn FAR beyond that point when I replace them. 

The bus trying to creep forward: I have noticed it several times on various cars in cold weather. Seems like the tranny oil is so thick that the input shaft has some connection to the rest of the gears. I have never seen one that affected the idle. Check your gland nut bearing (seizing?) and your crank end play. 

Sounds like your dizzy drive maybe 1 tooth off. Remove and reset if you like. No, I don't expect it will hurt anything. I had a Beetle that came to me 180 degrees out. Took a long time to figure that one out (I was a newbie at that point). Removed mine with a #2 pencil, wrote the Muir folks and I'm published in the grab bag... My 2 seconds of fame...
