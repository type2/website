Subject: Re: Are points, condensor, rotor, and cap exchangable

While we're on the subject, I've got questions. I've been looking
around, and I'm getting conflicting information. So, wisely, I'll post
to 900 listmembers for the definitive final word. ;-) Can o' worms time....

I've currently got the 009 distributor. We found the stock 205E (vacuum
advance/retard) in a junkyard and Steve rebuilt it for me. I understand
that when I install the 205E, I will need to replace the distributor cap
-- or not. Perusing the CB Performance catalog tells me yes, because
they show separate P/Ns for 009s and 050, with the 205 using the same
cap/rotor as the 050. HOWEVER, according to Steve, the distributor page
at oldvolkshome_dot_com (which I can't seem to access) says the 205 on a
1973 with a 1700 engine takes the 009 distributor cap. Well, which is
it? I had ordered the 050 cap already -- what happens if you put the
wrong cap on? or rotor? What's the difference?

Also, is it possible to buy replacement units for the vacuum canisters
that go on these distributors? The canister on the first 205 we found
was shot, but fortunately I found another 205E at a yard that had a good
canister. Now I feel bad that I've got a potentially useful 205E going
to waste because it doesn't have a canister. Or, I'd be willing to give
the dizzy to someone who has a good vacuum biscuit hanging around, or
I'll take the canister off your hands if you're sick of having a loose
one (or ones) hanging around. Work out some kinda trade....

Nikki
