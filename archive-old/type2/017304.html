Well, David, they sure look like crap to me.  Makes me wonder what I'd
find if I pulled the heads off my GEX engine.  At least one of 'em is
stamped with both &quot;GEX&quot; and &quot;SIR&quot;, suggesting that it's been through at
least two iterations of &quot;rebuilding&quot;.

We've read about how often cores are rejected as unsuitable for
rebuilding.  Makes you wonder how bad those rejects must be.

This also looks like a real good argument for doing your own heads.

It looks like they busted that chunk out of the valve guide boss while
driving a new guide in.  I think it's incredible that they'd foist that
off on anyone.  That guide is going to overheat and considerably shorten
the life of the valve.

You said that &quot;Mark Stephens claims that these kinds of cracks are not a
problem&quot;.  What do they have to say about the valve guide?

So much for the highly touted Mark Stephens.

Giff
