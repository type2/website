&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; You weren't being serious, were you? The engine only has 82,000 miles on
&gt; it and hasn't been abused or  run without oil pressure. Is there
&gt; anything to my thinking that the proper valve adjustment depends upon
&gt; the other valves being in some state of adjustment that is not too far
&gt; off the mark?

( I wasn't being completely serious, Roland :).
But there is no real good reason to assume that your cam is
flexing or moving sideways under pressure from the valve springs.

&gt;Otherwise why is there such a particular &quot;reverse to
&gt; firing order&quot; sequence of adjusting the valves?

There are several methods and techniques for valve adjustment.
For instance, why is the Zendfolge ( firing order :) referenced as
1-4-3-2, when it could just as easily be 4-3-2-1 ? Perhaps it is
easier to remember 1-2-3-4 when it is time to adjust the valves ?!
Are you using feeler gauges ?  The touch can be entirely subjective,
get the go / no-go set. Are your valve stem tips dished ?
Is anybody interested in discussion of cam profile / base circles,
valve train geometry, or fitting of  hydraulic lifters to solid lifter cams ?!
Dave \X/
