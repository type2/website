&gt;Hey ho,
&gt;         My 2l 1980 bus wasn't well after running out of fuel. Backfires 
&gt; and no idle. I took the carbs off and cleaned them, which cured the 
&gt; backfire, but when trying
&gt;to get the baby to idle, I heard a lot of air wooshing out of the l.h 
&gt;carb. Traced it to a hole (meant to be there) (I put my finger over it - 
&gt;problem cured). Found a little cap
&gt;lying on the tinware underneath. Put the cap in the hole - fits like a 
&gt;glove. Idles beautifully, until it pops out. I've got it held in with a U 
&gt;clamp at the moment. The manual
&gt;makes no reference - How should it be held in?

It should be a press fit, but those things often pop out.  You might be 
able to thread the hole and put in a small plug, but I didn't have that 
option because I was on a long trip, so I pressed the thing back in, 
cleaned the area up and covered it with epoxy.  It lasted until I replaced 
the carb.
