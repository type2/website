Subject: Re: Exhaust Coatings

A long time ago (maybe about 15 years ago) I read an article in Hot VW's
about a process where they bake on some kind of aluminum coating to
exhaust parts.  It was suppossed to greatly reduce the rust-out factor
and help the engine run a little cooler.  I seem to remember that a
person could have a brand new part sent directly to them and they would
alum-o-coat the part and send it to you.  I never had this done, but it
sure seemed like a good idea.
Does anybody know about this process?
