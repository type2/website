Subject: starter wire removal

well, hello  again,

what it takes some of you to do in one day or eight hours or less it has now
taken me much longer.  there have been many breaks in the work.  question
now is do i need to disconnect the wires going to the starter from afore
mentioned starter if i am working with a 75 engine and a 77 auto tranny but
am only dropping the engine?  the starter appears to be in the final drive.
so if i am leaving the final drive attached to the trans and only pulling
the engine does the starter and solenoid stay with the transmission or w/
the engine?  bently says to pull the wires from the starter but the last
model transmission they are refering to is the 75.  not a big deal either
way.  just curios and looking for a little less work.



TIA,
jeremiah
