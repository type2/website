Subject: Re: [T2] I guess it's not wrong after all

&gt; Porsche 901 tranny - has been done several times. Don't lower the rpm's
too
&gt; much though 'cause the cooling fan slows down too and that could overheat
&gt; the engine.....

Yes, I was wondering about that. But maybe you could reduce the pulley
diameter on the generator or alternator a bit to get more turns on that fan
per engine revolution. It couldn't get a lot smaller than it is, I suspect,
but you wouldn't need a lot..What do you think? Jan B
