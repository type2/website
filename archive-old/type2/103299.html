&gt; I'd love, for instance, to have a RPM gauge, an oil temp gauge or similar...

I have several in my 78 and have put them in a pod on top of the
dashboard, looks almost stock.

&gt; I do not know how they work actually! Or where I could by one (even in the
&gt; USA, and have it sent here to Italy).

they are quite simple and inexpensive, almost all of the vendors on this
list sell them, I don't know if any of them would ship to Italy, also 
all that I have seen have non metric markings on them so they would not
show indications that you are used to, but you could make a small scale
that could be taped over the bottom to give you a conversion

&gt; Is it hard to install all those things? Do they require that I drill holes
&gt; in the engine or similar actions? I don't really have the equipment or the
&gt; room to pull the engine... is it something that can be done in a parking
&gt; lot?

most all can be done in a parking lot, best time is during an oil change
for the oil temp/presure gauges.  if you want a sump sender it requires
drilling one hole in the cover plate, although these can be bought
predrilled and just bolted on, the presure sender works in place of the
oil light switch, un screw it and screw in the sender...slightly different
mounting for the upright and type IV engine.

the rest of the guages just wire into existing wires or connections

Good luck
Bob
