Subject: tires

&gt; Nothing will be more functional than the very
high spec stock tires, 185-R14C, Load Range C or
D. If the 14 on the side wall isn't immediately
&gt; followed by a big C, (which stands for
'Commercial', ie sidewalls like on a
&gt; Peterbuilt), it's not spec. These are provided
in either load range C or load range D.

&gt;I was under the impression that the &quot;C&quot; suffix
was a european designation for a reinforced
commercial tire, while the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; ratings
were american load ratings that meant pretty much
the same thing.  I've never seen both
designations on the same tire (which does not
mean that it doesn't exist!)

Yeah, they do exist.  My last set of Cooper
Mastercraft R/D (same as Cooper SRM) were 195/14C
but load range D with a max load of 2000+ lbs. 
The sidewalls were very stiff and the ride and
handling was a VERY VERY DRASTIC improvement over
the passenger all seasons that were on the
vanagon.  

The only thing I disliked about these tires was
the tread was A/S but not all terrain.  They
filled with mud easily.  I really like to drive
in mud or wet grass with a little assurance.  So
now I'm riding the cheap all terrains Liberators
from Wally world in 225/70/14 and a max load of
1600.
