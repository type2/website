Subject: Re: [T2] I think I've made my bus worse...

I follow this process:

First: mechanicals
Second:  ignition
Third:  fuel

I would check the compression, see what you have.  Check the valve gap.  I
have 145 psi on all cylinders, not much different when warm.  I hate to take
out plugs when the engine is hot.

Then, make sure all is connected properly.  Make sure you have the right
wires going to the right spark plugs.  Make sure your point gap is correct.
Make sure your condensor it properly installed.  Make sure your ground strap
in your distributor is not broken.  Make sure your distributor is rotating
when the engine is moving.

At this point, as long as fuel is pumping, even badly tuned carbs will run
somewhat (unless there is a huge vacuum leak somewhere, or maybe a
completely plugged jet, but you have basically 3 carbs (idle, left, right),
if any of them are working your bus will run at least badly).

I have replaced coils, I have used the Autozone coil also.  I have never
convinced myself that any were bad or that any worked better than any others
(new Bosch, really old Bosch, new Autozone, all same).

I do not know enough about your problem to pinpoint your source, and I do
not want to guess, I offer my process for you to use.

Coils are hot when the engine is running, I have seen an IR  photo of a bug
engine once, the coil was just about the hottest thing there.
