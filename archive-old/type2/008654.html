&gt;&gt; in a work vehicle, hauled VW parts all day and still does, that is
&gt;&gt; pushing 250,000 miles. They can and will last.


 Your above mentioned
&gt;parts hauler probably never left the city. Mine was mostly highway,
&gt;pedal-to-the-metal 90% of the time, with a heavily loaded vehicle --- 
that
&gt;just burns up a too-small engine. Any engine that is run full-throttle 
most
&gt;of the time will live a very short life

This is not necessarliy true. The last 3 years have been &quot;around town&quot; 
If you call 30  minute freeway runs as around town. Oly is kinda spread 
out. The other bus I mentioned gained most of its miles fully loaded on 
camping excursions for 20+ years. 2 kids 2 adults, California and back 
every year from Issaquah, and other trips. Not often used until towards 
the end of its life for a daily driver.
