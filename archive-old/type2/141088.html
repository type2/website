JJ,

What I did with the headliner on my '74 was to remove all of the glue and sand
it down to the wood and stain and varnish the existing birch plywood.  No
reason to try and cut an exact repop if you have the original.  If the
original wood is in bad shape, go to a boneyard and get a decent replacement
for staining and varnishing.

&gt; replace the &quot;headliner,&quot; as someone removed all of the vinyl facing on
&gt; the plywood in the back, and covered the front portion with a padded
&gt; fabric headliner that has since fallen down. I'd like to replace it
&gt; all with unfinished birch plywood; can any of you tell me the
&gt; thickness I need?
