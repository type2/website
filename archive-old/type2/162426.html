&gt; Can anyone recommend a product to slip over the exhaust pipe on a T2

&gt; At gas stations, during the winter, I see a black flexible tubing
&gt; that does this.

I've used flexible truck exhaust pipe,  BUT! this can be dangerous, the
systems used in commercial establishments usually also have a fan that
creates a partial vacuum to make sure the exhaust gets out.
