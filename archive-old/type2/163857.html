&gt; I used it once on a 30 ft dump trailer--it was short lived.
&gt; One summer and it was fagged out.

Sounds like you're telling me to steer clear or Nason.

&gt; Just flip out the plastic--worry about paying for the paint later.--: )

Wish it was that easy.  We try to stay away from credit except for the
absolute necessities.  Furthermore, I have to clothe 3 kids for school
very shortly - I'll be saving the plastic for that.

I just called the PPG dealer.  They quoted me $94/gallon for Omni
urethane.  The activator and reducer prices where about the same as
for Nason.  He recommended epoxy as my first application and quoted an
Omni epoxy to match.  Sounds like several have had good experiences
with the PPG products and the paint guy agreed that it would be better
suited to my experience level.  I can't complain about the cost
savings either.  This just may be the route I take.

I appreciate all the guidance...keep it comin'

Thanks,
Ken
