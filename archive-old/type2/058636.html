Subject: Re: Be honest... How fast? - what throttle position?

	Ok, I oversimplified. Our '70 has got a 1600 single port,
pure stock 34 PICT-3 and an extractor-to-bugpack exhaust (regular
heat exchangers). It cruises at an INIDICATED 65 at about half
throttle, maybe a bit more, but plenty of space under the pedal. 
I have NOT calibrated the speedo. I've also got 15 inch rims on
the rear (DPO's doing, not mine) and that should make it a bit
faster than indicated, larger wheels go farther per rpm, right?

	I've never held the throttle flat on the floor long
enough to see how fast it would ultimately go. Its got plenty
of pep at and around the Legal Limit, but you don't get there
by accident and it accelerates like, well, a VW bus. It could
still accelerate when I had it up to 85 mph indicated, but there
cannot have been much left. I don't think 100mph on level ground
is possible, much less a good idea!

	A 'regular' car consumes all of about 20-25hp cruising
at 65, so the stock pre-72 should have plenty of 'poke' up to
and at the US limit. I drove a '77 a long time ago and it would
accelerate smartly through 70mph while going up hill on highway
17, a nice steep, long, climb.
