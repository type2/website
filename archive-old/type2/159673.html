Subject: diff. in caliper hose inlet placement

Symptom- daughter's 75 bus was squeaking in front, so I pulled wheels
and found one pad worn way down as though piston was sticking.  Pulled
it apart and piston is rotated 1/2&quot; over the backing plate stop and not
moving except with extreme force.  Can this do it on its own or did past
mechanic (not me) not check rotation of piston or backing plate for the
&quot;stops&quot; being out?  Decided to replace caliper with one from a pair I'd
bought at BusDepot for the 78 camper, and renew all pads.  Aarrghh, the
hole for the steel line inlet was at the top, close to rotor, not in the
middle &quot;rear&quot; as the old caliper and every one I've ever worked on, with
a steel line about 6&quot; long running from a holding plate on upper ball
joint.  Bus Depot said something about a Girling vs an Ati or Ate-  any
one ever hear of this difference in whatr should be one kind of
caliper?   Jon the mechanic said to get the right ones (I'd have to
remove the mount for the hose from the top ball joint and let it hang
high to work), or get a steel inlet only an inch long?)- so they are
drop shipping it to me as this must be done before Friday.
If it does not get here in time, can one get from FLAPS steel lines that
short to run between the flex hose and the caliper inlet?
