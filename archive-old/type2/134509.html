Subject: Re: [T2] ACCUFIRE electronic ignition

Don asked:


 &gt; switched over to the OE hall-effect Vanagon distributors.
 
 Is there a how-to for that swap? I'm curious... After all, Vanagons
 are plentiful in the junkyards.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why certainly!!   I have been doing this swap on all my buses for the past 8 years.

There is even a post about in the archives:
 http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/050780.html

The parts marked with a ^ I have added today.

What you need:
a 79 Calif bus donor or
a 80-83 Calif Vanagon donor
heatsink w/module
distributor
harness from module to dist. to coil
bosch electronic coil (get one from a Rabbit -they work better then the
Vanagon because of the heat they lived with before-Rabbits have cooler
engine compartments) 

^The coil will have 211 905 115 B on the bottom.
The 68-79 bentley is wring when it says to use 211 905 115 C. The C coil 
is for the later Rabbits with the square connecter on the distributor.

On the harness there are 6 wires coming out of the module plug. About 4&quot;
from the module is a single plug [blackwire] = this wire goes to the positive
side of the coil. About 15&quot; from the plug the harness splits = the 3 wire plug
goes to the dist. Vanagon harness's also have an idle stabilizer module in
series. If you use a Vanagon harness, just connect the two 3-wire plugs
together. The brown wire is ground = it plugs onto the ground terminal at the
top of the case where it's bolted together (if your case doesn't have
this, some Vanagons don't, use any good ground spot on the case). The fifth
wire [green] goes to the negative side of the coil.

^ The weak point of the harness is the 3 wire plug where it connects to the dizzy. 
The insulation cracks and breaks just where the wires enter the molded plug. I have lots 
of distributors and modules w/heatsinks, but I have not been able to find good 
harness's in a while. 

There is a difference in the position of where the two distributors sit - this
one is about 90 degrees off. On top of the dist. where the cap sits is a
notch-this is where the rotor points for #1 to fire. Set your timing mark to
zero and pop off your cap - your rotor should be pointing to this notch. If
it's 180 off turn your crank 360 again-it should line up unless someone put
your dist. drive gear in the wrong position. Pull out your dist. and drop in
the new one - it will only go all the way down in one position (the slot is
offset). Where the rotor is pointing is #1 to fire. You can either leave it
like this and move your plug wires accordingly or reset the position of the
drive gear (preferred way). If you move your drive gear don't loose the
spring on top of it. Be very careful lifting up the drive gear - it turns as
you lift it - you just want to lift it enough to turn it. There is a thrust
washer under it that will fall into the case (ouch). You may have to do this
a couple of times - put dist. in,see where it points,move gear, put dist.in
etc.

^ A very good tool to use to do this are external snap-ring pliers. Not the pointed
ones, I mean the ones that have flat faces and expand out. You remove the spring 
and use the pliers spread on the dog slot: squeeze, lift, turn, and push down. Craftsmen
makes them: P 4735
 
The Vanagon dist.has a dual vacuum unit - if your engine has a dual unit hook
it up the same way as it was = manifold vacuum (vacuum at idle) to the inner
nipple, ported vacuum (vacuum when you open the throttle) to the outer
nipple. Time it the same as the old distributor.

Benefits are:
* never change points again
* timing never changes (as the point rubbing block wears the dwell
changes - when dwell changes the timing changes)
* parts availability (the module and coil are in Rabbits and 4-cyl Audi)
* coil output is always at maximum (dirty points lower coil output).
