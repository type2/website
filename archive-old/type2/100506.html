Subject: ball joints?

Hey everyone!
Finally my bus is on the road! Had a few electrical issues, and found out 
when it went to the shop, that it needed upper, and lower ball joints. Now, 
this bus is from Texas, and has no rust on the undercarriage.  My bus has 
been layed up over there for nearly a week.  Fryday, he was supposed to have 
started work on Fryday.  Here it is wenesday, and they are still not done.  
Supposedley the ball joints took a long time. Although 2 and a half working 
days should have done it.  I am wondering if anyone knows the flat rate on 
this job?  I mean, should these take this long?  Every time I talk with 
them, they tell me it will be done tomorrow.  Getting a little fed up with 
the place. Have done ball joints on domestic cars at a shop I once worked 
at.  Are VW ball joints that much more time consuming?    Any info would be 
helpful.  Thanks.      BG
