&gt;just a flat out no- thing available for anything that old

Now I think that's flat out bull. The most difficult parts I have to 
find, and when found don't inspire confidence because of a high failure 
rate, are nuts and bolts. There are a lot of bad nuts and bolts out 
there, and most of the ones at FLAPS are not the right size. So a dealer 
says he doesn't have an 35mm-8M bolt? Liar, liar.

Mark, feeling self-righteous
