Subject: Westy Window pattern

	The problem of having a pattern for window curtains seems to pop up
every once and a while. If anyone can keep their pattern I will offer my
time to draft them up in CAD if they get me a pattern. Currently don't
have a westy, but sometime I will stumble across one good enough to sell
my Microbus.
