Subject: RE: [T2] 69 Bus master cyilnder resovior

&gt; Seems 68 and 69 are the same, 70 is one year only and 71-79 are the same for
&gt; master cylinders.
&gt;
&gt; Do you mean the resovoir that sits on top of the mastery cylinder or the
&gt; resovoir in the cab where you add brake fluid? If it's the first one I'm not
&gt; sure where you would get it, don't see any on busdepot_dot_com but if it's the
&gt; second I think any little plastic resovoir thing would work as long as you
&gt; get it mounted firmly to somewhere.

the lower reservoir on 68-70 should be similar. some differences in the
tubing but the spacing is the same.

the upper. 68 is one year only. 69 and 70 i think are the same. probably
best to replace any of these as it is hard to find one that isnt cracked
and they are all brittle.
