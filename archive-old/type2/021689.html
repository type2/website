Subject: Firewall removal with engine in.  Can it be done?

Hi folks,

This has been a wonderful summer.  Finally got my bus (1972 Westy,
1700cc dual solex carb)on the road after redoing the heads and rings and
stripping out the interior.  My wife and I took it for our first trip
two days ago and it ran great.

Only problem is it smells like a gas station after filling it up.  I now
know I should have checked the fuel lines and tank 3 months ago when I
had the engine out but hindsight is 20-20.

Can I remove the firewall with the engine in?

How hard would this be to do by myself (one person verses a two person
job)?

How long would it take?

Thanks

Craig
