Subject: Rear Axle Nut Problem.

I am currently putting new brakes all the way around my 77 Westy and have run 
across a problem. I am unable to remove the rear axle nut on the drivers 
side. The one on the passanger side came off without incident. I am using a 
3/4 inch air impact wrench at 120 PSI (6.5 HP , 60 Gal Air Compresor), I have 
also been using penetrating oil like crazy and also a hand held propane torch 
to no avail. Any suggestions out there? or am i doomed to cutting the nut off 
and trying to find a replacement?
