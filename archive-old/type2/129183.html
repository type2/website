Subject: Bus won't start in morning, but starts in evening?

For the last  two days my bus has been unable to start in the morning; 
it will turn over but won't catch at all, despite my fervent prayers. 
 Then, by about 3 or 4 pm, it will start on the first try.  Prior to 
this, it had been getting harder to start, by which I mean it took 
longer for it to catch when I turned the key and ran a little rough, 
almost wanting to stall out at first.  I had attributed this to the very 
damp weather we have been having, but now it is just plain hot here. 
 Guess it is a good thing I don't go into work till 7 pm, but then when 
I get off at 7 am I am screwed!  Any ideas?  Thanks, Beth/78 Bus
