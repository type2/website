There sure is a lot of different variations with the heater control in our vehicles!

Alas, I do not have the fan in my setup (added in '81 I believe) so 
I don't know how this is turned on or to which air circuit it is plumbed.

in response to Weston writing:

&gt; Now, if you also have the fan, exactly what is it meant to do? I've been
&gt; under the impression that it is supposed to act only as a ventilation fan and
&gt; not as a warm air fan. Could that be right?

 The fan as I understand it is primarily designed to boost fresh air. It also 
helps a bit with the warm air. I dont think its very effective at drawing the 
warm air all the way from the heat exchangers. 

By the way...

&gt;From the responses I've read regarding &quot;heater controls&quot; I'd venture to say
this:

The operation of the controls and the routing of the heating vents in our 
vehicles seeem to be about as well understood as say.. the passages and chambers 
in the pyramids. 

.... Hey, where did all those a-maze-ing pyramid passage designers go when they 
stopped makin' those big pointy things??
