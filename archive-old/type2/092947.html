Subject: Re: [T2] So...   Which is the...   *right*   carburator for me?


&gt;Beware of the alfa1750 guy - he sells a lot of Weber and Dellorto carbs 
&gt;but they are just bare carbs (no manifolds, linkage, etc.).  I think he 
&gt;must get them off of wrecked cars in Europe.  No way to know if they will 
&gt;fit properly, not to mention how they are jetted.  Not saying he's 
&gt;defrauding anyone, just make sure you know what you are buying.

But that is all you could use anyhow on a VW - the linkage and manifolds 
are OEM specific.

Of course if you could resell the unused parts then yes - you would be 
better off getting them too.

The Alfa 36mm DRLAs I pulled from the junkyard in Naples had no usable 
parts for my VW project beyond the carbs themselves.
