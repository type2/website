&gt; &gt; the big question is what would have been changed/damaged by the backfire.
&gt; &gt; before backfire (which I caused not engine problem) it ran ok.

&gt; Honestly, I don't know what it would do other than pop off hoses, but
&gt; then again I've never had a backfire.  I do know what you're feelin,
&gt; though, because you just want to know how the backfire could have caused
&gt; the problem.  Unfortunately, you can't guarantee that it is in-fact the
&gt; backfire that is causing the problem...

no I can't but it was the only variable.

&gt; You might want to go through the whole engine tuneup, ignition test
&gt; procedure in the bentley and then go through the whole EFI test
&gt; procedure in the bosch l-jet manual and you might come upon the culprit
&gt; that way - maybe throw in a compression test for good measure.  Then at

my plan for tommorrow and Tue. it's supposed to be nice days here

&gt; least you know you've covered all the basics.  That's why I suggested
&gt; all that stuff.. which a backfire probably wouldn't hurt.  Heck, you
&gt; never know, the pop might have thrown out a connection somewhere, or
&gt; even broken a connection in the AFM.

I swapped in a spare AFM...

&gt; I'd do a complete diagnostic and wire connection cleaning according to
&gt; the manuals and then at least you know everything that is *supposed* to
&gt; work is within spec.  At this point I wouldn't assume anything is in

sort of what I was thinking.  not happy about it though


&gt; spec because it's always those overlooked items that get ya in the end...


always!!  but &quot;what&quot; overlooked thing??

&gt; Good luck!!
