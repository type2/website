Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Head Gasket??

I have seen the following technical bulletin referred to a number of times 
but have never seen any feedback. Has anybody done this? Does it do any 
good? Also, I'm not clear on the details of the connecting rod grooves. 
Does anyone have pictures that clarify them?

 &gt;You should NOT have put head gaskets back in.
 &gt;VW did away with them for a reason and you found out 
why.......    &gt;http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/techbull.html

 &gt; What can cause a head gasket to leak on a type 4 motor?


Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
