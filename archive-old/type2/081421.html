Subject: Re: [T2] What colour green

Here in the USA, 77 Westies came in three solid colors:
P-21 was Pastel White [90D]
P-22 was Chrome Yellow [20A up to 2172079871, 21H above 2172079872]
P-27 was Sage Green [63H]
None were two tone.
Here is a website that may help:

Can anyone out there help me on colour matching?

I've got a 1977 Westfalia/Kombi it is a hideous bright green with a touch of
yellow.

Would anyone know what colour this may be. Also what is the white - so that I
can get the correct aerosols.
