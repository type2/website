Having never honed cylinders before, I was wondering exactly how it was done. Is there a technique which leads to more perfect results?

I'll assume that I have to use a drill that's better than my crappy bent-shaft drill. Every hole I drill with this thing winds up too big. I've never had a better excuse to buy another tool. ;)
