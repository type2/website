Subject: How tight is too tight, new TypeIV starting.

Well I finally got my engine built (2000cc TypeIV in 83 Westfalia with
manual tranny) and installed in the 83 Westfalia, but ! You guessed it
I've got a problem.

The engine is very tight, it rotated just fine as I tightened up the
engine fan and flywheel so I figured it was fairly tight from the
resistance I was feeling. I had to lock the flywheel while applying
torque.

I can put the vehicle in third gear and push it by hand to turn the
engine and adjust the valves and set the initial timing but my starter
gives it about three go-arounds and just gives up. I have a couple of
starters and both basically do the same thing, just a few turns and they
give out.

I've ordered a new starter and solenoid and a pilot bushing for the
bell-housing.

I am assuming that a new starter will be much stronger than the antiques
I've got; but I'm thinking about giving the vehicle a push around the
block and dropping the clutch in gear a few times, ignition off to
loosten things up a bit before I risk burning up a new starter.

Have you ever had real tight engines that required this?

I've rebuilt a lot of small block chevy engines and they often required
new starters.

I've lubed the cylinders and backed the valve setting off to 1.5 turns
from just touching the drained lifters.

I thought about using some &quot;ether&quot; to give it a jolt but thought the
round the block trip would get the oil into the lifters and make the
engine easier to start after I get the new starter.

If this trip round the block brings up oil preassure (got a gauge) I'd go
ahead and turn the ignition on and start it for some minor tuning and
break-in.

I'd like to have your reccomendations as to which way to go.
