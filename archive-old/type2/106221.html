&gt; OK, now I have to ask:  How do you measure decibels???
&gt; 
&gt; I thought a decibels were a measure of the loudness of sound, and that sound
&gt; would be twice as loud with every  X___X  number of decibels increased??
&gt; 
&gt; I need this info so I can know how to measure the 'decibels' on my  air
&gt; cooled VW type 2 HORN..  &lt;&lt;-RBC

Decibels are used for comparing values that differ in magnitude by so much
you needs to compare them logarithmically. It applies to much more than
sound pressure.

Search the web and you'll discover the relationship between dB and volts.
