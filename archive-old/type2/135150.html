Subject: Shameless Plug!

A shameless plug for my wife's greeting card business - hey, it's got
classic cars &amp; buses!

As the holidays approach and your thoughts go back to &quot;what kind of greeting
card do I want to send out this year&quot; and you just don't want to deal with
it. well, have we got a solution for you!

Why not send out a card with an image of your most cherished possession -
no, not your kids - your classic bus.  

Just go to www.woodhillhome_dot_com/ready-to-mail.html to view our current
selection of greeting cards and when you're ready to order, we've now made
it very easy:  you only need to go to www.woodhillhome_dot_com/onlinestore.html
to place your order right here online using the secure services of PayPalR.
So, what are you waiting for?

If you have any questions, you can email us at info_at_woodhillhome_dot_com.
