Subject: Re: [T2] Will missing tin destroy my engine?

&gt;On my newly rebuilt 2 liter engine, the &quot;warm air duct, right rear&quot; was 
&gt;not installed with the tin assembly when the engine was put back into the 
&gt;1976 Bus chassis.  I just discovered this fact.

&lt;snip&gt;

 &gt;The basic question is: Can I run the engine without this &quot;warm air duct,&quot;
 &gt;or will its absence put my newly rebuilt engine at risk of overheating?

That piece of tin is what separates the right cylinder head from the 
alternator.  If you don't have it, there will at a minimum be a lot of 
extra heat getting to your alternator.  Probably other long-term problems 
as well.

&gt;If there is such a risk, what is the magnitude of that risk? Can I start 
&gt;and idle the engine for 10 minutes, to adjust various settings, but not 
&gt;run the vehicle out on the road under load?

Fear not, you are not going to destroy your engine without this piece from 
just starting it and idling it for a few minutes.  Just don't do any long 
interstate cruises until it's replaced.

&gt;I am very unsure of where it goes, from the diagrams. The diagrams don't 
&gt;resemble what I see when I am under the bus.

The pieces S, U, V, and X basically wrap around the edges of the right 
cylinder head.  On the Bus Boys web site, picture the cylinder head between 
these pieces (W is lower, attached to the heat exchanger).

&gt; From the name &quot;warm air duct, right rear&quot; I am guessing that it goes 
&gt; vertically at the passenger side rear of the installed engine, to shut 
&gt; off the space I can see looking up, at the rear of the cooling fins for 
&gt; the rear cylinder on the passenger side. (Cylinder number 2 ?)

I don't think you will be able to see much of this piece from under the 
engine, except perhaps the small tab that wraps down around the edge of the 
head.

&gt;The final question is: Do I have to drop the engine to fit this tin in 
&gt;place? To do it with the engine in place looks like an impossibly tight 
&gt;space to work.

No, you don't have to drop the engine.  You do at a minimum have to remove 
the alternator, and likely also the fan housing (which necessitates removal 
of the heat exchangers also).  Remove the alternator first - this piece 
belongs directly in front (FIF) of the alternator.  If you can't wiggle it 
in there, you will have to remove the fan housing also.  At that point 
though, the piece should just slide in.
