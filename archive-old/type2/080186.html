Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal


One trick I was told to use while trying to get my front and rear shift
rods apart was to heat it up hot and then get it cold real quick.  I did
this a few times in a row and the two seperated beautifully.

I used a propane torch and a rag soaked in a bucket of ice water.  I had
previously tried just heat and it didn't work...

Best of luck!

IF you have enough for vice grips you can probably DIY. Lots of Liquid
Wrench, tap a lot, heat, don't twist too hard. Then it MIGHT come out.
Ian, who's actually done it.
