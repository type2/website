volks- I've got the off-white square thing that runs along the back of
the bus to cover up the hinges for the back door.  It's perfect except
for two small pieces have broken off, but I've got them and you can glue
them back on. 
I've also got the AM/FM radio from my bus. It has three wires- power,
antenna and speaker. It works perfectly, and I'm replacing it with a cd
player so my son can listen to children's cds on our trips in the bus.
I live in South Jersey, right outside of Philadelphia. Make me some
offers.
