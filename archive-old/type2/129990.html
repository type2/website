&gt;Do these seem reasonable?
&gt;Has anyone gotten a better deal with another carrier or are there any tricks out there?  i.e. &quot;motorhome insurance&quot; ?

I don't know how they'd be rate-wise, but maybe check with 21st Century; they were
cheaper than the company I'd had before.  I've heard about, but never checked into,
insuring through the Good Sam club, since the Westies/Rivieras/other campers can
