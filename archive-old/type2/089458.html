Subject: Re: [T2] Long shot, but here goes!

The key to the dizzy part number you are looking for is the vacuum unit that
is supposed to be on it. Short Bosch number 07 092. This unit has 2-5deg Adv,
11-13deg Retard. The 2-5 advance is what sets it aside as being for a bus. You
can raise your sites and get another dizzy that will meet the centrifugal
specs of 12-16 _at_ 2200, 22-25 _at_ 3800 by looking for these additional numbers:
043 905 205A, 113 905 205AA, 113 905 205P, or a real close 021 905 205E [yes,
this is a 72 1700 dizzy...]
Using one of these, all you need to do is find the correct 07 092 vacuum unit.
This unit will have 853 on the arm. The long Bosch number is 1 237 121 853.
Good luck!


&gt; I've got a perfectly good .009 distributor I will trade for a stock dual vac
&gt; distributor for my 71 Bus.  OK, I'll trade you TWO .009's for the stock vac
&gt; dizzy, or I'll pay you cash for a dizzy with one of the following part
&gt; numbers:
&gt; VW 211-905-205Q, Bosch 0231 167 055 or 211-905-205S, 0231 180 001 &gt;
&gt; 043-905-205D, 0231 176 033
&gt; Can Use: VW 043-905-205D, Bosch 0231 176 033, 113-905-205AH, 0231 167 070.
&gt; Go ahead, MAKE MY DAY and tell me you've got one of these for me.
