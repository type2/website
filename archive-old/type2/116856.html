Subject: Re: [T2] Motor options on a '71

&gt;What motor came stock in a '71 Deluxe? It has a 1600 in it and I am not 
&gt;sure
&gt;how to tell if it is SP or DP.

It came with a 1600 Dual port with a doghouse cooler. You can tell whether 
it is a signle or dual port by looking at the intake manfold (the pipe that 
connects to the heads and the carb. A sinle port has one port going to the 
head where a dual port has two.
