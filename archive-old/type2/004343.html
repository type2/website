&gt; Surely a similar scheme applies in the US? I can't see how it would
&gt;be safe to license someone to drive a car with a manual gearbox
&gt;without verifying that they can carry out a hill start.

You'd be appalled at how little is required of US children learning and
getting licensed to drive.  Nearly everywhere standard transmissions aren't
even offered as an option in 'driver's ed'.  Parallel parking is often not
tested.  Don't get me rolling on this...

I made it simple with my daughter:  she started shifting for me, from the
driver's seat, when she was about 7, and we spent many an hour in our own
driver's school (an empty local university parking lot on Sunday afternoons)
long before her required driver's ed classes.  Plain and simple, if she
couldn't drive the H*nda (stick shift), she couldn't drive.  She's since
taught many of her friends to drive a stick.   She knows the parking brake
trick on hills, but my wife won't use it.  She just feathers the clutch
while waiting out the light.  I try not to audibly grind my teeth.  A lovely
woman, but I'm glad we live in the flat midwest sometimes.

OK, enough non-bus ranting.  But the above is why I'm so content with my
daughter driving the bus.  Long live that extra pedal on the left.
