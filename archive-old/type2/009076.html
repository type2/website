List,
I promise - this IS the last post from me on this thread.
I read an archive message that taught me how to install my yet-to-be-acquired
tachometer.  The guy said &quot;..I set redline at 4k and i'm easy on the gas below
2k...&quot;
Is 4000rpm standard 'redline' for the vw engine, or will my february 74 'AW'
engine (Bentley says its an 1800 w/sodium filled valves-but i thought only FI
engines were 1800's??)with the infamous single Weber progressive and 009 combo
do more than that?

Even more basic form: Someone with a tach and a similar setup: If you run
70mph, what's yer tach say?

BTW- I 'm pretty sure i'm running p195 70's all the way-round.
TIA,

Thanx for the responses!
The junkyard it is, then!  Any ideas of one (make/model of car)that fits the
hole next to the speedo?

TIA,

This is a great idea, just make sure that you get one from a 4 cyl car
or truck...
