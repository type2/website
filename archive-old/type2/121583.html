&gt;Does anyone have any familiarity or experience with Palo Alto

&gt;I'm thinking of having the speedo's for my 68 Beetle and 73 Bus
&gt;restored.

I much prefer Palo Alto.

Watch out for Hollywoood Speedo. They ran me around and billed me for the 
privilege. Confirmed by phone, &quot;Can you fix this speedo, make, model, 
year??&quot; NO PROBLEM!! Shipped it to them, they looked it over then shipped 
it back saying WE CAN'T FIX THIS, then billed me $25 plus return shipping. 
Total waste of money for ZERO value received?? In essence, NO PROBLEM was a 
bald faced lie. Anyone might get away with lying to me once. No one get's a 
second chance.
