Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Operating Shaft - 69 Stock

Hello Bob    There was a lot of talk about this and should have something in 
the library or archives   There were some that didnt line up properly causing 
some problems . There are some that the welded area covers the whole outside 
of the arm.  I have noticed that drag racers and some shops use this type and 
it would seem that they should be stronger.  Transform installs this type in 
their rebuilds . I also prefer to use the super clips . these have a spring type 
loop that enables you to lightly wire tye the clip to the crosshaft arm which 
would prevent it from ever falling off .  D&amp;G foriegn parts in tenn. can get 
the stock type if needed  1 800 568 9001  also try some of the tranny shops 
like rancho or transform  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
