Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plug torque?

Don,

Yes, I used to just tighten to crush as well.  I am 6' 4&amp;quot; and have lots of 
hand strength.  I used to be afraid that I was going to strip the plug 
holes out.

Then!  I got tired of finding loose plugs...makes your engine run funny 
and if you leave it alone, it will make the carb start backfiring....I 
once spent almost 3 hours working on an almost new carb that  was 
backfiring...only to find that the cause was a loose spark plug.

Worked on engine belongingto a buddy who is about my size +100lbs and when 
I went to pull his plugs, they were loose....he is a *very* good 
professional mechanic(A&amp;amp;P) and has been working on VW's for almost 20 
years....he went back to using a torque wrench on them as well.

Sooooo...I started using the torque wrench and gritting my teeth while I 
did it cause it seems to be a *lot* more torque than I would usually use.

22lbs might be too much, but someone at the factory decided that was the 
right number....hopefully an engineer!

No more loose or loosening spark plugs.

I'll bet that a lot of folks out there have spark plugs that are &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; 
right now.  Go checkem.

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Bentley says 22ft/lbs. Is that for real? I just put the plugs in and tried
&amp;gt; to torque them to that setting. That's nearly what the heads need to be
&amp;gt; torqued at!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I've got them torqued to that setting now, but it just seems like WAY too
&amp;gt; much.

&amp;gt; I should be able to fire it up tomorrow afternoon!
