Subject: Cylinder 3 Exhaust Burnout Help.

Well, I do believe my third cylinder exhaust valve burned out.  After a recent valve adjustment I noticed it was real tight, about 002., I set it back to .006 and she seemed to run fine.  Today I was driving her and first a slight tapping, then a huge pop, and I was only firing on three Cylinders.  She did get me home though.  I read John Muir and I am pretty sure this is what happened?  Any advice on what to do  or what to inspect as I ready for this repair? 
 
Thanks,
