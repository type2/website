Subject: No 3rd gear?

Hey Guys,

I am so close to completing the restoration on my '74 Micro and I have a
tranny question...

Before dismantling the bus for restoration, I took it for a quick spin aroung
town. The previous owner stated it would not go into 3rd gear!  I tried as
well and the shifter would not move into the third position.  All the other
gears work great and it doesn't pop out on deseleration in 2nd.

My question is could this be a problem in the shifter or linkage?  Or is this
most likely a bad tranny and I should find another to install with the
engine?

Thanks,

Tom
