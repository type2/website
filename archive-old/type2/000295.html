Hi Volks,

Many of you already know my bus (Loaf and Vanagon) website. Over the last
week I have give it a face-lift. The menu is now easier to navigate and many
pages will load faster.

The start-page address is: http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus

Particularly interesting is my rocker-panel welding article
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/rocker.htm
It explains how I started welding without any experience and training. You
could do that too!

Ever wondered what TIA, FLAPS or YMMV means? I have now included a full
dictionary of Internet abbreviations and emoticons
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/vw-afkrt.htm

Let me know what you think of it (good and/or bad). I'm also grateful for
reporting spelling errors etc. English is not my native language!
