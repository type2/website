James,

First, I am NOT a welder, though I have managed to stick things togeter at 
times, using O/A, stick, MIG, and TIG. I, too, have been looking at welders 
for the last couple of months and I'll pass on what I've gleaned from 
conversations with folks who ARE welders.

1. You will not successfully weld body panels with a wire feed welder without 
the gas attachments and bottle. So, that puts the $200 welders (which I have 
found available *everywhere*, like Northern Tools, Sears, Lowes Home Despot) 
out of consideration unless they have the gas option, around $90.00.

2. Most of these low-end welders have only 4 power settings, either via a 
rotary knob or two rocker switches. Real welders say that this isn't enough 
selection, so look for one with 6 or more choices.

3. The one that has been recommended as best of the lot in cheap welders (and 
this from a fellow who has other welders) is the one in JC Whitney for 
$339.00. Bottle extra, though you can rent those.

Well, you can go to Northern Tool and take your chances on the one for $290 
with the gas kit, or spend the extra $50 for a recommended one.

You may make different choices, but I know which one I'm going to get 
:-)
