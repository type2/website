Eric &amp; Barb mentioned about after market relief valve spring that is too
heavy duty for an engine in good shape.  Of the two springs, that is the
longer one and it seems quite stiff.  I just measured the spring out of
my type IV engine and it required 22 lbs of force to compress it about
an inch.  I'll check the spring in question tommorow.

I don't recall the measurement for the springs for the oil relief, but there
is a specific length- bet you could look it up in a manual (idiot? bentley?
other?)   And measure your springs to see if they are correct.  A guy told me
how he had a motor who turned two oil coolers into footballs,    ( he replaced
one, then it happened again!)   then called the PO, who said yeah- he
stretched out the spring to up the oil pressure.   Well, then it had too much
pressure!
