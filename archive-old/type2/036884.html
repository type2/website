&gt; Also, I've got to change my oil there, because that's near the 700
&gt; mile mark.  Is that ok for a long trip, or should I change it more
&gt; often?  What else should I do before my first long trip in my bus?

Dave,

So I take it you just put in a new or rebuilt engine. May I suggest that you
thoroughly test-drive your bus before taking off on such a long journey?  In
particular, there may be problems related to fuel-injection, ignition, or
cooling that may only become apparent after a few hundred miles. BTDT,
twice!...

Sami
