Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

There was that build up articles in
&gt; one of the VW mags at the end of the year, anyone 
remember that buildup
&gt; being a good design?
&gt;

&gt; 

In the Augsut 2001 isssue of Hot VW's they featured the 
rebuild of a big bore/high compression 1835 that had 
been poorly built, resulting in burnt #3 exhaust valve 
shooting through the piston.(the description of the 
condition of  the internals after teardown made me 
shudder)
Whoever actually did the building went with smaller 
cylinders and a stroked crank for 1800cc and lowered the 
compression.
The last time I picked up HVW and leafed through it at 
the grocery store, they had an update that said the bus 
was still going strong. According to the article I read 
last summer, the owner of this bus plannned to use it 
for 100+ daily commutes. I can copy the article and send 
it if you want.
