Subject: Re: [T2] Installing VDO gauges in dash under radio

I did not use the Bus boys plate. I just carefully measured and centered
the guages on that spot under the radio. Tough part is you need a 2 1/16&quot;
hole saw and I could only find 2&quot; and 2 1/8&quot;. It is actually a metric size
but I am not sure where one would buy a metric hole saw other than in
Europe... Use a 2&quot; hole saw and then carefully file out the hole to get the
guage to fit, I used a metal file that was rounded on one side. If you
remove the ashtray and its holder along with your radio it makes the job
easier to get to. Make sure to file down any sharp edges to avoid damaging
wiring.
