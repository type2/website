Subject: Re: [T2] Westy sunvisors

Our old 1968 Campmobile [Westfalia] had a swiveling visor on the driver's
side, and a fixed visor on the passenger side.

Our current Campmobile, a 1970 poptop, has the same arrangement.

In both cases we were/are the 2nd owners of the vehicles, so I'm sure this
is the way they were delivered when new.

Also on both vehicles, it's impossible to swivel the driver's visor all the
way over against the door/window frame because of interference with the
plywood &quot;headliner&quot;.

FWIW.....
