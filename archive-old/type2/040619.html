Backfire

What would cause backfire ONLY when coasting in gear? I have a '71 dual-port
engine, stock with a single, recently rebuilt Solex 34PICT-3 carb. Just had
tune-up, valve adjustment, compression good, no vacuum leaks, etc...
I am new to this all, learning as I go....

  Sounds like a small exhaust leak to me. The muffler to heater box joints
may be the culprit.
Also check the heater box to head joints.
