Subject: RE: [T2] Front Door Seals- glue or not?

Well,
Your sig says NJ.  I used to live in AK so I know one or two things about
vehicles and cold weather.

My worry is that if you don't glue your seals, that the humidity will freeze
and one day your seal may remain sealed to your bus when you open your door.
Or worse yet, though much funnier to witness, half of your door seal may
stick to the bus and the rest stay in the grooves in the door.

As far as having to slam your doors with the new seals, that is pretty
common behaviour for replacement door seals.  Make sure that they are truly
seated in their proper cavity in the door.
