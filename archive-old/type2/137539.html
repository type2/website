&gt;Are you sure that is an 1800?  Have you measured the pistons?
&gt;Just about every real 1800 I have seen has had flat-top pistons [bus and 
&gt;412] or domed pistons [914]. The
&gt;dished pistons are 2.0L. Measure the bore and see if it isn't 94mm.

The 1800 bus pistons I have seen have all had a dish.  Granted it's a much 
shallower dish than the 2L pistons, but still there.  The pistons in the 
picture look like what I'm familiar with, which admittedly is Cofap brand 
(non-original).
