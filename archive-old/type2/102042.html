Subject: Re: [T2] 70 westy-front wheel knock

Hi Folks,

Sometimes I've had knocking/clunking noise come from my front wheels, and 
it's been the brake pads rattling in the caliper.  I'm not sure when VW went 
to discs in front ('70 or '71?), but if you have discs, the noise may be 
nothing more than brake pads.

If the clunking noise increases in tempo as road speed increases, I'd say 
it's a rear CV.  Otherwise, re-check those front bearings.  Will it fall 
apart?  Not if the axle nut is tight.  Is it dangerous?  Maybe -- it 
probably won't pass inspection, and it will eventually lead to replacement 
of other parts as things bang together more.

Hope some of this info helps...

Good luck!
