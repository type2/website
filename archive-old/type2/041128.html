Subject: Re: gray paste in oil sump

i've seen large globs of grey paste in the pans of engines that had STP put
in them. I would guess your grey paste is from oil additives mfg into the
engine oil used. no concern.

the flake is normal. comes from bearings and other parts wear.

&gt; I found a little bit of a deposit in the oil sump of a 1600, a gray-ish
&gt; paste. Magnesium? Tiny little specs of shiny metal could also be seen once
&gt; the paste was spread on a clean rag.
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
