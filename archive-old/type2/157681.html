&gt; Hey,

&gt; The chemical properties of water states, a melting ice cube will stay

Correct.

&gt; Using this property, it should be better not drain the water due the
&gt; thermal mass of the system will maintain the temperature of the cooler
&gt; better and longer.

Not for certain.  You also have to consider the thermal conductivity and
heat convection properties of the water.  The ice may well last longer
without the better heat path afforded by the water.

OTOH, with the cooler drained, the temperature of the air inside the
cooler might be higher than it would be with water in the cooler.

Do I feel an experiment coming on?
