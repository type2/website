Subject: Re: [T2] Splittie profiteering

&gt;&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;&gt;
&gt; It's an inverse bell curve...Most cars follow it. Prices drop as the
&gt; car depreciates (and ages) 'til it hits that point of not being &quot;old&quot;
&gt; but &quot;collectible&quot;; then the prices rise as it gets more and more
&gt; &quot;antiquey&quot;... ;-)
&gt; BTW, most amateur collectors end up with the cars they would
&gt; have bought (if they had the money then) or actually had when
&gt; they were 18-24 years old...

Then - I think the price of the car is at it highest when the 'collectors' 
are between the ages of .... say 45 and 65 ... and many of those people are 
buying cars that were around when they were kids .. I think ... buses will 
go up and up in price .. until they reach a plateau and then prices will 
either drop or level off and not keep up with inflation.

I guess that's no great revelation.
