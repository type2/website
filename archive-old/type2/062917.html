&gt; stock to put in his assessment.  Also, friend may be too strong a
&gt; word...just someone I know.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, his &quot;old van&quot; is apparently a 1957 panel and it's been
&gt; sitting for 10 years.  He describes it as no engine, no door
&gt; handles, no wheels but from California and no cancer.  I'm three
&gt; hours from Milwaukee, have never seen this vehicle, but hate to
&gt; see a '57 go to the crusher.  &quot;The lady&quot; wants $200 for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure I'm up for another &quot;tow from hell&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, &quot;the lady&quot; has a bay-window single cab, probably shot, no
&gt; gates, probably '68-'72.  No known price.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone feeling brave?

BTW, you sound as though you've towed a few of these rigs before. Can 
anyone give me some hints on how you went about it? For example, what 
kind of trailer (or tow bar?), the towing rig, difficulties, etc.

Ok, I've trailered cars before, and even towed them with and without tow 
bars, the worse being the towing of a Hillman, 45 miles, on a 25 foot 
rope, pulling w/ a Ford PU. (A Hillman can hardly stop itself, much less 
a PU).

Did you have trouble w/ crosswinds? Are they a heavy/difficult rig to 
tow? The only experience I've heard about is a guy loading his stuff in 
a '64 Dodge and a '57 van w/ towbar... and heading out on a 2200 mile 
move. He said the van was cheaper than a trailer.
