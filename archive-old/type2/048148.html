Subject: [T2] hope i don't get lynched for this ???

Hi all i was just recently told about this list by a fellow westy owner and
i must say this is amazing, what a great asset to have something like this
available to a vehicle owner.

Anyway what i am writing about is I own a couple 74 westys one redone one
basically a parts job, i absolutely love my camper and was wondering.
I can get my hands on a split window bus that someone has done a butcher job
putting a slide ragtop in ........so here it is can any one tell me if my
poptop off my extra 74 westy would fit on the split window.

Cuz i would love to have a classic split with my double bed camper top.
I know to some of the pureists out there this is unthinkable, but what the
heck if i can take two wrecks and make a nice machine.  :)

thanks
Scott Loucks
