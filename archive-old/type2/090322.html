Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Steering Box Adjustment

&gt; Yes I know I'm not supposed to mess with this (at least that was the
concensus in the archives), but as it is the steering is sometimes ok and
sometimes hits a tight spot where the wheel is very hard to turn (the
center point, I'm assuming).  So I need to adjust it or I'll die.  The
Bently book says to use a special microtorque measurement device or to
have someone who knows how its supposed to feel adjust the peg to the
proper torque/pressure.  Lacking both what should I do? Can someone
describe &quot;how its supposed to feel?&quot;

If the box is getting stiff at random times, that means that you have
something floating around in there.  Adjustment won't help and might hurt.

If the box is adjusted right, you will feel a slight drag when passing the
straight ahead position with the wheels off the ground.  You should feel
no drag at any other position.  Wheel play should be less than an inch
with proper adjustment.

Adjusting the box too tight will kill it.
