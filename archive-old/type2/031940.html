John:

Wilson's book says to start it up, put it up to 2,000 rpm, and leave it 
there for 20 minutes.  Then change the oil.

It's hard to do becuse the engine is usually LOUD and smoky, and your 
heart's in your throat (at least mine was.)  I'd recommend standing at 
the engine compartment and holding the throttle open with your hand.  
That way you can scan for any problems, like leaking fuel lines.

Good luck.
