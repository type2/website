&gt;On my way back down from Independence Pass (12,000ft Continental Divide) on
&gt;Friday, I noticed something disturbing.  Whenever I went around a curve at a
&gt;&quot;spirited&quot; speed (left or right), oil pressure would drop from the usual
&gt;40psi to as low as 5psi.  The oil light would go on (at pressure lower than
&gt;8psi), then turn off as the road straightened and oil pressure climbed back
&gt;up.

Mine does this too.  I would just make sure your oil level is kept near the
&quot;full&quot; mark, and maybe take those turns just a tad slower.  In my bus, it's
very difficult to corner hard enough for the pressure to drop when the oil
level is full.  If you measure with the dipstick handle &quot;loop&quot; up, it will
read lower than with the handle down.  Which way is your dipstick
positioned?
