Subject: electrical connectors for FI engine

I need to find a source of the push-on electrical connectors for the
various switches in an L-Jetronic FI engine. One of mine has cracked and no
longer grips the switch.   I visited my local VW dealer today and was told
that they only take orders for parts on cars newer than 1980.  Can anyone
suggest a source?
Thanks, Jack
