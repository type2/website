&gt;Well, Unka Joel finally hit on the right combination of guilt and shame to
&gt;force me into coming out. Please remove me forever from the ranks of
&gt;&quot;sniveling unknown lurker&quot; and pigeon-hole me as an owner of a '78
&gt;Westfalia. 156k miles, sage (frog armpit) green. His name is &quot;Wally&quot;. Did I
&gt;see another bus named Wally on the list? Maybe they're related?! :-)
&gt;
&gt;I live in Cheyenne, WY which is at the intersection of Interstates 25 and
&gt;80. So, if any of your travels lead you through here and you need roadside
&gt;assistance, advice on where to get a good meal and a beer, doughnuts :-),
&gt;etc., look me up.
&gt;
&gt;I have greatly enjoyed the travel reports from Jack Stafford,
&gt;Bob-(veedubber_at_aol_dot_com), Unka Joel, David Schwarze (sp?) and many others
&gt;who's names elude me currently. And have benefitted from all the tech
&gt;advice and the BTDTs. (Fuel and vent lines replaced recently, thank you.)
