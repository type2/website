  so now thing is how to fix it?
  i am not really sure and from what i have already looked at it looks as if i will need special tools to get this all loose if indeed this is fixable and dont understand why it would have popped off anyways?  i am tottally confused here this is brand new to me...
   
  any help is much appreciated....
  i got to get her home somehow down one tire that cant roll...
  gotta find a solution to driving her with that tire propped up on somethig that will actually rolls.... so theres no pressure or more damge to that tire and such....
   
  checked ratwells site and found some photos but now txt. and looked in beltley with very little to go on?
   
  must try to get this fixed to day or tomorrow my wife is working out of town and i got the only transportation right now....to get our little one back and forth form school...
   
  thanks
   
  peace
