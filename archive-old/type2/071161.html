The Scenic City Volks Folks want to let everyone know about our upcoming 
show. 

FIRST ANNUAL BUG-A-PALUZA
  It will be April 25th,held at  Vw of Chattanooga.Last year we had over a 
thousand  people come through our gates.We gave out over thirty trophies to 
the top show cars. The gate fee is 2-3 can goods or 1 buck or more if you 
would like to donate to a worthy cause, The Chattanooga Food Bank. 
  Venders and Show cars cost $15.00 and all the can goods you can bring. We 
will have a live local band, food and beverages this year. We donated over a 
ton of food and $250.00 dollars in cash last year. We hope to go beyond those 
amounts this year. Hope to see some old faces there along with some new. Feel 
free to call us at home at 423-624-4941 after 5:30 pm M-F and anytime on the 
week end for more information or go to our web site at:
