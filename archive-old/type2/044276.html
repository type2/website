It's an 8mm (13mm socket) bolt.  Several other folks have replied that under 
the air intake distributor it is.  Thank you everyone.  The members of this 
list are a soothing balm on an itchy brain.

 &gt; &gt; Hi all -
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; OK, here goes:  might anyone know where a longish (in the vicinity of 
the
 &gt; &gt; top crankshaft bolts length) bolt w/a three prong ground (?) attachment
 &gt; &gt; might go&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; It is one of the two bolts that attach the engine to the bellhousing, if 
I
 &gt; remember correctly the one on the drivers side.

Mark, is it an M8 or an M10
diameter bolt?  What is the length?  Tho not ironclad, if the nut takes a
13mm socket, then it is probably an M8 (8mm diameter) bolt, but if it
takes a 15 or 17mm socket, then it is more likely to be an M10 (10mm
diameter) bolt.

                            H Steven Dolan
