Interesting.  This subject came up a while ago, and, at the time, I wrote
down the following number for NAPA coil over shocks:

75598

So, if it ain't one, maybe it's the other.  Like to know what you find out.

Does anyone know about shocks for the rear of a bus that people have been
getting from napa, they have a coil spring around them. What is the part
number or price and what to ask for at the counter thanks Dylan
