(I've already posted this elsewhere so sorry if you've already seen this.
Thanks for the replies as well. )
I own a 1979 type 2, twin carb, 2 litre.  There is a pipe on the fuel pump
the function of which I do not understand.  There is no explanation of its
function in the Haynes manual although it is on the picture in the book.
(Page 46). For the purposes of my explanation I shall assume that the cut
off diaphragm is at the top (this is how it is shown in my book although
when mounted in the vehicle it is actually pointing towards the front). The
inlet hose and the outlet hose protrude from the side of the upper part of
the pump.  The mystery (metal)  pipe comes out from the lower part of the
pump, actually from the flange where the lower and upper parts are attached.
(I'm not entirely sure that flange is the right word for what I'm trying to
describe - the wider part of the body basically).  The pipe starts off
running in a direction pretty much parallel to the top-bottom line of the
pump's body.  When it reaches the bottom of the pump it curves round, almost
at a right angle.  According to the picture there is about another 1/2 inch
and then it stops.  That seems about right from what I can tell from my own
investigations.  Over this metal pipe there is a piece of narrow diameter
flexible pipe.  This covers the entire length of the metal pipe and about
another 3 inches on top. This flexible pipe passes through the cover plate
that runs underneath the pushrods and then goes nowhere, so far as I can
see. It merely serves to deposit a fairly small but nevertheless alarming
drip feed of petrol onto the upper side of the cover plate, and, I think,
the top of the heat exchanger. (The heat has, predictably, caused the pipe
to become very brittle). For the life of me I cannot see where it is
supposed to go.  There don't seem to be any bits of pipe waiting to receive
it. If anyone has any ideas I would be very grateful to hear them.  I'm
wondering of it is some sort of breather pipe and some sort of
malfunctioning seal has allowed a small amount of petrol to get into it.
This is mere musing and I need something altogether more scientific.  Please
help.(Does anyone know where I can find a good , well labelled diagram of
the pump)?  Good will, from Bob.
