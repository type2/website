I run a carwash/ detail shop &amp; the main problem I have with armor all is
it is alcohol based. so even though the alcohol give it good cleaning
properties, it dries out your vinyl (in the long run) defeating the
purpose if applying a protectant to it. I think you'll find Black Magic
&amp; black Jack (generally all the clear thick silicone protectants) to be
too high gloss (causing glare on windshield) &amp; &quot;greasy&quot; . those type
protectants are best kept on tires &amp; exterior vinyl &amp; rubber. I
recommend a water base protectant as opposed to an alcohol or solvent
based product for you interior.

    What's the long term downside and do you know of a 
product that cleans/shines like that stuff, but doesn't do the bad
stuff? 
        It is my understanding that armour all does not
have a SPF sun screen additive therefore causing the dash to age more
quickly in direct sunlight. My budy who is a car detailer explained that
the best possible dash cleaner is a product called Black Magic. You can
usually find it at most FLAPS. Dave
