Subject: BA6 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

I forwarded a copy of Jack Reed's (jack_at_nomad.nts.gssc_dot_com)
installation instructions from Steven Johnson
(sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com)
to those who requested them of me rather than snail mailing.  If you
don't get yours for some reason email me or Steven and we'll try again.
Once again you can get them from the WWW archive of vanagon_at_lenti as
well.
