Use a type 3 or Vanagon hatch.  MUCH bigger hole! Roadcow has a T3 one.

&gt; Has anyone tried or know someone who has tried to put a hatch over the engine in one of the earlier bays?  My 72 doesn't and it was suggested I tried this.....now, before I start looking for a lid to put into it...does any have anything to suggest or to take into consideration...?
