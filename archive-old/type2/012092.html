&gt;&quot;Had&quot; is correct :-)  I am back to stock and happy to be there!  There are
&gt;a couple problems with running a large engine on the street.  Fuel mix is
&gt;one but even with proper fuel mix I believe that the cooling capacity of
&gt;the stock system is pressed to the limit by the stock engine. This
&gt;includes the oil cooler, which cools the bottom end, and the fan and
&gt;shroud, which cool the P&amp;C's and the heads.

As I now &quot;have&quot; said engine, and will be tearing it down next week to
see exactly what has/is killing it, we may know more.  It is a certainty
that we never got it running rich enough while Steve owned it.  It is
also a certainty that running a conglomeration of '87 and '90 Digifant
bits meant for a larger (2,1 liter) engine, when adjusted correctly I can
get said engine, evening in it's low compression dying throws to run
cooly and with fair power (though it is so far gone that is pretty
subjective.)

Anyway, I think the T4 has the capability even with stock cooling to
eek out more hp.  2,7 liter, no way in hell without extensive upgrades
like a 911 fan based shroud, and hefty remote oil cooler.  2,2 liter, maybe
given the right FI or carb system and a reasonable CR (which this engine
always did have BTW, hypothetically at least)

Anyway it comes apart next week, we'll see more about just what went
into a MS Stage 2 2,2 liter then, and what is left after 30-35k of lean
running hard miles.  Though I do know others who ran them corectly
mixed on carbs and still only got 40-50k miles.

Modest upgrades, sure, but there is a reason why a big FAT engine costs
$5000 and the MS was only $3000, and I'm not saying that FAT would ever
get you something slightly larger that would run well on the stock FI.

As to the original guy, Reichert is hard as HELL to get ahold of, good luck.
Basically takes getting somebody in Germany to track em down, though
I think Craig A is still going to eventually do a bulk order of new German
1,7 head cores, something that should be of interest to every bus owner
on the list excepting post '79.  The price was conjectured under $150 each
bare, and these are heads that will really see you 150k miles, I'll warrant
that unlikely from ANY REBUILDER in the USA by personal observation
and experience despite what some people may like to dream.  The 1,7
heads can be cut to fit any bus using round port exhausts, but do feature
slightly smaller intake ports though with the 39 and 33 valves probably
will flow as well as a stock FI head, a bit worse than 1,8 heads.

It all comes down to what you want to do, sure build a 2,7 (European
Racing is another US source), but build it right, $5000, and induction
$1000, and you can't use the stock exhaust so toss your heat, then
$1000 for shroud, 911 fan, oil cooler, hell you should have bought a
rebuilt 2.7 911 mill in the first place, or just sold the thing and bought
a nice waterboxer, or better yet a diesel with a GTI conversion.  I intend
to see what modest tradeoff's might be gleaned for a bit less.
