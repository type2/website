Subject: Re: [T2] Hardtop camper question


&gt;Hi, I've been reading the posts on '71 westy interiors.  I have a '69
&gt;hardtop camper that has a stained (darkish) birch wood headliner.  Just
&gt;wondering if all hardtop campers have this, or if this a 'rare' option?  I
&gt;live in minnesota where there aren't many buses, and haven't seen any
&gt;hardtop campers.

I, too, have a birch-like headliner, although mine is not stained dark. I've 
long envied buses with vinyl headliners, until I had to take them out to run 
wires into the rear. It was an awful mess, but vinyl would have been worse 
to take out and put back in.
