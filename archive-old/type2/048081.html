Subject: [T2] Upright motor, leak free exhaust, easy as pie!

hi all,

In my 3 or 4 years of dubbin i have never managed to get one of the
volkswagen donut clamps for upright exhausts to seal for more than a week
or so.  This is most annoying when one goes to turn the heat on, gets
dizzy and the carbon monoxide detector goes off ( i feel anyone that uses
VW heat should have one, i dont know how many times i could have been in
deep doo-doo without it...) then you have to turn of the heat and open
windows etc.  A real bummer.

Now many of you may be preparing to say &quot;if you use a german muffler and
german clamps it will work fine&quot; but i did and was unable to get it to
work. I tried repeatedly using no sealer, sealer and any way i could think
of to do things differently.  You may be a better man than i, but i just
plain gave up on the whole thing, i value not getting asphyxiated more
than i value figuring out what the hell the germans were thinking with
those damn clamps (hitlers revenge?)

I always liked the idea of welding flanges on, but then your heaterboxes
and muffler are a matched set, if one should need a muffler on the road
welding will be neccecary. This may be oaky for you, but i am lazy and
like to use off the shelf parts whenever i can.

A friend had a rather wierd setup, but he swore it didnt leak, and it
looked much sturdier than the stock vw setup and simple to construct so i
inquired as to details, and duplicated this setup on my most recent motor
with but a couple of differences. Unfortunately it may only work with an
aftermarket header system, not a stock bus/bug muffler, though i cannot
say as i have only tried this with a header.

The ingerdients i used:
2 dansk (or original german) heaterboxes
2 1.5 inch muffler clamps
2 slip-in heaterbox repair tubes (picture below)
1 tube of muffler cement (walker acoustiseal is one brand, i used the
autozone stuff)
1 slightly used empi header system (new is fine)

Here is what you do... (heaterboxes can be on or off engine)
first slather some muffler cement on the necked portion of the repair
tube: (you dont want this to leak or come out.)

______     _____Cement goes around here
      \__\/_
            |
            |
       _____|
______/

Now, bang this necked portion into the outlet end of your INTACT heaterbox
(i/e dont cut anything off, like you would have to do if doing a regular
repair...) This will even work with rusty grungy heaterbox tubes as long
as their inner diameter is still relatively okay.

Now you have heaterboxes where their outlet tubes are approximately 1 inch
longer than stock.

test fit the header.  My header had about a 1-1.5 inch flared section that
slid exactly over the heaterbox extension.  The header may seem like it
wont fit quite flush to the heads now that you have extended the tubes on
the boxes, but the headers are very flexible so any small mismatch there
is of no import. they will conform with very slight pressure, at least in
my case they did....

Once i was certain the header fit well, i slathered the extensions with
muffler cement.  Now, i may regret this decision when i go to disassemble
the works, but i have a feeling i can get it free.  i am just sick and
tired of leaks... If you want, leave this out to ease disassembly, it
probably wont leak if you skip this, but i wanted to be sure ;) (other
people have suggested red RTV, but this always turns to chalk from the
heat whenever i try it.)

Now slide your header on and tighten it to the heads... dont forget new
gaskets, and use copper nuts or you will break studs when you go to
disassemble everything in a year or ?

Next put the muffler clamps over the headers and tighten them to clamp the
header tube to the heaterbox etensions. I put mine quite close to the
flared edge of the header tube... but the clamp should be wholly on the
header, not half on the header and half on the heaterbox like stock VW
clamps. Make sure to tighten them good and snug... the heaterbox extension
tubes are very sturdy and wont deform... but the exhaust pipe will (its
thin) what you are trying to do is deform the pipe and then clamp it to
the extension making a very tight leak free fit.

A note, 1.5 inch muffler clamps arent ideal... perfect size would be 1
3/8.  I couldnt find these so i used a thinner gague clamp so it would
bend and conform to the smaller diameter pipe... but if you can find the
slightly smaller clamps that would be better.  The clamps i used took a
13mm/half inch wrench and i got em at a chain muffler replacement
store. Thicker clamps may deform fine too, but i didnt try this.

I have been using this setup for a couple of days now and so far so
good.  My friend has been using this method for years, and he drives
nothing but split busses as his work vehicles (he does deliveries) and on
road trips.  I probably wont ever even attempt to use a donut clamp again,
unless i do a resto and want to use a stock muffler &amp; fastener
setup.

Now i will once again work on heat, and hopefully this time i can use it
:)

take care,

Steve

p.s. i love my &quot;new&quot; used single port, much more low end torque... dont
think i'll be building a dual port for a bus again any time soon.
