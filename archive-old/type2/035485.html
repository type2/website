Subject: Reflections on Havasu

This was my first bus meet and I had a really good time meeting people
I'd only talked to on-line and seeing people again who I'd already met. 

I got hatch sticks from Harvey -- one for H. Steve who'd never heard of
such a thing. Harvey may be hearing much from the east coast contingent
in the near future. I think the hatch sticks are just the coolest idea.

Just as at Joshua Tree, the Bergey's had the coolest campsite -- down by
the water with an awninged alcove, bikes, and a canoe. We stopped by!
But ya'll weren't there. Sorry we missed you.

Southern California events that I know of:

FEBRUARY 19: We're gonna try this H. Steve Dolan, Visiting Dignitary BBQ
again. Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro at 1:00. There is a nominal parking
fee, but plenty of parking, a picnic area, a really neat little marine
museum that kids just love, a playground, and of course, the beach.
Die-hard partiers can come over to my place when it gets dark or we get
kicked off the beach (whichever comes first), and there's room for 6-8
campers in the alley behind my house.

FEBRUARY 27: Us toy drive people (Phil Ruggiero gets all the credit) are
meeting again at Knowlwood in Anaheim Hills and invite anyone else who
would like to show up to do so. Official time is 2:00 - 4:00, but
actually it'll go to &quot;whenever.&quot;

MAY 6 (tentative): Campout at Leo Carrillo State Beach (Pt. Mugu). More
details as I have them.

Nikki
