Subject: Re: [T2] why the transmission jumps at start.

&gt; when takeing off in first the whole bus sounds like it is comeing
apart

This happens when you're taking off from a stop?  Everything shakes?
That's not a problem with your transmission, it's just clutch chatter!
I've haven't experienced it on a VW yet -- and probably never will,
since my Bus never sees stop-and-go driving -- but I've had it happen on
my Subaru.  On the Subie -- and I assume it's the same on a Bus, but
someone correct me if I'm wrong -- the problem is that the flywheel
overheats and deforms ever so slightly.  The cure is to do a clutch job,
and most importantly, to machine the flywheel.  If you find that the
flywheel is seriously warped, replace it.
