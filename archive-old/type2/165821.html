Subject: RE: [T2] Help, Need Driver's Seat (77 Westy)

The seat didn't budge a single millimeter in either
direction (it was nowhere near the lock cam either).

I was fortunate to find a good used seat at a yard
near my house...plus headrests which I didn't have
either.  For $50 the salvaged seat will be a better
restoration frame than the one that's rusted to the
bus anyway.

Thanks all.

&gt; Rick,
&gt; 
&gt; Wait, don't cut it out! Does the seat slide on the
&gt; tracks at all?
&gt; 
&gt; I've had &quot;pros&quot; miss on simpler things than that. 
&gt; 
&gt; If it slides at all, it will come out. There is a
&gt; tiny little spring-loaded
&gt; cam that has to be depressed when sliding it
&gt; forward. I scratched my head
&gt; off and on for a few hours trying to figure out how
&gt; to remove mine. My cam
&gt; was so worn, that it was almost invisible.
