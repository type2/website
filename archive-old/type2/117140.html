Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia goes thru tree

maybe 3m makes the invisible bra in huge sheets then you could just put
that over the whole front end to prevent chips.  i love the look of the PLF
bras for the splits but my experience is the same as yours, sun fading when
dry unevenly if left on and destroying the paint when wet.  best to just
use them for road trips and take them off when you get where your going
which can be a pain to some people.

Richard,

You may want to rethink the whole water test thing with the bra on
if you can avoid it.  I have several friends in various states of
duress due to leaving their bra's on their vehicles during the rainy
season.  Water tends to make them cling to the vehicle and any road
dust that got under the bra turns into an abrasive at that point and
will damage the paint.  I went to a body shop guy I know and his
opinion was that a bra should be used primarily in a dry climate.
Although often there is no way to keep it dry when the rain catches
you while on the road.  Anybody else on this list have any
experiences with bra's of the vehicle variety damaging paint?
