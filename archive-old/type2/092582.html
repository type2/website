Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

Years ago I saw a documentary describing how Goodyear and Firestone bought 
outright the public transports that didn't use tires. It showed pictures 
from the 30's/50's?? of the cars stacked like cord wood in the desert. They 
just penciled out the numbers of unsold tires for the industry and bought 
out the competition for far less then the total losses in future sales from 
unsold tires. Of course, GM, Ford and Chrysler all were interested in both 
public and private tired vehicles sales, and if you were GM would you not 
want your tire supplier to be happy?? They just were not into track work 
and industrial electric so they bought and mothballed the iron wheeled 
public transport industry.

Indeed, public transport is very much more efficient for moving people than 
2 cars for everybody. But in this case efficient means lost sales to the 
capitalist for their less efficient solution. Big software companies do the 
same thing now. AutoDesk had to buy and kill Gerneric Cadd. It was just too 
much more efficient than there own higher priced spread, and eating a hole 
in their sales year by year. What price would you pay if you had a 
malignancy, to nip it in the bud?
