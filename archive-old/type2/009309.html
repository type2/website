&gt; Finally got around to doing a compression test on the bus I bought 2
&gt; months ago.
&gt; First Shot:
&gt; #1  120psi
&gt; #2  120psi
&gt; #3  30psi
&gt; #4  102psi
&gt; 
&gt; Added some oil--is 3-in-1 oil OK to use?--to cylinders 3 and 4.

I'd use something a bit heavier, like motor oil.

&gt; Second shot:
&gt; #3  35psi
&gt; #4  115psi
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody expalin to me what is likely going on and the reccomended
&gt; solution for cylinder #3?

Since the compression didn't go up with the addition of the oil, the
problem is likely to be in the valves.  I take it the valves are
properly adjusted and opening and closing properly.

If the compression had gone up, the problem would have been in the
rings.

In any case, it's teardown time!
