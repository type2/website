Hi Mark, after I built the drive train it took 2 days to install it, piece
of cake. Kit comes with everything you need, front of tranny has an adaptor
which bolts in stock location by torsion tubes, the rear adaptor motor
mount bolts to the stock location , right and left of engine and the stock
bus axles bolt to a round adaptor that bolts right up to the differential,
it even comes with wire harness and all the hardware for a true turn key
job, the kit costs around 600.00 and the only fabrication is squaring up
the engine compartment, remenber were talking 110 hp , never having to
adjust you lifters again  ( hydrallic )
and dual carbs, also you choice of automatic or stick tranny.......BIG
difference!!!!!!!!
call Clarks corvair in shellburne falls mass at (413) 625-9776 the kit is
called the transvair kit, buy there cataloge, it has every single part you
could ever whant for corvairs including engine etc.
 
                                                 talk to you later....Keith

&gt; Hi Keith,
&gt; 
&gt; I saw your message on the type II list and wonder:
&gt; 
&gt; How long did it take to do the conversion?
&gt; Was any fabrication necessary?
&gt; Where do you buy the kit from &amp; how much does it cost?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
&gt;
