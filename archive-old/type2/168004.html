&gt; With all of the latest reports of products from china INTENTIONALLY 
&gt; containing poisons, lead paint, etc. etc. I have begun to check the &quot;Made In&quot; labels 
&gt; more closely. Before it didn't atter much, but now if it goes in my mouth or 
&gt; my life/safety/reputaton depends on it, it doesn't come from china.
&gt; 
&gt; 
   With Chinese (or any other industrializing country) factories, it's not so 
much INTENTIONALLY
adding harmful ingredients (or leaving out necessary ones) but part of a 
larger picture. The
multi-national corporations that contract for these products have one 
criteria - the bottom
line. Every 90 days a publicly owned corporation has to not only show a 
profit for its share-
holders, it also has to show growth. Somethin's gotta give...and the consumer 
ends up payin'
the shareholders for investing in the corporation. 
   BTW, you might check to see who is lobbying hard to keep &quot;country of 
origin&quot; labels off
products sold in the USA...It's not China, but American meat, produce and 
grocery lobbies...;-(
