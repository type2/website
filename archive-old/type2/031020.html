ah but with an auto tranny you can remove it without pulling the engine.  

the auto tranny will hang down enough to get the bugger out.

I hang a &quot;come along&quot; across the frame member under the joint between the
tranny and engine.

remove the rear support bar.  
check fuel lines, wiring etc for enough slack, doesn't need much I do not
have to remove any of mine.
remove the two bolts on the yoke above the tranny/engine joint
slowly lower the come along until the rear end clears enough to pull the
fan housing enough to get the oil pump out.  nothing has to come all the
way off.

have changed a head that way once (would have probably been easier to
remove the engine on that one)


&gt; o-ring and gasket, put it back together and try it again. I wish we could 
&gt; fire it up on the bench, but with an auto tranny this is not very 

why not?? 

the hard part is getting it started, but you could swap on a flywheel for
starting if that is the only problem.  but just bolt on the torque
converter for starting is easiest. it'll sling a little tranny fluid but
not much.
