Subject: Re: [T2] Eastern NC Junkyards

Where about in Hickory for the T2's yard?  Didn't some post some time ago
about one up near Jefferson (Boone area, not sure if town is right) that had
a Singlecab and a couple of Buses.

There's suppose to be a guy north of Wilmington that has some Buses.  I've
never been able to find that one though.
