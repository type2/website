Sorry, I'm unable to quote original.

Had similar problems in my 71 and it turned out to be the emergency/turn flasher. 
It's a brainiac device and failure seems to take out the whole rear-lights neighborhood.

On a 1971, that little devil sits up behind the 
fusebox and is hard as hell to get to. I had to remove the fuse strip and the air vent 
beneath it.

First, I disconnected the battery, of course. 

The relay itself is perched up-side down and there was some water getting into mine. 
In fact, it was about 3/4 full of water when I removed it.

Bought a new one for a few bucks and rather than go crazy finding the mysterious 
sometimes-leak, I just used some clear silicon and waterproofed the relay.

No problems since, and the bus has been plenty wet.

HTH,
