Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

&gt; check the libary on GEX    worse motors in the world

Okay, I've been lurking on this subject long enough! I bought a spare motor 
from a friend some time ago. It's a GEX! It was in a bus that made it from 
Pennsylvania to California just fine, but was retired on arrival because 
they couldn't get a California license for it. Had been converted from FI to 
Weber Progressive.

Now that the motor in my 72 is on its last legs, it's about time to install 
the GEX. But, just about this time, I join type2, and lo and behold, 
everyone says it's no good! So what's the scoop? I checked the library as 
suggested, but could find no article on GEX. What could go wrong? Poor 
metals failing prematurely?

Thanks,

John
