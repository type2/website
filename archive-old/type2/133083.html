Subject: Re: [T2] How do I clean varnished tank?

Dean,

Don't even think twice.  Take it to the radiator shop...it almost doesn't 
matter how much it costs.

I soaked mine in paint thinner and other evil things for almost a 
month...it really didn't help.

See picture #12 here   http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

8 years with a full tank.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Sunshine, a 1969 Nuensitzer and my latest rescue, must have been parked with 
&gt; nearly a full tank of gas.  Now, 10 years later, the tank has that varnish 
&gt; smell and although there isn't any fluid in the tank, it's heavy.  So I'm 
&gt; sure I have at least an inch thick layer of this stuff in the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; I did call a radiator shop about tanking it, but he didn't seem too anxious 
&gt; once he found out how long it had set up. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ideas anyone? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
