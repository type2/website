Subject: Re: [T2] is my mechanic full of it?  (hot start/cold start
  problem)

&gt; P.S.  Does an auto transmission starter have an external bushing?  I can't seem to find a place for one, nor
did one appear when I removed the starter for servicing the first time...

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

No bushing on an automatic starter. It is a self-supporting starter. SR17X
That starter can be used on any 12V bug or bus, manual or auto trans, EXCEPT the 76-79 2.0L bus with the 228mm
flywheel.

Weird...... this starter question JUST came up less than a month ago......I even replied with pics of all the
different styles of starters. I believe Jamie replied with a pic of all 3 starters in a row! I guess we need
to add starters to the FART list......
