&gt; I (being the dummy that I am) purchased off of a certain auction site a disc

&gt; To my dismay, this CD does have good parts breakdowns, BUT when you click on
&gt; certain parts they will come back as unknown of not available. SO my question
&gt; is, is there anywhere on the net where you can buy/look at a TRUE parts list?

I don't think so. As the software gets updated the info is made obsolete
unfortunately. You need the latest version to save yourself an unnecessary
trip down to the VW dealer parts dept and the oldest version possible handy
to get the numbers you need to search another supplier.
