Subject: Re: [T2] Re: exhaust stud dilemma

I had several headstuds pull (PO overtorqued them - if 15 lbs is good then 
75 lbs must be better - right?) and I had to redrill them to install larger 
studs (aka small block Chevy studs - &lt;grin&gt;!).

Be sure you don't go too far. There are some cheap little metal rings that 
you can buy that ride on the bit and limit how deep you can drill. I did 
not use them but I was lucky.


&gt;If you're gonna do that, use the shortest bit you can find and drop it
&gt;back in the chuck. I've got a Portalign frame (Sears carries it as
&gt;Craftsman) that turns a hand drill into a portable drill press. Gives
&gt;you a wide 'footprint' to keep the bit perpendicular to the stud. It's
&gt;usually the slight movement off, that snaps the bit and leaves a
&gt;bit point in the broken stud...
