Subject: '64: Brake Line Questions, Progess Update

I replaced the four rubber brakelines over the weekend, 
and in the process eliminated three brake fluid leaks.
Now I find there is also a leak at the tee-junction in the 
rear, where the single line running back splits to the 
left and right. 

Working alone, I could not identify the actual leak, but tonight I'll
try to get a friend to come over and pump the brakes while I  
watch. Meanwhile, two questions: 

(1)Is there a typical failure mode here? The steel line itself,
or the fitting on the end, which maybe I could just clean up? Should I
suspect the tee fitting? Do they crack or anything? 

(2) If it is not the tee, it is one of the three steel lines. From the
catalogs, it looks like you buy lines cut to length, and the tool
to bend them with. If one is bad, I'd be tempted to replace them all.
Externally, they are pretty rusty. Anyone gone through this process, and
have any advice?

Meanwhile, I got the cylinders painted up ala Hoover this weekend, and
will give them the Bon-Ami scrub sometime this week after work. All the
list traffic on engine stands resulted in an offer from Steve Dolan to
borrow his, which was gladly accepted. RIMCO expects to ship my case,
crank, rods and heads today or tomorrow. 

Later,

Tom F.
