Subject: [T2] 3 things around the turn signal

having spent this week tinkering with the turn signal mechanism i found
three peculiar things:
1) there was an itchy/scratchy noise during turning which i found to be a
partial removal of the gold tape beneath the cancellation ring. i had a
donor ring on hand, but i'm not excited to use it. the tape was probably
removed due to a hole worn through the spring-like copper boomerang that is
riveted to the turn signal guts. i need help for a fix. i rather not
cannabalize a good turn signal for the copper piece. not knowing what
purpose this copper serves, it is okay to replicate and surgically
glue-graft a metal over the hole on this .... boomerang?

2) in the past my windshield reservoir could be pumped with 43 ponds of
air. recently, anything over 15 pounds causes the steering column to weep
water. seems odd, and not urgent, but i was wondering if anybody had that
wierdness?

3) on the plastic housing that attaches to the dash there is a hole on the
seat side near the driver's left knee. there's a stub of something in
there, but what i dunno.
