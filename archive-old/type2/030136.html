&gt; I looked at Haynes and Bentley this morning, and I think my points have the 
&gt; grey covering from being closed too much.
&gt; 
&gt; And from what I could see, the points were/are not flat against each other 
&gt; since the gap I do see appears (oh so very slightly) not an even gap; when 
&gt; opened, one edge of the set of points are closer than another edge.

That's why you set by dwell, not gap.  Dwell tells you what the coil is
seeing, gap is just there to get the engine started.

&gt; For the first time do-it-yourselfer, this is NOT as easy as I would like it 
&gt; to be.  I. e.; Mike Benthin said to rotate the nut on the alternator CLOCK 
&gt; WISE.  The Haynes says the rotation of the rotor is CLOCK WISE.  I think, 
&gt; but I am NOT sure, that this is incongruous.


No, that's the way it is as I recall.

&gt; ALso, is it just as easy to 
&gt; replace the points, as long as I am going to set the dwell  (SURE, you all 
&gt; say!!  But remember, this is the first time I am doing this.   Do I have the 
&gt; courage to actually pull the points and set the dwell in one step?  The 
&gt; points were (professionally) replaced last summer, but the previous points 
&gt; had been in the vehicle 4-5 or more years, with over 40K miles on them.  PO 
&gt; kept meticulous records, better than me!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Anxiety sets in when I am trying to make sure the little foot is at the TOP 
&gt; of a lobe.  Is it really at the top, or should I tweak-twist the alternator 
&gt; nut one way or the other?  (I have an extra distributor, and I was 
&gt; practicing at my bench.  Somehow, the plastic foot on the set of points 
&gt; BROKE!!  ///It wasn't my fault, Mom, Bobby made me do it!///  Has anyone 
&gt; else seen the little plastic foot break??  No, just ME!!  Anxiety.)
&gt; 
&gt; I have an NOS Bosch blister pack, with rotor, points and condenser.  Should 
&gt; I replace the condenser too??  Heck, the blister pack is only 7 to 10 bucks, 
&gt; if I can find it again!!

I won't hurt to replace the condensor.  What you do is pop the cap loose
and then pull the rest of the distributor and work on it on the bench.
Much easier to get at things and
if you drop the little screw you just tip it out.  When you're done and
the gap is set you pop the whole thing back in.

Don't be scared of the thing!  It's very simple and easy to work on.
