&gt;I just recently added to my collection of cars with a 1970 safare high-top

I have never seen a Safare that old.  Does yours have the plate at the base of the passenger door?  Below, and in addition to the VW plate?  If so, what is the serial number?  If the plate is not there, and there are no holes drilled, then it is not a Safare.  There were quite a few other highroof conversions in the 68-71 range which have no markings to identify who manufactured them.

&gt;I was wondering what they are worth, how many were produced, what were some
&gt;of the factory options for them, etc.  I have the top that drops down in the
&gt;back for the roof rack.  Any information that you guys have, I would be
&gt;greatful to recieve....

There were roughly 1,000 Safare's produced.  They came from Paramount, California (suburb of LA).  The oldest I have seen is a '71 model, and the newest a '75.  Distinguishing features include a tall closet behind the driver, side-facing bench seats in the rear, electric NorCold refrigerator, sliding windows in the highroof (Adventurewagen used crank-up windows hinged at the top).  They came in blue, yellow, and green with the yellow the most common and green the most rare.  Safares were well-equipped campers but they were short on interior space and build quality.  They are not usually worth as much as an equivalent Westy because they are usually in bad condition.  There is an owners manual at my web site:
