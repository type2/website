Subject: How to Clean Pistons?
References: &lt;199812011329.GAA18954_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

Okay,

Next step is to clean of my pistons, cylinders, and heads that are coated with carbon deposits.  Muir says to scrape with a boyscout knife, I didn't find this to be too fast.  I have a parts cleaner with some neato solvent, but that's not much better.  What does everyone else do?

Thanks again,
Robert
