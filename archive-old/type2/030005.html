&gt; If this is the case, why does a flame light a charge much easier than a
&gt; spark? Flames can easily light A/F ratios of 23:1, and a spark can't do
&gt; that. This is how some Honda engines worked, with 2 combustion chambers, one
&gt; at 14:1 (for spark ignition), and the other at 22:1 which was ignited by the
&gt; already burning 14:1 chamber. (for example).
&gt; 
&gt; The point I was making is that many people think they know why, but even the
&gt; pros are sure EXACTLY how a spark ignites the charge.

The surface area of a spark is very small compared to the surface area of
a flame.  In order to ignite, you have to get three things in close
proximity:  fuel, air, and heat.  With a spark, you have to get fuel and
air both in close proximity (molecular distance) to each other and to the
spark so that you can heat
them to the point where the molecules will rearrange and release energy.
If the mixture is lean, the chances of getting fuel and oxygen in close
proximity goes down, which means that the chances of lighting it with a
tiny spark goes down.  A flame is larger physically, so the chances of it
finding some molecules close enough together to react is greater.

I don't think that this is nearly as difficult a concept as it has been
made out to be.  You just have to think of it on the molecular level.
