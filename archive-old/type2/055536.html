Subject: Re: sump plate step studs?

Scott writ:

OK, so I'm going to put in step studs into my case to compensate for my
&gt; ragged 6mm studs I have now. So, my understanding is that I drill out the
&gt; threaded holes in the case a size larger (7mm?) and then tap to fit an
8mm
&gt; step stud. Right? Now I have to be extra careful to drill at a right
angle

First, assuming that the step studs are standard M8 x 1.25, the correct
drill size is 6.75mm,  which is .266 in American. Miraculously enough, this
is 17/64, which is a fairly common drill size. Since the 6mm threaded holes
are .197 minor diameter, or .236 if totally stripped, the amount of stock
removal is very small, and you would have to try pretty hard to induce a
drill to go in crooked. It's natural tendency is to follow the existing
hole. If you make a conscious effort to hold the drill straight, you should
have no problem. HTH
