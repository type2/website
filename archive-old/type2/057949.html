Subject: Question for Berg engine people

Okay, you folks out there running Berg engines, you've heard the big spiel
on low compression equaling long life. But my 69X88 Berg engine running 6.7
CR produces abysmal gas mileage in the 70 bus--in the order of 13-14 mpg. I
am running a 34 pict 3, 125 main jet, stock exhaust, dual-vac dizzy, etc.

This engine has the &quot;semi-hemi&quot; heads on it, which Berg counsels will
require more total advance and/or leaner jetting to not run over rich. I've
got the 4 extra degrees of total advance cranked in, but it doesn't help.

Anyone out there with a similar setup? What kind of mileage do you get?
what kind of carb are you running? What jetting?
Bob
