Subject: Solar power fridge

Anyone has any experience putting a high performance (Danfoss) 
compressor fridge (ex: Waeco Collmatic) on a camper and using a couple 
of solar pannels to power it?

Danfoss compressor fridges have an average power consumption as low as 
6-18W, depending on volume and freezer size.

Any suggestions for suppliers? (in Europe/in the US)
