To answer your question directly,,,

Bentley  Volkswagen Official Service Manual
Lubrication and Maintenance
CH 9, pg12, 4.2 Manual Transmission and Automatic transmission

Changing Hypoid Oil
1968 and 1969 models only

It is unnecessary to change the hypoid oil on a 1970 and later vehicle,
unless the oil has become contaminated or the temerature change makes it
necessary to use an oil of a different viscosity.
