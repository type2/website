Subject: Rust Panel replacement work needed - Champagne ed '78 -
  Washington DC

I need two panels replaced on my Sage Green daily driver '78.  The right
rear wheel panel [the big one] and the rear valance panel behind the rear
bumper.

I just picked up a '78 champagne that I am stripping and planning to give a
full beauty treatment to, and I don't intend to keep most of the brown
interior.  So I can trade any of the brown stuff, including the front dash
but not the dash panel with the VIN on it, the steering wheel and housing
(you can get the ignition switch with key that matches the four door locks
and those cylinders)

or

the refrigerator/closet, the stove closet, or most of a z-bed.  I am keeping
the AC/DC converter because it is also a battery charger.  I may have
another switch panel, though.

or

the seats and all the brown covers I have

or

front, middle, rear brown carpets

or

[let's talk]

I need to be relatively local to Washington DC, so I could drive my '78 to
your place with the parts, and sleep in it while the work was being done...
