&gt; For those of you who aren't aware, DTM stands for &quot;Down The Middle&quot; and is
&gt; a new fan shrouding that Jake Raby has designed for both type-iv and
&gt; type-i engines.  Looks pretty cool, but a little pricey for me at this
&gt; point.

Actually it was assembled 10 years ago by a man called Joe Locicero who died
and who's son let the business languish. He refused to sell the business to
Jake (it was actually on eBay at one time) so Jake bought it secretly
through a friend to hide the identity of the true buyer.
