Subject: [T2] she won't start, what the heck is going on.....

well after yesterday's backfire explosion my engine has been inoperable.  
the battery is nice and strong, the starter cranks great, i have spark at 
the coil and a good spark at the plugs (put new wires on to replace the old 
rotten ones, thought that might be a problem but didn't help at all...), and 
yesterday i checked the compression on all the cylinders and they were all 
good.  when i crank the engine and go to the back, i can smell some gas, 
which leads me to believe that the pump might be working.  fyi, before i 
bought the bus the PO put a new fuel pump and mass airflow sensor in, so 
both of those things should be ok.

so what can i check?  right now i'm working out of muir's idiot book and an 
old copy of chilton's, and both have virtually nothing to say about the AFC 
system.  still waiting on the bentley in the mail.

this is so frustrating......

mark '78 fi bus.
