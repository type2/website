Subject: Re: [T2] Advice please

&gt;If you are going to accept 250-260 as a normal operating temperature I 
&gt;would advise you not to run a
&gt;multi-viscosty oil but rather a straight-weight SAE40 or 50 weight oil. I
&gt;would also suggest that 250-260 is the maximum temperature you should
&gt;allow the oil to reach.  If it goes higher I would advise slowing down or
&gt;pulling over to allow the engine to cool.

I agree on all of that but suggest a synthetic oil as they are designed to 
handle higher temps. However I agree - fix the problem and not the symptoms.
