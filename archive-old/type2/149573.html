Subject: Parting out/selling a 79 transporter in MD

     I've got a 79 standard fuel injected bus that I've decided to part out, 
or sell less engine and fuel tank if somebody wants it.  It has a clean MD 
title signed by the PO.  It's restorable but there is rust in the sliding 
door track, holes in the wheel wells, and other rust issues but it's really 
not that bad.  I am working on a 73 camper that's less rusty and got it 
mostly for the fuel injected 2 liter motor.  I was originally going to stuff 
the smaller motor out of the 73 in it and sell it as a running bus, but I 
just don't want to fool with it.  SO, if your interested in parts, or the 
entire bus minus the parts I am keeping (Motor complete with all fuel 
injection bits and fuel tank), let me know.
    Everything else is up for grabs.  It's got slider windows, a pretty full 
brown interior with 3/4 (I think) middle seat, full dash, supposedly good 
tranny (I haven't driven it at highway speeds) and is basically complete.  
I'd like to re-coupe some of my cost of the bus and cover the hassle of 
removing parts so I'll be asking for some reasonable sum for everything, 
feel free to add an offer with any parts request.  Unless it's ridiculously 
small I'll probably just go with that.
    Local boys (Marcus, Steve, Barry, et al) can come get their own stuff 
off the bus and of course pay even less with no shipping or hassle fee for 
me having to remove the stuff :-)

    Oh, I have to leave it rolling because I've got a tow-dolly not a flat 
bed.  I think that's it.
