&gt; If you're recovering your seats (or even if you're not, they're
&gt; relatively easy to take apart), you can put heated seat elements in
&gt; yourself:
&gt; I've been considering putting these in my bus.  Vinyl is cold.

those buggers are $200 for both front seats, the bunk warmer that I got
was about $20 or so, not as pretty but I remove them in warmer weather
anyway. also I don't have vinyl seats but the cloth ones
from a vanagon
