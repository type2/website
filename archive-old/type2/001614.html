&gt;   Can anyone tell me the diameter of the bolts that hold on the pan under
&gt;the front of the bus.  You know, the pan under the pedal area

On my '71 Westy the size is M6 x 1.0 pitch, 10mm long.  I just replaced
several of the bolts this weekend.  I suspect that the reason your holes
seem small is because of rust and debris (several of mine had this problem),
but using a 6x1.0 tap should clear them out.  Most of the holes have
welded-on nuts on the back side of the sheetmetal, except the two front
outer ones, which appear to use sheet metal screws. I'm going to J-B weld a
couple of large flange nuts at those locations (easily accessible with the
pan off), so I don't have to keep track of which bolts go where during my
infrequent visits behind the pan. I'm replacing all the bolts with stainless
steel with new washers of the original type (hard to find, I got mine at
McMaster-Carr) so that they will hopefully last another 30 years.
