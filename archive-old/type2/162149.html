Hi all,



The problem persists but now it is more a matter of it taking forever to
catch and fire. The starter kicks it over easily enough. I checked my
points again at they are at 40 and I cannot get it any closer to 50. I
have set it, then my friend set it to what he thought was correct with
the feeler gauge, and both times, it comes out at 40. I have never had a
problem setting them, is it possible my points are burning up and thus
the point gap is getting to big? What else could cause it?



Thanks,



Max

PS - Sorry to hear about the engine Arnaud. It lasted longer than the
first engine I ever built, a rod went through the block about 5 seconds
after starting :(

Richard's suggestion about moving the circlip in a circle is how I make
sure they are seated when I put them together.
