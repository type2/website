I also have an early '76, and before I replaced it, I had the stock 
DVDA distributor.  (I have since replaced it with an ACN SVDA, because 
my original distributor needs a rebuild.)

I found that the engine ran much better with the retard side 
disconnected (and plugged/capped, obviously :-) and the engine timed to 
7.5 BTDC.  (The retard side provides ~12 degrees of retard, so 7.5 BTDC 
is where you end up if it weren't there.)

They did away with the retard later on in '76 anyway.  It was only an 
emissions control mechanism.
