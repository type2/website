Subject: Re: [T2] coleman heater in a bus

&gt; I've been using a Coleman Black Cat for a few years now, and I'd recommend

Another vote here for the Coleman - I have the 'PowerCat'. I use it when I'm
driving, camping and anytime I need a little more heat. I also do alot of yoga
and it's nice to set in the room to bring the temperature up a few degrees.
Overall, the cost of Coleman and the versatility make it a much better option
to a hard-wired furnace in the bus. Or at least, a great stop-gap while you
figure out the furnace!

-Eric
