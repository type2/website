&gt;How about the wheels?  Weren't they also warped?
&gt;
&gt;It's common for steel wheels to be distorted by improper lug tightening,
and
&gt;alloy wheels can be cracked.  If the wheels are warped/distorted your
tires
&gt;will wear unevenly and rapidly.
&gt;
&gt;Do you care to name the &quot;regional chain&quot;?

This happened to the stock 13&quot; alloys (92 Civic VX 51MPG!) which held up
fine. The bolt pattern is very small. In fact they didn't replace the drums
at first because they felt such a small lug circle couldn't possibly affect
the drums. Trouble is the drums are only 8&quot; across.

Someone else mentioned bringing in just the wheels. I had get the tires
from Tire Rack because this place wasn't interested in special ordering the
size I wanted (185/60R13) should have been my first clue. My wife brought
the car in for the service.

Name of the place WAS Tire Palace (maybe that should have been my first
clue :-) )
