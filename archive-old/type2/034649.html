Subject: Re: power loss, idle trouble [1600DP, Solex 30] follow-up

Hi, folks: here's a follow-up, with suggestions from 
listees and some information I meant to include but 
forgot in the original post.  

Bob suggested changing the filter.  I did that, but
forgot to mention it.  Sorry.  My filter's between the 
fuel pump and the carb; I don't have one between the 
fuel tank and the fuel pump.  The old filter didn't 
show any signs of crud, but I'm not sure I'd know what 
it would look like if it were collecting water...?

Karl asked if it might be water in the fuel tank, and 
asked if it had started since I filled the tank.  
Because I was using it only for spradically for a 
couple of weeks, and was gone for ten days in the 
middle of it all, I wasn't paying close attention to 
that. I really don't know if it started with a 
particular fill-up.  After you asked, I checked my 
little book where I write down mileage at fill-ups, 
though, and it doesn't show anything unusual.  Nothing 
that sticks out beyond normal slight winter mileage 
drop.

And Andy suggested tearing down the carb and rebuilding 
it.  That's certainly a possibility [although the 
nearest store with a carb kit, travelling at idle speed 
in 1st gear, is now 4 hours away--I'll have to work on 
that].  I rebuilt it last January, and had it off to 
inspect it in October.  This seems a little soon to be 
at it again, but I'm willing to try about anything now.

I haven't opened up the fuel pump to see if it's 
clogged with something; no one's mentioned that but 
I'll do it tomorrow.  If it is clogged, that would 
suggest there's crud in my tank, which might explain 
why it ran great for 4-5 miles, then started acting up 
again, as the stuff moved around in the tank then 
settled again.  Hm.

Thanks for the suggestions.
