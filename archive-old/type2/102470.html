Subject: Question about the list

I am sorry that this message will not have any real Volkswagen content, but I
have to ask, since you have such a great archiving system, how on earth do you
do this? I have some rare information in the form of books from East Germany,
pertaining to dogs (German Shepherd Dogs, and I would like to make this all
available to readers somehow by putting it all into a searchable archive. Can
you give me any tips, please? This would be a not-for-profit site and
activity. I don't feel right just sitting on all this information when it
could be so helpful to others, and I would gladly scan it all and put it
online if I had a clue how to do it without spending a ton of money on an
internet consultant. Thanks!
