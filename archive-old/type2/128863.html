&gt;On a 76 is the pin on which the gas pedal pivots supposed come out?  My pedal
&gt;has one of the hinge points gaped to the point it can be removed with the pin
&gt;in place, but I suspect this is not right and why my pedal feels floppy.  I
&gt;know that on my 181 the two holes are the same size and the pin is just pushed
&gt;out the side to free the gas pedal.  However, on my 76 bus the pin is so
&gt;rusted I can't tell if is is fixed or not.  I gave it a few good whacks with
&gt;the punch and hammer but it didn't budge.  I don't want to beat too hard until
&gt;I know it's supposed to move.

Use some penetrating oil and knock it out. The pin should go all the way through.
