Subject: Re: [T2] front glass seal

I think the seam is mostly just to help you get it centered. It there is a
top or bottom I didn't know it.   :)

I found that taping the seal once you got it started helped keep it in
place. Then just pull your string through the tape as you go. The tape
pulled out easily after the window was installed. Here are some pics:

Good luck!

Subject: [T2] front glass seal


&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Does the seam on new front glass rubber go on the top or bottom of the
&gt; window?
&gt;
&gt; My old seal was so bad, I couldn't tell.
&gt; BTW, this looks to be a serious job to just get the rubber on the window.
&gt; I've got it &quot;stretching&quot; right now as it was just incredibly hard to get
&gt; on the glass.  I've done bug front windows, no problem, but this one
&gt; requires some *serious* effort!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;
