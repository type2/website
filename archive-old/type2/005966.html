Folks-

I recently posted a query for opinions about my motor-building ideas. As 
you may recall, I seek a reliable power increase in my 2.0 hydraulic FI 
rebuild for our 1982 Westy that I maintain meticulously, but drive like 
I've been pithed.

Thank you to all who responded. Many asked to be informed of &quot;what others 
said&quot; so I figured I would cc: the whole list.

Many folks pointed to MSHP as a source of a COTS solution for a 
High-performance motor that won't blow up in 50k. That is *probably* the 
way I will go. No muss, no fuss. If not, here the rest of the comments, 
congealed for easy digestion:

Folks thought the counterweighted crank to be a great investment. The 
zero-balancing also received good reviews, although someone questioned the 
&quot;extreme&quot; cost of this service. T-Hoff here in sunny Raleigh wants &quot;around 
$125&quot; to zero balance everything that spins or reciprocates, fan and 
flywheel/press plate included). Sounds like a bargain to me.

Front-grill mounted auxiliary oil cooler and thermostat were universally 
applauded. One pointed out mounting an electric, thermostatically 
controlled fan would help in stop &amp; go driving. Smrt...Ooops, I mean smart.

A couple of folks pointed out that while align-boring the type 2/4 case is 
not usually necessary, that these cases are now up in the 200-300+k mileage 
range, and should definitely be checked. Will do.

The NPR 96's received mixed-to-negative reviews, tending to go out of round 
and lose seal. MSHP allegedly has a new 95 and 96mm solution...we'll see. A 
number of folks pointed out that the 2.0 heads have smaller valves, and can 
easily accommodate a modest increase in valve size, without pain. Use 
sodium-filled exhaust valves, (those on a low-sodium diet should substitute 
Mrs. Dash-filled valves). Again, will do.

&quot;No&quot; to the ratio rockers, and no to the piston skirt polish... &quot;Yes&quot; to 
the Melling pump, combustion chamber polish, and three-angle valve job.

Someone also suggested that I find a Bosch FI pro that can install a 
resistor between the head temp sender and the ECU, so as to correct for the 
larger displacement and easier breathing...I'll have to study that idea a 
bit though, as I am a pretty firm believer that the Bosch system is 
designed out of the box to compensate for such... Thoughts?

Also suggested was the Pertronix Electronic Ignition stuff. Sounds like a 
winner to me.

Once again, thanks for all the thoughts and ideas. We were camping in the 
Uwharries over the weekend...up and down hills/log roads, etc...lots of 
time in second gear. I am VERY ready for some more horsepower/torque. Will 
keep you posted.
