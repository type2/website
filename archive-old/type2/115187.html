&gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually the opposite is true. The injectors pulse on time varies  as a
&gt;  function of throttle advance. The differential pressure at the  injector 
&gt;tip
&gt;  is fixed at the regulator value measured with the vacuum line removed 
&gt;from
&gt;  the regulator. The details can be found in  &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; 
&gt;Engine
&gt;  Management&quot;  by Charles O. Probst,SAE.

&gt;Then Charles has not seen the difference with and without vacuum at idle 
&gt;using Calif smog test equipment!  CO
&gt;goes way up when the vacuum line is disconnected and capped. Fuel pressure 
&gt;goes to 35ish and the bus WILL fail
&gt;the smog test. Real life and text books are 2 different things.

You are quite correct Karl. Pulling the vacuum line will cause a over rich 
condition because the differental pressure jumps to over 50 psi. But that is 
not the condition I was attempting to describe.

My point is that the fuel rail pressure reading obtained with the line 
pulled is the same value as the fixed pressure differential at the injector 
tip in normal operation. The fixed differential is not easy to measure 
directly in the normal operating condition because of the vacuum component.

Nevertheless Bosch  L-Jetronic FI system is a constant  pressure (at the 
injector tip) modulated pulse time scheme.

Sorry for not making my example clear.

Chuck
