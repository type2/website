&gt; what damage will this cause and what can I do to the
&gt; offending gas station?

Chances are if you had a problem, other people did. If it's a reputeable (ie
big brand) station, they're already dealing with people with FUBARed FIs.
(New low emission cars' computers have probably detected a problem and their
owners are fuming as badly as their cars.)  Get in line since the gas
company is the one with the problem (not you). And yours is easy to solve.


For a bus, I would imagine draining and re-filling plus some additive will
probably clean it out but REMEMBER:

What comes out of that tank is hazardous waste and must be disposed of
properly (at *their* expense)!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Also remember that you're probably emitting more than your share of tail
pipe emissions: no problem if you live in Houston but a big one in LA
(remember: we had NO smog alerts last year and we want to keep it that way).
