Subject: large parts stash found (owner wants out)

I am not very computer literate so please forward this message to other lists
so &quot;the word&quot; will get out.

Small business in the New Orleans area has a large supply of USED (no NOS) VW
parts (mostly engine) that he wants to clear out fast. 27 years in the
business and wants to get rid of the stock. He would prefer to sell it all at
once, but large purchases will not be refused. PLEASE do not nickle and dime
this guy to death for one item. If possible come down bring cash and take a
truck load or more home.

I have explored the shop and spotted many removed items (engine parts) and
several dozen engines and transmissions. (3) 40 horse motors (1) almost
complete. Yes there are also doors, rims, window glass, and misc BS.

Here is the address and phone number: (tell him &quot;MIKE&quot; posted this message on
the internet, so I get credit for it)
