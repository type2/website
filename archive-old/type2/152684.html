Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator question...which of these to buy?

Meg -

The AL79X does not fit Type 2s.  This alternator is primarily
installed on 77-82 VW Rabbits, along with a variety of other
Watercooled VW &amp; Audi models.

You didn't indicate the year of your Type 2, so it's a bit difficult
to answer your question.  But here are some general points to
consider:

Most 72-79 Type 2s were equipped with the 55 amp Alternator (AL75X) as
standard equipment.

Some 75-79 Type 2s, especially Campmobiles were equipped with the 70
amp Alternator (AL108X).  This alternator is different enough that it
has it's own style of pulley which does not fit the 55 amp model
properly.  In fact the pulleys are not interchangeable, unless some
modification is made.

Here are some other differences:

1.  55 amp model has a black metal plate bolted onto the rear
(actually towards the front of the vehicle) with the connecting
harness running thru a grommet and also has the hot air exhaust rubber
elbow attached to it.

2.  70 amp model has no metal plate bolted to the rear (towards the
front of the vehicle) like it's 55 amp cousin.  The hot air exhaust
rubber elbow (which is also different from the 55 amp model) attaches
directly to the aluminum cast body of the alternator.

The alternator must be removed to properly identify which model it is.
