Or, you can be like me, and after you have done the &quot;circle tie them in&quot;
around the car with child seats and  kid seat lifters, you get in and see some
debris fly off of your roof when you drive away and realize tooooo late, it
was your lunch and briefcase, jeez I got skinny from no lunch and learned how
to &quot;gandy dance&quot;, in front of an audience! The wake up call, was when I put my
wallet on the roof, and it blew into the kids in the rear facing seats, lap!
