&gt; I just spent the past few hours trying to get my wiper motor working.

Everyone learns that the hard way.

&gt; Rained on me the whole time I was working on this.

Are you saying that's ironic?

&gt; When I had checked out the switch a couple weeks ago, the thing was
&gt; shorted all across the contacts. That tells me that the switch burned
&gt; out the motor which now draws an outrageous amount of current to not
&gt; move anything.

That's what motors do when they can't move. My electricity theory is rusty
but iirc the back emf keeps the motor from accelerating and drawing excess
amounts of current.
