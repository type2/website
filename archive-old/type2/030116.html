&gt; In Sunday's Washington Post in the Beakman &amp; Jax section in the comics, they
&gt; give a solution so that you can weigh the van without a scale.
&gt; 
&gt; George Lyle, you may want to comment on the accuracy of this method :-)

Cool idea, correct in theory _if_ the contact patch were a perfect
rectangle and _if_ the sidewall did nothing to support the car.  I'm sure
that this method would yield good ballpark numbers, say +/-30%

Now, I _have_ weighed my bus with a bathroom scale.

To do this, you need a 2X6 6 feet long, a block of wood the same thickness
as the scale, and two short lengths of 1/2 inch galvinized pipe.

Mark the wood 6 inches in from one end, then make marks at 4 feet and 5
feet from the first mark.

Jack the bus up  so that the tire is at least 6 inches off the ground.
Put the 2X6 under the tire with the 4 foot mark centered under the tire.
Lift the 2X6 and slide the scale under the zero point and the wood block
under the 5' mark.  The scale will be further from the wheel than the
block!  Use the galvinized pipe lengths as pivots between the 2X6 and the
scale and the 2X6 and the block.  Be sure that the axle is directly over
the 4' mark and the parking brake is off.  Set the tare control on the
scale to zero the reading.  Lower the bus onto the 2X6 and read the scale.
Multiply the scale reading by 5 to get the weight of that wheel.  repeat
for the other wheels.

To do this really right, you have to block the other three wheels to the
same height as the wheel being weighed.

OTOH you can drive your bus to a certified truck scale, give the guy a
ten dollar bill, and get a number directly!
