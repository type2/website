Subject: Re: [T2] Update on &quot;Bizzare failing under load, 75 FI-fuel
  delivery low?

Today I moved the 75 onto ramps aand yanked the fuel filter and drained
the tank outlet line into a bucket.    Filter was totally blocked and
rusty silt came out of the line for a few seconds until it ran free.
Can't believe any gas made it through that- it could allow the fuel rail
to get 28 psi at idle, but any demand could not send the needed volume
through and thus the injectors gave too little fuel and quickly leaned
the mix under load.  Obviously a better ECU that gets mix data via an
oxygen sensor could compensaate the mix, but give no better power.
    Put in new filter, ran bus, and it died in 12-15 seconds- restarted
only in little fits.  Checking fuel pressure I noticed it had dropped to
like 10....not sure pump was running, so I shorted the positive lead to
the battery positive, and heard it running.  Pressure no better.  As a
past repair had added an access plate over the tank sender, I removed it
and removed the sender and looked in the tank with a snakelight.  Looked
rather silty (loose rust), but I did not see sludge. I noticed that even
after draining the tank, about 1'2&quot; of gas was in the bottom, and this
must be due to the bowl shaped baffle, with the outlet pipe welded up to
this baffle.  Rust collected in the baffle likely blocked the
outlet/fuel filter, and hopefully the flush removed most of it.  I
drained some more from the tank and fearing the pump may have been
ruined due to starvation, put a hose on the pump outlet.  Gave it
positive juice; it easily put out a cup in about 10 seconds.  My 78 had
a similar problem 3 years ago, and yearly fuel filter changes has
yielded no more blockage. Now the 75 bus runs fine, with 34 lbs fuel
pressure.  At least I can say I know how poorly it runs even at 17 lbs
pressure!
