&gt; &gt;So, I was curious what the craziest offroad trail is that people 
&gt; &gt;have taken their bus on.  We're talking the standard loaf, 79 and 
&gt; &gt;down, 2wd, no syncros ;)

oh yeah reminds me, WAY back in 1976 I was out in New Mexico in my 65
westy and drove up Baldy Mountain to olde baldy town, road said 4WD only
but I was young and nutty,  bus made it up and back no problem.(boy scouts
who have been to Philmont will know the trail)
