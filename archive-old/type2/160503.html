Subject: Re: [T2] air intake boot

Are you referring to the &quot;S&quot; hose between the AFM/air
cleaner and the throttle body?  I have heard of people
using &quot;Shoe Goo&quot; to do a permanent repair to these but
have not done it myself. I once looked through several
bins of these - probably around a hundred per bin -
maybe 4 bins full - and found that about 8 out of 10
had cracks.

If the crack is wide, you may want to use something
like fibreglass drywall tape embedded in the shoe goo
to give it some structure / support. -BaH

&gt; boot where it curves at

&gt; like silicone?
