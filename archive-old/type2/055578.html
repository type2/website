Subject: Air Flow Meter lubricant?

Volks: The Air Flow Meter on my van spent some time without a cover over the
variable resistor. I am assuming
that it has got abrasive dust on it, and want to clean it before I install a
new cover. 
Any Ideas on what procedure to use? What solvent would be safe, if any? Is
there any sort of 
lubricant on the ceramic resistive element that I'm in danger of washing
off? If so, what and how would
I replace it? 

At present I'm just planning to dry wipe it with a clean cloth, and clean
the slider  contact pont with plain paper.

Thanks Bill Crick
