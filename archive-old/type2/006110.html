Tim,
I have a 1600 bug motor in my 1979 bus.  Did you put a throw out bearing
guide on your transmission?  And does the clutch engage?  If yes and no, I
experienced this exact thing a couple weeks ago.  The guide is too long and
applies pressure to the pressure plate, so cut it off.  As far as whether to
get a pressure plate and disc for the transmission or the motor, I got mine
for the motor.  Though I feel like sometimes it slips when in a head wind,
going uphill or something.  I couldn't get much from the list on this one.
Anyone?
