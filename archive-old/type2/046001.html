&gt;Has anyone installed one of the Carver Model P4 Proane/Butane heaters?
&gt;I found one for $700.  
&gt;
&gt;Is that a reasonable price?  

I have one from the original list purchase, I don't believe it is the
P4 but they didn't change much.

FWIW we paid something around $400 then ('95??) because Tom
Forhan organized the import without profit as a group deal.  Lashley or
whoever does the tents has always sold them for a good bit more, as is
his prerogative for importing them, I didn't think he wanted that much
though, so I'd check him first.

Thing is incredible, puts out serious heat.  But, I recall recently reading
that Carver was going out of business or not making that heater,
because I sort of recall fearing parts availability in the future.  Is $700
reasonable, seems steep to me as good gas heaters are around for
$200-$300 if you look, maybe less if you steal one from an unknowing
yard, but it's hard to measure the price of year round camping and
driving comfort.  If you just want it to drive, look for a BA6 in a yard in
a '80-'82ish Vanagon Camper, they were damn common in those early
aircooled campers.  If you want to stay toasty camping, the Carver is
hard to beat.
