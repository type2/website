Subject: RE: My 914 bus/longish

&gt;To add, Im not sure if the 914 is 2.0 or not. My mech said they
&gt;all were but
&gt;avp has 17-1800 914's?

That is correct there are other cc sizes as indicated. I think there is a
2.1 or 2.2 also if I remember right. Bad period of time for my mind though.

&gt;Does any one have any suggestions as to wich route to take in their
&gt;experience?

&gt;The 914 rebuild(2.0)

My guess is after you have lived with this power there's no way you'll be
truely happy going back. It's nice to be able to pass people if you want to
and going up hills makes a difference to.

&gt;or 1700 stock?
&gt;Im at a crossroads here and the knock in the 914 is not getting any
&gt;softer........
&gt;ALSO...(sorry)   he stated that a 914 is very much like a VW engine except
&gt;for the heads. THre really isnt much diff. so what would be the
&gt;advantage to
&gt;having a 914 2.0 or a VW 2.0?

Internally in the oil sump there is a windage tray that helps keep the oil
from completely moving from one side of the engine to the other when
cornering, at least one of the books I have said that was it's purpose.

&gt;THNK YOU THNK YOU THNK YOU THNK YOU!!!!!!!
&gt;I appreciate all you taking the time to read this. All this back and forth
&gt;is very frustrating!!!
