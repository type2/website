The leak is at the top of the venting, where the rubber part has broken.
When you introduce fuel, it's colder than the atmosphere. It starts to warm
almost immediately; it expands and your full tank becomes fuller; it goes
up into your venting tubes and spills out the hole. You loose enough...or
use enough...and it stops leaking...until you FILL up again. 

An interim fix is not to FILL up, but that doesn't eliminate the fact that
you have fuel vapors introduced into your engine compartment, waiting for
you to arc the battery and supply spark and kapow! I've never tried to
reach up in there, but if you can, go for it! I'd replace this if I could
and I'm sure next time I have the engine out, I'll try to find the rubber
parts up there so I can replace them...maybe it's possible with engine in,
but mine aren't leaking right now.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Yesterday, I had asked the list regarding a MAJOR (waterfall like) fuel
leak on the left side of the engine, when I filled the tank, but what is
strange about this whole thing is that the fuel leak STOPPED completely
after about 5 minutes, and it has yet to leak again?? Maybe if I fill the
tank again?? What gives??
