&gt;Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2000 11:01:50 GMT
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me if it is possible to replace the two rubber boots on the
&gt;three section inlet manifold of my camper without taking the engine out. I
&gt;have read somewhere it is not.
&gt;All the best.

it can be done, but it is really a bitch...you have to loosen up the 
generator, pedastal, pretty much everthing above the tin, and working room 
is minimal trying to get to the head intake nuts....there is actually a 
split boot you can get but these are better for temporary repairs as they 
don't seal as good, but maybe they have improved since i used one ten years 
ago...
