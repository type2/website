Subject: Hot VWs Drag Day - This Sunday

Volks -

Just a note to remind y'all to bring your buses to the Hot VWs Drag Day at 
Irwindale, CA, this Sunday, March 23rd. See www.bugin_dot_com for details.

They'll have a &quot;Buses Only&quot; class just for us. You don't need to be a drag 
racer to have tons of fun! Remember, FUN FOLLOWS BUSES!

Come find us. We'll be on FRS/GMRS Channel 2. Camp out. Swap stories. &quot;Drag&quot; 
race. Watch the Turbo Bugs fly. Enjoy!

Mike &amp; Itch (winners of LAST HVWDD Trophy 2 bracket)
