Subject: (over)adjusting ride height

Hi,

After procrastinating too long I decided to have the work done for me. The rear wheels we toe'ing out and the rear end was 
sagging. Unfortunately I am uncertain of the result. It seems too high now (about 1-2 inches higher than front)  but it may be 
because the front was too low to begin with. The rear now toes in to a very slight amount of camber.  What is the stock 
height of the rear of the bus? It is visibly slanting the bus forward now but I am inclined to think that perhaps the fault lies 
more in a sagging front. Do new shocks make any difference to ride height at all? Is there any way to add 1 inch to front ride 
height?

Bob
