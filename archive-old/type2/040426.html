&gt; On the gas tank... baruch hashem, I have not had to deal with this yet...
&gt; my tank seems intact and I am not looking forward to it!


Speaking of gas tanks....I'm still looking for one for my 82. Any deals?
Replacing the tank is straight forward. My current tank can only be filled
half way as my vent lines on top are shot. Not worth replacing on a bad tank
anyway.
