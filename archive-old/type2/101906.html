&gt;The BFG tires are HUGE! I mean physically large. I have a set of these exact
&gt;tires  which are going on a vw thing, but I am not sure about putting them
&gt;on a bus. They will fit I suppose, but they will really make your bus look a
&gt;bit like a mini monster truck. Maybe that's good! In fact the set I have
&gt;were sold to me by a fellow in my local club who refused to put them on his
&gt;bus because he felt they were just too big. They are roughly 1&quot; bigger on
&gt;the diameter than stock, which doesn't sound like much, but it is.

They are big, but they fit just fine.  The look is not as aggressive as you might think, because to start with bus tires are small relative to the size of the bus itself.  I also mounted mine with the raised white letters inboard which helped to conceal their nature.  My first impression was that the look was &quot;tough&quot; but after a while I stopped noticing the difference as it really isn't that extreme, especially with the stock hub caps.

I agree with Robb that they really improve the handling of a bus and are better in adverse weather than &quot;normal&quot; tires.  Maybe the best you can buy in that respect.  They won't, however, make your one-wheel-drive bus into a Jeep.  I still managed to get stuck on some wet grass on the side of the road once.  Very embarassing.
