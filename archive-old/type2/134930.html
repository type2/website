Subject: RE: [T2] Tires

&gt; Hey there Ron,
&gt; These tires look great. I don't see mention
&gt; for offroad or mud use on these.... I need
&gt; something that is good in the mud and dirt.


The Hankook RA08 has an all-season highway tread pattern.  It's primarily
intended for good highway performance and handling, and a quiet highway
ride.  Since it is an M&amp;S (mud &amp; snow) tire, it will do better off-road or
in mud than a summer highway tire would, but the bottom line is that it's
not primarily intended for this use. The more aggressive all-terrain tread
pattern that would make a tire work better off-road typically has an adverse
effect on highway comfortability such as road noise (especially when coupled
with the stiffer sidewall that a bus requires).  So no one bus tire will be
the best both on and off road. Since most of my customers use their busses
primarily on the highway, for now my focus is on tires that are designed for
highway performance/comfort.
