Gentlemen:
I'm looking for an aircooled bus in decent shape(not fully restored,I want a weekend project). I'm located at Ft. Walton Beach, FL, and I'm willing to drive a couple hundred miles if neccesary. I don't have a year preference,would like a camper, but any bus in good shape will do. Thanks 

Victor
