Subject: My bus may run today and VW propiganda WW2 pin

Hello list,

Well, this afternoon, I am planning to try and det the
timing on my bus by using the suggestions that you all
have given me and my bently. 

I am looking for someone who knows a few things about
WW2 Volkswagen memorbilia. I was strolling through a
Army surplus and collectable store the other day and
found a metal vw bug pin. It is about an inch to two
inches in diameter. it is made up of a early VW beetle
surrounded by a Nazi cog. (It doesn'thave the Nazi
Swatstica incorporated in it) Has anyone had any
experience in such pins or know what this pin could be
worth?
 If anyone does have any info, please contact me off
the list. My email, dtk3001_at_yahoo_dot_com has been changed
to volknstein_at_yahoo_dot_com. Thanks!

David Kelly
From Wilmington, North Carolina
