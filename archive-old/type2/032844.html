Subject: Re: [VB] Projects, your neighbors, and you

This discussion brings to mind the plight of the Air Cooled VW Junk Yard,
well known purveyor of VW stuff with one of the finest and most informative
VW-oriented websites on the WWW:

        http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/

Their battles/encounters with the local bureaucracy are legendary, and,
ultimately, tragic.  The ACVWJY website won't be up much longer, so catch it
while you can.  Be sure to click on the &quot;closed&quot; link, and read AJ's final
&quot;Report from the Hinterlands&quot;.
