My fantasy is:
To see one go down the street, '80 Vanagon
see one get on the street, '67 Westy Resto
keep one on the street, '83 Westy Vanagon
and get one off of the street. '57 Single cab

Roughly I am attempting to reduce the harem to two drivers and one to tinker
on (return the '57 to 6v 36hp dead stock) over a *long* period of time.

If he keeps up the good vibes Dyer Lytle is gonna be first in line (outside
of Mrs.VanBondo~of course) for a ride in the RFH.
