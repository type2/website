Thanks to everyone for the responses.  The problem was that the clevis
holes had rotted away and totally opened on the end.  This was very
difficult to fix because I had never seen a clevis until this one, so I
didn't know what was wrong.  Things like this are hard to explain when you
don't know what you're talking about.  I wish that one of my books had a
picture of one in it.  Well, now I know.  I've got it attached to the lever
and now I just have to slide it through (I know: grease, grease, grease).
Thanks for the responses.
Hope to see lots of listees at Sevierville this weekend.  Look for us in a
green/white splittie;  rust abounds!  
Grace &amp; Peace,
Lucas
