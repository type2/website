Muir, author of the &quot;idiot&quot; book, has a pretty detailed procedure for
evaluating a vehicle and negotiating a purchase. For me, simply getting a bus
became more important than getting a &quot;good&quot; bus. I resolved to have no
regrets.

Broken down, crawling under the bus in a parking lot on Lincoln Blvd. in Santa
Monica, hours from home yesterday, I had no regrets, no second thoughts.

The bigger question comes before you get on the plane. Will you be able to get
back on the plane empty-handed if your &quot;spider sense&quot; starts to tingle--either
that or drive your new bus home [or part way home] with no regrets?

My own decision was based less on &quot;will this bus be reliable&quot; than, &quot;can I
live with its faults?&quot; Like a foster child, it's been full of surprises, but
so far I'm happy.
