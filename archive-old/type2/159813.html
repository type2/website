&gt; Question 1 - How do I clamp this additional battery down?  How have others done it?
&gt;   
neither my main or axillary battery are clamped down.  weight and 
gravity seem to do just fine

&gt; I would like to have my radio on when camping and plan to add an inverter in the future that can also be used when the key is off, I want to run everything off only the second battery when parked with the engine off (and add a solar charger eventually).
&gt;   
I ran the hot wire from the aux battery to a fuse panel under the bed, 
and then rewired everything to that fuse panel.
&gt; I have no issue with adding a switch to change over to accessory only when camped if this is the best solution.
&gt;
&gt; Question 2 - How do I wire my bus so I can run my radio and other powerered accessories without having the key in the run position?  I need really small words for this answer, I am not an electrician for sure.
&gt;
&gt;   
see above answer.  everything from my fuse panel is always hot .. key or 
not.

If you search thesamba for posts to the bay window forum by pb24ss you 
can see pics of my entire installation.
