I would be almost certain that there is oil in your heat exchangers and its
being burnt off when you drive and blown into the interior via those 2 heater
pipes in back.  I had the same problem once...

find out why oil is in your heat exchangers... (pushrod tube seals? valve cover
gaskets?) and then fix that...and let the rest of the oil burn off...thats what
I did.

hope this helps
later
