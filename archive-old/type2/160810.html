Subject: Cold Start Valve and TTS

I have been trying to determine the reason why I am
not getting the rapid start that I should in my '76.

After many posts on IAC, I decided to ask you folks.
So far, I can get her to start if I turn the engine
and mess with the AFM wiper, but I have been told that
the problem may very well be with the cold start valve
or thermo time switch.

I have tested both independently and got a spray from
the CSV as well as a VERY faint light from the TTS.
When I plugged them in together and tested them the
next day (make sure the TTS was cold) I could not get
the CSV to spray. 

Does this mean my TTS is done?
