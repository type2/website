Dear friends:

Once more I ask for you very good help.  When I was in Miami last month,
I purchased from Andres Imported Parts a set of O´rings for the push rod
tubes.  As I recall from the guy that sold me the van, these push rods
could come out without removing the heads, just removing the rocker
arms, the rods and that was it. . . .   is this true ??.  The oil is
leaking more and more and is pooring on the heaters and is smoking  so
much that every time I stop it gets  inside the car.   I could use any
advise.

Thanks and regards.

Yours,
Pedro/
1973 TypeIV engine Transporter.
