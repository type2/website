Subject: RE: NEEDED: crossover pipe and EGR Filter
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;Actually, the piece is not &quot;Y&quot;,it is &quot;U&quot;.  I have a 79 bus (federal
&gt; &gt;model).  apparently, this model was only for the year 79
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, Casey, I thought the '79 used the same system as the '78.
&gt; Nevertheless, $400 is a big chunk of money for that piece, new or used.


VW used one crossover pipe in '75-78, and another in '79-83. This is
referring to the long sort-of-j-shaped pipe that connects the heat
exchangers to the cat or muffler, which I suppose is what you mean. It also
is referring to the 49-state systems.  Some California busses used a
catalytic converter that was tucked in along side the drivers heat
exchanger, for which these parts are no longer available.

The original crossover pipe consisted of two parts.  The elbow section of
the '75-78 pipe is still available at a fairly reasonable cost, but alas the
main section of the crossover pipe is not.  This means that if your
crossover pipe rusts out, you can either try to find a used one, or replace
your complete exhaust system with one of my $79 ones that does away with the
whole mess, and replaces everything behind the heat exchangers (but does not
hold up as well as the original system).

The crossover pipe for the '79 to '83 is available again, for $279 (which is
high, but beats the last dealer price of $600!!!).  It is now a single
piece, which goes from the heat exchangers to the cat.  The cat, muffler,
and tailpipe are all available fairly reasonably, so the most expensive part
is that crossover pipe.  There is also an $89 complete exhaust system that
will do away with all of this mess, too, and replace everything behind the
heat exchangers.  But a '79-83 legally was supposed to have a catalytic
converter, and the $89 setup will not accommodate one, so you may run into
inspection hassles depending on where you live.  I have heard of some people
saving their expensive crossover/catalytic system to put on prior to
inspection, and using an $89 setup the other 11 months so as not to rust out
the expensive system (not that I am recommending this).

The EGR filter is also available.  I'm writing from home right now and
working from memory, but I recall the price to be somewhere around $150 for
the '79 up version, and under $100 for the '78-back.
