Hi Everyone,
   I'd like to put my 2 cents in on this topic.  As an aircraft mechanic of 
more than 25 years experience, I've done more than just a few glue, or as 
they are known &quot;bonded&quot; repairs.
  Getting good results depends on good set up and preparation of the job.  
First both surfaces must be free of any oil and dirt.  That includes oils 
from the skin of your hands.  Second, the parts must have the proper fit and 
finish.  Not all of these glues have the ability to fill gaps and retain 
their strength and some will only bond to a rough surface.  Next, the 
temperature and humidity of the work area need to be within limits specified 
by the glue's manufacturer.  Once the repair has been glued up, there is 
usually a required clamping time and pressure.  Then the repair needs to be 
left undisturbed for the prescribed amount of time.
   I guess in short what I'm trying to say is, use the proper glue for the 
job and follow the instructions to the letter.
