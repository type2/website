Subject: Re: [T2] PUSH BUTTON STARTER and FLAMES

I wired the switch so that in the &quot;Accessory&quot; posotion there is no power to
the coil. I learned that one the hard way, too. &gt;grin&lt;

&gt; &gt; After making a silly mistake with some under-dash wires, I fried my
ignition

system
&gt; &gt; since I couldn't wait for a new stock switch to arrive by mail. First of

&gt; &gt; One advantage to this system is that I now have an &quot;Accessory&quot; position
on
&gt; &gt; my ignition--something VW never saw fit to include. I also see it as

&gt;
&gt; BEWARE, if the ignition is on your coil is hot, and if the distributor is
&gt; lined up just right it will totally fry your coil....ask me how I know
&gt; ;8*{
&gt;
&gt; don't know if this same problem exists with a Pertronix which I have now,
&gt; but not taking any chances
&gt;
&gt; &gt; systems that accomplish the same function.  (Remember we're talking
daily
&gt; &gt; drivers, here, not pure restorations.)
&gt;
&gt; and that is a major difference..  when you ONLY have your type 2 as your
&gt; sole transport and you have to get to work tommorrow morning, well
&gt; sometimes you don't exactly follow stock.
&gt;
&gt;    look at my van, more or less mostly stock (is that an oxymoron?) but I
&gt; am the one who pushes it 20k a year and if it don't go, I don't go unless
&gt; I can con my wife out of her S*t*rn, which won't hold the &quot;stuff&quot; I have
&gt; to carry round for work..
&gt;
&gt; sometimes necesity forces our hands.
&gt;
&gt; as for the fuel pump that started this (or was it ignition switch) I don't
&gt; know about rebuilds and the $$$ is steep, so I have grabbed every fuel
&gt; injection type fuel pump I see when junkyarding, usually have a tested one
&gt; in the van when traveling beyond my local AAA limit.
&gt;
&gt; I wasn't going to say anything yet but I will try to get out to my &quot;Spare
&gt; parts storage garage&quot; over the weekend and see if there is a working
&gt; extra, tis Christmas, no warranty but the price is right.
