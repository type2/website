Subject: Rocker panels for 71 bus
Date: Sun, 21 Feb 1999 16:56:00 -0800
Message-Id: &lt;36d0914894de002_at_mail01.uwec_dot_edu&gt;

This is my first message, so hello everyone.  I am currently de-rusting a
supposedly rust free 71 Westy.  Its not too bad...needs a new frt left wing
and the left rocker (below the crease) was riddled with holes.  The bottom
lip (where the drain holes are) is completely solid.  I ground out the
middle section.  I was told by Mofoco that no one makes this repair panel. 
I can weld in sheet metal, but would prefer to get the proper repair
panel....Any help????   Also I have 2 '72 buses and lots of extra
Westy/campmobile parts laying around if anyone is interested.
Thanks

'71 Westy
