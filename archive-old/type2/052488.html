Subject: [T2] Re: Friday, Who's bus

earlier today I was cruising up I-95 between Baltimore and Delaware, just
after the toll both I noticed a bay coming up behind me, so I slowed down
and we cruised together to Elkton exit where we both got off, but in
different directions (coincidence)  just wondering if anyone on the list
had the two tone pumpkin colored late bay, nice.  I was in the Blue and
white one.
