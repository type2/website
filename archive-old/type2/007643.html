Subject: 73 Safare finally comes home
Date: Sun, 08 Nov 1998 19:27:07 PST

I finally took delivery of my 1973 Safare poptop yesterday, getting the 
title and getting it home took a little longer than I thought it would. 
Now I'm ready to embark on my ambitious new project!
 The PO quit driving it six years ago because of problems with the carbs 
(the stock dual Solexes)I even found reciepts from 1977 for problems 
with the carbs! I know there's been tons of discussion about this 
before, but I'd like some advice on which way to go with the whole 
carb/fuel pump/smog junk situation. I'm leaning towards ripping off all 
of this stuff and installing dual Webers and an 009 dist. just because 
that is what I already have on my 71 and have been fairly satisfied. Is 
it possible to completely remove the EGR, the air pump,etc.? What do I 
do with the tubes coming out of the heads. If I can't remove it I'll 
have to buy new because it's all seized up and full of rat nest. 
Somewhere along the line an electric fuel pump was installed but I don't 
know if it ever ran with it, should I go back to the stock one? I really 
just want to have the simplest setup possible, I'm willing to spend a 
little to do it since I paid almost nothing for the bus.
