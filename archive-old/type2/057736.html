Subject: Re: life expectancy of muffler

&gt; What is the life expectancy of a...I guess it would be &quot;stock&quot; muffler. I
have
&gt; a 70, 
&gt; 1600 SP bay window. I have had the muffler between 2 to 3 years and it is
time
&gt; to replace it. Does this sound right? Seems a little soon to me. Thanks
in
&gt; advance.

When you say stock, I assume you mean aftermarket made to stock-ish specs?
If so, you may have bought a muffler similar to the one I did in 1996 for
my 1978 camper -- a black powdercoat painted muffler made in Brazil. I paid
$80-90 for it, with the understanding it would last two or three years or
so if I re-painted it with hi-temp paint right away -- this was according
to the salesman, who made no bones about the fact the thing was by no means
top of the line. All the black paint burned off in a few miles of driving,
just like he predicted it would, I re-painted with black hi-temp paint
(easy enough), and it still looks great two years later.
But I don't expect it to last forever. What you don't want to do -- ever,
IMHO -- is take your bus to Meineke/Midas/etc, those places that cut your
stock system to shreds, weld a new muffler on and guarantee it for life.
Don't get me wrong -- they do a great job on most cars. I've gotten several
mufflers from such folks.Their life-long promise is great in a Honda, for
instance, whose engine naturally produces a lot of moisture while running
and thus rusts mufflers from the inside out on a regular basis. Need a new
muffler six times on a car they've already serviced? They'll hook you up
with a half-dozen.
But I'll say again: never, ever cut your stock system. The parts that
comprise it are MAJOR expensive.
My advice, especially to save a $ ? Get a lesser-market muffler, slap it
on, and save any stock components -- J-tubes, etc. -- in case you want to
go back to stock later. Two or three years on an $80 muffler isn't so bad,
depending upon climate, amount and type of driving, etc.

.02 cents poorer but making you richer (or asleep),
