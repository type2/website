Subject: Re: Good Experiences with RMMW

I ordered numerous bits &amp; pieces from RMMW when I was restoring my '73
Sportsmobile.  Everything arrived in perfect shape at the expected time.  I
didn't feel the prices were too out of line for what they offered and the
service they provided.  My full carpet set ran me about $150, fits pretty
damn close to perfect, and looks snazzy to boot.  I'd would recommend 'em
to any VDubber.....

Just another satisfied customer...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Their service is outstanding, but how come no one ever mentions their
huge
&gt; &gt;mark-up? In any event, in business terms they're doing the right thing
by
&gt; &gt;targeting the growing segment of affluent hobbyists. After all, old VWs
&gt; &gt;have ceased to be a poor person's means of transportation and have
instead
&gt; &gt;turned into Sunday cutesies for Eddie Bauer princes and princesses ;-)
&gt; &gt;(&quot;pardon me, would you have some... Salsa?&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I think RMMW is brilliant and I respect them highly for what
&gt; they've accomplished. No punch line, I really mean it. They identified a
&gt; HUGE unexploited niche and did it right. They needed a car with a huge
pool
&gt; of devoted owners who have a nearly constant need for parts, and they
found
&gt; it with the VW--and turned it into an Inc. 500 business.
&gt; 
&gt; There's only one other car I can think of on the planet you could build a
&gt; similar business on, and that's the short Jeep. If I had money I'd
imitate
&gt; RMMW selling Jeep parts.
