&gt; Gentleperson-
&gt;                      Someone suggested that Ford Ranger wheels have the same
&gt; bolt pattern as the 5 bolt loaf wheels...Can I get a confirmation on that and is

I was told by a guy that put the ranger wheels on his bus that
&quot;they fit, but I had to hog out the holes a little since the fit wasn't perfect&quot;

not for me, try getting all five holes &quot;hogged out&quot; identically.
