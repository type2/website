I feel your pain

&gt; I took a chance and bought an automatic =9278 bus with a camper conversio=
n=20

I have a 78 auto tranny bus also, had it for 8+ years

&gt; last April for $500. It had been sitting in the PO=92s driveway probably=
=20

I paid $2 then we had to put it back together, but it had been stored
inside (sort of)

&gt; the aircooled VW newsgroup. After installing a new fuel pump, fuel=20
&gt; lines, and repairing a few other items, they decided to do a compression=
=20

the fuel line repairs was a good thing.

&gt; test. It was then that they discovered that the engine was shot. I was a=
=20
&gt; wee bit ticked off because it seemed sensible to do a compression test=20

well the compression test tells you a lot but not decisive about weather
or not the engine is shot

&gt; first before doing anything else. The repairs at this point were already=
=20
&gt; about $1000. It was either throw in the towel or go ahead and have them=
=20
&gt; rebuild the engine. So I decided to go with the rebuild as I figured=20

how much did they charge for the rebuild, a decent rebuild of the 2liter
engine, done reasonably well is at least $1,500 (my rebuild was almost
$2,500)

&gt; =09Months passed and still the bus was not ready. They just kept=20

shouldn't take more than a month, including chasing down all the parts,
someone who does it for a living (AVP, Boston Bob etc figure about a week)

&gt; Almost immediately upon getting it home, it began stalling when I=20
&gt; started it up and shifted it into drive. I=92ve never driven a bus before=
,=20

probably not the engine they rebuilt but caused by the other parts not
rebuilt, but they should have checked it out=20

&gt; after driving it out of the city (I live in NYC), I realized it had no=20
&gt; power whatsoever on even the slightest of inclines. I asked around about=
=20
&gt; this and most people seemed to think that was my fate with an automatic=
=20

NOT SO, no an automatic is not as &quot;zippy&quot; as a manual tranny bus in the
same condition, but on the level you should be able to get up to 60mph or
so in less than a minute.

&gt; to Cleveland, OH for Thanksgiving. Until then, I had only put about 150=
=20
&gt; miles on it. The trip would give me a chance to really see how it=20
&gt; performed on the highway and it would put the magical 1000 miles on it=20
&gt; so I could take it to the repair shop when I got back.

do you have any guages?  were you monitoring your temps?

&gt; On the highway, my girlfriend and I experienced the invigorating thrill=
=20
&gt; of nearly being rear-ended by eighteen-wheelers every time we hit the=20
&gt; slightest hill.

I don't know which way you went, PA turnpike?? or I-80,  but I drive that
way often and can keep up 45MPH+ on the 8mile grade up to Allegany tunnel

&gt; We soon learned to make advantageous use of=20
&gt; straight-aways and to downshift into 2nd as soon as we approached that=20

shouldn't downshift an automatic tranny bus it should do it automatically
as soon as the MPH drops below 45 or so.

&gt; Eventually we made it there, but the next time I tried to drive it, it=20
&gt; =93died=94 after stalling about 20 times. I had no means to get it fixed=
=20
&gt; that holiday weekend so I called my VW repair shop in NJ when I got back=
=20
&gt; to NYC. They said it was probably a fuel relay issue and that they would=
=20

fuel relay wouldn't be causing that problem. not directly anyway.

&gt; a tricycle. So now I have the pleasure of trying to make the VW repair=20
&gt; shop in NJ honor the engine warranty and pay for the repairs for a bus=20
&gt; that=92s being worked on by a shop in Cleveland. I couldn=92t be more pis=
sed=20

don't blame you, you should be pissed

&gt; and just generally nauseous about this whole situation. I=92ve now had th=
e=20
&gt; bus for about a year and have driven it for a total of about 6 weeks. I=
=20
&gt; paid enough money on the initial repairs to buy a bus that was in far=20

maybe, maybe not

&gt; better shape. Lesson learned. On Friday, I talked to the repair shop in=
=20
&gt; NJ and explained the situation. He said he would call the shop in=20
&gt; Cleveland to find out exactly what the problem was. He didn=92t, of=20
&gt; course, and I caught him in a lie about it later that day, though I=20
&gt; didn=92t call him on it. He did say he would =93try calling again=94 on M=
onday=20
&gt; and that he would be willing to send him the parts the Cleveland shop=20
&gt; needed plus help pay for the charges. The bus did break down after only=
=20
&gt; 650 miles and about 6 weeks and I did call him at the time to tell him=20
&gt; about it. But, after waiting this long, the 3-month warranty period is=20
&gt; probably lawfully over.=20

well you did contact them within the 3 month period

&gt; assuming I can get them to do this. Does anyone have a similarly awful=20
&gt; experience that could shed some light on how to deal with this?=20

yes, one word,  &quot;GEX&quot; =20

&gt; Hopefully I don=92t sound too dramatic. I realize that this isn=92t the e=
nd=20
&gt; of the world, but it has really soured my experiences with buses. It=20

well maybe it could be your daily driver and not have another set of
wheels.  ride the transit bus for 6 months while your bus is &quot;laidup&quot;

&gt; shouldn=92t be this painful to have a bus that runs. Thanks for letting m=
e=20

no it shouldn't,  get a Bentley manual and some tools (this list will give
you all the suggestions you can use) and start getting your hands dirty
because a 24 year old vehicle of any type is gonna need some TLC, and if
you don't have any, the money at least find the time or someone you trust
to help you get going

good luck
Bob
