Subject: timing.

Does anybody know what I should time my 77 westi to?  I think that factory
it was like 5 deg ATDC, but I have heard that that was for emmitions
purposes, and that I should set it for something like 7.5 deg BTDC.  Muirs
book says 7.5, and the Haynes book says 5.  Does anybody know the
realitive advantage of each?  I have it set right now to 7.8 BTDC, but
havent noticed any improvement.  I'd appreciate any wisdom ya'll have to
offer.

stop the madness before the sadness
