Subject: Koni availability (last last last chance)

Obi-Wan Kenobi: &quot;That boy is our last hope.&quot;
Yoda: &quot;No. There is another.?&quot;

Now that the last batch of Koni's have come in to Bus Depot what you are you do if you still want some?

If you are in Europe, CSP is selling them. I have no idea how much stock they have but here's the link:

Prices are terrible for folks here in the USA but if you are in Europe I would snap them up...

Classic Garage (where I found my original set of NOS rears) called me and told me they have 2 pairs of Koni's for the front (70-79 bus). They had promised to acquire these for me from the Holland factory before Ron and I arranged the group buy. I thought it was going to be a NOS pair but the boxes are new.

Call (845) 940-1900 and ask for Tim. The part you want is 80-2110.
