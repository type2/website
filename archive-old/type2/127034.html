Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA - resolved

It was this inconsistency that had me alarmed at first, and, combined
with my limited knowledge, sent me down a paranoid path by questioning
the entire documentation content. My problem has been resolved, as are,
I hope, the questions about whose spec's to use. In the thread that I
had with aircooled, the tech said that static timing between 7 and 12
BTDC was correct for the SVDA. So.. what was wrong with my
installation? hehehe... I had the #2 and #4 wires backwards. &lt;pause for
effect&gt; After my head popped out, I verified the timing, re-tuned the
carb and it runs pretty well now. It still has an &quot;unclean&quot; idle that I
can only describe as an incomplete detonation (to novice ears). Perhaps
the mixture isn't quite right. Once the bus starts moving, though, it
runs great. The throttle response is fantastic. Good-bye flatspot. I
plan to spend more time dinking with the weber, but, for now its
running better than the with 009, so it can wait 'til Saturday. I may
just wait until the vaccuum diaphram wears in.
Funny thing about the wires. I'd had the #3 and #4 wrong yesterday. I
guess if there's a way to get 'em wrong I'll find it. Sorry I wasted
everyone's time and I hope this won't color your responses to my future
failings (of which, I expect, there will be many).
Thanks again,

  On Type 1 engines, the vacuum can points &quot;down
&gt; right&quot;.  This means that the #1 score and the cap notch are 180
&gt; degrees off on the SVDA.
&gt; 
&gt; That is to say, the score mark will actually point to #3 when this is
&gt; 
&gt; installed in a Type 4 engine, and the cap notch will be at the front 
&gt; (front is front), whereas it was at the rear on my old distributor 
&gt; (Bosch 0 231 181 012).
