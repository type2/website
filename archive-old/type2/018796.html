&gt; &gt;       Sorry for being late on this thread. But your mail made me think, how am I
&gt; &gt; doing it? I'm so used to manual transmission that I don't think about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I learned to drive on a stick and my first car was a 59 beetle,  had 12
&gt; VW's of various types until my 71 van.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Handicapped people naturally get exeptions. Naturally you are allowed to
&gt; 
&gt; then I became disabled and didn't think I would be able to drive a VW
&gt; anymore, kept the 71 in the backyard for many years trying to figure out
&gt; how to make it an automatic.
&gt; 
&gt; time passes and I still want a bus, traded my Mercedes in for a 78 bus
&gt; with a HP bus drop floor and auto tranny and hand controls, have not
&gt; looked back since.
&gt; 
&gt; Have an old ad I found for HP bus in Billarica(sp) Mass. but have never
&gt; seen another one.  the center of the bus between the axles is lowered 15
&gt; inches and the area below the sliding door drops down to become a ramp.
&gt; really neat arangement with the lower door track.

Bob:
There was a later Vanagon in the Des Moines paper last week with hand
controls and wheelchair lift. I meant to post it earlier but been away
for a few days. If anyone's interested, send me a p-mail and I'll look
it up. 
Might be just the ticket if you need one. Later (76 on) type2 and
vanagon automatics are allegedly about as durable as the sticks (and
more so than the clutches).
