Subject: Re: [T2] SOLEX carbs  in a '72 camper

I didn't keep the original dual solex carbs on my 72camper very long, but if
I remember right they were 34pict2 on the left and 34pict3 on the right and
are different from each other AND the carb on a 70 bus (which should be a
single carb stock). I have some pics if you need them.

Also last time I visited our friend Snoopy I fell in love with his panoramic
rearview mirrow from JC Whitney. They are about 17 bucks for the 17 inch
wide model and very cool. You can see out all the windows and see all the
passengers in your bus. I strongly reccomend it.

 I can take pics of the 68/69 rearview mirrow if anybody needs these.

Happy New Year!

Subject: [T2] SOLEX carbs in a '72 camper


&gt; OK, I have some time on my hands here at work (is it obvious??) and I
&gt; started looking at a manual entitled 'SOLEX - Selection and Tuning of the
&gt; Carburetor'
&gt;
&gt; Wow, neat pictures!!
&gt;
&gt; Question:  what SOLEX carburetor comes standard on the '72 bus/camper, and
&gt; what years VW bus can this be found on??  (Sorry, still at work, and the
'72
&gt; is rusting quietly at home.)
&gt;
&gt; Oh, yes, if you (me, that is) take one apart, is it easy to put back
&gt; together??  I have two extra carburetors from a '70, one intact and one
with
&gt; the choke thing taken apart.  If these are the same as on the '72, I would
&gt; plan to clean them up and replace the ones I have on the '72.
&gt;
&gt; Hey, guys and gals, it IS friday!! Loosen up.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I saw a '68 in a mechanics back yard that has an extended/longer rear
&gt; view mirror.  It is screwed onto the overhead vice twisted in (completely
&gt; stock).  If you have an early camper and cannot see out the rear window
&gt; because your rear has dropped with age (or are sitting tall in the saddle
&gt; because you are 6'4&quot;), this mirror will let you see out the back.
&gt;
&gt; I used a similar one on my '78, and it worked beautifully.  I don't know
&gt; what it would cost, but if it is excellent condition, I would go back for
it
&gt; for someone who could use it.  I have ENOUGH junk in the house. The wife's
&gt; philosophy is 'if you haven't worn the clothes in the past 20 years, get
rid
&gt; of it; if you are not going to use the VW part in the next 5 years, get
rid
&gt; of it!!'
&gt;
&gt; (((  But honey, I'm going to get back down to 165 lbs, so can wear that
&gt; cowboy vest with the fringes and spangles; and I do need to get that third
&gt; set of tires, just in case . . . .  ))
