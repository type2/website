Subject: Re: [T2] gear oil

The new GL5 standard is GL5 with MT1 rating, which is said to be safe for
our synchros. I think the GL5 problem was long in the past, with the problem
having been resolved long ago with the MT1 rating. I looked into it pretty
thoroughly, and sleep well with this item in my gearbox. Better than the old
mung that was in there.

&lt;It had been mentioned to me that there is a rumor about GL-5 gear oil being
potentially corrosive to VW trannys, and that GL-4 was the way to avoid
this. Well, having already replaced my awful, rancid old gear oil with the
only kind available to me at auto supply stores, GL-5, I took this matter up
with my mechanic.&gt;
