&gt; When I see photos of original ac engines from the late sixties/early
&gt; seventies, I see that the vacuum line which connects one of the ports on
&gt; the vacuum advance to the distributor is actually three pieces  -  a short
&gt; length of braided hose,  a J-shaped metal tube, and another short length
of
&gt; hose.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, on my bus and on most rebuilt engines,  the vacuum line
&gt; consists of a simple piece of braided line connecting the advance biscuit
&gt; to the carb.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone fill me in on the purpose of that metal tube on the original
&gt; equipment?
&gt; Is there any way that the absence of this tube is responsible for the
&gt; almost universal hesitation problems we all have?

I believe that second vacuum connection is for the throttle positioner found
on VW's of that era. (late 60's, early 70's).  I have greatly reduced the
hesitation on my 1600 DP/ 34PICT-3/009 with a larger main jet.
