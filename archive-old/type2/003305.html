Hello,

  I have an 1800 engine I've been running in combo with a 78 van 2 litter
fuel injection system for several years. Although it seems underpowered it
has run OK and even passes the emission tests fine here in Seattle.
 My question to you is this: I'm wanting to take it out to solve some
problems with oil leaks and exhaust leaks. I thought this would be a good
time to have the heads rebuilt while I have the engine out. I think I might
want to convert back to manually adjusted valves since I think adjusting
valves is no big deal and I seem be losing faith in the hydraulic
valves.Plus they cost more.
  I'm just wondering if it is possible to switch back now without breaking
open the case. I guess I'll just be pulling out the hydraulic lifters and
putting in regular ones,right? Anything else I need to do?

Thanks,
Neil Sundberg
