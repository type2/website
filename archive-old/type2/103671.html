Subject: brake booster hose

Hi folks,
    I've just come from the archives but would like to hear more
opinions and ideas.  I need to replace the vacuum hoses for the brake
booster on our '71 bus.  The closest thing I can find locally is 1/2
inch heater hose.  It is thick walled and seems to have a fabric
reinforcement embedded in the middle of the rubber.
    Does anyone have a source for the proper hose?  If not, what have
some of you used?
