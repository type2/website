Subject: Re: [VB] What The Heck Is This Thing?

 &gt; Check out this crazy engine on the VW of Brazil
&gt; web site:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://www.vw_dot_com.br/vcsba01.htm
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It looks like some sort of airplane motor, but I
&gt; can't translate the lingo.
&gt; 
&gt; The Volkswagen engines are highly trustworthy, of
&gt; long duration, low
&gt; cost
&gt; and easy maintenance. It is for this reason that it
&gt; has many years
&gt; that the
&gt; Volkswagen engine comes being suitable for use in
&gt; experimental
&gt; aviation.
&gt; American and German companies aeronautizaram engine
&gt; VW entirely,
&gt; producing
&gt; models, that offer to high powers the low rotations.
&gt; Aeronautizados
&gt; engines
&gt; VW arrive to supply up to 110 HP of power and are
&gt; used in
&gt; self-propelled
&gt; gliders and &quot; homebuilts &quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; So said babelfish

Actually there is a home build airplane name after
VW's. I call Volksplane Using an 1800cc or larger
engine. Also smaller utra lights airplanes use 1/2 of
a VW engine. That's right!, they saw the engine block
and cylinder head. Then they install their own
cranshaft and cam. Same 009 dist. When used a full
size engine they machine the heads to fit 2 spark
plugs per cylinder. They also install 2 magnetos. I
meet a shop teacher thet did that for his Bug. There
is also a German factory call Limbach that do engines
that are exactly like VW (But Over priced) aprox
$13,000 to $15,000. The websites bellow you can check
them out!
