Subject: Re: [T2] Grounding the Engine.

If the two straps create a parralel circuit where if R1 is the
resistance of path 1, and R2 is the resistance of path 2, then the
equivalent resistance of the resulting circuit is (R1 x R2 ) / (R1 +
R2) which is going to be less than R1 and less than R2.

The intensity of the current on path 1 will be proportional to 1/R1
and that on path 2 will be proportional to 1/R2. For instance if the
two straps are of equal resistance, half the intensity will go through
each strap.

On paper at least it makes sense to ground the tranny twice.

&gt; 
&gt; The path the current takes during starting is:
&gt; 
&gt; battery pos -&gt; starter -&gt; transmission case -&gt; tranny strap -&gt; body -&gt; battery neg
&gt; 
&gt; The current is only going to take one path (the one of least resistance) but both cables are going to rust out...
