Subject: Re: [T2] help, dropped valve???!!!!

I would take the rocker arm assembly, simple to do, and see if the #3
exhaust exhaust valve sits higher than its brethern. If so, you've got
problems.

Did you get fries with that head?

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; #3 exaust valve is tight, and so tight that even when I unscrew the
&gt; adjusting screw thingy, I still can't get the feeler gauge to slide in.

&gt;
&gt; Is this a dropped valve? ...
