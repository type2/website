&gt;  I now have a 70 Transporter with a bad sunroof. The cranking
&gt; mechanism was so bad an rusted that it came out in one piece, I would
&gt; also like to kind of make it into a camper, any suggestions?
&gt;
As far as I know, the sunroof opening on a '70 is the same as the opening
for a Westfalia pop top camper.  So, pull out the sunroof hardware and put
on a pop top.  BTW, I just happen to have one.
