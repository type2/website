As someone who grew up in the Wild West (Nevada), I learned that if you
camp at a place where you can't be easily seen, you have little to fear
from either good guys or bad guys.  Pick a 2-trail track into the boonies
and a half-mile later you have privacy!

Probably doesn't work in more urbanized regions.
