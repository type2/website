Listees:

I though you folks would like to see this clairification on the Y2K issue
from VW as it pertains to our beloved cars and vans.  As I received it at
work and am a member of the list at home, this message looks like it is
posted from a non list member, but it really isn't.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for contacting the Volkswagen Website.   We appreciate your
&gt; suggestion, and it has been documented.   All VW Electronic Control
&gt; Modules
&gt; are year 2000 compliant since their software is independent of date.   
&gt; 
&gt; The year 2000 problem is created when the computer date clock changes from
&gt; 1999-2000.  Most computers use the last two digits of the date to
&gt; determine
&gt; the year.  00 in non compliant software refers to the year 1900.  Since
&gt; our
&gt; computers do not have a computer date clock this phenomenon will not
&gt; effect
&gt; our systems.
&gt; 
&gt; We do appreciate your interest !  Please visit again soon!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sharon

&gt; &gt; Comments:    We, the owners of millions of VWs, need a quick and easy
&gt; way
&gt; &gt; to check on the Y2K compliancy of our cars.  The web is certainly a good
&gt; &gt; place to start.  So how about a search engine to do so?
