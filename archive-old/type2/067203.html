Markus Benne asked:
&gt;
&gt;So now the question is, what does the fuel shutoff valve do?  I know it
&gt;designed to
&gt;prevent diselling, but I thought it was supposed to prevent the car from
&gt;running
&gt;altogether?!?!
&gt;
The fuel cut-off valve shuts the fuel supply to the idle jet, preventing
the car from &quot;running on&quot; or dieseling after being switched off. It only
cuts the idle fuel supply, not the supply to the main jets, which is why
you can drive without it but the car keeps cutting out when you take your
foot off the gas.
