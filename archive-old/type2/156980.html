&gt; Glad someone mentioned the parking brake- I did in the past tighten the

How many months do you have?  That lip might be a sixteenth high!

Better to concentrate on freeing up the adjusters.  Penetrating oil,
taptaptap, perhaps a a bit of heat from a propane torch...

Do the adjusters turn a little, then lock up?  Put the penetrating oil on
the threads.  Completely stuck with no motion?  Put the penetrating oil on
the opposite side of the star from the threads.  Put an old screwdriver
between the teeth of the star either a little above or below center and
whack at it with a hammer to try and get some motion.

You might also undo the brake line and brake cylinder bolt and get
some looseness to pull the
drum off.  Never done that, but if you can get the cylinder through the
big hole you might be able to push it downward on one side, up on the
other side and free up the shoes when the cylinder drops to the hub
