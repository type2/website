Subject: Re: [T2] Broken fuel pump!

Before running that new pump from what you described i would first 
manually turn the engine to get the maximum  exposure for the push rod.  
then measure that height for approx 1/2 inch exposure.  If it is higher 
than that you will destroy another pump.  and as the pump is already at 
max..no fuel out.

&gt; car was bent, and considerably longer then the one I
&gt; got from RMMW.
