Janyce &amp; Bill are in NC.  We just purchased some 2&quot; fiberglass insulation
w/foil on one side, to insulate our camper van.  Had to buy it in a roll
of 4'x75' and have lots left over.  If anyone needs or wants some p-mail
us.  If you are in the Durham-Chapel Hill-Raleigh-Cary etc. area, I can
even deliver it to you.  Hate to just keep it around until I decide one
day to take it to the landfill, if someone can use it.
