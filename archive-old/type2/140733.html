Subject: Fw: [T2] unclear symptoms

I just went through this- pull the terminal from the ignition switch off the
starter motor, put a volt meter on it and have someone turn the key to
start. See how many volts are coming through that wire. It should be damn
close to 12, if not it may not be enough to start your bus.  Mine is firing
up like crazy now, it was a POS before.


I measured the voltage the stock wire was delivering to the starter motor-
it was 6 volts. I was getting 12 at the ignition switch. I cut the stock
wire out and ran a brand new 12 gauge red wire from front to back, soldering
all connections.. New crimp on terminal on to the starter motor and vroom!
Starter works like Jack the Bear, with the key for a change.
For those having starter problems, I'd have a careful look at this before
installing a hot start relay.  Old, corroded wires aren't going to work very
well. This is with a newly rebuilt starter motor too.

This past summer I have been experiencing problems starting the bus after
driving it for a while. I changed the ground cable to the battery and the
cable to the starter. It seemed to fix the problem but it came back after a
month or so.

I would go wiggle the cables, wiggle the cables at the starter/selenoid, hit
the selenoid and starter with a wrench and vrrooom vroom it would start up.
Never the same order or anything but it would go.

Yesterday it happened twice, today once.
The last time I didn't do anything to the bus but tried it after 4 minutes
and it started.
What does this sound like, ignition switch faulty? hot start problem? Sticky
starter, dying selenoid?
I've been through muir's and just not sure what to do or in what order
really.

Thoughts?
