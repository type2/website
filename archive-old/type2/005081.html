78 is different. You have to remove the screws on both sides.
Don't know which year they changed but my 73 and 78 definitely take different
hinges.

&gt; If it's the same as a '78, you just remove the hinge screws (under the seal)
&gt; and it comes right off.  If I remember rightly, you only have to take one
&gt; side off.  The stay that holds it up is so easy to get off I can't remember
&gt; how I did it.  I do remember taking it off completely.  Installation is the
&gt; reverse of removal :)
