Subject: Auxilliary Gasoline Heater

Hi Folks,

Anyone know about the operation of the extra gasoline
heater that was an option on some VW vans?  For
example is it safe enough to leave running all night
while you are sleeping?  I think this was the
Eberspachter (sp?) unit.  Is it a nightmare to
maintain?

Rob
