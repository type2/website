Subject: Re: [T2] Bus paint jobs

Hi Michael,

That's about how it went when it came time to paint the westfakia. My 
brother's next door neighbour owns a local Maaco and had already agreed 
to give me a good price. I bought the middle-price package for $375cdn. 
  At first the guy balked due to the amount of paint required to paint a 
van, but when I reminded him that there was no roof to be painted on it 
he came around.

The prep is the most important part of a paint job, and Maaco will do 
as little prep as possible in order to turn a quick buck. I did almost 
everything... pulling the windows and door-handles, bumpers and door 
rubber. It made a huge difference in the end result, even if I did have 
to have the bus towed to and from the paint shop.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; didn't want any bodywork, just paint.
