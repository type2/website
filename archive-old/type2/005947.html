Subject: What sort of camper is this?

Hi Volks:
I was at the local wrecking yard last Sunday and they have three of the following type campers:

1) Loaf, somewhere between '68 and '79 (I determined this from windshield, etc.)
2) Camper, but NOT a Westfalia conversion
3) Camper portion, which is about 3/4 of the total length of the bus, pops straight up at each corner for a fully extended height of approximately 3 feet
4) The &quot;bed&quot; is the roof, and is composed of fitted together rectangles that are padded (similar to a Devon I saw last year in San Jose); I suppose you just get up there somehow and then fill in the roof (hole) with the padded panels and then sleep on them
5) I could find no identifying marks on the fiberglass pop top

I've never seen this type camper before, not that I've spent a lot of time looking at them, but the poptop is vastly different from my '72 Westy.  They must be somewhat common though, as there were three in the same wrecking lot at the same time - all with their tops popped up.

Anyone know what these are?

Thanks
