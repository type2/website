Those are crimped metal. You can grind away the seam to get them apart, but 
I know of no way to recrimp them. There are three forms of failure. The 
diaphram leaks, the metal disc gets worn or the spring breaks. These were 
not designed to be serviceable. The skills and efforts required to develop 
a process of servicing them would vastly exceed the cost of a new part.
