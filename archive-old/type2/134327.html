Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Head mods

Richard,

My amateur opinion is that I would not leave them out as the surface they 
provide for the wavy/spring washer to work against would be eliminated. The 
wavy washer would then work against the hairpin which seems wrong.

If they were left off at all points possibly AVP has an explanation.

&gt; How critical are the thrust washers on the rocker shaft? They are item #12 
&gt; in the fiche (solid lifter head):

&gt; I just noticed that AVP left them off the rebuilt heads.
