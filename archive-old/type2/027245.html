Subject: steering coupling flange revisited- the good and the bad

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Y'all may recall I posted a week or so ago about what appeared to be a large 
crack in my steering coupling flange.  I described it as &quot;a very large crack 
(1/2 cm wide- I could see the bolt through it)&quot; and a few of you assured me 
it is accessible without removing the steering box.  I ordered a new flange, 
flexible disc and bolts from bus-boys for a very reasonable price and 
received them in less than 4 business days!

Imagine my surprise when I look at the new flange and see the &quot;large crack&quot; 
is part of the design! I feel like a dope!  the crack almost looked too 
large and perfect to be a crack, but none of the pictures I saw in Bentley 
showed the separation (and nobody corrected me otherwise). I thought it was 
something splined (?) onto the worm spindle of the steering gear box, like 
CVs, and wouldn't have a large separation. Doh! I'll replace it anyway and 
replace the old flexible disc that is likely in bad shape.

Hats off to Bus-boys_dot_com who were really helpful on the phone (might even 
have been a toll free call) and parts arrived very quickly (before parts 
ordered a week earlier from another vendor).

Safely steering,
Patrick
