&lt;&lt; Alas, it's $85 a gallon and it would've taken me a week and  a half to get

it. I've already been sitting in primer for a week and want to finish this

project.  The paint I found was called EASYPOXY, available from WestMarine

(store name, not company). There were about 20 colors.

Try and get a brand name on that paint...A buddy of mine has a boat and
looks at the WestMarine catalog first to find out what he needs, then does
a search for the same &quot;stuff&quot; at non-boating prices...In general, although
WestMarine carries quality &quot;stuff&quot;, I found their pricing to be masochistic:-(
