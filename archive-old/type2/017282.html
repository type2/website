&gt; I think its only supposed to work in a limited way (at least mine does).
&gt; 
&gt; If the door is unlocked (ie. by the key from outside), you can lock it from
&gt; the inside with the slider. And then unlock from inside, but I don;t think
&gt; from outside!
&gt; 
&gt; So, its like an internal bolt thing
&gt; 
&gt; I never use mine

Oly, Paul:
I'm sure Paul's right, the lock on the inside and the one on the outside
are completely independent of each other. This all changed in 74, (along
with the elimination of the door over the gas fill cap) to the modern
style where the key and the knob both do the same thing.
Just part of the charm of an old-timer!
