Well, I'm pretty fortunate, Mark. I do the run between my house and Ken's several times. It's a little over a mile with 45 MPH speed limit, but I'm only going up to 55 breifly, so I go for it. Part of the road there is 4 lane; part is 2 lane. On the 2 lane I only get it up to 45 because it's a 35 mph zone. If I were in an area where these speeds weren't possible, I'd try to plan some stop and do on back (neighborhood) roads. Plan a lower traffic time, like 3:00 AM, if that's feasible.

If anyone gets stuck behind you, you are GOING TO upset them. Just plan on it. Once you've driven your engine 20 miles, you don't have this opportunity again; it's broke in. The wear patterns/trends are established.

Keep in mind, this is an ideal scenario. This is also something few people do...and their buses run. The difference is, as I recall, that establishing the wear pattern over the range gives your engine a little more horsepower and longevity. The horsepower is negligible (like 1-2 HP), but it's free. The longevity, on the other hand, could mean an extra 10 or 20,000 miles on the engine...and parts that remain within spec longer.

Also please keep in mind that I'm not a real mechanic. I'm a hobbiest. I've cobbled this breakin process together through reading Wilson and Hoover and tips through the list (I think it was Eddie Hintz who did the multiple valve lash measurements; that made a lot of sense to me).

Thanks! Joe

&gt;&gt;4. Run engine for 5-10 miles doing the drive up to 55; then wind
&gt;&gt;(down-shift) do wn to 20 mph...at least 5 times...as many as 10. .
&gt;
&gt;Joe,
&gt;
&gt;I know this sounds like the dumbest question of all time. But where do 
&gt;you do this? What conditions? The only thing I can think of is to get on 
&gt;and off the freeway about 10 ten times. But that would require a lot of 
&gt;idling in between each set. Don't say &quot;country road;&quot; by the time I would 
&gt;get the bus to a country road, it would already be broken in.
&gt;
