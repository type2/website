Ed,

I do have the charcoal canister and vent lines but I have never 
touched them so can't advise you as to their necessity.

Another trap for newbies with weber icts is in synchronising them at 
idle. If you use one of the &quot;snail&quot; type air flow meters you need an 
adapter to fit over the weber ict throat. This is because the idle 
air passes down that walled off section on one side of the throat 
whereas without the adapter the &quot;snail&quot; air flow meter only fits into 
the main throat section! :( This problem only dawned on me late in the piece.

I hope you have more luck with the weber icts than I did. I never got 
them going properly though I know that others have. Mine were 
secondhand and I'm sure that there is some changed or worn part or 
blocked internal passage that is causing me grief.

Martin.

&gt;Martin,
&gt;   I m using ICT34's so your info is just what I needed.  The big 
&gt; lines are on the manifolds, not the carbs.

&gt;Do you have the charcol canister and vent lines for the fuel system? 
&gt;I was told I should have those as well.
