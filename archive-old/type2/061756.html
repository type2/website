Subject: Larrys Offroad. Opinions?

Seeing as we are spending so much time talking about MSHP,
how about another vendor?

Larrys Offroad seems to have been around for a while
and offers almost all of the engine parts I need
for the next '71 DP rebuild that I am doing.
Prices are good, they take all of my credit cards
(Ill need to use a few) and they seem like 
straight shooters.

I value the list concensus, and would like to hear
from anyone with direct experience with Larrys.

Thanx.
