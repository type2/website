&gt; I think that's what the van was originally bought for and the rest of
the cost was the coversion. The engine alone probably cost the $5k figure.

Which is sad, since about 1/2 that figure would drop in a stock 2.5l
Subaru that makes 35 more horsepower.

This was a complete stripdown and rebuild with a rare drivetrain and many
exotic parts.  A synchro had to give its all to provide the drivetrain, so
that is at least two vanagons, one rare.

Cool?  Yes.  Worth it?  Perhaps if you had $70K you didn't care about!
