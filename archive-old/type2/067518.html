Subject: 67 camper FS in Austin TX

Well, I finally got a chance to check out this camper I mentioned last
week... is NOT a Dormobile.
What it IS is a fairly nice 67 panel van converted to a camper, although I
could be wrong about that.
Here are the details:
VIN #:  217099617  Engine #: AE 548288
Mcode plate:
272
426 043 080
US 2112   131383   7099617
Paint - Perlweis L 87
The poptop is one O them small square ones, manufactured by Travel
Equipment Corp from somewhere in Indiana I think. The windows are the kind
with the BIG bolts holding them in, which is what makes me think
&quot;aftermarket.&quot; The window on the driver's side  has a large center glass,
and is stamped &quot;Hehr L 2592A 137 577&quot;  The nicest thing I saw was a
Volkswagen/Stewart Warner heater, in PRISTINE shape! (model # 8335-12). The
guy said he never ran it.The bed was down, but the upholstery seemed to be
a saltandpepper plasticy material that was in mint condition. He said it
was original. Ther is almost no rust - some rocker rot, floorboards seemed
OK. Bad stuff- really mangled driver door, bent rear bumper brackets, what
we believe to be a dropped valve, and NO 4th gear. Bus came from Oregon.
Anyone recognize it?
The guy *really* doesn't want to sell it, but you know how that goes. He
was talking about trading it for a mountain bike to get to work with!! What
I would like to do is 1) find some info for him, so he can get a fair price
(my buddy Lewis says &quot; he'd sell it to you for $400... if you had no soul&quot;)
and 2) maybe find him a buyer on here that makes him feel better about
parting with it. Any help on either?
