Subject: Re: [T2] Dead VW

From: &quot;Stan Brown&quot; &lt;browns4s_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Just saw the headline &quot;Bombing at UN's Iraq HQ&quot; on www.msn_dot_com and saw a
yellow/green VW Bug in the rubble.  It looked like it could still run but on
the lighter side at least it wasn't a Bus.

It's been in most of the video shown on the cable network news feeds.  From
what I could see, it looks like it caught at least some of the blast.
