 79 Westy???

IMHO, it's easier to remove them as a unit.  As for necessity... I've
done it both ways on a standard and I've done it both ways on a vanagon
auto.  Never on a loaf auto.

&gt; My Haynes says I have to remove the 090 auto tranny and engine as a unit in
&gt; my 79 Westy. It seems to contradict itself, as the supplement at the back of
&gt; the book says the 090 has to come out together with engine, yet earlier in
&gt; the book it says if you're concerned about weight, remove the engine first.
&gt; Has anyone got any experience with this?
&gt; Thanks again,
