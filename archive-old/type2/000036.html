 &gt; All this discussion of HEAT has prompted me to improve the heat in
 &gt; Bleu.  So, what are you all using for a main heater duct (from the 'Y'
 &gt; pipe at the rear to the diverter valve in the front)?  I've searched
 &gt; locally and the best that I've found is either 3 or 4 inch dryer duct.
 &gt; Plastic...  Not exactly what I had in mind.  Is the stock paper/tin foil
 &gt; pipe available?  (Ron?)
 Jim:
 The original pipe is mild steel sheet, just like the rest of the type 2.
 It's covered with a thin quilted insulation blanket that's vinyl on the
 outside to keep it from absorbing water. These parts have typically been
 gone from the vehicles I've driven for 10-15 years by now. I've tried
 welding straight exhaust pipe(from your friendly local muffler
 shop-FLMS) back in the opening, but by far the simplest, most satisfying
 fix(for me) is 2&quot; PVC DWV pipe for 68-72 and 3&quot; for the later loafs. &gt;&gt;


I found vent pipe for natural gas water heaters that fit.  It is double 
walled and easily welded in place.  I insulated it with closed cell foam that 
had foil bonded to the outside.  Seems to work well and has held up for over 
a year with no deterioration.
