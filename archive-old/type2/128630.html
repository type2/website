Subject: Front door vapor barrier (was Stuck Drivers window)

&gt;It's very important to reinstall the plastic barrier or to replace it with
&gt;new plastic if the old plastic is shot. Be sure that the plastic slips down
&gt;inside the door opening like the stock plastic does. The inside of the door
&gt;is a surprisingly wet place. It's not just vapor that is the problem. Water
&gt;actually drips in there during a heavy rain (even with new window seals).  ...

Before you glue the new plastic in place, take the time to clear
the drains at the bottom of the doors.  Pine needles, leaves and
other debris find their way down there.  The drains clog up and
water collects.  Left unchecked, this can lead to cancer (rust).
