Subject: Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control (Group Bus Painting)

I really can't tell if you guys are just spinning your wheels, or if you 
are serious....but I would drive for two days to attend such a session. I 
have been working on my 76 Westy for 3 years, getting it ready to paint, 
and  the last step is finding a painter to do the last few coats.  I think 
it is called sage green....the standard green for 1976.

Count me in if this is anything other than a pipe dream.

 &gt; Hey when we having this painting festival???
name the time and place, Mid Atlantic area please.....I'll bring the beer,
my air compressor and anything else, it is such a bear of a job and it is
a lot easier to just get each person to do a &quot;part&quot; of the job, guy #1
does all the prep, #2 does all the primer #3 does all the coating etc. bet
it would make one heck of a weekend project for a half dozen buses or
so...

 &gt; Wouldn't be a bad idea seriously - for a half dozen bus folks to get 
together and paint a bunch of busses together at one time. Prob work really 
good for driver buses. Those show guys are a bit pickier of course!!! &lt;grin!&gt;
