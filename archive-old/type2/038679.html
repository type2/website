Subject: A couple of apologies

Man did I ever stir up the list! There are two things tied for firs on the 
list of &quot;the last things I wanted to do&quot; with my original new bus nightmare 
posting. One, was to divide the list into having people take sides, and the 
other was to make it sound like the seller was intentionally misleading me. I 
am apologizing to all, and I want to thank ALL of you who responded.  Finding 
this site on the net a few weeks after getting my computer  was the main 
thing that made me go ahead and act on what has literally been a 24 year 
wish, and that was to get a bus. I have been amazed with the helpful nature 
and the camaraderie here, and I want it to stay that way. I hope to both get 
helpful information, and amuse you with my dumb questions for years to come !
As to the seller, I also apologize. I went back and read my posting, and 
although my ONLY intent was to get some advice about what you folks think is 
fair, it didn't sound that way. It was my knowing that I was too emotional 
about all of this that made me want other opinions, but it was also that same 
emotion that colored the tone of my original posting; hence the apology. I 
also would have never have asked for advice this early in this ordeal if I 
thought he had to be concerned over anyone knowing who he is. I purposefully 
didn't say names, and I thought that was discreet enough, if not I apologize 
for that as well.
I'll close by saying that I don't think I was intentionally mislead. I DO 
KNOW what &quot;as is&quot; means and have sold cars as well as boats this way. But I 
put a lot of effort into finding the right bus, I paid what I feel was on the 
high end of the price range, (and the buy sell list confirms this) and to 
have it do this 80 miles into my ownership of a total rebuild with 2k miles 
on it, was just more than I could deal with when I originally posted. I hope 
he and I can work this out amicably,and both have the karma that should go 
with the bus ownership. It may sound silly, but a big part of what attracted 
me to this bus was knowing a little about all of it's owners (I'm the 
fourth), and to have sour memories of how we got to each other in the first 
place would be too bad. Contrary to how my posting may have sounded, I do 
believe it is important to them that this bus they obviously put a lot of 
time into end up with the right person, so I hope that's still achievable.
Thanks again to all of you.
