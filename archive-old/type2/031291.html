&gt; Has anyone installed one of the Carver Model P4 Proane/Butane heaters?
&gt; I found one for $700.  

for about $700 you can get a brand new Webasto air to air cab heater, very
small, very powerfull and very safe, designed for the truckers to keep
their sleeper cabs warm without having to keep thier big engines running,
avaliable in Gas and Diesel versions
