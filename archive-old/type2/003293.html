&gt; Volks:
&gt;
&gt; As vulgar as the subject sounds, I curious about the size of the fuel
&gt; outlet from the fuel tank on FI busses.  I'm converting from a
&gt; carburated to FI engine.  Currently I have 10mm(?/stock carb size)
&gt; connecting to a 3/8&quot; tee.  One outlet to the fuel pump and one outlet
&gt; receiving the return fuel line.  As the engine reaches operating
&gt; temperature, fuel pressure drops to 0/zilch psi.  I think the smaller
&gt; line at the tank is what is causing my fuel starvation problem. So, my
&gt; questions are:
&gt;
&gt; 1) What size fuel line comes out of a FI fuel tank?
&gt;
&gt; 2) If this fuel line is larger than 10mm would it fit my tank?

Both in and out are 7mm on a FI bus tank. The only 10mm section is between
the filter and pump and is about 4'' long.
