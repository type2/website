Subject: Speedo swap out in '71 Westy

My speedometer shows 10 mph faster than I'm actually traveling.  Is swaping
the speedometer out with a used one from the junk yard very difficult?  How
do I make the new/used odometer match my original miles?  Is it better and or
safer to take my old speedo to a speedometer specialist (United Speedometer
is only a few miles away) and have it re-calibrated or will they just say
yep...you need a new one?

I know somebody must have had this problem before...yes/no?
