To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi,
I have a major oil leak going on and since I was out
of town, a friend looked underneath and told me he
thought it was coming from the differential...

I'm really new at this, but in looking at the weir
book, i couldn't see where oil was really involved in
the differential...besides thicker, grease oil...

any advice on this?
