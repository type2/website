Hello ALL!

Upon the realization that there were no Full Moon Bus Club campouts during
the month of August, on
a FULL MOON weekend, your friendly, local TN members have been planning
away! We've spent many
hours from many days finding a spot that we feel would be a suitable camping
location for this
August and, hopefully, many Augusts to come.

We feel that we have finally found just such a spot, and want to invite ANY
and ALL to join us for
BUSES ON THE RIVER!

We would like to invite ALL of our Full Moon buddies, our other club members
(the Good Ole Volks),
as well as ANY other VW enthusiast to this event.

We will be camping alongside the Nolichucky River, at the Nolichucky Gorge
Campground in Erwin,
TN. This campground was built by many rafters, kayakers, and hikers hours of
fruitful volunteer
efforts. It is positioned within one of the deepest gorges in the entire
Southeast, and has great
water accessibility, not to mention literally bordering the National Forest
and the Appalachian
Trail. All beverages and all dogs are WELCOME within the campground, so it
will be perfect for us!
At only an hour's drive from Asheville and just 2 hours from Knoxville, it
makes for the PERFECT
TENNESSEE camping experience!

If you're into mountain biking, watersports, hiking, eating, fishing, or
just plain doing nothing,
then this is the campout for you. The middle of August will be hot, but the
water will be cool and
the pines that we will be camping under should provide with ample shade.
Experience August as it
ought to be experienced... with your VW friends, under a full moon, at the
Buses On The River
campout!

Here's the website link... CHECK IT OUT!!
http://www.geocities_dot_com/goodolevolk/busriver.html  The
Food list page is going to be updated repeatedly, as everyone confirms their
spots.  We will be
doing a Breakfast Burrito meal for Saturday morning, and will be planning a
Saturday evening meal,
as well.  Keep checking back to the page for updates!

For any questions, updates, or to sign up for the food list, and so on...
don't be afraid to email
