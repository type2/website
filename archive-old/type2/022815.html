My '74 has that really cool blue/green plaid.  You can also find this on some 
'75 Westies as well.

Anyway, at a campout this spring, a bus guy I know from KC shows up with a 
whole roll of brand new blue/green plaid he bought at a junk shop or like 15 
cents or something.  It looked like enough fabric to redo the whole bus.

He wasn't ready to part with it, but maybe the next time I see him.

BBTA maybe?
