&gt; Check the archives. Hoover actually did work on this a few years
&gt; ago, but felt it was too much of a PITA to be practical. This may have
&gt; changed. I just searched on &quot;veeduber propane&quot; and found one of his
&gt; posts, a few more creative searches should yield more info...

From what I've heard, Hoover's propane engine has been consigned to the
Backyard of Good Intentions. Try Zamboni. No kidding. (Their website is
http://www.zamboni_dot_com) Zamboni used to build its ice resurfacing machines
with aircooled VW power, and Zambonis don't wear out so parts would have to
still be available.
