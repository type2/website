Subject: [T2] 2 vanagons/ repeating 

I'm repeating this post just so no one misses it...I guess I'll repeat it
again some time in the near future
please post me if you have any iterest in these items..

I have a couple of project vans to dispose of
1. 1980 Westy.  Moderate rust and a few dents.  Engine would run but leaks
about a quart every hundred.  Has complete FI equipment but has non standard
exhaust system..ie..no catalytic converter.  I was driving it around when I
parked it and have taken a few parts off of it, including a tail light lens
and a turn signal.

2.1983 GL non- westy.  I took engine out to fix oil leak and have put it
back in, but not hooked up anything.  Has a single progressive weber carb
and all the parts to a complete exhaust system.  Ran fine up until I took
engine out.  Comes with a two person middle seat.  Body is in great
condition.  Doesn't seem ever to have been hit.  Just a few small dimples
and almost no rust.

Some one who would want to take both could have a lot of miscellaneous spare
parts.
I'm looking to get about $1000 for each of these.
