Confirm good reports on IPD from many Volvo owners.

&gt;
&gt;Brake bleeding:

&gt;Pressure bleeder:
&gt;
&gt;A professional pressure bleeder is the   *only*   way to go if one 
&gt;bleeds brakes very often at all. They are not cheap. 

Concur, mine cost $200+.

 The pressure on the supply 
&gt;can runs ~15 - 20 psi.

I run mine at 30 psi.

&gt;Vacuum pump:
&gt;
  As noted, 
&gt;it works poorly if the bleeder isn't removed first and greased up. 
&gt;*plumber tip o' the day*:  Instead of grease, use a small amount of 
&gt;teflon thread sealer tape on the shank of the bleeder.  Works very 
&gt;well, and it can be left on until next time.   
 
Yes, if you must use vacuum, teflon tape is a great tip. If you then got
bubbles, you would know it was coming past the seals, particularly if the
old hoses were swollen and restrictive. Info aiding diagnosis, if you don't
believe the chunks of gunk coming out.
 
&gt;The metal  vacuum pump was my choice, and I still use it frequently 
&gt;for testing and sucking fluid out of various places.

The only item for testing vac. diaphrams as well. 

  IMHO, if a wheel cylinder  or any brake 
&gt;part leaks that easily, it should be repaired or replaced.  

I will add, DO pump the pedal fully regardless methode. I want to identify
any problem and induce a leak if the system is weak due to contamination,
so it can be fixed before the inevitable hazzard of no pedal. 

&gt;Getting off one's wallet for good tools is a personal decision.

Excellent synopsis on this string, Jeff.
