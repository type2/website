Sorry, I forgot the following info...Thanks for the responses so far
engine--rebuilt longblock 1600
Carbs--40mm Kadrons jetted for a 1600 by the manufacturer (sold by SoCal,
they reassured me that everything was set up for a stock 1600.  Balanced
and idle set yesterday (took about 50 tries with breaks so I didn't pass
out from the exhaust)
distributor--new bosch 009 advance
Exhaust--monza style four tip

Timing--15 degrees btdc
I started out at 5 degrees ATDC and advanced 2 degrees until She idled
smooth and accelerated fine.
Note, anything less that 15 degrees BTDC left me backfiring on the
deceleration

I have hi rev springs going in as soon as my buddy finds the adapter for
the air compressor so I don't drop a valve

Thats about all I know.  She doesn't hesitate when turning over (which
happens when timing is way advanced).

The help so far has been great.  I just wanted to clarify the previous post
so you guys could rule out a few more factors.  I've gotten responses
ranging from &quot;the carbs are too big&quot;--which they are not,  to, &quot;someone
saying he has his set at 17 degrees btdc.  

Anyone else want to chime in???  I gotta have her running smooth so I can
garage my non-VW winter beater!!!!!

Thanks
