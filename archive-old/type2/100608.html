Subject: Times they are a changeing

   It seems that years ago when nobody wanted a VW bus any more they were
taken over by the hippy cult, now as things in this country progressed they
were taken over by the yuppie cult (driving up the values and demand)and as
things continue to go on our buses seem to be taken over by the computer
geek (no offense to anyone, please). It seems that at least half of the
people I deal with for parts on their buses jobs seem to have something to
do with computers! 
   Who or WHAT will the next generation of bus owners be

ronnie  just a thought for Friday
