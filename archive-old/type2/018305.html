Hello all,

First of all, I would like to thank everyone who responded to my
previous questions concerning removing stickers, and heater box
replacements.  I think I am going to go with J-tubes for the '71,
hopefully with the Gene Berg tin someone mentioned. (I haven't contacted
GB yet.)  For the stickers, I received recommendations ranging from a
high pressure washer to WD-40.  Haven't started yet, but going to try
water and heat first, then move on to the solvents if necessary.

Secondly, as you might remember, I purchased a '72 Adventure Camper
about a month and a half ago.  My roomate and I removed the engine (1700
dual carb) and trans last Saturday get a good look at things.  This was
the first time removing an engine from a VW, and things went much easier
than I thought they would.  Well, discovered some strange stuff.

There were 3 splices in the accelerator cable!!!  For one splice, they
used a crimp on electrical connector!  (Can't believe this one.  New
cable cost me $5. Why did they bother splicing it so many times?) 
Helicoils in the oil drain plug and 2 spark plugs.  4 plastic fuel
filters!  One between tank and pump, one between pump and fire wall, one
to each carb.  Some kind of electrical fuel pump bolted to tin, but not
hooked up.  Oil all over the place.  Needs 4 new CV boots.  No electric
wiring to the carbs.  Carbs need serious cleaning/rebuilding.  Etc Etc

Well, it looks like my bargain camper just turned into a costly one. 
Definitely won't have it ready for a planned trip at the end of the
month.  I am most concerned with the helicoils.  Can I get inserts
installed without opening the engine?  I haven't opened the engine yet,
was hoping I don't have to.  At this point, I am going to keep my eye
out for another 1700 motor that I can drop in there while working on
this one.  Anyone in So Cal got an extra?

Thanks for the opportunity to vent, and any advice would be appreciated.
