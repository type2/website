&gt; [...]Both of my ACVWs exhibit the behavior described, and I usually (but not
&gt; always) find that the procedure given by George Lyle gives repeatable
&gt; results.  I think there may be something going on with surface tension  of the
&gt; oil.  If, after checking, I find the level to be low, when I expect it to be
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stick in 6 times and come up with 5 readings

I always pull it out, wipe, put it in, give a litle twist back and forth,
