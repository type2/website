&gt; So, I hop in the '78 Riviera bus yesterday a.m. to go to the
&gt; airport and she fires up, then promptly dies.  I tried a couple
&gt; of more times, and it sounds like it is being choked out.  I look
&gt; in back and all the hoses had become disconnected!  Wierd!
&gt; So why did this happen?  Also, my battery light is glowing
&gt; sometimes, and I am getting horrible gas milage (&gt;12mpg) and need
&gt; to adjust the AFM to fix that, I know.
&gt; So is this hose problem something to take note of?


Sounds like it backfired through the air flow meter. Fuel built up in the
intake and finally ignited.  I've seen this happen before.  In fact, I've
seen it literally blow the flapper door right off of the AFM!  Could have
been a one-time thing, but from your mention of the bad gas mileage I
suspect not. Sounds like you need to find out why it's running so rich.
Possible causes/solutions that come to mind are adjusting the mixture screw
on the AFM, looking for vacuum leaks (although if a significant vacuum leak
were present the pressure might have escaped from there rather than blowing
the hose off), or possibly even replacing the AFM if all else fails. There
is plenty of good FI troubleshooting info on Busted Bus, etc.
