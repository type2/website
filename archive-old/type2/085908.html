Subject: Re: [T2] Horns Again

I'd go ahead and use the relay, just to be safe.  I have a set of Hella dual 
trumpets on my bus(also a '70) and I used the relay.

BTW: Where did the name Ruptured Duck come from?  :^)



&gt;Hiya All,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in large part to Greg down in Florida I got the disconnected ground 
&gt;in
&gt;my horn reconnected.  And I've got a &quot;beep-beep&quot; now.
&gt;
&gt;While I was crawling around under the Bus I thought it might be nice to 
&gt;have
&gt;another horn over on the passenger side of the Bus.  A dual horn set-up.  I
&gt;figure a little louder, a little safer.  It seems to me that the wiring for
&gt;this would be dirt-simple.  I'd just have to splice into the existing hot
&gt;lead and ground for the horn.  Does that sound like a do-able proposition 
&gt;to
&gt;everybody?
&gt;
&gt;And then I thought about the Karmann Ghia dual horn relay.  Do I need to go
&gt;that way?  Seems to me that the draw for the horn is so small and 
&gt;infrequent
&gt;that a relay would not be needed.  Thoughts?
&gt;
