Yikes, yet another bus problem (3 in 3 days) with my '79 Westy.

Just before I arrived at work this morning my radio quit on me. Huh? says I
as I turn it on and off with no effect. Then I notice that my lights are kind 
of
dim. Crap, my battery is loosing charge. The alternator light is not on,
and my engine temp is OK so I limp into work 2 miles away. I kill the
engine, and sure enough there is not enough juice to start the bus again.

Questions:
1) Does the alternator light only come on if the alternator stops turning
    (the fan belt breaks)? Or does it actually tell you if the alternator is
   working (trying to charge the battery).

2) Since my battery is dead, this must mean that either the voltage
    regulator or alternator is bad right? (battery is only 6 months old).

3) Where is the voltage regulator on a '79 anyways?

Well, I am going to drive home on my spare battery, then get out the
books and figure out whats up.
