Subject: Re: [T2] update: please help urgent

Something i have seen on porsche engines is a holed number three jug.  
This was only when they were put into bugs and not cooled properly.  
This would definately give you the louder noise and put oil in the 
area.  But the odds of that seem slim.

&gt; I just ran out to the car to check it over.  Still have all the spark

&gt; though I had just filled it a short while ago. Don't have a compression 
&gt; checker.  Went to buy one, but they had a couple different types for 
&gt; testing different things.  Not sure which I need.
&gt; When I looked on the drivers side front of the engine (front means 
&gt; front of the car) There was a lot of oil in the compartment and the 
&gt; spark plug is all oily.
&gt; Guess I gotta find a place to bring it in to be looked at.  Wasn't 
&gt; happy with the last place I took it less than 2 weeks ago.  He was 
&gt; supposed to have done a thorough inspection, but it looks like he 
&gt; missed a couple things.  Especially since he didn't even listen to it 
&gt; run.
&gt; Don't know if the oil in the compartment helps with the diagnoses.
&gt; Thanks,
