Subject: Water Injection

VWBrain described a water injection system made
popular in Mother Earth News
http://journeytoforever_dot_org/biofuel_library/ethanol_motherearth/me3.html
I had planned for several years to add water injection
to my T4 2L by using the EGR port into the plenum
chamber. I got as far as gutting out all the internal
plumbing inside the plenum that is attached to the EGR
port. I was not interested in H2O inj at high vacuum
as the system described in the link above does. I
wanted the water to inject at high engine load only,
as my intention was to lower the peak temperatures in
freeway driving.

I investigated several pumps and had decided that a
coldstart injector linked to a windshield washer
pressureized tank might be the direction to go. The
5th injector (now 6th!) would be aimed directly into
the incoming airflow from the throttle body. It also
is a direct bolt-on to the EGR mounts.

I just never got around to doing it, and now, with the
Subey, it's just not an issue anymore. I may do
Mother's system on the Subey engine but not for the
same reasons as I would have on the T4.

Your thoughts and comments on this are most welcome -
I think it could be as important to the longevity of
FI bus motors as the adjustable mixture and quad head
temp gauges have proven. -BaH
