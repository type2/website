Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

I did something similar on my old 356 Porsche race car. I took the area 
above the engine down to bare metal. I then decided to paint it with a clear 
coat so that the rust free condition could be clearly seen and I could 
monitor any new rust. It would have been better if I had used POR-15 clear 
(I think they offer a clear). One problem would be noise transmission but 
not a problem with a race car.

 &gt;Has anyone ever painted the underside of thier van with POR-15 INSTEAD of
underseal.

 I have a dream that one day I strip the bottom of my van of all mechanical
 components, snadblast it and then paint on 2 or 3 coats of pale grey POR.
 Then I clean and re-attach the bits so it all looks smart. The theory is
 that the POR is smoother and so dirt will be easier to clean off than it is
 from the rough and rubbery underseal. The greay will make it easier to see
 down there and show rust up earlier.
