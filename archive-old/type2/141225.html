Subject: RE: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus

&gt; I like it, but I also like access to my stereo.


True, but driving and shifting while holding a cup of coffee in one hand,
because you don't have a cup holder, also makes it hard to adjust the
stereo. :-)

Actually, the cup holders themselves don't block the stereo at all, but if
you used two relatively tall cups they could. The mugs shown in the lower
picture are fairly tall coffee mugs, and also there are two of them. A soda
can, a smaller coffee cup, or even a single tall cup in the right hand
holder wouldn't block the radio much.

Of course there are other options. I sell another cup holder that can be
placed elsewhere (http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=CH100B), and
there are of course other cup holders that clip, screw, or tape to your bus,
with varying degrees of practicality.  But this one appeals to me because
you don't have to screw or tape it to your bus, it mounts securely, it puts
everything right within reach, and it's inexpensive. That's why I jumped on
it.
