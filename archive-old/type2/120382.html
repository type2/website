Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator toasted- I have one for whoever
  needed it

Hello,

I have a good working voltage regulator off of a 74
automatic bus if you want it. Donate $5 to the list
and I will send it to you. I only have one.
Just email me your address and I will have it in the
mail as soon as I can.

Thanks,
David Kelly

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Not to start a FART, but where should I pursue a
&gt; replacement? Can the
&gt; &gt;typical National FLAP supply this?
