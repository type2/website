&gt; &gt; My problem:  when I start the car in this cooler weather we are having
in
&gt; &gt; Northern Virginia, the starter does not disengage, even after the engine
&gt; &gt; catches and is running.  (Fuel Injection)

&gt;  mine has just started doing that ;8*{

Usually this is caused by the starter drive sticking to the armature shaft.
Too much gummy stuff on the shaft. A good flush with a spray penetrent
usually cleans it up.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, it does stop turning over, but only after about 3-10 seconds.  This
&gt; &gt; cannot be helping things.  Meanwhile, the engine ALWAYS catches on the
third
&gt; &gt; revolution, no mater how cold/hot
&gt;
&gt; I still can't find why mine insists on having to be cranked and cranked to
&gt; start on colder mornings.

Replace the cold start valve. It may have a plugged nozzle.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I do have an EXCELLENT, almost LIKE NEW '77 AUTOMATIC starter/solenoid
which
&gt; &gt; I would be willing to trade (Bob, do you remember??) for a MT setup.  Or
&gt; &gt; sell, for a less than comparable MT setup.
&gt;
&gt; you &quot;Should&quot; be able to use the automatic starter, in fact it is a little
&gt; more powerfull.  .8 hp vs .7 for the manual

An automatic trans starter will NOT work on a 2.0L manual engine. It will
not reach the teeth on the ring gear. It will work on a 1.7 or 1.8 manual
flywheel.


P.S.
I have changed my email address. I can still be found at aufever_at_webtv_dot_net
and aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com but I mainly use this one now.
