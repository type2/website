One time I drove 1000 miles in 21 hours. Then I got sick for a week. ;)

I show 447 people as of this morning.

Newbies, Uncle Joel is our statistician. He keeps a database of who owns
what bus and where. I figure eventually he'll know about every bus in the
US and Canada, at least, maybe Europe too. Anyway let him know what you
drive.
