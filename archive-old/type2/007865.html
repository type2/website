Subject: Lean or rich? in or out?

Someone on the list the other day mentioned the direction in which to turn
the air mixture screw on a twin solex carb setup...  was it &quot;turn clockwise
for lean&quot;?  This is on the left carb on a 72 1700cc motor...  The Follys!  I
now know I really screwed up and thought the air mixture was the idle speed
screw.  I know... Stoopid!

But that super rich set up might explain the gas in the oil!

Barry!
