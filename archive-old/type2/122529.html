&gt; I'd prefer another style of screw that either of those two. Any
&gt; recomendations?
&gt; 

i like the original phillips screws also, although i have searched far and
wide for an exact replacement and i cannot find one. we have good ones, but
they do not have the thread cutting feature - the &quot;notch&quot; in the end. those
are not available with a P3 head in my searches.

as long as you are not dealing with screws that have been sitting for 10
years or more, they work perfectly. also make sure to have the right size
driver, which is P3, the big one. i have a big driver with a hex shank, you
can put a 13mm spanner on the shank and turn that baby really hard while
pushing hard on the handle to get the stubborn screws loosened.

if you want a more positive screw, then use hex socket cap screws, aka
&quot;allen head&quot; screws.
