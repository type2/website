&gt;Subject: Stalling on starting corrected!!!

&gt;I fixed my problem with my '77 westy stalling when it was started cold.
&gt;It would start right up and then die almost immediately.  I would have to
&gt;give it gas to keep it running.  I believe someone mentioned it might be an
&gt;air leak.  Well I found a cracked hose, taped it up good with duct tape,
&gt;and my problem is solved.  It starts up to a smooth idle everytime.
&gt;I believe someone else out there had a similar problem?  If you read
&gt;this, check your hoses, that may be your only problem.

Brett: Glad to hear you got it fixed. I was suprised how many people 
      mailed me with detailed explainations on why my air leak theory was
     totally wrong. Several novel explainations of how the system works;-)
