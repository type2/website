&gt;Hi, I am new to the list, and I am currently totally restoring a 75 Westy. 
&gt;I removed the fuel tank and re an re'd it, but I can't understand how to get 
&gt;the new rubber filler at the entry point for fuel filling connection into 
&gt;place.  Is it shoved from the outside in, or from the inside out?

Install the new rubber filler neck on the metal pipe and pull the flange on the rubber neck through from the inside to the outside.

Then attach the rubber section at the end of the pipe to the fuel tank with clamps. You should also clamp the fuel filler neck which is more easily done before you thread it through so try to get the orientation of the filler neck to the pipe correct because tightening that clamp is no fun either.
