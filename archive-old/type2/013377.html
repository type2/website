 &gt;The book seems to be a great how-to guide for the various repairs discussed 
&gt;but I'm beginning to think that the things that are Muir's opinion need to 
&gt;be taken with a grain (or two) of salt. what's the verdict?

Man, everybody's opinion needs to be take with a grain of salt. I
thought you knew that. =^ )

Muir's job is not to be accurate; Muir's job is to make you WANT to work
on engines. Muir, Pirsig and Hoover are the only three writers who have
ever done that for me. Considering the vast canon of automotive
technical literature, it would appear to be a very rare and wonderful
talent to be able to do that.

So I don't think it's best to hold Muir to the highest standards of
veracity. That's not what it's there for. Muir is doing what *he* set
out to do so wonderfully that he will probably never be equalled. If
you want technically accurate, get Bentley or somebody dry like that.
