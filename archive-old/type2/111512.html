Subject: Re: [T2] HCBF ariel photo

you are correct ted... i am planning on ordering them myself not a bad deal at all ...
they are really nice looking pics..
glad you got yours ted....
buddah went all out on a really great idea...
to think we can hang them on the wall and say that was a really good time...
another awesome memory on the wall...
you can see a numerous amount of the bus's that were there ...
175 bus's i think is what we ended up and had at High Country from what i understand one of the biggest camp outs volks have seen...

get um while you can they are worth it...

&gt;Hi Volks, just got my 11x17 ariel photo of HCBF. It is wonderful-the detail
&gt;is terrific and I can even see my bus and can point to where I am in the
&gt;&quot;people VW&quot;.  If you want to save a great memory of this wonderful event, I
&gt;would recommend that you order one immediately. TBear
