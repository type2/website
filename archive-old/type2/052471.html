&gt; It appears to be a discussion of the placement of the oil temp sensor. VDO
&gt;  sells a sensor that replaces the plug in the pressure relief valve. This
&gt;  places the wire out of harms way. It reads oil temps as it is passing by, 
no
&gt;  question of stagnant pools. This area also measures the theoretically
&gt;  warmest oil as it has not reached the cooler yet.

A few years ago I had a CHT and an oil temp sender that replaces the plug in 
the pressure relief valve hooked up at the same time.  The sender for the CHT 
was attached under a head stud nut.  They read the exact same temp during all 
phases of engine warm-up cool-down.
The moral of my experience is: if you want to read the case temp use the 
sender that replaces the plug for the pressure relief valve and place your 
head temp sender under a head stud.  If you want to read oil temp use the dip 
stick sender (I'm not sure how well this will work on a type IV however) or 
thermally insulate your oil temp sender from the case.  For the CHT sender 
either place the sender under the spark plug (be sure you get a good seal) or 
some other location similar to the spark plug location, e.g. not under a head 
nut (the studs act as heat sinks) and not right on the exhaust port.
One more thing, VDO gauges are extremely inaccurate.  I just bought a 
replacement for my dip stick sender and when I checked its accuracy it was 
reading 30 degrees too low at 250 degrees.  I also just installed a CHT gauge 
in my sons bug a few weeks ago and when I checked it's accuracy it was 
reading 35 degrees too low at 350 degrees.  When I checked accuracy of the 
CHT gauge I installed on my '79 Adventurewagen it read 50 degrees too low at 
350 degrees.
I've made this offer to people on the list a number of times and nobody has 
ever taken me up on it, but if you want me to check the accuracy of your temp 
gauge send it to me, pay postage both ways and I'll do it for free.
