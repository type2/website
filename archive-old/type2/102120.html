Subject: A revision of a brief question...

Yesterday I asked about the time it would take for the head gaskets to 
be replaced on my '78 bus;  I  am greatful for the replies but several 
people asked the pertinent question, &quot;why do you think this needs to be 
done anyway?&quot;  Someone who professes to know VW busses told me my 'heads 
are popping&quot; and that I need the gaskets replaced.  The symptom is that 
I do get a popping noise if  I rev the engine really hard (normally I 
don't hear this noise, and normally I don't rev my engine like that!)  I 
looked in my Muir book and found something about loose heads, but as I 
am pretty ignorant (obviously) I figured I would ask you guys. Thanks 
again.  Beth in NJ
