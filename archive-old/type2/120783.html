Subject: Re: [T2] How do you know all this

Hello Vincent  Could be like me working on them since I was 9 years old, 
rebuilt first motor when I was 14 , Rumor has it instead of a silver spoon I was 
born with a snap-on 13 mm wrench :)   This list is great for any problem you 
could have with your bus  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
