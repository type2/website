yes, I have seen this. I have 2 sets of pertronix one in my 79 and one
in my 66. While I haven't swapped the units around just to see, my 66
which is carb measures only 42-43 degrees, the thing runs like a top
though. no problems with the ignition. On my 79 I saw over 50 (IIRC
53), this is a FI engine. I therorize that either my two units are
different or the FI is actually causing an error in measuring dwell.
One of these days I'll swap them to try for real, but I would not
worry.
