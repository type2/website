In a message dated 96-10-02 00:20:52 EDT, you write:

&gt;What I would like to do is ask all of you who do vacuum reading as part of
&gt;your normal maintainance to let me know the following:
&gt;
&gt;vacuum guage reading,
&gt;miles on engine,
&gt;engine displacement,
&gt;original/ rebuilt engine.
&gt;
&gt;

Steve,

Naturally I ran right out to check and indeed the reading is 15&quot;hg( &quot;inches
of mercury&quot; per the book rather than the opposite psi). This is an 81 with
107k and 3k on a topend rebuild.

The manual for the &quot;Mityvac&quot; that I use says 16 to 22 is normal for a gas
engine with less than that described as inefficient. It goes on to describe a
steady reading of 15 as due to either late timing or an intake manifold leak.

I'll be interested in the definitive answer on this one.

Weston
