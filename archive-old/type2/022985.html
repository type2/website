&gt;If so, and if you have a digital camera, I am dying to know where this idler
&gt;pulley assembly goes.  The PO removed it to put new bearings in, and never
&gt;reinstalled it or the a/c compressor, thus my current situation!

I don't understand your question.  Are you talking about a type4-powered 
bus?  A type 4 car (hopefully not since this is a bus list)?  The bus 
installation has no idler pulley for the A/C.  If your bracket has an idler 
pulley attached, it did not originally come from a bus.  My '73 Capri had 
such a pulley though.
