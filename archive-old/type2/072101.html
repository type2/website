Subject: Re: [T2] Autoclub?

AAA is where its at if your going to tow the bus alot. if not for them i
wouldn't have my bus:

on a trip from oregon to san francisco i broke down right after the the
fell street ramp in the middle of the intersection on octavia street. from
there, AAA towed me to no less than eight times going from mechanic to
mechanic in the city and the east bay. i got an opinion, and a second
opinion, and a third, and on and on until i heard the right one. but i
never did hear the right one. they all said &quot;new engine, bub&quot;. even before
the year two thousand i was asking why2k? i found a beetle engine shade
tree mechanic who performed top end surgery, and one or two more tow rides
to zip up the operation - fuel injection stuff, etc.

eventually i limped home and stowed the rig on a friend's farm for eighteen
months! then i found the type2 list, and haven't been towed once. ditched
AAA and now i have greasy fingers, shabby clothes, the right deal. if i
absolutely need a tow, i get a few a year with my car insurance at no
additional charge. odd thing in all this is that none of the california
tows made their way to my oregon AAA record. ain't dat sumptin'?
