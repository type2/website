Subject: Gas Heater Plumbing

Do any of you know whether to connect the gas line 
for a gas heater in a '75 Bus to the low pressure 
side or the high pressure side of the electrical 
gas pump?  I tee'd it into the low pressure side, 
and see no fuel in the line, but hesitate to hook 
it to the HP side lest I inadvertenly make a small 
roaster-on-wheels.
