Load all the pieces into a friends vehicle.  Drive to a self serve car wash that
has an engine degreaser choice.  Spray every thing with the degreaser, have a
soda or other beverage for 10 - 15 minutes.  Use the high pressure soap spray to
blast off the crud. High pressure rinse to ---rinse.   If the car wash has the
degreaser, they should also have some sort of filter system and means of
disposal of the gunk.

I do the engine trans suspension, and under carriage on the bus on a regular
basis.  Allows me to spot leaks and when I work on the bus, I don't become a
grease monkey.  Do not linger too long on the distributor cap, or cover with a
baggy and rubber band. Let the engine cool some before starting.  Hey, we
wouldn't be driving busses if we didn't have the time.  Do not spray the
alternator or generator with the engine running.  Be ready to check for hoses
blown loose, probably time for replacement if they do.  Have paper towels to dry
out the distributor cap and points if necessary.

Most of all, wear grungy clothes, eye protection and don't smile with a toothy
grin, as I guarantee the spray will get you.

Keep smiling,

Mike
