Ok.  Now to clear this up.  Now that I have it narrowed down to 2 engines 
which one is better for my application.  This bus is going to be a bus that 
goes around town a few times a week, on the highway very little, and the bus 
is going to be looking very good.  Partially for show.  In other words it 
won't be running that much.  If it goes any were it will probably be on the 
highway and not the town so I guess it will be my trip car.  Now which 
engine would be better for this instence.  The beettlemex engine or a type4 
engine???  What are the specs on the engines.  I have some specs on the 
beetlemex engine but not the type4 engine.  If anybody has any please send 
them on over.  See ya.
