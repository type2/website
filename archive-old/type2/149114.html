Subject: Re: [T2] Re: New welding question

Thanks for this Jay.

&gt;  Just drill through the top panel and fill in the whole with your 
&gt; weld.  Make sure it penetrates good to the bottom piece of metal.  
&gt; That's how I do panels.

Yes, I've done this and it works, but it's a lot of work compared to 
using a spot welder. So given that, I wonder why so few people spot 
weld (Todd's post has some suggestions, but I'm still a little 
perplexed).
