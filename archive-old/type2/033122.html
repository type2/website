Subject: turn signal problem

My turn signals on my 73 camper don't work.  The only thing is that my 
emergency flashers do work.  I don't know why one would work and not the 
other.  This problem has been going on for a long time. It used to be if my 
turn signals wouldn't work that I could turn my emergency flashers on and 
then off and my turn signals would work again, but now it even quit that.  
Any suggestions?  Also my bus won't start (again) and it doesn't even make a 
clicking or a clunking or a thud when I turn the key.  If I listen very 
carefully it makes a very quite sort of buzzing noise, but thats all.  It 
can't be the battery because the radio works, and the lights all come on.  Is 
it my starter?
