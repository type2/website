Subject: won't start still - help!

 
--Chuck,

I concur with everything you're saying, and add:

&gt;1. My comments on wire colors are from a color schematic for 77 and &gt;78 models. My 79 model schematic does not show wire colors.

they are typed in the wire. (at least in my bentley ie: bk/wh)

&gt;2. My 79 schematic does not show a &quot;hot start relay&quot; and does not &gt;appear to differ electrically from the 77/78 models in the area of &gt;the double relay.

ageed, what is this box at my solenoid/starter?

&gt;3. I assume you are reading 8 volts at the coil in position #2.

Yes

&gt;4. 6 volts (in position 3)is not enough to drive the pump properly &gt;hence the low pressure.

agreed.

&gt;5. 6 volts (in position 3) is most likely not enough to drive the &gt;ECU and electronic ignition as well hence no start even with pump &gt;working.

Yes, I realized this powered the ecu the other day as well. bad.

&gt;6.  I doubt that the pump, double relay, and ignition are bad. The &gt;problem is low voltage in pos #2 (8 volts) and lower voltage in pos &gt;#3(6 volts). Sounds like battery.

Agreed, except: Battery meters at 12.4, T30 at solenoid is 12.4, but by the time it comes back from the ignition switch, it's down to 8.

&gt;7.  You have non-stock wiring at and around the starter solenoid. &gt;Some one may have installed a &quot;hot start relay&quot; and it has &gt;failed.  I would restore to stock at this point. If the &gt;starter &quot;needs&quot; the hot start function there are better solutions 

I agree. Must verify what this is.

&gt;8.   Double relay 86a should be zero volts in ignition pos #1 and &gt;pos #2. It should go high in pos #3. This needs to be sorted out.

agreed.

&gt;Hang in there.

To everyone: Working on it. Will dive in this weekend and report later. Thanks for your time/thoughts.

Billy
