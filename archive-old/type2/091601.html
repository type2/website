Subject: Re: [T2] Head temperature sensor headache

[...] [...]
The temp sensor on your head should cost between 20-30
dollars. the FLAPS that is trying to sell you a sensor
does not know what he is talking about the head sensor
controls the fuel richness of the F.I. nothing to do
with a fan. Is this a bus or a 914 car, not that it
makes any differrnce. the Cyl head temp sensor should
ohm out cold 250-300--- Hot 2500-3000 ohm's. tighten
your's up and check it, being loose will cause all
kinds of problems. Phil
