Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

&gt; They are not profiled at the top corners like the good ones but they are
&gt; molded around the hinge, and at the bottom corners.



This still blows me away. They take the trouble to make the BOTTOM corners
square, but not the top ones?



I glued the 2 top corners square to the edge rather than curving around.
&gt; Probably I could have cut and glued the corners which I have done before
&gt; but decided not too.


They won't stay. Ask me how I know. ;-)

Cheap seals work fine, they just suck when compared to what's SUPPOSED to be
there. Without those corners you can get wind noise. The doors are hard to
shut for the first few months they're installed because the cheap ones stick
out more. But the cheap ones will stop the rain from getting in and keep the
drafts out. And those are the most important anyway.

I probably would cut the corners off like you mentioned. When I did the
seals on the GWB the originals were gone, replaced with cheap household
weatherstripping. Sigh.
