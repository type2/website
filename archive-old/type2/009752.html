Hi folks,

The bus is grinding and wondering, and the old coupling disk is on its last
legs.  So having grounded the thing until it is replaced, I have ordered a new
one from WWW.VWPARTS.COM.
(I got a ball joint from them a couple of months ago, they are fast but a little
more expensive than the Bus Depot).

Question:  I have search the manuals and the web page looking for warnings or
lists of dos and donts on replacing the coupling disks, but came up with
nothing.

Any advice from anyone?

Thanks
