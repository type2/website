hey y'all

anyone ever put 79 bus seats into a 76 or around there bus?=20

I am doing this now, and the mounting mechanisms are vastly different =
forcing me to cobble the two seat sets together. The mounting plate from =
my old driver side seat has holes that line up with the new seat, but =
not the original threaded ones.

I'm thinking of bolting them together as a solution. Also It seems I =
will have to cut a hole in the bottom of the new seats to accomodate the =
action of the handle, the old seats having had an indentation in place =
for this.

thoughts?
