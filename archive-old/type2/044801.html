&gt; Why would you disconnect the retard hose?

Hi,

Disconnect the retard hose and reset the idle to 7.5 degrees advance.  Adjust the carb
idle to 850 RPM and drive as the pre smog engines were designed to run.  I do not wish
to offend, but I find the air cooleds run cooler and longer without the smog controls
connected.  I also have had very good luck blocking off the central idle system and
balancing and adjusting both carbs as was the program on any multi carb engine.  This
is actually part of the initial carb set up proceedures before you get to the central
idle adjustment.

Keep Smiling,

Mike
