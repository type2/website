&gt; why would you want to plug the oil galleys.?
&gt; The standard plugs don't seem to leak or present problems.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone here put threaded plugs into the oil galleys on a T4
&gt; &gt; motor.
&gt; &gt; If so, what size plugs and how many?  I've got to pull the motor to
&gt; &gt; change some seals and would like to have the parts on hand first.
