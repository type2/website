Ok, I'm just going to cut to the meat of the problem here.  I drive a 73 Transporter, 1700cc engine, Factory Installed AC.  I have three problems, all of which I think are related, 1.  After I drive the bus for more than 20 minutes, it won't start again, and I either have to jump it, or charge the battery.  2.  The generator and brake warning lights come on about half brightness, unless the thermostat lever is all the way to hot and then they come on all the way, but they are both always on at a variable level of brightness.  3.  The cable that connects the Heater/Defroster lever on the dash to the lever that actually makes the change has broken, and they don't make them any more.  Here's some background, in attempts to solve the first two problems, I have replaced the following items with brand new, highest available quality parts, Battery, Starter, Solenoid, Voltage regulator, Heater Blower Relay (J14 on the Bentley schematic for a 72 and later Bus), Generator, and I've installed the Bosch &quot;Hard Start Relay Kit&quot; to solve what I thought was the rather common &quot;Hot starter problem&quot; of increased resistance in the ignition circuitry. I'm very frustrated as all my originally stated problems still exist, any suggestions?  Any help at all is appreciated, I have a voltmeter, if anyone needs electrical readings let me know I'll get them for you if you think they'll help.  Thanks in advance!
