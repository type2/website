&gt; Ok, so I've finally gotten frustrated with not having the right tools to

having the &quot;right&quot; tools are essential to safe working on something as
potentially hazardous as auto mechanics of any type

&gt; questions for the list (and will probably start a religious war in the

tool questions are probably only second to oil (or first to many)in
fervernt belief

&gt; process).  This is mostly regarding sockets, screwdrivers, wrenches and
&gt; simple automotive test equipment.

there are essential tools and then you suppliment them as you go.

&gt; 1. What brand of tools have you found to be reasonably (everthing is
&gt; relative here) priced but built well enough that you won't have to worry
&gt; about snapping your wrench in half getting those exhaust bolts out?

most people swear by SK or Snap On.  and I have to agree.  HOWEVER story
here.  about 40 years ago my father gave me a complete set of SK sockets
and wrenches to work on my first VW, and they were great, but about 30
years ago my garage was broken into and among other things they took my
toolbox
  Being broke and in the middle of a major repair I needed tools &quot;now&quot; I
had some credit left on my Wards credit card and used it to buy a set of
Ward's Powr Kraft sockets and metric combination wrenches, with the
thought that when I had some more money I would get SK tools.
  Today 30 years later everyone of those Powr Kraft tools are still giving
me yoeman service.  even things like the 1/2 inch breaker bar is still
going strong.  I have &quot;mislaid&quot; a few of the individual tools in the set
and have supplemented the tools with SK over the years, but when I reach
for a 13mm socket, I still come up with the Powr Kraft one I bought 30
years ago  (YMMV)


Now on to a pet peeve of mine, the most overlooked important tool in the
toolbox.  The screwdrivers,  For my money there is Stanley and there is
everything else.  A screw driver takes a beating and it MUST remain flat
and true at the tip or you might as well throw it away.  Stanleys hang in
there when every other tip is bent or rounded.  My personal preference are
the &quot;full fisted&quot; ones.  these have a large handle that is 3 sided and
square shafts.   A screw driver handle should be large enough that when
you put your hand around it your finger tips do not touch the palm or
thumb on the other side.  Most screw driver handles are too small.  Also
with the square shaft you can &quot;assist&quot; the turning action with a wrench if
need be.

don't skimp on screw drivers get at least the major 3 flat and 2 cross
head sizes a long handled one in at least the largest flat size, and a
very small long handled one.  

&gt; 2. What's the big deal between 6 point sockets/wrenches and 12 point
&gt; sockets/wrenches?  Why would I want to have one over the other, or both?

I have both and no rear preference, 

&gt; 3. How often (if ever) am I going to need deep sockets or universal sockets

get at least a 13mm deep socket, you will need it in one or two places on
the VW bus.    also get one or two extensions, 4 and 8 inch are good
sizes.
I can't remember the last time I used my universal 

Also get a set of metric allen wrenches, I like the Ball foot kind, more
expensive but you don't have to be straight on to use em.

&gt; or crowfoot wreches or anything beyond the basic socket/extension/handle

add in a needle nose pliers.
a long nosed and conventional &quot;Vise Grip&quot;  (ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES here)
  I have found no brand other than Vise Grip that won't give grief
a 4 inch and 8 inch adjustable wrench and a set of combination wrenches.
A multi meter (VOM) should be in your toolkit too.
I also have a few Hemostats and the &quot;magnetic grabber&quot;

and over the years I have bought a tool as I needed it for a job, now have
probably every tool known to man (ask my wife)

&quot;take care of your tools and they will take care of you&quot;!

Bob
