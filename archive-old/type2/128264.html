Subject: [T2] 74 Westy Stool and veggie bus update

&gt;I am not sure what Westfalia really intended,
but I imagine the salesguys probably said
something to the effect that it could be used as
a toilet in a pinch.

Hey Hotdog!  Long time, no post.  Hope things are
going better.  

Reminds me of the salesmen telling all the Mall
Utility Vehicle buyers that their spare tire well
was also a cooler.  :) 

Happy bussin'
Ray
