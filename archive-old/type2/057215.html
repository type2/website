Subject: either/or on rockers

about to do a bunch of rust work via a shop which,
inter alia, includes rocker replacement

options:
(1) buy replacement rockers
(2) let shop fab them from (they say) 22 gauge

opinions?  (quality measures, etc. -- i can compare dollars...)

tradeoff considerations on pulling off all the rubber
when repainting versus not fixing what ain't broke
also welcome.

thanks.  body work not my speciality.
