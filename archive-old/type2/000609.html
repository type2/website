Pat-

In my experience, rough idle problems are almost never caused by ignition
faults. Why? Even if the points/condenser are bad, the engine tends to idle
ok since it's not under load. If the engine runs ok at medium to full
throttle with no missing, I can almost guarantee it's NOT the ignition or
fuel delivery (fuel pump, etc.).
I would strongly suggest you look for a vacuum leak. Check all the vacuum
lines you have with a spray bottle of soapy water. Bubbles indicate a leak.
Also check around the throttle body and butterfly, especially the bottom
flange. If this doesn't work, try replacing all of the vacuum lines one at a
time. When you replace the offending hose(s), try doing it with the engine
idling, if it idles at all, this way you'll know instantly what caused the
problem.

Good Luck!

Tom
