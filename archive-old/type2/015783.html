Subject: Re: Roll your bus
Mime-Version: 1.0

Jan,

I have seen theese cages advertised in some car magazines. I think it was
tested in one of them but can't remember wich one. The only disadvatage
with it is that you  can't use it on a car body where the suspension is
taken off. Othervise it is a good solution if you need to do something
under the car. Just remember to drain all the fluids and take the battery
out:-)

But, there is always something better.... A friend of mine was restoring a
Volvo Amazon with the help of a home made cradle. It was bolted where the
bumpers used to be and constructed with the center of gravity in mind. You
could rotate the car a full turn around with ease, at least when the engine
and transmission was out. It could be locked in any position and the car
could be totally stripped without the cradle construction getting in the
way. This is the thing for the total restoration.

To make one of these for the VW bus can't be too hard, it just have to be
high enough. The &quot;rotating joints&quot; should be somewhere below the fresh air
intake grill in the front on a bus with the engine and tranny out? Or do
any listee have knowledge about the busses center of gravity? The total
height of the construction should be about 1,2 meter to allow full rotation.

&gt;According to the sales brochures they can be used for cars and vans up to
&gt;3500 Kg (7000 pounds!). The cage bolts on to the wheel hubs, so when the car
&gt;is on it's side the whole weight must be carried by two wheels. My question
&gt;is: Has any of you ever used a similar setup and what do you think about it?
&gt;I have my reservations about putting all that weight on the wheels at this
&gt;angle.
