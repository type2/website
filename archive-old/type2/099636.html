Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect /RANT/ (and a little long)

&gt;If you put my bus next to another one with the same paint-job, same 
&gt;interior, etc. and price the other one $1,000 less, I'll bet 9 out of 10 
&gt;people would buy the cheaper one. Never mind that the cheaper one has a 
&gt;loosey-goose front end, cooked brakes, 150,000-mile tranny, no door seals, 
&gt;whatever. VW owners are, by and large, a cheap lot and if it runs and they 
&gt;can keep it in the right-hand lane at highway speed and stop it within a 
&gt;reasonable distance, it's all they need. Or so they think. Then they burn 
&gt;through a set of tires in 8,000 miles and wonder why the steering wheel 
&gt;keeps sliding back and forth 3 inches without moving the wheels. They take 
&gt;it to a shop and find out the &quot;bargain&quot; bus will now cost another $1100 to 
&gt;get the steering box, tie rods and ball joints straightened out (ALL '71s 
&gt;need new ball joints, *unless* someone had the foresight to fix them 
&gt;before they sold it).

Comes with our vehicles' place on the food chain. Corvairs and Fiats are 
exactly the same.

I've seen folks that buy a basket case that they thought was just great and 
then park them 3 months later in the back yard because they realized they 
can't afford the repairs ($1000+) that they were not diligent enough to 
notice before they bought the vehicle. The van sits there rusting away 
until they get tired of looking at it and just dump it - unfortunately it's 
a rust bucket not worth fixing. I got a couple this way for parts.

Funny how alot of folks buy vehicles to restore and then realize that they 
don't have the time, tools, budget or motivation to do the dirty and hot 
(or cold) work involved.
