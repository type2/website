&lt;&lt; I have been in the process of building my first VW engine, a 1600 DP for 
my 71 bus.  The plan was to get it all ready, and install it this past 
weekend.  Everything went together pretty well, and I got to the point where 
the engine was done, and all that was left was putting on the tin pieces.  I 
put on the pulley tin, cylinder shrouds, and type 3 cool tins, problem-free. 
&gt;&gt;

Why are you putting type 3 tin on a type 1 engine?  Does it cool better?
