Hi Steve,

Hydrogen can easily be created with electrolysis, using electrical current to
split H2O molecules. This enables hydrogen to be produced by wind, solar,
hydro-electric or (horrorific gasp) nuclear power plants.

The advantage of hydrogen as an energy medium is that it's a much more 
efficient
means of storage than an electrical grid. You can generate hydrogen 
using solar
or wind power and stockpile it for use at night or when the weather is still.

I'm sure we *could* implement a hydrogen distribution network if we wanted to.
But as long as Big Business is so integrated with dinosaur juice byproducts
there will be very little development in this area.

Happy Trails,

Greg

&gt; Greg ( and all)
&gt;
&gt; The problem with hydrogen (fuel cells and a like) was
&gt; included in the last line of your article:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Significant obstacles still exist for fuel cell
&gt; vehicles, especially the costs of the fuel cell stacks
&gt; and of producing and delivering hydrogen.&quot;&quot;&quot;
