&gt;&gt; Wasn't  there some procedure involving Bon Ami polishing compound for

&gt;&gt; Or, would it be better to just make a big oil seperator and  leave

&gt; hey george   The bon ami or clorox  is a last gasp  thing.   valve seals
&gt; might help. seperator would do wonders, what do  they cost?  later mark D

Yes, I wouldn't use the bon ami thing unless you _really_ know what you
are doing!  My thought is that the ring design was intended for a
combustion engine, not a compressor, so it is possible that the rings will
never keep the oil out.  It might be possible to machine the pistons and
incorporate teflon seals or somesuch on the compressor side, but now we're
really in engineerland!

A separator could be bodged from scrap pretty easily.  A piece of water
pipe (as large a diameter as possible) with inlet and outlet fittings on
each end and a drain fitting on the bottom.  Stuff the pipe with some form
of coarse metal mesh (like the metal scrubbers used by dishwashers).  As
the vapor-laden air passed through the labyrinth it would have
to wend its way through the mesh.  The vapor would stick to the mesh and
drip to the bottom of the pipe.  Periodically the pipe would have to be
drained.

This is just a preliminary idea.  It could probably be improved.
