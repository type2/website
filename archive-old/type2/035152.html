Subject: Re: power loss, idle trouble etc. sort of an update]

Hey, Rik--

Good to hear from you.  I put a filter [with clamps] 
before the pump this morning and let it idle for 
awhile, but didn't really find anything.  I suppose 
that's not surprising.

I checked my idle cutoff switch, and it looks like it 
isn't working and will have to be replaced.  That can't 
be helping, but I don't think it's my main problem--I 
think the fuel delivery system is plugged somewhere 
along the line.

The fuel pump seems to be working, though it turns out 
that it's one of those Bocars that can't be opened to 
inspect/clean the filter [I was thinking it had the 
screw on the top].  Someone's idea of progress.

But I'm still stuck on low idle.  Starts great, idles 
great.  Occasionally accelerates, but not reliably and 
not for very long.  That's it.

So, if it really is crud in my fuel tank, how can I 
figure that out without pulling the engine and removing 
the tank just to see?  [Also can't help noticing a 
distinct absence of 1970 bus fuel tanks in any of the 
catalogues I have.]

best,

Quoting Rik &lt;nisse_at_cnw_dot_com&gt;:

&gt;  &gt;Bob suggested changing the filter. I did that, but
&gt;  &gt;forgot to mention it. Sorry. My filter's between the
&gt;  &gt;fuel pump and the carb; I don't have one between the
&gt;  &gt;fuel tank and the fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; Don't forget there is a filter (woven sleeve) in the 
fuel tank
&gt; as a part of the fuel tap.  Older style fuel pumps 
also
&gt; have a built-in fuel filter--it is behind a hex head 
about a
&gt; half inch in diameter.
&gt;
&gt; You should have a disposable filter just BEFORE the 
pump--
&gt; to keep junk from getting that far.  If you are 
afraid of the
&gt; pump disintegrating, you may also want to have one
&gt; between the pump and the carb(s).--but this should not
&gt; be your main filter.
&gt;
&gt; As always, use the correct diameter of fuel line for 
a good fit,
&gt; and USE HOSE CLAMPS ON EVERY CONNECTION, please.
&gt;
&gt; happy filtering!
