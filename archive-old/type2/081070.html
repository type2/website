Subject: RE: [T2] Parts List to fix Troy's broken bus.....

David,
	I hope this is true as I can not really afford a new one.  Guess
we'll see how it goes.  I am currently looking up all vw shops or
possible shops that could help that are in the Greensboro area. Incase I
need to but other parts.  Hope I won't have to though.  Thanks.

Troy

&gt;I hate to add, but does anyone have opinions on if troy should also
&gt;get a throwout bearing?

YES I have an opinion on this!  If his old throwout bearing works well, 
leave it in there unless he can find a brand new factory-original
throwout 
bearing.  I have had bad experiences (yes, plural) with new replacement 
throwout bearings of questionable origin and IMO you are just as likely
if 
not more likely to have to pull the engine again if you replace your
good, 
working throwout bearing with an unknown-quantity new one.  If the
bearings 
roll smoothly and it doesn't make noise, leave it there!

My 2 cents.

-David
