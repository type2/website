Subject: oil pressure when cold

'78 type 4 FI engine (california model).
Approx 140K miles on engine, unrebuilt.

When the engine is cold (eg first started,
its not really cold, maybe 15C), the oil
pressure is quite high, ~55psi on the gauge.
The head temp cranks to its normal operating
temp quite quickly, but the manifold temp
takes a long time to come up (and drops fast
when the load is off the engine).
The oil pressure stays high until after about
15 minutes of road-driving operation, then
it rapidly (instantly) drops to normal, ~29psi.
Its running 10W40.

Now the catch is, it didn't really do this
last year. Or if it did, I didn't notice it for
some reason.

Suggestions? There's some sort of oil diverter
valve for when cold. Can that be checked? How?
Am I worried about nothing?
