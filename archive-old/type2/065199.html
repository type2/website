    for some reason they dont like longhaired folks in old vw buses.

as a long-haired male, i can report that they searched
my bus from top to bottom when i came off the yarmouth
ferry in nova scotia with my two kids (very young) howling
alongside saying things like &quot;Daddy, they broke my doll!&quot;
and stuff like that.  just us, a pickup truck full of 
barrels of bait, and a station wagon got searched out of
hundreds of vehicles.  took two hours.  and you can be
sure that the real smugglers are using boats...
