Subject: Re: wheels/tires again

Whooooo!

Nemo, you sound like you are in the same mood I was in yesterday!!&lt;grin&gt;.

No, I don't want it to ride or corner like sh*t.

The whole point was to corner and ride better without the vast expanse of=
=20
rubber between the rim and the road.

If load range &quot;d&quot; means stiff sidewalls then how about 50 series
tires with a good load rating.  The idea was hug the ground with some=20
serious rubber on the ground.

In case nobody noticed, some of the tires previously mentioned as good are=
=20
marginal on a 5.5&quot; rim and specs say they should be on a 6&quot; and up.

Just trying to do a little better and get a little more rubber on the=20
ground.....and no....I'm really not into thumper speakers, but I am sure=20
considering a reverb as a period accessory&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Any comments?
&gt;=20
&gt; Yes, it will look like sh*t and ride like sh*t.=20
&gt; And people will laugh at you.  I assume you will
&gt; add thumper speakers and those kewl glowing blue
&gt; or red lights on the front?  Lower it?  Clear
&gt; rear lenses?  Aren't there any useless civics or
&gt; neons around you that you could do this to?  Must
&gt; you waste a bus? =20
