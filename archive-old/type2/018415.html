         It would be much better all the way around to put the 78 2.0L
in the Vanagon. No tranny problems (besides the shaft you mentioned,
remember that the 1800 was used with a 4.86 ratio final drive, not the
4.57 of your Vanagon) and also that the Vanagon is significantly heavier
than the bus that 1800 was in.
