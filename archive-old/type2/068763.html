Subject: Re: Splitty Crew Cab Seat Qs

Its been awhile since I owned a splitty double cab (a 66 back in 72-76) but 
as I recall the rear seat is similar to the early single/double cab front 
seats...the ones with the single piece top and the single piece bottom. 
However, as I recall, the bottom part of the seat is much taller than the 
bottom of the front seat.

If you are going to put in the front seat from a 1/3 2/3 '64 van, I believe 
that you will have to weld in the adjustment rails for the driver's seat, 
and the clips that hold the passenger seats in place.
