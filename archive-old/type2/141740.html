Hi Wayne-

I appreciate the offer, however a mistake was made- 
The hubcap and I are located in Manhattan Kansas.

If you'd pass the info onto the type2 list too, I'ad
apppreciate it.

Thanks,

David

&gt;...Are there any list members in the NYC area who
&gt; could rendezvous with  
&gt; 
&gt; David and get the hubcap back into circulation?
&gt; Ideally it would be nice to see the hubcap head out to the west coast
&gt; for a change.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can help, please email vwwestyman_at_yahoo_dot_com,
&gt; NOT me.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,
