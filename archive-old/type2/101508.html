Subject: Re: [T2] BBB AZ Propane Q 

&gt; AZ Folks -
&gt; 
&gt; I have some 5-gallon propane tanks, one of which I was going to bring to BBB 
&gt; for heat. These are &quot;older&quot; propane tanks without the new, California 
&gt; (only?) &quot;overfill prevention valves&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Does AZ have the same law that a propane tank must have the OPV for a 
&gt; propane dealer to fill the tank?

It's not a Cali law -- it's nationwide. There may still be some places
where you can trade them in on the newer style. I did that with mine, I
think I paid $16/5 gallon tank (unfilled).
