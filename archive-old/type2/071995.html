Jerry,

Your parking brake is sticking, it happens to me about once a year.  You
need to get some high temp antisieze paste (there may be a special kind for
brake work but I just use the regular copper-based stuff), take off the
rear drums and clean and lube the moving parts inside the there (but
sparingly).  Don't get any lube on the shoes or the drum. You may need to
lube the P-Brake cables as well.  Release them from the parking brake
handle at the front and then you can pull them out of the backing plate a
bit to lube them.

&gt;&gt; Well I logged in to post about a clunking sound coming from my '78 bus.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Started yesterday when I was pulling out of my garage. The bus felt like it
&gt;&gt; was glued down with one deep CLUNK. I thought it was water on the floor of
&gt;&gt; the garage frozen to the tire. No outstanding sounds all was happy in the
&gt;&gt; bus during the ride to work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But then similar clunk when I left my parking space at the end of the day.
&gt;&gt; I was distracted and did not make much of it then. Bit of a clunking sound
&gt;&gt; during the drive home; faint and only lasted for a few blocks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This mornings CLUNK could not bet ignored. Same feeling of a tire stuck to
&gt;&gt; the floor. Denise was driving and thinks it was the front right wheel. But
&gt;&gt; then it started to clunk, keeping time with our speed. Went around the
&gt;&gt; block and parked it in front of our house.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I will be opening it up tonight when I get home.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I will start looking for a loose brake caliper.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anything else I should be looking for?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also need to mention that I use my parking brake.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Jerry
