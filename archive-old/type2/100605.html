Subject: RE: [T2] coleman heater in a bus

I bought a Coleman Black Cat heater last year and have used it extensivly
when camping in my bus, 1960 DD and love it. It is the top of the line model
with the battery operated fan. I turn it on a half hour before sleepy time
and when I go to bed it is toasty warm. A bottle of propane will last all
night. The only downfall is it really drys the air out, but a partially
opened window takes care of that. Well worth the 80 dollars it cost.

I have been thinking of getting one of those new coleman heaters that is at 
walmart. it says there is no problem using it indoors, but it is propane 
powered - any concerns using this for sleeping/driving????

thanks
