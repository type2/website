Subject: Re: [T2] Defroster Dilemma



&gt; Does anybody on the list know of a service to repaint the defroster lines on
&gt; rear windows?
&gt; I know that touch-up kits for rear window defrosters are available (although
&gt; I don't know where).  And, if I have to go that route, I guess I'll give it a
&gt; try although the lines in my rear window are pretty ragged.  And I have seen
&gt; the plastic press-on grids in the past - those are definitely not for me.
&gt; But I sure would like a lead on somebody who restores those painted-on
&gt; defroster grids (if such an animal even exists).

All the kits I have seen and tried were a joke......
I find it a lot easier to replace the window with a good used one.
You didn't say what year your bus is. There is a difference in the position of
the connecters between early and late. 73? and back, the connecters are in the
middle. 74? and up, the connecters are at the top side.
