To: Type 2 Mailing List &lt;type2_at_BIGKITTY.AZACCESS.COM&gt;,

aha! so you don't understand the Weakly Statz!??? :) ok, here's a shorty
intro to the Numbing Numbers ...

WHERE ...
-AUS         1, -ZA          1, HI         3, NC.RA-DU   6, RI         4

- in front means non-US. well, i live in the US so our states don't have the
designator in front. :) -AUS is Australia. it means one person is located
in Aus, but i don't have any more specific info. same with -ZA (South Africa)
HI is the US state of Hawaii. NC.RA-DU is North Carolina, but specifically
the Raleigh-Durham area. RI is Rhode Island (well ... i guess i COULD be
a little more specific than that). :)

-AUS.ACT     1, AK.ANC       2, IA         1, NC.W       1, SC         1

aha! here we have one person in Australia, but he told me he was in their
Capitol Territory (ACT). and AK.ANC is Alaska, Anchorage area. IA is Iowa
and NC.W is just western North Carolina. and so forth.

-AUS.NSW     3, AK.FB        1, IA.CR      1, NC.WIL     1, SC.E       1

New South Wales, Australia. then Fairbanks, Alaska. Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Wilmington, NC, and Eastern South Carolina. like that.

-AUST        1, AL.AUB       1, ID         1, NH         2, TN.E       1

no, that's Austra.


-CAN         7, AL.BIRM      1, IL         2, NH.MAN     1, TN.KNOX    2

7 in Canada, but that's all i know about them. no city or province.

-CAN.AB.CAL  2, AL.HUNT      1, IL.BLM     1, NJ         2, TN.MEM     2

Canada, Alberta, Calgary. Alabama, Huntsville. etc.

now, in california, it's a bit weird. CA.BA is the Bay Area, around San
Francisco. too many little/big cities to split them out. so far.

-UK.SCO      1, GA.SAV       1, NC.FAY     1, PA.PITT    2
-UK.WAL      1, GA.W         1, NC.GB-WS   2, PA.YORK    3

United Kingdom, Scotland (and Wales). etc.

       Unknown     250      Total       709

and these are the number of folks for whom i have NO location data, and
can't tell from your email addresses. :)

now the WHAT ...
50 Microbus   0, 59 Microbus   1, 68 Bus   5, 80 Vanagon  16, 91 Eurovan   0

seeminly oblivious, it's NO 1950 Microbuses, 1 1959 Splitty, 5 1968 buses,
16 1980 Vanagons, and NO 1991 Eurovans (sold that year in Europe).

and so forth. then the total breaks it down in to models of the four
&quot;generations&quot; of buses:

 Microbus   36 - Camper  10, Panel    2, Pickup   6, Kombi    2, Deluxe   6
 Bus        89 - Camper  56, Panel    0, Pickup   3, Kombi    0
 Vanagon   588 - Camper 282, Kombi    1, Pickup  14, Diesel  31, Syncro 114
 Eurovan    24 - Camper   9, Panel    0, Pickup   0, Diesel   1, Syncro   0
 Total     737

and then it jus puts out the generation total slightly differently ...

Whatever Mailing List   709 people,   737 vehicles
    36 Microbus,    89 Bus,   588 Vanagon,    24 Eurovan

and reminds all you Sniveling Lurkers that you're still out there. :)

     6 Wanabus,    172 Unknown Sniveling Lurkers :)

then some blatant commercial messages .... :)

and that's it. no, there's not really any rhyme or reason why i split out
this or that city, except that when it gets to be a lot of folks AND i
notice it, i try to split it out. Merced, Ca will likely be the next one. :)

have a happy Friday, folks. :)
