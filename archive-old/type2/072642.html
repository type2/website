Subject: Whoops. Overtorqued the heads

I paid the penalty for paying more attention to the late '50s music on the
stereo than to the head nuts that I was torqueing on my  1776 today. I have
a calibrated torque wrench and must consult a chart to translate torque on
the wrench to torque on the nut.

The target value for the head nuts was 23 ftlbs.  While humming along to
Get a Job, I forgot about the calibration and actually torqued them to 25
ftlbs.

Is it better to leave them at 25 or to loosten them and begin the torquing
sequence again?
