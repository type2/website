Subject: part# identification help

just about to cruise out on a dogwalk this evening and found a broken black
plastic pile of part shards under the streetlight out front. the pieces
were real small. i couldn't make heads or tails of it them, except i found
the tiny vw insignia, and gathered three pieces with a nine digit part
number: 211.415.671 black, plastic 1-2&quot;, round. hopefully it'll be cheap
and replaceable :)       if it was mine, which i suspect it'd be off the 68
