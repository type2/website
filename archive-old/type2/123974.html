Subject: Need outdoor cover for camper

This is the standard factory Campmobile (1971).  I need a reasonably priced
(around $100.00, more or less) outdoor cover.  I'm not picky about perfect
custom fit and feel sure any transporter cover would work, maybe even a
Vanagon cover.

I would greatly appreciate any sources, ideas, etc.

Thanks,
Doug
