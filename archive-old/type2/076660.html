Fans claim MasterCard stole their idea for commercials

MINNEAPOLIS -- Two Minnesota Twins fans who made a documentary film about
traveling in a Volkswagen van to ballparks across the nation have sued
MasterCard, claiming the company stole their idea for its commercials.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Minneapolis, David Hoch and Joe
Marble accuse MasterCard and its ad agency of duplicating their 1998
documentary in a series of commercials.

According to the lawsuit, MasterCard used a Volkswagen van with the same
orange-and-white coloring as the one Hoch and Marble drove, used video shots
of stadiums photographed through bridge girders that resemble scenes in
their film, and had music similar to theirs.

&quot;You start asking yourself, 'How could this be a coincidence?' &quot; said
Minneapolis lawyer Ronald Schutz, who filed the lawsuit.

The lawsuit accuses MasterCard and New York-based McCann-Erickson Worldwide
of violating the copyright. It seeks unspecified damages and an injunction
barring further use of the commercials.

&quot;If there is a substantial amount of similarity between the film and the
commercial, and MasterCard or the ad agency knew of the film, this case
could hold up,&quot; Mark Conrad, professor of legal and ethical studies at the
Fordham University School of Business, told ESPN_dot_com. &quot;The other essential
question to ask is: Can what these guys did in the documentary be deemed
original?&quot;

A spokeswoman for the ad agency said Monday she hadn't seen the lawsuit and
couldn't comment. Representatives of MasterCard couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.

Hoch, 41, a mortgage broker from Arden Hills, and Marble, 41, a real estate
broker from Hopkins, created the group Citizens United for Baseball in
Minnesota after hearing rumors in 1997 about a plan to move the Twins. The
following year, the two filmed their travels to ballparks in Milwaukee,
Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore and Denver.

The documentary, called &quot;Twins -- Now and Forever,&quot; was shown at the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., according to the lawsuit.
