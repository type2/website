Subject: RE: should I keep the Jetta

Tom,
  I rely exclusively on my '72 bus and find it adequate.  The only thing I
have to do is keep my head inside that engine compartment and know the
state of all things mechanical well in advance.  I have run into some
starter problems that caught me unawares, and some brake oddities I
inflicted on myself by buying cheap brake pads.  But I regularly check the
CV boots, brakes, engine stuff, and I have a good mechanic within biking
distance.
   A few years ago I figured that the cost of keeping and running a car is
about $2000 a year (not figuring the actual cost of the vehicle).  It
doesn't matter much if the car is new or old.  New ones cost more for
insurance and licensing; old ones cost more for repairs.  So I guess if
it's worth two grand for that extra vehicular life boat then you keep the
Jetta.
  Watch, you're going to sell the Jetta and the van will do something horrid.
No, that could never happen.
