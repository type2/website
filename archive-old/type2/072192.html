&gt;Subject: Dear Sirs,

&gt;As Volkswagen bus collectors and owners, the members of AIRS are very
&gt;insulted by your actions and poor judgement.  We are sending out a letter to
&gt;all 900 of our members, national and international, to let them know of the
&gt;incident.  We are including the name of your campground, the location, and
&gt;the details as told to us.
&gt;
&gt;We are also filing an official complaint with AAA, Good Sam, and the
&gt;Virginia Attorney General's office.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, and have a good day.
&gt;
&gt;Charlie Ford
