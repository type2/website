Subject: Re: Warranty hassles

&gt;The bus I recently bought came with a &lt; 2000 mile engine in it, still 
&gt;under warranty with the local mechanic who rebuilt it. Whilst checking it 
&gt;out, I discovered that compression in #3 is only 90 lbs, the other 3 all 
&gt;&gt;= 120.
&gt;
&gt;So, I had the mechanic check it out, and his story is: &quot;If you used cheap 
&gt;gas (87 octane), then the piston could overheat, and this would not be 
&gt;covered by warranty. I'll pull the engine and fix it, but if it's not our 
&gt;fault, then you pay.&quot;

At 2000 miles you are overdue for re-torquing the heads on a rebuilt 
engine.  Everybody thinks I am nuts and that it is overkill, but 
whenever I rebuild an engine, I re-torque the heads at 500 miles, 
1000 miles, and 2000 miles.  I don't think I am nuts because on a 
few engines, they have needed re-torquing when I checked them.  My 
suggestion would be to check this before anything else.

His story about cheap gas does not necessarily hold water.  An air 
cooled engine can run fine on 87 octane with a combination of the 
correct compression ratio and timing for that octane.  Personally, 
I run 92 or 93 octane in my engines.

As far as I'm concerned, the only warranty that is worth a damn is 
the warranty you never have to use, which is quality work done the 
first time.  If you are serious about &quot;cashing in&quot; on your warranty, 
then disassemble the engine at his shop in his presence.  If it is 
something like a cracked ring or a bad valve guide, then it is more 
clearly his fault.  If it is a burned piston or valve, then the odds 
are on his side that is was over heated.

Either way, you have to decide for yourself if you trust the guy to 
fix it for you.  I like to give someone one chance to make something 
right, because everyone makes mistakes sometimes.  On the other hand, 
I try to do all my work myself because I know I care more about my 
buses than someone who fixes buses to earn a paycheck.

One man's warped veiw of the universe,

Dave
