Subject: RE: [T2] Optimal Exhaust For 78 - build your own

  &gt;Most aftermarket parts have to be tweaked a little,
&gt;some a lot.
&gt;John Stiles

Boy you've got that right, I just bought a new Danish muffler from cip1_dot_ca for my 1200 40HP (it was listed as German BTW), and we literally had to put a crowbar on one of the preheat tubes to line it up properly. NOT good. My thought on the exhaust fix, is this:
I'm going to buy the Bugpack header piece for 54 dollars Canadian, then go to my local Canadian Tire. There I will buy their generic 20 dollar Flowmaster muffler and the proper 90 degree turn and muffler tip. I'll have it built in such a way that the only thing clamped will be the muffler to the bends. When the muffler dies, it will be easy to replace it.
