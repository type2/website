--Karl,

what does it mean if there's no aspect ratio, what is the assumed/standard aspect of the tire in this case?

it is a ratio of how the tire &quot;stands up&quot; yes?

&gt;WRONG size!!!
&gt;The correct bus tire does NOT have 75 in the middle. 
&gt;It is 185R14.  NO ASPECT RATIO!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hey Ya'll,
&gt;&gt; I have been my due diligence on research, am ready to order.  Is there any
&gt;&gt; reason I should not order this tire???
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, $71 per installed from Discount tire.
