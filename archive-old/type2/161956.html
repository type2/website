This was sent to me by someone who isn't on the list (Mark, who I've  
CC'd).  Thoughts?

Cheers,

Hi

My apologies in advance if i'm directing this to the wrong person. My  
'77 Westy ran like a dream over the Sierra Nevada' range until she  
hit elevation i.e 7000 - 9000ft. All of a sardine she got very  
sluggish. We then descended to around 6000ft and she started the  
dreaded 'miss'. It would be most obvious when we were climbing a hill  
and over a period of 2 days it got progressively worse. As a result i  
could not get her home. My local VW contact suggested that i move the  
little wheel with the teeth on them in the air flow sensor, 2 notches  
anti-clockwise (I hope that this makes sense to you). This did not  
take care of the problem. Any tips on what to do to get her home and  
for driving at high elevation would be most welcomed.

Thank you in advance.
Mark Morison.
