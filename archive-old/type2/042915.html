Squeal is normal.  That's the oscillator you're hearing.  At least it was
normal on the last couple of CDs I had. (Tiger, Mallory)  Twenty years ago...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I just installed a new tiger 581 on my 78 FI westfalia. It works fine
&gt; but makes a high pitched squeal when the ignition is turned on. To
&gt; anyone who has one of these installed, is this normal? T
