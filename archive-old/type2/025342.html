Here's how I cured a lot of my starting problems in a VW I've got, and since
VW starting is VW starting, this should be applicable to all...

Volkswagens don't crank for one of four reasons: stuck starter, burned out
starter, dead battery and no (or not enough) power to the keyswitch terminal
on the solenoid. All four have happened to me.

Unsticking the starter is easy enough--put the car in gear, take the key out
and push with all your might. With a Bus, pushing with another car would be
an acceptable use of force.

Burnt-out starter? If you get under the vehicle and bridge the two 13mm nuts
on the solenoid and no cranking occurs, the starter's broken. I like to pull
the starter, take off the endcap and polish the armature where the brushes
ride; sometimes that helps. You might also want to visit an auto electric
shop and ask about rebuilds; this will get you nice fresh brushes.

Dead battery is obvious, or is it? Turn on the headlights. If they won't go
on, you've got either a dead battery or more problems than you want to think
about at this juncture.

Low voltage to the keyswitch is what I want to address. You can attack this
in many ways. I'd start by putting a relay in. I mount mine as far away from
the engine as I can get it; a good place is to find a bolt in the frame rail
and install a little hunk of angle aluminum with two holes drilled in it
under the nut. One hole will mount the aluminum, and the other will mount
the relay. My favorite automotive relays are Radio Shack foglight relays;
easy to get and durable. Mine's five years old and still clicking away.
There are four prongs on one of these--the two coil prongs and the two
switch prongs. The positive coil prong goes to the keyswitch wire; the
negative prong to a good ground. You hook one switch prong to the keyswitch
prong on the solenoid and the other to the fat-wire-from-the-battery bolt.
So called because there's a fat wire going from this bolt to the battery.

I use a new roll of wire for this, because I run the rest of the wire up to
the keyswitch. With a new wire and a relay shooting power directly from the
battery into your starter solenoid's activation prong, you should get good
cranking every time.

About heat shields: The racing community uses a special blanket on their
starters. Summit Racing (http://www.summitracing_dot_com I think) will have
them.
