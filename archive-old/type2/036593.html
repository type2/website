&gt; Two of these  -  a bus and a '79 vert  -  have been sitting throughout the
&gt; winter months while I rebuild engines.  In the past week,  I've finished a
&gt; rebuild and needed to start an engine on a test stand in the garage. Two of
&gt; the four batteries which worked just fine last autumn were dead and
&gt; wouldn't take a charge at the local gas station.  Both were less than three
&gt; years old. So it looks as though I'm in the market for batteries.

Batteries don't like sitting around, particularly when it is cold.  This
is the surest way to kill them.

If you do need to keep a battery out of service, put it in a plastic
battery box, store it in a reasonably warm place (say 50 degrees up) and
give it a trickle charge every month or two.

&gt; Before I head on down to Sears,  does anyone have good or bad experiences
&gt; with various brands to share?  Does any  brand beat the odds and give a
&gt; good unit every time?

Sears is the last place I'd go for a battery.  Overpriced, lousy warrenty
service, and high pressure sales all wrapped up in one.

There's no sure bets with batteries, but I've had good luck with Pep Boys,
who buy their batteries from Exide.  Prices are reasonable, warrenty
returns are no-questions-asked, and the batteries live for a reasonable
time (last bug battery went 5+ years).  Most of these batteries also have
removable cell caps, which allow you to check the electrolyte level and
replenish with distilled water when needed.  Batteries produce hydrogen
gas when in operation, which comes from the water.  &quot;Maintainance Free&quot;
batteries should be called &quot;maintainance impossible&quot; batteries!


When you get the battery for the bus, get a Group 24 battery, not the bug
battery.  It'll fit in the compartment and will give longer life than that
little bug battery.
