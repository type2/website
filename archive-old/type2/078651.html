Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires&amp;crush space.

This is whaT VW did to meet the German crash requirements in the late 70s see http://www.vanfest_dot_org/1998/p05.htm

Good luck

&gt; If the front tire mount were extended out from the
&gt; bumper and designed properly you could improve crash
&gt; safety by increasing crush space.  Only problem is how
&gt; does an individual design and model this extra crush
&gt; space?  Anyone MEs who've done any of this design
&gt; work?
&gt; 
&gt; Rob
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; But wouldn't the tire and wheel also serve to spread
&gt; &gt; the impact over a
&gt; &gt; greater area and therefore provide a greater amount
&gt; &gt; of structure to absorb
&gt; &gt; said impact? I thought that would be a good thing.
