Same thing happened with my newly rebuilt 1776 dp upright. I changed the
oil at 400 miles break-in, installed new pressure relief springs. I've
got about 1400 miles on it now, and it got better as it broke in. I'm
guessing all the new stuff makes the engine run hotter, which makes the
oil thinner, which makes the oil pressure go down. I've got my idle set
pretty low (I like to hear the cam lope), and the light hardly ever
comes on, now.

Probably not a bad idea to boost the idle a little during the break-in
period.
