Subject: 10mm hose clamps

Does anyone have a good source for the FI hose clamps that fit the 10mm hose
between the pump and filter? The largest I can find in the store is meant
for 3/8&quot; ID hose. The largest I can find online grow to 17.3mm (or 11/16&quot;)
which is just shy of what I need. I think I need a FI clamp for a 1/2&quot; ID
hose.

The original was a band that was pinched on.
