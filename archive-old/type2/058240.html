Subject: Starting  Anamoly

Strange thing happened today.
Drove my '78 w/2L FI for 65 mile trip averaged 70 mph.
Stopped at a store then started like a champ.  Went 4 miles in city
traffic and stopped at another store.  Returned to bus that wouldn't
start.  Had plenty of juice.  Checked battery connections - one slightly
loose (tightened) the other slightly corroded (cleaned)
Still no start.
Checked connections at starter.  All just recently cleaned and the like.

Still no start.
Broke down and started pushing in attempt to push start. (embarassing,
but I would rather push my bus than any other vehicle)  VROOOOM!!
Drove1 block to a gas station to refuel for ride home.  Turned off
engine to fuel.  Fueled up (21 mpg! )  Paid nice attendant person.
Jumped in bus, crossed fingers, turned key and it started like a champ.
Any Ideas!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
