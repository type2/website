Subject: Cover for 79 conversion

The cover for the same year Westy will probably do. I just bought this
about three weeks ago and I need to pull the engine and rebuild. I
promised my wife we would do the kitchen remodel we decided to do 3
months ago first. The bus will not fit in the garage :-(. Changing the
garage door so that it will fit would cost $500 so.... The paint is in
great condition and I want to keep it that way!! I have seen some covers
on various web pages -- any suggestions on what is best? - what will last?

If a child is not learning then we should change how we are teaching him/her.
