Subject: Gauges

Hi List,
After reading all of the comments on the list regarding gauges, I've decided
to take the big step and put some in my bus ('77 bus, 2L carb. Type 4
motor). I've had a beetle for years and never saw the need for them there,
but because the bus motor works much harder (and is MUCH more expensive to
re-build) it's a case of better safe than sorry.
I have purchased (at least they're on there way) oil temp., oil press.,
volts, tacho, vacuum, and fuel press. (the cyl. head temp. seemed a little
over board to me, and over priced).
My question is this, I don't want to clutter the dash up too much, so which
gauges do I really need up the front? I'm thinking of putting the two oil
gauges and the volts up the front, but leaving the rest (tacho, vacuum and
fuel press.) in the engine bay, as I see them being more useful for tune-ups
and fault finding.
Any recommendations, opinions or other suggestions greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
