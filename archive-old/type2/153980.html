Subject: RE: HOSED by a transport company!

Craig,

Check out my shipping tips at
http://www.marcusschaper_dot_de/en/cars/transport.htm. Darrell is based in
Houston and may be able to this very quickly. Also call Janet at Jade Auto
Services. I know that they are doing a run to the South West about now.

You can also rent a trailer or dolly from someone else - i.e. U-Haul.

Marcus

From: craig &lt;vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org&gt;
so now i am stuck with a bus that MUST leave phonix for west texas by 
monday, and to make things more exciting, the people i am renting the 
moving truck from (budget) have no more trailers or dollies for this 
weekend.
