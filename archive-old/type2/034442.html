Subject: Better fuel Injection kit

Hi,
For those of you who have not been following this debate we have been 
talking about trying to convert a stock Fuel Injection system to a full 
mechanical system also made by Bosch. The mechanical system was developed 
after the stock electrical Injection was developed and as a result the weak 
points of the system have been eliminated.
This conversion offers the following advantages.
Way better fuel lines and connections, greatly reducing the risk of fuel 
line leaks and the consequences thereof.

Since this system does not use electrically powered Injectors, computers or 
electically powered air flow meters there is much less of a chance of being 
left on the side of the road.

This is the same system used on hundreds of thousands of Volkswagen 
Rabbits,Volvo's Audi's and even turbo Porsche models.
Yes it is true you can wack off the stock system and put in a carb or two 
but I think most people will agree that this really isn't the best solution 
to the problem. [is anyone building a car with a carb. anymore?]
I have been corresponding with Gary Miller of Miller Fuel Injection and he 
has crunched some numbers and come up with the following prices for anyone 
who is interested.
Please respond to Gary if you are at least interested in hearing what he has 
to say.[his email address is listed below]

&gt;Pat: please publish.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You guys are fast! The net is unreal, I woke up in the next millenium in
&gt;this e-commerce buzz... wow.
&gt;
&gt;I sharpened up my spreadsheet, and came up with this.
&gt;
&gt;stripped T4 bus kit
&gt;$510
&gt;
&gt;includes all custom machined or assembled parts as std T4 kit
&gt;-brackets
&gt;-powder coated intake runners
&gt;-fuel lines for hi pressure, main feed, injector and warmup loop
&gt;-modified air meter w/o fuel distributor (for correct air cooled 
&gt;enrichment)
&gt;-custom adaptors, etc..
&gt;
&gt;does not include
&gt;-any unmodified mechanical, fuel or air component from any source
&gt;-pump
&gt;-filters
&gt;-gaskets or seals
&gt;-fuel distributor
&gt;-warmup regulator
&gt;-injectors
&gt;-throttle or plenum
&gt;-air boots
&gt;-air ducts
&gt;-air filter box
&gt;-bolts
&gt;-clamps
&gt;
&gt;You accountants will figure out I scrounge for pretty cheap, and make my
&gt;money off the
&gt;parts I have more investment in tooling, design, etc..
&gt;
&gt;You will still need all the skills listed in my insallation manual, plus
&gt;the ability to find 397 little geegaws.
&gt;
&gt;Please reply on the relative interest to the $670 complete kit.
&gt;
&gt;Gary
