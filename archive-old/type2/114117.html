Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Buying Scams

&gt;I have my bus listed on www.thesamba_dot_com and www.type2_dot_com. I have 
&gt;received  several strange e-mails from people stating that they are 
&gt;brokers or collectors. One persistent fellow wants to buy the bus sight 
&gt;unseen with a cashiers check and send an agent to pick it up. The catch is 
&gt;he wants to send a cashiers check for $10,000 and have me mail back one 
&gt;for the difference between the check and the selling price of the bus. 
&gt;Yeah, right.
&gt;
&gt;Another fellow claims to be a&quot; west German &quot;(sic) residing in west Africa. 
&gt;He has an _at_aol_dot_com address. Should I tell him Germany has reunified and he 
&gt;can go home? Perhaps he is legit but.........

Those are Nigerian style scams. In the end, you send them the vehicle and 
the refund and a month later you bank comes back with news that the 
original check has bounced and they want payment for the funds you sent 
overseas. You lose your funds and they vehicle. Beware.

Google for 411+Nigerian or 419+Nigerian if you want to do some reading.
