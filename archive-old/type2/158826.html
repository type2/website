Do you have a picture of this?  I've never really liked the sparkplug
location, but I haven't seen anything else, really.  Not having a CHT
at all, I'm in no place for judgments, but I was just curious about how
the folded sensor was secured, how deep down against the head you put
it, does the fold interupt the sensor's abilities, you know that kinda
stuff.

Thanks,
