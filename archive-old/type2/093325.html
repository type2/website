Subject: Re: [T2] Exterior door mirror question


&gt;I had one good one and one bad one.  Then someone took
&gt;a baseball bat to the good one (go figure)
&gt;
&gt;I took it off straightened it with a hammer, took it
&gt;into a glass place and got it black siliconed in
&gt;place.  Cost me $5.00 CDN  or 0.25 USD :).
&gt;
&gt;Not super duper pretty, but Im bac to one good one and
&gt;one bad one

Now that is a GREAT solution. I like the cost and done right it should look 
just fine.

I have a great glass place here in town that I've used several times.
