Subject: 1600 rebuild question
Message-ID: &lt;374C2E79.B2C65652_at_netzero_dot_com&gt;

Hello all,
I'm at the point of putting my 1600 Type 1 engine back together.  The
case has been align-bored .020&quot; over, the crank is ground .020&quot; under.

The problem is when I get it together the crank is binding.  I can't
turn it over using the flywheel.  When I release the torque on the two
main bearing studs at the flywheel end, it magically turns again.  At
first I thought it might be the new camshaft because it failed the
walkout test (i.e. when I rotated the engine backwards, the cam walked
out of the bearings).  So today I tried it with my old camshaft, and it
passed the walkout test and had a small amount of backlash play.

I bolted it together and as soon as I got 15 ft-lbs on the main bearing
studs and 14 ft-lbs on the small cam studs it bound up.  When I released
the torque on the two rear main bearing studs, it was free to turn
again.

All the main bearings are seated correctly in their saddles.  I'm
beginning to worry that the align bore is not straight or the crankshaft
is not straight.  How can I verify this?  

I also noticed after rotating the crank a few times with the case
together but the studs not torqued that when I removed the #1 main
bearing (rear most) from the end of the crank, it has an
inside-outside-inside wear pattern on the bearing surface in the form of
shiny spots, where it must have been rubbing.  This is why I'm starting
to worry that the crank or align-bore is not straight.

Any input will be appreciated.
