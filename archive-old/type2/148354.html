Subject: Re: [T2] Barrett Jackson results

My friend built a vehicle and to get title it had to be registered as
the year it was custom built and approved with a DMV / BAR assigned
VIN, which was 1995 or so. It had to be sold to an Arizona buyer to
get out from under smog requirements, though I think they did let him
smog it to the standards of the 1960 engine he had in it.

On a similar note, my military 181 was misidentified as a 73 due to
the issue of 73 / 74 being the only two years of US import and 73
being the year w/o heater muffs, and the German army applying their
own VIN, but I later found a VW applied VIN stamped on the body
indicating it is a 70.
