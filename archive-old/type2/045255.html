&gt; I've been told that it might be ok to do only the severely worn cylinder's 
&gt; rings, and hone the existing cylinder, as a short-term solution.  But....
I bought a '79 Adventurewagen about two years ago.  I purchased it from a 
local wrecking yard.  They had towed it from the original owners front yard 
where it had been sitting for about 8 years.  It had 73,000 miles on it.  It 
needed a rebuild.  My plan was to fix it and sell it.
The main problem with the engine was that the # 3 exhaust valve seat had 
collapsed up into the exhaust port.  I measured the clearance between the 
pistons and cylinders and found that # 3 was .020&quot;.  The spec. I believe is 
.003&quot;.  I honed and replaced rings anyway on all four cylinders.  The bus ran 
great when I got it back together.  It didn't use oil, ran really strong but 
it had piston slap.  It sounded like rod knock and I couldn't sell it like 
that.  I had to pull the engine again and replace pistons and cylinders.  I 
don't know how long the engine would have run like that.  My feeling is that 
it would have lasted 20,000 to 30,000 miles.
I hope this helps you make your decision.
