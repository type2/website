Subject: Re: [T2] Exaust Leak


Guys,

This is good to know as I will be doing this on my 78 2l 1-2 side shortly.

has anyone had good luck putting this back together with the copper 
8mm nuts?

I plan to use the hot wax method to get mine off as espoused by Bill May
over on the vintagevw list.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Whoops!!!  Al is absolutely correct on both points and I left them out of
&gt; mine.  I'd change the order...
&gt; 
&gt; First, SAFETY GLASSES!!!  first and foremost!  and goggles are better...
&gt; there is always a lot of rust down there and you don't want an
&gt; opthalmoligist flicking at your eye with a steel needle, do you? (BTDT)
&gt; 
&gt; Second, heat. Al is better at this than I am, he has a proper torch (and
&gt; lovely assistant :-), so this works better for him, but a propane torch
&gt; will definitely improve things.  Red heat, then hit it with the socket
&gt; while it is hot as he said.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never used sealer, but it may well help... I will look into this for
&gt; next time.  And the brackets come under &quot;of course!&quot;  If they are not
&gt; there, you are certain to be back down there in a couple months.
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, I just remembered, John and I found metric stainless nuts when we
&gt; installed my engine 2 years ago, and I gotta tell ya'... they are the
&gt; cat's meow on subsequent removals!  They won't help this time, but are
&gt; definitely worth looking for if you plan on keeping the bus.
