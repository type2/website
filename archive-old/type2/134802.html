Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solexes and 2L engine

Anyone outside the US running CJ and CU engines basically has 72-74 Solexes
on a 2L. Carbs are pretty much the same, possibly jetted slightly different,
but they should work.

Jetting for CU (2L Vanagon):

Venturi (Lufttrichter): 26mm
Main jet (Hauptd|se): X 135 or X 132.5
Air correction jet (Luftkorrekturd|se): 140
Idle jet (Leerlaufkraftstoffd|se): 50
Idle air jet (Leerlaufluftd|se): 140
Extra fuel jet (Zusatzkraftstoffd|se) - left carb only: 45
Extra air jet (Zusatzluftd|se) - left carb only: 0.7
Float valve (Schwimmernadelventil): 1,2 mm

If I remember correctly, carb linkages came in at least two different
lenghts. I am not sure whether the length depends on whether it is a 1.8 or
2.0 or whether it is associated with different manifolds.

I have at least one set of 2.0 CJ carbs and manifolds in Germany. If you are
interested I could bring them to the US when I return from my Christmas
trip.

BTW, my book lists the tuning information for this engine: CO = 0.6 +/- 0.3
at 900 RPM. That means that even a dual-carb engine with no emissions
equipment whatsoever should be able to pass California smog. So, if anyone
is in the 3% CO range, that engine is severely out of tune and ought to
fail.

On my own 2L I am running modified Solexes from a late 412 (36-40 PDSIT;
engine code AT). No central idle and larger throats.

Has anyone run 72-74 dual solexes on a 2L engine?
