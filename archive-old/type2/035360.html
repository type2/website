Subject: spark enhancer? better mileage?

Anybody have experience with the enhanced ignition system
advertized in J.C. Whipme? For about $250, the Jacobs Electronics
device called &quot;Omni Magnum Team&quot; is supposed to boost your
mileage and horsepower. It claims to do this by &quot;adding a small 
computer and coil system that measures the spark resistance 
at each plug, sending just the right number of joules to the 
spark plug.&quot; Sounds a little like wizardry to me. Maybe I'm
wrong. Is it worth $250?
