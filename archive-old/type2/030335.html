Terry, 

If you are thinking &quot;whole hog&quot;, I advise going FI!  It takes a parts bus
nearby, but I gotta say, you will love it!  My '73 has an entire
transplanted '78 powertrain and, until the motor gave out, it was
excellent!  The transplant was not that difficult, tho it really helps to
have, as I said, a parts bus for all the bits you will need.  Some of it
is obvious, like the FI gas tank, and wiring harness, other bits are
obscure, like you need to flop the gas tank cover panel and will need to
chisel off and screw or weld on the air filter mount (not to mention the
clip that holds the FI computer into place), but I do regard it as both
do-able and worth the effort!

You've done enough.  Have you no sense of decency, sir?  
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
