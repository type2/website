Subject: Pilot bearing... what's left anyway

Today I managed to get up enough gumption to go out and tackle the flywheel 
removal on my 1.7L. Came off fine (BTW, a handle for a floor jack works great 
as a leverage bar - at least in my case). After lurking on the list for a 
while and seeing the subject talked about, I checked the pilot bearing. Well, 
there is little to nothing left of it. What I pulled out of there was trash. 
I mean there was nothing but bits of metal. One piece **kinda** looked like 
it might have been a bearing. Now the problem is how to get the rest of it 
out so that I can put the new one in (that I picked up just in case - patting 
myself on the back for that one). Any helpful hints? I hope so, because I'm 
not touching this one until I hear something... and I'm hoping to get my 
Westy on the road soon, 'cause some people are starting to believe that I 
don't really have one (not directed at Snoopy in **any** way)
