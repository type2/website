Subject: Any interest in Wide 5 Wheel Balancing adapter 

      I remember a few weeks ago there were some threads on wide 5 wheel 
balancing and the lack of tire shops having the adapters to spin balance 
the wide 5 rims.
       Anyway, when going through some of the multitudes of &quot;stuff&quot; my 
father has collected over the last 70 years I found an adapter for wide 
  5 rims to be used for balancing. This one adapter will be for sale in 
the near future once I finish reverse engineering the item so look for a 
post on that soon. What I am really interested in is if any number of 
people out there would be interested in owning their own wide 5 
balancing adapter. I beleive I could produce these adapters for a 
selling price of about $60 ea. in low quantities.
	If anyone out there would be interested in purchasing an adapter in 
that price range, let me know.If enough people are interested to make it 
economical to produce, I will let everyone know.

	Keep in mind, this is not a wide 5 to different bolt pattern wheel 
adapter; this is designed specifically to bolt onto a wide 5 rim for the 
purpose of balancing. It is made from aluminum and is precision made and 
balanced on its own so as not to influence the balance readings of the 
wheel itself.

Let me know- Jeff
