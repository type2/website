Collie:

The engine you have is most likely from a Type 4 wagon or fastback (411 or
412)  These were offered in the U.S. in the early 1970's.

&gt; I recently put what I thought was a 1974 1800 bus engine into my 1972
&gt; camper. Why I never noticed, but I didnt, but the oil filler is not in
&gt; the usual place (coming out below the alternator). It is on top of the
&gt; block just above the alternator. Does anyone know why the filler is
&gt; there? Is it from a type III?
