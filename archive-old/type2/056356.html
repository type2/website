Subject: Miles per gallon

I've gone through all 7 steps and still no answer, so,   I'm the new
owner of a '79 Westphalia.  I promise to ask these basics only once.
Basically I need to know what to expect.

This bus was sold to me with the claim that it had a freshly rebuilt
engine with less than 5,000 miles on it.  I'm beginning to wonder.  My
gas mileage has been around 13 to 14 MPG.  This has been in California's
Antelope Valley (pretty flat and 50 to 60  MPH.  No oil usage.  Haven't
really found a knowledgeable mechanic around here so I thought I could
get some advise on what to expect here on this list.  A.  What should I
expect as average gas mileage (2.0 litre engine)?  B.  Can anyone
recommend a mechanic in the Lancaster/Palmdale CA area?  I went to the
supposed &quot;best &quot; mechanic up here.  He was actually a Mercedes guy who
treated me like I was slumming to even have a VW Bus.  He said the
engine tested out with 110 to 120 compression in 3 cylinders and 100 to
105 in the 4th.  Thanks for your help
