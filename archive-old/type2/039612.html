Subject: fuel pump runs?

When you turn the key to &quot;on&quot;, and the vehicle has not yet been started,
is the fuel pump supposed to run forever?  On my fords, the pump primes
for five seconds or so.  But the bus will run all day long.  What's that
all about?  Could this be part of my hesitation /stall problem?  I've
been thinking it's the pressure regulator, but that's a $60 part that I
want to make sure is broken before I replace.

Thanks,
