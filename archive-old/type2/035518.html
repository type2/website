Subject: Frustration... '80 Vanagon won't start 

Volks, 

I am at my wits end.  The '80 won't start and I don't know why :-( This is
part of the continuing series of problems that I believe the FI has been
giving me since I got the van.  All summer long, it ran lean and hot (Oil
= 250 at 60mph).  As the weather cooled down, the oil temps cooled right
along with them (210 _at_ 65mpg; air temp &lt;50), the engine felt like it was
getting more gas and the O2 meter on the dash said it was running richer.  
Thes past two weeks, the temps here have dropped below freezing and the
van will not start at all.  The engine is the MSHP Stage II in an '80
V'gon but the FI (AFM and Computer) is from an '81 federal bus.

What I have checked: (note all checks were static or while cranking)
Dwell = 50 
Timing ~8 BTDC
spark visually verified
Gas pressure = 30+psi at the tap between 3&amp;4

A couple weeks ago, the van would kick at the start of cranking, but not
start.  If I then depressed the gas half way and cranked it would start
after 10-20 seconds.  Now it does not kick, and if I crank for 30+
seconds, with the gas pedal fully depressed, it will buck a bit but not
start.  After this cranking, the rear of the bus smells heavily of
gasoline.

I *think* it is flooding almost instantly.  I further think that if I
could get a 40 degree day it would start, but I would *like* to cure this
problem, whaterver it is.  Any ideas???
