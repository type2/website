Subject: Re: Bus Radio--

If anyone wants a crappy stock AM radio to put in the hole in their
dash, I've still got the Sapphire (I think it's a XV but it's in the
bottom of my spare parts box at the moment and I don't feel like digging
it out) and you can have it for nothing. Will ship. No problemo.
