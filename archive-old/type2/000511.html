Subject: busted bus

Hi everybody.  Thankyou  Doyt, Joe, Jaime, Roland for advice; even I feel
down (some of you might know this feeling - the girlfriend gives you an
ultimatum :commitment or else and you do not know if you are well prepared
for the first and afraid that a similar relationship is not going to come
around again ) I feel lucky to belong to a caring family (type2).
Additional inf..about the incident : I was driving slow , flat street 2-3
min.after I start when the engine dies, all dashlights  on, no special
noises only some kind of hesitation/low vibrations, the engine brake is
slowing down the car, after about 10 yards it feel like going over a small
bump and now the car rolls free and I stop it with the breaks.  I could not
start it again,bring it home, order Hayes and T.Wilson, I notice that the
speed selector works only in P ( all other positions are like N - you can
move the bus back and forth with little effort ), I go to the generator and
try to move the fun - similar procedure as static timing and I notice that
the engine is locked with the belt slipping when try to turn the engine.
What is next? What tests are left? If I drop the engine, what work is needed
( the patient is sick but there no diagnostic ) ?
