Subject: RE: [T2] Air Vent Covers?

I also have a set of these covers. I have not used them, but I think that
they use a large washer to go on the inside of the vent and you just tighten
the bolt to hold them on. They are designed for winter. My thought was to
try the set in the winter to help with the progressive carb preheater issue,
but I think that I am just going to change the carb. They should keep out
most rain, but they are also keeping out cool fresh for the carb and heater
system. Not sure if this matters since they do allow some air in. I think
they actually are made by VW, but I cannot find mine to get the part number
off of it. They are advertised as being made by VW on Ebay.
