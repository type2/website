Subject: Joining rubber parts

Hi List,

I am looking into purchasing some &quot;rubber diamondplate&quot; roll.  It's 4 ft
wide and comes in rolls up to 50 feet or so.  I wan to put some in the bed
of my doublecab, and I need to make a piece about 5' x 5'.  Can I just use
rubber cement and glue the two edges together, reinforced with fiberglass on
the backside?  Is there some other trick?  Or am I stuck with the edges of
my bed exposed to the cargo in the bed?

Thanks for the continued help you all provide,

Paul
