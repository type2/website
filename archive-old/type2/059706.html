Subject: What Else for Heat??
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Helloo,
  I need heat in 'Mona soon and am wondering what else I need to get to have
it good.
  I had to have her whole exhaust sys. replaced last year and in doing so also
had to replace the heater boxes since they were rotted out....But that's all
they replaced.
  The mechanic inferred that all I needed to hook it up and have it working
was the heat tuber that travel the under-bus. True?
  I need to do this myself, and any advice would be the swellest.
Thanks,
Rach &amp; Ramona
