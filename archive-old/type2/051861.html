Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info (low ceiling)

If the bus is still FI you will not need to jack it up as much as if it has
been converted to carbs.  If it has been converted to carbs and ceiling
clearance is a problem you will have to remove the carb or you will never
get it high enough to clear.
