Subject: Mercedes bus that looks like a vw??

I have seen a bus driving the streets of Southern California that looks like
a vw bus, but with a mercedes grill and emblem on the front.  Is there such
a thing?? or is it someones chop-job?

I searched the web for info on a benz-bus but could only find newer stuff.
Some of which closely resembled what I saw, but wasn't quite the same.

Thanks
Gabe
