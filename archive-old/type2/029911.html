&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Here's another idea.  Remove the screen altogether and duct tape the fresh 
&gt; air vents like I did on my Bus.  Up here in the mountains of Colorado, I was 
&gt; getting some serious wind thru the fresh air vents during the winter (now) 
&gt; no matter what position the blue lever was in.  If you need fresh air, open 
&gt; the windows.

One slick solution I saw was a fellow who got a strip of the flexible
magnetic plastic that they make removable sings from.  He cut it to the
shape of the grille and simply sticks it on when he wants to seal it up.  
When not in use he just sticks it to the sheetmetal of the nose.
