Subject: Oil in the air cleaner

For david gibson and Greg Noll:

In my old 68 and with the original carbs on my 72 there was an orange line
inside the air cleaner. That's how much oil you put in. It was bout 1/2
inch (3 cm) up from the bottom. If the oil cleaner is really dirty or has
rusted you may not see the line.
