Subject: Angle Grinder and Door Handle Removal

I bought an angle grinder today after the recommendation by James. It works
good, but it can grind off some of the metal. I try to keep it moving after
the paint is gone and keep the sparks down to a minimum.

Does anyone know where I can find step by step instructions on how to remove
the outside door handle?

I also started a blog to keep track of my progress. I would appreciate
anyone that wants to keep track of my work and comment on it through the
blog. Thanks for all the help given so far.
