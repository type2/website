Subject: part needed: arm rest for middle bench seat

Once again I turn to the list for a part request.  I'll be restoring my 
seats which have never had the arm rest.  Just a cold metal post.  The 
problem is no local yards have this I assume because, as seats are quick 
to go naturally the arm rest goes with them.  Same story on ebay... 
always sold complete.  This one is black for a standard bay middle two 
person bench seat of course.  Mine is a 76 but I'm not aware of any 
changes.  pmail. All offers considered.
