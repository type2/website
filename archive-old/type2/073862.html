Well, I have another problem.......the engine bleeding
oil!  Looks like its coming from underside of #3 cyl,
but I don't want to look.  

Looks like this engine is coming out!  Thank heavens
this is not my daily driver!

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.  I will let
you know how this all works out.

Sam
