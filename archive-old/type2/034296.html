&gt; it 
&gt; right now, but I'm going on a trip from Pa to Florida in a few days. 
&gt; I was 
&gt; wondering if anybody has experienced this before on a 2 litre FI
&gt; engine. Its 
&gt; a 79.

If the oil is cold, it takes a few seconds for the oil pressrure to
bleed down to the point where the oil pressure switch closes.  It is
not a concern as long as the light does come on in a few seconds.
