Subject: Sermons requiem

I read with great sorrow today of Bob Hoover's  decision to take the
Sermons off the web.  I have found them to be a source of inspiration and
wisdom, VW and otherwise.  My 71 westy has a Hoover starter relay, rerouted
fuel supply hoses, and other modifications, because St. Hoover's eloquence
convinced me they were necessary.  It does not have chrome anything.  It
works, every day.

Bob is more than a mechanic, he is a writer.  I am inspired by his words to
write my own, to take a chance and publish them in a public forum.  I am
inspired by his words to take tools in my own hands and fix and modify my
bus.  Without the Sermons to guide me I will have to learn some things the
hard way.  I have downloaded a few Sermons for immediate personal reference
but only a few.  The rest of his wisdom is now lost to me, it seems.  I am
in mourning.

This is more than a requiem though.  I have some thoughts.

Could the Sermons remain on line if Mr. Hoover's email address was not made
available?  I realise this leaves people's legitimate questions unanswered,
but at least the those wishing to send hate mail would have to really work
to find him.

If the Sermons were published, and perhaps revised, annotated, etc. by the
author, how many of you would buy a copy?  How much would you be willing to
pay for such a concentrated package of down to earth, clearly written VW
wisdom?    Surely it is worth at least as much as St. Muir's often
questionable lore? Net access costs me $20cdn/month, I would be willing to
pay substantially more than that for such a reference work.

Let's try to find an agreeable solution to this.
