&amp;gt; BTW, where does that used veggie oil go if not into someone's tank...I know
&amp;gt; my

&amp;gt; think
&amp;gt; of using it... ;-(

It probably wouldn't hurt a thing to burn veggie oil.  After all, we eat a
goodly amount of it whenever we enjoy an order of fries!

Traditionally, waste oil goes to a rendering plant where it is converted
into base materials for other products such as pharmceuticals and
cosmetics.

It isn't well publicised, but most &amp;quot;recycled&amp;quot; motor oil is used as bunker
fuel for ships, so it ends up being burned anyway!
