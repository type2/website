Subject: Rocker assembly nut torque?

After replacing the pushrod tube seals on my typeIV motor, and then
reassembling the rocker assembly and torquing the nuts to 10ft lbs (as per
Muir and Haynes).  I was a little surprised to find the motor running on
three cylinders (the next day , 5psi cylinder #1) and that one of the nuts
had worked its way all the way off a stud and another was extremely loose.

Is 10 ft lbs the correct torque?

Could my torque wrench be at fault?

Has anyone experienced this before?

I torqued the nuts up tp 15 ft lbs, and triple checked this. Oh and I did
reset the valve clearances as I did the first time, they barely needed
adjusting.

Thanks for any suggestions or comments.
