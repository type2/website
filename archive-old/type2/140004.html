&gt; In many years of working on VW's, I have never had to have a flywheel 
&gt; resurfaced.  The most I have ever done is to use about 300 grit wet dry 
&gt; sandpaper to rough up the surface a little, or to make sure there is not 
&gt; any sort of glaze on it.
&gt;

 hello Guys  This is just like looking at a disc brake rotor and saying it 
looks good  LOL   If you dont mount it in a lathe or flywheel grinder then you 
cant tell how bad it is  I have a peterson flywheel grinder in my shop and 
surface all kinds of flywheels , I have seen hundreds of VW flywheels that looked 
good only to see the truth when grinding them . The only way to tell if it is 
good is to grind it.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
