Subject: Re: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

I have only ordered a couple of things for my long-out-of-production 
78 Westy from Ron, but I second this writer's opinion of their 
service.

I've been restoring and driving vintage cars for over 20 years and 
have never found a dealer like this.    He's a treasure compared to 
the folks I had to buy Alfa Romeo and Mazda Rx7 parts from!

Give him a break and remember while we're at it that we do drive 
antique vehicles.  If it were not for the folks like Ron and Busted 
Bus and the others, we'd all be grinding our own parts in our garages 
like the owners of Alfas and British cars need to!
