&gt; Why on earth would you want to install a BN2 heater in a Beetle? Beetles
get
&gt; warm as toast on their own exhaust heater exchange. BN2s were designed for
&gt; the larger and chillier buses, especially for camping. Am I missing
&gt; something here?  Jan B


Yes. I am Making a stroker motor, and I need to upgrade my exhaust to 1
5/8&quot;.Berg makes bigger heater boxes, but they are very pricey, and since I
already own a BN2, I figured this would be by far the most economical
solution.

You are right about the stock heat.Mine will burn you out of the van.however
it is a restriction on a performance engine...........

&gt;
&gt; i am looking for a copy of the template and tech manual for a BN2 heater.I
&gt; am installing in a 74 Beetle...............
