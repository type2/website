Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats &amp; more

After looking at two 82 vanagons next to my 82 westy I noted some 
differences.  The vanagon could have swivel seats installed like the 
ones on the westy.  If it has the swivel seats you rotate then 90 
degrees in and then release the latches and slide them out. Then the 
base can be removed.  The swivel mechanism is held down by 4 13mm nuts.  
If it doesnt have the swivel you will find that the seat rails are solid 
seat track that is part of the body.  As for engine stuff I have been 
finding that much of the CV engine is unique to 80-83 vanagon/westy.  
The heads however list as a 79 - 83 part.

&gt; I'm hittin' the road this weekend to visit a friend
&gt; and an 82 Vanagon he has on his farm.  I'll probably
&gt; take the front seats home with me for my 79.  What
&gt; tools do I need to remove the front seats?  Should
&gt; I take the seat tracks and all?
&gt; Also, will the sliding door interior panel from the 82
&gt; fit my 79?
&gt; Eventually I plan to drag this van home with me. I have
&gt; a 78 engine in my van, could I just take the shortblock
&gt; from the 82 and put my 78 heads on it?
&gt; Thanks,
