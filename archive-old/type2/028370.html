People,
	The end users situation can be pretty basic in internet terms, you know,
some poor sod with the first portable computer ever made holding a
microphone over a public phone earpiece and deeply needing VW help. If the
info is in some sophisticated format accessible only by a Cray no point
really. KIS I say.

&gt;
&gt; A spreadsheet is not the way to go! The AIRS list should be backed by a
&gt; database with some CGI scripts at the front that let you search
&gt; on anything
&gt; you want. They should also allow people to edit their own entry
&gt; using some
&gt; form of authentication. (A password at creation time, or emailed to the
&gt; user are both easy to set up.) It would be really cool to be able
&gt; to enter
&gt; some information about a trip you are taking and have it give you a list
&gt; for that trip. But with a good search feature people should be
&gt; able to find
&gt; what they need.
&gt;
&gt; A simple perl script would be able to read the list in it's current form
&gt; into a database in no time at all. I would love to help with such a
&gt; project, but would want to get the okay first so as not to steal the
&gt; current admin's thunder. I have a BS in Computer Engineering, so
&gt; I think I
&gt; am qualified. :~) I am sure that I could have it up in running in a
&gt; weekend. Beat that time to market!
