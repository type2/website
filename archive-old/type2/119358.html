Subject: Re: [T2] Empi nylock engine nut kits

&lt;&lt; Is there any reason to NOT use the Nylock nut kits from Empi on my Type1 
1600 engine case? At 6.95 for a complete new nut set, I'm very tempted to use 
them. Would appreciate any reasons pro or con about using them, from those who 
have.

 I'm not familiar with the EMPI Nylocks, specifically, but Nylocks are a one
time only fastener; if that matters...
