Subject: [T2] Re: Diesel conversion

Hi Volks!

Ulf Nyman wrote to the List:
&gt; I've heard rumours about a Diesel converted bus here in
&gt; Finland. The tale says they used the &quot;clutch housing&quot; (bellhousing?)from a
&gt; diesel Vanagon on the loaf transaxle. With a combination of clutch parts
&gt; &gt;from the loaf and the vanagon no special conversion kits are needed. Can
&gt; anybody confirm this?

Yes, I can.  There are a good dozen such converted loafs
(loaves?) running in Germany.  A friend of mine, Jens
Pöplow, built a dozen of them on a semi-professional
basis.  He wrote a conversion how-to that he sells for
DM 125 IIRC (that's about US$60), and which we always
meant to translate, but we haven't gotten around to 
doing so yet.

The price for the parts needed -- apart from the
engine itself -- is around DM 1.500, or so he says.
The recommended way to do it is to get a Diesel Vanagon
parts car.  So -- it's decidedly non-trivial, but it
can be and has been done, and Jens' own conversion,
now 400k kilometres and ten years old, is still running
fine (albeit on its third -- used -- engine).

P-mail me for additional information.  Seems we'll
have to put up a web site sometime, huh?

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
