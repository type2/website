From: &quot;Terry K.&quot; &lt;CTONLINE_at_webtv_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Now I come to all the gurus of chemical warfare--how in the heck do I
&gt; get it off, without putting the material into nuclear melt?

Terry, I market a quality line of CA (cyanoacrylate) glues made by Bob Smith
Industries out in California.  A large number of hobby shops carry their
glue and epoxy lines.

BSI markets a product called &quot;Un-Cure&quot; for dissolving cured CA glues.  It's
not acetone-based that I can tell, though it still affects paint and some
plastics.  You'd need to test it on a non-visible piece of the seat fabric
before trying it on the glue spots.

It's also happens to be better at ungluing fingers without eating skin than
acetone is. :O)
