List,
I will soon enter the world of adventurewagen owners.  See
http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/71.html
For pics of the 71 i should have next week.  
She'll need a little nose work and maybe a new door - besides that, she's
solid.
This reminds me - who out there has run a big (1776+) type1 in a bus?  Issues?
Will it stay cool?
Thinking of building an 1835 off a fullcircle crank (if my buddy will part
with it). Any pitfalls/watch-out-fors?
thanks,

clark
