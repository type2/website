Subject: [T2] RE: Friday question

Regarding the question about how much a Westy is worth,
and a response about how much a restoration is worth, I thought
I'd pass on this.

I was out getting some parts at local VW restoration place, 
where they were just doing the finishing touches  on a ground up total
restoration on a convertible beetle. It was beautiful. Every part under the
car was fully painted in the original factory color. Every pipe, suspension 
piece, cooling tin .. everything. Up top it was even nicer.
I asked what the restoration had cost, and the reply was
&quot;Just over $25,000.00&quot;
I asked what it was worth, and the response was
&quot;Oh about half that&quot;.
I said WHAT and he said
&quot;You do a restoration like this because you love the car, and have to have
one.
You don't do this as an investment, and even if you have to have one, try to
find
one that has already been restored that is for sale, because it will cost
you about half as much&quot;.

So I've got a question: 
What is an unrestored, original paint, original brakes, original tires 
excellent condition 76 non Westy bus worth?

Cheers Bill Crick
