Ok, so it's Friday, I finally get to ask...

How far have people driven with their pop tops up?

I just got back from a weekend of camping down Santa Cruz/ Big Sur, and one
evening after the drive-in, I was tired and forgot to take down the pop top
('76 Westy, so it's a huge air dam when it's up).  So there I was, cruising
down Hwy 1, trying to figure out why I couldn't get the bus to go over 55,
and what was that damn squeaking noise coming from the back?  My wife fell
asleep during the second movie, and was still asleep in the back (she'll
sleep through anything), so she didn't even notice.  But just before my
exit, I realized that the top was still up.  I had gone about 10 miles down
#1 with nary a problem.  Got to the campsite, checked everything out, and it
was all fine.  Gotta love the Westy :-)  Boy did my wife laugh when I woke
her up and told her what I had done.

Later,
N.
