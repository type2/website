Subject: Re: [T2] [t2]Rebuilt engine still stalls

Think you should find the problem in the fuel system,
why didn't he tune it, a rough set will run without
stalling, might overheat from the timing, I've done
too many of them to believe your mechanic, he should
have whipped out the timing light and set the
timing,and tweeked the carb that's all that is
required, the valves should be adjusted. If it's fuel
injected there is a problem with the components.  Phil
