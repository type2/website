Subject: Traumwagen

After many years of being a wannabusser I'm finally getting my first one.
It's an '80 Westy which I found with the help of the list.  It is definitely
going to be a project and you all will probably be hearing from me in the
future.  First of all the current owner is anxious to to sell and is not
asking a whole lot for it - which is great cause I can't afford to dump
whole lot of $$ at this time.  He could get more for it by parting it out,
but he'd rather see it sold intact to someone like me who wants to put it
back together.  Given that, I've looked it over and tho it has some unknown
and known problems, I want to grab it.  Here's what I don't know about it:
Whether it will run or not.  Isn't at present. I'm planning to tow it home
and then go to work checking out the engine, etc.  He told me that he had
the valves done (not sure when) and that the engine is &quot;strong&quot; (hmmm).  Oil
pan is coated with a layer of oil/dirt.  tail pipe replaced with water pipe.
Electric fuel pump unplugged, no battery.  Will it steer, stop, even roll?
Questionable front end, don't know what the brakes look like and the tires
may not hold air;  there's no spare tire.  Here's what I know: It's cheap.
Typical surface rust; several rust throughs especially on driver side panel
where water/electric utilities are; small ding in front corner.  Complete,
though schmutzig interior - curtains, screens; table, cabinets.  Cracked
windshield.  Poptop canvas in tact.  Tires/shocks questionable.  Although
water pipe for tail pipe, other piping (especiall heat exchangers) looked
good - no rust.  Eberspacher gas heater - I'll probably want to remove/sell
this.  Doors/hatch appear and feel solid; gas struts hold up tailgate as tho
new.  So that's the background.  Here's question #1 for the list:  I'll be
picking it up this weekend and will be towing it about 70 miles using a
rented car dolly.  Any advice on this procedure?  We'll have to push it up
onto the dolly.  Front end up, trans. in neutral??  That's the plan.  TIA
for your feedback.
