Subject: westi cabinet parts

Last fall, I picked up some cabinets originally for a '69 or '70
Westifalia.  They are in better shape than the cabinets in my '72 bus.
They smelled musty though, so I aired them and gave them some old fashioned
sunshine over the winter.  They still smell musty.

My better half's patience has worn out.  I've got to get rid of them (toss
them, I guess).  If anyone wants them - it's bacically a complete set -
free for the taking.  Email me directly this week and we can work out you
picking them  up.  I live in central VT.

Sean
