Subject: Cheap/Easy HP boosters? 

I'm really enjoying some of these threads! But they've got me thinking.
What all mod's  have ya'll done to increase HP/Performance of your
engines? Or are their any REALLY good ones for MPG? I live in an erea
where we don't have to take emissions, so I can play around with more
stuff than those who have to pass smogg tests. :) I've heard various
rumors, has anyone here actually tried any of these or know of any
others? 
 
Disconnect the Charcoal Canister from the intake. 
Turn the Full Throttle Valve to always on or always off, I forget witch.

Disconnect the EGR valve so you don't re-burn gasses.
Install Full Flow/Unbaffled muffler.
Install Electronic Ignition (i.e. pertronix)
I put split-fire plugs into my honda once. Made a big differance, do
they do much in VW engines? 
I've heard mixed reports on .009 distro's. What about Porche distro's
and/or OTHER Bosches?
 
Any other ideas/myths/theories/methods? 
 
This should be a fun thread! :) 
Chris
