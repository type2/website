I am also a long way away from this event, but I agree that it is a good
idea. Maybe it will draw a little attention to what is going on. If I had an
emblem on the front of my bus, I would cover it all the time. I have a tire
on the front, so I cannot help out yet. I could remove the tire, get an
emblem, and cover it....

How can VW have the rights to the words &quot;bug&quot; and &quot;bus&quot;? I can only see them
taking action against the V over W sign.

while i will be a long, long way from this event, i do think this is the
best idea presented so far.  if there are alot of acvw's there with black
cloth covering the emblem, the news media at the event is likely to ask
questions.

someone mentioned renting out a vendor spot in the event to distribute
literature, etc.  i also think this is a very good idea. but be careful -
apparently there are some real sticky legal situations surrounding this
event, so watch your back.
