Subject: Atlanta 2 Canada,  trip report

Hi all,
Just returned from a great week long bus trip from Atlanta to the
Canadian border via Minnesota. After ignoring the advise and offers from
family and friends of free airline tickets etc. My roommate &quot;Evan&quot;, his
year old Golden Labrahoundador &quot;Puck&quot; and I traveled in my '77 westy to
Minnesota. The bus ran great, better than great! This was the first long
trip since the new rebuilt engine was installed. I can not say enough
good things about AVP and this engine. I averaged 70mph!!!! This was
holding back, as their was more room to go faster and several times I
found that I was doing 75mph and chose to throttle back. 

I used just over a quart of oil on a close to 3000 mile round trip!!! I
changed the oil on arriving in MN, as well as set the valve gap.  This
was my first time setting the valve gap, my best friend in MN helped as
he has been setting his valves himself for years. They had tightened up
as suspected and advised by AVP. What a great feeling to do this myself!
I am going to recheck them Sat. morning. 

We drove up through TN, KY and what seems like an eternity in IL. Though
as boring as IL can be, it is nice and flat and the bus certainly
enjoyed that. Camped both coming and returning just outside Champaigne
at a rest area on 57. Going up to Minneapolis we drove through Wisconsin
and returning we chose to head through Iowa.

I joked to Evan that I wonder what Puck thinks about this, I suggested
that his thoughts would be along the lines of &quot;oh yeah, I remember doing
this, this is where we drive along way, then stop for a day while Scoob
gets really bummed out and then we drive home in a sedan&quot;. As Pucks lst
trip in the bus was the doomed engine blow out to DC this summer.

I use to carry a sun shower, a big bag that you fill with water and let
sit in the sun, heat up and suspend. I no longer bring this, instead I
use the truckers showers at the big truck stops. They usually end up
being free as I bring my own towels and toiletries. 

The best part of the trip was the drive up the North Shore of Lake
Superior, what beautiful scenery.  I personaly don't like camping at
state and national campgrounds as I do not like to camp near others.  We
drove around until about 2am on Friday looking for a nice private camp
site. We found a great spot on Thomsonite beach, a little pull off that
overlooks the lake. Popped the top and fell into a deep sleep listening
to the waves of Superior caress the shore.

We drove to the Candian border at Grand Portage, parked the bus on the
US side and walked across the bridge to take pictures (the obligatory
one foot in US..) walked back across and had the pleasure of being
invited into the beautiful US customs station by 2 nazi skin heads,,oops
I mean  US customs officers.  We enjoyed about an hour stay with them,
as we had the opportunity to tell them in great detail of everything
that we had done so far on our trip and our plans for the future.  They
were so delighted by our story that they asked us to show them the
contents of our pockets, and then they decided to pat us down and see if
we had gained any weight on the trip.  Well they checked our backgrounds
and finally decided to let us go on our way.  We left feeling angry,
violated and depressed.  It really brought my mood down for awhile that
day.  I am glad that we parked the bus, as I think we would still be
there putting it back together.  We need to change our motto from &quot;the
land of the free, home of the brave&quot; to &quot;land of the intimidated, home
of the scared&quot;.  

We shook off the bad taste the customs experience left us with and
camped on Beaver Bay.  The Beaver River is a great place to spend a day
hiking, as their are about 15 sets of waterfalls to see as you hike up
the river.  A nice pebble beach can be found at the mouth of the river
where it emptys into Superior.  We watched the full moon rise over the
the bay and then made a campfire on the river overlooking waterfalls.  

We traveled on Sunday to Gull Lake in Central MN, making stops along
Lake Superior at Palasade head which is a very high cliff over looking
Superior, Split rock lighthouse and Glensheen Mansion in Duluth. We
skipped the tour of the interior instead enjoying the grounds and
spending several hours walking the shoreline hunting for rocks and lake
glass.

Spent Sunday night at a friends family's compound on Gull lakes north
shore. Was the only night of the trip that we did not sleep in the bus,
enjoying a cute little lake side cottage.  Walleye sandwiches for
dinner! Our plan had been to just to stop by Gull and visit my friends
and continue home, but it was so nice that we had to stay the night.

Monday found us getting a late start after a hearty breakfast in Nisswa,
MN.  We headed to Minneapolis and again the beautiful cool weather
slowed our return as a walk around Lake Calhoun seemed to be the perfect
end to our stay in MN.  It also afforded Puck the chance to swim after
sticks one last time. We finally got on I35 at 4pm. I drove until about
4am. 

Our final day found the temperatures going back up as we headed south.
We arrived back in Atlanta  at 10:45 on Tuesday. What a great trip.  I
think that there is nothing I enjoy more than a road trip in the bus
with a great friend, good weather and a VW engine running in top shape.
peace,
scoob
