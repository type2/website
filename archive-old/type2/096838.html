Subject: Re; 81 slider window

Hello,

	This moss that I can't get to yet is located in the center of both
pieces of glass and on the synthetic felt seal. It runs about 4 inches from
the bottom upwards. I removed the top channel gasket/seal, the one that
goes along the top and down one side.
	To no avail, there was still not enough clearance to lift up and
out on the bottom of the plate of glass. I tried briefly to remove the
push-down latch ( 3 holes ) but couldn't find the right tool. But I don't
think that would help anyways.
	That Seattle moss can grow on the north side and the south side. I
just of of an alternate cleaning method. A big fat piece of dental floss
and some compressed air with a rinse or shot of bleach mix. The gray felt
seal on my windows needs replacing anyways and at a later date.

					Craig
