Subject: Install Update &amp; Questions

The install has gone well, although getting the engine in took a helluva
lot of work.  I think I did it right, though, since the engine starts,
runs, and even moves the car.  That's a major victory.

My problem right now is the tuning.  The first problem I'm getting is a
serious bit of run on after I turn the ignition off.  I'm guessing this
is due to a poor mixture (too rich?) but I'm not sure.  Any advice?

The second problem I've got is with the timing.  I have to use the new
050 (mechanical) distributor that I've got for now, since my old vaccuum
advance dizzy is tired.  I've searched the archives and library.  Now I
need your help.

The McKinley article on the 050 in the library is not clear.  He says
that the 050 advances to &quot;around 26 degrees at ~3100 rpm.&quot;  Is this how
I should time a pancake engine?  Is there a maximum advance which I
should aim for on a pancake?  I understand that mechanical distributors
ideally need to be timed at rpm, but how far should I do that?  All
advice on this matter is welcome.  I've got it timed right now to where
it is about 28 degrees at 3000 rpm, but I'm not comfortable with it, and
I'm looking for reassurance.

Thanks again for everyone's input and advice through my whole install
process.
