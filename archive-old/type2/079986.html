Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for the widest tire I can fit on my stock 1970 1
	4' rims.........

Was writ:
&quot;I am looking to buy a wider tire, for both looks and I plan on using the
truck on the farm in a few months............. 
Adam P&quot; 

The wider tire can be an issue since the most common load rated tire is only
a 195 width.  Especially for work use you will want at least a &quot;C&quot; load
rating.  I put passenger &quot;P&quot; load rated tires on my '71 Chevy truck from 8
plys and the &quot;P&quot; tires plain old suck, squishes all over when any weight is
in it!

The best I could find was a 215/75R14 Goodyear Marathon Radial from
TireRack_dot_com for $63 each.  Granted this is a highway rib which may not be
good for off road farming?   

Previous ramblings by me on the Vintage bus list which could be helpful.
Someone e-mailed me a warning on the Cooper tires lawsuit so be careful on
them:

If you are in the market for 14&quot; rims or a different choice for the 15&quot;
check out the Cooper tires. Thanks to Greg McKinney for putting me on the
Cooper trail.  These should priced pretty fairly.

and this for &quot;D&quot; load 14&quot;s in 185 and 195!!!
http://www.coopertires_dot_com/tire_cooper/ltsuv.asp?id=34
 
And here are the traditional recommendations:
-Yokohama Y360  http://www.yokohamatire_dot_ca/main/index.htm
-Bridgestone 603V available in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; load ranges for 14&quot; 185/195.  
-Kumho seems to have a bunch of possibilities in the 852 (only 14&quot; but &quot;D&quot;
load), 824 Venture HT (15&quot; only, &quot;C&quot; load), and 825 Venture AT (15&quot; only,
&quot;C&quot; load). http://www.kumhotireusa_dot_com/pages/lt_main.htm  I have been very
very pleased with a set of ECSTA Supra 712 tires, so I may have to look into
these options.
-Michelin http://tires.michelin-us_dot_com/  For the money they do not seem as
good as some lower cost options.  The max load weight seems low for what you
are paying for.


Good Luck,
