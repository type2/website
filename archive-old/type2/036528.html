Subject: Left Sitting

Hi,
I was wondering.. (as you do)... My kombi has been sitting in my drive for
the last 3 months (stuffed carby among other things).. I can't afford to get
it fixed til May, how bad is it to have it just sit there for that long?? Is
there anything I should be aware of? (Other than people moving into it and
those spider webs all over it...)

Thanks,
Cassandra.

Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky
and I thought to myself, &quot;Where the heck is the ceiling?&quot;
