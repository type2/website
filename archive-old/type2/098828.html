Subject: headliner vs. windshield dilemma

Hello List,

I am planning on replacing my head liner pretty soon.
All of the windows have been removed (because the
seals were rotten and there was some rust)and most of
the window sills have been repaired and in primer
waiting for a respray. The only one that is still left
in place is the winshield. I was very lucky with this
bus. There is absolutely no signs of rust under the
windshield and the windshield is not cracked. The seal
is soft and like new. It fits perfectly and I have
never had problems with it leaking. Do I have to take
it out to replace my headliner? Can I just apply the
correct glue under the edge of the seal and tuck the
edge of the headliner under the seal? After it dries,
will it pull out when the rest of the headliner is
installed? The windshield and seal are one of the few
things about this bus that is new condition and I
don't want to mess with a good thing if I don't have
to. I would hate to break the windshield and have to
buy a new one and seal just to install the
headliner...:0/ Any thoughts? Oh, If it comes to it,
and I have to buy a new seal, are the ones available
today of good quality? I would hate to have to worry
about leaks and having my perfect windshield sill
rust. I have been pulling my hair out everytime I
think about it. Any tips that I haven't found in the
archives??? Any help would be appreciated.

Have a great day! 
David Kelly
