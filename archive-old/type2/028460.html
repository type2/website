I suggest testing it out in boiling water.  If it's coming on at 212 degrees
it's gonna be on a lot and you'll never really know if you are overheating.
The VDO gauge setup is really the way to go.

Improve your cooling capacity. T-stat and flaps in place?  Cool tin or
standard &quot;forget me nots&quot; under the cylinders? No vacuum leaks...test with a
water bottle that has a 2 ft fuel hose on it and an old main jet in the end.
All the other basics in order?  Then if you are using decent oil (I like SAE
40 above 68 degrees), 240 is acceptable on the highway at 65.   55?  I think
you have something amiss unless it's real hot outside.  Remember, 10 small
air leaks around the shroud can equal one big one.  Triple check and *seal
all air leaks*.  Metal tape is great on the shrouds.  Might be worth
checking to make sure you have the correct fan as well.  I've seen many
shops put in the narrower one.

To your q's.

1. Possible but very unlikely.  It's fairly idiot proof with a stock oil
pump and can't open at the wrong time
2. The stock spring and &quot;grooved&quot; plunger always works best for me. Leave
the front bypass alone.

In my ongoing effort to see if I can get my 71 Westy to run cooler, last
night I removed and inspected the oil pressure relief valves.

This is a basically stock 1600DP, doghouse, dual relief case engine, with
about 40 to 50K miles since the last rebuild.  I recently installed a Berg
dipstick temperature switch, and found that the thing goes off whenever I
exceed 55 to 60 MPH. As soon as I drop below that speed, the light promptly
goes out.  There doesn't seem to be much relationship to ambient air
temperature.  I've got new manifold boots, new spark plug air seals, the
carb (Brosol 34 PICT 3) has about 30K miles since new, engine to body seal
is good, and all other cooling related items I can think of and easily
inspect are normal.

Both relief valve springs and plungers were whistle clean, and dropped out
easily when I removed the threaded plugs.
