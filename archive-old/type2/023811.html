After purchasing a 74 Westy this weekend, and after a long trip to
retrieve it, I am curious about a couple of things.
The rear end is sagging and the rear wheels are out at the bottoms a
bit.
It seems to me that if the rear end was brought to the correct level
that the wheels would come in----right? 

It is has an automatic transmission, and it operated just fine when I
took it for a test drive, in Sioux Falls South Dakota, however, the
closer I got to to home,
(Chicago) the sloppier the 2--3 shift became.
It is now slipping pretty bad, unless I get off the throttle, when it is
time for it to shift, or let it wind out in first and then slip my foot
off the pedal and then get back on it, and it will go right to third.
Is there a governor adjustment?
The trans fluid isn't burnt, and it is full of fluid.

And the only other thing I can see that may be causing me a problem is
the pop top has a 8&quot; to 10&quot; section, half way towards the rear of the
top, where the seal is suppose to touch the roof, is bowed out about an
inch, and the seal isn't touching.
How in the heck would a guy correct this, short of cutting the glass,
and relaminating it? 
  
The outside of the Van is almost spotless, and has no rust anywhere.
The interior appears as though no one has ever sat in it.
I runs well, as the van has only 32,000 on it.
Anyway, any help or suggestions would be appreciated, and I hope I
didn't cook the trans on the ride home. 

Thanks,

Terry
