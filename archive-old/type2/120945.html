Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable replacement frequency

??Since aquiring my 78 Westy at 65,000 mi, back in 1986 (based on the
retired couple I bought it from, it had not been changed), I remember 
replacing  it prophylactically in 1995 before a 10,000 mi trip when I
pulled the engine at 150,000 mi to check the clutch.....( which was
still 1 mm from the rivets but I changed it!  I am very gentle on
shifting/clutching.  THAT 2nd cable broke 
12 mi from home a  year ago when I had close to 235,000 mi-limped it
home shifting without the clutch-so it went about 85K-  hmm, quality
control must have gone down?  I think it broke in the bowden tube,
likely from friction in the bend.  I had a 71 bus that went 220mi, and
broke the cable once (very inconvenient in Syracuse) somewhere around
100K.... I'd say the life span is dependent on local vs highway miles-
The 78 became a daily driver after 1995 and so I'd say if locally used,
the cable should be replaced by 80K??

Which brings me to my question: Does anyone replace their cable as a
routine maintenance item rather than wait for it to break in an
inconvenient spot and time?  And, if so, what would you think the
average life would be?  This last cable of mine only made it a bit more
than a year (a hard year to be sure and about 18000 miles), whereas the
one before lasted about 5 years/60000 miles.  I'd be hard-pressed to
pick a reliable interval for preventative cable replacement.
