  Converts-now long Mexican bus story

&lt;&lt; There is a water cooled Mexican bus in VT sitting at John's Car Corner, a 
panel van. He has 2, an air-cooled 85 with a 1600 and a water-cooled 92 
with a 1.8L, both in pretty good condition. He got them from a lady from 
MA who had brought them up from Mexico and couldn't register them in MA 
(big surprise). John is planning on using them with his dealer plate. 
 &gt;&gt;

My guess is that they're gonna turn up a red flag at the Motor Vehicle Dept.
computer when/if he tries to register it. IIRC, a guy I knew bought an Alfa
Romeo in NJ that came from Canada. He thought it was a great deal, 'til
he took the title to MV and the little old lady behind the counter handed 
him back the title...&quot;No&quot; was about the gist of the conversation...
