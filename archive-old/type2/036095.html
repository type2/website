	NICE idea Mark. My Corrado came from the factory with a gizmo
that displays 
time (default)
oil temp, 
exterior temp, 
trip elapsed time (auto-reset after 2 hours turned off), 
trip elapsed miles
&amp; MPG

You tick through the selections using a button on the end of the
turn signal stalk. The trip elapsed time, miles and MPG have two
'banks', bank 1 being the one that resets to 0 after 2 hours of
being off, bank 2 in theory being cumulative but in practice it
seems to reset... probably now that I think about it, it resets
when the elapsed time wraps around 99:59 :) Since its a 4 digit
display.

	IF someone wants to build this kind of display for a bus (but not
using the existing radio displays) you'd start with an LCD pannel display 
with built-in Analog to Digital converter (Pretty commonly available) and 
add an analog mux.  A package of flip-flops  cascaded or a counter can drive 
the select lines on the mux, with a nice, dumb, heavily debounced pushbutton 
to tick through the selections.

	An equally valid solution, and by far cheaper, would be a nice big
surpus analog meter movement and a rotary switch to select between inputs.

	But neither is as elegant as display on the existing radio LCDs :)

	Wish I had time to fiddle with this stuff, its fun :)

	Bill
