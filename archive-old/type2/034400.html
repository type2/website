Hi Chris

I bought a broken bus earlier this year. The number 1
cylinder was shot (looked like the head hadn't been torqued
properly). Did a poor mans rebuild (found a used
P&amp;C, honed and rerung all four cylinders), put it back together
and headed for the Yomega YoYo competition in Rhode Island
my son had entered in.

The 73 engine has a weber DFEV conversion and the breather
hose was simply sticking up like yours. Being smart (or so I thought)
I connected the breather hose to the air cleaner when I repaired
the engine.

On the way to R.I. I started loosing/using oil like crazy !
Remembering that the P.O. had the breather hose sticking up,
I disconnected it from the air cleaner and continued with the
trip. I did not use/lose another drop of oil !

Once in R.I. I stopped at a local FLAPS and bought a length
of american heater hose and connected one end to the breather,
and routed the other end through the foam engine tin gasket pointing
to the ground (figured it was better to vent it outside of the vehicle).

That was 7,000 miles ago and the bus still runs fine,

Good Luck

&gt;When I bought my bus, the carb in it was not doing to well (Weber
&gt;progressive single carb conversion). I just installed a new Weber in it and
&gt;it runs great now. I think the problem was that the crankcase breather had
a
&gt;hose that connected to the underside of the AC assembly and there was a lot
&gt;of oil inside the air cleaner that I think ended up ruining the old carb. I
&gt;mean, there was more than just a film of oil inside the AC unit, in the
&gt;edges, it was all pooled up and the choke plate closest to the breather
tube
&gt;was almost all black. I had also replaced all the intake manifold seals and
&gt;the intake port on the cylinder that was closest to the breather tube was
&gt;also black inside but all the others were a nice bright metal color.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways, I don't want this to happen to my new carb so I didn't connect the
&gt;breather tube back up to the AC unit. I just left it hanging loose (pointed
&gt;up). I don't want it squirting oil all over my engine either, but I'm
afraid
&gt;to block off the tube because I don't want air pressure to build up in the
&gt;crankcase. What should I do with the tube?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
