&gt;         I know that some of you long term Bay Pilots, somewhere, have

Okay, okay.  :-)  I replaced the bushing myself a long time ago - it's a 
job I never want to do again.  The steering was oh-so-tight and wonderful 
for about... six months after which time I detected play in the bushing 
again.  It has remained somewhat loose ever since, although it is still way 
better than the old bushing ever was and doesn't seem to be getting much 
worse.  I'm not sure if I didn't install it right or what, but I was very 
disappointed at how fast it &quot;wore in&quot;.  If you got 41,000 miles out of 
yours, you did better than me.
