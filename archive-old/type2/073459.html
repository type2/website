&gt;Who makes your Freeze 12.  I'm trying to avoid
&gt;confusion with FrigC made by Intercool.

Says, &quot;Manufactured by TCC, Dallas, TX 75220 (800) 527-0885 (How about
that?  They have their phone number on the can!!)  Brand name is Johnsen's.

&gt;Freeze 12 claims you can go ahead and charge as a
&gt;vapor.  I'm wondering if they are just trying to over
&gt;simplify things here, because I thought all blends
&gt;g\had to be liquid charged.  Note that as long as you
&gt;fully use an integral number of cans like you did,
&gt;liquid or vapor charging shouldn't matter.

I don't really know the difference, but I've always pierced the can near
the bottom and it seems to work fine.

&gt;Do you
&gt;need to be certified to buy Freeze 12?

Yes.

&gt;Where do you
&gt;buy just a couple of cans?

Your local FLAPS should have it - if not, ask around.

&gt;I think you can buy a 12
&gt;can case on the internet for about $8/can not
&gt;including shipping.

Seems expensive.  Mine was only $6.89/can at the FLAPS

&gt;Also, what type of can fittings did you use?  I've
&gt;heard you can use the R12 can side tap fitting on
&gt;Freeze 12.

That's the one I use - side puncture.  Works great with R12, Freeze 12, and
I can even stretch it to fit around the 134a cans.  I have the old original
R12 fittings on both of my vehicles, and my gauges are the same.  I thought
it was stupid to have to go out and buy new gauges or a whole slew of
adapters to change refrigerant, so I didn't.  :)  I just can't let anyone
else work on my cars because they won't know what type of refrigerant is
inside the A/C system.  I don't need no steeeenking stickers!
