Subject: '69 Westy f/s NO RUST

My buddy in San Luis Obispo CA just called and informed me his wife said
&quot;out with the camper, In with the Cabriolet&quot;
Yuck!
Anyway, interior is very nice original, not a dot of rust, one dent on the
out side( I will fix it for free, if you want the bus)
Strong running, new brakes, nice WESTY POP-TOP
He wants $2995 b.o.
I will give you his phone #, I have to look it up right now, and I will
also try to find his email address.   His name is Louis, nicest guy in the
world, takes car of this baby.
