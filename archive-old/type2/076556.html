Subject: Re:  3.5 months in a bus (Fuel pump buzzing)

&gt;&gt;Is there any obvious reason why my bus would be
going through FI fuel pumps once a year?  I bought a
rebuilt last year to replace the previous one, and at
the 10,000 mile mark it started to make that funny
whirring noise that means imminent death is near.

Fuel pump whirring is usually cavitation due to a
clogged fuel filter, in my case due to a rusty tank. 
Went through a bazillion filters and almost paid $150+
for a fuel pump before I figured out the problem. 
Pulled the tank and replaced it with a new one. 
(Vanagon tanks still available from Bus Depot new!
Thanks Ron!!!)

Does your bus have a fuel filter between the tank and
the pump?  Apparently some vanagons didn't, as odd as
that sounds.  I'd add a filter upstream if it does
not.
