&gt; There is un-cleaned-up-casting at the bottom of the cylinder bores that
&gt; prevent the pistons froom withdrawing into the cases as I expected them to
&gt; do. Quite a chunk of casting, not just something that could be knocked off
&gt; with a file.

No, please don't do this.

&gt; I'm going to quit on it for now and wait until I have someone to help me so
&gt; that I can stand the cases up on one side and try to fit the other case half
&gt; to the bottom one. Doing it alone, I can't figure out what's keeping them
&gt; from rotating into correct alignment.

I repeat, there is a single stud in the center bottom of the case that
supports the oil pick-up tube, it must be aligned, and you cannot
see it from where you are now. Just do it. Get a helper.

&gt; Really, I just wanted to say how important it is to mention to newbies that
&gt; they should remove the pistons *before* splitting the cases (at least for a
&gt; 1.7L)

Note to &quot;Newbies&quot; -  Please remove the pistons before you attempt to split the
case.
( at least for a 1.7L  8^).
