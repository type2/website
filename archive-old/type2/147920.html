Subject: Re: Wiring ledes from Battery

Anton,

While you're looking at the wiring it's not a bad idea to replace your 
fuses if you don't know how old they are. I fixed one problem (fuse wire 
was cracked but not disconnected) and headed off another (fuse 
disintegrated when removed) by this process. You may also find incorrectly 
rated fuses have been used. And if you're still keen, clean any earth 
connections that you can find and check that you've got the earth strap 
from the gearbox to the body!

Cheers,

Martin.

 &gt;About a month ago I had a problem with starting Konrad the Tiki Bus.
 &gt;Turned out that cleaning the leads going to the battery terminals was
 &gt;all it took.

 &gt;I examined the leads again today, and the wiring looks pretty bad. I am
 &gt;thinking R/R.
