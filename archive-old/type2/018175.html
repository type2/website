&gt; Or better yet, avoid campgrounds altogether.  Perhaps not as possible in the
&gt; east, but out here in the wild, wild west there are usually plenty of places
&gt; to pull off the side of the road or head down a back road on gov't land,
&gt; pull over, and have the place to yourself.

Good idea, but be careful.  Don't tkink about it in Nat'l Park Service
(NPS) land.    Forest Service or BLM land are better choices, but I
think the regulation for FS land is that if you're camping you have to
be a mile off the road.  Don't know about BLM.  Probably similar.  The
law probably won't be enforced in the wild remote areas, BUT...
certainly in the more commonly patrolled areas, and if you encounter an
unforgiving officer, and if there is a campground nearby, you'll be
asked to pack it up and perhaps even get fined.  

But then, that's only if you get caught...

Of course, one big danger of choosing your own spot in this manner is
the fact that you're isolated.   Not that there are many hoodlums
running around in the woods, but if a few drunk teens (or adults for
that matter) with a gun or two happened upon a lone bus on a Friday or
Saturday night... especially if they thought they had something against
&quot;bus driving hippies&quot;... you never know.  We live in wild times.
