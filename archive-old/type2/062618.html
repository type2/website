Anyone have experience with this?  Didn't someone just run Inviuk with a =
PC riding shotgun?  I would like to run my laptop off a power inverter =
(street price roughly $40+) rather than shell out $120 for the fancy =
Toshiba power cord for my laptop......and yet I don't relish the idea of =
a cooked notebook, either......

Subject:        Running my computer off an auxiliary battery


        I just installed an auxiliary battery isolated from the main
battery in my '71 Westy.  I have also connected a DC to AC power =
inverter
to the auxiliary battery. The inverter is capable of putting out 400 =
watts
continuously. That is at least twice the power I need to run my computer
and monitor.=20
        My question is: Is it safe (for my computer) to run my computer
while the engine is running? If so, is it safe to start or stop the =
engine
while running my computer?
        Thanks in advance.
