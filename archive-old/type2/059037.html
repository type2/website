Subject: RE: Fuel injected 1600

&gt;Interestingly Todd Francis had posted a note in early July about a guy
&gt;in Oregon who has an interesting FI setup that he sells. He uses Bosch
&gt;parts from Rabbits for his system. If I remember right it is based on
&gt;CIS. If you are interested he has a site at  http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com.


Hmm, that is interesting.  Rabbits used Bosch K-Jetronic, which is a 
continuous injection system, rather than a pulsed system like L-Jet or 
D-Jet.  So basically in K-Jet, instead of the injectors being solenoid 
valves that open and close to inject fuel, the injectors merely serve to 
atomize the fuel, which is flowing through them all the time.

I'll check out that page.
