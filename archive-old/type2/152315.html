Subject: Re: [T2] about load range D vs C reinforced tires

had a flat and was over my tire store (NTB) and they had a new michelin
truck tire that had our sizes for the bus in the correct load range, at
the moment I can't remember the name but it was a Michelin not an Agelis
(I have Agelis 81 on my bus and they are good tires, but I liked the MXT's
better)  this tire is an all season radial.

&gt; Trying to check for tires on daughter's 75 which is 800 mi from me-
&gt; she'd have to find a tire in Savannah area.
