Subject: 2 dead cylinders on 1600 DP

Hey Y'all,
Finally got around to installing the old 1600 DP in my
67 project bus.  Turns out that I have 2 dead
cylinders on the engine. I am getting no compression,
as in nada, zero, nothin on #3 &amp; #4.
Ok, this is obviously a head problem on that side,
right?
Would you all suggest that I replace just the head
just on that side, or is it better to install 2
matching heads?  BTW, anybody got 2 good heads??

Peace, John Baker
