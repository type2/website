Subject: 6 cyl Porsche in 1980 Westy?

Here's a question for the more mechanically adept of the type2 listers.
We've got a 1980 Westy with an engine that was seriously doctored to sell
it, and now we've got to decide what to do.  Does anyone have an opinion on
the feasibility of putting a 6 cylinder Porsche engine in this baby?  We've
got a line on one and even an offer of help from a motorhead, but I'd like a
second opinion before we embark on this adventure.  The existing engine is
in need of so much that buying a replacement anything is probably the best
bet.  We're not currently subscribers to this list, but I lurk like crazy on
here and have gotten tons of good info here.  Reply to our email address or
to the list and I will see the responses there when we get back to town.
Thanks to all who are interested in helping a newbie.  I'll subscribe when I
can devote more time to my email inbox (soon I hope).
