Subject: Re: [T2] 2L in a 71?

&gt; I'll be rebuilding or replacing the motor in my '71 Westy this summer. After
&gt; thinking about this for some time, a friend suggested I go with a 2L, fuel
&gt; injected motor. I'm looking for more torque and HP, and drive lots of
&gt; freeway miles and want to tow a motorcycle next year.
&gt;
&gt; Will a 2L FI motor fit/work in my Westy?

Pete, A type 4 (T4 on this list)  2L FI motor from a '76-79 bus will *NOT*
fit in your bus without major work on your part.  There was a large
change in the shape of the engine compartment cutout between the '71 and
'72 model years.  A type 1 engine can certainly be blown out to 2L and
aftermarket or late model beetle FI can certainly be installed or a type4
motor can be adapted to an upright fan with an aftermarket shroud, but....

&gt; Am I looking for more trouble than its worth?

YES!!!  (IMNSHO :-)  If you want a 2L T4 powered bus, I think you would
save money and grief in the long run by buying a 1976-78 bus with that
sytem originally installed.  Or at least, look for a '72-75 into which it
will fit with minir mods.

&gt; I'm not one to worry about keeping things original, but I will keep my
&gt; stocker for rebuild to original specs. Its a good motor with 169k miles, but
&gt; getting a wee bit tired.

At 169K, it is not tired..... it is a miracle! :-)  If you want to keep
costs down and the engione compartment somewhat original, you will be
limited to a type1 block.  You can build them out to a fair size, but
every step up in size is a step up in heat production and a step down in
longevity.
