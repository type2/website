Subject: shifter adjustment
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

A while ago I had to replace the shift linkage coupler in
my 74. Being an idiot I had already pulled and inspected
the shifter before figuring out that it was the coupler.
  Now the after market coupler is kinda marginal quality
compared to the original... but it seems to work. Got
everything back together and &quot;adjusted the shifter plate
at the base of the shifter... Now I can find all the gears
an all that but it seems to shift harder than with the
original linkage and postioning of the plate.

Question: How touchy is the adjustment for that plate?

  Also anyone who has to replace this part.. I would advise
drilling a hole in the square head of the &quot;set screw&quot; that
keeps everything aligned on the tranny shift-shaft so you
can put a lock wire on it... this after market one tends to
want to slowly work out.

   Thanks a bunch!
