&gt; Hmm. I bought my rebuilt engine from AVP. 1,500 miles after installation

&gt; If the engine is overheated, the center of the disk melts. This shows
&gt; weather the engine has been mistreated or not.

Wonder what that disk is made of. This might be a good thing for general
use. I wouldn't mind having something that would melt at, say 230 degrees
so I don't have to fight the dipstick or use a long meat thermometer.
...of course, a temperature gauge would keep me from even having to trek
to the back of the bus. 8) Joe
