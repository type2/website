Subject: Hypothetical situation with my hydrolic lifters...
Message-ID: &lt;171d84fd.24a07706_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

  O.K., I've kinda got a hypothetical question that seems too likely to 
become real. 
First, i have a 79 2000 FI type 4 engine in my bus which has hydrolic valves. 
In the past, i have started it up and heard a valve tap. this will sometimes 
go away within thirty seconds, or stay for a few miles. There seems to be no 
logical pattern to when it may happen. I can tell by listening that it's on 
the driver  side and most likely the back cylinder under the oil cooler. I 
put new heads, rings, gaskets, and odds and ends on about 12,000 miles ago, 
but did nothing with the crankcase.
  I'm figuring that its a lifter that is getting stuck. Lets suppose that 
this is true. I'm gonna be goin on a cross country excursion in two weeks, 
and would rather install new lifters somewhere in Wyoming when i can at least 
admire the view then delay my departure.(assuming that this does come to 
that) 
  O.K., now i'm drivin down highway 666 or somethin and the valve starts 
chattering away. It doesnt do its passive thing and tighten up when it 
decides its time. 
  If i were to go in and adjust the valve as if it were a solid lifter, 
should this act as a good temperary fix? If so, when the lifter finally 
decides that it's gonna adjust it's self, will it adjust to the setting that 
i put the valve at, or will it expand and overtighten the valve?
Any insights are greatly appreciated on this one, and i hope i'm not 
searching the desert to get information when i need it.
