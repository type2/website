Subject: nose panel???

https://secured.webappcabaret_dot_com/busdepot/images/parts/9556200.jpg

The replacement nose panels I have seen around seem to have a little raised 
area where the emblem is mounted. Anyone know if this take the standard 7 
inch emblem, or do they take some wierd smaller version like the Brazillian 
models had?

I called busdepot, but the guy at the counter wasnt aware of the raised 
area, but assured me ppl have bought them in the past and nobody has ever 
mentioned needing a different sized emblem to go on the front.

I just want to make sure.

Also, only the chrome ones are available now, can I just have the body shop 
blast that and paint it white like the original?
