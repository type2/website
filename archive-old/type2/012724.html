It finally happened.  Headed to a show, 50 miles out, the tired 1800 in
my 74 westy let go. Oil, smoke noise, the whole deal.

Now I am looking at options.  been trying to find a good engine in Texas
with no luck. Am considering a possible Type 1 engine conversion, I would
like to hear from anyone with experience here to help me out, or talk me
out of it.

I would not mind putting a Type IV back in but have not been able to find
one in Texas and dont have the cash for a new long block.

If anyone knows of one I have a 72 hardtop Westy with a non running 1700
with dual carbs to swap, along with my blown 1800.  Not much of a deal
but it is a place to start.

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
Abilene, Texas
