Subject: Re: [T2] Turnkey, Fuel Injected, New Mexican VW engines...

I am told by my Mexican roommate that a brand new Mexican air-cooled beetle
costs around $4000 U.S. in Mexico.( a lot cheaper than the 13,000 those
importers ask for the new ones on old pans!) it seems logical that buying a
powerplant there for one would have to be less than the $1200 companies
charge here just for the long block. i would bet that a case would cost
around 100-150 bucks there especially since places like JC whitney sell them
for about 300, typical markup is 100% so 150 seems responsible. i have driven
a new beetle and i was amazed by the performance of that engine. its also
equipped with a catalytic converter so i'd feel less bad about driving a
stink pot., modern fuel injection, electronic ignition, hydraulic lifters,
spin on oil filter, makes my mouth water.  THese engines supposedly meet us
smog requirements, safety issues are all that hold the beetles over the
border.
