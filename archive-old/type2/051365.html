FWIW.....

COSTCO is now carrying a very nice flatbed trailer.  Couldn't locate a spec
sheet on the one I eyeballed the other day, but it's a bit larger than the
lightweight folding trailers that places like Schuck's and Harbor Freight
sell.  Looks to be very well screwed together, with built in tiedown points
in the deck.

&gt;&gt;  I'm torn - between 2 trailers.  Size (40&quot;x48&quot;) and price ($225) the
same, as Harbor charges no freight.  The dilemna is weight, tire size,
and color...  &lt;&lt;
