Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch lever/lock

Hey Patrick,

Sorry for your woes...unfortunately unlike a Ford truck there are times when 
you can't get things for your bus locally. Ocassionally you will have to 
order online, unless you are  right down the road from a good supplier that 
accomodates the VW Bus. I have found that an online experience usually has a 
lot to do with who you buy from. I have had a lot of good experiences with 
www.gowesty_dot_com and would reccomend them. I wouldn't reccomend a few places, 
but won't mention them.

What year is your bus? It might help others to determine if they can use the 
hatch lid lock you ordered. I believe the engine lid and hatch lock are the 
same on the later buses...in fact it has been a while since I owned an early 
baywindow bus, but I was thinking that the mechanism was pretty similar. 
Have you tried to install the lock you received?

Good luck, and next time order from gowesty if possible, and confirm on the 
phone what you are ordering, it helps to eliminate mistakes by the consumer 
and the supplier.
