Subject: RE: [WetWesties] Adhesive recommendation

Chuck,

This one I can help you with--easy

I saw on public TV a guy who could get any stain out of anything---(  I
never saw him get super glue out of anything )
anyway I did see him get a crayon stain out of an item.

Lay an old t-shirt over the stain, and wave the hot iron over the
shirt--it will lift and transfer the crayon spot right out of the
material in question  into the t-shirt.

Give that a shot---

Have fun---

Terry

I've got what appears to be a melted crayon on my bench seat - any
suggestions on how to remove that? Maybe the freeze spray?

[WetWesties] Adhesive recommendation
Hey All---
Before I say one more word, I would like to thank everyone that came to
my call for chemical assitance last evening and this morning--I was
totaly inspired by all of your goodness, and helpful hints /
suggestions--
Now to reality--
If anyone EVER want to be sticking something together--I highly
recommend Loctite, Quicktite.
The reason?
This stuff will not come out of my rear seat cushion--not yet anyway.
BUT--I am bound and determined.
Here is the removal result line up.
Freezing it out and having it chip off using a $7.00 can of circuit
board freeze spray.
It laughed at that-- it didn't even think about moving one iota.
So it's off to the store and load up with finger nail polish---first I
massaged it with Q-tips--gently--and after 20 Q-tips and a half a bottle
of nail polish and 1 hour--I needed to get more aggressive I figured. So
into the house I go and get a old tooth brush--more nail
polish---NUPE--no movement yet.--another hour of mini scrubbing.
Oops--it's 5:45 pm--Ace is the place closes in 15 minutes--and off I
go--
Now I have a squeeze bottle of Duro super glue remover--this must be
it---
&quot; squeeze on and let sit for 2 minutes and reapply if needed&quot;--the
reapplication process took me 2 hours--
I used the tooth brush--then I used the remover--then hitting it with a
wash of nail polish remover with the brush---then hitting it with Zep
formula 50 to try and break the bond somehow.
The results----???
Nothing--Zip, Nada, Kaput, Finito, Arriva Derchi, No Go Joe.
Tomorrow---back to Ace is the place and I did see a quart of &quot;extra
strength Acetone&quot;
&quot;Thins fiberglass resin&quot;---
This may be the answer--I'll see.
No damage so far to the seat--yet---
In closing, allow me to recommend this Loctite Quicktite super glue
product---the stuff so far is bullet proof--and Terrence proof--:&gt;)
More tomorrow--
Later,
                 ______________
