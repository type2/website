&gt;I hate to add, but does anyone have opinions on if troy should also
&gt;get a throwout bearing?

YES I have an opinion on this!  If his old throwout bearing works well, 
leave it in there unless he can find a brand new factory-original throwout 
bearing.  I have had bad experiences (yes, plural) with new replacement 
throwout bearings of questionable origin and IMO you are just as likely if 
not more likely to have to pull the engine again if you replace your good, 
working throwout bearing with an unknown-quantity new one.  If the bearings 
roll smoothly and it doesn't make noise, leave it there!

My 2 cents.
