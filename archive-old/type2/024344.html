Message-ID: &lt;7kt7m4$t17d_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Anyone know if I can change this flange(71 Bus) without pulling the sterring wheel off  to lift up the column tube? It looks to me as if I can get at it from the inside of the bus( 4 bolts)

I've changed the rubber donut without pulling the steering column from underneath. Real pain in the butt. You need two 13mm box wrenches. I recommend dropping the steering box (which is also a pain in the butt getting the steering arm off and cutting the donut up to seperate the steering shaft from the steering box) to make life easier, but I did it with the steering box in place. Not fun.
