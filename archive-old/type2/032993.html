To all that have responded or read this PLF subject,

I ordered and PAID for a pop-top from Dawn the beginning of September.  I 
still to this day have yet to receive it even though my check was cashed 
within two days of receipt.  She promised me that I would have the top in 
time for my trip the beginning of October in my now fully restored '71 Westy. 
 My trip date came and went with no pop-top.  I'm sorry but it gets too cold 
in Colorado to go without it.  I too have moved many times and went through 
the anguish of a divorce but knowing what side the bread is buttered on I 
always maintained contact with my clients even when I was delinquent.  This 
lack of communication on her part is unacceptable in the business community 
especially with a pre-paid product.
I realize that she is a nice person and delivers a quality product.  That is 
why I haven't cancelled my order to date but as of today I still have no 
product and a couple of days ago she informed me she was leaving on vacation 
for a week.  Sorry but I remember many missed holidays, including this one, 
due to business obligations that I had.

Of course this is just my opinion... I could be wrong.
