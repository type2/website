Subject: BugPack Full Flow oil return/pressure issues

Hi All,

I have recently purchased a '68 VW Riviera Camper with a rebuilt dual
relief case 1905cc engine w/ 700 miles on it.  It has an aux. oil cooler
and spin-on oil filter added.  I an running 15w40 oil in it currently.
The oil light is coming on sometimes when the engine oil is good and
warm and I am sitting at idle.  Idling around 1000rpm(according to
Bendix Tach).  When I blip the throttle, light goes away.

The engine is setup with an oil pump cover with a connection to divert
the oil to the cooler, then filter, then return to the engine thru the
oil pressure relief valve using an oil return adapter from BugPack, item
#3059.  So there is no oil pressure relief valve plunger

Any one else using this oil return adapter?

I have replaced the oil pressure sending switch, no better.

Should I refrain from driving until this issue is figured out (even to a
garage?)  As long as the oil light is not illuminated am I ok to drive?
The light routinely goes out as soon as I come off idle.

I would like to check oil pressure at the oil pressure sender, but I am
having trouble sourcing a test gauge that will allow me to T in a gauge
and the sender. Metric pipe threads right? Can any one recommend a place
to find such a test gauge?

Thanks for reading...

-Greg
