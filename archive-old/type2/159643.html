&gt; I was thinking one of these because they're rated waterproof:

Interesting.  That one looks like kinda like the Attwood blower.  It's 
about $4 more, though.  I'll probably go for the waterproof Attwood 
Turbo 3000 if they have it in.  I was looking for the non-waterproof one 
at Home Depot because it's cheaper, but they didn't have it at the store 
and I'll probably waste the same amount of money trying to find the 
cheaper one. ;)

That's pretty neat.  I was thinking of installing the input duct on the 
flat spot, though, just behind the cabinetry.  I was then thinking of 
putting a short riser tube or something like that (if needed).  I guess 
I could also try and put something in the wall, but I don't really mind 
the riser, either.  From there, I was just going to split the feed to 
the two fans and then send the output into the stock hoses.  I'll have 
to see if they have a 3&quot;-to-2.25&quot; adapter or something close.  Since the 
stock hoses are 2.25&quot; and the input's 3&quot;, I don't think it'll have a 
problem sucking enough air from one source because there's a restriction 
on the output anyways.

I'll stop over there tomorrow and take a look at the stuff if they're 
open.  I really wanna get this set up in the next few days.
