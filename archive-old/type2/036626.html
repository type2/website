Subject: Beard with Respirator/DeltaCoat/airless paint sprayer

I use a respirator occasionally and have a beard, you will smell *some*
fumes, as opposed to not smelling any fumes at all, but unless you decide to
paint for a living, you won't inhale enough dangerous stuff to harm you.
Most solids that do make it past the unsealed mask will be filtered by your
beard.

Any of you guys considering the Delta Coat stuff, be aware that he is not
talking about a regular airless paint sprayer.  He's talking about
specialized equipment designed to spray heavy coatings.  Unless you live
in/near major metropolitian area, you likely won't find one for rent, or
sale for that matter.  Check commercial paint stores, usually
Sherwin-Williams will have a store primarily for commercial/industrial
painters in most larger cities.  Glidden usually does, too.  They will
likely have one for rent.  You may want to find out exact specs for sprayer
before you order product, to make sure you will be able to find a spray rig
big enough to spray it, some products require an air assissted airless
sprayer.  It's a real pain to purchase some pretty expensive specialized
coating, just to find out you have to buy a $4000-6000.00 piece of equipment
just to spray it.  (I used to be a manager of a Sherwin-Williams and this
HAS happened)

Can't remember off top of my head minimum gpm for this type rig, but it will
have a 3/8&quot; hose as opposed to 1/4.  If you know someone that coats roofs,
or paints bridges, they probably will own one.

Last note:  20 mils is about 5-6 times as thick as when you are painting a
wall.  Pretty easy to attain since you will be painting on a horizontal
surface.

&gt;However, our product requires a heavy duty
&gt; industrial sprayer for application. If you are familar with airless spray
&gt; systems, a gas powered sprayer can be rented at large rental centers for
&gt; around $100 per day.
