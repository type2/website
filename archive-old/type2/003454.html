        Does anyone know if Buses were ever delivered with no 4 ways? My
friends 71 doesn't even have a switch for them. No original hole in the dash
where the switch would go either.
Also there are no back-up lights. The signals are where the back-up lights
should be (mounted horizontally above the tail lights). The tail lights look
stock.(brake lights and driving lights). Seems strange to me. Are there
anymore buses out there like this?

Thanks
