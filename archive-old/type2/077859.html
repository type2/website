Subject: '78 bus

HelloSorry about the first mail. That was an accident. I am a 20 yr old guy who just got his first bus a few months ago. a few weeks ago driving home from work. it just cut off and wouldn't start or turn over. so i had to have it towed to the local VW shop. the guy took a wrench and tried turning the alternator i believe or something connected to the motor that he said he should be able to turn by hand. so i had to get the motor replaced. now i can't get my van to accelerate right. everytime i go back they adjust the choke. the problem i'm having is when i step on the pedal, if i don't step very slowly it will cut off, especially when cold. if it is warmed up it is a lil better but still just kinda pauses for a good while before it gets up and gets going. this isn't good when i'm pulling out and it is cutting off on me in the middle of intersections. i'm scared to drive the thing. i know when it is cold it affects the van, but prior to my motor locking up. i could just jump in and hit the gas and go no matter wha
t. we had ice here and it still was never this bad. also i found out when the motor was replaced, that my van has a ford carb on it. any suggestions? should i have the carb replaced. try setting the choke back to the way it was prior to the new motor? sorry for the long message. any suggestions or insights would be much appreciated.
