Subject: Beetlemex engine first start Q

Hey y'all
Been busy with life, camping, and tournament season but I 
have a question.  Those of you who bought new engines, 
what did you do to them before the first start? 
 Specifically, did you prime the oil system, retorque 
everything etc.

Thanks!

Mad Uncle Dave
