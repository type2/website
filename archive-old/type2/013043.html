Subject: AVP Head Problem-Major
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

hey volks,
glad to hear that everybus was another huge success, i
will definitely be there next year!  i too had a great
weekend camping, unfortunately just not in my bus.  a
friend and i were heading out to camp for the weekend
and catch a couple shows and were about 30 miles into
the trip when my bus suddenly started to lose power. 
i quickly lose about 10 mph so i shut her down and
pull over.  go to turn the key and she wont budge. 
long story short, had her towed, yanked the engine
last night and i found that my #4 exhaust valve had
snapped mangling my other valve, destroying my piston
and sending bits of stuff all through my engine, not a
pretty site('74 1800 engine).  i am really bummed
seeing this was a replacement AVP head with less than
7000 miles on it.  it has not been overheated at all
and i was doing around 60 mph when it snapped,
dipstick was so cool that i could grab the end with
the oil on it without pain.  add to that the fact that
the entire lower end of my motor was gone through and
redone less than 2000 miles ago and i am out a major
amount of cash and not sure what to do.  my mechanic
just couldnt believe that a valve snapped on a rebuilt
head either.  so it looks like i am back to the
drawing board but this problem kinda scared me, i dont
have a lot of alternatives as to replacement heads and
i am really poor right now so AVP is one of my only
practical choices.  what a pain!
