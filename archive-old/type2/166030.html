Hello James, are you on the swedishbricks list?  There's your best 
source for info, very similar in character to this list.

I was a 122 guy before switching to the Van and a Porsche 944.

Search and you shall find:

For injectors go with cruizinperformance_dot_com, popular on this list and 
from personal experience.  They replace broken pintle caps too, which is 
the little 'hat' you referred to.

Here are some vendors I used to use:

VLV World_dot_com
Online parts catalog for repair, maintenance, and restoration of all volvos

     * Swedish Engineering
       For Volvo parts and accessories.
       www.swedishengineering_dot_com

     * Swedish Classics
       New restoration and repair parts for vintage Volvo cars.
       www.swedishclassics_dot_com

     * RPR Company Inc.
       Sale of discount Volvo automobile parts and accessories.
       www.rprusa_dot_com

     * Chapman Motors (Vancouver Island)
       Sells and services new and used vehicles. Also specializes in 
used Volvo parts, with international shipping.
