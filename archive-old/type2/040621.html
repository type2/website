Subject: Results of block sealing + clutch repair

Well, he's back in my driveway! $428 later, which I thought was reasonable
considering I was paying for labour costs.
I gave the mechanic the list of things to check re the clutch, all of which
were done.
He replaced the clutch plate, clutch cable had also stretched, adjusted
everything and whaddaya know, I have a fully operational clutch and the
gears change like a dreammmmmmm..
Turned out that the fuel line was perished too - which explained the stinky
petrol smell I was looking for.
Main seal was replaced.
He used Devcon to seal the crack in the engine block. So far there are three
little drips on the drive way. (That was after a long drive home).. Guess
I'll just have to wait and see with that one. The engine block is not a
three point mount, it's got an adaptor fitted to fit the cross member. I get
the feeling that the PO fancied himself as a handyman and used bits and
pieces from whatever he had lying around to build the engine.
Nothing wrong with the oil cooler so there was no need to change it over.
Degreased the engine, replaced the seal where the battery fell over and the
acid ate it. Adjusted the timing and finally got the idle to work. Not a
single backfire or ping to be heard....
So, all in all, I think I've found myself a mechanic I can trust.
The engine looks neat, tidy and clean. In the four other times I've had
mechanics do work on it, it's never come back looking this good.
So, there you go.... I'm back on the road and as soon as I finish this
assignment I'll be installing my purple fur!
Thank you to everyone (again) for your help and advice, as always its
invaluable!
Cassandra.
