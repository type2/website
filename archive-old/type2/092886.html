Subject: Re: [T2] Head swapping question

The F.I. 2 liter engine has smaller valves to minimize (I think) the intake 
pulses that would confuse the AFM. They also came with mild cams to help 
the same problem.

The only other problem I see is that the 2L heads are going to have a 
larger hole for the top of the clyinder than you need and I do not know if 
this will cause sealing problems or not.


&gt;I appreciate everyone's patience with me while I try to
&gt;figure this out.
&gt;
&gt;I'm still working on getting replacement heads for my '74 westy 1800.
&gt;Today I found a local rebuilder who has some nice 2l heads that I can
&gt;get for a good price. These are rebuilt, and has new seats, valve guides,
&gt;and all new valves. The 2l will bolt right on to my 1800. The main difference
&gt;is that the intake valves are smaller. I understand that this is because
&gt;the fuel injection system works better with the smaller intake valves.
&gt;
&gt;I'm going to be running carburettors for a while yet, and wonder if there's
&gt;a serious drawback to using the 2l heads with carbs for a while.
&gt;
&gt;If not, I think I'll get these, which should last me a while until I can
&gt;afford to build the new engine.

Ciao!
