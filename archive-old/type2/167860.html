Subject: Re: [T2] Recall on LT Tires

With all of the latest reports of products from china INTENTIONALLY
containing poisons, lead paint, etc. etc. I have begun to check the &quot;Made
In&quot; labels more closely. Before it didn't atter much, but now if it goes in
my mouth or my life/safety/reputaton depends on it, it doesn't come from
china.

&gt;    FTS will probably disappear...The Chinese factory will sell tires thru'
&gt; an-
&gt; other broker with new names and just maybe they'll add the adhesive strips
&gt; (at least for a while) and the consumers will either replace their own
&gt; tires
&gt; or
&gt; wait for the next blowout... ;-(


One might conclude that thtey're trying to kill us off...
