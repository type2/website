&gt; Real good.  This is a common tire circumference.  Look on the box, but definitely test them before you hit the snow.

&gt; &gt;&gt; chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
&gt; &gt;&gt; And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
&gt; &gt;&gt; unshiney orig paint on my kombi?
&gt;
&gt; Never seen it happen.  And folks around here run them all the time.
The key is to ensure that you have all the slack taken up, with a bungie
cord type device (preferably the special made deal that comes with the
chain sets.)  YOU CAN THROW A CHAIN IF YOU LEAVE TOO MUCH SLACK, DRIVE
TOO FAST, OR DRIVE ON DRY ROAD.  Don't do any of these.  Take them off as
soon as you can.

I'll second that.  Another cause of fender flogging is trying to get too
much wear out of the chains.  Every time you remove them you should check
all the links for cracks and replace any cross-chains that are cracked.
Buy a few cross-chains for spares, and the chain pliars to put them in
place.  Always keep your chains in the snow, even if it means driving in
the snow with a dry lane next to you.  The CHP sometimes makes this
difficult by putting chain controls miles before the snow.

I put two rubber bungee gadgets on each chain.  That way if one breaks the
other will still be there

&gt; &gt;I say driveway becuase this is the first plsce you should try them.  Don't
&gt; &gt;leave it to when you are trying to mount them in a blizzard with wet slush
&gt; &gt;tricking down your arms and onto your pants!
&gt;
&gt; Ditto in a big way.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;If you really want to do it right, get an extra spare tire and carry the
&gt; &gt;chains already mounted on the spares.  It's a lot easier to swap wheels
&gt; &gt;than it is to put chains on.
&gt;
&gt; Don't agree.  It's easy to put them on, assuming you are not stuck
already.  Drape them over the rear tires, then pull forward a bit.  That
reach to the back lever-thingie is rough, but certainly not harder than
changing a tire.

I guess it depends upon how well equipped you are to change tires.  If you
have a good jack and a healthy cross-wrench it can be done in about a
minute per side.  I don't think I can put a chain on, adjust it, wire the
extra links back, and put on the stretechers that fast even in my
driveway, let alone on the hill.  I hate to do detail work like adjusting
chains when I'm freezing and the lug nuts are usually warm and dry!

&gt; &gt;Many folks prefer cable chains to &quot;real&quot; chains.  They run a lot smoother
&gt; &gt;but don't bite quite as well.
&gt;
&gt; Never tried them.  If you use chains properly and only when necessary,
I'm not sure what advantage these would have.

They are more tolerant of driving on dry pavement, which you sometimes
have to do in states like California.  They also don't thrash your
wheelwells as badly if a cross-link breaks.
