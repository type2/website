Subject: Re: [T2] H2O injection

Phil got off to a good start:
&gt;http://www.kuratrading_dot_com/PDF/WaterInj.pdf

	Right on, check, and this would be correct.


&gt;  I have
&gt;been using water injection for over two years on my 80
&gt;Westy, it helps to keep the head temp's low enough to
&gt;run at highway speeds (60-65).  I use a 2.5 gallon water
&gt;tank with a fish tank aerator as a filter, have a 12V
&gt;cut off valve between the tank and the intake
&gt;manifold, power on valve open/power off valve
&gt;closed,without this the water would siphon into the
&gt;engine.

	These precautions haven't been needed on any motor I've 
worked on.  Are you sure there's syphoning when you switch off, 
absent those solenoids?


&gt;   I have a #22 needle going into the vacuum for
&gt;the distributor as close as I can get it to the inlet.
&gt;At idle there is no water injected, when the throttle
&gt;is opened the flow starts with the vacuum, the volume
&gt;is controlled by the size of the needle.

	I don't envy you your FI as opposed to carb, but I do envy 
your suction!  On my Brazilian Weber the vac nozzle for the dizzie 
has what we call in the Brit Empah 'bugger all' suction  -  I sure 
can't understand how it governs both retard and advance  -  anyhow it 
doesn't suck water even thru a big needle.
	I'm therefore resorting to the intake horn just below the 
carb, where there's a handy nozzle blanked-off in my motor; works OK 
but needs a v small needle, say 0.54 mm or I have to fill the water 
bottle too often.  Mark Dearing's idea of using that nozzle but 
presenting it with water-saturated air sucked thru a sparger is also 
worth trying.



&gt;   I have not
&gt;advanced the timing but I might try it, to see what
&gt;happens with the temp.

	My main R&amp;D motor, the mighty Renault 1108cc, with CR 8.5:1 
and a better shape of combustion chamber than VW's, is normally 40 
BTDC but when I slapped on an extra 200 or even 300 of advance it 
still wouldn't knock on low-octane petrol, and gave yet further 
improvement in economy.  The only drawback was that in starting when 
the battery was a bit low, the spark going off so early would tend to 
turn the motor backwards.
	I do hope more Volksfolk will try WI as I'm sure it has much 
to offer in engine longevity, fuel economy, cleaner exhaust gases, 
and power.
