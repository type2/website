Subject: Clutch ... it would seem.

the pedal is pulling the cable, the cable is pulling
the lever at the tranny ... but its not disengaging the clutch
mechanism.


You have most likely a broken clutch fork, or what ever the real technical
term is. There are 2 ears inside the bell  housing that push the t-o
bearing into the pressure plate to disengage the clutch. If one or both of
those ears break you will have the problem you mention. Happened to me when
I drove my 72 cross county. To many hills in CA :-)... PITA pulling the
motor in the driveway that was slanted sideways at about 15 degrees... Not
a bad job though once you get the engine out.
