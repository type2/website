Subject: Sound Deadening Info and Heater Blower Hoses

Been scratching my head about a couple of things that solved themselves 
this weekend and I want you to know what I know.

Background: I am SLOWLY resurrecting my '78 Westy. In the process of 
replacing the rubber, I repainted it, am adding a Corvair 110, and 
generally updating the van with additional noise insulation, interior 
lighting, aux blowers for the heater (dual bilge blowers).

I'm not cheap - but I don't want to pay somebody's 150% profit ratio. There 
are alot of commercially available items that are identical to the ones 
that the flashy aftermarket catalogs sell at a fraction of the catalog 
price. In short it's times like this that you've found the catalog 
supplier's source.

The latest thing was adding the sound proofing to our Westy. My first layer 
is an asphalt material to the interior that is much like the poor man's 
Dynamat. Works very, very well at making the surfaces vibration free (which 
is all that Dynamat does). This material is available from any flat roof 
contractor and is called a variety of names including walk pads. They use 
it to create walk paths around rooftop equipment because flat roofs are not 
supposed to be walked on alot directly. I got enough for an extensive job 
in my bus and my Beetle for $45 or so locally.

It has no stink like some materials. I tested this by placing the whole 
roll in my bus and left it out there all last summer and this summer (the 
bus has been off the road that long...). I have added a layer inside the 
front doors, the nose and the sliding door. I plan to add it to the wall 
cavities in the rear of the bus and the rear door. Also it will be applied 
to all of the flat floor surfaces. I will also create a large mat for under 
and behind the rear seat but I plan to create a sealed mat sandwich with 
some of the reflective insulation material available from Lowe's and other 
large hardware stores. This material has Jute inside two faces of aluminum 
foil essentially. It doesn't do the best job of insulating noise out 
because it is thin and has very little mass. This will help keep the engine 
heat out of the bus though - a real problem for us in the summer when our 
bus has gotten the most use. Basically I'll lay out a layer of the 
reflective material and then ontop of that I'll lay a layer of the Poor 
Man's Dynamat (tm). The PMD will be 2 inches smaller at the edges than the 
reflective stuff and I'll poor some upholstery glue all around there. On 
top will go another layer of the reflective material. The glue will seal it 
up and it will be laid into the rear of the bus. I'll probably add some 
velcro strips to hold it in place. I'll also add some spots of glue in the 
middle to to help it keep it's shape. Ontop of that will go a layer of 
under carpet foam and then the carpet.

This will help with one more problem I see with my PMD: it gets soft with 
extreme temps. I'll explain more.

Any roofing material is supposed to get very soft with applied heat so that 
it forms itself to the surface it is covering. This material does not get 
soft with interior temps even when the bus is in the summer sun. The max my 
temps my bus has seen has probably not been over 125 degrees F. Those temps 
have not caused any of this material to soften and sag or run. In my 
experiments to fasten it to the inside of the doors I used a torch. With 
enough heat - direct flame - it will turn to an black oil and drip and run. 
Direct flame though remember.

The material has two sides. The first is the top and is much like a rubber 
mat with a bit of ground up stone in it  to make it more durable to foot 
traffic. It is a tough surface and pretty smooth. It is NOT like the 
surface of an asphalt house shingle. It has some of the same aggregate like 
I mentioned but is vastly smaller quantities.

The second side is a smooth tar like surface and comes with a plastic 
wrapper that is supposed to be peeled off. With the application of enough 
heat this is the side that will soften and become sticky (or run with 
extreme heat).

My first method of sticking this material to the bus was to spray it with 
upholstery adhesive. Didn't hold. I went back and cleaned the metal with 
paint prep. Lot's of dirt and dust came off. Tried again after reading the 
can that said to spray both surfaces and wait a couple of minutes. I knew 
this but was lazy. This worked pretty good. Still inside the doors some of 
the corners rolled up a bit. Still very effective to dampen the 
sheetmetal's tendency to buzz. The portions of the bus that have been 
treated thump versus ring like a big metal barrel like before.

So what is the perfect solution for vertical surfaces? The horizontal 
surfaces handle the material and glue just fine - buy a quart of it and 
brush it on though. This might work for the vertical surfaces too. The 
panels I created for the sliding door were applied while the door was 
laying on a pair of sawhorses. I heated the &quot;pads&quot; until the tar side was 
soft and runny. Then using a wooden block I pressed them into place forcing 
them to match the contour of the door's interior bracing. It has held for 6 
months without nary a lifted corner.

For the front doors I am going to have to go back and repair some of the 
lifted corners. I have tried heat but I can't apply enough of it without 
worrying about warping the doors or burning the paint. I plan to try to 
brush some adhesive onto the surfaces OR and this is my big idea: 
construction adhesive.

I plan to get a tube tonight and try it. The biggest problem with my noise 
insulation job has been that I left the material in a roll for over a year 
after I bought it (had a child, bought a house, changed jobs, etc.) It 
wants to stay in a rolled shape. I did not apply enough heat to make it 
flatten out before I applied it to the doors. It has peeled where I applied 
it to the inside of the doors inside the beltline. Most of the other places 
it has been just fine. I can't pull it off because where I got enough glue 
it is there for good. To get the corners to lay right I'll have to get some 
better adhesive in there - thus the brushed on glue or construction adhesive.

Just food for thought.

I plan to build door panels from sealed Luan, then with upholstery over a 
layer of foam to aid noise control. I plan to do the same with the ceiling 
panels over the cab also do the same with the panels over the rear seat 
(which is the bottom of the upper bed).

This is how we've always built our hot rods with VERY good results.

The carpet will be laid over a layer of carpet foam. The foam under the 
carpet in the house is open cell foam on one side and closed on the top. 
Looks like a nice cheap alternative. Under that carpet foam will be a layer 
of the PMD (tm). I'm seriously considering doing away with the wooden panel 
that was originally under the carpet. If I don't do away with it - it will 
be under the carpet foam and over the asphalt material.

HEATER BLOWER HOSES

Over the past 10 years I have bought many replacement hoses that are 
designed to connect the Beetle shroud to the heater boxes or on the Type IV 
connect the aux blower to the heater boxes. Some of the replacement hoses 
are black aluminum hoses and some were bright silver. I think I have a 
cheap source for you.

Visit your local commercial heating and cooling contractor.... I was 
watching a home improvement show while I ate lunch on Saturday when I 
noticed Bob Villa's heating &amp; cooling man demonstrating an installation 
with none other than the same hose I had been buying from the aftermarket 
catalogs. He had lengths in the &quot;feet&quot; versus the short inches I had been 
getting from the catalogs. I suspect they are very cheap. Take along an old 
section of hose when you go searching. I doubt Lowe's has this - probably a 
local contractor would. We've got a local one that will walk me through his 
warehouse and let me hunt for a solution when I am fabbing a project. My 
cost is a few dollars versus the many dollars some of the flashy catalogs 
sell their for. Just like the $100 aux blower kits that are actually $16 
marine bilge blowers, $5 switches and $5 of wire and other minor electrical 
things.

Hope this helps somebody!!!
