&gt;Actually Biagio me (Tim) and my girlfriend (Heather) just finished doing
&gt;such a thing back in December. We set off in August not knowing where we
&gt;were headed or when we would be back.

&gt;exactly 4 months after we had left.....

&gt;Grand total over 14,000 miles.......

Tim,
You didn't mention, after 4 months and 14,000 miles in a splittie, did your
relationship with Heather hold up as well as your bus?
