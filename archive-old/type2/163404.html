Subject: Re: [T2] dual vacuum dizzy

Gary -

Sounds like the distributor you were supplied with is a Bug Upright 1600
style, based on the description you provide.

To properly ID this distributor I would need at least the Bosch number
stamped into the casing.  There is also the VW number stamped into the
casing as well.  Once I have those I can give an educated guess to all of
the questions.

Single Vac Distributors were used on Late 76-78 Buses, &amp; 79-83 Federal
Bus/Vanagons, all equipped with points/condensor, timed at 7.5 degrees
BTDC.  Dual Vac 79-83 California Bus/Vanagons were equipped with Hall
Ignition, timed at 5 degrees ATDC

&gt; Just last week someone wrote the list about a problem that turned out to
&gt; be timing with one of the distributors that have dual vacuum lines , one
&gt; for advance and one for retard. I have motor here I am trying to get
&gt; together to put back in my  80 westy. I provided a engine  rebuilder
&gt; with my engine and he was supposed to put my accessories on a rebuilt
&gt; short block and send it back to me, well what I got back has none of my
&gt; accessories,   it has this dual vac distributor on it now , this is a 2
&gt; liter, air-cooled, fuel injected motor,  here are my questions:
&gt;
&gt; -Is there any advantage to this one over a distributor with a single
&gt; vacuum line?
&gt;
&gt; -Can I just swap this with a standard single line one and time it to 7.5
&gt; BTDC ? (I plan on using one off a 78  2 liter Air cooled FI motor)
&gt;
&gt; -It looks like the notch for the # 1 position on this dual one is in a
&gt; different place, does that mean I need to change the distributor drive
&gt; gear setting ?
&gt;
&gt; -From looking through the shop manual it looks like this dual one was to
&gt; be used in vehicles with electronic ignition , but this one has points
&gt; in it so what vehicles used these?
&gt;
&gt; Any info much appreciated
