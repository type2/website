Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

I might be wrong here but according to the welder that 
just did some work on my camper, having no gas is more 
dangerous due to the build up of easily ignitable 
fumes.  A full tank was his preference.

Any other thoughts on this?

Cheers,

&gt; Just drive until you have almost no gas at all in the tank, then do your 
&gt; cutting? Is there a fire risk with cutting out this access hole just above 
&gt; the actual gas tank with gas still in it?
&gt; 
&gt; I would prefer not to go up in flames if I can help it.
