Okay, I've given the alleged 2.0l a minor tune up, oil, filter, and plugs,
and it really smokes now. the smoke smells like gas, and when I pull of the
individual plug wires, the engine doesn't lose much RPM.  The spark looks
weak, but not that weak.  I let some light into the advance mech, and it
works OK.  I pulled off the valve covers, and everything is dry in there. 
Weird...  I set it up to adjust Cyl #1 valves, and they are both full
tight.  I'm gonna assume that unless they are around 2 turns tight, then
they are conventional lifters.  I'm thinkin' that way too tight valves
would cause a unburned gas smoke situation like I have.  Can anybody
confirm?   Hmmm...  Well, gonna go get dirty (again).  are there engine
serial #s which would indicate hydraulic lifters?
