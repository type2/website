&lt;Someone (Steve Dolan??) stated earlier that they checked 10 early bays at
EB and ALL had .009 dizzys. I have owned 3 different buses with T1 engines,
and ALL of these had .009.  Yet the general consensus is that these are
BAD&gt;

Ever since I started poking around type2_dot_com and fixing my own bus (when
possible) I've seen the warnings about 009 distributors.  So, of course,
I knew I would never get one because they seem to be inherently evil.

But wait a second, now you guys have me all freaked out!  If almost
every early bay seems to have a 009, I better ask if you can tell me
what mine is:

http://www.erniesdeli_dot_com/plaidbuspage.html

That's the distributor in my 1969 bus.  Maybe you can't tell what kind
it is from the pics.  If so, how can I tell?  Numbers on it somewhere?
 I hate to sound like an idiot (but secretly I know I am) -I've adjusted
the timing per Muir's instructions several times and it seems to be fine...

Thanks y'all!
