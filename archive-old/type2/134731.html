Subject: Re: [T2] Bay westie side tent poles

From: &quot;doc ric&quot; &lt;uncleric_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; See the first picture on this site. That is the part I am talking about.

Thanks, Ric.  I wasn't sure if it was metal or plastic.  I though it might
be something to cast along with the Westy hooks for the tent.

Which, by the way, does anyone have an extra hook I can borrow for mastering
one?
