My own experience is that with an honest appraisal of the condition of the
vehicle in question the price guide has been pretty close to what I've had to
pay or have gotten for vehicles in the recent past.  My vanagon for example is
listed at  1500 to 3000  and though I paid $300 for it, by the time it was in
running order I had put close to $3000 with my labour being included at a very
cheap rate,  I bought a Volvo for 1200 but by the time it was all ship shape I
was well into the 3000 range which is the most I could hope to get for it.  On
the selling side I had a fairly poor ghia for which I was lucky to get $1400
while the guide had me at $  A1200 or so for that car.  A Nissan I sold with
dreams of making a few bucks also ended up just where the book suggested it
might be.    I surely don't take the book as a bible, but as a reference it has
borne out in my limited experience
