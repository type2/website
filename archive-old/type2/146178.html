&gt; I read down to the vehicles stats.  VW seems to never learn.  Leather
&gt; seats,
&gt; powered sliding doors, a five screen theater system...
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't sound like it's going to be affordable. :O(
&gt;
&gt;    VW isn't playing to the cheap seats anymore...It doesn't
want to be associated with the likes of Kia or any of the
&quot;entry level&quot; car companies...The Phaeton is the type of
car VW would prefer to sell. A VW mini van can't be cheap
if VW is to control its upscale image...
