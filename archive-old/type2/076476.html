Subject: i got a 74 westy

Hello all,
 I am finally got a bus again. I picked up a 74 westy from a friend . It has
a nice interior, This is the first post 72 bus ive ever owned. It has an
interior I am not familiar to.  I believe it is missing the stove and I am
in search of the blue/green plaid upholstery for the front seats. Any one
have these? Are there any sites out there where I can see pictures of the
interiors of these westys? I looked on thesamba and didn't see any thing.
 Later ,
 Bryan
