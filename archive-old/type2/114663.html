&lt;&lt; As a bus guy, am I going to notice 50lbs of soundproofing when my engine is
already underpowered and I've accepted that? Probably not, so that's why
we're lucky ;)

Actually, you will, if not on a daily basis, then at the end of the year in 
the
gas bills...Every extra pound costs, especially on a low-powered vehicle,
and especially further down the road when the engine needs a new clutch
a little earlier or the engine needs rebuilding a few thousand miles sooner.
It's the power-to-weight ratio that controls everything on a vehicle (fac-
tor in the drag, too, but there's not much to control there on a bus).
