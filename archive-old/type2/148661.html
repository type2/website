Well the planets have lined up and I have begun the process of moving 
out of my shop. I have several interior westy cabinets from a 75 
campmobile,78 westy, and a z bed. I have a 75 shell which has good    
windows, and lots of spare nick knacks, including an engine that is of 
unknown condition. If you need anything please let me know and I'll let 
you know if I have it. All must go so any reasonable offer will be 
accepted, I am located in Queens NY.
Cheers
