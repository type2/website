Subject: RE: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

The added weight of the fuel filter when its full of fuel combined with
the vibration of the engine has been known to pull the fuel line loose.
If this happens, then the engine will continue to run until the gas runs
out of the carburetor bowl. In the meantime the mechanical fuel pump is
spraying the engine, ignition wires, distributor, coil, and electrical
connections with gasoline. The type2 library has an article on how to
secure your fuel lines.

Another weak point in the fuel supply system is the hard line as it
passes through the fan shroud sheetmetal There should be a nice fresh
pliable rubber grommet in the sheetmetal. The rubber grommet protects
the fuel line from the sharp edges of the sheetmetal. Unprotected, the
sheetmetal can wear a hole in the fuel line and leaks all over the
driver's side cylinders and head. This is how my mother lost our beloved
71 bug.

Go to www.type2_dot_com and read all the library articles. The FUEL section
covers much that I've spoke about.

Everyone, didn't Bob Hoover have an article concerning how to fabricate
a permanent pass through for the fuel line?

Steve
