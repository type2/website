Subject: Re: [T2] Electric or Propane conversions

&gt; &gt;Does anyone have any information on Electric or Propane conversions for type
&gt; &gt;2s?  What I'd love to do is convert the bus to electric and wire in a small
&gt; &gt;Honda generator making it a hybrid.  Has anyone done this?
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure someone has tried it.  Know that a &quot;small Honda generator&quot; isn't 
&gt;going to be nearly enough to keep the batteries charged while you 
&gt;drive.  An electric bus will draw 30-40,000 watts or more during 
&gt;acceleration and maybe 10,000 watts while cruising.  I guess a small 
&gt;generator could improve the range somewhat but it isn't going to make the 
&gt;vehicle self-sustaining.

David's right. I was hot on building an electric car a couple of years ago 
and you've got to understand an electric's limitations.

1st - most home built vehicles big and small will go no more than 75 miles 
on a charge. You can take a larger vehicle and stuff more batteries in it 
but ultimately the extra weight is going to keep your range between 50 and 
75 miles. Popular conversion cars are compacts like Rabbits, Horizons, and 
Escorts. Light hatchback cars with lots of luggage space. The builders are 
putting some batteries up front and some out back to distribute the weight. 
And that's ALOT of weight. The corporate built cars have fancy things like 
regenerative braking (making power while you coast to a stop).

Now 50-75 miles would be just great for me because I commute about 10 miles 
each way to work at speeds of 30-45 mph. I could drive over half a week 
before I HAD to charge. If I added 3 solar cells to the roof - in the 
summer maybe I could stretch that by a day. The best E-car was GM's car and 
it went over 100 miles and that was the result of millions of dollars of 
design work. Us home builders can't match that. Maybe you could add some 
range with a generator to GM's car but the added weight of a trailer and 
generator would probably nix that. It could potentially charge the 
batteries while you were at work or in class but the fuel burned and the 
noise and the pollution that carbureted non-pollution controlled generator 
will not leave you with much advantage in any category - noise, pollution, 
fuel, or cost. It's going to do less for a big E-bus.

A generator found at the hardware store makes about 4K watts. They are 
designed for occasional (not full time, they are light duty) use and would 
have to run most of day to charge the batteries I suspect.

There are a few people that have vast solar arrays on the roof of their 
house, a windmill in the back field and make their own power with enough 
left over to charge a commuter vehicle like a GM or a home built. I hope to 
be one of those folks eventually but the total cost of those systems is 
$25K or more. No cost advantage to be sure unless you plan to maintain the 
system it's full life. Takes something like 10 years for the system to pay 
for itself and it may not power big loads like an electric washer/dryer or 
heat pump. Since I like my heat pump I'll have to add to my power &quot;system&quot; 
passive heating (windows) to take the load off. Let's just say that I'm 
still in the dream / armchair phase of this project.

There are a couple of yahoo groups that discuss E-power for vehicles (have 
built them). Another good website is www.homepower_dot_com . They offer a free 
magazine to download every two months. I read it each time. Also Mother 
Earth news has some good stuff in it.

All that said, we as a society could be energy independent from the rest of 
the world if our current energy infrastructure was altered. If the initial 
cost to setup a renewable energy infrastructure was supplemented like the 
cost of our roads, airlines, oil production, etc. we could be independent 
of the Arabs.

Wouldn't that get their goats!!! (I'd love it!!!)

I figure though that there is too much money and politics to let oil die 
too quickly - at least until the current money people have enough fingers 
in renewable energy to make money as oil declines and solar and wind 
advances. Several of the big oil companies have bought out solar 
manufacturers. Hopefully it is to advance the cause and not snuff it out 
like the mythical 100 mpg carbs &lt;grin&gt;.

The main reason alot of technology hasn't advanced any further is due to 
the cost to the consumer (cost to manufacture) but with enough big money 
behind it we could see the cost per watt drop drastically.

As for powering your Bus with propane or natural gas - it is being done 
every day around the world. Talk to folks in Europe or Canada or Australia. 
Folks where I lived in Italy would run dual fuel systems. Propane was 
cheaper (lower tax rate?) than gasoline. Because the dual fuel option was 
there, it was easy to run around town on propane and switch to gas if you 
couldn't find propane to fill up again. Also seems like one of those two 
gasses (propane or NG) is not polluting - exhaust is mostly (ALL?) water vapor.

I hope I've sparked your imagination with a few ideas - none facts. Start 
Googling you way around the web and I think you'll find a library of info. 
I did a bunch of research on all this (electric) 2 years ago but never 
followed through (finances, school, work, family) so my memory is not clear 
on the details. Also check the archives. Somebody (a teacher) has done this 
before.

By the time I get around to pursuing this project all the technology will 
be different...
