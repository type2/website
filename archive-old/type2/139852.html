&gt; Preamble: Yes, I know this is not the _right_ way to do bodywork and

But it will work

&gt; Okay, here's the thing. Peregrine is the wrong color. Actually, the bus
&gt; is stock '76 chrome yellow. Has never been repainted. Standard

yeah mine too, it was all babyshit green (sage green)
hated it.

&gt; I want Peregrine to be &quot;polar blue,&quot; or approximately the same color as
&gt; that &quot;show bus&quot; that I posted last week. But there is a lot of bodywork
&gt; standing between me and a good paint job. Not to mention that

did mine in a Metalic bright blue lower and bright white upper

&gt; thoroughly upgraded mechanicals are my highest priority.

yup just finishing up the mechanicals,
&gt;
&gt; Every once in a while, I start to wonder why I can't follow this scheme:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Wash and prep sand the lower panels
&gt; 2. Hit the rusty spots (dents and gouges) with POR and sand
&gt; 3. Spray on sealer
I skipped this step
&gt;
&gt; 4. Spray one good coat of the right color, single stage

heck I rattle canned mine
&gt;
&gt; 5. Relax about the danged color, even though the dents and creases are
&gt; still there, and holes are covered with fiberglass
&gt;
&gt; 6. Do bodywork, section by section, &quot;in my spare time&quot; -- some welding
&gt; here and there, down to metal where absolutely necessary, good primer,
&gt; respraying with the same paint
&gt;
&gt; 7. Eventually, when I have done the whole bus, sand one more time and
&gt; paint with two-stage paint.
&gt;

my goal,

&gt; Question: Any tips on how to follow this plan and make sure that
&gt; everything adheres well when I get around to (7)?

I did that in 1993 and it is still hanging in there, (photos in John
Browns Buses 2003 &amp; 2004 greg potts site)

I used good quality rattle cans and it has held up pretty well, I am
finally getting around to body work.. the mechanicals took a lot longer
than planned, (don't they always)

good luck it will work
Bob
