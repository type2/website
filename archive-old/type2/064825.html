Subject: Re:Car Value Guide 

One thing I wonder about is can people actually realize any appraised
value? First off, no matter what you think, you should probably step your
van down one step from what condition you think it is? I find looking at my van,
its just perfect, but when I look at other vehicles I notice lots of stuff;-)
 Second is this appraised value question? My brother in-law has 7 antique
cars. He hasn't paid more than 60% of the 'appraised value' for any of them,
but is convinced that he could sell any of them for AT_LEAST the appraised
value tommorrow. Of course he is new enough in the hobby that he hasn't 
ever sold one yet;-) We shall see. He is about to try to sell one of them
for $1000.00 _more_ that it is apraised at, because he is including a parts car
with it. As in appraised at $6500, for sale for $7500. We'll see, but if
I take his ratio of purchase price to appraised value as a guide, he'll only
get $4300? Of course he is a much smarter buyer than everone else, and 
everyone in the world wants a 47 Plymouth in catagory 4 shape? RIGHT!

My take on ratings: My van with 50,000 miles, and all original parts
including original tires, and ZERO rust, no rustoration was a catagory 3. 
The engine fire has reduced it to a catagory 4, but with some cleanup, and
replacing _all_ damaged parts, I could get it back to a 3. Comments?
