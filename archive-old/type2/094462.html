&gt; I am sitting here in front of my rebuilt 914 engine. I
&gt; am currently installing some of the engine tin. My
&gt; question is, can I completely assemble the engine
&gt; before I install it in my bus? Can I go ahead and
&gt; install the parts of the f.i. that attach to the
&gt; engine? Would it be easier to put the foam seal that
&gt; goes around the perimeter of the engine tin before or
&gt; after I install it?

Put all this stuff on:

Here's what I did: fit the seal at the back of the engine as you put the
engine back in, then secure the engine, add the rest of the tin and fit the
rest of the seal as you go around towards the front.

You'll have to go under the van to help pull the seal through in places.
