Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

Gawrsh... You make me blush... Say it again!

Actually, I had forgotten about that right up to that
point while I was typing and it came back to me as I
was searching the FI theory traces in my brain! Thanks
for the good words - it makes this all very
satisfying! -BaH

 First you show me how to hook up my $7.00
 &quot;stupid-proof&quot; remote starter and
 then you point out how to make my Westy run! What a
 great weekend this has
 turned out to be!
 
 Literally one turn of the starter and wham, like a
 kitten. Now to explain to
 my neighbors why I was revving my bus, jumping
 around and laughing manically
 without any liquor...
 
 Thanks Dave! The next BBB (or anytime we meet) I owe
 you a keg, leg of lamb
 or whatever... don't let me forget!
