On my '74 Westy, I installed the new canvas bottom first and top last because it did not make any sense to do it the other way as the instructions stated.  What I ended up doing is to install the bottom part of the canvas to the roof of the bus and then pop the top all the way and start at the front center of the canvas (this being a late model type pop top).  To install the top portion of canvas, I used a short piece of yardstick and draped the canvas over, held it in place, and then pushed the yardstick up into the corner of the roof.  This way you can change the tightness of the canvas without having to staple, check the tightness, unstaple, adjust, restaple, etc., etc.  I then worked from the front to the back evenly on both sides.  This made more sense to me since 1. you can adjust as needed, 2. you don't have to staple the same place numerous times (which cannot be good for the new canvas) and 3. you do not need to keep popping the roof up and down.  The whole process of installing the new canvas took about 3 hours in total.

I don't know if I'm missing something here but this process sure made more sense to me than installing the top first.

I agree, there has to be a better way to install the canvas.  If you look at 
the new EuroVan Weekender, or even the later Vanagons, the canvas can be 
installed from the bottom up.  Instead of the top being stapled first, the 
bottom is put in place and the top has a metal trim piece that covers up the 
staples.  If I ever put another canvas in my bus, I'm going to make my own 
trim so I can put it in this same way.
