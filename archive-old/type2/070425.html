&gt;Do people actually know the origin of that bear?

I'm not sure of the &quot;official&quot; origin of the GD bears, but suspect that
whoever started them &quot;borrowed&quot; the original bear. One of the dancing
bears looks just like the trademark bear for Bear Alignment systems.
Check it out next time you pass a shop with the yellow Bear Alignment
