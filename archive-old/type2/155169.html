Subject: Book review question

For me a good part of the pleasure of working on my old Type 2 is NOT having to 
deal with 21st century technology... but at some point I've gotta bite the 
bullet and try to learn about on-board diagnostics, for a start.

Does anyone have any thoughts on these (or related) titles??

IIRC, several of you fellow list members are in the education field.  I did a 
search for a few possible books to buy; I get the feeling these are textbooks.  
Possibly if I wait a year or two they would be remaindered -- i.e., available 
cheaply.  But if I want one now, I am looking at 40-60 bucks minimum.  Any help 
and/or recomms will be appreciated.  Thanks and have a great day!!
