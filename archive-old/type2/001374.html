&gt; Whoa whoa whoa!
&gt;
&gt; Do I see that they have German Heat Exchangers for
&gt; US$165 a pair? I thought these were NLA.
&gt;
&gt; I'm in for 2 pairs if we want to do a group import purchase.  Anyone know
&gt; how we can get these in the USA for US$200 pair with shipping?


Actually, even less.  This is one of the parts deals that I found when doing
scouting through Germany and Europe.  I have 30 pair coming, for $149.95 a
pair (plus shipping from Pennsylvania).  These will not last long, so let me
know right away if you'd like them.  They should arrive in about 10 days.

I also bought the following genuine N.O.S. German heat exchangers for Type 4
engines:
'72-74 Bus (left side only) :  $139.95  (Inferior Danish ones currently sell
for $199)
'80-83 Vanagon:  329.95/PAIR  (Danish is normally $400-500/pair)
Heater Control Box for 72-79 bus (lever part that attaches to heat
exchanger)  $79.95/PAIR
Plastic &quot;accordion-like&quot; heater tubes that connect to the above (new German
stock, previously unavailable) $39.95/pair

These are the same heat exchangers that I had available about two years ago,
but my supply ran out.  They have been out of production for years, but I
had a lead on some when I went to Europe this month, and sure enough it
worked out. These are original-equipment Volkswagen German heat exchangers,
not Danish or Brazilian. They are MUCH more substantial than even the best
ones available today.  The 1600cc ones have linkages positioned to fit
'68-71 busses.  You can also use them on pre-68 busses but you would have to
modify/rig the linkage since it is on the other side (or simply wire the
heat exchanger open during the winter).

Anyone interested should e-mail me right away.  For now I am offering them
to list members only.  The general public will get a crack at them early
next week if there are any left (but at a somewhat higher price).
