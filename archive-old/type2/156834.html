&gt; Some colors aren't UV resistant. At least that was the case in 96 when I
&gt; wanted to get my truck lined in white. I would have needed a clear coating
&gt; on it to provide UV resistance or the stuff would have quickly gone brittle.
&gt; The shop said no problem with most colors, but white required this special
&gt; treatment.

That was worth a giggle.  A protective coating for a protective coating!


Interesting that it was white.  Usually, white paint is one of the more
durable colors.  It's also the only color that would go on top of my bus.
VW painted 'em white for a reason!
