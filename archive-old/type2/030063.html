&gt; Quoth Alan , post CV job:

&gt; Trust me, if you saw my solvent damaged fingertips (VW work since 1972,
&gt; electron microscope/histology lab work)-easily cracking thickend,
&gt; nonelastic skin at the high stress zones- at my age (56) you'd use the
&gt; nitrile gloves...

Amen to that!  One positive side effect to the nasty communicable diseases
that have happened upon us in the last couple of decades is the
availability of cheap disposable gloves.  I use the disposable nitrile
gloves whenever I get near the engine.  Makes an oil change/valve
adjustment a quick cleanup activity, rather than spending a half-hour with
Lava soap.
