Hello folks,
     I have recently landed a 71 (excellent condition) with un unbelievable oil leak.  After pulling the engine, I popped the valve covers to find 3 head bolts hitting the driveway.  The &quot;master mechanic&quot; that allowed this to be driven must also have overheated the engine as well because after we placed new rings and gaskets throughout, reinstalled the engine, etc., I can only get 50psi per cylinder.  The heads are now torqued, and were soaked in cleaner before re-installation, and didn't have any signs of damage.  I realize that the rings could take a little time to seat but I have driven it all last weekend and cannot gain any more pressure.  Top speed, 45MPH, ain't gonna do.  Has this ever happened to anyone?

Billy
