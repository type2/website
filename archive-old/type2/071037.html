forgetfull, i took out my new rear engine hatch seal and thought i would put 
it on the roof a few minutes to soften it up and check out my heater boxes 
and replace the tubes coming off the fan shroudwell after doing that i took 
it out for a drive and as soon as i got back in the drive guess what i 
rememberd on the roof yep the seal i retraced my drive and low and behold 
there it was in the middle of a very busy street after i got a break and 
picked it up it didnt even have a tear in it just tire marks i was impressed 
i dont know where RON at BUSDEPOT gets his rubber but its good.             
all my best from clearwater florida
