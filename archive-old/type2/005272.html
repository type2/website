&gt; Hey Grant, list
&gt;
&gt; Just took the bus out for a rather crude test. I took a 1 hour run, the
same
&gt; run I had taken several weeks ago under similar conditions. I ran the bus
at
&gt; 70 mph. The earlier readings after one hour were 256 degrees and slowly
but
&gt; steadily rising. Today the temp seemed to level off at about 251 degrees.
&gt; (it's about 93 degrees out today)At 60-65 (normal driving speeds for me)
the
&gt; temps seem to steady at about 230. It seems like a drop of about 5 degrees
&gt; after my fan was cleaned, results preliminary. BTW, after two hours on my
&gt; knees I began to wonder whether or not the fan can be removed without
&gt; dropping the engine. Would anyone happen to know? Bentley didn't clear
this
&gt; up for me. Looks like there are three 12 point socket-head screws holding
it
&gt; on.
&gt; Thanks
