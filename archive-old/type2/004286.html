Subject: AIRS

Hey list
AIRS is currently updated at 1099 members. I was waiting to post that until
Ken fixed the cgi-bin for the sign-up and edit form(which has been down
since the type2 server went haywire) but its still not fixed. So to all you
out there that keep sending me P-mail having &quot;trouble&quot; trying to sign-up,
please have patience, Thanks.
You'll know when its fixed depending on the message you get when you hit
'sign me up'

-Wade
