I am getting 18.54 MPG on my 70 Westy which has a very well maintained 
engine.
5.39 gallons gets me 100 miles down the road.
This is a consumption number for a mixed bag of city and highway driving.

Highway cruising is at 55-60 MPH, and city driving at a very safe 
acceleration rate way over in the slow lane with my eyes continuously 
scanning for death ray emissions from those great American land pig SUV 
things out there on the tarmac driven with a lipstick wand in one hand 
and a cell phone in the other.

Billy Bob Pickup Lane Changer with his Lone Star nestled down beneath 
the eyes of revenue collector cops stays way over in the far left lane, 
so he has no impact on my mileage being varied from life saving braking 
actions.
