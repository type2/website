Subject: Any Input?!

Planning on trip to Maine, by way of Canada, towards the end of the
month.

I haven't been across the border in years, and then I didn't look like a
long haired,
VW driving friek.

I have heard a few horror stories and I want to avoid such
inconveniences.

The particulars are:

Young Couple who tend to wear tie-dye and hemp attire
w/ 2 year old Sharpei (Also enjoys colorful adornment)

Traveling in '78 custom camper with tie-dye curtains, stickered windows
and slightly
noisy exhaust.  With minimal bread and the intent to camp along the
way.  Crossing into CANADA through Sault Ste Marie with destination
being somewhere in Maine.  Then returning to our humble abode via U.S.
highways and byways.

I realize controlled substances are not a portable item for this trip.

I am concerned about problems with our k-9 family member and possibly
just a general
disapproval of our lifestyle.

Also looking for places to camp, a route to take or just any other
opinions, info, advisement's, points of interest ..........

TIA

P.S. A big thanks to Ron and everyone else at Bus Depot,  the new heater
boxes Kick Ass!!
