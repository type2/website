Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Bus for sale

Don't worry. Those grow back! (Lives that is) Just give it a bit of
time. And if it makes ya' feel any better, just think of ME and all the
work I have yet to do. Some SERIOUS fabricating and welding. At least
your rust isn't all the way through. :) (I hope) Not to mention that by
the time you replace/repair/rebuild everything that's wrong, you'll have
a NEW bus that you know inside and out. And when/if anything ever goes
wrong, you'll know JUST what it is, becouse you put it their!

&gt; So far, all it's done is suck the
&gt; life out of me.
