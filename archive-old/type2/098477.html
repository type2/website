Subject: ADMIN: Re: [T2] Interesting bus for parts or restoration on
  eBay

Folks, if you read your charter, found at
http://www.type2_dot_com/type2.html
you will find the following text:

------------------------
--Do not try to advertise your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to know what is for sale on
eBay we will go there and look.
------------------------

Unfortunately, the filter isn't doing the job, so it's up to the list
members to use their self-restraint.  The message in the charter is quite
clear so please pay attention.

If you find yourself thinking &quot;gee, I don't remember reading that in the
charter&quot; I suggest that you read the whole thing again.

George Lyle, list admin first shift
