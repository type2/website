Subject: RE: [T2] rear vent window

Pete,

This is another BUStedBUS_dot_com specialty. We sell complete vent wing windows
including frame for $75.00. In this case it sounds like you only need the
glass? Just the glass sells for $16.77. On Halloween someone broke into my
and my girlfriends cars and stole both the stereos. They also ripped apart
the dashes on both cars. I just got off the phone with the detective this
morning and they think that they have a suspect. Hopefully helping you out
will help me feel better about my problems. Let me know if this works for
you. You should also get a new seal for this it sells for $7.60.

Subject: [T2] rear vent window


Hi All,

Recently, somebody broke into my girlfriend's '77 just to wreak some havoc.
In doing so, the destroyed the driver's side, rear vent window. Its right in
front of the bench seat. I'd also call it a wing window, but that's from my
Marlboro days. Anyway, if anyone has a replacement, with the latch,  I could
buy, or know of a place to acquire, I would appreciate it.
Local pick &amp; pays didn't have it.

thanks,

Pete
