&gt;Mechanically, I am a MORON! I was having a starting problem on my 75 bus

&gt;easy to follow instructions, I found my problem,apparently an old &quot;dirty 
&gt;or rusty solenoid&quot; and fixed it temporarily (thank you Mr. Ball Peen 
&gt;Hammer).  My 2 questions is this: 1)How long can I expect to continue with 
&gt;the solenoid in this shape?
================================&gt;
The solenoid will change shape every time you hit it with the hammer.
