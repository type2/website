Subject: Re: [T2] Re: dropped exhaust valve seat on avp head (i think) 
  longish  story

Dang, guys.  These things came with a cylinder to spare!  :)  Good to know you can get by on three.   Probably get REALLY angry looks then, though.  My problems seem to be solved now.  Now I can get to work on my 2.0.  Gonna put brand new heads on that one.  Two AVP horror stories in two weeks got my attention.  Off to disconnect that spare cylinder...KR

Coming down for John Brown's Buses 2006 I drove from BuffaloNY -  
Bedford MD and home to Toronto ON, on three cylinders, that's about  
800 miles.

&gt; hey Guys  You would be surprized how far you can drive on three   
&gt; clylinders,
&gt; Take the push rod out for the valve that has problems,  disconnect the
&gt; injector for that clylinder and drive it home.  I drove my  59  
&gt; panel 250 miles like
&gt; that once.   I now have AAA that tows up to  100 miles .  later
