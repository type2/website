Here is a little note I put together over 4 years ago about using Vanagon
electronic ignition in a type4 engined bus.


 What you need:
 a 79 Calif bus donor or
 a 80-83 Calif Vanagon donor
 heatsink w/module
 distributor
 harness from module to dist. to coil
 bosch electronic coil (get one from a Rabbit -they work better then the
 Vanagon because of the heat they lived with before-Rabbits have cooler
engine compartments)

 On the harness there are 6 wires coming out of the module plug. About 4&quot;
from the module is a single plug [blackwire]=this wire goes to the positive
side of the coil. About 15&quot; from the plug the harness splits=the 3 wire plug
goes to the dist. Vanagon harness's also have an idle stabilizer module in
series. If you use a Vanagon harness, just connect the two 3-wire plugs
together. The brown wire is ground=it plugs onto the ground terminal at the
top of the case where it's bolted together (if your case doesn't have
this,some Vanagons don't, use any good ground spot on the case). The fifth
wire [green] goes to the negative side of the coil.

 There is a difference in the position of where the two distributors
sit--this one is about 90 degrees off. On top of the dist. where the cap
sits is a notch--this is where the rotor points for #1 to fire. Set your
timing mark to zero and pop off your cap--your rotor should be pointing to
this notch. If it's 180 off turn your crank 360 again-it should line up
unless someone put your dist. drive gear in the wrong position. Pull out
your dist. and drop in the new one-it will only go all the way down
in one position (the slot is offset). Where the rotor is pointing is #1 to
fire. You can either leave it like this and move your plug wires accordingly
or reset the position of the drive gear (preferred way). If you move your
drive gear don't loose the spring on top of it. Be very careful lifting up
the drive gear--it turns as you lift it--you just want to lift it enough to
turn it. There is a thrust washer under it that will fall into the case
(ouch). You may have to do this a couple of times--put dist. in,see where it
points,move gear,put dist.in etc.

 The Vanagon dist.has a dual vacuum unit--if your engine has a dual unit
hook it up the same way as it was=manifold vacuum (vacuum at idle) to the
inner nipple, ported vacuum (vacuum when you open the throttle) to the outer
nipple. Time it the same as the old distributor.

 Benefits are:
 -never change points again
 -timing never changes (as the point rubbing block wears the dwell
changes--when dwell changes the timing changes)
 -parts availability (the module and coil are in Rabbits and 4-cyl Audi)
 -coil output is always at maximum (dirty points lower coil output).
