Check the oil pressure sending unit, which is located at about the ten =
o'clock position from the distributor as you look down at the engine =
through the top engine hatch. It may have ruptured. You'll need a =
deep-well 15/16&quot; or its metric equivalent to remove and replace it with =
a new unit. Don't overtighten it, just snug and a tad more. It's not =
expensive (about $7-$15).

If it's not that, it could be the oil cooler seals, pushrod tube seals, =
front seal, etc.

Buena Suerte,

its coming out and pouring down over the left (drivers) side heater box. =

Pushrod tube seals gone very bad I guess?

I scheduled an appointment with Tassi in Daly City tomorrow to have them =
as=20
well as the exhaust manifold gaskets, as a friend mentioned that my =
motor=20
sounded as though those were going bad/already bad as well.
