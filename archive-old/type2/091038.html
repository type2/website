Subject: Re: [T2] rear main seal, oil leak

to clarify, if the front of the bus is the front of the engine, then
the seal on the flywheel side of the engine could be considered the
front seal as well. So w/ this in mind the seal next to the fan should
be the &quot;no really we mean it rear seal&quot; :)
