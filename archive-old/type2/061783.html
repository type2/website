&gt;Anyone have any experience with these?  Do you remove it each morning?  I
&gt;think the manufacturer was Kats, not sure.   Cost was $32 so I didn't want

Guess that one has to fit the sump plate to be effective, the only part on
the engine block that the magnet can attach to. Here in north Europe we use
a sump plate with a built in electric resistor, about 150 Watts. Heats the
oil enough when it has been plugged in for a few hours in the morning.
Bought mine a few years ago, so it could still be awailable. The brand was
&quot;Defa&quot; or possibly &quot;Calix&quot;. Theese are 230 Volt units.
A really handy person could probably put something together from a sump
plate and a block heater for a w***r cooled engine.
In some old magazines I've seen a device that fitted the ribs in the engine
block bottom. Never seen one of those live.

My neighbour had an exellent emergency unit: A bread toaster, the really
old kind without timer. He put it under his bug, went inside and took an
extra cup of morning coffe while the engine was heated. Worked suprisingly
well!

Guess a 500Watts Halogen work light could help too. At least it would
illuminate your problem:-)

On your frozen accelerator wire problem: Also check under the pedal, snow
under your shoe melts and drops down on the &quot;hinge&quot; where your pedal is
attached to the floor. Dry this up and grease.
