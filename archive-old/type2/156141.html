Subject: Re: [T2] Cam Question

Karl, the engine that I just pulled apart two weeks
ago had the same problem and the #1 would not adjust
on the intake valve, the # 3 was just fine but the #1
intake lifter and half of the cam had 1/4 of a inch
worn off the lifter and one side(1/2)of the lobe on
the cam was gone. I can only go by what I see and what
I seen was the intake lifter gone, worn off 1/4
inch(intake lifter would not pull out of the case), on
the intake valve side if the cam, half of the intake
lobe on the cam was worn off. Phil
