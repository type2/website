 Dear listees,=20
I am considering going to a dual carb setup on my
70' Kombi (1600 dp, Webber progressive, extractor header).
=20
 The choices seem to be.
1. Empi Brosal
2. Kadron (Solex?)
3 Webber 34mm ICT
How do all of these rate as far as tuneability,
reliability, and performance?
 Also, will I at some point be able to retune these same carbs
to run on an 1835cc motor, or would that really require some=20
dual throat carbs.
 Will I need to go to an electric fuel pump?
 Finally, where is the best place to buy this setup?

T.I.A. Jack =20
