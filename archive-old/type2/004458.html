Subject: Todd Norman

Hello folks,

 Now that the list is up again, I have to report some sad news.

 Many of you may remember posts to the list from Todd Norman and he is on
the A.I.R.S. list as a contact. For those of you who don't know, Todd
contracted cancer while in Washington State and was medically retired from
the Navy. He brought his family down here to OKC to be near his wife's
relatives.

 Last Sunday, I went over to visit him since I haven't heard from him in a
couple of weeks. I found out then that Todd has slipped into a coma, and
probably will not make it to the end of the week. I was shocked but not
surprised, and had a very good talk with his mother in law.
His wife, Laurie, was in the room with Todd, so I didn't get to talk with
her.

 I will keep everyone informed and if you wish to send e-mail, his address
is: tnorman2000_at_earthlink_dot_net
