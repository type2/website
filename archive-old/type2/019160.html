Subject: Heater Blower Motor - '76
Message-ID: &lt;38276E22.73C0D5B5_at_teleport_dot_com&gt;

Howdy - Are there any Listees out there who have replaced the blower
motor on their '76? I've detemined that the relay for the motor works
and 12 V is present on the motor wires, but it doesn't turn. If I nudge
the blower fan (with a tool - lots of torque here!), it will turn over
for a few revs and stop again. The blower cage has VW/Audi p/n 261 261
193A, AEG L76A2570365, but I can't identify a separate number for the
motor.

Any help appreciated - chilly mornings, etc.

Thank you,

Ron Johnson
