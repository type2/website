Subject: '85 Vanagon Transaxle for sale

I have a '85 transaxle out of a donor van. I'm
putting the waterboxer in a Baja I'm building
for my son. It will be his first car, at lot
cooler than mine, a '60 Comet, 6 cylinder auto
at that. Well, I digress....

I will take any reasonable offer, plus shipping
(I'm in S.W. Michigan) of course. It is in very
good mechanical condition. I would use it in the
Baja but it's a side shifter.

Terry
