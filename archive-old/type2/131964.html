Subject: Re: [T2] Auto Trans question / and Rust

Hi Ed,

&gt; 1.) How available are the automatic transmissions to fit these
&gt; models/years? If I get a manual transmission, and
&gt; want to convert it, will I be able to find an automatic trans and about
&gt; how much will it cost me ?

Auto transmissions are not uncommon. Converting a standard bus to an 
auto tranny is a very complicated task which would require extensive 
modification of the vehicle. In essense, you would need an entire donor 
bus to work with.  If what you want is an auto transmission it's best 
to find an auto-tranny bus to start with.

&gt;
&gt; 2.) This may be an old thread for list members, but maybe someone can
&gt; give me the &quot;master list&quot; of usual rust spots on these models (77-79) 
&gt; so
&gt; I can be prepared when looking at the vehicles.
&gt;

Under the windsheild, under the floorboards, and the vent-wing windows. 
The rockers and dog-legs are common as well. None of those are as hard 
to deal with as rust in the sliding door track or front suspension 
beam. There is more info on rust detection and treatment in the library 
at www.type2_dot_com.

Happy trails,
