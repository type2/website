Subject: Re: [T2] Been thinking of moving myself

&gt;&gt;After 6 inches of snow on April 20th and a about a foot or so on April
Fool's Day I was just thinking about moving to the Carolinas.&lt;&lt;

wait until mid-August when it's 100+ degrees outside &amp; the humidity makes
every pore sweat as soon as you step foot outside, even at 8 a.m.

you might be wishing for all that snow again!

but of course we would still welcome any busses/bus drivers to the area.
