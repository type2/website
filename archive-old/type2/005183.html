I got the motor in the bus today it is now running and I drove it for the
first time this was an exciting day!!!!

but I think I need to play with the timing a little  just to get it running
smoother.

This was so much fun and it cost me a lot too but it is all worth  it ..

My bus now has a License and insurance the last time it was on the road was
in 1995.

NormaGene was asking me to take her out on the open road but she still needs
some work.
