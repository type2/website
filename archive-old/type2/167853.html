Subject: Re: [T2] Metal wall behind front seats

FWIW, my 1979  Kombi  has  the  metal walls behind both seats, passenger
seat has the two position adjustment with the clip on the back to attach it
to the metal wall.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; A have had 2 friends with '76 busses and both busses had metal walls
&gt; behind the front seats.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My 79 does not have these.
&gt; Reading through the &quot;Model and Year Variations&quot; document in the
&gt; type2_dot_com library I see that these were removed in model year 1977.
&gt; I assume this was to allow the seats to recline.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot,
&gt; Zack
