Subject: Gas Heater part needed..

Howdy All,
I am in need of a part which I am afraid may be a bit hard to find. The part is for an Eberpacher B2 gas heater (yes, B2 NOT BN2) I need the valve\jet thingy (sorry for the technical term) that sprays the fuel into the combustion chamber this part also has the valve for the surplus return fuel line.
I can give you cash for this part or I will trade you a COMPLETE 6volt Southwind gas heater for it, if you pay half of th eshipping on the SW. I think the SW heater was pulled from a Karman Ghia, although I honestly don't know. The SW heater I have to trade appears to work fine. I applied  6 volts and both fans started running and the spark plug sparked, however, when I tried to test it the gas line sprung a leak before it fired up, so I turned it off fast! Let me know if you got what I need, and need what I got!


Peace, John Baker
