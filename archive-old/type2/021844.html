Subject: Re: [T2] Fan removal

I applied some heat to the hub tonight and the fan came right off. I  used a
small plumbers torch and went in circles around the hub area. It wiggled off
and then I felt how hot everything got. The fan was only warm on the back
side and little where I put the flame. I only put the torch on it for a minute.
Worked well. Thanks Art and the rest of
you for the suggestions. Now to get the oil cooler off and replace the seals.

&gt;    For what it's worth, here's my experience. Was doing the same thing.
&gt; Removed the three bolts, tapped it with rubber hammer. No go. Applied
&gt; penetrating oil. Tried again. No go. Attached a three armed gear puller,
&gt; tightened it up to a frightening level. No go. Left it on overnight. No go.
&gt; Applied physics, heated up the hub with a pencil torch going round and
&gt; round to avoid too much heat and then, BANG, the hub, gear puller and the
&gt; end of the pencil torch flew a good ten feet. Hub off.
&gt;    Try it, but stand to the side and wear goggles.

&gt; &gt; Wanted to ask some advice. I am trying to get the fan on my 78 Westy. I
&gt; &gt; removed the three bolts and have given
&gt; &gt; it a few hard tugs. I though about giving it a few smacks with the
&gt; &gt; rubber mallet, but don't know how easy it is
&gt; &gt; to damage the crank seal or fan. I tried the usual oil and break away
&gt; &gt; spary. No luck yet. I need to get the fan housing off to replace the
&gt; &gt; seals on the oil cooler. Ideas anyone? Thanks
