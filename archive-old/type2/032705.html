Subject: Re: Engine question - '76 bus

If I were you I'd do a compression check on the rebuilt engine in the orange 
bus and the one in the green bus and use the best one. If the rebuilt one 
really only has 11,000 miles on it and the compression is good use it with 
the best tranny you have. Transfer everything you like and want to the 
orange bus and if you have room, store the green one and use it for a parts 
bus.  In the mean time you can rebuild the original engine out of the green 
one and have it on hand in case anything happens to your driver.  There is 
no difference between those two engines.

If you can't keep the old bus for parts at least make sure you keep the 
engine and ALL the fuel injection parts.  They are EXPENSIVE. Don't forget 
the fuel pump under there, they cost a lot of money too and it should be 
saved if it still works.

that's my advice anyway.
