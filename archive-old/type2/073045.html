&gt;I am reading the archives, trying to determine where to time (with a
&gt;timing light), my 1600dp engine. I have an 009 dizzy

I was playing with the Faq-O-Matic, courtesy of Brother Hintz, which isn't
linked to the home page yet because I forgot:

And I was looking at the Distributors section, which is cloned from the
type2 Library:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/fom-serve/cache/44.html

So I added &quot;Timing the Bosch 009&quot;, you'll see it at the bottom. However, it
turns out that the FOM removes all redundant white space her HTML specs, so
it looks awful. Here it is again corrected:


Somehow this never made it into the Library but it has been the subject
of about a thousand list messages. The thing about timing is that what
matters most is what happens at cruising speed, maximum advance--that's
where you can burn up an engine quickly if your timing is too far advanced.

But: The Bosch 009 does not have a predictable advance curve--the German
ones are different from the Brazilian ones and the worn ones are different
from the new ones and on it goes. The natural result of this is that just
because you've timed the 009 properly at idle does not mean you have any
way of knowing what's going on at highway speeds.

So while the stock vacuum advance distributors can safely be timed at idle
(or even timed statically per Muir, although this is never optimal), the
009 has GOT to be timed to about 30 degrees TOTAL ADVANCE with a timing
light. Which means you have to rev it up until the distributor stops
advancing before you can dial it in.

It takes three hands and if the process isn't painful, you aren't doing it
right. =^ ) It's okay to time it statically at around zero degrees in order
to get the engine started, but you have to finish the process dynamically
by making lotsa noise.

It is very easy to find 30 degrees without a degree wheel as long as you
know where top dead center is. From TDC, measure an inch and three quarters
(1 3/4&quot;) to the right around the diameter of a stock pulley. That's about
28 degrees, go a tinch further and mark it with fingernail polish or
something.

If you don't know where TDC is, then you have to pull the #1 spark plug
and push the eraser end of a pencil in the hole and rotate the engine and
feel the piston until you figure it out.

A basic timing gun is ~$20, get one and carry it with you, it's an
irreplacable tool.
