Can anyone fill me in on my airconditioning? This has a large compressor? on
the drivers side of the engine compartment when you open the rear lid, and a
complex vent system attached under the main dash up front. There are 6 (I
believe) adjustable vents on this system with a min/off/max knob on the left
side, and a temp? knob to the right. It does not appear to be working, but
blows lots of air. :-) I didn't notice a belt to the compressor, how does
this thing work?
Thanks
Courtney
