It's easy and cheap enough to replace wheel cylinders as and when they go.
If the others are OK, I'd leave them alone. Just get the drums off and see
it the seals are ok and they're not leaking and that they move in and out
and don't stick. There may be some advantage in buying 4 at once if you go
mail order and there's a relatively big delivery charge.

For me in UK, the delivery typically comes out at 8-10 UKP per parcel, and a
wheel cylinder costs about this, so I'd make sure I was buying something
else at the same time.
