Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westfalia

Hi Greg,

Given your message mentions 'freeway' I guess that you live in the USA, where for the 1978 model year VW did not import 1600cc busses.
So if your bus is not a grey import then it would originaly have had a 2000cc engine and a different gear box from a 1600cc engined bus of the same year.
The gearbox for a 2000cc engine actualy needs the engine to run faster - for a given speed in 4th gear - than the gearbox for a 1600 engine. So not only are you trying to drive the bus fairly quickly for a 1600 (all-be-it upgraded to 1645) but the engine is going even faster because of the gearbox.

Thats why you are getting the high temps - but what can you do to reduce them.

If you could find a 1600 van gearbox and swap over that would help as it would reduce engine revs per distance.

If you were to fit larger diameter tyres you would reduce the engine revs required for a given speed but the speedo would read low, and you would get reduced acceleration along with reduced hill climbing abilitity and harder pull aways. There is TONS of information in the list archive on the largest tyre size that will fit and what makes are good.

To get a type1 engine to push a bus along at 70mph is quite possible - VW do it with the current production 1600 engine from Mexico fitted with FI and an output of 64HP. When I had my current bus first, and before realising the power of this engine, I did take it up to 85mph before noticing the speedo and backing off without reaching top speed. How ever I'm sure I would have quickly killed my bone stock engine had I done that all day.

I know of others who have had specialy built type 1 engines that will push their bus along a 80mph towing a caravan without over heating and do this all day without wreking the engine.

Indeed if you read the VW magazines they regularly featured Beetles with type 1 engine right through to 2300cc. But none of the articles give a mean time between rebuild for these engines. Meny of these cars are for drag racing and the engines are only run for a few minuets at a time, not for several hours at a time on the freeway. 

So by machining the crankcase fitting oversive barrels and pistons, combined with a new cam it is possible to build a type 1 engine to do what you want; but it will generate a lot more heat than a standard engine.
Now you are into fitting external oil coolers.

In short its 'easy' to buy the power parts to build your monster engine but difficult to but hem together into a long lasting (50000mile) engine; and its not cheep either.

Given that your bus is likely to have the 2000cc gearing than it could well be cheeper and easier to build a reliable stock 2000cc (carb or FI) than to build a 'monster' type 1 engine.

Good luck

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt;  I recently purchased a 78' Westfalia.  The prior owner installed an
&gt; upright type 1, 1640cc (something like 1644cc or 1646? I don't remember)
&gt; dual port, single carb engine.  The other day I had it out on the
&gt; freeway for the first time and it quickly started heating up (closing in
&gt; on 250 degrees at freeway speeds).  It seems better if I drop it down to
&gt; around 55 mph.  Here is my question.  What kind of type 1 motor could I
&gt; build that would adequately push this Westy along at 70 mph?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Greg
