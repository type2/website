Subject: steering column

73 Westy
Does anyone know where I can find a diagram, photos, parts list, whatever, of the top part of the steering column?  Directly underneath the wheel, inside column.
My column is loose at the top and I have a suspicion I'm missing a bushing, bearing, or something directly underneath the wheel and spring.  Haynes and BustedBus show a little detail, but no parts info.  I need to identify the missing part/s.
Help my bus steer steady! Thanks.
