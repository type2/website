&gt; Waaay back when I drove / owned a bunch of early Chevy and Ford van's
&gt; ( Dodge had one too ) that was similar to the Bus / Vanagon
&gt; configuration ( except the engine was in between the front seats  not in
&gt; the rear) ,and I drove the heck outa them till they all died.
&gt;
&gt;
I had the Dodge version (&quot;rocking horse&quot;) and in the rain/light snow the
thing had maybe the worst handling I've ever experienced... ;-(
