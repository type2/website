Dale:

It sounds like you may have splashed though a big puddle before parking
your Bus and applying the hand brake.  The damp shoes will sometimes stick
to the warm drums after they cool down.

To break them loose, simply bring up the rpms slightly, put it in reverse
and let out the clutch.  Be careful not to rev too high or you could be in
for a wild ride.

This is not an unusual problem.

Thank you!

 Hi all,
 
 Trish tried to back our 72 westy out of the garage this morning and
couldn't budge
 her.  It felt like the emergency brake wasn't releasing, but from the
outside, it
 looked like the back right wheel was the problem--like everything would go
if it was
 released!!
 
 Any ideas on first steps in dealing with this would be greatly
appreciated.
