&gt; BTW, I also have a pointer style torque wrench from Sears, made in

I have two recurring nightmares about engine-building. One is that I 
somehow install the distributor pinion wrong, discover my mistake when 
the engine is back in the base, pull the pinion and the washer drops 
into the case.

The other is overtorquing that 9 ft/lb nut in the sump plate. There's 
no way that I can read 9 ft/lb accurately enough with a pointer style 
torque wrench. Maybe it's my eyesight.
