The color of your exhaust hasn't anything to do with your exhaust 
pipes. Sounds like you are running rich.

&gt;  i am thinking they don't make new exhaust parts for the 76 bus 
&gt; anymore and i would have to buy them used from a junkyard. I did that 
&gt; ince and i don't want to do that again is there a more effective way 
&gt; of replacing my exhaust sytem so i don't have to go through it again 
&gt; aby information would  be more than grateful

Since the pipes aren't your current problem, you should make a point of 
replacing your exhaust at a leisurely pace. The only parts that you 
cannot get new are the headers and the crosspipe. These can usually be 
repaired by a competent welder. The rest are all available aftermarket.
