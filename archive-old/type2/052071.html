VW would be better off (IMO) if they would take this approach!
The best advertising is enthusiastic followers; why they hold em' back is
beyond me.

&gt; &gt; It's crazy that they are going after guys that are supporting the VW
hobby,
&gt; &gt; yet they not doing this to eliminate competition in a market that they
are
&gt; &gt; competing in, or willing to START competing in. They are simply doing it
to
&gt; &gt; be vindictive and &quot;protect&quot; their copyright.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would have no problem with their actions if they were actually
supporting
&gt; &gt; us, but they don't give a damn.

&gt; I fear you're right that they don't give a damn. VWof America, that is. I
get
&gt; really good parts service and a lot of help from the guys and gals at my
local
&gt; dealer. They sometimes even come out and check out my vehicle when I'm
driving
&gt; the double cab.
&gt; Other brands have taken a lot more proactive stance on licensing repro
parts and
&gt; trademark items.
&gt; Two I'm familiar with are Corvette (GM) and Porsche.
&gt; They have both worked with many manufacturers to enable them to get their
&gt; products to market yet retain the marques ownership of the trademarks. I
believe
&gt; they do this by making licenses relatively inexpensive.
&gt; In the case of Porsche they have actively solicited companies to re-tool
and
&gt; build some parts that were in high demand and then marketed them through
their
&gt; own system. Both these companies take the view that enthusiasts can be
their
&gt; best salesmen and often customers for the new vehicles.
&gt; Sadly, this has not happened with VW of America.
