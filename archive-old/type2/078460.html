Subject: cheap bus wanted in SE

hello all,
 I am looking for a cheap bus in the south east ,any year. , I would prefer
it to be drivable but not necessary , I would buy one without a motor as
long as I could put my 1600 motor in it. I would like it to be cheap as
possible in the Carolinas , Georgia or VA. Of course I am not expecting a
rust free bus , I just want a beater or something with potential.
Thanks in advance
-------Bryan
