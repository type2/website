&lt;&lt; Tony,

You would point that out wouldn't you&lt;grin&gt;....it didn't say...I am hoping 
that it is the standard 400 degrees and it finishes when you actually have 
it on the car getting hotter...sort of like the por-15 header stuff..

Cheers, dave

Buddy of mine was foolin' around with the Eastwood DIY stuff and had 
mixed results...Mostly it depended on how scrupulously clean you got
the object before powder coating it. His other tip was to call the local
thrift/used appliance stores in the area and buy an electric range...
He got one really cheap, i.e. free, 'cause it 'only' needed the top burn-
ers...Also SWMBO (She Who Must Be Obeyed- H. Rider Haggard) or
YSO (Your Significant Other), would really prefer you to not use the
family range... ;-(
