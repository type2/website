Subject: side marker lights
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 72 bus that I just got about a week ago.  I really don't know too 
much about them yet and I have some questions which are probably really easy. 
 I just can't figure them out.  Well, first is the side marker lights they 
don't work.  Th e bulbs look brand new in them.  There is two wires inside, 
one looks like it goes to the parking lights and the other wire doesn't go to 
anything.  I tried grounding this wire and It didn't do anything.   Please 
help.   Also I smell gas fumes in the bus.  I know this is coming from the 
heating system but If someone could tell me where a commmon place to look for 
this problem would be.   Thank You
