I am tuning a 72 700 with an 050 Distributor and Weber 228 carbs. The carbs
are balanced and set out at 1 3/4 turns. The timing is set at 7.5 BTDC and
the idle is hunting around 900 rpm.

I am sure the linkage is set properly as the throttle arms at the carb move
at exactly the same time when the accelerator is moved slightly.

At 1000 rpm there is no hunting. Dwell is at 44, but I'm not sure how to
adjust this. Is this a matter of adjusting points? I adjusted the points per
spec. I am used to a pointless ignition, so dwell is something new to me.

Any thoughts on this. I ran some carb cleaner through the carbs and WD 40'd
the linkage balls. 

If I blip the linkage it tac's up, but backfires (slightly) on the way back
down. It was backfiring slightly just of Idle on the way up, but
adjusting/cleaning the carbs seems to have solved this.

What should be the total advance for this carb? 29 Degrees at 3500?

TIA

Matt
