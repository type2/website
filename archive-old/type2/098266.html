&gt; Ok I have a set of 50 foot extension wires that I have to use

let's call these wires 50' resistance wires.

&gt; Lets say I have the welder set at 200 amps--at the end of them 50 ft.
&gt; cables at the work--I am really welding at about 150 amps.( welding work
&gt; is done via amps not volts)

We cannot seperate volts &amp; amps in regard to work. Consider the
forumla P=EI, where P=power in watts, E=force in volts, &amp; I-current in
amps. If you cut either you will have less power. Welding is done by
both. What I believe you meant to say is you adjust just how powerful
your arc is by adjusting a knob on the welder that effects it. This
knob isn't directly adjusting the current. It's adjusting the amount
of resistance in the circuit. You can see the relation of resistance
to current in the equation I=E/R, where the more resistance in the
circuit will decrease the current.

&gt; There is a loss of amperage at length--I measured it. ( unless you
&gt; double the size of the wire or increase the power supply)

Well, this statement is sorta correct. Because of the voltage drop
from a longer cord (read higher resistance) there is less force to
push the electrons. Hence less current. Current won't just decide to
go or not go anywhere. In fact it doesn't like to to jack. It's the
voltage difference that causes current flow. BTW how did you measure
the current? those meters which will measure current above the 10 amp
range are purty darn expensive.

&gt; The greater the distance the bigger the wire must be, or you lose
&gt; amperage at the other end ( and in correct circumstances  voltage )  

Yes larger diameter wires will decrease the resistance of a wire
per foot. &quot;in correct circumstances&quot;? ALWAYS voltage. which will
reduce current. Plus if on the welder you are talking about the
difference between the dial setting you set &amp; what the welders analog
gage &quot;measured&quot; then most likely the knob was designed for a
particular length power cord &amp; voltage. Be introducing the extra 50'
of cord you have lowered the voltage at the unit.
