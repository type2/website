John &amp; Topher &amp; Friends,

I found a link somewhere to &quot;Helios the Heron&quot; and included it on the
BusNames page, but if anybody knows of a URL to a better set of pics, please
let me know. The URL I have only shows one angle of the bus.

Thanks -

&gt; I had a conversation tonight with Topher Waring, of Riverside School,
&gt; Lyndonville, VT 05851 tonight.  He's a shop teacher who yearly
disassembles
&gt; and rebuilds an all electric 71 Westy with his middle school kids to run
in
&gt; the NorthEast Sustainable Energy Association American Tour de Sol
&gt;
(http://www.ipd.anl_dot_gov/ttrdc/research/student_competitions/tour_de_sol/amer
