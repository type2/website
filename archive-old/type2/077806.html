Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions parts vs. non-Emissions


&gt; I have a '78 camper and was wondering what was added to California models
&gt; for emissions control.  I've seen a part for a catalytic converter and I've
&gt; heard that the gas tank is different.
&gt;
&gt; Two questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Can the converter be bolted onto the non-emissions exhaust?

Yes, it takes the place of the straight pipe between the U pipe and the muffler.
Ron at Bus Depot has a drawing of it:

You should have #5. The cat takes it's place.

&gt; 2) What's different about the gas tank?

The filler neck has a 'fillpipe restricter' built into it so you can only use a
smaller unleaded nozzle.
