Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

My fellow scientist &amp; teacher Geo rightly points out re 'eddy cruise':
&gt;
&gt;Cruising flat-out (63 mph if I
&gt;  &gt; recall correctly), let a big square-ended truck pass you by a small
&gt;&gt;  margin, and nip in right behind his rear end.  The large eddy zone
&gt;&gt;  sucks you along  -  you ease off your fuel, and cruise at 70 !
&gt;
&gt;Just fine until a road alligator or other debris pops out from under that
&gt;Semi!  Or the Semi blows a tire.  Or the driver spits his chew out the
&gt;widow...  :)
&gt;
&gt;Then it's Scary Time!

	- and may breach EPA or local pollution limits.  This would 
not, however, be a statistically significant addition to the death 
rate for that state.

	Yes, I suspect semis give stronger rear vortices than '2 axle' trucks.
	 Must I spell out that the list of potential catastrophes is 
longer than Geo's shrewd suggestions, and I haven't done this 
'drafting' for 3 decades.  Indeed I developed a morbid interest in 
LPG fireballs, nuclear reactors, gene-tampering and other menacing 
technologies.
	The reminder these 'eddy cruise' experiences gave me is that 
drag at rear is a main parasite of cruise power.  The effective 
addition to my hp at the rear wheels could be guesstimated  ... I 
guesstimate my 36 bhp 1200cc splittie was producing, around 1/3 
throttle, only 10 bhp; but I was doing a speed normally requiring, 
say, a 50 bhp1600cc motor to propel that splittie to 70 mph.  The 
truck was thus dissipating c.40 hp in this eddy.  Take it away teach!
	If one knows the driver of the truck it could possibly be 
justified for some distance.  Shall we write the script for Mel 
Gibson's 'Roadwarrior 3 - the Final Economy Run'?  I was able to ease 
off to half throttle or less in this 'eddy cruise' mode, while moving 
well in excess of splittie max speed.  Duane Eddy could be a good 
soundtrack.  But no, don't do it.
