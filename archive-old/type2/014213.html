Subject: Engine advice needed

I am looking for any info anyone has on either AVP
engines in Sacramento CA regarding 2000cc , or Boston
Bobs for the same thing. Anyone out there have any
experience with these??
I am looking for a rebuild for my 2000 FI and don't
know where to turn...
Any other recommendations on a rebuilder for a 2000cc
engine?

Thanks in advance
Chuck Notmeyer
Reno  NV
