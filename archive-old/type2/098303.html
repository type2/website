Subject: Accelerator cable and FI ??? 

Hello List,

Recently, I have been working to get my engine
compartment ready for my rebuilt 914 that I am almost
ready to install. This week, I have welded in a new
battery trey and corner on the passanger's side. I
pulled the gas tank and painted the gas tank cover
plate grey. I ordered some POR 15 semigloss black
paint, some Whitecote POR 15 and some of their putty.
I plan to use the putty to seal all of the welded
seams in the engine compartment. Next, I will spray
the engine compartment with the black and then use the
whitecote as a finial  coat. I also bought the gas
tank repair kit that they sell so I can seal the gas
tank before reinstalling it.

Accelerator Cable Question......

My bus is a 74 w/automatic tranny. Will the stock
accelerator cable work with the FI 2L that I am
installing in the bus? I have the FI tranny mount that
has the accelerator cable hole in the correct spot. I
just need to know if this cable will work. By
accident, I bought an accelerator cable for a 76-79
automatic bus which is used with an operating lever
and accelerator linkage, neither of which an automatic
74 bus has. What is my best choice of action? Do I
need to get the operating lever and linkage or will
the 74 cable work with out it? comments? suggestions?

Thanks in advance for any responses!

Have a great day!

David Kelly
