Subject: [T2] Shuddering problems...
&gt;
&gt;So, I just got the bus out of the shop out of 4 months worth of work (body
&gt;and engine). I've run it for 2 days (less than 4 half hour drives) and it
&gt;has run like an absolute dream.  Until yesterday. About 45 minutes into
&gt;the drive home it starts shuddering. It does it mainly if I have the gas
&gt;pedal down a ways. If I push it to the floor, it gets worse. If i let up
&gt;on the gas, it stopped for a bit but eventually started up again. These
&gt;were pretty good shakes too. Lurches more like.
&gt;
&gt;I let it sit for 45 minutes with the lid open. It starts up fine. I drive the 2 miles
&gt;home with no problems what so ever. Start it up this morning. It idles fine.
&gt;
&gt;Here is what got done during the 4 months (after the thing sat for 4
&gt;years). New ECU, New AFM, New Gas tank, New Axle Beam, tune up, timing,
&gt;oil change, new injectors, new fuel lines, new hoses.
&gt;
&gt;It's a late 77 bus with a 78 engine. I'm thinking the obviously missing
&gt;duct work (duh) and a new fuel filter might fix it. Any other things I
&gt;should investigate? Electrical maybe?

This is a typical fuel injection problem that is repaired best by folowing
the Bentley procedures. The answer may be fuel supply ( plugged filter, rust in tank )
which will display incorrect fuel pressure or delivery.
It can also be an ECU input signal ( from AFM, Temp Sensor 2, etc.)
You may guess and get lucky, but the Bentley is the preferred method.

As regards the ECU input from the AFM, this is also common to Vanagon,
where the &quot;fix&quot; was a factory patch cable ( for which a cheap solution is
a  capacitor in series with contacts in the AFM ). This has produced
successful repair in 2.1L Vanagon engines, with some evidence of success
in 1.9L engines as well. Evidently, the ECU goes into default under certain conditions,
caused by a resonance in the AFM signal. These are L-jetronic w/ Lambda engines.
Has anyone attempted a similar repair for earlier AFM problems ?
