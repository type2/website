Subject: dynamat alternative

Chris,

Tried to p-mail you several times, but got rejected by your server.
I reread your post on the roofing tar-like material that you substituted
for dynamat.


I am ready to &quot;dynomat&quot; my 78 champagne edition.

Went back and read your post on the roofing tar type stuff...

How has it worked out???
Still on ok after the summer?...Did it drip and run&lt;grin&gt;.

Still quiet?  

Did it ever smell bad???

Local quote of about $5.00/sq ft for Dynamat(fleet prices)....still too 
high for me.

Anyone else have an reasonable alternatives?  Tried to find the part
number that you posted for the stuff at mcmelectronics with no luck.


Cheers ,dave
