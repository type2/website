Subject: Tow bars and 72 buses

Hi Kevin,
          Looking at the pictures, I think the towbar would work with my 69 Bay 
and from memory of my 71... I think there is a good chance it would work with 
yours.  You may have to remove (a) the grease nipples and (b) the steering 
stabilizer (shock) as well as (c) the anti-sway bar.  I say that because my own 
towbar looks pretty similar and I have to remove a-b-c to make it fit 
correctly.  Also probably the belly-pan under the front floor.  Too bad Alaska 
is not closer to Maryland, OTW you could borrow my towbar...  Glenn

Subject: Tow bars and 72 buses

I'm looking for a way to tow my 72 bus and was looking at a tow bar made by 
jeremyrockjock listed on TheSamba.

  http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=272543

Searching through the archives I found the note down below indicating that 
it may not work on a 72.

Any opinions to this or on the tow bar made by jeremyrockjock?
