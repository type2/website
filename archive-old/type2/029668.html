Volks,

A truly amazing bit of trivia is that if you look under the sink in your
hotel room in Paris, home of the metric system, the drain pipe will be an
inch-sized pipe!  For whatever reason, plumbing is one of those fields
where inate conservatism has overcome reason.  The drains on Westies are
inch-sized fittings and you should be able to head down to any plumbing
supply house and pick up replacement parts, in both the US and in Europe.
I don't know if this is true in OZ, but I would be willing to bet a beer
that it is :-)
