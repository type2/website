Subject: Alternator problems again?

I put a rebuilt alternator in my bus about 4 months ago.  On the way home
today the alternator/battery/charging light suddenly came on and stayed
on.  Actually, it flickered a little (twice-three times) before staying
permanently on.

I know that it is not recomended to pull the negative battery cable while
the bus is running, but it seemed hand loose so I couldn't resist the
temptation.  Of course that shut the bus down.

That leads me to belive the alternator has gone bad because if I would
have pulled the cable and the bus continued to run, then the alternator
would have kept supplying 12 volt to the coil in order to provide spark to
keep it going. If the battery was good and the alt bad, then of course I
could drive as long as the battery held out.

Am I in the right ballpark?

The bus is a 74 with a 2 liter type 4

Thanks!
