X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&gt; In the interest of not getting smacked for hawking a few VW parts, where do
&gt; I go to post such type 2 things?

Brian
besides your typical ebay and traderonline, good vw specific sites that
have a list connection are www.type2_dot_com buy/sell, thesamba_dot_com
classifieds and vintagebus_dot_com auction site. It is also acceptable to post
items for sale to the lists, especially nice if offered before posted to
public sites.
ebay posts are not allowed on the type2 list due to past incidences.
