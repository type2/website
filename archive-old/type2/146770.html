Subject: Re: [T2] CHT gauge- was Tach-&gt; Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

Having thought that VDO CHT gauge was very inaccurate myself, I have 
been pleasantly surprised.  When I'm driving on the freeway, whether hot 
or cold, it has consistantly read at 350 degrees.  If I start going up a 
hill it gets hotter (up to 410ish), down a hill it obviously drops. 
However, my engine has finally broken in and 350 is where it hangs out 
in hot or cold weather...

thanks,
Mike

&gt; &lt;I'm curious, why do most listees rag so badly on the VDO gauges?&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Because (in the case of the Head Temp) as I understand it the head
&gt; temp could read +/- the outside temps. Your engine could be
&gt; overheating but because the outside temps (cab temps) are so low, it
&gt; would no show up on the dash. Needs ambient temp compensation added
&gt; as I understand. ANYONE please correct me. I'd love to better
