&gt; Which way should air be able to travel?  Should I be able to blow air to or

&gt; motor that says &quot;motor&quot; and that is the way I have it installed.  I tested
&gt; it myself before installation.  Ahhhhhhh.

Air should travel freely toward the engine, and should be blocked from
going the other way.
