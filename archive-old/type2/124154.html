Subject: AIRS Update - Need Diagnosis

Hi,
The transmission was switched with a working one, engine back in. Engine ran
okay before the switch. After the switch we do a tune up. Engine is
a 1978 2 liter rebuild with hydraulic lifters with about 20k on it. Carbs as
best we can tell, are Weber 2X44 or 2X40 IDF performance carbs with a
linkage
bar which connects them to the accel cable. These webers do not have the
provision for a vacuum advance distributor, so an 009 was installed, and
worked for the trip from high altitude Colorado, where the bus was
purchased, to sea level Bay Area where it is now.

I had them buy all the bosch tune up parts from The Bug Stop in Martinez. He
told them to look for 10 degrees advance at idle and no more than about 28
total advance. I remember using 009s with 34/3 on pre-71 buses and timing it
to about 7.5 at idle and no more than 28TA, so sounded good to me. I
rechecked his work and we made sure the plug gaps and point gaps were dead
on, found tdc for #1 by watching #3 for cycle. Made a new paint mark, noted
position of rotor, moved notch in lip of distributor to match, made sure #1
wire came off that, tightened it all down and set the timing - sounded best
around 8 degrees btdc at idle, with no more than 28 TA.

The problem: No power in any of the forward gears when encountering even the
slightest hill. Another thing I noticed is you could drive to like 20 or
more in 1st gear, all the gearing seemed super high. We get in for the test
ride and take it out of the farm down a very steep dirt driveway and out of
the woods to the main road. I'm driving and it shifts like butter through 1
and 2 but with much more than the definite classic 009 dead spot but if you
drive REALLY fast, you can keep it running. hmmm. we get out on the main
road and I try to take it back up a gentle sloping hill and it has zero
power. Way worse than any 009 dead spot I've felt. Here you ride the clutch
and compensate and give it a lot of gas and there's nothing there, it won't
push the bus at all. The only way we were able to get back up the driveway
was in reverse gear. In reverse gear it works fine - the gas pedal floored
spins the wheels and gets it up the steep hill okay..

Other factors: Vacuum line from Servo to Weber manifold is original and has
a pretty good kink in it at the manifold. I had them put a hose clamp on it
but I suspect there's probably a leak there as it's running hot.  The accel
cable is broken just after it comes through the engine firewall. Another
cable is matched against it and they are held together by a barrel nut -
seems to work okay but I had them buy a new one which they have on hand -
I'm not sure that this is contributing to their power problem. The fuel pump
appears to be working fine with a fuel filter full of fuel.

I'm looking for feedback on the source of total absence of power in the low
end of gears 1,2 &amp; 3, but plenty of power in reverse. I don't have any
experience with Weber Performance carbs, but I suspect we're doing something
wrong ie timing/carb adjustment. Any feedback appreciated - Thanks.
