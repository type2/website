Dave,
I gotta say that that was the most comprehensive, concise and helpful reponse
i have seen on this thread. you have just answered -all- of my (and probably
most other 'dizzy' posters) current dizzy questions.  You _are_ the man. 
Thanx.

&gt; a dual vacuum dizzy.  Quick description for those who need it:
