Subject: Re: [T2] Hot Starting problem; Breakerless Ignition

Bob,

After searching through the archives, mine is more of
a warm start problem.  The starter works just fine,
but the engine acts like not enough fuel is getting to
it. What I am thinking, based on the archives, is that
the engine is still warm, so no cold start valve via
thermo time switch, so it relies on pressure in the
fuel rail for gas to be there.  There may be a leak in
the regulator and not enough pressure is there, sooo,
no extra fuel is present to get her going, unless I
hold down the starter. When cold, it is cold enough
for the cold start valve to put some more gas in,
hence the fine running condition then.  

Any other ideas?

Any ideas?  Ami I in the right place?

Thanks,

Mark

&gt; &gt; Problem with starting after the engine has only

&gt; &gt; off for a minute or so.  I remember this being
&gt; 
&gt; I phutzed with this problem for years and finally
&gt; threw in the towel and
&gt; put a relay in, have not had any problems since
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am also contemplating going to a breakerless
&gt; &gt; ignition, something along the lines of a petronix
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; stock though.  Anybody use a breakerless module
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; would like to comment?  Also, I have perused the
&gt; 'net
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Pertronix in my 78 and have had it for a
&gt; couple years now, I like
&gt; it.
