Subject: [T2]Vanagon  Seats on a spinner in a Late Bay

As I said before, I have had vanagon seats in my bus for years....

I just got a &quot;spinner&quot; last weekend..

Is this just a bolt in application???
Should I use &quot;grade 8&quot; bolts???
Do I need to &quot;cut out&quot; the stock rails????

Will I have &quot;full spin&quot; ( 360 deg) ?????

Thanks
