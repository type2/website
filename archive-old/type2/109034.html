Subject: Re: [T2] E-brake Lever Pins

You are still sane. Rocky Mountain Motorworks has these parts. Here is the
link http://motorworks_dot_com/search2_description.asp?ITEMNO=211%20609%20601B

The part number for the anchor pin is 211 609 601b
The horseshoe clip is part number 211 609 619

Do a part number search on Bus Depot. They have them also.
pin-$2.29
clip-$0.25

Subject: [T2] E-brake Lever Pins


&gt; Friends,
&gt;
&gt; Am I going crazy?!?! A couple months ago, after discovering that my old
rear
&gt; brake shoes hat the riveted e-brake lever, I looked around and SWEAR I
found
&gt; replacement pins and c-clips that would allow me to install my new brake
&gt; shoes.  NOW I CAN'T FIND THEM AGAIN!
