Subject: Re: [T2] Oil dripping leak

this had to be changed with engine dropped?????
i have  similar leak now ...guessing same place you were talking about...?
 
i have puddles now under the bus off the mustache bar and sometimes dripping from oil filter...
mostly mustache bar though and under fan housing on belly of tin...
not so much inside the engine compartment though...
a little round dipstick and alternator though./.
even though i have a boot on the switch i can see small dabs of oil laying in the top of the boot...
 
there was just spots till saturday when i took about an 30- 45 minute trip.... after parking i noticed that i was low on oil under half qaurt and that there was a puddle under the bus... same spot...
what was driping from the heater box ends looked like it also came from the front..or same place.. (from under belly of tin on fan houseing as well as all over bottom of mustache bar...
 
i am wondering if it is the oil switch or the dipstcik boot,,,,., going to change that later today to be sure of it or can be my oil pump...?
 
76 bus 2.0 ltr engine 
 
congrats to you on your find...
and fix
peace
chris
