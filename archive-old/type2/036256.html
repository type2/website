Subject: Mystery Switch 

'Morning Everyone,
        My '76 Westy ( started out as a Deluxe, somtime during it's hard life 
all the equipment that made it a Deluxe was ripped out, now has the standard 
config., ie no stove, fridge) has a switch down by the brake fluid reservoir 
under the drivers seat. It is the same switch that is on the dash for the 
rear window defroster ( a green knob with a curly-Q line through it). While I 
was under it this weekend welding in the cab step area, I noticed it has a 
heavy gauge red wire running to it, but nothing connected going out. Any idea 
what this was for?  TIA, Jeff S.
