por15 (www.por15_dot_com) makes an excelllent high temp paint that is also a 
rust preventative, you will need to treat the metal first tho, as it
probalby wasnt done right to start with, there are two options,
sandblast it or use another por15 product called metal ready....

im not associated with por15 in any way other than being a very happy
consumer

&gt;  Hello All!
&gt; 
&gt;  Yesterday I recieved my extractor to go along with the single quiet pack
&gt;  muffler I ordered from RMMW.  I think that Ive heard bad things of Bugpack
&gt;  exhaust components in the past and unknowing to me, that is what RMMW sent
&gt;  me. 
&gt; 
&gt;  The problem is that on the extractor the black coating was flaking off onto
&gt;  my hands when I took it out of the box.  The muffler also had some of 
&gt; paint scraped off, but at least it wasnt sticking to my hands!
&gt; 
&gt;  Question: Anyone have a suggestion onto a high temp paint that I could 
&gt;  snag to recoat these things?
&gt; 
&gt;  I may even hit the heater boxes with the stuff as well.
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks!
