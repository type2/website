Hi Harmon
That is what i did.  i had a german capri v6 installed in a 74 vw bus with a 
KEP adapter, The rad was on the battery side and i moved the battery under 
the bed inside the bus.
it worked very well. I also put an electric twin fan set on the rad with a 
t/stat to operate them, This was in 1983 and i didn't care to know anything 
other than &quot;IT WORKED&quot;  so i didn't keep track of oil or water temps, or 
anything else for that matter, i just drove it until i needed a new exhaust 
system, i took it to a muffler shop and they had to make a new, custom 
exhaust pipe. While they worked with the metal nibbler, a few pieces fell in 
the carb!  they had the air breather off to make room to work through the 
hatch.
The piston was damaged as soon as they started it up....
I still have the bus, but the engine is long gone. I have made that bus into 
a trailer.
Later

&gt;    What I'm going to do with my diesel conversion in my '73 is use two
&gt;small radiators w/fans and put them in the rear airscoops, instead of
&gt;running them up to the front and cutting out the nose. Somebody else put
&gt;one on top and built a scoop, but I figure you can just use a Y-pipe and
&gt;two smaller radiators in the stock airscoops. Maybe bike radiators or
&gt;some of the better quality oil coolers, etc., something fairly long and
&gt;narrow.
