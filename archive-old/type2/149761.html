Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

&gt; I've noticed that some of the wooden frame (to which the
&gt; canvas is stapled) is rotting out, particularly in front where one of the
&gt; hinges mount.  I couldn't find anything in the archives.  Has anyone made
&gt; any repairs to the poptop wood frame?  I'm wondering how best to remove the
&gt; existing rotted wood and then attach new pieces (using the old pieces as a
&gt; pattern?)  Thanks.

When I had the poptop off on my bus it looked to me like that frame was used
as part of the mold for the fiberglass making it an integral part.
