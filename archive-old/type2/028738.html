&gt; What is/are the advantage(s) if any  of using a 050 distributor
&gt; versus an 009 distributor on a type IV engine?

&gt; The 050 was originally used in 356 Porsches and was valued as
&gt; a &quot;Hot Rod&quot; distributor for VW's.  Well they really didn't work all that
&gt; well in a VW because they weren't engineered to do so.  Remember,
&gt; the factory knows best for the all around performance of your engine.


You may want to check the archives (are they back up yet?) as this has been
covered.  I should note that Bosch used the 050 suffix on a couple of
different distributors.  The one in question here is the centrifugal advance
one, not the vacuum advance one. The existence of several has created some
confusion, as it results in people asking about the centrifugal one and
getting back answers about the vaccum advance one.   Of course, neither of
these, nor the 009, is what the factory wanted for your engine, as they used
a vacuum advance distributor.  Many people use an 009 in a type 4 engined
bus, and I have done so myself, but admittedly its advance curve is far from
optimal for the engine. Basically, you can time it to run right on
accelleration or at idle, but not at both. If you time it to run optimally
at idle, it will accellerate like crap, so most people time it for maximum
driving performance, resulting in timing that is way off at idle. Some
people will predict instant doom for your engine from using an 009 in it.
I've seen enough late busses run with 009s for years that I wouldn't go that
far, but it's certainly not good for your engine to be idling for extended
periods of time (i.e. rush hour) with the timing set wrong as it can lead to
overheating.  The centrifugal-advance 050 has an advance curve that has been
claimed by many listmembers to be a bit better suited than that on the 009
for the type 4 engine, thereby reducing this problem.  Somewhere on the
type2 website (busted bus?) there is/was a review of the 050 that might
might answer your question in more detail.
