Subject: Re: [T2] Question #3 Starting and resin

Thanks for the battery advice. I'll do that tonight. It's what I thought 
just wanted to make sure there was no wierd relay or something.

I think you may have misunderstood. The engine is very dirty INSIDE (not 
yelling, just emphasizing) the air intake hosing and throttle body. The 
exterior is quite clean.


&gt;&gt;You can power wash the engine if it is not scalding hot.
&gt;
&gt;That is the water can be boiling (the hotter the better) but the engine 
&gt;shouldn't be scalding hot as cool or the cold wash water might crack it....
&gt;
&gt;But you prob knew this...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ciao!
