Subject: Re: [T2] distributor drive gear backwards situation

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Faster-Laster&quot;

&gt; I had never considered just rotating the bottom of the distributor shaft, 
&gt; I bet that is much easier than trying to pull out the gear. cool trick.

6 to one..... it is a bit tricky to punch out the pin.. then take off the 
drive dog.. rotate it,, then put the pin back in...
the pin location is also a bit tricky,,, but not hard at all..

If you have the drive gear puller... it is a snap to pull the drive ... and 
reinstall it.. maybe a couple times to get it to go in the correct 
alignment.
First time I ever used one this year.... Denmiester lent me his to correct 
Potts' bus -Franklin, it was waaaay easy!

You can get frustrated trying to pull it with other tools.. like wedging a 
pencil ... or 2 screwdrivers.. or

btw... if the washer falls in... don't fret.  It won't do any harm.. it 
can't get at anything that matters.  All you need is another washer.  Put 
grease on the washer.. slide it on a long screwdriver.. use the screwdriver 
shaft to locate the placement of the washer,, and tap it ... the grease will 
act like glue to hold the washer in place while you slide in the drive .....

hope that helps
