&gt; So it's down to the wire here, volks.  I leave for a cross continent round
&gt; trip of ~8,000 miles next Tuesday morning at 7:30am (heads up for any AIRS

well I leave from Baltimore to New Haven Conn next Sunday (25th) might be
a little early for you to get here but if you are and want to carabus up
I-95 let me know, otherwise until the 1st of July I won't be around to
help you out if you call in Baltimore

&gt; First question:  Do I stand a chance of actually completing this trip, or am
&gt; I dreaming?

sure, but I don't know if I would do it until the new engine was broke in
fully.  be prepared, be very prepared.

&gt; Second question:  Distributors scare me.  I have an inordinate fear of
&gt; having this set wrong and blowing up my engine.  How do I set the
&gt; distributor timing before starting the engine?  Will I need a timing gun?

timing guns help, almost mandatory on type 4 engines

&gt; Will I need a timing gun with advance?  I've set the distributor so that at

distributor advances not timing gun, same gun

&gt; TDC for #1 the rotor is pointing at that little slot in the distributor.
&gt; But from the pictures I took when disassembling the engine it seems that the
&gt; distributor is now rotated CCW about 10 degrees from what it was before when
&gt; those marks lined up.  What's the deal?  How should I set the dizzy before
&gt; turning over the engine?

each dizzy is different.
&gt; 
&gt; Third question:  I made the mistake of taking my labels off the injector
&gt; wires after I installed them and then removed them again.  Now I'm not sure
&gt; if I have the right wires on the right injectors.  Is this bad?  How do I
&gt; make it right?

they are all the same, all 4 injectors fire at the same time so except for
the length it doesn't matter what wire goes on what injector (except the
cold start injector, which is behind the distributor)

&gt; Four:  What things can I do to ease my paranoia before I turn the engine on
&gt; for the first time?

disconnect the coil and then crank the engine over until you no longer
hear the valves, then fire er up, if you hear anything &quot;Wierd&quot; turn it off
quick
