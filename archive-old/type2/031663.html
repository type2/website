&gt; But... I got lazy during the last few weeks of calendar parking (have to 
&gt; park on alternate sides of the street each night) so I parked the bus in

&gt; the hardware store, so I drove the bus.  Ack!  When I disengaged the 
&gt; parking brake handle, it seems like the cable stuck - only it isn't 
&gt; really braking the wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, the brake pedal goes about half way down before actually 
&gt; starting to brake.  Then, if I am braking any harder than very 
&gt; slowly/gently, the 'B' light on the dash comes on.  It was my 
&gt; understanding that the 'B' light was supposed to come on whenever the 
&gt; emergency brake was engaged, but that mine was broken because it wasn't 
&gt; working like that.  :)


What year is this van, I suspect one of your brake circuits is
malfunctoning,  the B light is wired differently on different years, but
if you have dual circuit brakes it comes on when one brake circuit is
malfunctioning, and your description of the braking method makes it sound
like one side is out,,, DON'T drive it until you find out and correct
this..

check Bentley for details on check out and repair.

if you don't have dual circuit brakes, you have me stumped?!
