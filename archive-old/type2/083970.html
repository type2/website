Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheels

My '73 panel has the hard (and very cracked) one.  But maybe because its
a panel and not &quot;deluxe&quot;... yet.

&gt; And, insofar as the hard plastic steering wheels go, I'm not absolutely sure,

&gt; hard plastic was still around then too.  I think.  Anybody care to chime in
