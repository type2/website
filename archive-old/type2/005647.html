Has anyone ever tried fabricating a setup that would allow a valve to be
mounted directly to the fuel tank outlet [on a carb'd bus]?

Such an installation would allow _all_ sections of the fuel line to be
replaced without having to plug the tank outlet.

It would also be helpful in draining the tank prior to removal, etc.  You
could close the valve and disconnect the fuel line [catching the backflow
from the fuel line in a suitable container].  Then attach a temporary length
of fuel hose to extend down into your gas can and open the valve to drain
the tank.  If it was necessary to use multiple containers to hold all the
drained fuel, you could just close the valve while changing gas cans with no
risk of spillage.

Inquiring minds, etc.........

&gt;&gt;  yup, great!  I have em on my bus and changed the fuel filter Fri in
about
10 minutes with nary a drop spilled.  two brass ball valves one on each
fuel line (FI) great for removing the engine or changing fuel filters,
also extra security when leaving parked in ???? area, one I can reach
without going under car...if you know exactly where to reach  &lt;&lt;
