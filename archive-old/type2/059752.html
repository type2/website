Subject: Re. Ardmore, OK?

The place is Earl Mann's VW I believe. If you get to Ardmore just ask one of
the locals about his place. As best I remember it's just east of town. I
bicycled past it on Freewheel a couple of years ago. He does some really nice
V-Dub restorations. One of the guys that works for Phillips up here had him
restore a 69 Ghia from the ground up. Did a beautiful job with lots of
attention to detail. Cost him aprox. $9900 dollars which included Earl Mann
finding a restoreable Ghia, total rebuild including a stock 1500, and air
conditioning. Not a bad price for a &quot;new&quot; car. Hope this helps.
