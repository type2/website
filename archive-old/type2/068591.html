&gt;Latest Rage (uh, did I say SoCal?) offers a Bench Mount for $18.00 and a
&gt;'floor' model (which tears down for storage) for $40.00.  No catalog no.s.
&gt;Fax order no. is 310-404-5001, phone order no. is 310-404-5001

Watch their handling and shipping charges. I ordered Bentley from them and
wound up paying a higher price due to shipping and handling that I
overlooked. But they did send what I ordered within the agreed-upon time.
