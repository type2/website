The plastic sliders you need are to be sewn to the curtain's header.

I've written about the sliders a lot, most recently ~a month ago.  Check the
archives, and drop me a line if you have questions...

&gt;&gt;  Man you are awesome.  I saw this earlier.  Your spec's are right on,
down to the little hook on the closet.  How many little plastic pieces?   :)

I counted because I am trying to figure how to utilize them.  My idea,
grommets in the fabric, and maybe a small &quot;s&quot; hook wrapped around the little
plastic slider..  Problem, haven't found an &quot;s&quot; hook smaller than
3/4 &quot;.  I found some cool little grommets in the craft area of Wal Mart.  I
did see some little clips in the fishing tackle area, I considered them.  &lt;&lt;
