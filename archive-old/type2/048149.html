&gt; I ordered a VDO oil pressure gauge and dual-Sender for my bus, '72 Westy
&gt; w/1700, from Bus Depot, haven't installed it yet.
&gt; 
&gt; But I'm wondering if I should have also ordered the:
&gt; 
&gt; VDO Extension Adaptor for 360006 Oil Pressure Sender,
&gt; needed for 84-91 Vanagon, helps with 73-83
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if the guideline &quot;helps with 73-83&quot; is necessarily all inclusive?
&gt; 
&gt; Also are there any good sites on the web showing how to install a this gauge
&gt; and the oil temperature gauge for the mechanical challenged (moi)?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks, Kevin

The sender is too big and would require cutting a new hole in the tin to get
it in. I bought the extension adapter. You take the end that threads into
the hole where the current sensore is and use some plumbers tape (teflon) to
get a nice seal and no oil leakage. The other end requires an adapter (comes
with extension) that then connects to the sensor. Do not use the tape on
this end because the sensor must be grounded to work. There is also a
mounting strap for the sensor and a sheet metal screw. You can mount to the
engine tin or I mounted mine to the fan housing with an existing screw.
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
