&gt;Besides the charcol cannister, wasn't there an AIR pump also?


Nope, not on 72.  That started in 74.  I think it was just 74 and 75
California models.  Went away with FI, I believe.  I had a 1976 Mercury
Capri with one of those pumps.  It was basically just a mini supercharger,
but pumped air into the exhaust instead of the intake.  A bit of a drag when
they were new, but as soon as the bushings got worn and the grease dried up,
it added a lot of drag.

Regards,

Grant
