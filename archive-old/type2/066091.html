To All:

I wish to thank all of you who took the trouble to help me solve the ten-code
mystery: 10-19  --  'Return/returning to ___________'

I was able to respond directly to the first replies then work interferred
with play.  The next time I checked the mail there were more than a dozen
'Re:  CB Talk' messages in the mailbox. 

Please accept, collectively, this note of thanks that time does not allow me
to tender individually.

- -Bob
