SOTO?

Mom said If you don't have anything nice to say then say nothing at all. OK,
Mom here you go...

&lt;Nothing at all&gt;
Um, used to have cool T-Shirts at the Anniversary events when it was held in
Escondido. It cost as much for membership and a cool T-shirt as it was for
entrance fees alone. I was lucky and received a couple of newsletters over
the years &lt;xeroxes of other peoples art and a couple of light weight
&quot;articles.&quot; also included a staple.&gt;
As far as this years T-shirts at the Garden Grove Event? 
Mom thing = &lt;Nothing at all&gt;

The last time I spoke with Mr. Heard (in order to track him down and
threaten death and dismemberment over a long over due purchase involving a
quickly cashed check and no item etc.) I was told that he was very busy
because he went back to school to study &quot;Law Enforcement.&quot; Um, shoemakers kids? 
This is the point where you should search the archives for the comments
about the cops woomping the &quot;caca&quot; out of the illegal alien Messikins on the
freeway in Riverside, California. &quot;Ah say~ed, Git down offin dah guardrail!,
*Woomp* No habla? Hokay, I'll say it louder! Ah SAY~ED, GIT DOWN OFFIN DAH
GUARDRAIL!!! *Woomp* etc. Caliornia needs more good officers. (un-huh) Be
sure to include the Dancing bear sticker and a personalized licence plate
that reads POT4ME. (not)

NEATO:
Excellent Organization for lovers of VW buses. Primary original focus has
been on pre-1968 model years. Some exceptions creep in with nearly no one
complaining. 

Newsletters:
Excellent Newsletter that actually shows up in the mail on a (ahem) regular
semimonthly basis, give or take a few days. (six per year). A little anal
about content of cartoons by smart*** guys from Arizona...

Transporter Tourist Traveler Directory:
NEATO offers its members a travelers directory which contains first names
and phone numbers of members according to geographical area and submitted by
the members on a voluntary basis. (No home addresses for obvious reasons).
Codes indicate what type of assistance and facilities may be available from
the local members.

International connections:
A window of opportunity pops up annually for the membership to become
members of the UK (uh, like Britain/Wales/Scotland/Ireland and &quot;stuff&quot;)club
named the Split Screen Volkswagen Club and the German groupe named the Bulli
Cartei at reduced rates which translates into receipt of a SSVC newsletter
occasionally, membership window stickers etc.

Contact/Membership Info:
Many list members are NEATO members because they are smart people. A few
boardmembers are also buried amongst us somewhere on this list.

a copy of the Transporter Tourist Traveler Directory
