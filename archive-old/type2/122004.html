&gt;Santa also left an electronic ignition kit under the tree for me.  I

&gt;they sell only the one with the correct resistance, and a new coil 
&gt;certainly can't hurt anyway.  Cheap insurance at $30.

I bought the blue coil as a spare. When I swapped it in I didn't notice any difference although it was supposed to be &quot;hotter&quot;. I'm sure the black coil the factory put in produces plenty of nice sparks before it goes kaput.
