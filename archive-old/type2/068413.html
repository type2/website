My Westy propane tank holds just over 2 gallons and lasts only about four

Does anyone have suggestions for finding/ mounting alternative propane 
tanks?

So I wrote:

Hmmm... I don't even know how much mine holds ('78 Westy) since
no one will fill it without inspection and approval by someone in the fire 
dept. Probably the same size as everyone else's.  Problem is, no one around 
town seems to know just who could give this required inspection (must happen 
every 5 years. Local fire fighters said, &quot;Huh?&quot;

SO I went out and got a 2.5 gallon bottle that I carry around on the roofrack.
I've got a hose long enough to reach in the window of the poptop and connect
to a stove that I put on the countertop. Voila!

I suppose if I ever get around to it, I might get my stock tank inspected
and use it, but I'm in no hurry. ANd if it fails inspection due to rust,then 
I'm hosed anyway. I could remove it, and with it any worry that I'll hit a rock
and blow up like the Hindenberg.

I used my 2.5 gallon tank most of last summer while camping all over the western
US and when I filled it, I was only down a gallon! So I wonder if you've got 
a leak or something like the world's most inefficient stove. 

 My 2 cents,
