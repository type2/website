Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Allen Head bolts =(

This worked beautifully on the 1st bolt I tried it on..but of course,
the other 2 are stubborn and don't seem to want to turn.  I'm going to
try and grind off the chamfer on the allen bit I have and try my
impact driver again tonight.  If that doesn't work I'll just cut the
heads off..I didn't realize how long the bolts were until I got one
out.

Thanks for all the help and advice

&gt; Get a 12 point socket that is a hair smaller than the outside diameter of
&gt; stripped allen and beat it on there. Should come off. I do that on stripped
&gt; CV bolts. Works everytime. Good luck
