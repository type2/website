Subject: [T2] rear brakes

I'm having a problem with the rear brakes on my 79
westy, they work good, it's just that they have a
medium pithced hum that turns into a high pitched ring
when im coming to a stop. I recently put on new drums,
hardware, and pads. I noticed that the retainer clips
that hold the top upper spring and support bar are
missing. could this be the problem? Anyone have some
lying around? Pre thanks for any help.
