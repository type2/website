Don't immerse them in solvent.  What I do is put them in an oil pan and
spray the exterior with a can of Berryman (the best, IMO) carb cleaner till
it is clean.  It's a good idea to do this before you open up the carbs,
cause it's less likely that you will knock dirt into where it isn't
supposed to be.  Clean is the rule when you're opening up the carbs.
