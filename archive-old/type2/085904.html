Subject: van dead - new van?

Well, my van finally kicked the bucket.  It's most certainly dead.  Pretty 
disheartened right now, I put a lot of TLC into her.  Because I'm going 
between Kentucky &amp; New York multiple times a year I really isn't reasonable 
to rebuild my 82 air-cooled.

With that in mind, I'm looking for an 86 or 87 wolfsburg, weekender edition 
that has a bad engine but is in otherwise real good shape.  I want to just 
drop a new engine in it.  I really need to get on this as soon as possible 
so if anyone knows anything please let me know.  I'm trying not to spend too 
much money as I'm planning to get an engine from Boston Bob, which I'm very 
excited about.  I'd really settle for any weekender package but I'd like to 
avoid the westys.  I live in Frankfort, KY so if anyone knows something 
close by that would be fantastic.  Thanks a bunch guys.

  -Andrew
