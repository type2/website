Re..price on camper?????
&gt;

&gt;&quot;I have a 78 camper model that is an automatic, and I was wondering what
&gt;would
&gt;be a fair price to sell it? 
..Hmmm, you don't say much about WHY it breaks down, pretty hard to sell.
Depending on where
&gt;you are, give ME $500 and I'll take it off your hands....
&gt;------&gt;
Hate to throw a wet blanket on your trying to sell the van!!   but
have to agree with John....there aren't a lot of pluses going 
for this sale!....Good parts vehicle?? 

You may end up selling...but I don't think it will be for price you had
in mind....up here  that would be strictly parts vehicle....too
much money to throw at it..versus end value of vehicle...
