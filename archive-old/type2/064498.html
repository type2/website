Hi All

I have come across a bus, a Ghia and an engine / trans axle that look like they need 
rescue. Since I am not that familar with the years and numbers of pre 70 models I will 
put down what I known and someone may be interested.

1. 1950 type 2 coming up for auction this Sat. Sept 28, auction flyer says 1950 ?? 
 
    eng. no. 3470540 

    Typ 24      580268
     950          1000    these numbers were on the plate in the                        
                          engine compartment.
     
    
2. 1957 ? Ghia, long family story but original miles at 51000. This would be a    
   private sale.
    
    eng. no. 122-0304

    Typ 14       2775649
     1110
      450           660    these numbers on plate in front                              
                           compartment

3. Engine and trans axle, probably from a dune buggy. Private sale.
   eng.no. D0525476

Would anyone be able to confirm the year on these VW's and give me a ballpark value. 

Thanks 
Ross
