I just got back from a delightful weekend with the Boneaus, Don and Amy.
They are Good People, who naturally follow Lazurus Long's advice to
&quot;treat your guests like family.&quot;

Saturday we visited and barbequed, and Sunday Don and I worked on my
bus. During the course of the day I met all the neighbors. :-) We put a
petcock valve in the fuel line between the tank and the filter, and
changed the filter (piece o' cake with that valve in place). We tested
out the 3-jaw oil filter wrench and it works beautifully. We adjusted
the carbs and tried out the synchronizers we had; the fancy one needs a
special adapter we didn't have, but the cheapo one worked okay (once I
get more acquainted with carbs I *will* spring for a better one). We
also did a compression test and it's good -- about 115 all around.

However -- and this is odd -- after we got the plugs back in, I did the
test where you pull the wires off the distributor one at a time to see
if the engine falters. The #2 plug did not, so that cylinder's not
pulling its weight. We've got spark at the plug wire at the distributor
end, spark at the plug wire at the plug end, and spark from the plug.
The plug is properly gapped and not fouled, and seated well. We've got
115 lbs of compression. I stayed another night so we could troubleshoot
during the daytime, but it's a mystery. Wassssssuuuuuppppp?

More on the #2 plug -- my plug socket has a rubber insert that doesn't
fit the plug well, so Don gave me one that fit better (he's accumulated
quite a few over the years). That cuts down the frustration factor
significantly, so if you're having trouble with that plug falling out of
the socket, try another socket with a tighter insert. Don also showed a
tricky little maneuver where you use a length (6-8&quot;) of 15/32 vacuum
hose, stick the top end of the plug in the end of the hose, and use the
hose to position and start the #2 plug in the hole. Verrrrry clever!
