&gt; Do the '79 California busses NOT have an EGR filter and valve?
&gt; I don't see one on my '79, and it does not look like one was ever
&gt; there. Bentley talks about an EGR for a '79 bus, but I am wondering
&gt; if that only means the Federal model. 

I'm sure all models - Federal and California - had EGR filters and 
valves.  Looking at my Bentley, it looks like the EGR filter/valve setup 
is the same (pretty much) as on my '81; a mechanical EGR valve that 
mounts to the FI air distribution box.  So if that's all missing I'd 
expect to see an empty spot on the left front of the air distribution box 
where the valve has been removed.  If you're not seeing that, I wonder if 
the original air distribution box and throttle body assembly were 
replaced by parts from a pre-January 1976 model?  It looks like the setup 
was different then, such that the removal might not be as apparent.


Does the O2 sensor on the
&gt; '79 Cal bus somehow replace the EGR filter and valve?

No.
