Subject: Re: [T2] Brake fluid disposal (was Should caliper bleed screw
  leak?)

Zach,

Classified as a &quot;hazardus&quot; waste material by virtually the entire world.

Your city or county trash/recycle guys will have a solution for 
you....they may have special days where they will pick up used oil and 
stuff, or like where I live, we have a hazardus waste recycling 
center(county) where I take things like that about every 6 months.

I live in the country, so if it goes on the ground, I end up with it in my 
well water later....not good at all!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Its been like 8 yrs for me. When I do it (which I will before the bus is 
&gt; on the road again) do I need to do anything special to dispose of the fluid.
