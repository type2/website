Subject: odd problem with FI system
Message-ID: &lt;f5d35426.24ac5ed0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

   Hey All,
O.K., I've searched the archives, and found some similar situations, but no 
answers that i want to go on. 
   My problem seems to be somewhere in the FI system. Its a 79 2.0 engine. It 
just started acting up, and i'm planning to leave for my cross country 
excursion on tuesday at the latest.
   The other day i started it up and let it run to warm up a little. about 30 
or 40 seconds into it, it just cut off and stalled. No boggin', no jumpin', 
no coughin', it just stalled. I started it back up and drove around the block 
like five times to keep it goin, and once it was warm, it kept running.
    I shut it off and found that the braided hose (coming from that black box 
right in the center of the engine next to the distributer) that goes to the 
real thick hose from the air filter was frayed and falling off. So i fixed 
that and thought that it cleared it up. Apparently it didnt.
   I drove on it for a day, and it didnt give any problems after running for 
about five minuets or so. Today i decided to drive over to my friends house, 
and it started out without stalling, but about a mile down the road it became 
a little jerky at low RPM's. As i accelerated at the low end of each gear, it 
kinda felt like i was running over those rumble strips that they put on the 
side of the road to wake you awake. When i was going out to start it to come 
home, it wouldnt fire. 
   Well, Becky drove me home and here i am all buggin out about my FI system 
actin up right before i depart on a 10,000 mile journey. I would like to cure 
this thing my self, but have little understanding of FI systems even after 
reading three books of different explinations. I get the gist of it, but 
diagnosing a problem seems to be out of my hands. I'm gonna take it to a shop 
to check out unless i get some sound advice. The other thing i was thinkin of 
is the shotgun method, but rather wouldnt. I figured i would start with the 
cold start valve and some sensors. 
    Any advice will be greatly looked upon.  Thanks...
