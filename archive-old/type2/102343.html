Subject: Re: [T2] I need a ride to Dead o' Winter

&gt;I'm pissed for sure.  It has only 12,000 miles on it since the last rebuild.
&gt;It never really ran right since then.  MPG was 14 average, down from 19, and
&gt;it would never idle just right, as if a valve was sticking.  I'll see what I
&gt;can work out with the rebuilder.

Bearing clearances are too tight? I've heard of building an engine too 
tight that seizes along the way.
