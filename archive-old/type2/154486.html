Subject: RE: [T2] &amp;*%^$#$$  Heater Boxes, U-Pipes and exhaust leaks. 
  Gotta be  something better.

&gt; I have on my 78 used J tubes (made from a 72-74 heater box). 
&gt; and the Bus Depot sold stainless muffler for the 72-74 bus. 
&gt; it has worked reliably for over 5 years and except for a 
&gt; place where one of the J tubes cracked and needed welding I 
&gt; have not had any trouble with the system.
&gt; 
&gt; as far as I know all parts are still avaliable.



Except, alas, the stainless muffler. We do have very high quality OEM
mufflers in mild steel (MUCH more substantial than any of the aftermarket
extractor systems), but the manufacturer of the stainless ones went
belly-up.
