Subject: signal relay

--0-508996601-1024939750=:68682


This weekend, by messing around where I don't belong under my dash, I somehow made my signals not work.  Because my emergancy flashers do not work now either I am led to believe that the problem is with my relay....the Bentley book says to test this (to see if I broke it) to &quot;...connect + or - 49 of the relay to terminal 30 of the fuse box....&quot;.   My first question is (and I hate to sound uneducated) but what is terminal 30?...I see the #'s on the relay box but not for the fuse box.  Also, is there a good pic somewhere of what my (made in July of 1972) connections should look like?  It is possible that I may have just disconnected something unknowingly...

Anyway, thanks for the help in advance
