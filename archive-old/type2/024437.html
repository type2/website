 Don't bother with a spray booth - use your backyard, driveway or garage.
 
 It WILL be messy so the driveway or yard is better. (OVERSPRAY). Watch for 
 overspray problems on your house or car and the neighbors stuff as well. &gt;&gt;

        Have to disagree here, for the reasons you mention. Unless you live 
on ten acres, you could be hit with expenses that far exceed the cost of a 
professional paint job, i.e. repainting your neighbors car, house, etc. In 
addition, when painting outside ( and I have done it twice) your vehicle 
becomes a bug magnet-every flying insect for miles around will land on the 
wet paint-I've had it happen. Also, be careful when using the hardener-read 
the cautions on the can-it specifies the use of a respirator with an outside 
air source, a dust mask just won't cut it. I am currently prepping my '77 
Westy for paint, which I will do myself. I hope to rent a spray booth, but if 
I can't I'll do it in my garage, and I am going to wear my SCUBA vest with 
air tanks.
