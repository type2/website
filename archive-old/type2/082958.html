Russell,

I believe that we are talking about a weight transfer thing here as
well.

Having all the weight transferred on the back wheels and tire's and
having the front en lite, can't be a safe situation, and most certainly
can't be good for the tires, or whatever suspension there is left---

I put Air shocks in the back of my 74 Westy, and the top studs bent,
almost as soon as I installed them----this heavy duty shock thing is
superseding the the intended suspension component's, the torsion bar's,
and I don't belive a shock was intended, or should be expected to carry
the whole load-- 

A shock should be used to supplement the springs, or in this case the
torsion bar's---

I had my bar's adjusted, and added new shocks all the way around----and
the bus handle's, and rides as new---gives me the option of loading up
the Bus to it's intended capacity, without dragging the back bumper on
the asphalt, and prevents me from performing coitus interuptus with my
headlamps at night, on the neighbor's bedroom window's---:&gt;)


Later,


Terry

Rear-revisited 
I installed coil over shocks to raise the rear of my 71. I noticed a
definite improvement in the handling and stability at highway speeds,
which is, of course, my opinion. The improvement, real or percieved,
could be due to the increased overall spring rate rather than purely due
to raising the rear, or a combination of both - who knows?

John asked: 
What are the other reasons (besides appearance) to do this adjustment?? 
=A0=A0Does it affect handling? Is it going to be harmful to my bus'
suspension if I DO NOT do this, and leave the rear to sag???&lt;&lt; 
John, 
i asked this same question a while back. i think it depends on each bus
on a case-by-case basis. to determine if you really _need_ to do this, i
might suggest looking at tire wear. are the treads wearing evenly, etc.?
also, do your CV joints seem to be wearing out quickly, etc.? 
if the sag isn't causing apparent problems, then i would be inclined to
say you do not need to fix the sag. 
i would like to hear more input from other listees. i, like John, have
pondered this issue before.
