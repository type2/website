Subject: Re: [T2] 76 resale value

Mike,

Prices are all over the place though.  Some guy has a 76 parked on a major 
street here and is asking $6900 for a non camper deluxe...not bad, but not 
too good either.._dot_usual rust spots, no restoration, seems to run ok.

At the same time, a friend of mine just bought a 75 with better interior, 
but the paint makes it look like a blue holstein cow.  Will run better 
with about $400 worth of engine fixes, but he is driving it to work every 
day....and he paid a little less than $3,000.

These were both standard non camper buses.

I think it has to do with how much money people have.  There was point 
just a few years ago, that $3,000 cash was just out of reach for a lot of 
people....now I think it is not.  Especially for people(frugal people) who 
look at $60,000(or more) minicampers and then happen to see a westy on the 
street.  How much less is the insurance for something you use a few times 
a year, and how much repair can you do for waaaay less than half of what 
the new stuff costs?

Cheers, dave

&gt; You know, I just put up an ad for my friend's 76 westy that was in ok 
&gt; condition.. interior needed a bit of work and the exterior paint was quite 
&gt; faded and there were areas that needed work.  Yet, it sold for 2950 in a 
&gt; heartbeat.  I wouldn't be surprised if a late bay westy goes for 4-5k, if not 
&gt; more.  That's pretty neat that our buses are holding value.
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I'd mention that tidbit of info...
