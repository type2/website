Persoanlly,

I pull the fuel hose before the fuel pump... If i'm running hte engine i
dont want the fuel pump to be sitting there trying to pump gas where there
is no way for it to get out, i'd be afeared for the diaphraghm, it takes a
little while for the float bowl to run dry...

take care,

Steve
