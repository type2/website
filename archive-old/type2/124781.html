Subject: Re: [T2] front door panels - all the same ?

&gt; I am working on a 71 bus and also a  72 Westy  poptop
 just wondering if all the door panels are the same 1968 till 1979.
 if not where do they change ?

 Do not really car if the &quot;look&quot; is not the same
 more interested if the function is diffurent , like window crank holes, clips
 to mount them etc.
 might need to make a pick-a-part run and hate to buy ones that I cannot use

Your 71 may or may not have a air duct on them. Most passenger buses did. Westies do not.

68 and 69 did not have the ventilation grille in the lower rear corner. I believe this started in 70, maybe
71.

76 and up Westies have three round screw holes in the door panel for the arm rest. Buses have two odd shaped
holes for the pull strap.

Overall, the outside shape is all the same.
