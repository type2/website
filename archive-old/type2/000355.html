To those of you who have been following my trials and tribulations in
getting my newly painted '71 Westy back together in 5 days I am saving both
the best and worst for last.

I decided to install the new pop-top canvas myself. After all, after reading
the one page instruction  and the articles in the Type 2 Library, how hard
could it be. Got an electric stapler, staple remover, knife, tape measure,
and any an all tool I could possibly use. What I didn't count on was a guy
named Murphy that wrote some kind of law about things going wrong. He showed
up with a vengeance.

Started on day4 with a trial fit. Thought I had everything measured
perfectly. I had it so perfect(right) that it took me from 9:00 am till 2:00
PM to get it even all over. Staple-fit, remove staples-refit, staple- fit,
remove staples....... Get the idea. Murphy shows up again and the electric
stapler takes a dump. Got a new one and finally got the fit right. Great.

Tried installing the bottom frame. Used an awl to get the screws through the
canvas piping and line up the hole. Great- sides are going wonderful. Murphy
steps up again and screw heads start breaking off. Then I get to the
corners. I cut the piping at 45 degree angles but it still bunched up and
the corners would fit flush against the top. Not a bad gap and it looks ok
from the outside. I plan to replace all the screws next summer and correct
the corner problems.

When I finally extended the pop-top and stood back to look at it, I was
really impressed with myself. I think it looks great. Not too loose and not
overly stretched. No tears. All is well.

With that done I was ready to take my bus home. Loaded up all my stuff and
off I went. Found a million and one little things that need attention but I
will be driving it by the weekend. My goal achieved.

All in all, it has been the most rewarding 5 days I have  spent in a long
time. I feel I developed a very personal relationship with Goldie (my bus)
and plan on keeping her happy for a long, long time.

Looking forward to seeing you all at events in the coming year and &quot;keep on
Bussin&quot;

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
