However lots of other people have had good results moving from points
to elec ignition. I am one of them.

&gt; When electronic ignitions go out,

Course, this is the same as when points go out. So when you have
electronic or points you should keep a spare set of points anyway.
Replacing the points back takes just a small amount of more time.
