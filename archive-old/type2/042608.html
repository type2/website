Subject: RE: New Bus Owner and Turn Signal Question

Jeremy-

&gt; Yesterday I picked up my first bus. It's not something that
&gt; most of you would write home about, but it's my bus :)

Congratulations on your purchase!


&gt; my turn signals do not work...nor does my dimmer switch work

&gt; around the bottom of the front window
&gt; there are a few rust throughs

These things are probably related.  The turn-signal and dimmer relays
are perfectly positioned (right under the windshield) and oriented
(upside-down) to catch water leaking in through a leaking winshield. If
yours were/are full of water, you might be able to resurrect the current
ones by opening them up (not too hard), letting them dry out if wet, and
then cleaning the contacts.  If that doesn't work you can buy
replacements for about $10-$15 apiece.  You may have other problems too,
but that's where I'd start.

Good luck!
