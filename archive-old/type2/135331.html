&gt;Wow, that's interesting.
&gt;I guess you've already looked, but the arm operating the plunger (accel 
&gt;pump) is prone to wear. Does the actual plunger get full stroke? Maybe try 
&gt;operating it on it's own. Does the plunger definitely return all the way 
&gt;(spring may be weak)?

It seems ok to me. These carbs have 50k miles on them.

&gt;Could the inlet to the pump be blocked (that area is 
&gt;prone to corrosion, bottom of float bowl).

I've blown through all orifices with air. I can't see inside or have any idea how much cleaner should come out with the air.

&gt;Float level is really strange, If the float is hitting the top the level 
&gt;&quot;should be&quot; much less than spec. I assume you have new needle/seat? They 
&gt;also vary in size/shape so compare it to the old ones.

The new float valve is the same height as the old one except it doesn't have a ball bearing at the end. I tested both valves and they give the same float level.

&gt;I have also seen the 
&gt;thread damaged and it prevents you screwing it all the way in. Is the float 
&gt;definitely correct 7grm I think?

It's marked 7g, weighs the same and does not leak.

&gt;Another thing I have seen is some gaskets hang into the float bowl a fair 
&gt;way and fowl with the movement of the float (prevents it coming all the way 
&gt;up. This produces the opposite problem though!!

Wait a second. If the float can't rise then it will displace more water but when I take off the top half to look at it the float will move and the level will change...I should compare the gaskets.

&gt;Is it the same for left and right carb??

Still only working on the left carb, using the right one as an assembled reference...

&gt;I'm really guessing now. Maybe a pic or two and I might spot something 

I'll post the rest of the photos tonight. Thanks for all the help so far.
