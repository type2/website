&gt; I noticed that lots of you run two batteries one for driving, one for

&gt; sort of switch you install to switch batteries? It sounds cool, I would
&gt; love to have my radio on at night and not be worried if I could start in
&gt; the morning. What is the most common way to go about the two battery
&gt; setup?

the most common way is the automatic relay, however always being a little
different I have a boat battery switch in which I can issolate either or
both of my batteries whenever I chose.  not automatic but unlikely to ever
fail either.
