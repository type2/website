Hi List,

My 70 Westy has that little black knob on the inside of the rear hatch. I
know this subject came up recently on the list, but a search of the archive
did not turn up an answer to how this is supposed to operate the lock. Do
you turn it or move it in some direction? I don't want to force it and break
it like my other 70.

Thanks

Jeff
