Subject: how to tell if a valve is bent when the valve spring keeper is
  busted

So.... I went to do a tune up and the #4 exhaust spring keeper is came out
with the valve cover. The valve stem is off-center (IE not lined up with
the tappet head) and the spring is out of line. I called the local repair
shop and they said that the valve is bent and that it needs a new head
($350) and $600 in labor. ee gads. While in general I really like this
place, this totally sounds like &quot;talking up&quot; a project. Maybe the valve is
bent, but does this mean that a new head is the only way to go? and ten
hours labor? sure it would take me a week to get that thing fixed, but I am
an idiot, not a pro.


 So my question is how do I tell if the valve is bent? If it is bent do I
really need a new head, or can I get my existing head rebuilt for less? And
does anyone know how to pull a type IV head without removing the engine? I
don't have a really good jack and it would be wort the extra time and
effort to keep the motor in (I also don't have any help this week for heavy
work). This is the same valve spring that the PO replaced before I picked
it up, and I wonder is the valve was already bent when he replaced it....

I was on the road when the engine started acting up (lost some power ran
unevenly) I ran it about ten miles home (carefully) before parking it.
