Is this it?  I have a '78 and I can't find this part inside the tank
compartment.  Where is it?

Fuel Tank 'T' Breather back in stock
Submitted by Mark A _at_ 2:15 pm
After years of being obsolete, Just Kampers have now had this useful part
reproduced. If you have a '68 - '79 Bay Window which suffers from fuel
smells in the cabin, a perished 'T' piece breather is the most likely cause=
.
The cost of this somewhat essential part is just =A35.95 + P+P (search for
part # 211201405 in the katalogue )
