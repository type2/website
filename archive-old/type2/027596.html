Hi everyone,
   I've got the camping interior out of our 71 westy to make a new floor.  I 
figure that this is the time to take care of the metal floor too and will be 
repairing it, and painting it with POR15.
   While I'm in there I want to touch up some other spots on the interior.  
Does anyone know the proper paint name or number for the interior?  Or am I 
just best off to take one of those 30 year old interior pieces to the paint 
shop and have them try and match it?
