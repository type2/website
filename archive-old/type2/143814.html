Subject: Multimeter fried?

We'll, I broke out the digital multimeter with
hopes of figuring out why I've had starting
problems... and hoping it's not a solenoid
hotstart problem.  I've had it quite awhile and
lost my directions.  Anyway, I crossed the
positive and negative across the battery and made
smoke from within the thin.  Any chance I didn't
kill it?  

Are there any multimeter for dummies pages out
there?  I really have NO CLUE what to do with
this thing?  I don't really even know what some
of the symbols mean.  Kind of explains my
aversion to FI, right?

Feelin' pretty dumb tonight....


Happy bussin'
