Subject: ignition barrel

Occationally my '74 Westy doesn't turn off when you turn the key off.
But about 80% of the time when you pull the key out of the barrel it stops.
It seems more frequent when its only running for a short while e.g. moving
it out of the driveway.

It did have a relay put in the engine bay so the power wasn't going up to
the dash and then back to the engine. Could this be the culprit?

Are the ignition barrels easy to disasemble?

Ant.
