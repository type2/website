Subject: upper to lower brake resevoir connection/seal

Volks,

Well, I ran into a bit of a problem with the axle beam install this
evening.  All is going well, lots more pictures taken, but...

The '73 has an upper resevoir under the driver's seat and a lower resevoir
on top of the M.C. with a hard plastic tube running between them.  There
is a rubber sleeve that seals the tube to the lower resevoir.  Well, there
*should be* a sleeve that seals the lower tube to the resevoir, but mine
is, as our british members would say, &quot;perished&quot;  I have not even begun to
look for a source, but figured I would start here.... anyone got a good
one in their parts box?  A commonly available alternative?  The location
of this item is makes it a PITA, to put it mildly to install and I don't
want to make any more trips to this area than I have to.

                           Steve Dolan
