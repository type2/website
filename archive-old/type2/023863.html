Subject: Excessive exhaust smoke and loss of power ?
Date: Mon, 2 Jul 2001 11:07:12 +0100

I had a big problem with my 79 type 2 at the weekend.

Just got on the motorway when the engine suffered a loss of power and the
van started to cut out and the acceleration was completely non-existent.

I pulled over checked the fan belt and oil and both were in order so as I
was on the motorway I attempted to get to the next exit which was a few
miles down the road. I could only get the van up to about 30 -35 in third
and limp a long.

I eventually made it off the motorway and parked up. Their was excessive
smoke coming out of the exhaust at idle.

I have had a rebuild to take unleaded (with hardened valves) about two years
ago and have done around 6000 miles on this engine and have a service every
6 months in which time I would do no more then 2000 miles.

Has anyone any ideas what the problem could be ?

Cheers for any pointers.
