Subject: Brian Stephen's Mystery 72 Bus

Congratulations on the purchase of your 72 bus! Welcome to the club.

About your mystery camper. An ex-husband and I bought a 72 camper, brand new
from a VW dealer in Monterey California. It was the Sierra Yellow, non-pop
top. It was a VERY basic version. Had the standard light grey-white vinyl
floor in back, yellow/brown white plaid curtains, yellow vinyl upholstery in
the back, kids cot up front, jalousie windows w/screens, full width bed,
swing up table, little stool, birch paneling, storage under the back seat
with no access door and a full-width storage cabinet with a hinged door over
the way back. It was a walk through. The camper conversion was done by
Westfalia.

What it didn't have: Jump seat behind the driver, sink-ice box behind the
passenger seat, electrical outlet on the driver's side, access door to the
storage area under the seat. The little stool strapped to a small bracket on
the panel behind the driver where the jump seat usually lives.

So, Westfalia was making some other variations on the standard Westy set up.
Through the years, I've seen three other buses like the one I described
above. They were all Sierra Yellow.

Happy Bussing!
