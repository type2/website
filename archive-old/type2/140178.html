Subject: RE: [T2] BusDepot Website Navigation / Finding Parts

&gt; Is there a search window to put in a part name rather than a
&gt; #?  I would like that.


Yes, I should have been more specific in my last post. Actually, ALL search
boxes on BusDepot_dot_com will accept either keywords or part numbers.

The search boxes on the main (white) page can search either keywords OR part
numbers, and display only those results that fit your year (or even a
specific part category if you have drilled down that far):

&gt; The context-sensitive &quot;search all of the above parts&quot; box, also located on
each page.
&gt; This search becomes more specific as you drill down. For example, if you
choose
&gt;  &quot;72-79 bus&quot; in the main drop-down menu, then the search box on the
resulting
&gt;  (white) page searches only within 72-79 Bus parts. If you go one step
further after
&gt; choosing &quot;72-79 Bus&quot; and choose &quot;Brakes&quot; on the next page, now the same
search
&gt;  box limits its results only to Brake parts within those years. If you
drill down one step
&gt;  further and click on &quot;Front Brakes,&quot; now the same search box only
searches Front
&gt; Brake parts within those years. And so on.

The search box on the yellow left menu bar, by comparison, is a site-wide
parts search - it searches the entire BusDepot parts database, regardless of
vehicle application. This means it can find part numbers that exist in the
database but do not yet have vehicle application data (which may fit your
year, even though we don't have them keyed in as such yet; there are many of
these, with 190k parts to sift through).  On the other hand, it will also
display parts that don't fit your year at all.  While it is labeled as a
part number search, in fact it too will also search keywords.
