Subject: Free Backissues of Hot-VW magazine

I did some &quot;spring cleaning&quot; today in my utility room for the first time
since we moved here 6 years ago.   (Okay, so it's not quite spring yet;
they're predicting 1-2 feet of snow here later today!)  It's amazing how
much junk you accumulate in six years! In the process, Under all of the
other junk, I found a box of about 50 back-issues of VW magazines, about
8-10 years old; mostly Hot VW's, with a handful of VW Trends thrown in.
This box is still sitting in the same spot that I left it six years ago when
we first moved in!  If I haven't even touched these magazines in six years,
I suppose I really don't have any excuse for hanging on to them. :-)

So they're free to the first person who p-mails me (busdepot_at_email_dot_com), but
you have to pay the shipping cost. Figure $9 east of the Mississippi, $14
west. (Magazines are a bit heavy in quantities of 50.)  You can mail me a
check for the shipping cost, or I can run your credit card through The Bus
Depot. (If you pay by credit card, I'll charge you the $2 that the credit
card processing costs me; waived if you add it to a Bus Depot order.)
