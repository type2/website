sounds a tad high...

relay $7.95 bus depot, he is on crack here...

it would take me 1/2 hour to wire this up... so $30 if i was doing it
(this is assuming $60/hr)

rebuilt starter $74.95 bus depot, he is over double here...
i wouldnt guess more than a half hour labor, one hour max on this one..

this guy is taking you to the cleaners IMHO...
