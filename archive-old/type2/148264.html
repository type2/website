Subject: Re: [T2]Led Alarm Light

I don't know that it would help much. Some poor man's alternatives to
an alarm are a battery cut off switch or a fuel line cut off valve, or
if you have an electric fuel pump, a hidden switch.

&gt; How do i put one of these LED lights in just to possible detour thieves?(and
so it doesnt drain the battery? possibly on a toggle switch? maybe..? i have a
external battery for that if so? how much power can a LED light take anyways?
&gt; dont have the cash for the alarm but maybe hoped the blinking light would
detour them away or thin the crowd....? we got some folks breaking into cars
and hanging out around the vehicles late at night where i work...middle oof
city..... right now affording the alarm isnt possible but do not want my fears
to become a reality coming out of work one night...everything i worked for
gone /// over someones lack of responsibilites and choices.....
