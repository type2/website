Subject: FS: PNW - partial '70 Campmobile interior

If you're in the PNW and are building a Westfakia you might want to read on.

A couple years ago I had the pleasure of pulling a couple cabinets out 
of a '70 Westy.  Not in perfect shape, but definitely servicable.  I 
have: the blind spot cabinet (closet), the headache cabinet (overhead) 
and the seat/bed cabinet.  The latter piece has the bed hardware but not 
the bed itself. I also grabbed all the attaching hardware.

These pieces are taking up a major portion of the carriage house that 
passes for a garage at my 100 year old farmhouse.  If you're east of the 
Cascades, north of the Sugarloafs, south of the Canadian border and west 
of the Rockies, you might be interested....

Worth $35 to someone?
