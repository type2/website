&gt; MPC= multiprong connector.  I did the diagnostic test for terminal one
&gt; and it was ok.

I re-read your 1st message and you wrote:
&quot;Checked terminal one on the MPC and it has power- means coil trigger wire is
continuous and OK?.  Checked terminal 10 to 5, 17, 18 and there is continuity
so &quot;brain&quot; has ground.&quot;
You either checked the wrong wires or wrote down the wrong ones. They should
have been 10 and 5, 16, and 17.

&gt; The final flowchart I used said brain was bad if injectors didn't get
&gt; pulsed ground from brain.  However, I will check or swap resistors and
&gt; must check if injectors are getting continuous 12v, as the brain just
&gt; provides the ground signal?

You are misreading something here.  The pulsed signal test is B+ from terminal
1 on the coil. The test is to:
1) pull MPC off ECU
2) test light between term 1 and ground
3) crank engine, light should flicker or blink

The next test is the ground test:
1) ECU disconnected and MPC plug disconnected
2) test w/test light from terminals 10 and 5, 10 and 16, 10 and 17.
Test light lights up = bad ECU
Test light off = bad ground or open wire between term 10 and double relay term
88b

Ground is either on or off, NOT pulsed...

&gt;
&gt;  MPC?  What is that?
&gt;  The coil trigger wire comes from the #1 terminal of the coil. It should
&gt; pulse
&gt;  voltage when the points open and close. The injecters do not run
&gt; continously,
&gt;  they open when the points open. Terminal 1 on the ECU. It is a long
&gt; single
&gt;  white wire exiting the EFI harness about 6&quot; from the ECU plug.
