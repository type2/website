It was my bay window bus that Henry DeKuyper showed, along with a friend's 
Vanagon.  We both had the A/c units at Busses By The Arch.  Many of us here 
in the North Houston VW Club are doing this on our camping trips.  I have 
torn up the mount that I used in the '79, as it was built on the spot in St. 
Louis.  I decided to take that van because 3 days earlier, my Vanagon got 
hit on the right side and was undrivable, necessitating getting the '79 
roadworthy rather quickly!  Essentially, you have to build a ledge that will 
sit in the window opening of the door, and keep any weight off the glass and 
window stripping.  As I recall, I used a piece of furring strip both in and 
out, and a 1X4 tying it all together.  A piece of 3/4 plywood is then cut to 
larger than the window cutout and it rests on the threshold piece mentioned 
earlier.  That piece of plywood will be cut in an inverted &quot;U&quot; shape, and 
the AC unit mounted to the plywood, and setting on the threshold.  A tie 
down strap then goes from the rain gutter to the wheel lip and holds it 
against the body.  Feel free to email me for more information.
