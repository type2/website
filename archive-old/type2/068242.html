&gt; One of my Gurus is a man by the name of Colin Fletcher. (I hope)

Yeah....kinda the St John Muir of the backpacking crowd, in a way.

I don't know if he's still around -- I read The Complete Walker at
least 25 years ago. And for some reason, whenever I go into REI, I
have to buy a Kendall Mint Cake in his honor.  

Fletcher was big on self-sufficiency, and having the right tools for
the job.  His menu was a bit Hooveresque, though :)

See also &quot;The Man who Walked through Time&quot;, his journal of walking
from one end of the Grand Canyon to the other, in the early 60's when
Glen Canyon Dam was first built and Lake Powell was filling, and he was
the first to walk through some areas which had always been underwater.


Thanks for bringing him back....I'll have to go look for my copy.
