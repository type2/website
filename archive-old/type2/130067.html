Subject: Hearye, hearye! Bill Moon is a great guy.

Let it be known far and wide in the Bus-driving world:

I would like to take this occasion to nominate Bill Moon of Colonial Beach, 
VA as an honorary &quot;Elf of the Black Forest&quot; for helping me find a good vent 
wing window for my bus. He went above and beyond in finding, retrieving, 
packing and shipping the window, just because I mentioned on a previous 
post that I needed one. Thanks again, Bill.

Chris

&gt;Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt;The vent went out the other day by Parcel Post. The postage is 6.66. When I
&gt;took it out of the bus, I just set it aside and I didn't really look at it
&gt;until just before I sent it off. There is more rust than my initial
&gt;impression.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Anyway, if you decide that you can use it, go ahead and send me the
&gt;postage and if you can't use it, don't worry about it.
&gt;Bill Moon
