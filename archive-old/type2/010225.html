I see these in San Diego junkyards all the time, usually in mint 
condition. If someone who needs one would take theirs down to a Postal 
Plus or some such, and find out (a) how to package it and (b) how much it 
would cost to ship, I would be willing to keep my eyes open for screens 
which I would purchase and ship at cost.

But I am really bad at going to the post office and asking the right 
questions, as I am at a variety of administrative tasks (ask any of my 
students). So if you want a rust free screen, you'll need to figure out 
how to ship it and give me Murphy-proof instructions.
