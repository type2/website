Subject: Re: [T2] loose antenna

If i remember right, my antenna is held on by one small nut ( maybe 10 
mm) and one larger nut (maybe 15 mm). Not too hard to access without 
removing the glove box, easy to access if you remove the box. The larger 
nut is threaded on the same terminal that the antenna coax connects to. 
I recommend not removing the coax unless you absolutely have too. the 
threaded collar that held the coax cable to my antenna fell apart when I 
tried to remove it by hand. The cable is not very expensive to replace 
but all those pennies add up to lots of dollars when rebuilding a bus. 
Also, don't play Arnold when torqueing those nuts. The studs the nuts 
are on are threaded into cast aluminum or plastic, depending on the 
antenna you have. The aluminum does not seem to be of the highest 
quality, and plastic is plastic, so ONLY enough to snug it up so it wont 
come loose again. Maybe a drop of Loctight blue would help.
Hope this helps.
Tom
