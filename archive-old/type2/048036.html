Subject: [T2] Vanagon Alloy rims??

&gt;Its a 79' bus,with 205 70 r14 tires(which I'll be putting on these
wheels). Will I
&gt;have any clearance problems in my rear wheel wells?
&gt;Any info will be great

Not positive, but it seems to me I read somewhere you need extra long studs
to mount the Vanagon alloys on a bay. I saw a picture of yellow Westy with
Vanagon rims and I think they mentioned no clearance problems but mentioned
the expense of getting the studs from VW
Based on what 914 alloy length bolts cost, these may cost more then the
wheels.
