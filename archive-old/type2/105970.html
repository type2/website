Subject: 74 bus basically no idle

Kinda sounds like a vacuum leak I had... down just
above the tin towards the back (towards the front of
the bus) you will feel a metal line approx 1/2&quot;. On
both sides of the engine you will feel a rubber elbow
very close to the tin. The elbows crack and leak and
you realy cant see them you have to reach down and
back and find them by feel. I have had one go bad and
one pop off over the years.. each time the bus will
not idle but I can keep it running if I keep the revs
up.... Cant remember what the h*ll its called tho.
--------------------------------------Snip-----
74 bus with dual carb (Solex) 2L engine, built by
Kummetat with highcompression pistons (not sure if
they are flat top or dome top - it's the kind that
usually lives in a Porsche 914).On Christmas Eve my
bus started running poorly - missing on at least on
cylinder, especially at idle - basically no idle,
engine would die without keeping revs up. Around 3000
- 4000 RPM the problem seems to disappear (or is no
longer noticable).
