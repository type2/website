Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

&gt; &gt;I use a golf tee to plug off my lines when working.... May not be the most
&gt; &gt; recommended mechanical way, but it works.  Nary a drip.

My two comments on this:
1) If you use the needle nose vice grips, I have a pair with a 1 inch 
piece of fuel hose jammed over each tip of the pliers. It makes for a 
very soft pinch of the hose when clamping off and you can do it all 
one handed.

In a pinch, if you want to plug off the end of the fuel hose, I use a 
fuel pump pushrod. I have an extra I keep in the top of my tool box 
just for this reason (and I use it for a drift sometimes) and it 
works great. And I do clamp it once in. I once bumped a plug out and 
more than a gallon flowed before I could plug it again. Safety first. 
There are few second chances.
