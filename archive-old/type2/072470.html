I have a couple of questions for the list.....
1st) When I turn left with the van, I get a fuel spill out of the filling hole. Yes, there is a cap on it. When I turn right, I get a fuel spill somewhere out the left. WHat could be causing this??
2nd) Why after driving a while, there is smoke coming out of the dash, near the windshield? It smells like burnt motor oil, or other oils.
3rd) Does anyone have a complete dash, with steering wheel for sale in good condition for a 1973 bus??


Thanks to all in advance.....
