Subject: Re:Oily To Rise - multi-grade oils

Dave and the &quot;List&quot;,
   you said........&quot;.Here's my reasoning: Under operating load =
conditions the internal engine
temps are going to be relatively constant regardless of the external air
temperature, so if we need to run a heavier oil in the summer to cool =
and
lubricate our engines, shouldn't we also need that same protection in =
the
winter? Also, does the alleged wear at startup do more damage than the =
wear
caused by extended operation with a light weight oil?
Any theories, ideas, two bit opinions? &quot;

The trick is to understand the 2 different numbers in the designation of =
a multi-grade oil.  The first number is the viscosity at ambient =
temperatures.  In the case of 10w40 the oil has the properties of a 10 =
weight oil at ambient.  The second number designates the qualities of =
the oil at 100 degrees C.  So, at 100 degrees C, the 10w40 oil has the =
same viscosity a 40 weight oil would at 100 degrees C.  It's not that =
the 10w40 thickens with temperature, it's that it doesn't thin as fast =
as a straight weight oil does.  That is accomplished by the additives in =
the oil.   So, the multi-grade oil gives us the best of both worlds.  We =
can have thin for starting and at operating temperature still have the =
lubrication the same as a heavier grade.  Of course none of this applies =
for straight grade oils.   Hope this helps.
