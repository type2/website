Subject: [T2] '72 Parts Bus in Atlanta

We have a 1972 Bus that we need to get rid of.  I've used it for
some minor parts, but it still has all the major components:

engine (out, but intact)
tranny
gas tank
front seats
windows
suspension

We need to clear it out to make room for more 'toys'.  Contact
me at dburden_at_mindspring_dot_com if you are interested.

Thanks
Dave
