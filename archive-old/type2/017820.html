I'm completely re-doing my brake system currently (including e-brake)

But, in the past, I have used a tire block (cheap yellow $3 plastic
piece) W/ a rope tied to it.  I would put it under the drivers tire and
slowly pull away while I pull the block into the cab.  Works great w/ a
little coordination.  Always used it when launching a little sunfish.

2nd best - when parking by a curb, get real close to the curb and then
cut the wheels into the curb so the curb blocks the tire.

BTW
&gt;Does anyone have a seal for sale that would fit in my 71 bus?  Its for
&gt;the back window hatch.  The one i have now is falling apart.....thanx!
&gt;oh yeah...I live in wisconsin

Poor seal, hope he gets better.  Haven't seen any seals in the paper
lately, but don't get a walrus, I think they are too big.


&gt;In my old 71 Bus I carried a 2x4 cut to just the right length so I could
&gt;jam it against the brake pedal and wedge it under the front lip of my
&gt;seat-lets you move away from your brick, &quot;park&quot; it with stick, jump out to
&gt;get brick,  jump back in, remove stick, and take off!  BTW, I carried
&gt;pieces of 2x4.  If you use a foot long piece, you can kick it out away from
&gt;the wheel.
&gt;quoth Vandela and Al Brase:
&gt; My emergency brake is a brick. I carry it in the back of my bus. I just
&gt; stick it behind the back wheel when I park on an incline if there isn't a
 curb to turn the wheels against.

BTDT, but it sure is hard to get it out when you're by yourself (unless
you don't care about keeping it).:^(
