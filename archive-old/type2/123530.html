Subject: How do you know all this

How do some of you people out there know so much about fixing buses.
I have been busting my brain while trying to figure out this so called simple 
bus engine, and all the other parts of the bus.
I guess as far as I am concerned, it is harder to teach an old dog new 
tricks.  ( 41 years old)
