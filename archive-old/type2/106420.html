&gt; VW engineers know all this and they designed the tire sizes and gear

and I knew this and decided that I would forgo some rolling resistance to
get the better stability when I went to 205/70X14  the diameter is almost
exactly the same...

however my mpg goes up when I put the canoe on the bus!  cleans up the
aero dynamics more than the extra weight causes loss
