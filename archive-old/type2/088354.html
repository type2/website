Subject: Dual circuit brake  safety?

Chuck,
As far as I know all VW's (air cooled anyway) dual circuit systems are =
split front/rear.
On Bus's with disk brakes (~'71 on I think) there is also a pressure =
splitter/regulator to vary the pressure front to rear. This may also be =
linked in with the master cylinder to regulate pressure when one side of =
the dual brakes fail.
I'm not sure why you see what you do on the master cylinder on it's own, =
is something preventing full travel of the master cylinder?
Richard,
