&lt;&lt; and won't even keep the VDO oil switch off I get cautious. &gt;&gt;

If the one that you reference is an aftermarket sender it is probably a 
&quot;generic&quot; designed for a broad range of applications into which VDO includes 
the VW type 4 engines.  

I wouldn't_expect_their effort at maximizing aftermarket profit to result in 
a sender that matches the specs of the one the VW engineers deemed 
appropriate for this particular engine.

A check of the archives will probably result in a number of other posts from 
folks who have had the same activation threshold problem with aftermarket 
senders.  I would dare to suggest that the problem may actually be with the 
use of the sender and not the engine.
