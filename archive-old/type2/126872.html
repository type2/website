&gt; B/c of the close proximity to the engine (heat)? Inquiring minds want to know...

Perhaps, but the higher temperatures also means that moisture is driven
out of the muffler very quickly, leaving less chance of shutting down with
moisture still in the muffler.

I've had good life with Leibstritz mufflers, but I live where they don't
put salt on the roads.
