Subject: Sound from 73 bus engine (1700)

I recorded the sound I am getting from
my 73 engine..

http://jboothbee.tripod_dot_com/vwsound.wav

first on left side of engine,
then on right side of engine
then from top of engine compartment

hear the chirp?  I pulled the plugs on the
left side of the engine and it stopped making
the noise

it runs.  I have it parked until I find out what
the noise is..

what I think might be the source of the noise:

valves not sealing?
ring not sealing?
major leak somewhere?

heads were torqued according to manual.
gasket between head and cylinder
gasket between barrel and case
valves are adjusted correctly
