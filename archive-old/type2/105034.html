&gt; maybe I should just tell them to do whatever it takes to fix the oil leak
&gt; and leave it at that for now. but I think they wanted a fair amount of
money
&gt; just for that. about $700 for the re-sealing that head and reringing it to
&gt; kill the blow-by. (again, i may be confusing a few things here.)
&gt;
&gt; maybe, I should just fix what needs it and leave it at that for now, then
&gt; see what happens. I always want to be the good bus owner and do it myself,
&gt; or make sure its done right so myself and my wife/dog are always safe when
&gt; out travelling, but im not weathy either, this would all be going on the
&gt; danged credit card if I did it, so i dont want to just throw money away
&gt; either.

If the engine seems to be basically running soundly and with acceptable
power then I have to question whether it's worth $1,700 to deal with a
little puff of smoke in the morning and an oil leak.  That's a personal
judgment and different people will make different judgments based on their
own circumstances.  If you can afford to &quot;lay up&quot; the vehicle for a while,
and have the time and space and willingness, then I'd say try fixing it
yourself.  You could hardly end up spending any more money than $1,700.
