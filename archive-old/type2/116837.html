Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Sender Instl - Disaster Averted!

My engine case is tapped for M10-1.0.  I was thinking about opening up the 
hole in the cooling tin so that I could attach the P/N 360006 sender 
(M10-1.0 threaded) straight into the case (ala Steve Dolan), but I read 
about the problems with tightening up the sender without removing alot of 
the engine tin.  So, I decided to go the extension hose way.  The way I have 
it hooked up is this: M10-1.0 adapter threaded into the case, 1/8 NPT grease 
gun hose attached to the top of the adapter, 1/8 NPT union (coupler) 
attached to the other end of the hose, pressure sender attached to the 
union.  The only place the threads don't match is between the 1/8 NPT union 
and the P/N 360006 sender.  With a P/N 360009 sender (1/8 NPT threaded), 
there is no mismatch.

 &gt;My FLAPS had a 1/8 NPT female to M10-1.0 male adapter for the
case and a 12 inch grease gun hose (1/8 NPT threaded) to attach to it.

 &gt; If you decide to install this set-up, you may want to pick up
a P/N 360009 VDO pressure sender (with idiot light contact; about $28) that

has a 1/8 NPT thread on it and will mate better with the 1/8 NPT union on
the hose.  The P/N 360006 sender sold at VW outlets in M10-1.0 threaded.

Yes this is exactly the type of story I was wanting to hear about. I am
also pleased to know that Iam not crazy and that someone else has NPT
threads in their case! I used a dremel tool to open the hole in the
shrouding to accept the new sender. Problem is that the sender I bought has
the metric threads. So I am going to order the correct threaded sender
(Aircooled_dot_net has them). The only other beast is that in order to properly
tighten the new sender I will need to remove the fan housing to get an open
end wrench in there. Not looking forward to doing that...

BTW just how much of a PITA is removing the fan housing with the engine in
the bus? (Type  IV of course)
