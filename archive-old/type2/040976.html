&gt;  I took my 82 Westy on her first long run this past weekend and I wonder if

&gt; maintain about 65 mph, which is what I like to cruise at.  I checked the
&gt; archives and it seems that on the hiway, I should get 22-25 mpg. On my old
&gt; 73, I got 19 mpg with a 1800 with a single Weber carb.

I have never gotten much better than about 20 down hill with a tail wind,
2l with FI in a 78, your 82 is heavier, and the Westy interior adds to it.

&gt;  So am I panicking, or should I be getting better gas mileage??

your probably pretty close to what you should be getting, maybe a little
more but not much, how was the wind that day, that can effect gas milage
too
