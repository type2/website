Subject: Re: [T2] tranny whine

--Stevo,

Same noise on my '65 when I bought it. 4th gear only, only while throttle open.

This is the suck part. I bought a new tranny and put it in. Noise went away.

As I understand it, whines/growls are tranny going bye-bye. Have you tried a fluid change as a cheap/easy first step?

Billy
