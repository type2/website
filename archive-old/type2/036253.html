Subject: FI Hose Diagram

Does anybody know where i can find a good diagram for the hose system of a 76 
2lit. with EGR? I have looked all over and found a few incomplete diagrams, 
and a few complete wiring diagrams. They have helped a little, in confusing 
me more.
       I have been working on putting this engine together since late 
December (weekend play project), and and am at the point of frustration with 
the hoses. My friend (who's engine it is) took it all apart without even 
looking to see what goes where. Also, he didnt notice what missing components 
were gone and where the blocked hoses went. Since we searched his house up 
and down for the Deceleration Valve and cant find it, i figure that was cut 
out of the system. There are also a few other unexplained modifications, 
under the charcoal filter where it goes to the exhaust is pinched off, and a 
light bulb is wedged in a hose that i have no idea where it would fit.
   Thanks for listining to my ramble. I guess to only important part of this 
is the first few lines, but if anybody has any insight as to the logic of 
this system (or lack there of) I would greatly appreciate some words.
