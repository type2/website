Subject: Re: [T2] brake plate

&gt; http://www.bus-boys_dot_com has a lot of those brake parts, but they are closed until the 14th.
&gt; It sounds like you need a brake backing plate, but you'd better be sure. Ask him to clarify.

I see that bustedbus_dot_com has 71-79 backing plates according to the
website. used, cheaper and likely better made than a repro.
