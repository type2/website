Subject: Advice and part needed - Crossover pipe for 77 bus / need heat !
Message-ID: &lt;e6948ce7.252a3abe_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hey folks,

I'm really digging for some help on hooking up the heat in my 77 westy.  My 
heat exchangers are completly shot and rusted.  I can get the new heat 
exchangers but no one carries the crossover pipe ( sort of j shaped ).  It is 
a salvage Item.

I am not having much luck salvaging one of these....anyone out there that can 
help I would be eternally greatful and can trade parts or cash ?

Also while searching across the archives I came across a post that claims the 
complete exhaust can be replaced and then the crossover piece is not needed.  
I need some help here in understanding what I need to purchase and replace to 
make this work.  This post was by Ron from the bus depot...

Real men don't need heat, but it sure helps !

Thanks 
Robert
