Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump bad?/gas tank blocked solved!

    I got more out of the fuel tank baffle box using the steel flex gas 
propane line (5/8&quot;- 3 ft piece) and a vac (set to both blowing and 
sucking)-works great as you can get it in there at any angle and bend 
(even to reach the far left of the tank) and it will keep its shape. I'm 
sure I got all that was loose;  Sitting it to blow I didn't see any more 
flying around.
    Based on the tan color it seems someone coated the bottom (or 
edges?) of the baffle box and it peeled off!  Got pieces 3&quot;x 1.5&quot; big! I 
think this came out of a 77 parter....I'd much rather deal with rust 
silt, as it usually does not block the opening....grrrrr to the mechanic 
who I don't think really looked in the baffle box (One CAN see in it by 
sighting down the sender hole).  Tells me if you want to get it done 
right, do it yourself!

  hey Mike  another adavtage of a tee is that yoyu can drain any water off
  and also if need any gas for generator or lawn motors and such.  I can't
  for the life of me figure out what that stuff in your tank could be and
  how did it get there.  later  mark d
