Subject: pancake parts for sale

folks-

I still have a good number of parts
to sell/trade out of my 81 Vanagon.

most of the engine and related accessories,
as well as the 3 way kitchen unit and
dashboard gear. The engine internals
would be great for someoen rebuilding
a 2L.
 
I'd really like the bigger stuff to vanish
sooner rather than later...

thanks
matt
