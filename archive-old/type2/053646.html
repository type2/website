&gt; Once adjusted, the old bars are over-stressed and more likely to break.
&gt; Twenty-year-old bars which have not yet broken are not likely to do so if

here's a good example of &quot;mechanic's wisdom&quot; that doesn't seem to pan out
in real life.  I've never seen a bus torsion bar that has broken due to
being reset.  Nothing in the official VW literature mentions this
&quot;problem&quot;, including the instructions on how to reset the bars.  They _do_
warn about not swapping the bars from side to side, so they did consider
possible failure modes while writing the instructions.

A saggy bus actually puts slightly more static load on the torsion bars
than a bus that is properly adjusted.  The only point where properly
adjusted bars will be more highly stressed than saggy bars is at the fully
bottomed position, and then by only a couple of degrees.

The only broken torsion bars I've seen have been on Baja bugs as a result
of cranking in a lot of preload and then using them for severe off-road
abuse.  You won't be doing this in a bus.

Go ahead and reset the bars yourself.  A mechanic who is not inclined to
do the job won't do the job well.  It's not hard, just time-consuming
(another reason that mechanics don't want to do the job).

If you Mickey-Mouse it with coil-over shocks, you risk damage to the shock
towers, which is far worse than a broken torsion bar.
