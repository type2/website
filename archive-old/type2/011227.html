Subject: Re: Leaded gas
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have heard this argument about unleaded vs. leaded
heads for so long I forget when it first surfaced.

I have a 1973 Beetle (I know, not a bus, but the same
engine as in the early post split Type 2s), and have
owned it since brand new.  My mom bought it off the
lot, and nothing was done to the engine until 1993. 
Leaded gas was phased out of my area of the US in
around 1983/84, and we switched the bug over to
unleaded gas with no problems, using no additives.  It
was a daily driver for my mom from the time it was new
until I turned 16, then she gave it to me and it was a
daily driver for me until I took it off the road to
restore it in 1993.  I would guess that the original
engine had 200k miles on it when I got it (it was my
family's only car for about 5 years), and I put
another 75k on it in the eight years that I drove it
daily(I lived about 45 miles one way from high
school).  We didn't have a single problem with
unleaded gas.  

So what's the big deal about no lead?  I have read
that the lead helped to lubricate the pistons (or was
it the valves?), but the engine ran quite strong when
I got it and could have probably gone longer if I
wasn't into rebuilding every single thing on it when I
restored it.  No cracks in the block, had it checked
out and ended up using it for my rebuild, still runs
strong today.

Paul
