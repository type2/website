&gt;Well, you're still going to run into a problem - nobody knows what AFR 
&gt;numbers yield the good smog results -- 

I know what numbers will yield good %CO numbers but I won't know the HC and NOx levels so I'll have to watch the head temps as well and see if there is any predictability. I've got the 75-78 EGR setup so it's going to dump in a lot of exhaust mid-throttle and richen up the mixture to cool things down.

I'll need to run a few setups to see how the numbers are effected.

&gt;and you also need to simulate the 
&gt;same conditions as the dyno.

I'm going to drive around with the meter hooked up and then dump the logs to the computer. I'll take the same route at the same time of day, same temp etc. I'm hoping this cold weather will favor good test results.

&gt; Seems like what you'd really want to do is 
&gt;go to a service station, have them hook up your bus to the dyno and ask 
&gt;them to tune the AFM so the bus will pass (I spent 100 bux on this last 
&gt;time).  If your bus is in descent working condition, you should have no 
&gt;problem getting it to pass.  I had a *crappy* engine on mine with a 
&gt;badly tuned AFM and they still got it to pass.  Then, while the bus is 
&gt;still on the dyno, hook up the WB02 sensor and see what values it reads.

The mercedes shop down the road offered me some time on their smog tester but I never took them up on the offer. I'll see them again and would like to verify my numbers to see if they result in low HC and NOx levels as well.

&gt;you can use testers on multiple cars.  There are testers that attach to 
&gt;the pipe if I remember correctly.  My friends had one and they were 
&gt;hooking it up to their cars and driving around with it.

I've been looking for information to determine sensor accuracy when at the tailpipe vs. the header. Do you have any information? I'm planning to have a bung welded on where it's about 500F.
