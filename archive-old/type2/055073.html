Dear list

	I have been wanting to put on an aux heater inside my 74 sportsmobile.  I
live in indian and it gets pretty  cold during the winter. What kind of
heater do you guys recommend.  I've heard that a lot of the gas heaters
start fires so idon't thing i want one of those.  Does anyone know of a
good aftermarket heater that i could install or just hard wire into my bus.
Thanks Jason
