   Jersey City (ever read &quot;Clockers&quot;...?-), NJ put a new twist
in auto theft by the local police...When the bad apples saw
a car they liked, they put a ticket on it and had it towed to
the impound lot...What they didn't do was inform the owner
of the impound (a little collusion with the violations dept.)
When the car came up for auction, guess who had a really,
really low highest bid... ;-(
