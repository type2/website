&gt; Alrighty ...
&gt; 
&gt; It has become clear to me that finding a roof rack for a '74 Bus is
&gt; difficult ... and when one is found, it's expensive.  So, I've decided
&gt; that I want to make one myself.

A noble objective, although you might want to consider the time
involved.  My full length rack has 94 brazed joints in it that all had
to be jigged and lined up correctly!  I had considered building racks
as a minor business venture, but decided that I'd have to charge $1k
for a rack to recoup my time!

&gt; Only problem is that I don't know where I should start.  Should I use
&gt; piping?

The material in mine is 3/4 inch OD thinwall tubing, similar to
electrical conduit.  Electrical conduit will work, but I really
wouldn't want to braze on galvanized material, which emits nasty
fumes.  

Where do I secure it?  I found 4 screws midway up the side of the
&gt; bus ... is it okay to tap into this?  Should I drill through the
roof and
&gt; use bolts?

My rack has six rubber-padded feet that sit in the drip rail.  Next to
the front and rear feet on each side are sheet-metal hooks that engage
under the drip rail and hold the rack on.  I've seen racks that attach
to the roof, and even racks welded to the drip rails (gad!).  The drip
rails are the &quot;hardest&quot; part of the top of the bus.  If you attach to
the roof itself, you have to find out where the structure is under the
roof skin so you can take advantage of it.
