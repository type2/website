&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has put 
&gt; some miles on Red-line or another synthetic trans oil.  Any troubles?  
&gt; 

Hello Guys   I have a bunch of buses running synt. tranny fliud  . I have 
been using Mobil and it works great  .  Last year there was a bunch of talk about 
not using it in new trannys as it was too slippery or some such crap. two 
years ago I put in a new tranny in my 59 panel that I use for the swap meets and 
put in the synt mobil . Have not had the first bit of problems out of it and I 
have driven that thing loaded for over 8 hours at a time at 70 mph , and when 
I say loaded it is really loaded including the full lenght roof rack. later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
