&gt;I think that more of the problem is that the hand brakes aren't as
&gt;effective as they should be.  You really need them to be in good shape.
&gt;
&gt;George Lyle

One thing to keep in mind is that each state and even each county within
each state have their own regulations as far as vehicle inspections. Some
places have full inspections of the vehicle, not as bad as like the TOV, but
an inspection. Other places have none at all. I can go to Oregon, registar a
car that the DMV never sees. I have taken a title to them and them given me
plates and they do not know the the car is disasembled in my Garage. Most
state have some kind of emissions checks in and around big cities, but may
not be required in the rest of the state.
  So no one will ever check the E-brake on my Bus, or Bug. I can drive
around with no E-brake if I wanted. This is one reason that there are lots
of old Buses and Bugs still driving around the US in poor shape. As long as
when the driver turns the key, it goes, he will keep driving.
  I have worked for 12 years as a Mechanic and have seen so scary stuff.
