Subject: Re: 76 westy No start after long trips???

&gt; I would recommend using the Bosch from bus depot.  my
&gt;  jeep uses a ford ignition switch for starting purposes
&gt;  and it is a royal PIA.  every old jeep ive owned i
&gt;  think ive always replaced them at least 2X because
&gt;  they go bad and dont function right. 

I second this.  I have a Mustang that (of course) uses these little &quot;gems&quot; 
that I have replaced, oh goddess, about a half dozen times plus for dying in 
myriad and nasty ways... This in a car I've owned for under a year.  Yeah.  
Real doo-doo.  I swear, Ford must have designed these solenoids to either fry 
or weld points just to generate profit.  Even at $21 a piece, that's $120 for 
a part that shouldn't die. Oh, I'm not counting 2 batteries, 2 sets of 
cables, and 3 starters, all ground down to death (or melted down) because of 
the points welding in the solenoid.

Even G.M. has a better track record than these nightmares in a can!  I like 
Ford, but I can't stand this!

Go Bosch.  They work.
