Subject: RE: Flywheel System Logic (was Eric Rainey)

Just an example of what kind of energy is stored in a flywheel - my 1600 sp 
seized this spring and when we tried to remove the flywheel it took us over 
an hour to pry it off.....the round holes in the center where the plugs go 
were oval!  Crankshaft stopped, flywheel then released its stored energy. 
 The fly wheel is scrap me thinks.

just my 2 cents...
