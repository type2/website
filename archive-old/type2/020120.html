Subject: Not Getting Enough Fuel at Highway Speeds

I have a 1600 dp with dual single barrel Webers and an electric fuel
pump all installed by the previous owner.  I can drive the bus around
town all day with no problems; however, after three miles on the
highway, it starts to stall.  When I stop and check the engine, the
plastic fuel filter looks empty.  When I just turn the ignition on, I
can see the fuel filter slowly start to fill.  Once the filter is full,
I start the engine and take the first exit and head home at 30 mph with
no problems.  I hoped it might be a tank venting problem; however, the
same thing happens when I drive with no gas cap.

Is there anything I should try before I assume my electric fuel pump is
starting to fail?  If it's the pump, can anyone recommend a brand and
source for a new electric pump?

Thanks,

Andrew Stockton
