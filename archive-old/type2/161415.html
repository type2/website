Subject: Gear ratio calclator

Listees --  this may be a site everyone already knows about
but it was new to me.

Found this website for calculating kph (or mph) per 1000 rpm
plus more.  The download is free and works with standard tyre
sizes -- won't accept 185R/14 as a size -- but will allow you to
enter the tyre diameter as an alternative.
Calculator also provides kph for each gear a maximum rpm ( I entered
5000 rpm) plus will tell you what rpm you will see in all 4 gears in  
10 kph
increments -- not sure of the result in mph
