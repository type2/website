Subject: More 71 rear bar stuff

List,

While gathering info for this 71 bus engine, i have learned that there may be
beetle cases that can be drilled and tapped for the rear bar.
This is cool.

I have also learned tentatively that i may not be able to run the full-flow
oil pump cover because it won't clear the rear bar.
Any thoughts?

thanks,
clark
