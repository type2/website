&gt;Carrying extra fan belts is not a good option.  I had the same problem

&gt;Remember that if your friend goes with the longer 38 amp generator he will 
&gt;need the 38 amp regulator.  Maybe he should consider switching to an 
&gt;alternator with a built in regulator.  That's what I've got in my bus 
&gt;now.  Bright headlights all the time.

&gt;Bye the way, how did you make out with your accident in Alaska?
==========================&gt;
I start welding in new tin today !!!!!

Casper is getting all new right rear tin piece that is absolutely rust free 
and still has original donor factory paint still on in good shape,
and
Casper is getting a brand new battery tray welded in at same time.

I am getting ready to start in about an hour from now.
