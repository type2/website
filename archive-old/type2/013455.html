Hi Erik,

I wonder how long Type IV parts like pistons and
cylinders will be available from South America,
especially given the fact they don't use them down
there?  I also wonder which T4 parts are getting the
most rare (cases, cranks,...)?  Also, do the water
cooled vans have air conditioning, and are these buses
bays or bricks (Vanagons)?

It's hard to follow Maude's advice when it comes to
vans...&quot;here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get too
attached&quot; referring to the VW bug she just swiped. 
Even though VWs may not be as reliable or safe as I
would like, I love having a couple around.  I guess
&quot;consistency is not really a human trait&quot;.  Loved that
movie (Harold &amp; Maude)!

Rob
