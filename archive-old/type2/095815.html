Subject: Bay seats

I will need to have the seats in 1970 westy replaced. I've read from the
list that many of you have been able to replace the stock ones with newer
ones which I've been told are more ergonomic - especially on long trips.
I've heard Vanagon seats will work and even heard of one person puttin' in
Porsche 924 seats, and Celica seats. I just want to get some feedback on
what others have done so that when I meander to the local salvage yard - I
know what my options are without have to make any serious mods to the rails
etc. Can anyone give me some feedback?
