I read some concerns about busses bursting into flame because
of fuel lines getting old and leaky.

Do you have to pull the engine to get to the fuel pump (particularly
on a '69) ((no I have look myself even though I spend a lot of time 
under the bus))

no.     its attached to the motor if you have an upright motor.   check yr
muir book for a visual explanation.

What would have to happen in order to get a fuel line guaranteed
not to ever explode the bus, killing me and my family and everybody 
the the cars around us?  How can I inspect this?

DONT PANIC    

replacing the fuel line with the motor in place is a RPITA,  so your choices
are

1)dont worry, be happy   it probably wont happen anyway.   and if the line
goes, itll just pour out under the bus, which will be embarrassing, but not
explosive, until someone throws their cig butt out the window, which is
illegal in most states anyway.   and i saw some old geezer in a big american
car cruising up I 5 with his gas cap off, and it was sloshing out in to the
road at every little bump (must have just filled up).  and i waved and
honked, but he drove facing straight ahead, steadfastly ignoring the helpful
citizen in the old VW trying to avert catastrophy.   i honked quite a bit
actually.    and pointed at the gas pouring out.   he wouldnt even look.   it
was funny

2)  replace fuel line with motor in bus

3)  pullmotor and replace fuel line.  realise that it is now a good idea to
do a bunch of other maintenace too, and you wont get away that easy.  ha ha
hoo hoo  heeee heeeee

4)or even,  lie under busand visually &amp;manually check  gas line before
replacing it.

if you do pull the line, remember you will get a shower in petrol (xSarah).
   to avoid that, use vise grips to hold the line until you drail the tank in
to a can .

also, insist on the appropriate braided line.  the black rubber stuff has the
wrong inner diameter.........

i hope you feel safe now.
