Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Want the valve cover gaskets to last ?--
Not get sucked in, slide, move or leak again?

Apply a coat of High Tack to the cover side of the gasket--and on the
cover---

Let it set up--and stick the gasket on the cover.
It won't move as your putting the cover on and won't leak--

I get the idustrial grade High Tack from Caterpiller---the best stuff
ever for problimatic areas such as this--

My Vanagon's as well as my Type 2 all have this treatment--and no leaks.
It took care of this problem once and for all.
Later,

Terry

I think I may need new gaskets, but it's only been about a year since
these were brand-new. Is this the typical service life of gaskets, or
should they last longer?
My 914-4 sucks valve cover gaskets almost everytime I autocross it. The
gaskets deform and suck in along the bottom edge and oil poors out (I've
never glued my gaskets). I have the same problem on my bus, but not
nearly as often. One possible cause of sucking gaskets is insufficient
crankcase ventilation.
I always thought VW's design on the type IV motor valve covers was
pretty half-assed. If they'd put TWO tabs on each side instead of the
one in the middle it would have taken care of the problem once and for
all.
