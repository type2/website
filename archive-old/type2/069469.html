        Martha, sheesh! No water in a hot wilderness area??? No good
SHOES??? Geez I'd miss you!!!
        Next to not burning-down yourself, your wheels or the forest,
carrying enough water is the most important thing to remember. You need
a gallon a day when its hot, (more for showers :) )and three days without 
water can KILL you.
