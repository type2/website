Subject: 77 bus shift rod bushings

Hi folks,

	I can't seem to find answers to my exact questions in the library or
archives so I've come to you for help.
The shifting in our 77 was getting really sloppy and needing attention and
parts.  I've got a kit with all the new bushings but the Bentely manual says
that you have to remove the rear shift rod to replace it's bushings, and
that you need to remove the engine/transmission to get the rod out.  Well I
don't have a garage to work in, and the temperatures are in the 20s with a
howling wind.  I really, really don't want to drop the drive train if I can
help it.  So I ask, is there anyway possible to replace the 2 bushings on
the rear shift rod without removing it from the vehicle?  If not, would I be
wasting my time to just replace the bushing at the front of the forward
shift rod and the coupling at the transmission?
	I'm anxiously awaiting all tips, hints, tricks, magical
incantations, and advice you can send my way.
