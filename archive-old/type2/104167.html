Subject: Re: [T2] Westy cabinet use

While living/traveling out of my '71 weekender
(non-pop westy) for five months, we geared up in this
way:

* Under the rear bench seat: oil, tools and spares.
* Slot behind driver's seat: all manuals and maps
* Under the back jump seat: stove, propane, pots and
dishes.
* Closet: coats, frisbees.
* Shelf atop closet: TP, binoculars, tin foil.
* Overhead shelf: pillows, blankets.
* Rear pantry: chains, tent, souvenirs, emergency
stuff.
* Spice rack: headlamps, matches, candles, little
crap.
* In custom center console up front: CD's, more CD's.
* On the floor: large plastic bin of food, cooler,
crate of shoes.
* In the rear: chairs, clothes duffles, sleeping bags.
* On a diagonally strung clothesline: towels.

The key was to keep everything clean, packed and
moveable at all times. At night we'd fold out the bed
and store all the unnecessary stuff up front. In
cities we could stow everything loose in back under a
blanket out of sight (dark tinted windows). I imagine
that five months isn't what VW had in mind for the
&quot;weekender&quot; edition, so I bet that having the bunk up
top would make life much easier.

Cheers,
