Subject: Update on Jessica&amp;Craig en route to the redwoods

&gt; Got a 10 pm call from Jessica and Craig just now (Wednesday, April 10th)- their email of trip plans
&gt; came through the list just this morning...

	&lt;snip&gt;

I've been in communication with Jessica over the last few days as I'm
heading up the coast in my '71 bus (en route to Sacremento where I
hope to pop a new head on my engine).  

They've been having a couple of different problems, from not being able
to get the bus in gear (fixed by adjusting the clutch) to the bus not
pulling them up hills. They got as far as Arroyo Grande yesterday and a
couple of us drove down from San Luis Obispo to help them out and take a
look at what's going on.

It looks like what's happening is their clutch is slipping.  Getting 
under the bus and looking at where the tranny and engine mate up
revealed a lot of oil dripping out of the bell-housing, so it looks like
either their front engine seal or their rear (RIR) tranny seal is blown
and the clutch disk is soaked with oil. 

So, I adjusted their fan belt (it was loose and still is a little loose
but there were no more shims to remove), adjusted their points (loose),
told them they should get a new engine seal (the horizontal engine seal
is non-existant) and said that they should check their tranny fluid
level and replace their clutch &amp; main seal ASAP.  The bus is drivable
at 1/4 throttle -- the clutch doesn't seem to be slipping at that point --
so I was able to drive the bus from AG to SLO with no problem.  It's a 
new and very strong engine, but the folks who installed it for them 
seem to have forgotten some details.

Anyway, they're on their way north still and were in Morro Bay 2 or so
hours ago.  I think they'll be ok, but keep an eye out for them.

Peace,
	tom
