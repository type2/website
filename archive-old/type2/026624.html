Greg,

	You really should get some type of multimeter for VW work.  It does
not have to be an expensive one though.  Radio Shack and discount stores
etc. sell multimeters for under $20 and up.  Any meter is probably fine if
it measures voltage and resistance, if it also measures current that is a
plus but this feature would probably be rarely used.  

	If you want to spend even less money you can get a little tester
light from a home center or hardware store (I think I paid about $1.79 for
mine).  Make sure it is one that works at 12V dc.  When connected across a
12V source the little light comes on.  Use the tester to test between the
two wires to ensure you have power (light comes on) then try from each wire
to a chasis ground to see which one lights (that is the 12 V hot wire and
the other is ground).

Pmail for further details, if needed.
