Subject: piston weights

So, I weighed a spare replacement piston that stan sent me (cuz my other
one's got a hole in it) and it was 1.2 ouces lighter than my others.  Is
that going to make a big difference?  and yes, they both had wrist pins,
c clips, and rings.

Otherwise, I guess I'll just use this one temporarily to pass smog and
then put a new set of P&amp;Cs on.

Thanks,
MIke
