Subject: RE: [T2] Koni shock bulk purchase

&gt;From: Richard Atwell

&gt;I will not be collecting money from list members. Nor will you be comitting
&gt;yourself to a purchase or eternal Type 2 blacklisting. :-)

&gt;I simply need a genuine list of names to generate enough interest at the
&gt;Koni distributor I bought my rears from to place the order once Koni agrees
&gt;to production.

&gt;Are there any vendors interested in helping out with this effort? Pmail
&gt;please...


Richard,

I can not vouch for myself this year I really do not see it happening, even 
though my bus needs a rear shock too, one has been missing since I got it. 
But I plan on having this bus on the road in the near future and fully 
getting to know her. The need for the best shocks I can find will come after 
I am confident in some of the other major areas. I still need and want to 
build a new engine to replace the refreshed GEX that is in there now. So I 
definately can not commit to any purchase. But there is definately a full 
bodied &quot;interest&quot;, especially if they are so unavailable. If this 
constitutes a placement of my name on a &quot;list of interested&quot;, then count me 
in. Kudos to you sir and your investigative mind set to find what we need, 
that we may not find. I wish that you had an Automatic bus and were more 
inclined to find some of the parts that are NLA or CBF.


Thanks,

Michael Knight
