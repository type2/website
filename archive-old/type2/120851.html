Subject: Re: [T2] Re: bus instrumentation (alternate version)

Ummm, I realize that everyone has their own ideas about gauge face
beauty, but wouldn't it be a lot easier to match the bus OE gauge
needles to the VDOs rather than the other way around? 

---&gt; For certain but I find the orange needles to be less than pleasing. I like those white needles. 

And since we're talking gauge fun and games - has anyone in bus land
ever snagged the triple VDO gauge package out of the early to mid-'80s
Audi 4000/5000s and used them?  And if so, how do they look compared to
the VDO Cockpit style?  

---&gt; Should be easy as they are standard 2&quot; VDO gauges - right? 

---&gt;Not in my bus, but maybe in my Beetle I plan to look into a &quot;custom&quot; set of instruments. A friend owns a kit-car business and has a supplier who can built instruments with any face he wants. In this case he had a set that looks very much like Porsche Speedster. Generic instruments (good ones though, don't know which supplier), custom faces. 

---&gt;I MUCH like the back lit gauges that VDO sells (though i do not know which &quot;series&quot; they are) which lights the numbers and needle and nothing more... It's only money - right?
