Subject: I have two screws loose!

Volks -

Itch has a '71 DP doghouse motor.

I noticed that the screws holding the coil on were loose - way loose.
Attempts to tighten the screws produce no results.

What's on the other side of the tin to hold the screws? I'm thinking just to
go oversize on the screws.

Help?
