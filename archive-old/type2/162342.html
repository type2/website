&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyone seen any Splittie Deluxes for sale recently...
&gt; &gt;&gt;I like the looks of the split windshield and those skylights.  Wondering
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've often wondered if those skylights (standee windows) could be put in a
&gt; &gt; bay....
&gt;
&gt; I've thought about adding similar features to my '80 Vanagon but don't
&gt; think it would work very well.
&gt;
&gt; ...a bay is close enough it might.

now to find a bunch of windows in decent shape and some decent seals...
