I currently have my propane tank out, so it can be
retrofitted with an OPD (aka Overfill Protection
Device).  (I hope.)

This really bothers me. 
Is there a reason you believe you need an OPD??
Is the local propane supplier telling you to get one??
ALL permanently mounted horizontal tanks HAVE an overfill pipe in them 
to limit the amount of liquid you can put in.
If they are telling you that you need it, they need to read the law.

Have him READ the 2nd paragraph here:
