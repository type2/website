Subject: travelin' busless (longish)

Hi Folks,

Well I sure got Murphyed this time around. Going to take a major trip
without the Westy. What a hollow feeling. Here's some of the hi/lo lites

 bus did not like sitting around out in the weather for a year and a half,
it just sucked up decay and problems, especially brakes, right out of the
ground.

Mice had a little fun too

Does it go without saying that somewhere along the line you order a part
over the phone, they say it's in stock will be shipped today it doesn't
arrive for 10 days you call back they tell you it was back ordered then say
they were sure that someone contacted you about the B.O.....more like B.S.

Will I ever get my core refund back?

Mindset adjustment from* if it aint broke don't fix it* to *that doesn't
look quite right clean/adjust/repair/replace*  sure changes the time line thing

And ofcourse as a self-employed artisan the work comes rolling in just when
I needed time more then money.

So next fri,it's off to the S.W. the high country, 4 corners, Santa Fe,
Anisazi and all of that. I know I'll be deeply inspired and the pleasure
will be great.... but we will be traveling in the Festiva (some consulation
in that, people say how can you travel in that thing, it's not a car it's an
appliance) not the bus so there will be some thing missing and it aint going
to be the same.... not even near the same

We'll probably still mosey along not on the interstates... US20Iowa
US30Nebraska  US83 down to US40Kansas and Colorodo finish up on CO94 to Co
Springs then just drive around and camp and take it all in

So if your from around any of these places and you're in your bus and
wondering why a middle aged couple in a dumb looking little white car with
Wisconsin plates is giving you the big wave.....it's us and you'll know why.

And if I see a splittie, loaf or even a late model brick ;) down on the side
of the road I'm going to try and be the first one to stop and lend a hand. :) 

See ya on the road

Len and Jan
