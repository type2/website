Subject: Shoreline (WA) VW Show

Went up to the VW show yesterday and met a few list people.  It seems like
every year there are more and more list folks up there, or maybe just more
people joining.  I met Rusty VanBondo and Jim Sherwood by name, and there
were a few others that I overheard talking about the list, but I didn't go
up and talk to them, for no other reason than I was in a hurry to leave as
I had to be somewhere else by a certain time.

I bought a list sticker (type2_dot_com) from Jim and spoke with Rusty about a
tent for my '81.  I also picked up 4 mostly good, althought with minor
dings, hubcaps.  I hate the plastic wheel covers that come with some of
the early Vanagons, the chrome hubcaps look so much better.  Now I need to
paint the wheels.  Oh, and I picked up a pair of pedal pads (is there a
correct term for these?). 

I was a little dissapointed at the lack of loafs, but it was a vintage
meet so I guess I shouldn't complain.  Last year there was a killer '74
for sale, exact same options and color as my '74, although in a million
times better shape.
