Since no one else has mentioned this, as far as I can tell....I'm in digest
mode, here's my $0.02. This happened to my 71 the first few times I tried
to drive it after the restoration. Turned out to be the old brake lines had
collapsed internally. You could apply the brakes just fine. They just
wouldn't release. Installed new flex lines and it was like having new
brakes again. I could finally tell that the booster was working as well.
Cheap, easy fix. Even if it doesn't solve your immediate problem, it's
still a good idea to replace them. Hope this helps.
