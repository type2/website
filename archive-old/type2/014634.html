Greetings---
	What is the conventional wisdom on re-torquing Type IV cylinder heads?  My
'77 motor will be out for clutch work soon, but I've received differing
opinions on whether or not to try it.  This is a high-mileage, absolutely
unmolested 2.0 with good compression that runs great.  I'm of the &quot;if it
works, don't mess with it&quot; school, but would appreciate any opinions.  Thanks!

Matt Q.  '77 Westfalia
