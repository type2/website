Subject: Longblock

I tried the archives but received a access denied so,
Can someone suggest a place to purchase a longblock for my 72 westy. You
might have read that it threw a rod when I fired it up after it had been
sitting for 2 years or so. I thought about using a upright I have but it
seems more involved than a simple switch. We have decided to weigh the
options of longblocks. We are looking for the best, least expensive option,
any suggestions.
Thanks in advance.
