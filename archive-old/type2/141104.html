Subject: Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

I had the windshield replaced in my 78 because of a crack in the driver's 
side - the guy had a little plastic tool and slipped it under the rubber and 
popped the window right out - they used the string technique to reuse the 
old seal and popped the new one back in - no problem ... took 20 mins.

 Over the years I must have put 20 pieces of glass into my 60 - all smallish 
and flat pieces of glass - I think I had 3 break - so 3/20ths of the easiest 
glass to pop-in - so I would never try to put a windshield into my 78 - the 
cost of paying the glass guy $50 or so is just much cheaper than breaking an 
old windshield - then trying to find another - then paying someone to put 
the second one in (or possibly the third :) ) and replacing the rubber seal.
