Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Scales Good News

Yup, $40, but hey, it's better than the &quot;eaten in half by the fan
pulley&quot; one I have in my spare parts bin now.   Can't time my bus
reliably unless I go borrow one from the repair shop, and they're very
picky about lending it out.  

I just file it under &quot;Things I'll only have to buy once for the bus&quot;.
