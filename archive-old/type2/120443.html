Subject: Re: [T2] RE: voltage regulator toasted UPDATE

Just so I know the readings I get make sense.... I checked the triple
plug wires and they gave me virtually no resistance (.05 &amp; .06 from 3
tests per wire on the lowest setting on the meter). This tells me those
wires are fine. Right? Then, I put one sensor on the plug that has the
blue wire connected to it and the other sensor to ground. I got an 
infinite resistance reading (or I couldn't cue it in on my meter). If
the other end of the circuit (the dash) is B+ and not ground, the only
way I would have gotten resistance would be if there was a short. Is
that right? Was this a valid and adequate test? By this time, I was
tired of getting rained on and I was feeling the long walk from the
Metro, so I didn't continue any further. Should I have checked it
against B+?
I was thinking of trying this:
-reconnect the VR end of the triple plug
-re-attach the ground strap.
-place one sensor on each of the + and - of the ALT end of the triple
wire, simulating the dead ALT.
I should then get a current and resistance reading that more accurately
describes what is taking place in the system. Does this make sense, or
am I describing a great way to fry more electricals?
BTW, I found a local FLAP (Discount Import Parts) that has a Bosch ALT
for $84 (with core dep). I'll be acquiring and installing this weekend,
assuming I don't find a bad wire. As I was into the engine bay up to my
waist Monday night, I noticed that the engine door seal was gone and
water near the battery tray lip. I think I found the source of the
failure: no seal -&gt; rainwater access to inside of engine compartment -&gt;
water access to ALT -&gt; GEN light on. No starty, no drivey 'til new
seal. Chalk this up to how a $30 part can save you the trouble of
replacing your ALT ($85) and walking for a week. Tim would probably
point out that I also spent $30 on a VR unnecessarily, but now I have a
spare. It's not all bad news.
If the test I conducted were meaningless, please let me know a better
way, especially on the sender (blue wire). More importantly, if the
test I was thinking of conducting will cause harm, please let me know.
I appreciate all of the help you have supplied.

&gt; *Triple* check the ground wires specifically.
&gt; disconnect the wire going up front to the gen/alt light if possible
&gt; 	and then ohm it out to see if there is a short of any sort

&gt; Look over the circuit for the gen/alt light...it relies
