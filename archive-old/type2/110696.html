Subject: shift linkage problems

Hi,
I recently bought a 80 Westy and I've been having a lot of trouble with my shifter and was wondering if anyone had ideas.  Its gotten progressively more difficult to find 1st and 3rd gear since i've had it.  I've had my mechanic do a linkage adjustment twice now and its not perfect, but it works well for about 200 miles or so and then  it goes out of alignment again.  
At this point, I'm planning on seeing what happens if I replace the front shifter bushings , but I was wondering if there were other places in the shifter system that might cause this recurrent problem.  
any ideas are appreciated.
thanks,
aaron
