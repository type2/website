&gt; Then I'd lean towards it being a lubrication/bearing problem.  That's
&gt; kind of suspect, though, since you've replaced the starter itself.

Also, since the old starter and the new starter exhibit exactly the
same failure mode. When I put the new starter in, I replaced the
bushing in the bellhousing with the correct 6V part as well.

&gt; Assuming the contacts inside the solenoid are in good shape (which
&gt; should be a reasonable assumption for a new/rebuilt starter), I'd say
&gt; the next question is what happens if you connect a plentiful supply of
&gt; six volts up, and try to crank it?  Unfortunately, such supplies
&gt; aren't exactly common these days....

I have a 10amp 6V battery charger that I hook up. It will generally
start with this connected, but unfortunately it still turns rather
slowly. Although, 10 amps is probably not enough to turn a 6V starter
fast if the battery is run down and not helping much. On the third
hand, the battery does pass a load test at the auto parts store. On
the fourth hand, maybe they don't know how to test 6V batteries
anymore?

&gt; Looks like I'm stuck.  Next?

Does anyone know of an autoparts chain or a store in the
Denver/Boulder/Longmont area that sells new 6V batteries?
