Subject: bucking/hesitation update (again)

well my bus is running much much better.  however, i am still getting the
hesitation/bucking when going about 63 mph &amp; up.

today i adjusted the valves. everything looked good.

so here's where i am:
-new points &amp; condenser
-coil is good
-mixture adjusted by mechanic
-fuel line moved away from intake runner to avoid vaporization of fuel
before entering fuel pump
-tank outlet inspected &amp; no crud found
-valves adjusted

i am also noticing that the driver's side cylinder head is running hotter
than the passenger side. i know that is somewhat normal, but it is looking
to be about 100F above the passenger side, which does alarm me a bit. when i
back the speed down to 55 mph, the temp drops to just about where the other
head is running.

the bus is running fantastic around town, its just that i can't go 65 mph on
the highway &amp; i am losing power going up hills on the freeway.

any other ideas?

TIA!
