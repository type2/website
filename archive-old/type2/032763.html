Subject: Trip report / Questions (mirrors!)

Volks,
Whoa!  What a trip I had! :-)

Preface:  2 month mine '81 Vanagon G Westfalia, FI 4 speed.

The trip was from Eureka to Mt. View, about 300 miles each way, thru a
very hilly and rainy HWY 101.  Left around 11:30am after getting
everything together and gassing up.  I noticed as soon as I hit the
hills that 4th gear sucked!  (** Problem #1**) Now, this is my first VW
on my first &quot;long&quot; trip, so maybe I'm just not aware of the... love that
you need to give a 4 banger when on a 2 or 3 % grade, but it seemed like
whenever I got to even a mild grade that my speed would just slow and
slow until I downshifted into 3rd somewhere close to 45-50 mph.  (Oddly
enough, this might have had something to do with my oil, as you'll see
later)  Is this a normal thing?  Is there just no power at all in 4th
gear?

Other then that the trip down was mostly un-eventful.  Never got above
250 degrees!  I was very happy about that!  Kraftwerk helped me have
fun, fun, fun.  When I got there, the friends I was visiting drove me
around so my Vanagon just sat parked holding the dog food and such.  Not
a drop of rain the whole 4 days.  At least, not down by the bay area.

The real fun was on the way home.  Checked the oil before I left, but it
was cold so I didn't notice that anything was bad.  Seemed to be right
in the middle of the two notches cut in the dipstick, so I thought I
would be fine.  Plus, my PSI were still at a good 70lbs when cold.  I
started to notice that if I made a 60 mph turn to the right my oil light
would go on for half a moment, but I thought it was just a fluke.  Was
still above 20 lbs at idle warm.  But about 150 miles into the trip (and
way into the hills, and just after it starts to rain very hard) the
idiot oil light comes on.  I pull over right away (and I was just 15
miles without a shoulder, and just in time there was a very wide
shoulder with nice flat mud next to it.) and kill the engine.  Right
before that, I looked and PSI was almost nil.  A moment of panic as
I wonder if it will start again, where the closest phone was, and how I
was making fun of all my sillycon valley friends for having cell phones
leashed to their belts.

So I get the junk out of the back, open the engine, check the oil and
it's below the bottom notch!  Whoa!  So I add a quart and a half, let my
heart settle, and give the engine a try.  Starts the first time, back up
to about 30 PSI _at_ ~200 degrees.  Put the engine plate back together and
start out slowly.  PSI goes back up to about 70 in about a 30 seconds
and I feel better.  And to think I almost lost it!

But then I notice that all of a sudden I can accelerate in 4th gear
going up a slight incline.  This would not have happened before!  I also
notice that the wet of the rain/road seems to make me have a very slight
power loss, but so slight it may be my perception that is wrong.

Also, during the whole trip, but less so after the oil dealie, I noticed
that if I feel like i'm loosing power I can back off the gas and then
&quot;pump&quot; it once, back up to where I was and I'll have a bit more power
back.  If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say it was vacuum related and
that I must have a leak in the advance.  But that is a shot in the
dark.

So after all that, here are the questions I have:

- I never see oil on the ground.  The engine doesn't look oil coated or
anything.  Where is the oil going when I loose so much?  Should I just
take it for granted?  Is it getting burned up?  When I first got it, the
heat smelled faintly of oil as well as anywhere near the back of the bus
after a longish drive.  That no longer happens, though.  Any thoughts?

- What's the deal with the &quot;pump&quot; of the gas?  It's more like a sharp
slamming of the gas that helps bring power back.

- Was the 4th gear power problem related to the amount of oil I had in
the engine?  Something else?  I'm thinking I'm going to go over it this
coming weekend and change the tranny oil.  Will that help at all?  It
never slips or shimmies or anything.

- Mirrors!!!  Both of my outside mirrors were &quot;glued&quot; in the crack to
keep them were there are by the PO.  He said that the return springs
encased in the plastic are shot and there was no other way to keep them
from flopping all around.  Of course, they aren't placed for my height,
so how can I fix this?  I know I can take the &quot;glue&quot; (which is hard,
amber-brown, not tacky, but it gives just a little bit) out but what
type of glue should I use to replace it with?  I need something that
will harden kinda fast, will be able to be replaced, and that binds to
plastic.  Also, the stiffer the better.

-  Mirror #2!  My rear view mirror shows me a great view of the storage
compartment above the bed.  I could duck down a little bit and kinda see
the cars behind me, but not as well as I'd like.  If I were to place
that same mirror down about 2-3 inches I'd get a much better view?  Has
anyone done this?  Is it legal to have a low hanging mirror?  What about
a third party mirror?  Or should I just use that one to keep track of my
dog in the back seat?

Thanks!  Any help would be great!  It's been a lifelong dream to have a
VW Camper, and now that I have one, I can see owning two.  Ya know, to
have one to play with.  Can't play as much as I want to with my daily
driver!

Thanks again, and I love you all!

Share the day,
Seer
