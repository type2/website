Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 = Truck?? - Answered

Great ! !!  THANKS ! ! !

Yes, my question really was, what is a multipurpose Passenger Vehicle.


You answered it by your picture of the doorjamb sticker.

Now I have a basis for easily thwarting the Virginia State Police (look at 
the Virginia Code that says &quot;Multipurpose passenger vehicle&quot; and window 
tinting, and now look at my doorjamb.)

Of course, I just  HAVE   to run out to my USA '78 Westy to see if MY 
doorjamb sticker reads the same as your Canadian version.


I only wanted to find the definition for 'truck chassis' so I could 
determine that the '78 Westy IS a multipurpose passenger vehicle for window 
tinting purposes.


Now I hope I can use this logic in reverse:

Since my '78 is a Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle (MPV) per the doorjamb, and 
a MPV

    is one that is designed to carry no more than ten persons (obviously!! 
Look around inside...) and

    is constructed either on a truck chassis or with special features for 
occasional off-road use (get serious!!  Do you think my '78 Westy is even 
ABLE to run 'off-road'?!?!),

my '78 Westy must be a TRUCK!!!


I received some great responses, but Richard, many thanks for the best 
possible answer.

&gt;It's definitely build to truck standards, just look at the seatbelts from 
&gt;my 78 model that don't retract!
&gt;
&gt;Where they are giving you grief is that some book of theirs thinks it's a 
&gt;passenger vehicle just like the doorjamb says...

&gt;..the smog police here think they are trucks (thank goodness) because they 
&gt;are heavy and pollute like trucks. Good luck!
