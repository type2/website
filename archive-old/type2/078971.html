Subject: tire sidewall question

hello all,

now, how do i tell if a tire has re-enforced
sidewalls? i am currently looking at new tires for my
76 Westy. i'm interested in either the Bf Goodrich
allterrain T/As or goodyear ultra grips. anyone know
anything about either one of these. at any rate, i
need to know if they have re-enforced sidewalls, dont
have em now and can feel it when driving, makes me
nervous. any help will be greatly appreciated as
always. thanks much.

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
81 Diesel Rabbit  (soon)
