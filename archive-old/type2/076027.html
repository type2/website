Subject: Re: [T2] Power cleaners

With the camp grounds in Texas totally empty and my backlog of parts that
I'm planning on installing the power washer experience is an aid to me
and not a hindrance or damaging procedure. The areas I cleaned have
previously been maintained and were not exceptionally impacted with any
major greasy buildups.
I have all of the front suspension parts for my Westy (278K on the old
parts) that installation starts this coming Tuesday, I also have the new
CV boots and a tranny that I'm going to install (I always run used
trannys before I offer them for sale) that installation will take place
the next week.
So in spite of my poor use of grammar and my lousy punctuation I did not
just fall off the back of a turnip truck.
I knew what I was doing and I knew exactly why I wanted to power wash
those areas.
As for environmental issues....... my driveway run-off is no more
destructive to the city sewers than the fertilizers, insecticides or
grass clippings that all of my neighbors pump into the system every week
all year.
The neighbor on my West side brought me a cake last night and the
neighbor on the East side of me took me to lunch today so; If the cake
isn't full of ground glass and the East side neighbor didn't stick me
with the lunch tab.
I'd say I'm at peace with the world.
Additionally they both had the power sprayer company clean their
sidewalks and driveways so the operator of the spray equipment told me
anytime I had a quickie job, he'd swing by and it would be a freebie to
me.
I've really taxed my mind and I just can't come up with any regrets.
I concur with the concerns about cutting, blowing out or ruining seals
and parts, that just wasn't one of my concerns.

&gt; What about the environmental issues with all that grime going down 
&gt; the 
&gt; driveway into the gutters? Where I live, I'd have all sorts of 
&gt; problems!

Now you can think about all the water that you forced into places that
water really isn't supposed to go.  3000PSI goes past rubber seals with
no
problem at all, but how does the water (and soap?) get back out?
 ------------ snip ---------------------
That's probably enough pressure to rip a CV boot right off'un there.
Probably blow the grease out of a Cat D-9 link pin. Very dangerous
procedure. Keep an ear out for your bearings starting to rumble what with
the grit and water/steam forced into the rear hubs. More than garden hose
sprayer force is a bad idea for lots of places on a vehicle. Even that is
too much directed at shaft seals unless a soft low pressure spray is
employed.
