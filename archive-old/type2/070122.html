Subject: Anyone else go to the Monrovia VW Show

Overall, an excellent show, in my opinion.  Not huge but big enough.  
There were lots of very nice VWs there.  For me, the high points of the 
show were:

- - I got to see two nice split window crew cabs (one with a dual-turbo 
unit!

- - A nice lady was letting children help her paint flowers on her 
bay-window hippie-camper.

- - I got to see another SportMobile camper (it was nice to see what the 
stock camper interior looked like).

- - I got to see X-Terminator - the 150 mph VW beetle set a new world 
record on the drag strip.  Far out!
