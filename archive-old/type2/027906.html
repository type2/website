&gt;&gt;What does everyone recommend using to clean the fiberglass on a Westy 
&gt;&gt;pop-top? &lt;&lt;

I used a product called 'Fiberglass Magic' from Magic American Corp in 
Cleveland, OH.  I got it at the local Benjamin Moore paint center.  It comes 
in a yellow 1 qt. bottle with a green label.  It looks just like a baby 
Prestone bottle (that's anti-freeze for you air-cooled-only volks  =)  I had 
to use a little more elbow greese than the directions suggested but I think 
that's due to how long it had been since the top had been cleaned.  Mine now 
shines like almost new, but not as if I had it gelcoated.  I had enough left 
to do my shower in the house when I was finished with the pop-top.
