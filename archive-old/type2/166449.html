Hi Eddie,

I can tell you from personal experience that you CAN go that fast  
with that engine/transmission combo, for hours at a time. But do  
yourself a favor and be sure to get a CHT gauge if you intend to go  
out there and &quot;push the envelope&quot;.

Problems with heat in the type4 engine come from load. High speed =  
high load. As someone mentioned already in this thread, it takes  
twice the HP to go 80MPH than it does to go 60MPH.

Level ground at 80MPH is an acceptable load with no wind. 50MPH with  
a 50MPH headwind is not acceptable; the heads will surely overheat. A  
long hill at 75 MPH will overheat the heads, and so will a short hill  
at 80MPH.

The 091 transmission will give you 5% lower RPMs in 4th gear, which  
will help a bit with higher speeds on level ground.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

Lots of good info on this thread....

Geez.... I see people talking about going 75 on the highway. I don't
even think my bus can go that fast.
Luckily I'm in an area where I don't do lots of highway driving in the
bus... and even then, the highway I live near is
tame , and I can do 60mph without much turmoil. I can hit 65mph at
about 4300 rpm. I don't push it much beyond that. And I know that my
in dash tach is not accurate. I really use it for reference more than
anything...


I have a '76 2L engine with a transmission from a '72 bus. I got the
tranny with about 50,000 original miles from the original '72 bus (it
was from nantucket, can't do much driving on an island). It probably
has about 55,000 miles on it now. Would I be able to go much faster at
that rpm and/or get better highway mileage if I switched to the later
091 tranny?

I always figured running at around 4500rpm for extended periods would
overheat the engine.
