Ok, so how come the 091 trans I got out of a '79 went into my '74
without any modifications at all?  The only hitch I now recall was the
little nose-cone mounting block variations.  And anyway, if a different
(shorter?) shift rod was called for, couldn't that be gotten from the
same bus donating the tranny?
