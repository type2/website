&lt;&lt; I didn't see any 50-67 buses, but I saw a few of the loaf type and alot of 
vanagons.  They also have a couple of VW magazines there (in German).  Look 
at the big bookstores in the train stations.  One is called &quot;VW WOB&quot;.
 
 Anyway.... &gt;&gt;

There is (was) a museum a couple of blocks away from the assembly plant in 
Wolfsburg that had a bunch of old buses including a 1950 model.  

I may skip the museum this time as I wasn't too impressed last year.
