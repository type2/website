Dear Fellow A.I.R.S. list member, Bus enthusiasts, Dudes and Dudettes,

My name is John Baker and I live just north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  I am a '75
VW bus owner and a member of the Type 2 A.I.R.S. list.  I am writing to all
other bus folks in the surrounding areas to try and create a bus event for
2001 that is relatively local to all of us here in the Midwest.  I want to get some feedback from
you all to see if this is a popular idea.  I'm always seeing events in CA, AZ,
UT and other far away places but nothing really close to us.  So it hit me
&quot;Why don't I try to organize our own local event!&quot;
This is my idea:  An early summer event just north of Cincinnati (relatively
central to our states).  I used to manage a beautiful, secluded campground and
canoe livery on the Little Miami River about 30 miles north of the city on
I-71.  This is a privately family-owned place which is run by friends of mine 
 I see a weekend Bus Camp\Canoe Trip extravaganza. Through my connections with Morgan's Canoe Livery and Riverside Campground I can get kind deals for every one
on camping and canoeing.  There is a local band called &quot;Man Made Moon&quot; which I
can book for some good live music (folksy, bluegrassy, classic rock-ish
music)in the campground.  But best of all, it would be an opportunity for all
of us bus folks to get together and meet one another and just hang out having
a great time in a great environment and possibly have a little swap meet.  I
would personally be willing to handle all of the arrangements, planning, etc. 
The thing I would need help with would be promotion through web rings, chat
rooms, mailing lists etc.  So the questions I am asking all of you are these:
1)Do you think this is a good idea?  2)Would you attend this event if it
flies??, 3)Would you be willing to help spread the word, and 4)How many roads
must a man walk down before you can call him a man!!
Please email me back directly so as not to take up too much list space with your answers to these questions and any other
suggestions which you may have.  Please include dates and times of the year
which you think would be good (I am tentatively thinking Late MAy or Early
June.  This would give us nearly exclusive use of the campground)   I hope to
hear back from all of you very soon.  Thank You in advance!  I am also interested in any venders or companies who would be interested in co-sponsoring the event.
Peace,  John Baker
