&gt; Richard Atwell has previously posted on a move afoot in California to
&gt; eliminate the 30-year limit on smog testing, beginning with 1976 model
&gt; year vehicles. As Peregrine is a '76, I am following this with
&gt; interest.

We're boned. I have no idea what the less stringent amounts to exactly but
the collector insurance requirement is too restrictive.

Latest news from http://www.geocities_dot_com/smogrfg/ is:

8/24/04--AB2683 Has Been Amended

AB2683 has been amended. Here is what it means to you:

Section 1 has the following language: It is the intent of the Legislature,
in enacting the act adding this section, to ensure that vehicles, of the
1975 model-year and older are permanently exempted from the biennial
compliance requirement of the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (smog
check) program.

- 1976 and newer model vehicles are to remain in the smog check program
forever

- Amendments added a link to vehicle code 5051 and placed additional
requirements on 1976 and newer model vehicles as follows:

- A 1976 or newer model vehicle will always require a smog check

- When a 1976 or newer model vehicle reaches 35 model years old or older the
owner of the vehicle can get a less stringent test as defined below.

* To qualify for the less stringent test a 1976 or newer vehicle must meet
the following requirements:

- The owner presents proof that the vehicle is insured as a collector
vehicle
- No parameters are specified in the bill for the collector
insurance(example -- mileage)
- The vehicle must be at least 35 model years old or older
- The vehice must pass a tailpipe emissions test for that model year
- The vehicle must pass a Gas Cap Check
- The vehicle must pass a Fuel Leak Check
