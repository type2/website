Re: the antenna

OK, so I can have a faulty memory.....went out to the van and looked around
to try and stir the memory banks.  Then my wife got home so I enlisted her
help also.  End result is/was that I accessed the antenna through the
instrument cluster.  You have to remove the cover (it just snaps off, pull
UP on the forward side of it, using the two notches as hand holds) and the
instruments also (four screws, Speedo cable and several electric plugs) then
just reach in through the opening. A long and/or skinny are is a great help,
as is a helper on the outside of the van to help steady the antenna.

I think I got it right this time!
