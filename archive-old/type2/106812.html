Subject: Re: [T2] Tire size

&gt; Any reason to go with the larger size?
&gt;
&gt; Johnny, 195/75/14 is actually shorter than
&gt; 185/14.  I can think of no reason to use the
&gt; shorter (but slightly wider) tire.

There is Tire Size and Tire Size....
What you really need to compare are  the Revs per Mile of a given tire.
This is supplied by the manufacturer and is either measured directly or
calculated from previous data and takes into account weighted radius and
slippage.

If we just take 2 examples you can see the point.

Bridgestone 603v
185/14  25.7&quot; dia  811 rev/mile
195/75 14 25.6&quot; dia 825 rev/mile

But
Yoko 356
185/14  25.7&quot; dia   808 rev/mile (C)  809 (D)
195/75 14 25.8&quot; dia 808 rev/mile
