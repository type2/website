&gt;Really!? Wow, that's good to know! &lt;smile&gt; Uh, can I get a second opinion
&gt;on that? I was under the impression that the oil would start to degrade

Kate,

On the oil temp you are right and he is wrong.  If he thinks that 275 
is not hot, then it now makes sense to me why he thinks his early bay 
window bus was a &quot;lemon&quot;.

The normal operating temps on all my type 1 engines are between 
180-210 degrees F.

Dave
