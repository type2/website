Subject: Re: [VB] HOSED by a transport company!

  Thats one of the easiest moves there is. Go to/or call some of the  auto auction yards  in Phoenix, there are at least 10 transport companies 
out of them. You can drive your bus over and leave it there for the move. Texas is a stopping/transfer point for a lot of transport companies. 

  You should easily get it to Houston, Dallas or the port areas (is it Corpus Cristy), prices are dirt cheap as numerous trucks run daily on those 
routes from the auction yeards. 
  When I had my Barndoor brought out from texas it took less then 10 days to have picked up, moved to Phoenix then brought up here. To 
save money I had all moves made on &quot;space available&quot;, it sat in Phoenix for a few days and came up here with a load of new BMW's on the 
way to Vegas.

&gt;the waterheaded jackoffs at COMPLETE AUTO SALES of grand prairie 
&gt;texas just screwed me over BIG time - after 4 MONTHS of discussing 
&gt;the hauling of my 70 bus from phoenix to texas, they said today that 
&gt;not only had they scheduled it to be picked up after this weekend 
&gt;(the paperwork clearly stated it had to be picked up BEFORE), they 
&gt;then DENIED ever hearing about the job! *sswipe, i spoke to you 2 
&gt;days ago about it :P
&gt;
&gt;'waaaaaal, tony did the contract, and he quit. so we just tossed his jobs.'
&gt;
&gt;so now i am stuck with a bus that MUST leave phonix for west texas by 
&gt;monday, and to make things more exciting, the people i am renting the 
&gt;moving truck from (budget) have no more trailers or dollies for this 
&gt;weekend.
&gt;
&gt;any suggestions?
&gt;--
