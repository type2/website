Subject: Re: [T2] No Wiring Harness

From Todd Super Bassist:

I really really want a FACTORY wiring harness for my Bus. Now... whatever made my bus a 73 at least with
respect to wiring... is no longer the case. I have an 1800 with a manual transmission. It doesn't have any
emissions stuff, or an EGR on it, or any of that other stuff.

I see a couple of places that offer 1972 harnesses. Is there ANY reason at all why I can't use that in my
1973? Or.. even better, is there any reason why I shouldn't be able to use a 1970-1971 wiring harness in my
Bus?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

73 is the 1st year the fuse box moved to the center.  When the turn signals moved up above the headlights, the
fuse box had to be moved.  70 thru 72, the fuse box was above the headlight on the left. Each year, 70-72, has
a different fuse box and the wiring to them and the relays hanging out the bottom are different.

Each year has a different suffix letter:
70 bus = 411 937 505 A
71 bus = 411 937 505 B
72 bus = 411 937 505 C
and if you are wondering about D and E:
73 411 = 411 937 505 D
74 412 = 411 937 505 E
