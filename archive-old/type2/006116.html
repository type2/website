I'd guess your passenger side carburator is running too rich for whatever
reason.  I had a 34pict3 that (this is only a somewhat proven theory)
dripped gas which trickled down the lowest part of the manifold into
cylinder #2.  Kept fouling out the #2 plug, but #1 was always fine.  Smoked
too.  Good luck.
