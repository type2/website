Subject: Headlight switch wiring problem. 

------=_NextPart_000_003C_01C1529B.2E57D080
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have hooked up the headlight switch on my '73 Bus as per the '73 =
wiring diagram but I am still having problems with my headlights. There =
is a black and red (not red striped but has red squares on it) wire =
that, if not also directly connected to terminal 58b (the skinny =
terminal on left) along with the grey and red striped wire, my =
headlights won't work. If the red and black wire is pigtailed to the =
grey and red wire, the headlights still will not work. The black and red =
wire must be juiced directly to the 58b terminal for the headlights to =
work. The previous owner had the black and red wire crudely stuck inside =
the female push-on end of the grey and red wire.

What is this black and red wire for and why does it need to also be =
connected to terminal 58b for the headlights to work? I cannot find it =
on the wiring diagram. As best as I can see, it goes up to the =
instrument cluster. I'm guessing it goes to an idiot light.

Any help would be much appreciated. I've gone as far as I can go to get =
this working right.

TIA,
Larry=20
