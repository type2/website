Eddie,
You don't mention the year of your Bus so I will just look at a '77 wiring
diagram and hope it's close enough.

86a:  A red/white wire should go from 86a to terminal 50 on the starter
solenoid.  If you look on the solenoid, there are two small push-on
connectors on FI Buses.  One connects to the ignition switch (this is how
the starter knows to kick in when you turn the key to start) and the other
goes to the double relay.  Doesn't matter which is which, I don't think.
This wire signals the double relay that the starter is operating, and cause
the fuel pump side of the double relay to close and send power to the fuel
pump.

88y:  I show this as being a red wire that just goes from 88y to 88z.

88z:  This should be a red wire that goes directly to the positive terminal
of the battery.  This is the constant power supply to the relay which also
jumpers over to 88y as discussed above.

85:  85 is ground, easy enough.  A brown wire originally, was a very short
wire that ended in ring connector which mounted under one of the screws that
holds the double relay in place.

86c:  Originally a black wire, this is switched power.  This wire should go
over to terminal 15 (the + terminal) on the ignition coil.  This is how the
double relay knows to turn on system power when you turn the key on.  At the
same time that the ignition coil gets its 12v so does the FI system.

88d:  this was a red/blue wire that supplies 12v to the fuel pump, so it
should run from 88d down to the fuel pump and plug into the + terminal on
the pump.  Make sure you get that on the right terminal on the pump, or it
will run backwards.  On the other terminal of the fuel pump should be
connected a brown wire which goes to ground to complete the circuit.

The other portion of the double relay is the system power portion, and I
don't think you can make this work without the proper harness or without
splicing into the proper harness (at least on this side of the relay) as
most of these terminals interface with the control unit through the big
plug.
These terminals are:

88b:  Two white wires come from this terminal on the relay.  One goes to the
series resistors for the injectors (typically mounted right above the double
relay) while the other goes to the control unit.

88a:  a white wire comes from this terminal and goes to the intake air
sensor (AFM).

86b:  Two white wires come from this terminal.  One goes to the intake air
sensor (AFM) and the other goes to the control unit.

88c:  A white wire comes from this terminal and goes to the auxiliary air
regulator (this will be power for the heating element inside the air
regulator) and then another white wire goes from the auxiliary air regulator
to the control unit.

86:  Two white wires come from this terminal.  One goes to the control unit
while the other goes to the cold start valve to supply power and then
through the thermo-time switch to ground.  Power is also tapped off here for
the heating element inside the thermo-time switch.

And that's all the terminals on the relay.  You should be able to wire up
the fuel pump side of the relay without dealing with the FI harness, however
the other side will require the harness to work.

Hope this helps.

&gt; My struggle with this fuel pump continues....
&gt; I am sitting here with the relay and wiring diagram in front of me, but
&gt; for some reason I can't get this to work. I know the relay and pump
&gt; are in working order. Could someone please tell me how
&gt; to wire the FI fuel pump from the double relay. There are 6 terminals
&gt; involved on the relay. (86a,88y,85,88z,86c,88d) Where are they supposed to
&gt; go? I'm missing the harness that was designed for this. Are they
&gt; available anywhere? Or is there an easier way to do this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt; Eddie
