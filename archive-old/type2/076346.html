Subject: After you get the CV's and axles off:

After you get the axles and CV's off the bus, there is another tool you
might want to buy called an external snap ring plier that will help you
remove the snap ring on the end of the axle next to the CV in order to
replace a brocken axle boot and clean the CV.

***BEFORE you remove the CV, take some very thin wire, carefully remove all
the cap screws and washers keeping the CV straight on the axle, slid the
metal plate back that is on the rubber boot away from the CV and run a
couple pieces of wire through the inner most part of the CV (not the axle
hole as the axle is still in place) and then out through one of the cap
screw holes.  Put a couple pieces of wire 180 degrees apart from each other
and twist lock the wire tightly.***

This will keep the CV from twisting when you take it off the axle.  If you
have every lost the balls out of a CV, you know what problems you face if
you do not do this.

Clean the CV's completely in NON FLAMMABLE engine solvent (another cheap
insurance), let dry (better yet, blow dry with pressure, using safety), then
repack with CV grease only.  CV grease is the only type of grease that will
work in this application as it does not migrate like other greases and will
not get thin under the heat and pressures that are generated.  Force the
grease all the way throught the CV by hand.

It will not hurt to mix up CV's and axles as long as they are wire tyed.  It
WILL hurt if you drop the balls out of a CV and do not get them back into
their same grove as each ball will wear a bit differently.
