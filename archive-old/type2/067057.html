&gt; My concern is about safety.  Since you take off all the plugs, and lay the 
&gt; plug wires around, won't gasoline be coming out of the sparkplug holes?
&gt; Won't those wires be getting a current?  Isn't this a dangerous combination?

        You can always disconnect the coil and/or pop the cap off of
the distributor.  The plug wire ends won't be live in these cases.
