Re remmoving stuck CV bolts- 
The old kind I used an allen with a small pipe extension applying torque
while beating on the bend.  A socket with the torx or allen end can be
used on the end of a torque drive socket holder, the kind you hit with a
hammer and it turns about 20 degrees. - About the same effect as an
impact air tool.
Instead of drilling, I've had good luck with a cutoff wheel (the
reinforced fber kind) on a Dremyl- and they now have a right angle
adaptor for the Dremyl for tight spots.  Go to Woodworker's Warehouse,
they have a 5 pak of ENKAY cutoff disks, bigger and cheaper than
$Dremyl.
Hey George, I thought I was the only one who admits he lifts his rear by
a shock mount - I use that small easy-to-carry WalMart floor jack &amp;
carry a hunk of 6x6 landscape tie to lift the front with same. MB
