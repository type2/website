Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

Mine does it up here too in B.C. Canada. I just put a steering wheel cover
over it, no more problem. My bug doesn't seem to be as bad for some reason.

to

&gt;
&gt; ??? at the rate mine has been doing this my steering wheel should have
&gt; vanished many years ago!!!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; the problem worse though i think its not true rubber but a vinyl foam.
A
&gt; &gt; good question though is does this happen in drier climates as well? Is
&gt; &gt; moisture catalyzing the acceleration of the materials decay?  If so then
&gt;
&gt; ? not sure, Baltimore is hardly a dry climate
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i have a theory though that it may be the result of driving with greasy
or
&gt; &gt; oily hands and the oil irepairably damages the foam, it makes sense, i
&gt; &gt; know i have driven after making roadside reapirs with filthy hands.
&gt; &gt; anyone have any support for that idea?
&gt;
&gt; I just thought it was the dirt I left there days earlier rubbing back off
&gt;
&gt; ?
