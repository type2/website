Fear not, the Bus-types are not alone.  I can tell you that campgrounds,
hotels, restaurants, etc. act much in the same way when a group of
motorcycles rides up.  I wonder what they'd think if I were to pull in
towing my Harley with my Bus?

And I agree.  No place of business (or anyone) should have to put up with
crap from disorderly people of any kind.

&gt;&gt;Maybe we need to be aware of the possibility that we are &quot;marked&quot; by some
&gt;&gt;business people who come in contact with all the various kinds who are
part
&gt;&gt;of our clan, and so we get stereotyped unfairly.
&gt;
&gt;We have neighbors who run a KOA Kampground, and they tell me that they
&gt;cringe whenever a VW Bus comes in.  Most of their experience with busses
&gt;has been college kids who make noise, party, litter, and often fail to pay.
&gt;Most of their customers are retirees on vacation, and they don't like this
&gt;a bit.
&gt;
&gt;It may be an unfair stereotype, but I also feel bad that the campground
&gt;owners often have to put up with that nonsense.
