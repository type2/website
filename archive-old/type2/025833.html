&gt; I can assure you this, your problem is not that the bus has fuel injection!

Charlie I was not saying that I should replace the FI - just that it is very
sensitive and that I was frustrated. Furthermore, I did not really want to
get rid of the bus again I was just frustrated.

Maybe I am just too much of a bull in a china shop?(I am a Torus)  I do not
know - but I have solved the current less power problem! The wire to the #1
injector had come loose. This may also explain the weird &quot;tach bounce&quot; I was
getting. I feel stupid - but, I am also wondering if I have to check every
(OK that's an exaggeration) connection each time I work on the bus???
