Subject: Does anyone have a front engine tin from a 71 1600 bus

Tom,

I have the &quot;front tin&quot; (one year only) for a doghouse set up as well as the
&quot;air exhaust duct&quot; pieces if you need them.

me?


&quot;obligatory disclaimer&quot;
I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    &quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;
