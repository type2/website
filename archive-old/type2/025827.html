&gt; I am looking for a little info for someone who has been around VW's longer
&gt; then I.  I have a 1970 Kombi with a 1600 dp.  Is there any difference in
&gt; the plug wires, cap and rotor from a 1600 in a bug?  Oh yea I have a 009
&gt; dizzy (which I can not understand how to time for the life of me.)  I am
&gt; asking because a friend has a set of wires, a cap and rotor that he bought
&gt; for his bug, but never installed, and if I can use them I can have them.

The electricals from your friend's stash will work on your engine.
