Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

&gt;As much as I would love to have my playstation and DVD player in my 
&gt;bus....I
&gt;can't help but think it would clash with the era of the bus.  Although,
&gt;having two children (4 and 10 months) and having crossed the country with
&gt;them already, it is starting to sound like it may not be a bad idea. :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
Youd think.
But then again the bus is THE best wardriving vehicle I have found so 
far.......
Inverter, a table, a high roof for an antennae. Cold drinks on hand. The 
laptop just likes it.
I used to drive to some remote place in college and type papers in my bus. 
Sometimes I sit outside the office and do my work while in my bus, its just 
that comfy.


If you dont know what that is, have a google search.

NOTICE: I use wardriving as part of my business. I go in and secure critical 
businesses.
