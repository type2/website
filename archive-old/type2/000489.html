Although ( apparently ) handling would improve if I dropped the suspension
on my 71, in the quest for a finer looking charge, I have decided not too
mess with the suspension that VW spent so long perfecting and have decided
instead to source out a new set of alloy wheel rims and lower profile tyres,
thus, achieving the same effect, or nearly, and the desired look.

Well, how low.....and how wide ?
are there limits ?e.g.: 16 &quot; wide rims with Pirelli P6's ?......and does
this mess with your speedo ?
Also, will any 5-stud wheel fit....._dot_can anyone suggest a happy and
attractive combination ?
....or am I going to end up with a bus that looks like an obese skateboard ?
Thanks as ever..
Garp
