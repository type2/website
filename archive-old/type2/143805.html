Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch problems - SOLVED

I was going thru starters on my 77 Westy and thought
the same thing.......  until I gave up on
reman/rebuilt or used starters. Bought a NEW starter a
while ago from Bus Depot and that fixed my problem.
It did not matter who rebuilt the starters, even the
Bosch ones were crap.

 A big thanks to all who helped with my problem.
 Ignition switch was 
 fine, but my starter was toast. Thanks to Karl for
 his troubleshooting 
 help and to Jack for his offer of a loaner starter
 to see if thats was 
 the problem.
 
 One question: This starter is only like 15 months
 old. Is there 
 something wrong with me/my bus that is causing it to
 eat starters??
