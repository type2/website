Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Build (Difficulty Rating?)

Get some general books on the subject and learn how to use a torque wrench
the right way.  Some folks seem to find this a mystery.  Then follow
instructions carefully and don't ever try to force anything and it will be
not too bad at all.

&gt; Dave,
&gt; I'd considered doing a rebuild myself, with the Al
&gt; case.  I've seen them as cheap as $285.  It's still on
&gt; my list of &quot;possibles&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; How high on the 'Difficulty Scale' is replacing the
&gt; case?  I understand the process of gutting my engine
&gt; and placing said guts in new case, but how hard is it
&gt; really?
&gt;
&gt;
