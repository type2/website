When I was looking for an original Westy tent for my '74, I couldn't find one,
so I bought a new tent from Germany and liked it so much I decided to start
selling them.

This weekend was the first big VW event that I have setup one of my new tents
at. (Circle your Wagons)    I constantly had people coming by and admiring my
tent.  I had three offers to buy my demo, and another 3 people who are ready
to sell their original Westy tents, and buy one of mine.  (I should have more
info on one of these in a few days)  I did enjoy myself, but I also got a
little tired of showing off the tent when I wanted to go look at all the other
cool buses.

The tent worked out great.  It was the perfect place to be when it was
raining, and a great hangout in the evening.  Now it does take a few minutes
to set  up, but at a VW event, these tents are perfect.

I promised myself that this year I would try to get to more VW events.  I
really enjoy meeting other VW nuts, and listees.  Events that include camping
are more up my alley.  I much prefer looking at the &quot;real&quot; buses and campers
and meeting the &quot;real&quot; bus people.  Oh sure, I guess the trailer queens are
nice.  But I usually pass them right by and head for the daily drivers.  Now
if I can only disguise my New Bus tent in some way so it doesn't look so cool,
people might leave me alone long enough that I could see the rest of the event
and enjoy myself a little.

Happy Camping!
