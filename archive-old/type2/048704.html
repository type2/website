Subject: [T2] VW flywheel shims

The size marked on VW shims is metric.  A 24 marking indicates 0.24 MM, not 0.024 inch.
0.24 MM measures between 0.011 and 0.0105 inch.  Are we talking apples and oranges here?

&gt; The &quot;whole&quot; story is that we had measured the endplay pretty accurately to
&gt; between 0.06 and 0.07 with this tool, moved to thicker shims -- i.e. replaced
&gt; a 0.024 and a 0.028 with two 0.034's (do I have an extra zero in there?)
&gt; and then measured the endplay to be 0.0035-0.004.  When I got home,
&gt; I found out that the engine was hung up and replaced the 0.034's with a
&gt; 0.030 and a 0.032, and bingo! the engine, she turns.  I'm hoping that since
&gt; i just shaved off 0.006 of the 0.016 of shimmage that i added, I'm under
&gt; 0.006 and hopefully just around 0.004 or 0.005, but i should check with
&gt; Bob's meter sometime soon...
