Subject: [T2] Speaking of Bruck of Germany

I replaced my pulleys. The listing on CIP for the alternator pulley listed 
Made In Germany right on
it. It was Bruck. Seems to be a pretty good pulley. Are we sure it's all 
made in China?

I also sprung for a brand new made in Germany crank pulley, with VW right on 
it. Spendy but much better than the Brazilian stuff.

I was dealing with

http://www.qualitygermanautoparts_dot_com

He mentioned that not one part from Bruck was actually made in
Germany. He also mentioned that the parts were inferior?
