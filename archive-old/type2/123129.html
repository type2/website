&gt; To get it to work without *any* mods, you are going to have to stick

&gt; 
&gt; I currently have a 412 motor that is being prepped for a 75 westy, so I 
&gt; know what you're up against.

I've used one off and on in my 78 as a backup engine
and I actuallly owned a new 74 412, it really was an underrrated vehicle

&gt; 1. 412's had fuel injection, not carbs. You will have to get an FI fuel 
&gt; tank and fuel pump to use the 412 FI in your bus, and you will need to 
&gt; obtain the entire engine wiring harness, intact.  Our plan is to use 

the FI on the 412s was different than the FI on a bus.. the bus FI is the
better of the two

&gt; the FI that originally came with the motor we pulled out of the bus.
&gt; If you don't go with the 412 fuel injection, you will need to obtain a 
&gt; carburetor. The 72 bus originally came with solex dual carbs, but there 
&gt; are many other options available, including the infamous single weber 
&gt; progressive. I've had dual solexes on all my buses but have found them 
&gt; troublesome to tune, so my next project is to convert the westfakia to 
&gt; FI.

have to agree, I have had dual solexes, and they are real dogs to adjust.

&gt; 2. The engine hanger bar brackets are different from the 412 to the 
&gt; bus, so you will need to find a pair from a bus and bolt them to the 
&gt; hanger in place of the ones from the 412.

if you have the hanger off the bus it should work on the 412
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The heater boxes from a 412 are very weak compared to those used on 
&gt; a bus. They will fit, but they don't produce nearly as much heat. 72-74 
&gt; bus heater boxes will fit just fine and give much better heat.

that is the understatement of the day, the 412 came stock with an aux
heater  a BA-4

&gt; 4. The dipstick on the 412 will be coming out of the top of the motor, 
&gt; which will be a major PITA, considering that the 2 doesn't have the top 

not all 412s had the dipstick out the top it would depend on what car it
came out of, the 412s in a sedan were out the top, but the ones in a
square back  (Station wagon) came out the back like a bus. 

&gt; access hatch. I would strongly recommend you add an oil filler tube and 
&gt; dipstick from a 72-79 bus engine before you install this in your bus. 
&gt; It will work as-is but it won't be convenient; and if you neglect your 
&gt; oil bad things may happen. You'll also need to get the rear tin to go 
&gt; with the filler tube and dipstick.

if yours comes out the top I would agree if it comes out the rear you will
still need a bus dipstick as the 412 had an extender and longer dipstick
&gt; 
&gt; I originally suggested the 412 as it is often overlooked at scrapyards 
&gt; where the buses are already picked clean.

I happen to think the FI in the bus is better so I try to use the bus FI
in any 412 engine swap I do....try to get a bus FI system and fuel tank
for your conversion.  otherwise learn to sychronize the dual carbs.

good luck
Bob
