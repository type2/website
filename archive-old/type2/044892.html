Subject: [T2] Kristin article

hey volks,
just wanted to post the link to the NJ article on
Kristin this morning.   if this hasn't hit us hard
enough, the article tells that she went to college at
the same school as i attended, during the same time,
so i might even have met her.   here is the link:
