&gt; He spent the better part of two years trying to track down the
&gt; problem and met with a representative from VWoA and Tom Noble (the largest
&gt; VW rebuilder here in the NW several years ago).  The VW rep said they didn't
&gt; like selling rebuilt T4 engines &quot;because 50% lost valve seats within 40K
&gt; miles&quot;.  Tom Noble said the same and that he voided any warranty if the jugs
&gt; were blue. These were regularly serviced, stock grocery getter T4 Buses and
&gt; campers.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you guys any similar experience and/or come up with a cure?

Wow, sounds like your friend has really gone out of his way to do his
homework.  Jake may be better qualified to answer this than I am, after all
it's his business.  But I do have a couple ideas on the matter.

First off, I do believe the type of fuel we are burning has a lot to do with
the excess heat, it burns much quicker than it used to.  The fuels we have
now are not leaded which also helped lubricate and cool the valves.  I know
people have argued with me in the past about fuel, but I still contend the
higher the octane rating you can buy, the better off you are.  Octane is the
speed of which the fuel burns, the higher the octane, the slower it burns.
With a higher octane you don't get a really hot &quot;flash&quot; in the cylinder like
you would with a lower octane.  The type 4 engine does have fairly high
compression, you wouldn't run a 60's muscle car on low octane would you?  VW
called for leaded 91 octane when the engine was new and the gas was better,
what are we burning now?

The type 4 engine also passed less unburned fuel out, which would help cool
the valves.  Bentley says a 34 PICT-3 carb had 3% CO (unburned fuel) where
the fuel injected engines had .2%!!!  That's POINT 2 percent!  Thats a VERY
lean mixture.

And last, but far from least, we have forgotten how to drive an air cooled
engine.  The type 4 has so much torque, you can drive it like a water cooled
engine which is how a lot of people drive them.  If you don't keep your
engine at 3,000 - 3,500 RPM, you are burning it up.  Shift down or up, but
maintain that RPM for the engines sake!!  Of course, you will use lower
RPM's when you are speeding up, but don't stay there very long and if you
start to &quot;lug&quot; your engine and the RPM's drop, shift down.  When you're
pushing around that much weight with such little HP, it doesn't take long to
heat something up.

Dang, I'm not supposed to start teaching again for another month!!  Sorry
about that.  I guess you asked for it.
