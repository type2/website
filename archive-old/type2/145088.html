I've seen pictures of Busses with them, do you or anyone else know if these were ever original on the Bus? I thought that they were, but maybe I'm just mistaken?


Thanks!

&gt; I didn't mention my bus is a 73 camper. I have also
&gt; looked into the ragtop alternative. The only reason I
&gt; would like to keep the fiberglass top is to maintain
&gt; the bus' original style. 
&gt; 
&gt; The only place I found a ragtop was on the following
