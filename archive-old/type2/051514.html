&gt;  I am the founder of a Volkswagen collectors group called AIRS, the 
Aircooled
&gt;  Interstate Rescue Squad.  All of our members are collectors and drivers of
&gt;  classic Volkswagen busses, beetles, and other models.
&gt;  
&gt;  Our members travel and camp in many campgrounds all over the country.  Many
&gt;  of our members are professionals in various fields and use this hobby as a
&gt;  way to relax.  Many of them also live in Virginia, North Carolina, and
&gt;  Tennessee.
