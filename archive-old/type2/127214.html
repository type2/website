Take heard Don- you are experiencing the trials and tribulations of
putting a bus back on the road. It has most likely been abused most of
it's recent life. From the sounds of what you have seen, you are most
likely just seeing the results of running that bus some. Lots of
things can go wrong for a while after getting it running, then it all
starts to smooth out. Think back to when it did run well when you got
it, remember that drive back? It got me thinking about my first trip
in my 79 right after I bought it. Here is what my thoughts were:
