Georges last reply's:

&gt; Replying  to my own reply...
&gt;
&gt; Actually, my problem is that I had to put all the stock shims and one
&gt; extra between the pulley halves to get the proper 1/2 inch play.  I have a
&gt; feeling that a 11.3x912 belt will be even tighter.
&gt;
&gt; George Lyle

No, the 11.3X912 will not be tighter. Also, the inner side of the belt has a
serrated cut design to it.  They seem not to need to be adjusted as often as
the stock belt.

I've used this belt on all the type 1 engines that I've put alternators in
over the last 8 years with good results.  Most of those have been run with
degree pulleys however.  I think you said you were running with the stock
pulleys. This belt should still be the one to use with your set up.
