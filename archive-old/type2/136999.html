POR-15.

&gt; I also have rust around
&gt;the windshield under the rubber molding, should the
&gt;windshield be popped out to stop the rust ?

Yes, if you want to do it right be be advised that if it's rusty and you remove the windshield the holes under the gasket may open up when you remove the windshield (sometimes the rust is glued to the seal) and it will leak worse than ever. My advice is either to spot repair it and leave it in order to keep the water out or do the complete repair and fix it properly.

&gt; If so are
&gt;there any articles around on removing windows from a
&gt;bus ?

Removing the windshield is only a matter of cutting the gasket (if you are throwing it away anyway) or using a wooden implement to fold it back from the inside and have a helper pop it out.
