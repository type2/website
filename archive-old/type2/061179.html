Subject: '69westy interior into a '72 bus

List,

I will be acquiring an interior from a 1969 westy form Doc Ric. The interior
is complete and in reasonably good shape. I would lke to install this
interior into our 72 passenger bus. I have some questions regarding the
transplant.

The 72 is a complete model 22. All the seats, interior panels, headliner,
glass etc are there and in good shape. I do not wish to &quot;violate&quot; the bus,
so to speak. I would like to remove the interior items and replace them with
the blindspot cabinet, bed, overhead compartment, table and jumpseat. I
would also like to install the Jalousie windows and curtain rod frames.

I have reviewed the Bentley regarding removal of the camper interior and it
seems straightforward enough. Installation of the Westy interior should
require some drilling of holes in the cargo floor and rear wheel arches to
mount the cabinet and bed and a few more holes for the jump seat. Can the
cainet and overhead be installed with out tearing up the headliner? 

Will there be any compatibility problems installing the windows? The 
Jalousies require 15 screws per window.  Will I need to tap some holes for a
good fit or can I just drill pilot holes and use self tapping screws?

Any advice is welcome. Honestly, I am also a little uncertain about the
morality of making the passenger bus a camper. There are a helluva lot more
campers left than passenger buses. I actually love this bus and feel a
little weird about doing this but next week the one owner 69 will finally be
in the driveway and the fate of the '72 is up in the air. 

If anyone is interested in purchasing the '72 before it becomes a camper: it
is complete and in good shape, runs well and has a brand spanking new Sachs
clutch. P mail for deatails.
