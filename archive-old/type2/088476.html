i am about to make a tire cover for my front-mounted spare and i was =
thinking of embroidering/stitching on an emblem, so maybe i will just =
put
it on the tire upside down.
chris, sad that it has come to this

Well then, it is sort of appropriate, isn't it? Sort of like flying the =
flag upside down. I think we all ought to start doing it. Here we are =
out here, keeping the VW namesakes alive and well, popularizing them by =
keeping them in public view and celebrating them as classics and =
durable, practical daily drivers. These are the very cars that put VW on =
the map, and they don't even carry the products we need any more to keep =
these cars running.. But they're going to tell us that we can't use the =
name of the car when we make products to celebrate and keep these cars =
alive. Maybe we can come up with a new name, sort of like that =
entertainer...&quot;Prince&quot;. What's his name? &quot;The Entertainer, Formerly =
Known As Prince&quot;.. OK. We can refer to our cars as &quot;The Automobile =
Formerly Known As Volkswagen&quot;. Or how 'bout let's take those letters and =
switch them around.. WV. Let's work on this a bit. Any ideas?
