Subject: Carb problems

        Our splittie project has a new motor now, and moves quite nicely. 
We do have one small problem. We have worked on this for days. The engine 
will only idle with the pilot jet backed out 1/2 to 1 turn. As far as we 
can tell all vacuum leaks are dealt with, timing is spot on for a 009. 
We  assume there is a blockage in the carb itself, in the pilot circuit. 
Does anybody have any suggestions, experience?
        The engine particulars are:
1600 DP, now 1776.
Rebuilt heads
34-PICT 3 carb (replacing the kadron kit-chokes and carb heat are 
critical in the mountains, besides, I like the high torque of a big 
engine with a smallish carb)
This is the second carb which won't idle, both taken down and cleaned and 
re-gasketed.

Please help. It is a shame that this clouds a great experience. The 
'big', new engine and the short gearing make this bus quite quick.

PS does anybody build an extractor/header that has the small rear heater 
box (as seen in Bill Fisher's &quot;How to Hot Rod VW Engines&quot;, p.29)

Thanks, Thanks, again Thanks
Chris and Buffy
