Subject: Fuel Guage expert?

Hello,

I am installing a fuel guage in my 72 bus, yes the previous owner wasn't 
interested in having one.

Anyways the backing plate that the guage goes into has a &quot;G&quot; and a &quot;+&quot;, 
which wire goes where (i.e I have a brown and a white one)? Then the wires 
that attaches to the backing plate appear to be black and brown (the broen 
one I confirmed goes to the sending unit), where do they go?

Thanks, Phil.
