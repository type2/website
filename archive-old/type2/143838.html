Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the engine supposed to be?

&gt; I just broke a cable inside the bowden tube myself so I'm wondering what's
&gt; wrong with my setup...

This was passed on to me from another listee and I believe it now.

Leave the clutch cable a little looser.
I make sure there is a little extra slack free play at the pedal.
I used to always snug up the slack so that I could feel the
cable right as I pressed the pedal with my hand.
Used to break clutch cables a lot more often.
