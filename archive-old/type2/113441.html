&gt;69 Bus which Bosch Starter, the SR15X ($96.00) or SR17X ($135.00). Whats the
&gt;difference if they both fit and have the same warranty?

The SR17X is mucho heavy duty. It also is stock for the early 911/912 
Porsche. The SR15X requires the bushing for the end of the shaft in the 
bellhousing is in good order, but will come with a new one. The SR17X has a 
much more robust shaft and doesn't use or need this bushing support. Note 
that they have quite different core values that will be in play as well. 
The SR17X is a very easy way to enhance a T-I motor. Just bolt it in with 
no modification at all.
