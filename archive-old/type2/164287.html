Subject: Almost 40 and still kicking

I'm not almost 40, but my Double Cab is. I just hope I can work as hard as
this truck when I get there. This is proof that these vehicles are 1-ton
capacity. It just shook it off. The only thing that was iffy was the clutch.
The motor has too much power for the tiny Beetle clutch size. I had to be
very careful, but with the Kennedy 200lb clutch, it held out, it just stunk
to high heaven when I had to start on a hill fully loaded.
