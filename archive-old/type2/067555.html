&gt;
&gt;Well, I finally got a chance to check out this camper I mentioned last
&gt;week... is NOT a Dormobile.
&gt;What it IS is a fairly nice 67 panel van converted to a camper, although I
&gt;could be wrong about that.
&gt;Here are the details:
&gt;VIN #:  217099617  Engine #: AE 548288
&gt;Mcode plate:
&gt;272
&gt;426 043 080
&gt;US 2112   131383   7099617
&gt;Paint - Perlweis L 87
&gt;The poptop is one O them small square ones, manufactured by Travel
&gt;Equipment Corp from somewhere in Indiana I think. The windows are the kind
&gt;with the BIG bolts holding them in, which is what makes me think
&gt;&quot;aftermarket.&quot; The window on the driver's side  has a large center glass,
&gt;and is stamped &quot;Hehr L 2592A 137 577&quot;  The nicest thing I saw was a
&gt;Volkswagen/Stewart Warner heater, in PRISTINE shape! (model # 8335-12). The
&gt;guy said he never ran it.The bed was down, but the upholstery seemed to be
&gt;a saltandpepper plasticy material that was in mint condition. He said it
&gt;was original. Ther is almost no rust - some rocker rot, floorboards seemed
&gt;OK. Bad stuff- really mangled driver door, bent rear bumper brackets, what
&gt;we believe to be a dropped valve, and NO 4th gear. Bus came from Oregon.
&gt;Anyone recognize it?
&gt;The guy *really* doesn't want to sell it, but you know how that goes. He
&gt;was talking about trading it for a mountain bike to get to work with!! What
&gt;I would like to do is 1) find some info for him, so he can get a fair price
&gt;(my buddy Lewis says &quot; he'd sell it to you for $400... if you had no soul&quot;)
&gt;and 2) maybe find him a buyer on here that makes him feel better about
&gt;parting with it. Any help on either?
&gt;- -Craig
