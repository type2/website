Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vacuum gauge

Thanks Rick, most informative. I was curious because I was used to using vacuum
gauge to assist in locating vacuum leaks. After fixing the major leak I had and
a couple smaller leaks I am still only getting about 14 inHg and rock steady at
idle regardless of temp. This may be due to the fact that to get 900 rpm at idle
up here, I have to open my Idle Air adjustment screw farther than if I were at
sea level, I hope. Just trying to find confidence that I have found all the
leaks. Your explanation leaves me feeling a bit better.
Thanks,
Tom

&gt; Tom,

&gt; The short answer is no, altitude will not affect vacuum gauge readings.
&gt; However, as you already know, altitude affects engine power, so at a higher
&gt; altitude, you will need to operate at a lower indicated vacuum than at sea
&gt; level.  Lower vacuum = more air volume to the cylinders.
&gt;
&gt; Conveniently, for every 1000' of altitude, ambient air pressure (and
&gt; manifold pressure) drops by about 1&quot;.  As a San Diego (sea level) bus
&gt; operator, I try to limit my cruise and hill climb power to 5&quot; of vacuum so
&gt; I'm not &quot;maxing out&quot; my engine all the time.  But when I go over the
&gt; mountains, for every 1000' of altitude, I lose some power, so I allow myself
&gt; another 1&quot; of vacuum to make up for it.  Example: Mountain Pass at 3000' I
&gt; climb at 2&quot; of vacuum. At 5000', I'm wide open (vacuum = 0&quot;). If I can't
&gt; maintain speed at 50 MPH on a hill using the appropriate vacuum, I downshift
&gt; to 3rd.  The government tends to label altitudes on highways so you don't
&gt; need a barometer.
&gt;
&gt; My method is a bit detailed, but hopefully you get the idea.  At 7000' you
&gt; will probably be at 0&quot; vacuum to climb hills anyway, but if you drive down
&gt; to the flatlands you can use your vacuum gauge to manage your power.  It
&gt; also is a good trend tool for general engine health.  My typical readings
&gt; are:
&gt;
&gt; 77' Westy 2.0L FI, Sea Level
&gt; Cold Idle:  10-12&quot;
&gt; Hot Idle:       17-21&quot;
&gt; Cruise at 60 MPH:  10-11&quot;   (Head/Tail Winds can make a BIG difference here)
&gt; Climb at 50-60 MPH:  No Less than 5&quot;, adjusted for altitude.
&gt;
&gt; My idle vacuum and RPM's do vary with air temperature, since my cooling
&gt; hardware is a work in progress.  I suspect when I get a thermostat it will
&gt; idle consistently around 19&quot;. Have fun with your vacuum gauge!

&gt;
&gt; &gt;From your experience, does altitude affect your vacuum readings? I Live at
&gt; 7000
&gt; ft and was just wondering if you ever noticed if vacuum decreased with
&gt; altitude.
&gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; An in-dash vacuum gauge is very nice to have IMO, and amusing on long
&gt; &gt; trips.  It can also alert you to a potential problem with your
&gt; &gt; engine.  I've been running one for several years - here is my installation
&gt; &gt; for anyone that's interested.  There is also a picture of the Vanagon
&gt; &gt; speedo (6-digit odometer plus resettable trip meter) installed in my
&gt; &gt; baywindow dashboard.
