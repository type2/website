Subject: Re: [T2] Denver is nearly a sure thing now...

Not sure exactly what ACVW stands for but I just went through this 
process with my 63 DC and one of my 78 Transporters.  If you can, go 
with the Collector Vehicle plates.  You pay a fee of $200 dollars which 
registers the vehicle for 5 years.  The good part about this route is 
that you only have to get the vehicle smogged once.  Then never again 
during its time in Colorado.   So, yes I did have to get the 63 and 78 
smogged but it was not too hard.  There is a place by the name of 
Painters Grinding in Denver which does good work if you need someone to 
take a look at it.  They can check your exhaust emmisions and everything 
ahead of time also to tell you if you'll pass or not.  If you go with 
the regular plates, you'll have to smog every year or two.

I really don't miss California now.  ;)

&gt;I have not seen very many ACVWs on the road *in Denver*.  Around 
&gt;Thanksgiving time, I posted about an ACVW shop I drove by in Pine, CO 
&gt;(which people seem to think is called &quot;Pine Beetles&quot; ... anyway, Pine 
&gt;is not that far away from Denver).  If you can confirm the name of this 
&gt;shop, you might want to give them a call and ask them about their 
&gt;experience with old ACVWs and regulatory compliance.
