&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;    I am new to the list and i was wondering if anyone knows of or has a
&gt;1965-1976 VW bus for sale in or near the Miami(Florida) area? The only
&gt;criteria i have is that it runs well and has little to no rust, the
interier
&gt;could have been attacted be a bear, just as long as there's somewhere to
sit.
&gt;I appreciate all of your help and await your reply.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;Christopher Johnson
