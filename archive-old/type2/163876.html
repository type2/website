Subject: Winter Storage

Hi all,

I've looked through the archives and I haven't come to a definitive
conclusion regarding covers.  It would appear that there is more than
one school of thought regarding car covers in general.  Likewise, I
have limited time and funds at this point but, I want to make sure I
take car of my poor bus for the winter.  I had plans to replace the
leaking seals and repair rusted steel around the windshield, driver's
side jalousie, driver's side rear window and also the rear hatch
window.  I can probably scrape together the money to replace those
seals and repair the corroded steel while finishing it with primer
over primer but, I doubt that I'm going to have the money or the
weather to get the top coat on.  I'm very concerned about the rust in
those areas getting worse throughout the winter.  So this leads me to
a couple of questions - Were I to pull these windows, repair the sheet
metal and replace the seals, what's the chance that I'd be able to
reuse the seals next spring when I'm ready to topcoat?  Would I be
better off taking care of these rust issues and letting it sit out or
investing that money in a car cover?  I probably can't afford both.
My preference would be to take care of the rust completely including
the topcoat and then getting a carport but, that is not among my
available choices.

Thanks much,
Ken
