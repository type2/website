Chris,

If this is anything like how VDO does their gauges, the black, and white
wire are for the gauge light. Then those two screw terminals (red and
white I believe) are probably where the coil/ground goes to. I could be
wrong, but this was my first impression when looking at the picture.

No replies so far.


Any thoughts on how to hook this tach up, or just to test and see if it 
works?

Christopher

Never owned a tach before, and one was in the blank clock spot when I
got the bus, but never worked or was never connected.

There seem to be only two wires coming out of it, what do these hook up
to? I would guess one to a ground and one to the coil maybe?

Here is a picture of the tach I have :
