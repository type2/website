&gt;I have a 71 Campmobile with an AH prefix 1600 that I
&gt;am rebuilding to go in
&gt;it. The worn cam that came out was a four bolt
&gt;dished-gear type. The oil
&gt;pump was, in my opinion, worn out (.010 clearance
&gt;between gears, cover
&gt;really scoredwhat is the correct cam/oil pump
&gt;configuration for this
&gt;engine? Does it matter whether I use a 3 or 4 bolt
&gt;cam, as long as the oil
&gt;pump matches? Will *any* pump fit my case, or are
&gt;there case oil passage
&gt;matching issues? Finally, how do I tell whether a pump
&gt;will match up with a
&gt;3 or 4 bolt cam?
&gt;&gt;
You can use either a 3 or 4 bolt cam as long as the oil pump matches.  Gene
Berg says that their blueprinted oil pumps can be used with both 3 and 4
bolt cams.  There are definate oil passage matching issues, especially with
some of the south of the border cases. A comparison of the depth of the key
from the mating surface of the pump should tell you which pump is which (the
4 bolt pump is deeper).
