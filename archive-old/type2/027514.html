Ok, well, I seem to have my carb problem fixed. the 60idle and 140mains had 
a great improvement over what I had. I still have some hesitation and pop 
right when the gas is pressed. I'm going to try F7 emulsion instead of the 
stocks tubes. It seems the advance isn't catching up to the amount of spark 
needed and fuel in the carbs (which results in the pop and hesitation?) Some 
people have expressed that I need to nix the 009 distributor I have because 
it doesn't have enough advance for me. I'm thinking about doing the whole 
pointless Pertronix thing. I would like some input to see what everyone 
thinks. Thanks!
    Also, I would like to say Kudos to &quot;Moe&quot; who helped out &quot;Ms. Jonz&quot; You 
know, that's what I really like about us VW folks. It seems we are tight nit 
and stick together! I think that's one of the reasons why I bought my bus as 
well.
