Subject: Re: [T2] Squeal/whistle in engine

I have a recently(well, a year ago) rebuilt 2.0L and when it gets warm 
it starts to whistle too! I can't for the life of me pinpoint where it's 
coming from, although it sounds like the left side too. I'm also very 
interested in any ideas.

&gt; I had to rebuild my engine (1973, 1700, single weber carb) last fall because 
&gt; one of the main bearings ceased, and now there is a fairly loud 
&gt; squeal/whistle when the engine is running. It seems to be coming from the 
&gt; left side of the engine.
&gt;
&gt; When I first fired up the engine and noticed the squeal (on the right side), I 
&gt; tightening the intake manifold nuts a bit more and that eliminated the squeal 
&gt; so I thought it was just intake leak, which made sense because my intake 
&gt; manifold studs were in really bad shape.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I finally got all the intake manifold studs replaced/fixed and got the 
&gt; nuts torqued down correctly but the squeal seems to be getting worse and now 
&gt; it's on the left side. Any ideas? My next thought was to take off the carb 
&gt; and intake manifolds and check the gaskets for proper seal...
