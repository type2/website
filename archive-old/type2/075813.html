Subject: Another 14&quot; AT- Timberline AT

Recently rated top SUV tire by Consumer Reports
after measuring braking distances, feeling the
ride, stopping in rain, etc.  Available in almost
every 14&quot; size you may desire for your bus:
LT195/75, P225/70, P205/70, LT27x8.5.  

http://www.bridgestone-usa_dot_com/products/datimat.htm

This looks to be a Bridgestone tire, branded
Timberline rather than Firestone to avoid recent
bad press.  Don't know if they are available at
Firestone stores, but they were at a discount
tire shop in my neck of the woods.
