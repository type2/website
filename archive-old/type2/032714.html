Subject: Re: valve cover leaks

Are your spring bails (The wires that hold the covers on) tight enough?
 You _shouldn't_ be able to put the wire in place over the cover
without a small lever.  If you can do it by hand, rebend/replace the
bails.

Fel-Pro makes very nice neoprene gaskets.  Ask your FLAPS.

Be sure that the gasket matches the cover.  some covers have a
projection on the narrow side that interferes with the wide part of
some gaskets.  Trim the gasket to fit.

Gasket glue on the cover side.  Permatex blue (and nothing else!) on
the head side.

&gt; &gt; Ive never seen this problem posted. 
&gt; 
&gt; I posted about it a couple of months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Im having trouble sealing my valve cover 
&gt; &gt;on one side, I first thought I had pushrod tube leaks  but its the
&gt; valve 
&gt; &gt;cover and It pours out.
&gt; &gt; The cover is not bent and I have made absolutely sure Ive got a
&gt; square seal 
&gt; &gt;and gasket in place. My next plan is to double up the gasket but b4
&gt; I do I 
&gt; &gt;was wondering if anyone else has had and rectified my problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried everything I could think of and eventually had to resort to
&gt; silicone sealant.  Finally stopped the leak though.
