Subject: Re: [T2] more starter interchangeability questions

Hi Kyle,

Again, I'm not as technically literate as Karl, but I can say I have
worked a lot with donor starters and mixed and matched a lot of
armatures and cases to get running starters.

Basically, if you've got the stuff, all you can do is check for
interchange fit. I found you need to watch for differences in length
of the case. Also some solenoids mount with a 3 screw pattern and
others with a two screw pattern, so those are not interchangeable.
Also I found when robbing watercooled VW's, some nose assemblies have
a different offset and will not bolt up to the transmission housing.

 Is it possible to replace the gear and shaft on the manual starter with the
 gear and shaft from the auto starter and use it on the auto tranny?  Or is
 it possible to replace the insides of the auto tranny starter with the
 insides from the manual tranny starter and use it on the auto tranny?
 
 Also, how about the solenoids, are they interchangeable?
 
 Thanks again,
 Kyle
