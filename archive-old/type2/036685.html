Subject: Removing steel panel behind front seats

Is it safe to remove the steel panel behind the front seats on my '72 Sportsmobile?  I would like to install the swivel seat bases from a Westy to open up the interior a bit when camping.  Did Westfalia do any kind of structural reinforcements in this area when they did their conversions?  When did VW quit putting these panels in '72-'79 buses, or are they in all passenger vans?

Thanks,
