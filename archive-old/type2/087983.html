Subject: Dixie Bus was the best




 Dear Fellow Tribesters,
 
 First of all, a big round of applause for Frank
 Biffath(Yeah!!!).  Great campground, tasty chili and
 breakfast, and the wonderful company of you fine
 people.   This is what all VW campouts should be. 
 Peaceful, relaxing, good music and good friends with
 the common love of V-Dubs.  If campfire making were
 and olympic event, Frank would win the gold.  Thanks
 also to Jon Baker and the 2 other fellows (cant
 remember their names, sorry!!) for the nice music they
 made.  Overally, I give it two thumbs up.  Frank, this
 was the first ANNUAL Dixie Bus Gathering (right?)???  
 
 Also thanks to Ted Finesman who followed us most of
 the way home, since we had a bum generator.  Question:
 How far can a bus go on a bad generator and a fully
 charged battery?  Answer:  In my case, at least 185
 miles, as that was the situation we faced.  Glad I
 brought my batter charger &quot;just in case someone needed
 it&quot;  not knowing the someone would be me.
 
 It was so great to meet all of you, so now I can put a
 face with the e-mail name.  If you are thinking about
 going to BNNTA in Hannibal, MO this labor day weekend,
 drop me a line.  Take Care.
