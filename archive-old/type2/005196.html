X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Well said, Mike und Herr Doktor..

It's sad but true that a great many VW mechanics/technicians, even those
that have been working on them for years, do not really _understand_ the
rationale behind various engineering features of the vehicles and their
engines.  They've &quot;learned by doing&quot;, but don't comprehend the &quot;whys&quot; behind
what they do [or don't do].

The person who built my latest 1600SP [dead stock, using the factory
original 1970 model year distributor, carburetor, etc.] insisted that
because it was based on a late '70s Beetle crankcase the engine HAD to be
timed to the specs for the case's model year.  I disagreed, and attempted to
explain why.  He hauled out his VW dealer shop manual and showed me the
tuneup specs for the mid '70s Bug 1600, angrily declaring that
confirmed that the year of the case dictated how the engine should be
setup/tuned.  Never mind, as well,  that those specs were for a DP engine
and mine is an SP.

I tried very patiently to explain that the case was, in effect, nothing more
than a specialized box to support and contain the really important bits and
pieces, and that those important bits and pieces are what determines how the
completed engine assembly ought to be setup and tuned.  The response was an
angry outburst and a threat to void the warranty on the engine if I didn't
accede to his superior and professional wisdom.

After a bit more discussion he agreed to install a VW crank pulley with a
factory TDC notch, in place of the mid-70s Bug pulley he'd initially
installed.  He was unhappy about that, as well, claiming he'd hunted high
and low before he found a factory-new pulley to match the crankcase.  He was
proud of his accomplishment, and considered me to be unappreciative of his
extra effort.  But he still insisted on timing the engine to the late Beetle
spec.

As I clearly was dealing with a closed and locked mind, I agreed to disagree
and retuned and timed [0*/TDC for the 1970 1600SP] the engine as soon as I
got it home [less than 5 miles of level city driving].

Over the ensuing year I had this person do the regular valve adjustments,
etc., on the engine to avoid jeopardizing the &quot;warranty&quot;.

A few weeks ago I took the bus to a new technician for a valve adjustment,
and he discovered that the single factory notch on the VW pulley was not at
TDC.  He showed me a small punch mark on the rear [Rear is Rear] flange of
the crank pulley, and based on that mark the big single notch is at ~7.5
degrees BTDC.  This means that all the valve adjustments done by the builder
were incorrect, as they were not done with the engine at TDC.  And it
explains why the builder always reported the valves to need minimal
adjustment to set them at
.006&quot;, but we found them all to be ~.004&quot; at the latest service.  It means
that the valve timing was off, as well.

I had been concerned that this engine was running a bit warmer than it
should, and that it just didn't seem quite right even after very careful
break-in and tuning.  And I'd encountered some pinging under certain
conditions, resolved by slightly retarding the ignition and changing to
premium fuel.  With the valves and ignition timing set correctly the engine
is running _much_ cooler, and finally feels &quot;right&quot;.  Too bad it had to take
~15,000 miles and nearly 2 years to sort things out.

Now, if I could just get my transaxle rebuilder to admit that he screwed up
and installed the wrong ring and pinion.....
