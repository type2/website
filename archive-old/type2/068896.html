Subject: Hi from Philly

Hello all. Here's an update on the continuing travails of the
Good Old Van, our '81 Westy. We visited her this morning at
the dealer in Harrisburg, PA. Well, she runs. But, now she
leaks oil. Guess the dealer put the new oil seal in crooked
or something like that :-(. But it looks like a slow leak,
and we'll monitor engine oil levels carefully on the way
back to Cleveland. Say a prayer for the Good Old Bus. We
take her back home tomorow.

Lisa
