yup ...it is your wheel bearings.  they are cheap and esy to replace.  but
must be packed with grease fully and correctly.  buy new seals while you are
in there......the alingment and tire balance can be done also....it is not
your problem..but do it anyways after replacing the bearings.....it will make
the front end be so smooth you wont believe it..........................let us
all know how it comes out
