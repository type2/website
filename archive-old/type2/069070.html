Subject: 050 distributor caps

Hi all-
Got a lot of email from folks looking for distributor caps for the Bosch 050
distributors besides me. For your lurkers out there, I have received exactly
one positive sighting. Thom Fitzgerald has seen caps for the 050 at
Wolfsburg West in Anaheim, California. I've also seen quite a few references
to the 050 in BMW circles. Might try the local BMW spot. If anyone has any
other sources, please post. There are a few desparate folks on the list.
