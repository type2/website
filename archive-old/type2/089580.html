Hi Greg,

    I think you should verify the cold oil pressure on starting, and be =
sure what's happening...........If you use a master oil pressure gauge, =
just screw into the oil sending unit outlet .........let the engine sit =
overnight...........with the gauge set up and ready to =
read...........have someone start the engine, while you watch the =
pressure gauge........ You should have pressure almost immediately.
    You need to know what's going on in there. If it is taking a full =
five seconds to read pressure, that's to long. If you have pressure, and =
your lifters are taking that long to build up, ok, if not it sounds like =
you have a bearing clearance problem, or the relief or by-pass valves =
could be sticking, etc.
    Any way run a cold and hot pressure test. At least you can put your =
mind to rest as to if you have a major worry or not!
    Good luck,

Tommy
