&gt;Larry (at GEX) put a small disk, about the size of a dime on the 
&gt;engine for
&gt;abuse detection... If the engine is overheated, the center of the 
&gt;disk
&gt;melts. This shows weather the engine has been mistreated or not.
&gt;

Yes, I remember that disk.  It fell off completely as my GEX engine 
was being installed.
