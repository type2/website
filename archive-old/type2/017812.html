&gt; I have a 1970 Deluxe Van.  I would like to know where the VIN # is located 
&gt; and how to &quot;translate&quot; it.

Hi Daniel,

The VIN # on American busses can be found on 4 spots:

- printed into the metal between the engine and the battery (1968-1971
busses)
- on the ID-plate behind the passenger seat
- on the production code plate (M-code plate) behind the drivers seat
- on the left side of the dashboard. American busses have a little metal
plate
  fixed on the dash so you can see through the windshield what the VIN
is. 
  European busses don't have this for some reason.

Since 1970 the VIN consist of 10 digits:

for example:

24 02 231 450

24 = model, in this case a deluxe microbus
0  = modelyear: 1970
2  = Unknown. This number is always a 2 (doesn't stand for type 2)
231 450 = serial number, this is the 231450th bus produced in 1970

For more info on bus numbers (VIN, color codes, M-codes) check out my
