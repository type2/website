Man, I would second that!  The first Bus I bought came with the engine
disassembled in the cargo bay.  I figured, &quot;OK, no problem!  Just like my
B*g engine!&quot;  Needless to say, at that time, I had never heard of, much less
SEEN at type IV engine.  One huge coffee can full of nuts, bolts, studs,
clips, screws, etc, etc.  I never did get that engine back together.
Finally broke down and rescued one from a wrecked 73 and overhauled it.  At
least now, I DO know what a Type IV looks like!
Take care.

&gt; Gillian:
&gt;
&gt; Very good suggestion.  Don't forget to label those wires when removing the
&gt; engine or playing with the elctrical system.
&gt;
&gt; A video camera is also great for documenting what something looked like
&gt; before being removed or disassembled. Don't try to rely on memory when
&gt; working on a Bus.

&gt;  When pulling off nuts and bolts from an engine...In the course of
&gt; rebuilding,
&gt;  it may be a long time before we put anything back together, so the labels
&gt; and
&gt; cardboard work wonders. (snip)
