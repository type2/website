THE WEEKLY TYPE2 / VINTAGEBUS LIST 'O SITES AND ETIQUETTE GUIDE!

Ok, folks, here's some sites that will be invaluable to the Type 2
newbie and oldtimer.  It was created to help reduce traffic on the
lists by providing a quicker way to get that crucial piece of
information that you need to fix your bus.  Always try to check these
sites before posting to the list.

TYPE2 LIST SITES:

The Volkswagen Bus Mailing List.  
This is the web site of the Type2 and Vintagebus lists.
http://www.type2_dot_com

The Type2 Archive.  
This lets you search everything that has been posted to type2 and
vintagebus since the Jurassic (almost) 
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/ 

The Type2 Library.  
This has links to hundreds of web pages dedicated to our favorite
vehicle.  It is nicely indexed, so you can go straight to the topic
you want to investigate.

LIST ETIQUETTE GUIDE:

When you subscribed to the list, The first thing you got was the
charter of the list.  Hopefully, you saved it for reference.  If you
didn^Òt, this is the short version:

1.  Post only about VW type 2s.  Allowable topics are technical issues
and buses and parts for sale/trade.
2.  On Fridays _ONLY_, the rules are loosened a bit to allow
discussion of any bus-related topic.  This is the day to post stuff
about bus toys, bus sightings, bus jokes, bus trips, etc.  Your
posting must still be about _buses_ though!  Friday threads end on
_Friday_.  If you feel the need to continue a &quot;Friday&quot; topic on
Saturday, do it via pmail, not on the list.
3.  If you can^Òt say anything nice about someone, don^Òt say anything
at all.  (Stolen from the movie &quot;Bambi&quot;, but applies here as well.) 
Ideas are fair game, but personal attacks or insults are verboten.
4.  The list isn^Òt a democracy.  It is a monarchy with the list
administrator wearing the crown.  Annoy the admin at your own peril. 
When the admin says to kill a thread, it^Òs dead!


NOTES:

I^Òve eliminated the long bus site listing, as most of those sites were
available (and much better indexed) from the Type2 Library above.  If
you feel a need have them here weekly, or have any other suggestions,
let me know.
