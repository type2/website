Subject: Re: [valves]

Jeff,
The only reason there is any 'valve lash' at all is so when the engine gets
hot and everything expands, it goes to zero.

More clearance between the adjuster and stem means more room for the stem to
stretch, which is okay, but too much means a noisy valve train, premature wear
on stems, valve guides and adjusters (over extended use) and a *slight* drop
in performance.  
Some people believe that extremely high valve clearance - like .025&quot;  will
result in an engine that won't rev very high, but will provide stump-pulling
torque at low RPM.  It sounds a little fishy to me, but it would be fun to try
on an old beater sometime...probably the same type4 i'll try to duct-tape a
set of dp 1600 heads to...you know, just to see...

Loose valves are better than tight anyday.  .008&quot; is just gonna be a little
noisy and shouldn't hurt anything and might be better for a worn engine that
might be running hotter than it should- but follow your Bentley or your
owner's manual if you want to be right.
Hopefully i just referred to two publications you currently possess...

&gt; Hi people:
&gt;     I am about to do a tune up on my bus and vaguely recall some one on the
&gt; list writing that they set their valves to .004 on intake and .006 on the
&gt; exhaust (or vice versa). I would be curious to know if there are any
&gt; advantages or disadvantages to doing this. Also, The PO said that he set
the
&gt; 1600dp engine in my '69 Westy to .008. Does this seem reasonable?
&gt; Thanks for any info,
&gt; Jeff Mitchell
&gt; '69 Westy
