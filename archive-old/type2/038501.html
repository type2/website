If it does not say C it can still have the correct load rating. If you have modern tires they can say something like 195/75-14R94. Here the last two digits (94) are the load rating. 
I am not sure how it works exactly, but the higher the number the higher the load rating. I know that 94 is enough for a bus (accepted by German TUV). 
I am not sure about the 92 Toyos mentioned in the original post. 
You also want to check whether you have a reinforced sidewall. It should say something like reinforced or list the number of plies and the material.

&gt; I have a 77 Westy (lime green). Decided to buy new rubber, so I read 
&gt; everything anybody had to say about tires on type2. Armed with this info, I

&gt; sidewalls.
&gt; 
&gt; He says he has a Toyo tire, grade C made for light trucks and SUV's. So he 
&gt; installs them today (great deal all 4 installed/balanced $210), I pick it up 
&gt; and I find the tires are not C rated. They turn out to be Toyo 185/75R14 
&gt; 92S.
&gt; 
&gt; I confront him on this and he says they're C rated and have reinforced 
&gt; sidewalls.

If it doesn't say &quot;C&quot;, it isn't &quot;C&quot;
The bus specs a minimum load rating of 1540 pounds, which translates to a
185R14 load range C tire or a 195/75R14 load range _D_ tire.  C load range
isn't strong enough in a 195/75.

A load range &quot;c&quot; tire should have a higher pressure rating than 35PSI.
Something in the 45 range is more like it.

Don't feel too bad, as I made the same mistake when I bought tires.  Tire
dealer talked me into the tires he happened to have in stock, not the
right tires for the vehicle.  Since they were overloaded, they wore out
fairly quickly so I could replace them with the proper size Bridgestones.
