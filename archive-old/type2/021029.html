Subject: newer engine case??

Hey volks. I just picked up a '60 bug, and it has what I
believe is a newer brazill case. it has no engine numbers on
the case, and on the bottom of the case on the drivers side
it does say AS-41 along a string of other numbers. (I can go
get them and post them if it makes it easier). is this a
&quot;new&quot; braz case? it is already drilled and tapped for a bus
mount. also, the po drilled into the case on the drivers
side and put what looks like 2 brass 90 degree compression
plumbing fittings, with the male end threaded into the case,
and the compression end with 3/8 or so, flex copper pipe
going to an external oil cooler. hehe, some things people do
make me wonder, but man, this can't be right! could I just
put some pipe plugs the same size into those holes and plug
them off, maybe drop some loctite on the threads to make
sure they don't vibrate out? What is the purpose for the po
doing this? Is this what you would call drilling the case
for &quot;full flow&quot; oil cooling? I&quot;ve never messed with any type
of oil coolers or sumps before so this is new to me. (geez,
and I live in phx!) any input on this one would be great!!
Thanks again for your help, you guys are truly unique! -Mark
