&gt; My family keeps telling me about a new movie, the trailer, showing a bus...I
&gt; believe it's a Steve Martin movie, but I am not sure.
&gt; FWIW

they are getting more out there. here are a few I have seen recently:

the steve martin &quot;cheaper by the dozen&quot; movie trailer

that commercial where stuff seems to change right in it's spot, kinda
like a slide show. One of the vehicles it flips to is a red splity. I
think it might be a cell phone comercial, but not sure.

My son yelled to me last sat from the other room to come and look at
the tv. I was in the middle of soldering something so I missed it, but
apparently there was a bus in a power rangers tv show. Before leaving
for work yesterday I caught a glimpse of a shot of the main characters
sitting in the cab of a bay window of some sort, no exterior shots,
but he was right about the bus.
