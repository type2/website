Subject: Just Outta Curiosity........

Hiya Listees,

I really don't expect a definitive answer to this question, but I'd really be 
interested in what other bus pilots think.  

When I was renewing my dash I pulled apart the instrument cluster with the 
gas gauge and the warning lights.  

Of the four warning lights only the highbeam indicator had (what appeared to 
be) a &quot;blinder&quot; in it.  This small piece of black plastic fit in the 
indicator light opening perfectly and had a small hole in the center.  The 
net effect was that, when the high beams were on, the &quot;blinder&quot; would allow 
only a small circle of light to show on the blue lens.  The other three 
indicator lenses all light up totally.  So...........why the &quot;blinder&quot; effect 
for the highbeam indicator?

Just outta curiosity, what'cha think?
