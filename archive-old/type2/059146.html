Subject: Seabelts for rear seated passengers

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

I am purchasing a 1973 Devon Type 2. I have two children, one of which is 8 weeks old and in a large car seat. I cannot find any information regarding the fitment of seatbelts in rear of the vehicle and don't want to take the kids out until this has been rectified. I am looking to install three point belts rather than laptops.

Any help would be appreciated. This is my first message posted to the group, so please forgive me if this is already a well discussed topic.
