Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

I would say a rod in a tube...  Anyway, the bellows go on the front and back
of the tube.  Only place I found them was BD (which probably means WCM)

&gt; --Dave,
&gt;
&gt; since I've got your attention, I've been rereading this post of yours the
last few days, having bought the bushings and done the front of my 76
already...

&gt; There is a small round &quot;ring&quot; looking bushing at the front of the front
rod.
&gt;
&gt; --right, the front shift rod goes thru it (on later models only)
&gt;
&gt; Next should be a rubber bellows that goes around the tube that the
&gt; rear rod is supported in by the 3(yes 3!) plastic bushings inside the tube
that support the rear rod.
&gt;
&gt; --where is this bellows (mine is missing) in relation to the midpoint
screw coupler? Also, the rear rod is a 'rod in a rod'? I thought the front
and rear coupled together and went straight to the tranny?
