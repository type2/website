I like this idea.  I just find it hard to trust my jack stands (even 
though they are Sears specials) so I leave my hydraulic jacks underneath 
for added protection.  But I've often thought of making some gizmo I can 
put the car on and then put some heavy duty caster wheels on it so I can 
roll the whole car around on the driveway.  If I had a forklift though, 
I'd just lift the whole up. :-)
