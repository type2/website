At work, we use a mixture of chainsaw bar oil, automatic transmission fluid,
and 10w30 motor oil to under coat cars..........

&gt; I recently bought a quart of chainsaw Bar oil with the intention of
&gt; spraying it under my bus for rust prevention per an article I read on the
&gt; WWW. I wanted to use a air-energized spraycan for this. Trouble is, the oil
&gt; is so darn thick I can't get it to do anything but ooze out of the spray
&gt; nozzle. Is there a good solvent to thin this stuff out some?? Gasoline??
&gt; mineral spirit? Kerosene?
