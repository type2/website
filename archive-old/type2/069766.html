Doug:

You need to let the air-cooled audience know HOW you achieve 70 in the bus!

A certain final gear ratio/Tire circumferance formula you'd like to share...

i guess i must add that i could pull 70 in my first splittie, Gus, an early
59.  he had a *split case* tranny, 1600 H case sp with a weak #3, and 14&quot; bus
tires.        and got 30mpg.   

no, i did not regulary drive 70.  just once (in my younger,wilder days) when
i was in a rush to get to Cupertino from San Francisco.  i didnt have the
pedal to the metal, either.   that bus was amazing.   too bad it was falling
to bits.    now its rusting in maryland, if it hasnt been squished (sob)

and my 61 non sunroof deluxe im sure could go 70, but since i didn't want to
wind it out i kept it to 60.    new 1600 SP w/doghouse, 67 trans, 205P15
tires.
