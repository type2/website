&gt;hello again,
&gt;
&gt;well i posted my gauge question the other day, however
&gt;i suppose no one saw fit to answer it. so i'm forced
&gt;to ask again.
&gt;
&gt;-what should cyl. head temp be?

No specs published in Bentley that I recall. Oil temp is the spec given in=
=20
Bentley. I think it states in several places for various test and=20
adjustment procedures that Operating OIL Temperature is 100=B0 C which =3D=
 212=B0 F.



&gt;-what should oil temp be?

Under 190=B0 is a bit cool for maximum energy production, you are giving up=
=20
efficientcy/gas milage. Over 230=B0 some concerns are at issue, all of which=
=20
can be taken care of by reducing the oil change interval.  If your hitting=
=20
250=B0, you will break down the long chains of hydrocarbons very fast and=
 are=20
at risk of damage. Even so, if you changed the oil everytime it got into=20
that temp range for more than a few miles running, lubrication would be=20
maintained. If you are too hot, do verify there are no leaks in the cooling=
=20
air system. Cut up an old innertube to make seals for any holes in the tin=
=20
or shroud. Glue them in place with Barge Cement or similar adhesive. Even=20
duct tape will do in a pinch, but won't last very long due to heat cycling.=
=20
If that doesn't drop temps, you are not spec, ie, running too lean and/or=20
timing advanced more than spec and/or overspec compression and/or bad fuel=
=20
and/or............something(s) is/are out of spec.



&gt;-what should oil pressure be?

On a newly assembled motor, after initial breaking in, with the proper=20
weight oil for ambient temps, I expect to see at the very least 15 lbs at=20
hot idle, with 20lbs+ not unusual. At 2 grand or more hot, I expect to see=
=20
at least 35 lbs and normally 40+ lbs. 3 bar is ding dang decent=20
(3x14.7=3D44psi). You can bet the spec is in Bentley, but I don't have it=20
here and I am not your Mother. Get the Bentley. Then you can tell me when I=

post something contrary I am full of s**t. Sometimes I am.
