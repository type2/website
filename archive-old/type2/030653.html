Subject: 82 Update #3!!

Found a problem.

No power to #10 on the ECU harness.  should have 12v when the key is one.
(#4 has ~10, but hell, the starter is running then!) and #20 has 12 with
the air sensor open..

So.  I start reading thses bastard flow wiring charts to figure out where
the problem lays.  (other then fuses.  All good.  Pass visible and
continuity)

I'll note here that she hit a deer earlier this week, or perhaps last
week. Make that earlier last week, or the week before.  Just bumper, but
still a decent shock.  Mighta knocked something loose, or started
something , loose.

Letcha'll know....david
