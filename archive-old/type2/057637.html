Subject: West dash panel replacement
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Multi &quot;cartural&quot; question...
I have a 1972 Westy... I have a 1987 Toyota Celica GTS...
The Toyota is available for parts. The Toy dash has all the gauges I
wish my West had.

Question: is it possible to make it work (using the Toy dash and 
gauges in place of the Vw's)??? 

I think that fitting the Toyota dash panel to the West is possible 
(with some work... evidently),  but my question is about connecting 
or adapting the speedometer, the oil pressure gauge, the engine temp, 
the fuel gauge the tachometer and the idiot lights. 
Is that possible???  Any adaptor necessary? If so are they 
available? Has anyone already done that? Any advice.... 

Thank you
