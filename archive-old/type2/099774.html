&gt;There is also the question that if the lifters are always pressed

&gt;so, due to the wear that takes place. 

I have seen a lot more wear on solid-lifter cams than hydraulic.  The hydraulic cams always seem to look like new.  The hydraulic cam in my engine has well over 100k miles on it and last time I looked at it (admittedly it was a few years ago) it showed no visible wear at all.
