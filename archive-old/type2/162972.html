Subject: Re: [T2] tow bar opinons

&gt;Anybody have any opinions or experience with the tow bars on the Samba?
&gt;
&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=280516

	Let me point out the ambiguity in the term 'tow bar'.  In 
some parts of the world 'towbar' means a quasi-permanent addition to 
the frame offering a tow ball in the midline just outside the *rear* 
bumper, allowing you to tow a trailer.  The item shown at the above 
URL is to latch onto that, and fit onto the front of the towed 
vehicle.
