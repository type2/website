Circuit 15 is key on power.
Circuit 30 is key off power.
Circuit 50 is starter engage power.

Circuit 30 is the big post on the starter solenoid.
The 2 spades on the top right are both circuit 50. It does not matter if you
put the crank signal wire from the ignition switch on the left or right one.
They are tied together.

The lower one is not used.


&gt; 3.Apparently I have fuel pump wires switched from
&gt; terminals 30/50 at the solenoid, but I can't
&gt; tell which terminals are which on the solenoid.
&gt; The battery cable goes to 50, but which of the
&gt; little pins (I have 3, 2 top, one bottom) is 30?
&gt;
&gt; ......................Those 3 little mystery pins are giving me headaches
&gt; also. I am having this same problem rewiring my 76 Westy, getting the
&gt; engine back together after a rebuild. And no one has answered your question
&gt; yet about the 3 mystery blades (pins). If you get an answer, please relay
&gt; it to me. From under the car, looking up at the starter, I can feel two
&gt; connection blades at the top of the solenoid, and I can see one connection
&gt; blade at the lower edge of the solenoid. I am guessing that the wire to the
&gt; double relay goes on one blade, and the wire to/from the ignition goes on
&gt; the other. But which goes where, and does it really matter? I don't have
&gt; anything connected to the lower blade.  I tried swapping between the two
&gt; top blades, but it didn't seem to help anything. I can make my engine run
&gt; for 8 seconds, and then it leans out and dies.  Won't idle. It is running 8
&gt; seconds on the cold start valve I think. That is where I am on this
&gt; thing.....hope someone answers you.  I also think we need a reference
&gt; terminology for the two top blades. Looking up from the ground at the
&gt; starter, let's name the blades 'passenger-side' and
&gt; 'driver-side.'   Eventually we can substitute 30 and 50 for those names
&gt; when we get some answers. Or maybe they are both the same number, and the
&gt; 'lower blade' is 30 or 50.
