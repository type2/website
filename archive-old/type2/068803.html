Subject: Strokes, cycles

        Strokes are movement in a single direction- &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot; in our
case. (By an antique convention we call a piston at the limit
of its travel away from the crank 'Top Dead Center'. 'Out Dead Center'
would be more accurate. Just like a V engine, a flat-four has two
'top-ends', but the 'bottom' is in the middle. Hmmm.)

        So a 4 stroke, 'Otto cycle' engine has four *linear* piston
movements: From TDC, they are Combustion (down/in), Exhaust (up/out),
Intake (down/in) and Compression (up/out).

        Sorry West, I mistrust the use of 'cycle' and a number to 
describe this or the related 2 stroke business ( Combustion + Exhaust down/in,
Intake + Compression up/out) 'Cycle' implies circularity or a
recuring series of motions or elements- so there are four strokes in
the cycle of some engines and two strokes in the cycles of some engines
but what a 2-cycle or 4-cycle engine might be is not clear. 4 strokes
ARE 2 cycles. 
        A wise-guy would expect a 2-cycle engine to be EITHER 2 stroke
or 4 stroke :)

        Work calls!
        Bill
