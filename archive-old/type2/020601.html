Subject: Compression test.  What next?

Listees,

I finally got around to testing the compression in my new to me 1972
Westy (1700 cc dual carb)   As predicted cylinder # 3 was bad.  The
results were cylinder  # 1:  140lbs, cylinder 2: 130lbs Cylinder # 3:
0lbs and number 4 only 120lbs.

I have two questions: What should I do or check next to get my bus
running on all four?

and

Is the difference between cylinders 120 -140lbs ok?

I have checked the archives and there appears to be several different
suggestions.

Thanks

Craig
