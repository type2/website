Also, any sugestions on how to best jack the bus up?  I used the engine as a jack-point last time, but of course the engine isn't there now.

--I wouldn't use the engine as a jack point, the bus should be jacked up and carry the engine with it, not vice versa. 

The jack points for the original jacks are the square in cross section channels behind the front wheels and in front of the back wheels. I put my floor jack on these as well, till the jackstands come out. Always get the bus on jackstands and make sure to block your wheels as well.
