Subject: Advice on buying VW bus's?

Hi,
    I am very eagar to buy a VW bus but dont know if am going
to fast on trying to find one.
First a bit about myself...
I am 19 and I would like to work or restore a VW bus.
I dont mind putting in many hours into the bus I buy.
Just as long as the project doesnt take more than 8 months
to aleast get it on the road. I am not stupid around cars but
I am not sure whats to much for me.

My question is what advice could other VW onwers give on buying?
Buy a $500 bus fix it up and put in a new engine and maybe trans.
Buy a $2k bus and do alittle work.
I would reather spend $500 and put more work in than cash
yes I do know replacing the parts can be expensive.
I dont mind spending $3k on the finshed thing.
I really not totaly not interested in fully restoring it
right away.
I would also really like to be able to overhaul the engine some
day, body work, and interoir work.

I live in Nashville, TN and there doesnt seem to be alot of
bus's around here or for sale.

Looking for a bus in the year range of 65-78

Thanks in advance
Alex Wisniewski,
