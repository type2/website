Subject: RE: [T2] brake booster hose

I could not find a supplier of hose that is built not to collapse under
vacuum, so what I did was go to home depot and purchased a long spring that
would fit inside standard VW hose. I stretched the spring to the length I
needed and slid it inside the hose. Now it won't collapse. I suppose you can
do the same thing with 1/2 inch heater hose.
