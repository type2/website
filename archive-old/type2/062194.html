Y'know, this is how I wind up feeling every time I answer a &quot;split&quot;
question :-)

Nope, not on the T4 engine, they don't. The pushrods tubes slide in
through the head while the head remains in place.  Sealing is via o-rings,
not the tapered gaskets used on the T1 engine.

&gt;  Hey everybody!!
&gt;
&gt;  I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil
&gt; stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could
&gt; any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through
&gt; the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them? What
&gt; sealant should I use?

To get a leak-free push-rod tube you will need:

the following parts:

        new pushrod tubes;
        new small O-rings to go on the inner end;
        new big O-rings to go on the outer end;
        new valve cover gaskets.

        I recommend O-rings made of &quot;viton&quot; if you can find them.

the supplies:

        motor oil for O-rings and gaskets;
        paper towels,
        a bit of cleaning fluid.

        I, suicidal maniac that I am, use gasoline; you may use what you like.

the tools:

        a big screw driver or a small pry bar,
        a metric socket set or wrench set;
        dull razor blade.

The steps:

1) remove the valve cover.  Use the screwdriver or pry bar.

2) remove the rocker shaft.  3 10mm nuts (as I remember) and it is loose.
Loosen each nut 1/2 turn and move to the next so as not to put too much
strain on the shaft.  After the nuts are off, the the shaft and rocker
arms come off as a unit.  *KEEP THEM THAT WAY*.  Off the bus, they can
slide off the shaft, so be a little careful that they don't.

3) remove the pushrods.  I am anal enough that I try to keep them in
order.  I am not sure it's important, but I do.

4) remove the copper wire bail that holds the pushrod tubes down. (This
may have come off with the rocker arms, if so, good enuff)

5) remove the old pushrod tubes.  Grab them between the head and block and
twist and push them away from the block.

6) Clean the seats.  Probably the most important step in the whole
procedure, you  have to get the seats at both the block and head ends
sparkling.  I use a rag or paper towel dipped in gasoline.  try not to
leave any of the cloth or paper in the engine :-)  Seeing the block end of
things is a bit difficult.  I use a dentist's mirror I happen to own, a
compact mirror will also work, but the idea is to have shiny aluminum
all the way around.

7) new O-rings on new push rod tubes is next in importance.   While the
old tubes can theoretically be reused, I have had much better luck with
new tubes.  Dip the new o-rings in oil before putting them on the tube.

8) slide the pushrod tube in from the head toward the block.  Grab it with
your hand and rotate/push it into place.  DO NOT USE ANY TOOLS!  the tube
is very soft and if you deform it, it *will* leak!  In fact, be careful
how hard you grab it...

9) pushrods back in, pushrod tube bail in, and rocker arm on.  I have no
secret on getting the pushrods all in their cups, and the pushrod tube
bail into place.  Note that the bail sits on the ends of the pushrod tubes
*not* down inside them! Its just a case of mechanical design having
outstripped evolution.  You need more hands than you have.  Reinstall the
rocker arm nuts as you removed them, a bit at a time.

10) new valve cove gasket on and reinstall valve cover.  use an old razor
blade to remove the old gasket if the DPO used permatex or suchlike to
install it.  make sure the seat is clean and the face of the head too.
You do not need permatex for this gasket.  Doesn't hurt, you just don't
need it, the cover clips will hold it in place long enough.  coat both
sides of the gasket in oil before installation.  Getting the bail down
over the cover is a bear.

Done.  Let me know if you have any questions.
