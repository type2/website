Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start update

BIG spark no clunk. I did NOT try whacking the solenoid with 
a hammer. The starter does not spin when I bridge the two 
large posts on the solenoid.

Thanks,
Chris

Time for a new Starter?

Bridging the 2 large posts should get the starter to spin. 
The starter will never engage the flywheel unless you 
energize the solenoid. The solenoid moves the starter drive 
out to the ring gear before it runs the starter motor.
Jump from the battery post on the solenoid to the top right 
push-on terminal.
1) Do you just get a small spark?
If yes, solenoid is bad.
2) Do you get a large clunk and the starter does not spin?
If yes, either the solenoid or the starter is bad.
To test if it is the solenoid, get a voltmeter and see if 
you have 12v at the
lower large post [the one with the braided wire]. If you 
have 12v, the starter is bad.

Now bridge the 2 large posts:
If the starter spins when you jump the 2 large posts, it may 
be good.
If the starter does not spin when you jump the 2 posts, it 
is bad.
