Subject: '81 Vanagon starting woes
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990420091717.00a43d80_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

My '81 Vanagon has been having some problems (cold) starting after its
winter storage...  the engine turns over fine, but within a couple of
seconds it just dies.  After five or six tries, the engine will idle very
low for about 10 seconds, then rev up to normal idle speed.  Once the
engine is warm, this problem disappears.  I've searched previous digests
for similar symptoms (although I couldn't seem to find this exact
problem)... here is what I've come up with:

The cold start valve seems to work fine as it only operates when you crank
the starter
The aux air regulator is woking fine (open when cool)
Temp sensor 1 has a resistance of 2500 ohms

Any other ideas here?  The problem is starting to get a little annoying and
I had to put any more stress on my starter than necessary.  Thanks much!
