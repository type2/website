Subject: Re: [T2] doors

From Neal:

IN a local Upull junkyard I have found a 87 Vanagon and have removed the front door and rear hatch for my 81
Vanagon I wanted to also take the sliding door  but was told that will no exchange is their any way to make it
work thanks?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Measure your sliding door front to rear and then measure the 87 door.

The sliding window is shorter by 30mm on the 85+ door.  Is the door shorter by 30mm??

Here is the dimensions of the sliding door window:

80-84  1073.5mm x 419mm

85+  1043.5mm x 419mm
