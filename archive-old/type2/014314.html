&gt; Any leads on how to find one of those tents that attaches to the

Hey there Lori,

Welcome to the list.

Search all the online vw classifieds (some links are on my webpage,
addy in sigline below). Check ebay. But most importantly of all goto
your local vw shows. I've seen lots of tents for sales at prices from
$175-650 at the shows in my area. Someone at the Terryville CT had a
nice tent for $200 (said &quot;come back at the end of the show, and make
me an offer&quot;). The tent was excellent, but the poles (curved corner
peices) needed to be repaired/welded. 

The westy side tents are *not* rare at all. I see them all the time.
They *are* desirable, so everyone and their uncle is looking for one
to buy. If you are patience enough, you'll find a decent tent at a
decent price (IMHO decent price = $250-450, I paid a little over $300
for mine w/ shipping included).

A eastcoast listmember recently had posted a side tent for sale on
the list at a *very* nice price, so there are good deals out there.

If your not hung up on the vintage look of an original, check out :

Also check out Joe's tent page for more info on the original tents

Hope this helps,
