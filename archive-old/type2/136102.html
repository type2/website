Subject: Re: [T2] Difference between 1971 vs. 1968 Engines

&gt; I have a 68' with a stock SP 1600.  That engine needs a rebuild, and since

&gt; AE 300194) and swapped engines yesterday no problem.  My question is, what
&gt; are the differences between the two engines that I need to know about.

You've already noted the pressed-in mount bolt on the bellhousing flange
to take a bolt from the front.

The reason for this is that the '71 has a doghouse cooler that makes
getting at that nut rather difficult.  The cooler needs to have a duct
that passes through the '71-only front engine tin, so make sure that those
parts are in place.  If you leave the duct off and simply dump the oil
cooler air in the engine bay you will compromise your cooling system.
