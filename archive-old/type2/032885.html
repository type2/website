Subject: looking for some parts

i'm on the lookout for some parts for my '71 westy. if you know of anyone
who might have this stuff for sale, let me know:

1) replacement front seats, from newer model bus. i want the high back seats.

2) the wraparound step-thing for the front bumper, drivers side. this is
the side step that seems to attach to the front bumper below the turn
signal. mine was crunched by some jerk in a really dumb accident a few
months ago. I'd rather just replace this section than the whole bumper, if
possible.

3) [really minor] the overhead compartment from the '71 westy interior, the
one that starts above the bench seat and goes back. even better, detailed
measurements of this cabinet would be cool, since i can build it myself
pretty cheaply.

i think that's it. None of these things are really critical, but they're
things i'd like to get in the next few months.
