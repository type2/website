Subject: to cool-tin, or too-cool tin?

Dear Volks,

	My &quot;new&quot; '70 bus is to be delivered in just under a week, and I'm
getting set to do an engine pull first thing so that I can tend to some
tweaked spark plug holes and install missing tin &amp; thermostat pieces.

	The engine currently has the so-called &quot;cool-tins&quot; which apparently
first appeared on Type IIIs.  Further, it's missing the three pieces of tin
(two on one side, one on the other) that reside under the pushrod tubes.
It's a relatively stock, low-compression single-port engine with a doghouse
cooler.

	I would like to return to a very-close-to-original tin/cooling
configuration.  I will be installing the pieces of tin under the pushrod
tubes.  Should I remove the &quot;cool-tins&quot; and substitute the stock air
deflector plates?

	The bus will see some cold (Michigan) weather operation.  I suspect
that I don't need the fancier cool-tins, and that warmup will be achieved
more quickly with the smaller stock deflector plates.  (It may never warm
up at -5F, for all I know!)

	I know that we tend to think that cooler is better, but I'd like to
strike a balance.  I suspect that the stock-as-a-rock system will give me
the best performance over the widest range of conditions for this climate
(-5F to 95F, sea level, moderately humid summer).  Do any of you have any
feedback, suggestions, or direct experience with the two varieties of air
deflector plates?  Please share your thoughts!

Cheers,
-Greg
