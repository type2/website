Subject: re: strange oil leak and flushant


re: oil leak from dipstick

have you considered seeing if you've got the correct dipstick?  maybe it's
the wrong size by a little.  i might be temped to leave it... as my
philosphy is always that if it works ok, don't fix it.  the truth is that
almost all vw's leak a little bit, we just have to be polite about where we
park.  but keep in mind the big rules for everyone :

THE BIG VW RULES TO REMEMBER, ALWAYS
(1) keep the motor cool (sometimes it's tough ie: central american mountain
climbs with the westy going uphill for 2 days, but just stop often)
(2) if EVER your oil light comes on STOP IMMEDIATELY (don't try to push it
even 50 feet to the nearest gas station, ask how i know)
(3) adjust your valves once in a while, especially on long trips. (learn to
do it yourself with 10$ of tools)

follow this advice and your bus should take you wherever you need to go.
oh, and make sure your battery is well attached and won't rust out - and
always keep an extra box of oil bottles handy on long trips, just in case).
it doesn't matter if your bus is a rust bucket from jah or showroom
quality, the basics remain the same.

i recommend a 20w50 if you can get it.  protect your motor better and maybe
leak a bit less.

the rest we can learn as we go and need to.  after all, we drive vw's so we
can't be in too much of a hurry, eh?
