correct but you may have your meter set too high as it is only 2500 omhs
at 68 degrees and falls to below 250 at normal operating temp

&gt; Should the ignition be on ? because I get a reading of  0

nope not neccessary

&gt; should I be going from the connection to connection ( where I
disconnected)

no you were doing it right
