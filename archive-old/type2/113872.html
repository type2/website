Thought someone here might be interested in this for their bus...

&gt;From: Ron Boley &lt;ronboley_at_optonline_dot_net&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If anyone is interested in a completed MegaSquirt kit I have one for sale.
&gt;The kit of parts and case was $100.00. The Stimulator to test it was another
&gt;$35.00.   I assembled it (I can solder...) and tested it.  Both pieces are
&gt;available for $150 if anyone is interested.
