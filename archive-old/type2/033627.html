&gt;I have noticed alot of talk recently about electric fuel pumps (FACET).
&gt;A word of advice:  if you use one also but a pressure regulator ($15),
&gt;and install it inline after the pump.  Often aftermarket fuel pumps
&gt;provide too much pressure to the carb, a 1600cc single carb requires
&gt;onlt 1 lb.  the facet provides 5-6 lbs..  This, in my case, caused all
&gt;the seals in gaskets in my carb to blow out and hyrdrolocked my engine
&gt;as all the excess gas leaked down into the cylinders.

I recently measured the output of my new Brazilian fuel pump (intended for
carbs) at over 10psi.  To fix this I went to Jegs and bought a Holley fuel
pressure regulator - about $25.  It's a nice looking piece with a single
input and dual output, which works out very well for the dual carbs.  It
comes in two varieties, one of which is adjustable from about 3-7 psi and
the other from 1-3 psi.  I bought the latter, installed it a couple weeks
ago and unhooked the noisy facet pump (but left it there in case of
emergency).  Ahhh, nice quiet fuel delivery once again, with no leaks and
no overpressure.  I mounted the regulator to the firewall/fuel tank cover
plate - be careful not to drill deeply and use short screws so as not to
puncture the tank!
