Subject: timing, wrong year engine

Hello again,
I just wrote the list about the timing on a 78 engine and I
just came across the engine codes at the archive and found this.
My engine code is GE043870 and I -thought- it was a 78 engine.
PO didnt know if the engine was replaced or not....

GE              1979           2000 (California only, Vanagon heads)

and then found this
GE      51 Kw   70 Hp   1970 cc 2       08/'75&gt;04/'79

which doesnt say california next to it.
But acroding to muir's it seems to be a AUG 78 engine
but there is a extra 0 in after the GE in muirs book so I am
not certain thats right.

So what I am trying to figure out now is what is the CORRECT timing.
Do I time it as 7.5o BTDC or 5 ATDC for california???
Or time it as a 78 engine acording to muir's which is 7.5o BTDC

Alex,....very confused
