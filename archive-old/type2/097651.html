Hi Don,

    I agree with David, if its a new Bus to you change/check all the fluids
just to be safe. See how black the brake fluid is also, if its black flush
it too.
    If its a standard, drain and change, if its automatic, drop the pan,
clean the screen, look for &quot;Junk&quot; and re-fresh the ATF fluid. Remember the
automatics have final drive fluid also. With out starting a war about
fluids, it takes a 90 wt type fluid just like a standard shift, be it
synthetic, 80/90 wt, etc, make your own choice there.
    Bess will &quot;Thank the maker&quot;, for the oil bath! Enjoy the new Bus.
