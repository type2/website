Subject: How to find TDC- Update!!

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to sincerely thank you for the advice regarding my '74 non-starting
problem.  It is now up and roaring!!!

Andy wrote a great e-mail which finally made everything clear to me.... I
want to quote Andy here for the archives as his letter, along with all the
great advice from you guys, helped me solve the problem.

Andy says:

&quot;beware. all distributors are not the same. some are 180 degrees backward
(using the 'notch' as a reference)
also you cant trust that the drive gear is in right.

find tdc. if you cant do it with the marks then pull the plug on #1,
stick a pencil or stick in there and rotate the engine until you find the
top.
#1 firing position is at TDC when both valves on #1 are closed. The rotor
will need to point to the wire for #1 then. Regardless of notches or
position of the distibutor.
The wires go round the cap clockwise 1432.
that should get you close enough to set the timing.&quot;

My distributor is 180 degrees off.  So after finding TDC using the both
valves closed on #1 method,
I adjusted the wires accordingly and it started right up!!

To my dismay though, I didn't realize there were crush seals between the
heat exchangers and the heads, I now have huge exhaust leaks from underneath
the engine!

Oh well, at least it's running now and I can replace the seals after the
holiday...

Thanks again guys!

-Tom
