I'm looking for the stock distributor for my '81 California Vanagon.  It is
a vacuum advance Bosch 0 237 022 009.  This was used in the '79, calif. bus
and '80, '81, '82, 83 calif. vanagon (maybe others as well).  Anyone out
there parting out one of these models?  I'll also consider a new one, but
would prefer to save as much $ as possible.
