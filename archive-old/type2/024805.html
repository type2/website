Wondering...should I simply NOT drive w/ a potentially leaking oil cooler,
even if I keep oil in there? Work is a scant 4 miles away and I'm wondering if
this is like a seal where as long as you keep oil in there all's smokey, but
well.
heh, I ask because it's gonna be gorgeous today and I'm still itching to be
behind that big ole wheel!
tonight I'm taking out the sender in hopes that is the problem. Wouldn't that
be great!?
Britt, your offer is hugely generous and I will, oh yes, contact you again
after the sender pull. 'Mona parks each night under a carport, last stall
which is good, and it is pretty much level. I am still trying to come up with
a vacant garage via a friend, but chances are it'll be here, in the carport.
Thanks, thanks, and thanks again* Aside from helping keep my second best girl
on the road, this list also, each day, renews my faith in humanity.
Y'all are the nicest folks.
Rachel
