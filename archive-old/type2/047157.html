&gt; Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
&gt;  better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering
&gt;  wheel (when i was driving and going straight)has a bar
&gt;  across it that was in the mostly horizontal position. 
&gt;  Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
&gt;  degree angle.  I'm under the impression that this is
&gt;  not normal.  The only thing that happened between the
&gt;  last time I drove her and today was that my roommate
&gt;  moved it out of the driveway so she could get her car
&gt;  out.  She didn't notice anything funny happening and
&gt;  didn't notice what position the steering wheel was in.
&gt;  
&gt;  Is this a problem?  what should I check out?
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks

Hi Chrissie,

Please do not drive your bus until you have checked the steering 'system' 
out. I had a similar failure on my previous van which made the steering 
lethal and required replacement of the front axle!

Have an assistant turn the steering wheel, just enough to take up the slack, 
first one way then the other. While they are doing that look underneath and 
try to see where the slack in the steering wheel is being taken up. 

First have a look at the base of the steering column above the steering box 
at a rubber square that joins the column to the steering box and this may be 
torn. 

Work back through the linkages paying particular attention to the box at the 
centre of the lower part of the front axle. It has a pin going vertically 
through it and if rusted out will give a van very dangerous steering. The box 
and pin should be 100% stationary with the steering arms rotating around the 
top end of the pin.
If this has failed then you may be lucky and have sufficient good metal for a 
welded repair - if not then its time for a new front axle so I hope its not 
that.

If there is no free play in any of the steering rods but free play at the 
wheel with a good rubber connector then the steering box will need to be 
replaced - I hope it's not that either.

Anyway an under vehicle inspection while the steering wheel is turned 
(gently) will reveal the problem.

Good luck
