Posting this for my friend Pete, a former list member now in Huntsville.

For sale in Huntsville, AL By NOT ME:

1975 VW Westfalia Hardtop, White with Blue/Green Plaid interior, almost
perfect.  Still has original blue carpet.  A/C ducting is there, but
compressor not connected.  Almost perfect body (for a Humid South car) only
rust is in battery box and along rockers.  Good paint overall.  Runs great,
just completed trip from Chicago to AL this past summer with no problems.
VERY recent top end rebuild, completely replaced wiring harness,
meticulously cared for the past two years.  Selling it because he can't
stand to see it sit in his apt. complex lot unused.  Asking $2500.  Email
him, not me.                        email: Phannah_at_worldnet.att_dot_net
