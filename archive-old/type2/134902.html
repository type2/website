Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the regulator sticking at idle. Is it fully electronic?
&gt; I've only had one apart once, but I thought it was mechanical like a
&gt; bug regulator.

Hmm... don't know.

&gt; Trace the wire on the starter that you said looks like the charging
&gt; wire. Where does it go?

It runs inside a jacket that goes inside another slightly larger jacket that
leads through the tin into the alternator.

&gt; &gt;From our discussion last night, I thought we had pretty much
&gt; determined that your loose wire is the charging wire from the
&gt; alternator.

At least I think it is.  I'm halfway tempted to attach it to the battery to
see if it works.  I should have taken pictures of the engine compartment
when I dropped it off at the mechanic's.

&gt; In any case, you are obviously getting regulated charging voltage from
&gt; that wire, so if you attach it to the battery, you will get charging.

Is it possible that not having it hooked up allowed it get to 33 volts?  It
came back down as I rev'ed the engine.  I'm just a bit leary of sending that
much voltage to the battery.

&gt; You've been putting a charger on the battery regularly, so can we
&gt; assume your battery is good and will hold a charge once you get
&gt; charging current to it?

Brand new as of a couple of months ago.

Thanks, John.
