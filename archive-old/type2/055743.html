Subject: I hate men campout!

VanBondo **begs** to hold it around the Cascade Kombi/Vintage Weekend in
July as I too would love to go! I swear that I'm a lesbian trapped in a
man's body! Women are my sole preference!!!! I promise to show up in drag if
we can get the date arrainged. Kinda like Dame Edna rastafarian style...
Another woman would be traveling with me. I think that it would be great! My
&quot;S.O&quot; (that other woman) and I will be driving up from Phoenix for that
weekend. Pencil me in for the lettuce and clam salad.
