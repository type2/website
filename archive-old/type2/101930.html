[concerning &quot;polarizing&quot; brushes]

&gt; 	I KNOW George can probably explain the exact principles involved,

&gt; to seat...

I think that you have put your finger on it above.  Personally, I always
take it easy on new brushes until they are seated, but I suppose that the
&quot;rough&quot; approach has its merits.

Polarization has to do with creating a residual magnetic field in the
generator that will get things started  the next time the generator is
run.  Brushes, being made of carbon, cannot be polarized in any way.

I really like the alternator conversion.  More amps. lighter weight.  If
you aren't a &quot;concourse&quot; type it is worth the effort.  Only caution is to
avoid the &quot;kits&quot; and use original tin and alternator stands from a late
Beetle.  If you have a 38A generator you will also need the 30A or
alternator fan hub to replace the 38A bus fan hub for proper fan spacing.
