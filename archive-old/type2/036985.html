Subject: locking the engine hatch

Hi list members
I own a 73 kombi campervan of which I am very affectionate,I
cannot understand why it has locks on the doors, but has no
engine compartment lock.
This may seem a little paranoid but I can't help thinking that
leaving the engine exposed to would be sabatuers and the prospect
of being left stranded far from home is a little risky .

Does anyone have any idea's on how to adapt a lock for the engine
hatch door?

Thanks in advance
Mani
