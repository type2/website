Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia concept car

I have to wonder whether one of the reasons for the favorable responses 
to this design is the ground clearance. The concept is based on a 
lowered bus. That's one thing that I really don't like about it. It'll 
be pretty near useless for real camping.

I think that an ideal neo-bus will have 4wd, like the synchro and the 
prototype 4wd bays. Bye-bye low clearance.

The design team also seems to have a zest for symmetry, which generally 
turns me off except (a) where needed, and even then (b) in small doses. 
The inclined poptop in bay Westies (and the side-hinged Dormobile 
poptops) look better to me than this (and similar) solutions. But if 
you're into a Renaissance aesthetic, I guess this is the way to go.

(Getting practical again, high awnings provide less shelter from sun 
and rain than low awnings. Whoever came up with these awnings has 
either never been camping, or hasn't thought about it too clearly.)

Since engineering reality isn't a requirement for this exercise, why 
not build the concept kitchen around a microwave oven?

The body shape and the styling of the waist isn't bad. And I have to 
admit I uttered an &quot;oooh&quot; at the passenger seat/stairway.

Finally, (Scott, are you listening?) people who were not weaned on 
video games are never as impressed with CAD renderings as they are by 
airbrush work (even airbrush work in Illustrator). This CAD stuff looks 
cheesy.

Mark &quot;yes, but what do you REALLY think&quot; Hineline
