Subject: No gas to carb after engine install


I just replaced my cluctch on 79' Westy which PO deemed needed a Weber carb 
instead of FI. I've got the engine back in, and everything hooked back up. 
It turns over but that's it. I took the air cleaner off, and I'm not getting 
any fuel. I thought my inline fuel filter was clogged, but I took it out, 
and it has good gas flow. Does anyone have any ideas what could be wrong? 
I'm at a loss...which really aint saying much!

Thanks In advance for any and all advice.

One frustrated MOFO!!
Jared
