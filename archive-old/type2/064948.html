Subject: The People Have Spoken: [was: Ignit. relay, condenser short]

Greetings all:

Well, here at the Center for Promotion of Round Trip Driving, we've been
tallying votes all night, and we're projecting a winner in one race, but
the second is still too close to call: 

1. Would the condenser shorting against the distributor stop the engine
dead in its tracks? 

        100% of the respondents agreed that it would.  Some advised 
        replacing the condenser, and Ron Van Ness suggested a razor 
        blade--for the little boot at the bottom of the distributor!
        --and a screwdriver, though I'm not sure if he meant the tool 
        or the drink.  Have to go back and re-read his note.

2. If I tried to restart the engine while the condenser wire was shorting 
out, would that cause the ignition relay fuse to blow?

        This one is trickier: 50% said yes; 16% said no, and 34%
        abstained.  Obviously [did I say that?] the condenser wire
        wouldn't affect the relay while the engine's running, since
        the relay fuse would be out of the loop then.  But when I 
        hit the key...?

Well, anyway, it's clear I need to fix the short and that's an easy task, 
with or without the screwdriver.  Beyond that, I suppose I need to see if 
The Big Problem recurs. Thanks to all.

best,
