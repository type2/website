Subject: Re: [T2] Possible fuel injector problem??

[...]

1st try swapping the electrical connecters for #3 and #4 cylinders.
See if the miss stays at #4. If it does look for a vacuum leak or possibly a
bad injecter.
If the miss moves to #3, then you have a FI problem. I would look 1st at the
resister pack for an open circuit.
But since it is temp related, it sounds like a vacuum leak. Check the hose on
the runner tube.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Let me just try to state the facts simply:
&gt; 75 westy w/1800 FI T4 engine.
&gt; I have lately noticed that after the engine is warm
&gt; (after 15 minutes or so), it begins to run a bit
&gt; rough. At this point, I pulled each spark plug cable
&gt; and noticed no change in rpm when I pulled the cable
&gt; for cylinder #4.
&gt; Spark ok.
&gt; Compression ok.
&gt; I clearly have a fuel delivery issue, but only to
&gt; cylinder 4. When I pulled the cable for cylinder 4
&gt; when cold, the rpms drop a slight bit, but when the
&gt; engine is hot, there is absolutely no change. Does
&gt; anyone have any advice for my next moves? Perhaps a
&gt; faulty injector? As always, everyones advice is much
&gt; appreciated.
