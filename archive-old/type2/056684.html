Hi Volks!

Well.....it's just about time to head off on the great family vacation
-- for 2.5 weeks!!!!! We're leaving on Thursday morning from Northern
Virginia head to western Michigan (Grand Haven-Muskegon area) for some
camping/beach time.  Then we head east (via Canada) to NY state, Vermont
and home to Virginia.  So...if you see a nice, cream colored 69
campmobile with a genuine antenna wienie (courtesy of my sister in
SoCal) tooling on down the road, give us a wave.

Here is my two cents on the tire discussion.  I put four new Michelin MX
185 14's (the reinforced ones) on my 71 crew cab and the improvement in
handling over the passenger tires I had was incredible.

Bye!

Bob
