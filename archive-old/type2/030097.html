Another  water trap.  you cn get itty bitty ones that are not /to/ clumsy

Dont forget to drain your compressor /tank/ every few days of use during
the humid months, too.

(i drained near a gallon of water out of my 20someodgallon tank the first

head had a lot of blowby....yes, it was well used when i got it:)
