Subject: Re: Information from the list/ table hinge

Mick and List, 


&gt; By the way, my rear table composes 2 halves, joined by 2 flush mounted
&gt; hinges, the 2 halves opening out flat with a metal support bracket
sliding
&gt; out from one to support the other.
&gt; (The whole then fits on an upright which slides through a circular
support
&gt; screwed to one side and it then locates on a fitting on the floor).

I understood! I have the same! Mine is also a UK van so perhaps this a UK
specific?

&gt; I need one good hinge.

Me too! Anyone got another spare? Know a supplier


Darren
