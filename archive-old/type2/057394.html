For whatever reason, it sounds like your float needle is not seating snug
enough to cut off the fuel flow and the float bowl keeps filling, Could be
your floats are not set correctly or fuel pump pressure could be too high.
Electric fuel pump  should shut off when the float bowl is full. ( I hate this
part ) It may be a simple matter of taking the carb(s) apart and putting them
back together, and you can check the float setting while you are in there.
Sometimes just a sharp rap to the carb could seat things, if the adjustments
are right and it's just that every thing is new. One old hot rodder trick,
when all else failed, was to use the electric pump to get the gas up to the
front, and still use the mechanical pump as well. This way it served as a
pressure regulator and pump.  If you have a tester, see what the mechanical
specs were and see if the electric pump is close. It is usually a matter of
trial and error with the carbs, you should get it. You do have a fire
extinguisher handy, don't you? ( all this advice is fuel pump / carb generic.
I have put plenty of electric fuel pumps on plenty of cars with safe reliable
results. And a couple that just leaked every once in a while!) Good Luck!
