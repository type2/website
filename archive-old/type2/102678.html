Subject: Re: [T2] Head Gasket Question

&gt; I'm currently re-installing the heads on my 1977 T2 and I'm a bit confused
&gt; about the head gaskets.  I received new head gaskets from Bus Depot that
are
&gt; metal.  But, the heads already have metal shims.  Are these shims the
&gt; original head gaskets or do I add the new &quot;metal&quot; head gaskets to the old
&gt; shims?  (BTW, these are the original heads)

Those are the old gaskets.  Take them off. If you took the cylinders off
there is also a gasket that fits between the cylinder and the block, replace
those ones as well.

Hope that helps,

Mike
