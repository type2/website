Subject: Public apology to John Connolly

Volks -

I commented offhand in a previous posting that John hadn't responded to a
question I'd asked.  He correctly pointed out that I had not verified that he
actually received my question.  I made the incorrect assumption that he hadn't
replied simply because he was too busy or found my question unimportant.

I greatly appreciate aircooled_dot_net's contributions to keeping our Buses happy
and alive, and don't mean in any way to tarnish John's excellent reputation.

- Miles
