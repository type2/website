Hay!
     I like stopping at truck stops, There usually well lite, open all
night(nice for the bathroom), a lot of the new one's have showers for
the truckers(but if you ask they will let you take a shower), and I feel
safer than I would at a rest stop. The bad is it is a bit noisy, but
after driving all day you usually don't hear much.

Thanks for listening
