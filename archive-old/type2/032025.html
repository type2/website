Subject: Who wants a set of used 2.0l P&amp;C's????
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.991028165003.30912A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

As you may or may not know, I rebuilt a couple of 2.0l Vanagon engines 
during the last year.

After I did the first clean up of this set of P&amp;C's I said &quot;All right, I 
can reuse these!  Good looking cylinder bores, only cosmetic scuffing on 
the pistons, yippie!!&quot;  But after spending all the money I did on the 
rest of the engine (heads, align bore, bearings,  rods, cam, etc., etc.) 
I figured I'd be penny wise and pound foolish to reuse this set; I was 
well past the &quot;economical rebuild&quot; stage of the game.

Anyway, rather than throw them away I figure I'll offer them to the 
lists; maybe someone who's doing a &quot;bucks down&quot; rebuild can use them.

I was carefull to keep wrist pins/pistons/cylinders together so the 
established wear patterns won't be disrupted.  I did a pretty good 
clean up of everything before oiling the bores and putting everything in 
baggies, so they're pretty much ready to go.  You'll need a new set of 
rings ond one C-clip (or come find it in my garage.)

I'm asking $13.95 plus actual shipping costs from my zip (94549) to 
yours.  (Let's see... find a box, wrap them up, drive to the UPS station 
in Concord, have a burrito at the local stand.. Damn, no profit left!)

Caveat:The P&amp;C's look good to my semi-educated eye and I honestly 
believe there's lots of miles left in them, but I don't have the tools to 
mike them properly, so no guarantees.
