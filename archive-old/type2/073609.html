No, '71s were DP.  I have one.  The manifold is a 1-year-only part (in the
US) and has a 211 part number.

The dual port upright continued in non-us baywindows and vanagons for
quite a while.  I don't feel that they lack any low end over the single
port engines, but my experience with single ports is limited.
