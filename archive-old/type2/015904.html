For idle you don't need much oil pressure at all.  A couple of psi should
be sufficient.  I feel completely comfortable with 10 psi but if the idiot
light comes on (6-9 psi they say) as it will do sometimes when the oil is
hot I still don't worry.

For highway speeds the old hotrodders rule of thumb is 10 psi for every
1000 rpm you're turning.  This means around 35 psi for the typical bus
cruising speed.  I've seen as low as 25 on my engine under extreme
conditions and not had any problems.  I read somewhere that the main
bearings never see more than 28 psi because of the relief valves, but I'm
starting to wonder if that's really true. In any case I feel 30 is a good
safe number and if pressure drops below that I avoid straining the engine
until it goes back up. 

I can't remember what the Bentley says...   BTW, I've
&gt;got a FI type IV engine with a VDO oil pressure sender/guage and stock
&gt;idiot light.  

Fantastic!
