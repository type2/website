Subject: Exhaust mess

I ended up cancelling my trip North for the July and I think my bus got
mad at me. Yesterday, while it was warming up it rolled out of the
driveway and into a ditch. The bumper is now toast and the exhaust took a
hit in the tailpipe. I now have a split in the passenger-side heater box
where the box meets the flange that attaches to the exhaust manifold. I
put a picture up at http://www.bradway_dot_net/~eric/bus

The bus is a '74 with 1.8l but it has a '75 exhaust. My heater boxes are
in pretty bad shape to begin with and the heat isn't even connected. I'm
on a very tight budget but don't want to drive a noisy bus. Should I
patch, weld or replace the heater box? If I replace it, I may have to go
back to a '74 exhaust and the other heater box.

-Eric
