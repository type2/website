&gt; Hi everyone!!!
&gt; ok this whole thing with the vw trademark logo stuff is a bunch of you know
&gt; what but we as vintage enthusiasts need to show VW what we are all about!
&gt; they have no clue!! the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club is hosting a
&gt; petition to send to VW. You DO NOT need to be part of this club to sign the
&gt; petition! Hey I got a update by e-mail to say that they are actually getting
&gt; some positve feedback! I wish that everyone on this list would fill out the
&gt; query form on the website http://www.mvvc_dot_net
&gt; and lets get this whole thing resolved!!
