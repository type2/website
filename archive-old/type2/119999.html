Subject: was hella now bosch relays

&quot;&quot;&quot;The relays can be found at www.partsexpress_dot_com for
89 cents.
       Rik  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;                                     
               

  hhmmm Bow Wow sells em for around $7.00 but 
Partsexpress is a very good deal! However I would
say splurge and go with the $1.79 relay (Part Number:
330-077 ) as it is rated to 40 amps. Also they sell
the
relay socket for $1.75... makes for a nice clean
installation...  tnks Rik!
