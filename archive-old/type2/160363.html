Hi Chai,

With all due respect... driving on the ebrake alone is irresponsibly  
dangerous. You're risking yourself and the public doing so.

The eBrake is for EMERGENCIES. It's there as a backup system.Also  
remember that a perfect e-brake still only operates the rear brakes,  
which are only 30% of the total braking power.  If you're using the  
ebrake alone and it fails, your kids are gonna grow up without a father.

Take the day off work, rent a car, hitch a lift or ride a bike to  
work, or whatever, but don't drive the bus until the brakes are  
properly repaired. Whatever it costs is WAY less than the potential  
outcome of driving on the ebrake alone.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
