Subject: Broken Front Torsion bars

Hello List,

Today I finally found a bit of time to remove both front torsion bars from 
their tubes on my '78 Westy. After I took off the torsion arms on the 
drivers side I noticed that a previous owner or mechanic had welded a bead 
connecting the ends of the leaf springs. A few of the springs had broken 
free from the bead. Those same free springs didn't feel right and I 
suspected that they were broken deep inside. After I removed the center set 
screws I pulled the bars out the passenger side (no welded bead). Two of the 
upper bar springs are broken close to where the center set screw is and one 
spring in the lower bar is cracked. More damage might be revealed tomorrow 
when I clean them up a bit more.

My question is essentially what now? I haven't seen these for sale at any of 
the vendor sites. Will I be so fortunate and have to disassemble an entire 
front end on a junk yard bus in hopes that their torsion bars are not broken 
too? Or is there some other mechanical application in the world that uses a 
similar spring and I could just replace the broken springs. I thought about 
stealing the torsion bars from my '79 Westy, but I kind of need to drive it 
for a few more months until the '78 gets back from the paint shop and is 
ready for the drive train from the '79. Any ideas greatly appriciated. I 
looked in the archives but only found the same question w/o an answer.

Thanks,
Brandt
'78 Sagegreen Westfalia (Vegas Bus)
'79 Sagegreen Westfalia (Rusty Bus)
