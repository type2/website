Subject: oil breather with filler cap

When I bought my bus it took a while to figure out what the po had done to my
engine...the oil filler tube is gone and has been blocked off with a
fabricated plate. Nice. Anyway Mark Dearing thinks the hanger bar is installed
backwards, because it is blocking the area where the oil filler tube (and
dipstick booty) should be. The po did a lot of work if the hanger is installed
backwards, actually tack welding the hole in the tin where the filler tube
would be and piping in a tube for the dipstick booty and dipstick to go. I
plan to hash out all of this once the camping season is over, but for now....

In order to change or add oil I have to remove the little oil breather that
sits on top of the engine (the one with the wire bail) and it is a pain
because my carb return spring is attached to it (another po hassle). I noticed
at NaturalBus that a fellow busser had a 411 engine in his bus. His oil
breather has an oil filler cap on his oil breather. I guess that's the way
they all were and I am hoping somebody on this list has one cheap for
temporaty use I could buy. I don't know any resources for the 411 car and the
Samba only has a few parts up for sale.

Thanks in advance (I have PayPal)
