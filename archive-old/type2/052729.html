Subject: [T2] what I noticed last night

Just an FYI post. The same dash seems to be used for left and right hand
drive vehicles. I removed instruments and switches last night for a paint
and noticed that the instrument hole and glovebox hole  are both the same
size - and the glovebox lid mounting holes are there on both sides. I dont
want two gloveboxes, but a lid from one would make a nice basis for an
alternative instrument panel methinks.
