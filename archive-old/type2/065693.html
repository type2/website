Lets put it this way. You start out 6&quot; from the accident.
Lets contrast this with my Camry. I start out about 4' of caerfully designed
crush zones, an air bag, new impact absorbing mounted seatbelts, from the
accident.
Although Idrive a bus too, I don't try to talk myself into believing
it ahs ANY degree of crashworthyness, except it is high, heavy, and has a 
big frame, so if I hit a Miata, I'll use up HIS crumple zones, but hitting
anything with any wieght could be an issue so to speak.
