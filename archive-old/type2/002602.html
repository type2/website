&gt; The literal answer is maybe and maybe. Could be regulator and/or diodes
&gt; in the alturnator. Test diodes first, if good, replace regulator/brush
set.
&gt; If bad, get a Bosch Reman and have another 20 years life then look before
&gt; you zap in the future. Note also always disconnect the neg. terminal first
&gt; and reconnect the neg. term last before and after doing ANY electrical
&gt; device remove/replace, including the battery.
&gt;

I believe you are thinking of a Vanagon alternator. Bay alternators do not
have a internal regulator/brush set. Bay brushes are not easily replaceable,
neither is the alternator easily replaceable!
