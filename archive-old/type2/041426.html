Subject: carbs

Hi everyone i am new to this mail service but it looks like it will prove
worthwhile.  I have a question.  I have a 1974 sportsmobile bus and i have
88,000 original miles on it.  It isn't running perfectly and i am told the
reason is because i need new carbs.  I currently have the original dual
solex's.  I am looking to buy new carbs and was wondering if anybody knows
which will work the best.  Also i am wondering if i can rebiuld the
originals.  Thanks Jason  Indiana
