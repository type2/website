Subject: Case Study: Lube Failure

Saw this Bus one year ago. Compression then was nicely balanced at 
medium-high spec. Did a standard engine maintenance and lube. One year 
later and 7200 miles, all cylinders nicely balance BELOW minimum spec. 
Owner says they changed the oil once during that time without filter 
change. One year under rule of thumb compromise maintenance and trash one 
engine. Leak down showed rings not sealing. Scouring and/or warping due to 
lack of maintenance.

Use was something like 8 miles to town and back every day, with a coupla 
trips of a few hundred or thousand miles. $100 in oil and filters would 
have saved $3000 in repair cost. Oil and filters are dirt cheap compared to 
ANY dirt in the oil at ANY time.

When I bought my current Type 2 some 10 years ago, I had every expectation 
that a long block might be needed sooner or later. It was just a rational 
expectation from an unknown assembly. Since I use mine for daily short runs 
primarily, I change the oil and filter every 2 months or so, by inspection, 
before first indication of loading with carbon or moisture or gas. 60k 
miles later it still has good compression balance and runs clean. I have 
put perhaps $1000 in oil and filters on it in 10 years, about 1/3rd the 
cost of premature engine failure. Oil is cheap, use lots of it. In my case 
I'm running about 30 years between long block service replacement.
