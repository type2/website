&gt; At the risk of being a tad blunt, while there is merit in the caps/t
&gt; shirts/stickers etc ideas, if we ALL just donate $5/$10/$20, the funds
issue
&gt; won't be a problem. ( And for those who wish to question it, yes, I have,
&gt; check with Ted &amp; Thom if you wish. )
&gt;
&gt; I think it's fair to say that we all get benefit from the lists, and the
&gt; Type 2 &amp; Vintagebus sites, the guys running things are donating their time
&amp;
&gt; efforts (AND money) to keep things running, so ALL we're being asked to
help
&gt; with are the outgoing costs, communications costs, hardware costs etc,
&gt; bugger all against what we've saved in NOT getting VW unaware mechanics
etc
&gt; to butcher our busses.
&gt;
&gt; Once we get past the current problem, the occaisional donation ( using the
&gt; setup that Thom has, and i believe is being set up on type2_dot_com ) will
keep
&gt; the problem away. Come on guys, the admins shouldn't have to ask us for
&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, back under the bridge now.
