&lt;&lt; The thinner contact seems to bite into the slippery surface better and provides some traction, where the broad flat footprint does on snow and slush what that same footprint does on very wet roads.....it sort of hydroplanes. &gt;&gt;

Growing up in MN and later living in NY and MT before moving to OR has provided_numerous_weather related experiences that support this!!  

Though maybe not &quot;cool&quot; narrow is certainly the way to go for traction in the kind of wet/snowy/muddy conditions that my camper frequently seems to find its way into. : )
