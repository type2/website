I BELIEVE, as of, I think but am not real sure right now &lt;G&gt;, that the
new one adds an air temperature sensor to the unit and adds one more
pin to the wiring harness plug.


&gt; hi volks,
&gt; can anyone tell me the difference between the air flow meter on the
&gt; 76-77 fuel injected bus and the 78-79 bus. the part numbers are 280 200
&gt; 018 for the 76-77 bus but 280 200 020 for the later model. are they
&gt; interchangeable? they look the same on the outside to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 76 2.0l fi bus named clyde.

Mark
