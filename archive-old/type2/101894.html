Volks,

The BFG tires are HUGE! I mean physically large. I have a set of these exact
tires  which are going on a vw thing, but I am not sure about putting them
on a bus. They will fit I suppose, but they will really make your bus look a
bit like a mini monster truck. Maybe that's good! In fact the set I have
were sold to me by a fellow in my local club who refused to put them on his
bus because he felt they were just too big. They are roughly 1&quot; bigger on
the diameter than stock, which doesn't sound like much, but it is.

I would suggest the yokohama 370 LT is a good snow tire, and close to the
original size, but a quick look on tirerack_dot_com and this tire seems to be
NLA. I know we can still get them in canada.
