  In the winter, I run straight 30 and let it warm up well on the cold mornings.

Wha? Winter?  Well son you must have some kind of winter I ain't never heard of.
I took that sort of southerner advice back in the winter of '76.  
      It was in late November when I went out to start my trusty '65 Beetle (and
a sweet thing she was too).  We had a cold front come through that night and the
temp. was a balmy 10 degrees F

I say, when it gets that cold in the South San Francisco Bay area in the Santa
Cruz mountains, I usually don't consider using the bus for comfort reasons,
besides, I'd be crawling around under the house looking for the breaks in my
water lines.  Seriously, if it gets below freezing more than a couple days a
winter, we be hurtin' units.
