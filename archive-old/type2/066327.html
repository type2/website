In a strange and beautiful development, I have noticed that as I slowly
progress with repairing the various problems my sweet but ugly '71 has,
the &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers that I had supposed the previous owner had
placed on the rear window have been peeling off OF THEIR OWN ACCORD!
Could it be that the stickers had been generated by the bus itself - a
sort of symptom, like bedsores, of neglect? 

Within a couple of months, I hope to have her completely cured.
