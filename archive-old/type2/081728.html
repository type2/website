Subject: Re: [T2] converting tin for doghouse

Are you talking about the upper FRONT tin where the air scoop goes thru? On
what year bus? 71 is one-year-only [USA].
I do have an extra real one.....
Or if you were in a crafty mood, you could take a 68-70 bus piece, remove the
extension piece off the top and graft it to a bug front upper piece.


&gt;Just wondering if anyone has ever taken the rear tin for a non-doghouse style
shroud, and cut a hole in the back to accept the doghouse style shroud?  This
is the piece that seals the engine to the wall.  Would this work?
