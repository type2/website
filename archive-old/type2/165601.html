&quot;If the Up! is approved, Hallmark said he has told Volkswagen in Germany
the American subsidiary is &quot;highly interested&quot; in the car.&quot;

They had _better_ be interested.  VW is moribund in the US and they need

I'd like to see a utility version, but I have a feeling that a bus-sized
vehicle would demand a larger engine.
