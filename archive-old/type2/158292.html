&gt; From everything I've read that should be enough to at least see  
&gt; some action

&gt; be the
&gt; timing but from the little I know it appears to be at least close  
&gt; to timed
&gt; correctly statically.

Do you have a timing scale?

It sounds like you do but I just thought I'd ask.

If you don't have a timing light, you should consider getting one to  
do your own maintenance.

Sears has a good one for $49. Search on 00921027000.

&gt; I used the pencil in the #1 cylinder to find TDC, which
&gt; was almost exactly where the notch in the pulley is.  When I hand  
&gt; crank the
&gt; engine w/ the distributor cap off the rotor aligns with the  
&gt; distributor mark
&gt; exactly at 7.5 BTDC.  I've tried rotating the distributor a bit  
&gt; both ways
&gt; while the engine was turning over to no avail.

7.5 BTDC is right.

If the timing is too retarded the engine will never start.

Too advanced and the engine will 'ping' and you'll watch the fan kick  
backward just before it stops. Same ping can happen if the firing  
order is not right.

&gt; So, where do I look now?  I'm
&gt; not sure if this enough information for you guys to help but I have  
&gt; done a lot
&gt; of reading and cannot think of anything else to test.  Compression,  
&gt; fuel, and
&gt; spark at the right time, right?

Did you check for spark? How?

&gt; In my rookie opinion it has all this but will
&gt; not crank.  If anyone has any ideas of where I can look next please  
&gt; let me
&gt; know or else off to the professionals it goes.

Further things to confirm:

1) Power to the coil.

Turn on the key and check there is 12V at terminal 15. Terminal 1  
connects to ground (and there is also a white wire required for fuel  
injection).

2) Spark plug wires are in the right order.

1-4-3-2 is the order starting from the notch going clockwise.

3) Distributor is the right way around:

If this is backwards then you need to swap the spark plug wires  
around to compensate.

4) Fan notch is in the right position:
