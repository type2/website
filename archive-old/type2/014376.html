Subject: Homemade Trailer Hitch

With the talk of trailer hitches, and the need to take a mental break
from work, I did a google search on &quot;homemade trailer hitch&quot; and came up
with a page showing Dan Evans' hitch at:

http://sites_dot_netscape_dot_net/danevansusa/trailerhitch

Unfortunately, Dan hasn't gotten around to posting plans. Having just
acquired a $35 boat trailer, I'm strongly feeling the need to work with
metal and fire soon to fabricate a hitch. I have some of the
components already, so I should come away on the inexpensive side. Haven't
decided, but I think I'm going to try to fab a receiver hitch, as I like
the versatility it will offer.

BTW, the boat trailer will make it's trip home on top of my bus'
homemade roof rack (for which I have been meaning to put up plans for 
over a year).

Thanks! Joe
