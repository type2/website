Subject: Re: [T2] Westy inside sliding door handle

Broke mine Wednesday and replaced it with the handle on the rear mechanism
of the sliding door of my 77. However the the door latching mechanism will
not open from the inside, that's how I broke the handle in the first
place, trying to force it to disengage.
The slidiing , however still opens with the out side handle, STRANGE. Does
any one know if I need to buy whole new door mechanism, or If there is a way
to fix or adjust something on the old one?

&gt;&gt; HowEVah! And I just learned this: The handle on my 73 goes on a square
&gt;&gt; shank that is tapped in the center. The shank on my 69 (and, I just
&gt;&gt; learned, Mike's 71) is a different shape, to wit:

Apsey)
&gt;&gt; Steve calls it castellated. Did this change occur in 72 or 73?
&gt;
&gt;Ha Ha!
&gt;Remove the screw and remove the piece off the square shaft. What you have
is
&gt;what is left after the plastic handle breaks off!
