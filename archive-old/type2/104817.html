Subject: Re: [T2] VW Parts - JC Whitney???

&lt;&lt; I don't have one near me, else I'd do it...Anyone care to do a quick
 statistical study on the J.C. VW catalog and see how much is cos-
 metic vs. mechanical... ?

I just got a JC Whipme in the mail out of the blue this week. I'd have to say 
that it has mostlymechanical stuff and runs the gamut. There's body parts, 
rubber, interior, lots of engine stuff. Names such as engle, bugpack EMPI
(FWIW). There's even engine cases and cylinder heads (type 1 of course) Lots 
of  tools. Of course there's a couple pages of bitchin ultra kewl chrome tin 
and the like. There's even five or so pages dedicated the NU Beetle. I must 
admit to being intrigued by the 36.99 air/fuel ratio gauge.
Happy Friday All :-)
Mike
