I bought the plastic one the Bus Depot sells.  When I got it, I noticed
the numbers were molded black plastic on a black background.
(_Hitchhiker's Guide_ flashbacks here...)  I knew I'd never be able to see
that while trying to time the thing with a strobe, so I bought a silver
paint marker and carefully picked out the raised numbers and tic marks
with it.  Looks pretty darn good.  Don't know how well the silver paint
will hold up in the engine compartment, but if it ever fades it wouldn't
take me long to re-do it.

On a related topic, anyone know where the notch should be pointing at max.
advance on a pancake engine?  I've heard 30 degrees bandied about, but I
think that's for an upright; is the Type 4 any different?
