I tracked an oil leak to my oil filler pipe, and pulled it off to replace 
the gasket.  When I removed the lower nut, the stud came with it!  It 
appears that I damaged the threads on the lower stud when I pulled the 
engine, and when I replaced the oil filler pipe, I stripped the threads 
in the lower hole (the one in the case) because turning the nue, turned 
the stud.  I didn't feel a lot of resistance, so I'm surprised that the 
threads are stripped, but they clearly are.  Is there any good way to get 
something in there tight without having to remove the fan housing and 
installing a helicoil?
