Ok, here are some improvements to the Archived ball joint removal
instructions.

When you remove the sway bar, tap the retaining clip that is around the
rubber bushing from the back towards the front of the bus.  I used a 2 foot
long screwdriver for this, and they popped right off.

In removing the old ones, I used the torch, and a air chisel with a flat
attachment.  Be sure to do this outdoors, and that you remove all the rubber
from the old ball joint.  The grease in there can catch fire and lets off a
nasty stench.  This gets them out pretty quickly.

I had access to a 5k lb press, and it would not press in the new ones.  So,
I took the rubber boots off  my new ball joints, indexed the new ones to
line the notches on the joints with the boss on the torsion arm. (just did
one for example to the machine shop)  I believe vw's are one of the few cars
that the ball joint needs to go a certain way.  If you don't tell them, they
are NOT going to refer to the Bentley, and the Bentley states not to use
them if they have been pressed out .

The machine shop charged me $20 for this.  One more thing....clean
everything up before you go to the machine shop............that might be
part of the reason I got such  a fair price.
