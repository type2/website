'76 and later are great, to most of us in the industry.

&gt; &gt; quesiton, i recently acquired a 77 with stock 2.0 FI engine, i have been
&gt; &gt; told and seem to remember that the early FI's sucked.  I know i have
heard
&gt; &gt; this.  THis being the case, what was the problems they had, and what
&gt; &gt; should i look for on a engine that has been sitting for about 2yrs?
&gt;
&gt; I have had nothing but fuel injected VW's since my wife got her 74, 412
&gt; wagen...they work, they work very well.  right now I have a 78 FI with
&gt; auto tranny and it is by far the most powerful, smooth running, responsive
&gt; (with the correct Dizzy not the .009) bus I have ever had, and I've had a
&gt; bunch....what te fuel injection is, is that it is different!
&gt;
&gt; learn the differences, take your time and you will not be disappointed.

&gt; BTW, usually the Black box is the last thing to go wrong, it is almost
&gt; always something else.  leaky hoses is the #1 problem
