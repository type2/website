Subject: LATE BUS timing,lowering and jet size questions...
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I own a '75 bus which I have just brought back from the dead.  I installed a
'78 2 liter engine with a 009 distributor and a Weber progressive carb .  I
have just bought all the right tools to do a tune up myself but I have a few
questions.  First, I do not have a clue where to time it.  My mechanic timed
it last time but it runs with a slight hesitation of the line and kind of hot,
around 265 and the gas mileage sucks.  I get around 12mpg at highway speeds.
I would like to install a Crane cams XR 3000 coupled with their PS91 coil
would this help to get rid of the flat spot and help with mileage?  Does
anyone know a good jet size combination?  I tried to switch jets around to try
and get rid of the flat spot but it ran to rich.  Also does anyone know where
I can find a galvanized single quiet pack?  I saw it in a '96 EMPI catalog but
my dealer said that they don't make them anymore.  I read that Berg avis
adjusters can be installed without cutting the beam, can I use these on a bus
or are they just for bugs and do I have to remove the beam?  Ideally, does
anyone make dropped spindles for my year bus?  Thanks for any impute....
