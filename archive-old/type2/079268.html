&gt; And I know a gentleman, that has, for sale, as we speak, a type 2,
&gt; factory issue, from VW, to fit in the third hole to the right in the
&gt; dash, tachometer---I don't think it is going to be cheap, or even
&gt; resonable---
&gt; But they are out there-----

&gt; If anyone wants it--P-mail me, and I'll hook you up with him ( or It

&gt; If they even made stock tachometers for buses, it's news to me. I'd love
&gt; to have one that matches the stock equipment; right now I've got some
&gt; aftermarket device that doesn't quite fit in, so sticks awkwardly out of
&gt; the dash rather than being set in. Still, it works, so if you care more
&gt; about having a tach than knowing what time it is, you can always settle
&gt; for something that doesn't quite match, or fit, but does the job.=20
