Subject: Jalousie windows
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks:

I can't remember who mentioned this but I have a
tendancy to leave my jalousie windows open most of the
time in hot weather and I have a scar on my shoulder
to prove it.  What is it with those things?  Yeowtch! 
Or better yet, what force causes me to walk right next
to the bus when I know they're open?

I'm pretty sure it's not recommended to leave them
open when driving because you can see them oscillate
at speed.  That can't be good for the overall
integrity of the frames and such but you need the air
in summer!  Is the sliding screen window from a 79 or
newer the same size?  It might not be bad to have a
crank out on one side and a slider on the other.

One more thing.  If you've gotten tired of replacing
those cheezy plastic adjuster knobs from the jalousie
cranks you can use the low-profile universal casement
window cranks (t-shaped) from Home Depot or Lowe's or
whomever.  I paid &lt;$10 for a pair.  Works great and
has for two years!  You can also find those things in
a Skymall catalog (if you fly) but they're overpriced
in there...

Archivally yours,

Bob J.
