Subject: Re: [T2] roof rack for 78

volks

  I've decided to finally get the canoe up off the roof of my van and put
it on a real rack.  now of the brands and models avaliable what gets you
high enough to fit over the hump in the roof without sitting waaaaay above
the roof, I would like it to just barely clear the roof if I can, don't
need tooo much wind turbulence up there.

thanks
Bob
