Subject: Re: [T2] rapid response to low oil-P

&gt; How does this differ from Japanese/US models with similar sticker  
&gt; prices that have several engine options available to the buyer?  
&gt; You're suggesting that VW made undesirable models to begin with but  
&gt; wouldn't a choice of engines help sell an underpowered vehicle?  
&gt; That's why I think it's a mentality. VWoA may have said, &quot;we need a  
&gt; bigger engine&quot; and I bet VAG would have replied, &quot;why would you need  
&gt; that?&quot;. 

Honda was quite adament until the past decade that a 4-cylinders was 
enough. Then came along nice Honda V-6 engines. They were also against 
diesels but I hear they are planning a diesel or two for the US market 
in the near future (believe it when I see them).

VWOA should have told VW of Deutchland that they needed a HP/weight 
ratio or a target 0-60 time. When Germany asked &quot;why?&quot; then somebody at 
VWOA should have invited a few engineers over from Germany for a ride on 
American roads in popular American market vans. My watercooled VW cars 
have had plenty of umph but the vans have always been slow, slow 
compared to the competition. Have not driven a VR-6 powered Eurovan.

I owned a 40HP Italian-spec Beetle for 3 years and travelled all over 
Italy in it and it was slow compared to modern traffic but plenty fast 
against he vintage traffic and trucks.

Chris, still rambling...
