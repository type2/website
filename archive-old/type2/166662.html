Subject: RE: [T2] rust in scoops

Basically you would have to sandblast then paint them.
 A spraygun will work reasonably well, may have a few
runs, but the OEM paint jobs typically had runs in
there anyway.

The best way to do it would be with the engine and
fuel tank out...that way you could prep and paint
everything in there.  If the engine's in, tape off the
bottom and blast away.  Paint the inside first, then
prep the outside of the vents to get rid of any
external runs or paint smears...the outside of the
vents then get re-painted with the body and should
turn out just fine.

If the fuel lines rusted out (mine haven't) I guess I
would use compression (Hoke) fittings and steel tube
to fabricate new ones. It's pretty easy to bend the
tube, using the right tool. Or maybe you can buy them
prefabbed?
