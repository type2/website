Subject: spit seat option on westy
Message-ID: &lt;6ab8033d.24425269_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello,

I stumbled upon some old VW pamphlets and found out that there was a optional 
split-seat ( http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/sales/so42book18.jpg) 
that attached to the icebox side and could be raised up and down between the 
ice box and other seat.  Anybody know if these are still in existance or 
available anywhere?
