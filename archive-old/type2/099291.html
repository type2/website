&gt; &gt;Not quite as hands-free as running an isolator, but it works OK for me. I have an isolator, but haven't made time to install it as I'm not sure it would be safe with this kind of battery. Opinions?

&gt; No difference in the function of the isolater with that battery, so you're okay there.


Actually, what might appear to be a small difference with the isolator [in
comparison to a relay] is the key here,, the Isolator has a 0.7v drop across the
diodes, and with Greg's use of small awg wire,, the Gel cel will receive the
appropriate [lower] charge rate.
