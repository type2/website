Subject: Hella Taillight Housings

If you are like me you have been eagerly awaiting the availability of Hella taillight housings again for a 72-79 bus.  My are in such bad shape they distintigrate on touch and I have been disappointed by the quality of the aftermarket items. Bus Depot has Mexican Hellas in stock again and they are much better than the Brazillian or Taiwainese variety. 

See the pictures at the bottom of this page:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/78_Westy/PhotoAlbum37.html

What you get:

211 945 241 Lens (red/amber/white)
411 945 235 Lens to Housing sealing washer
211 945 231 Housing (grey)

What you don't get:

211 945 285 Protective cap
411 941 123 Housing to body gasket
211 945 179 Upper grommet
NLA                Lower grommet
N 012 225 3 spring washer + N 011 005 4 hex nut (mounting hardware)

The junkyards will have all these items.

The lenses you get are the same nice Mexican made Hellas you'll find on eBay for $30+ a pair.

The lens screws are the original variety with the long post and the threads at the bottom instead of short screws with threads all the way but they screw into the plastic housing instead of a metal insert like the German NOS variety. You do however get grommets for each screw to seal the lens further from the outside weather.

I tried a Hella and SWF protective cap and they both fit.

The Taiwanese variety, which is the 1st runner up, seems to be molded much better that the Brazillian ones with the black body and although some do include the protective cap the electrical contacts are slightly different. The stop lamp connector doesn't have the split male connector like the German or the Mexican Hella have so you have some minor rewiring ahead although they do fit the body correctly.

See wrong connector...

vs. Hella with right connector

The Hellas do cost more than any other aftermarket alternative but I think they are the next best thing to a German NOS part. Some of the molding patterns on the housing are identical to the original. I suppose if this one distinitgrates it will be truly authentic!
