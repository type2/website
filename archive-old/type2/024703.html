I looked into doing this...  cutting the top off and replacing with a junker
Westy top.
After I spent a few hours pulling parts off a burned westy and talking to
the body man, 
I decided it really was a hack job waiting to happen. Instead, trade your
bus for a 
beat-up Westy, then nickel and dime to fix it up. No big bills stuck in
committee there.
