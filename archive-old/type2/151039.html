Subject: Re: [T2] broke down (nuts!)

Timothy,

An electrical fuel pump *made* for carbs from a local supply would be the 
absolute easiest.

Back on the road almost magically....who cares if it is mounted so as to 
be a little noisy right now....you are back on the road and can remount it 
at your leisure.

As long as fuel is your problem....

Buy a good pump(not a &amp;quot;facet&amp;quot;) and make sure that they know that it is for 
a carbed vehicle needing somewhere around 3lbs of fuel pressure.

Wire it in to the distributor power line with a spade lug on the 
distributor and drive off into the sunset.

If I remember correctly, a new mechanical one installed means dropping
the engine....although it has been a long time since I did that on one of 
my early bays.

Look down one of the carbs carefully! and press the accelerator and see if 
you have gas squirting out of it.....no gas, no go.

Splice the fuel line from the tank to the line from the carbs and leave it 
a few minutes...gravity feed will try and push gas to the carbs...not 
enough to actually drive around the country on, but enough to start it for 
a few seconds.

Take a small capfull of gas and pour it down the carbs, then start it...if 
it starts and runs, then you'll know.

Please note all ordinary fire provisions in this case.


Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Well, friends, my trip out west has come to a screeching halt. 

started checking fuel lines, pulled hose nearest to fuel pump, dry as a bone. 
I'm 99% sure my fuel pump is out. '74 bus, 1700cc, dual carbs, mechanical pump.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; Had to be towed 50 miles to Fredonia, AZ, where I am awating parts. 
Haven't ordered them yet (thought I would just buy a new pump and install it).
 It's at a garage, so if I can get the pump overnighted from one of the 
usual suppliers, I should be in biz.
  
is that the engine was running strong and sounding good up until this point.
  
 I repeat: I feel this is a fuel issue, specifically the pump (mechanical). 
Any hints on ease of replacement, things to look out for or other theories as to the sudden loss of power? I'll be online sporadically (in a public library right now), but will check my mail tomorrow. Thanks!
