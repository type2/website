Jonathan,

If that nut was properly torqued then you probably have a rear bearing
problem.  Do check the torque again regularly for the next couple of
months as it will probably loosen up again.  DO KEEP A NEW COTTER PIN IN
THAT NUT!  I believe that those cotter pins have saved any number of lives
without anyone knowing their life was saved by it.

A properly torqued ear axle nut very rarely comes loose for no reason.
Now is the time to save for and read up on rear bearing replacement as you
probably face that task shortly.

                             OOK!
