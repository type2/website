Subject: MofocoRama (WI): Sept 13, 14, 15

MofocoRama is being held this weekend, Fri. 8am-9pm, Sat. 8am-9pm, Sun.
8am-5pm on the Mofoco grounds, 102 W. Capitol Dr, Milwaukee, WI.
Here's from the most recent catalogue:
&quot;Mofoco-rama: We're havin' a huge Open House Blowout Sale!! You've seen us
at shows with our semi-trucks, now here's the chance to see our warehouse,
manufacturing plant, machine shop, and service department. Plus there's the
used parts corral....&quot;

Free hamburgers, hot dogs, and soda on Sat. Their phone number: 1-800-553-8955.

I think we'll be there for a while Sat. early afternoon. We're the green
and white 78 bus with KLUKONE plates, with vanagon list stickers on front
and back windows.

I am not associated with Mofoco in any way except as a customer.

Also, for any of the Milwaukee listmembers, there's a garage on Holton just
south of Capitol that always has a lot of (rusting) VW hulks (types 1 and
2) laying around it. Does anyone know anything about it? Whenever we drive
past it (it's become a pilgrimage kind of thing for me, like going to a
cemetery to remember the dead), it's closed.
