Subject: Re: longblock needed

FYI, spoke to Chris a few minutes ago, he's hooking up with a mexican
longblock, hopes to have it installed today. He's heard from several
folks on the list, sounds like he'll be in good shape shortly. Look for
his post when he gets home. Thanks all!

PS Yep, when we take a long trip, we'll definitely have the names of
AIRS members along the way!
