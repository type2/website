Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

Matty Kirk Wrote:
&gt; hello,
&gt; 
&gt; im considering trying to swap out my 2.0 Type IV for
&gt; the 1.6 Diesel that is in my rabbit. i remember
&gt; reading an artical once about a guy who put a GTI
&gt; engine in a diesel vanagon with good results. i know
&gt; that a vanagon is already setup for water cooloing
&gt; however i have a variety of ideas of how to work that
&gt; out.
&gt; 
&gt; what i am wondering is...
&gt; 
&gt; what is HP of the 2.0 Type IV compared to the 1.6
&gt; Diesel? if anyone knows HP of both GREAT but all i'm
&gt; really looking for (from this list) is the HP figure
&gt; for the 2.0 Type IV.(searched archives for this to no
&gt; avail)
&gt; 
&gt; also, does anyone know of anyone who has done this
&gt; conversion or something similiar? perhaps a website or
&gt; email address would be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks very much. as always any answers, opinions or
&gt; insights will be GREATLY appreciated!!!! thanks
&gt; again!!!

VW of Mexico made watercooled bays with both gas and 
diesel engines.(I thing they still do, but the days are 
numbered) Perhaps parts vendors in Mexico cound supply 
some of the bits for this swap. How's your Spanish?:-)

OR: you could leave both of your current vehciles 
intact, sell them and go to mexico in search of a used 
diesel bus. More expensive, but a bit simpler.
