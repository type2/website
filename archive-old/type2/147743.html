Subject: Re: [T2] valves

Karl's method of valve adjustment makes a lot of sense.
The use of a remote starter is a nice touch, too. But a second-best way 
of rotating the engine without having to get up is to jack up the side 
of the car you're working on (and *only* that side), put the bus/bug in 
4th gear and just turn the wheel. (Obviously, be sure to block the 
other wheel to keep the bus from rolling; use a jack stand, etc.)
