&gt;&gt; 3.  The propane tank may have a leak or need to be tightened in
&gt;&gt; one spot, b/c when i turn the gas on, white fumes leak (hiss) out
&gt;&gt; of the pipe running from the tank-- should I be able to show this
&gt;&gt; by anyone at a propane shop?
&gt;
&gt;I had to replace some parts in the propone system when I bought my bus
&gt;(1988), and I got the parts at an RV supply place IIRC.  I have heard that
&gt;standards may be changing and the Westfalia system may no longer be up to
&gt;code - anyone know about this?

As I understand it although these tanks are not equipped with auto off
fill valves, because they are vehicle mounted they will NOT have to be
replaced.  However any LP place can always choose not to fill your
tank if rusty/leaking/deemed unsafe.  The big problem with Westy tanks
is that places that weigh LP and don't have a flow gage don't like to fill
them because they don't know how much to charge you (how much it
holds.)  And a lot of idiots at the places don't get the concept of the 80
percent fill tap even if they are willing to fill (you fill till you see white
liquid LP out the tap.)  Anyway a leak is likely just to need dissasebly,
cleaning, reassembly, replacement of the copper pipe if needed, a good
hardware place and cheapo flare tool give satisfactory results, all pipe
fittings
should use a good gas approved compound (NOT on the flare fittings BTW)
from Lowes, Home Despot, whoever.  The great difficulty on Vanagon tanks
is that the rectangular Marshall Brass 2 stage regulators tend to go and
start blowing off LP, the '82s just went, amazingly it lasted 18 years, 7-8
is more common.  The rectangular design didn't work and is NLA but a
circular 2 stage Marshall reg from anybody online ($15-$20) or local
works fine and fits OK on the vanagon.  The bus used a circular reg to
begin with.  Leaks can also be from fill valves or shut off valves, those
are available locally mostly for not so much money, and repack kits are
available for many, though the '82 used a larger than normal stem kit and
parts weren't available.  Lots of places got shut offs by the ton they'll give
you free, same as the ones off of the old grille tanks which are illegal so
the valves are worthless scrap.  You should check ALL connections on
any LP system new to you with soapy water (a teaspoon of dishwashing
liquid in a 1/2 cup of water or so) brushed on or with a spray bottle.
Ideally even the connections inside even though those are low pressure
past the regulator.
