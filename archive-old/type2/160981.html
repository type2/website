Subject: Re: [T2] PDX 2.0L FI Rebuild Question

Sounds like Seqor Wayne's camper; he brain-picked me last week about
his recent bad-scary compression check news.

I don't think he really needs a full-on rebuilt, just heads.  There's no
clouds of smoke, no bad noises from the bottom end, and it seems to
run fairly well considering.   I offered to give a hand with the engine
R&amp;R and teardown &amp; evaluation, but it'd have to be done at his place
as my garage is full of crap .. including a couple pairs of junk heads.
