&gt;    About the dwell/timing changing, that sounds like the bushings may be worn out in your distributor. Remove your cap and rotor, and see if you can push your distributor shaft side to side. With the points rubbing block on one of the cam lobes (high point) you may be able to see it change the setting.
&gt;    If it does, replace the distributor, unless you have a Brother-in-law that works at a machine shop that can make up some bushings and install them.

I checked the distributor and it's fine.  I'm lubricated it properly now and there is Bosch grease between the cam and the rubbing block.  The dwell changes but it is within the Bentley spec.

What I'm saying is that sometimes the spark seems to fire a little later and the timing mark moves a few of degrees. The idle isn't rough, it just isn't 100% rock steady at idle 7.5 BTDC.  Before I replaced the points and rotor it wasn't consistent at all: the points, has a huge pit and a matching tit where they had melted, and the rotor (rev limiting 04016) had big holes in the metal contact at the edge.
