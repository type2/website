&gt; I've tried a few FLAPS and tire stores in SF, nobody seems to have this size.

&gt; I've leaving for Tahoe tomorrow and would like to pick some chains up
&gt; along the way.  Does anyone have a suggestion of where to buy them?

You might find a better selection at Tahoe, if the weather is nice enough
to get there!

&gt; Also, is LT195/75R14 the correct rear tire size for a 72?  If not, what is?

No.  The correct size is 185R14, load range C or D.  The ones you have
will work as long as they are load range D.  Load range C isn't enough in
your size.  The diameter is a bit smaller on the 195/75R14  Wear your
present tires out and switch to the original size!
