I use the vitron seals yes,
I clean the bores but do not oil them.
I then drive the tubes in tight by using an old tube reversed on top of
the new tube and hitting it with a rubber mallet.  little harder to get
out but they are in tight.  personal opinion, I have seen too many leaky
tubes that aren't all the way in so I make sure any I mess with are IN!

YMMV
