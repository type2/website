Subject: Question about Eastwood company products

Aloha List,
    I was looking through the Eastwood Company catalog today and came
across Gator Guard II Epoxy Bed Liner.  I was thinking that a bed liner
product of some sort would be much better then using roofing tar for
coating the interior to seal and protect  it.  Or should I buy the
rubberized undercoating product 7 dollars a quart as opposed to over 40
dollars.  Has anyone ever used these or have any suggestions.  Any and
all appreciated.


Mahalo,
Greg
