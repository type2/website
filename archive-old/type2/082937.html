Hi guys,

I've been on the list for over a year now &amp; I've looked at a lot of different mails on all sorts of different tuning problems &amp; preferences.

Last week before yet ANOTHER trip back to Sydney(300km - 188miles) I took my bus to a local mechanic who was admittedly not a VW specialist, just to try him out, because it'd been over 10,000kms since the last tune &amp; because she'd begun to idle rough.

I got the bus back with new points, plugs &amp; a general clean up &amp; she was more underpowered &amp; sluggish than ever, struggling to reach 100kmh(60mph) when I'd been holding her off 120kmh(75mph) before.

It isn't that she can't reach 120 now, it's just that it takes for ever even on the flat, &amp; I'm running a 2.0l that had a few tweaks when it was rebuilt for a few more horses so I understandably annoyed.

I've got a twin carb engine with a 009(&amp; please let's not go there for the moment).

How hard is it to learn how to tune one of these &amp; what do I need?

I'm tired of forking out $100 at a time to correct things that often the mechanic doesn't notice.

Is it really that hard?

Plus, I'd like to be able to do as much of the work on my 67 Panel that's my next project so I really think it's time I stopped talking &amp; started doing.

:-)

Cheers

Andrew Wood
