Subject: Buses Near The Bay-Trip Report

Good Morning All,
   Went to Buses Near the Bay this weekend, a LIMBO event at Point Lookout, Maryland. First I'd like to say thanks to Glen Smith for all his efforts in organizing this event, it turned out to be a great weekend. This was a milestone event for me, as its the first time I was able to convince my wife and 5 yr old daughter to come along with me (wife needed convincing, not daughter) I've been telling them how great VW people are, now they got to see first hand I was right. I've never had my Westy with its suspect 1.8 carbed engine so loaded down, with 2 1/2 bicycles strapped to the roof, 2 coolers, lawn chairs, toys,etc, I could feel a big difference as we pulled away from the house Friday about noon. We made it there no problem, got a great site right on the water. Saturday some opted for the boat trip to Smith Island, while we went up to Charlotte Hall to a huge flea market. Lots of &quot;Designer&quot; clothing and 100 piece socket sets for $9.95. I bought my daughter a toy &quot;New Beetle&quot;!
 for $6.00. Saturday night was a group dinner at a restaurant nearby, and that was excellent. Good food, nice people. Sunday morning was breakfast with friends and packing up to head home( how did I get all this stuff in here Friday?) Tried a different route home, heading over the 301 bridge from Md into Va., as I was paying the toll for the bridge, I looked ahead at the steep ascent to the bridge and thought &quot;God, she's never gonne make it up that hill&quot; Headed for it and prayed. Had to laugh at sign on bridge, &quot;Minimum speed 40 MPH&quot; as my speedometer needle barely touched 40. Got home about 6 pm, temps had dropped throughout the day, and it was cold. Unload and take a hot shower, then on to the weekend classifieds. A 1990 Vanagon Westy, 97K, silver. Called the seller, has an offer, but not firm, going to call me back today. HMMM, more power, and heat! Said he's never had cylinder head trouble, been maintained by VW since new, camped in it once, and always garaged. 10K firm. A!
nybody interested in a '76, I'll throw in the mig welder and the sheetmetal replacement panels? It was great seeing everyone again, meeting some new folks. As for the wife, see's not fully convinced (did'nt sleep too well), but says she's willing to try it again. I hope so, otherwise I'm gonna miss her! Daughter wanted to sleep in the camper again last night in the driveway! Hope everyone made it home safely, and hope to see you again soon.  Take care, Jeff
