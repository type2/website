&gt;Got any contact info for Performance Products?  Sounds like just what I

Gee, I would just do a search at dogpile_dot_com.

Moving the torque peak up the rpm scale is an essential part of my plan to 
get to 80 reliable, driveable, economical rear-wheel horsepower.

Carbs alone will never get you to 80 hp with a T-IV. You will need a 
balanced increase in cc's, valve sizes, cam lift, manifold and port 
massaging and balanced exhaust flow as well, to get to a 33% increase in 
hp. Overcarbing a stock motor will likely reduce hp.
