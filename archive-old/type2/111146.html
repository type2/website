Subject: Pieburg electric fuel pumps???

Hello List,

Does anyone have any information on the &quot;Pieburg&quot;
brand electric fuel pumps that are suppose to be a
direct replacement for the late model Bus Bosch F.I.
fuel pumps? I saw a picture of one and the body of it
is made out of hard black plastic and the inlet and
outlet ports are plastic. Is this a good quality pump?
Should I just stick with the Bosch fuel pump? I really
like Bosch products but I don't want to buy an item
just for the name printed on it.

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
David Kelly
