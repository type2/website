Subject: binding front brakes

Hi all,

	The brake pads (both front wheels) on my '71 bus are binding with
my foot off the pedal.  With the front of the car jacked up I can just
barely spin a wheel by hand (please, no jokes about needing to work out).
I don't think that the problem is the adjusting rod because the binding is
still there even after I disconnected the rod from the brake pedal.  Anyone
have a suggestion?

As always, thanks for any help,
Adam Rechs
