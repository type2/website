Subject: sorry about that

hey i just wanted to say sorry, since it was my post that started
the &quot;towing&quot; threads that we have seen recently.

i did not have a part in the subsequent cockfight, but i guess
i was the one who opened pandora's box.

i just wanted to eliminate any confusion since my name/comments
where posted a few times.
