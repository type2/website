Subject: More electrical problems...

Yes, following on from my lighting saga (and all those other sagas
Bob!), I've now got the most serious problem with my freshly restored
'68 yet!

OK, so here's the deal;

- - Sometimes when I'm driving along, the red light comes on very dimly,
seems to stay on for a while then go off.

- - from time to time the thing won't start, and I jump it and take it for
a long ol' hike to re-charge.

- - Saturday, I took off the earth strap and cleaned the connections -
tried to get the positive off too, but to no avail - locked solid; Q -
any tips for undoinfg this, apart from those in Muir - it seems the bolt
won't move AT ALL!

- - Until yesterday, none of this was a problem, but yesterday, the light
came on with a vengance - very brightly, the lights on the dash dimmed,
the stereo went off...I panicked!  I decided to turn round and go home
at the next round about - the round about was fairly tight, and I tookit
quite quickly.  As I did so, the light went off, and everything seemed
normal.

- - I arrived at my destination, and left the bus for 10 mins.  Came back
and it wouldn't start.  On turning the ignition, got a grunt or two,
then nothing.  The battery seemed fine though, as the lights were bright
as hell.

This means that the bus is just about unuseable as it stands - if I do
go somewhere, chances are I won't get back!

Any ideas about the cause of this - the fan belt seems OK, but I
wouldn't know if it had too much play - has about 1cm at present - *is*
this OK?

Your halp is appreciated, as always...

Thanks,

Jonathan.
