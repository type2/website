Subject: Charcoal Filter Canister cleaning or replacement?

The canister was designed to stop working after a certain amount of time.
This means it's no longer cleaning, but it isn't causing any harm either.
In general it seems most people have simply neglected this maintenance and
have received no problems because of it.

There was talk a few times on the list of people trying to crack them open
and change the charcoal, but I do not recall any positive results from this
experiment.  In general I think you've got to spring the bucks for this
piece or simply drive with the old filters.

Hope this helps.

- Shawn.
