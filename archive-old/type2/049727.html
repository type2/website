Subject: [T2] Rolling backwards on hills

One of the things I do on hills is to allow my bus to roll backwards 
purposely, to warn the &quot;so called driver&quot; behind me of my need for space.
I also use my emergency flashers if necessary while doing so. You will become 
proficient at finding the grab point for clutch and throttle though, as you 
use it more often. Ice and snow here in Colorado Springs,
I LOVE MY BUS!!!!!
