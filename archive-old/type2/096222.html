&gt; Is this a 20 footer, or a 60 foot paint job?

it means does it look good at 20ft or 20mph  or does it look good at 60ft
or 60mph

&gt; For all the work that you did to get the bus a uniform color you should

when I did mine I used automotive custom rattle can colors....makes it
easy to touch up too, I live in a hazardous enviorenment (the city)
