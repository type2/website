&gt; I'm sure that this has been discussed before; but it seems worth
another

&gt; 
&gt; STORY:
&gt; Earlier this week, I was called upon to help a friend who's '71
standard
&gt; beetle wasn't running well, and finally couldn't start.  Lifting the
&gt; hatch immediatly displayed the problem: the plug on the rear (rear is
&gt; rear) of the 'universal' replacement carb (30/31 PICT, Brosol, Brazil)
&gt; had defeated the three flimsy peans used to hold it in place and had
&gt; popped out and disappeared.  So I carefully ground down a dime a mm or
&gt; two all around and peaned it in place.  Yesterday, I had just picked
up
&gt; a passenger at the airport and was starting up my '71 bus when I got a
&gt; funny little backfire and terrible idle.  Lifting the hatch, what
did I
&gt; see but the same problem.  This time, the plug was to be found off to
&gt; the right side of the engine compartment, and I was able to pean it
back
&gt; in place with a tire iron and a hiking book (courtesy of my amused
&gt; passenger).
&gt; 
&gt; MORAL:
&gt; If you have one of these carbs, pean that plug better, ASAP.

The common repair for this is to clean the plug (which is usually
found somewhere in the tin) and the carb very well with spray carb
cleaner and paper towels and then to use fuel proof epoxy to hold the
plug in place. I usually do this the first time the carb is off the
engine so that I can place the plug horizontal so that the epoxy stays
put better.
