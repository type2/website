    My 16 year son was in the enviable position of having some money to buy
a car in which to learn to drive.  I thought of something like a small
Japanese automatic.   But  my son said he would really like to get an old VW
bus.  He doesn't often have strong desires and I like to support him when he
does, also it shows he is developing good taste.  So together we found a 71
bus in great shape.


    I also figured that by learning to drive a manual transmission bus he
would really learn to drive.   It's not like Autotopia at Disneyland.  And
imagine how well he will have to control his vehicle to pass his driving
test.  Picture the examiner's apprehension  when he gets into a  thirty year
old bus with a teenager.  He will certainly have to overcome the examiner's
suspicion.  In California he will not be allowed to drive other teenagers or
children for 6 months after he gets his license.


So listees,  I bet some of you have advice about learning to drive a bus.  I
hope you  will not all call me a fool; the deed is already done.  But I
would appreciate advice about teaching him to drive his bus.  So far he is
still getting comfortable starting and stopping in first gear on flat, wide,
quiet streets.  But I will have to let him go into second sometime.

Appreciate your help,

Lloyd
