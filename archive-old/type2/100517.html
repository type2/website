Subject: accessory vespa for bus

Hello all,

I was really surprised to see this post because I was thinking of the exact 
same thing: getting ahold of a vespa to tow or attach to the bus like 
Winnebegos haul SUV's.  I would not even consider buying a new Vespa: old 
vespa to new vespa=bay/split window to eurovan.  Except the eurovan would 
only go 40mph.  It's that simple.  Vespas are what got me into VW busses in 
the first place; a love of old world style, something that looks a little 
different and having a close rapport with the engine that got you there.  My 
'73 Westfalia campmobile belonged to my grandmother.  It was given to me to 
prevent me from buying a 500cc Honda (she was a nurse and I was a clumsy 
rider...)

So far in my shopping I have found: $1000 for a used Vespa in whatever 
condition.  $1500 for something that runs, but unrestored.  $3000+ for fully 
restored.  There are also places in Europe that ship used Vespas to the US.  
Prices are generally cheaper but you have to pay for shipping and lots of 
fun at the DMV, I'm sure.

Anyone comfortable working on VW busses should be able to handle restoring a 
Vespa on a coffee table.  And there are P&amp;C kits to make them go faster with 
a minimum of hassle.  I was thinking of bringing a Vespa along on VW road 
trips to do short Vespa side trips.  So much motoring pleasure should 
probably be illegal.

-James
