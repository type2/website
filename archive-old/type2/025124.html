Subject: Wanted: One Bus 
Date: Mon, 18 Jun 2001 13:18:34 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Would like to purchase my first bus. Prefer one that is running and not in
to bad of shape. Would like a Westy but that is not an absolute. Any year up
to 1980. Willing to travel. I have $1000.00 to spend OR I have a 1990 Honda
Civic LX to trade for a restored or partially restored bus. My car is worth
$3200.00.

Also, I am looking at a '69 Westy for $700.00 in Utah and have heard that
there are some bus crooks out that way. Can anybody elaborate or verify
that?

Thank You,
