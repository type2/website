Subject: Air Meter
Mime-Version: 1.0

Check your shop manual - ala Bentley or Muir and get out your Bosch F/I
book and test it. Then you'll know. No one should own a VW without
understanding it. There are too many crooks out there. 

If you don't have a book, buy one - it is worth $413 to you. Most of these
air meters can be r &amp; r 'ed by similpy diassembling it, cleaning the
contacts and bending the wiper arm to rub on a different part of the coils. 

You can take it off with a 10mm socket, and a screwdriver.

Write me if you need more help. 


&gt;I've got a '77 Bus Type2 2.0 FI, yadda yadda yadda, and it's been running
&gt;really bad.  The mechanic I just took it to told me the Air Flow meter
&gt;needed replacing.  He quoted me $413 for a new Bosch unit.
