So I had my 71 bus in to the mechanic today to do a transmission service and 
an alignment.  I have a brand new (15-20 miles)1600 upright with hydraulic 
lifters.   I didn't plan on him doing any engine work but when I got there 
he said he had heard a tap-tapping in the valves and decided to take a look. 
  What he thinks is that the intake lifter on my #2 cylinder is collapsed.  
He said it felt very spongy and  the only way to fix it is to crack open the 
case and replace the lifter!!  Aye-Caramba!!

First off I have heard many stories from this group repeatedly saying that 
is relatively easy to remove the lifter once you get the pushrod tube out of 
the way.  Is this only the case on the pancakes??   I drove it on the 
highway, per his suggestion, and then when I got home I could barely hear 
the noise.  Could I have fixed the problem??  Then tonight I went out to 
check it out, the intake on 2 was solid, I couldn't get it to move, (with 
the engine at TDC of course).  Then I ran it for a few minutes.  I could 
still hear a faint ticking on the right side,  at about 1500 rpms it gets a 
bit louder then beyond that you can't hear it anymore.  What is going on 
here???  Might the lifter be collapsed even though I can't get the pushrod 
to move??  If necessary how much trouble would it be to replace the lifter?? 
   I have heard there is a way you can adjust out a collapsed lifter, is 
this true and if so how hard is it??    And finally,  How far can I drive 
with the above mentioned problem?  (Sould I stop driving now or can I get 
1000 miles?)

Any and all comments are welcome
Thanks in advance,

P.S. -  Much thanks to anyone who helped with my brake problem
