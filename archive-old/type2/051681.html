Subject: [T2] Rebuilt Half Axles/ Autozone $99

Lately I've been checking regularly with my local Autozone.  In 
checking prices on obtaining various parts for my new 83 Vanagon 
project I came upon the following:

Late Bus thru Vanagon half shafts (axles) rebuilt......$99  ($25 core)

I've used these before on my A2's and find they have worked well + 
they have a lifetime warrantee..  New boots, rebuilt CVs on shafts 
ready to install with grease.  Their warrantee is generous.  I've 
replaced three sets of brake pads on my 89 Bronco II (400,000 miles) 
on this warrantee.
