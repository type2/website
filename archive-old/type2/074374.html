How do you adapt from the cap on the resevoir to an air hose?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the 50 cent (&quot;...remember when gas stations had free air, 
etc.&quot;) air
&gt; pump. You could also rig a generic pump into the bottle. I 
understand the
&gt; cheapness of using the spare on a Bug as the source of pressure, but 
I
&gt; could also see a long dusty/muddy road and a flat spare at its end...

2 reasons this won't happen:

1. you'll run out of fluid before much of the tire pressure is used up.
2. The in the line supposedly cut off when pressure dropped to 20PSI 
or so.

Still, all new production bugs have electric pumps, so I guess it 
wasn't such a good idea!
