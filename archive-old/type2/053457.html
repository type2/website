Subject: How to remove door lock cylinder?

Bussers,
I am trying to determine the lock cylinder code on the '70.  As part of the
process of the never ending body/paint job in my garage, I have the front
door handles off.  I have the exploded diagram from Haynes, but can't be
sure how to release the cylinder, if indeed the code is available on it.  An
alternate question, assuming the latches are all the same key code, (you
know what happens when we assume), what is the easiest way to get a key code
to at least have a key to try.  I'd hate to have to hire a locksmith.  TIA
