Subject: Storing parts

I've got a 78 bus, and a 77 parts bus.  My wife wants me to strip
the parts bus and get rid of the carcass (car-case?).  So
what's the best way to store parts so that they're still usable
later?

For instance, drain the fuel pump, or try to store it with gas
or something else inside it?

Clean the CVs and put them away in clean cloth, oil them first,
or store them packed up with grease?

Anything special about the wiper motor--will anything inside it
rust, or is there some good way to store it?

Any storage suggestions for *any* bus parts welcome, including tranny
and engine (though I'm sure they've been covered before).  But I'm
more interested in little parts, like door locks, electrical switches,
ECU, etc.
