Subject: Hold the Mayo ...

Great news!!  '78 Westy running fine...

I had such a problem with noisy lifters a few weeks ago, that I was
considering pulling the lifters out and cleaning them.  Read the manuals
and was ready for a lot of anxiety.

Before I did that, I decided to try some 'valve lifter cleaner upper'.

I bought some GUNK ValveMedic Valve Treatment for $1.29 (yellow plastic
container), and followed directions   

1)  Get engine to operating temperature (I drove it for 15 minutes
around the area)

2)  Put bottle of GUNK into oil.  Drive 5 minutes.  If noise persists,
see your mechanic.  (I put GUNK in, drove another 15 minutes.  No change
to the noise  :-(

Next morning, 18 hours later, I broke the news to the wife.  She would
have to follow me to the mechanic in her car, while I took the '78
Westy.

Started Westy, still a lot of noise.  Drove down the parkway at 50 mph,
and WOW!!  the noise quieted down to nothing after just 4 miles!!  I
guess the over night soak was what was needed.  We drove back home, and
called the mechanic and said, 'next time, baby'.

Over the next fifty miles, the Westy got super smooth.  The best it ever
sounded in last three years.

Bottom line:  I HIGHLY recommend the GUNK ValveMedic.  It does the job.

Last night, after fifty miles (two weeks) of running with GUNK in the
engine, I changed the oil.  And here was the extra surprise, no more
mayonaise!!

My mayo was gone from my filler cap and from my filler funnel.  They
were clean and dry.  Now this is an unexpected thank you for GUNK.  I
hope my CASTROL 20/50 stays clean!!

(Technical stuff follows)  GUNK contains (CAS#) aliphatic petroleum
distillate (68476-34-6) and naphtenic petrolium oil mixture
(64742-53-6/64742-52-5)  [[what ever that means]]
