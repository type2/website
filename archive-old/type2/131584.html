Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;Cripes, I didn't even mention the dash. That's why I wrote this post in the 
&gt;first place. I keep thinking about modernizing the ergonomics of driving. 
&gt;But how to do it without rendering the bus undriveable until done? Answer: 
&gt;go to a junkyard, hack out the front of a bus (one with rust holes under 
&gt;the windshield, so that I am not hacking a useable front), bring it home, 
&gt;mock up the rest of the cab out of plywood, then have at it.


In the meantime you can store it in the living room and watch TV through it 
and pretend to be at a Drive-In.
