Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

Owner's Supplemental Manual on my 84 Westy says to either Hand Wash or Dry
Clean them.  Had a customer awhile back call me for a new set of curtains
because she threw hers in the washing machine and they didn't turn out so
well.  Had to spend $169 for another set of curtains from me.

I recently had my curtains dry-cleaned to avoid this mess.  Now they're all
nice and fresh.
