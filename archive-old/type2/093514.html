Subject: VW shop closing update :(

--=====================_3828775==.ALT

To those who expressed interest in some of the stuff I mentioned last week 
about a VW shop closing here in Tallahassee,...I was too late.  I took the 
day off last wednesday and went out there and almost everything was 
gone.  There were 2 type IV engines he had saved for me (I didn't take 
them, they were both locked up).  The 72 Westy body was gone and the 78 bus 
had been stripped.  The sliding windows were gone as well as the sliding 
door.  I assume since only parts of the 78 were missing, all this stuff had 
been bought by someone else and not gone to the crusher.  I'm sorry that 
I'm not able to get stuff for folks who expressed an interest but I'm 
confident that this stuff was salvaged and not crushed.  I assure you, you 
won't see this stuff for sale by me (and probably not anyone else) because 
I wasn't able to get anything.  Hopefully, some of the other VW shops in 
Tallahassee got it all.  ...just thought I'd let everyone know.  sorry....greg
