Subject: gas

&gt; I hear gasoline is slated to get up near the $2.00/gallon mark this
summer!

You lucky basterds. Over here gas is about $4.00 / gallon right now !  And
my busses consume just as much as yours. This just goes to show that even if
prices double people will still use their cars. They'll rather economise on
other things than leave the car at home.
