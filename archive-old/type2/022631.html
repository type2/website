&gt; In a properly adjusted bus, you cannot see the horizon in the inside

&gt;  faster tire wear, and CV joint/boot failure.
&gt;  
&gt;  An unloaded bus normally points up a bit in front.  Put a 170 pound
&gt;  driver and passenger in the bus and it should be level, measured on
&gt;  the sliding door sill.  The reason for this is that VW assumed that
&gt;  the front seats would be filled first, and their load is carried
&gt;  entirely by the front axle.

Here's what I did.  I asked my mechanic to adjust the rear bars to the stock 
height.  Unfortunately, he adjusted it a little bit higher, about 3/4&quot; higher 
as measured at the left rear fender well and 1/2&quot; higher on the right side.  
He said that he needed to do this to account for additional sagging that 
would occur in the future.  (It is true that previously, the left side sagged 
a little more than the right.)  Also, I keep the water tank filled and the 
closet filled with gear--both on the right side.  On the other hand, I have a 
size 24 battery on the left.  In any case, when I am in the Westy without 
passengers, it is level side to side so I can live with the 1/4.&quot; 

OK, it has been eight years and contrary to his opinion, there as been almost 
no additional sagging.  At this point, the sliding door sill is level in 
relation to the ground when unoccupied.  Without passengers, the I can see 
the horizon just at the top of the rear window which is just fine. You need 
to be aware of what is close behind you and little kids, etc., so it is 
better to see lower than higher.  Who cares what's on the horizon.  

(I have had a 6X8&quot; frezel &quot;eye&quot; mounted on the lower middle of my rear window 
for about 10 years.  It has gotten a little yellow, but still works great.  
The bottom edge of the lens is just below the top edge of the rear seat as 
seen through the mirror.  I can see little kids when I'm backing up and it 
helps me gauge how much room I have behind me when parking because I can see 
the front bumper of the car behind me.  It also helps me see some of the left 
blind spot area--don't hack up your cabinet.  Get one, they're cheap.)

Anyway, I haven't had any problems with handling or CV joints with the rear 
end up a little over stock.  Still have the originals with no damage to the 
original boots either after almost 200K.  Get lots of complements on the 
looks and it's nice to have the ground clearance under the engine too.  
However, I agree with George, that if the rear is way too high, you will have 
the problems he mentioned.  The lower the vehicle (in general and not 
excessively), the better the handling as you lower the center of gravity.  

My advice:  Raise the rear up to stock height and no higher.  Install the 
frezel lens &quot;eye.&quot;
