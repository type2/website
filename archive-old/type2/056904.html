	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;I barely have to step on the brake to stop... total pedal travel
is less
&gt;than an inch... is that how it is supposed to be? I used to have
to push
&gt;it past the gas pedal and the pedal was a lot easier to push...
&gt;


Huh,
when my brake booster worked it would go down past the gas pedal
with very little pressure from my foot.
Now that the brake booster is shot, I only have to press the
pedal about an inch, but I have to use mucho foot pressure.

When your brake booster goes, turn around that one way pressure
valve in the engine compartment so you don't keep pumping air
into the carb and affecting your idle. When (if) you fix it ,
turn it back around.  : )~

May your VW live long and putter,
Thom
