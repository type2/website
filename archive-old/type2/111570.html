Subject: Re: [T2] can't seem to get bus started

&quot;So I put the 009 back on checked everything and no start. Bus does smell to be dunping too much gas though.Please help!! I feel this is something real simple that I am overlooking and when it is discovered I'm gonna slap myself.&quot;Sounds like timing and or firing order.When you are TDC, # 1 cyl should have both intake and exhaust valves closed, with the piston out as far as it goes.The TDC mark on the pulley should line up with the center of the case.  Also the slot in the distributor drive gear should be parallel to the line made by the front of the case, the thin part of the slot in the gear should be towards the rear.  If that is all good make sure the rotor lines up to the notch on the dizzy, then check to make sure all plug wires are in the right order 1-4-3-2 (cw).Check all your plugs to make sure they are not fouled.P. G.
