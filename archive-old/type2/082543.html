John,

I remember paying the same $40 here in DC that you paid in WV.  As you
say, tho... price it around!  I got quotes all over the place for the same
job.

On coating:

I advise against it.  I have posted this before, but here it is again:

Back in the 60s/70s they used to use a coating on tanks with shellac in
it.  Worked fine.  In the 80s, gas was reformulated  with ethanol and
methanol, which disolved the shellac.  gummed up a bunch of older cars to
a fare-thee-well!  Coaters changed their formulation and now current
coatings are safe with current gasoline formulations.  The question is...
how about in 10 years?  what will they add that will disolve thes current
coatings?????  My newest bus is 22 years old, and I anticipate that I will
still be driving it in 10 years and do not want to find out what disolves
the current generation of coatings.

Bare steel if fine if you keep gas running thru it.  If you intend to
store it, slosh some oil around in it every 3 months or so and store it in
a dry place 'til you are ready to install/use it!
