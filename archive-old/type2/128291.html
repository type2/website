Subject: OOOPS  Alternator fried?  

OK.  While I'm doing a couple of things on the
bus, like tightening down the alternator.  I
notice that my 3 year old drops a glass and I run
over to get him out of the shards. 
Unfortunately, by ratchet fell and grounded out
that big post on the alternator to the point of
being red hot and smoking.  Obviously, the big
wire from the battery needs to be replaced.  It
is toast.  Also the alternator strap was
completely burnt in two. 

Any chance the alternator survived or should I
just stop what I'm doing and get a new one?  

Not so happy bussin' today
Ray
