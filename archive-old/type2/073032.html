Lately there have been complaints that questions aren't being answered (we
never know who took care of it in pmail) so you get the benefit of my
inexperience:

I think Mofoco will rebush carbs for cheap, probably lots of other places
with better work ethics will do it, check the archives to be sure. It
doesn't need rebushing if it doesn't leak gas. Rebuild it first and see.

&gt;They also said that you cant purchase
&gt;new carbsfor this model.

Well...you probably don't need new carbs anyway but I knew Josh Rodgers to
pick up a pair of Solexes at a swap here, in like new condition, including
manifolds, for $15. Because I wouldn't give ten for them. They aren't
available OEM but that's nothing to get excited about. Maybe a deal won't
fall in your lap like that but these things are not diamonds.

&gt;I have herd of people
&gt;putting 1.8L ford motors in their busses. Is it possible to put my rabbit
&gt;motor in the bus. If so where can I get a conversion.

Corey. Listen. That is a logistical and economic nightmare. Just soak it in
a bucket of carb cleaner, put in new gaskets, and then tell us where you
are.
