do you have an aftermarket radio or amp installed?  Many times they're 
wired straight to the positive battery terminal w/ a separate feed line. 
  Also, do you have any extra wires going to your positive terminal?  If 
I remember correctly, the stock setup has a fat starter wire, a red wire 
to the double relay, and possibly another wire to the aux battery relay. 
  Anything else is most likely aftermarket.  I think there might be one 
more that goes to the test socket if you have that still..

 From the starter runs a wire to the front to power most everything. 
However, I think every connection from that point forward is 
fuse-protected so nothing should be pulling power if you have all the 
fuses out.

I'm assuming you have your ignition switch off when you're doing your 
testing?

If you don't already have it, you should get a bentley manual as it will 
show you what your wiring is *supposed* to look like.
