&gt; &gt; hey mike  Did he reinstall the head gaskets?  these have been known to

&gt; I believe that the only thing he reinstalled were the cylinder shims

&gt; will find out, though.
&gt;
&gt; As far as I knew, those were no longer used...


officially they are no longer used, however some heads (including AVP)
require them to function properly,  my rule of thumb has been if they
had gaskets uuse gaskets and if they didn't have gaskets then don't
use any.
