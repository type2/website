&gt;Under normal circumstances if everything is off 
&gt;you should have infinite resistance if you connect one lead to the

&gt;even to the negative terminal but I wouldn't recommend that cause its
&gt;safer to make your ground connection away from the battery...won't
&gt;spark and/or ignite hydrogen fumes which may be around battery.
&gt;

unfortunately, if you do that, you will blow the fuse in your meter.  When checking resistance you must be disconnected from the power suply.    And if you have a cheap meter, it might not have a fuse, you'll just need a new meter.
