John,
    Back away from that engine case and put that torch down, NOW !
Don't do anything foolish sir, back away and put the torch down.

Ok, now we'll get that case apart.  While I don't know the exact count for 
each type and size of fastener, there are a few that people  often overlook, 
especially when splitting a type 4 case the first time.  Here's where to 
look;
    1.  Remove the flywheel as you will find at least one behind it.
    2.  Now look at the left side of the engine (drivers side) below and a 
little forward  of
         the #4 cylinder there is another bolt.  It's down in that recessed 
area above the
         oil sump and holds the oil pick up in place as well as holding the 
case together.
Now tap at the corners with your wood and rubber mallet and the case should 
seperate.
I would not use those wedges in the split line as you might damage the 
parting surfaces, which will cause an oil leak when you put it all back 
together.
    I hope this helps, and if you want, feel free to e-mail me off  list.
