&gt; I have a hydro case so I guess utill I pull the engine for the next rebuild
&gt; and split the case there is no way to make this cut out right?

read below. i don't suggest cutting the case at all.

&gt; Without the cutout what would you suggest be the next best location for the
&gt; sender? Dipstick? I know they read to high but better that than to low. Do
&gt; you know if the dipstick sender reacts as quick as it should?

i am not saying it doesn't work on a hydro case - it just works differently.
if you have the 914 plate, get the short vdo sender and use it, you will get
used to reading the gauge and how it reacts. it is accurate IMO, just
&quot;lazy&quot;. aren't we all a bit this way?
