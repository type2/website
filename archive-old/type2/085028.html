Subject: RE: Various MC notes for conversion to bay unit

I forgot to mention the relevance for the Type2 list :)

Some of this process is applicable for the early bay windows with front
drums.

-------------------------- 

&gt; A few notes on the conversion of the single chamber MC in the split to a
&gt; later disk brake baywindow MC.
&gt; 
&gt; Eric &amp; Barb have a great write-up on this process in the Library section.
&gt; Please be familiar with that article to get an idea of what I am doing the
&gt; same or differently than they outline.
&gt; 
&gt; Also note this is not installed yet and the actual installation will take
&gt; place in a few weeks when other associated front brake parts arrive.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay I am starting with a Wolfgang International conversion kit (Part
&gt; Number 2611011 www.wolfgangint_dot_com ).  I spoke with Steve there who was
&gt; very helpful in comparing the information Eric&amp;Barb gave to what this kit
&gt; either eliminates or makes more complicated.  The kit is basically a
&gt; spacer for the MC so that the piston rod does not need to be altered and
&gt; matching longer bolts.  This keeps all of the components as stock as
&gt; possible if you decide to switch back to the single chamber MC.
&gt; 
&gt; Some list members have said they have gotten this same kit locally at
&gt; their VW FLAPS, but I have never seen this kit outside of the Wolfgang
&gt; webpage.  I assumed it was an EMPI part, but it is not in their 2001
&gt; dealer catalog either.   
&gt; 
&gt; The largest difference in Eric&amp;Barbs instructions is that Wolfgang
&gt; recommends removing the front brake light sensor and putting the front
&gt; line directly in that hole.  This eliminates the need for a &quot;T&quot; fitting.
&gt; We will see what happens when I install it...
&gt; 
&gt; As I previously mentioned the Porsche 924 fluid reservoir is a perfect fit
&gt; for this application and holds more fluid than the Rabbit fluid holder...
&gt; This is what happens when you hang out in the junkyard too much :)
&gt; 
&gt; The final plan entails the addition of early Porsche 944 front disc brakes
&gt; to my '66.  The calipers are the easiest to rebuild and use that I have
&gt; ever seen!  The rotors are massive at 11+ some odd inches (same rotors on
&gt; the 911) and should provide enough grip to embarrass some SUVs.   Please
&gt; contact Old Speed http://www.oldspeed_dot_com/service.htm for more
&gt; information, they have been very helpful.  Also if anyone is interested I
&gt; have extra front calipers and good used rotors left over, make me a
&gt; reasonable offer and yes it is WAY less than Old Speed would charge.  The
&gt; kit gets cheap when you supply your own stuff :)
&gt; 
&gt; The rear brakes are still a puzzle I am trying to put together.  For the
&gt; short term I will try the EMPI adapter plates to Porsche 5 lug, but it is
&gt; a poor long term solution.  Really want to install 944 rear brakes and 944
&gt; MC, but have not found a good way yet w/o serious and expensive
&gt; changes....  At stock height with 215/75R15 tires...  Yah that is the
&gt; killer, if I wanted 3&quot; drop it would be a very easy conversion.  
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully this post will be inspirational and thought provoking to someone
&gt; out there ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy &amp; Safe Journeys,
