Subject: BA-6 gas heater FS

Well, here I am enjoying the beautiful Wisconsin summer, and lacking the
provocation of harsh winters, I am offering for sale the BA-6 gas heater
I purchased from Ron Salmon approximately a year ago. It is complete, in
good condition, and comes with a reprint of the service manual. For more
information regarding the installation and servicing of the unit, see
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/ba6art.htm

Catch me now while the heat has made me mad as an Englishman (or dog).
$225 plus shipping for everything.
