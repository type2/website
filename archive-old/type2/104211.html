Subject: Re: [T2] friday content:  Duct Tape

&gt; I was wondering if any other bus driver's are having to make the same
&gt; difficult decision...........
&gt;
&gt; I cannot decide if I want to &quot;risk it&quot; and take the roll of duct tape out of
&gt; my bus  and use it in my new Homeland Security Terrorism Protection kit.

No I think you better get another roll of plastic to ensafenate the bus in
case if WMD.
