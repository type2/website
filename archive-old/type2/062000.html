&gt; John Jensen in Annapolis...A excellent point... and it possibly explains why you are still able to 
write about your experiences.

Lifting a car on jacks is usually the most &quot;adventurous&quot; part of the 
work, in my experience. I've had a car roll off while lifting with a 
bumper jack (sideways), and our VW bus roll forward using the stock 
screw jack. After lifting and blocking a van in my parent's garage (I 
was 15 at the time), I gave it the manditory shove. The front wheel 
chock began to slide on the smooth concrete floor, as the van rolled 
forward off the supporting blocks. With me hanging onto the rear bumper, 
being pulled forward, while screaming at the top of my lungs (I dunno... 
something like &quot;stop, you cross-eyed vermin&quot;)... I managed to stop it 
from rolling too far forward, and it stopped about 3 inches from the 
washer/dryer.

I learned to place carefully place the garage jack (one with the wheels 
turned to allow it to roll in the direction of the lift). If you don't 
have a wheeled floor jack, try to support the vehicle with a second jack 
and/or intermediate supports. Blocks of wood are better than nothing.

Always shake the vehicle violently before crawling under it. When you 
remove the wheels, shove them under the sides of the car. If it falls, 
it will avoid damaging the vehicle's underside. Better, put 2 tires 
under each side (if you have spares). Now, if it falls with you under 
it, you'll have that additional safety margin.

This probably saved my friend's life. With 16.5 tires pulled off the 
rear of his PU, we had work to do on brakes. When I pulled the tires, I 
shoved them under the car, as is my habit (it also gets them out of the 
way). I went for more beer, and there was a terrible crash. One of the 
heavy duty jackstands must have let loose, with him under the truck. It 
was only the tire that saved his life. He was pinned, but completely 
unharmed (except for extreme adrenelin shock). Later we found the 
locking pall on the jackstand had snapped.
