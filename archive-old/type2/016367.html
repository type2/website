Subject: New electrical problem?
References: &lt;199810261756.KAA30780_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

Hey, Guys:

I had a NEW (at least to me...) electrical problem last Friday.  I drove Brunhilda into
the driveway from work, went inside to let the dogs out, and returned back to the rig to
go to the store.  Turned the key.  Nothing.  I had electrical power to my dash lights and
the stereo, but no joy on the starter turning.  Not even a &quot;click&quot;.

I climbed underneath and checked the starter connections.  I checked the fuzes.  I checked
everything I could think of, and still couldn't figure out the problem.  Finally, I called
my mechanic, and had my wife in the Subaru wagon tow me and the thing into the shop.  I
dropped the car off, gave the key to my guru, and waited until Monday for news.

It turns out that I had something go wrong INTERNALLY in my battery that caused it to
break the circuit.  My VW guy replaced the pos and neg cables and the battery, and it
fired right up.  It was strange, because the Bus has been running and starting fine,
without any indication of a weak or moribund battery.  This is the first time in a
lifetime of driving that I have had this happen with a battery.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  If not, add it to the seemingly endless list of
stuff that can go wrong with a Bus electrical system!

Don Kaag
