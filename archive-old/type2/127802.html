Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 in a 74

&gt; course I'm assuming that the engine bay of a NA spec
&gt; bus and a South American
&gt; bus are identical - are they?

I am not sure on that. The Brazilian buses very pretty
much splitwindow buses with a baywindow cabin until
the late 90ties. I don't know what they are producing
now. It might very well be that they 'upgraded' the
engine bay as well.

I live in Europe and most of my late bays have the
Type 1 engine in there originally. The engine tin is
different, that's true. But the 'moustache bar' to
mount the engine is different as well, just like the
rubbers on this mount.

The air filter and holder could also be different.

The gearbox is mounted to the chassis just like on a
US bus. But beware that a Type 1 engine might not like
the Type 4 gearbox. Because of fitting reasons but
also because of the gear ratios.

If you need any pictures let me know.

yours,



Vincent
