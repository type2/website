Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

&gt; mention of no firewall in the engine compartments of '68s, is this true?

yes and no. Ive had a deluxe with and a kombi without.

&gt; On a semi-related note, does anyone know what years they used the door locks
&gt; down next to the interior handle on the front doors rather than the more
&gt; standard top-pull position?  And does anyone know why they changed?

im not sure about the lock but I think the handle button got changed from
68 to 69 due to DOT regulations.
