Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday]

That puzzled me, too.  It definitely had the rear corner windows, because I made a point of checking that in several shots.

Perhaps it wasn't a '66 or '67, but especially in the early part of the film the rig looked so new you could almost smell the upholstery.

I doubt an internet search for the movie would turn up details of the vehicles [there were also some very nice Mercedes-Benz 300 saloons].  I'll just have to watch it again when I can - not a problem as it's a good movie :-)

===========================================

&gt;If it is a 23 window wouldn&quot;t it have to be 1963 at the 
&gt;newest?
