Hi volks,

&gt; On my visits to the USA I have made the following observations:
&gt; 
&gt; - Approx.  98 % percent of their cars are automatics. I don't think at
&gt; matters as far as the drivers license goes.

 Seems so. Wild...

&gt; - taking a driving test seems to be a very simple procedure 
&gt; compared to the
&gt; very rigorous testing in Europe.

 I wouldn't say European testing was rigorous- in the UK, at least,
something like 55% of drivers pass first time after only a dozen or so
lessons. There is no requirement to retake the test, unless you fall
foul of the courts, and a medical isn't required after you pass 70,
as long as you have a statement from a doctor that you are fit.
 Maybe Dutch standards are higher? In which case roll on further
European integration! There is no shortage of poor driving in the UK,
and I'm led to believe that standards arn't radically different in 
other European countries.
 
&gt; - The 'hand-brake' on an automatic is often a foot-pedal. 
&gt; That makes it a
&gt; bit awkward in hill-starts.

 OK: but that's not a problem for an auto.

&gt; This explains why some of our American listees have problems 
&gt; driving their
&gt; manual buses.

 Hmm, yes. I suppose I was aware of the issue but not how 
widespread it was. Although I've visited the States most
of my car-culture knowledge of the country comes from
participating on this and similar (eg Porsche) lists. It's
becoming clear that this is a pretty unrepresentative sample...

Cheers,
	  W.

PS Sorry for the thin bus content.
