Subject: Re: [T2] broken oil strainer bolt?

Hey Chris,

This will probably sound like heresy to most of the list, but when I 
broke that bolt I used JB Weld to hold it in, keeping my fingers crossed 
for about 3 years until I was ready to rebuild. Never gave me any 
problems except maybe the occasional drop of oil. When I broke it, I 
heard a piece snap off and drop, so it was pretty severe.
