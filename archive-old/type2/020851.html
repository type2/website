Subject: Re: [T2] one more tach question

About diodes: A diode is the simplest type of semiconductor. Basically,
it acts like a conductor (wire) for current travelling in one direction,
and
like an insulator for current travelling in the other direction. It
works this
way up to a certain point, but if you exceed the rated voltage, you will

fry it. So, when it says 1000 V, that is the &quot;breakdown&quot; voltage. It has

nothing to do with the actual voltage in the circuit.

When your points are closed, the potential from the coil to ground is
approximately 12 V. When the points are open, the voltage falls to zero.

The condensor is there to keep the voltage from falling so rapidly that
an arc jumps across the points, but let's just say it falls quickly to
zero. In a running engine, the points are opening and closing many
times per second. The dwell is proportional to the percentage of time
the
points are closed. When you measure the dwell, you are really just
measuring the average voltage in the circuit. The tach, I believe,
measures
the average current in the tach circuit.

If your crankshaft endplay is out of spec, it can have an oscillatory
effect
on the timing. In-and-out motion of the crank is transmitted to the
distributer
shaft where it becomes rotary motion. Have you noticed that your timing
mark does not stay in one spot when you check it with a strobe light? If

so, this could be due to excessive endplay and could possibly be the
cause
of  your tach problems. Or not :^)
