&gt;What a great bunch of really sharp people we have out there on this list !
&gt;I'm impressed ................ again !
&gt;

I totally agree!!!  Thank you!!!  I just went out and bought a big fire 
extinguisher (all we had was a little one) and I'm on the way to go get new 
oil gaskets.  Thank you all for the amazingly quick response!!!

So far I've found that the oil level *is* high -- VERY high.  But I can't 
tell if it smells like gasoline or not, as the whole area around the bus 
smells like gas, and I have a really bad cold, so my smeller isn't working 
very well.  It does seem really thin, though, so I'm guessing that's the 
problem.

Just out of curiosity...  Under the leaking carb, there is a &quot;crystal&quot; 
formation growing, right where the gas is dripping.  I didn't know it until 
I had my head, shoulders and half my torso stuffed into the engine 
compartment.  It's about the diameter of a quarter or 1/2 dollar, and about 
1&quot; high in the center.  I'm assuming it's from the gasoline.  How long would 
it take something like this to form.  The bus has smelled a bit gassy the 
last few times we drove it (we usually take public transit), and I'm 
wondering if this thing's been dripping for a while and we just didn't 
notice.

As for why we have an electrical gas pump, the old mechanical one died, 
leaving us stranded 40 miles from home.  Landon picked up an electrical one 
because that was all that was available at the time.  He's been working on 
rebuilding the stock one, but needs a diaphragm or something that he hasn't 
been able to find.  We had a reputable VW mechanic look at the electric one, 
and he said that it was fine (if I remember correctly, it was running at 3 
PSI).  But the intention is and always has been to put the stock one back 
on.

Now as far as Tim's comment goes, we probably put about 1/2 of our &quot;spending 
money&quot; into the bus and my bug.  They are by no means neglected.  In fact, 
quite the opposite.  Our cats would easily argue that we spend more time 
with the bus then we do with them.  It's a good thing we don't have kids, 
because if we did, *they* would be neglected.  Most of our weekends (and 
evenings when it was light out)are spent in the driveway doing *something* 
to one of the vehicles, usually the bus.  When necessary, even in the 
downpouring rain.  Meanwhile Landon and I are surviving usually on generic 
TopRamen and non-Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese.  Don't even try to tell me we don't 
love our VWs!!!!  If we didn't we wouldn't have bought them in the first 
place.  And certainly would have given up by now!!!

And personally, I think Landon deserves to take his first vacation in 2-1/2 
years, and my 5-year old nephew deserves a Christmas present.  It's just 
unfortunate that this problem had to occur while Landon was gone, not to 
mention that it had to occur at all.  But like all things VW, it's going to 
be another learning experience.  Not only in how to fix it, but how to avoid 
having it happen again.

So, thank you all again for your advice!

Karen
