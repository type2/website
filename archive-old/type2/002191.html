Hey Folks,
    Well, spent most of the weekend just like almost every weekend lately,
working on the '77 (follow the link below, click on resto progress to see
latest pictures). Late this afternoon I headed into town to get gas for my
lawn mower when a storm suddenly hit-I'd left the '77 sitting out with no
windows, doors, and a nose that had just been sanded down and primered, and
it got soaked. It has always been my understanding that primer is porous,
and bare metal simply painted with primer will rust, and in fact, if you've
ever seen a car with West Virginia tags you know what I mean (sorry,
couldn't resist). I figure at this point I'm screwed, the primer has soaked
up all this moisture and it's gonna start rusting, and maybe I should sand
it all off and repaint again as soon as I get the chance. Then, reading the
directions on the can (what a concept) I see it recommends wet sanding the
primer before topcoating. Wouldn't this force moisture into the primer to
the metal below? Maybe I'm not screwed after all! Can any experts out there
shed any light on this? Did the primered area, basically the entire nose
sanded down to bare metal, incur any harm by getting wet? The primer is
Tempo brand, made by Valspar.  TIA, Jeff
