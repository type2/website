Subject: Small irritants


I have my 79 Sunroof Bay running well now. At least the engine.

Kinda....

I have a series of tiny glitches that make me worry. 

1. For the first mile or so, it has a bit of &quot;cold start&quot; syndrome. It does 
not want to idle correctly and it &quot;hesitates&quot; just a bit on takeoff and gear 
change. Unless I nearly floorboard it, it does not want to run smoothly. 

2. After that clears up (about 1 - 2 miles of cantankerous driving), it idles 
well, accelerates nicely and handles all shifts well.

3. However, when I am not careful on releasing the clutch (very gently 
normally, too quick causes the problem) I get a huge lurch and bump in the 
engine area. Loud and distinct bump and lurch....

4. Finally, on occasion, it wants to pop out of first. First only. 

Anybody seen these symptoms? Clearly they can be multiple problems, but I 
suspect a common thread. 

Thanks in advance, 
Chuck

00 Eurovan - Mama just put the first ding in it...ugh. 

And if I don't do something drastic soon, Mama will buy a 2001 New Beetle. 
She just loves them. Any opinions about those?
