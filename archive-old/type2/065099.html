Thank you. Batteries are always seen as something that sits idly in the 
corner... and only become a problem when the vehicle won't start.

I've only seen 2 types of &quot;explosions&quot; in batteries, those caused by a 
spark, and those with plugged vents. In the former, when a battery 
charges, it gives off hydrogen and oxygen... a very explosive 
combination, as we all learned in chemistry class. In the second case, 
it was in a defective battery. The vent hole was not formed properly (it 
was nonexistant). The battery built enough pressure internally to 
finally explode. The owner said he'd notice the side walls were somewhat 
swelled (&quot;like an overripe tomato&quot;).

My Caravan was equipped w/ a maintenance free battery. After the 
&quot;maintenance free&quot; battery in my car died, I learned from the experts. 
They said that ALL batteries need to have water added, and they all have 
vents. I pried the top off the Caravan battery (broke the seals) and 
found the water level at the top of the cells. I probably extended its 
life by 2 years by adding water.

I enjoyed reading your battery posting. Thanks again.
