Subject: External Oil Cooler (AKA New Long Thread)

Volks- Yes, I checked and re-checked the archives. I just got a
plate-style oil cooler, and I know where I want to mount it, which side
the oil filter goes on... ect. What I DON'T know is this: 

1) The oil cooler came with 5/8 inch Inner Diameter hose. It looks HUGE!
The oil filter relocation kit came with 1/2 ID hose. I have the adaptors
to make everything fit the 1/2 ID hose, and I can drill out and tap the
new oil filter kit so it will fit the 5/8 ID hose. Which size hose whould
be BETTER? My logic ran like this- The bigger the hose, the less the oil
pump has to work to squeeze the oil through that hole,  more oil gets to
and through the cooler, and that means better cooling.  Or does it?

2) I didn't get a fan for my cooler. I am going to mount the cooler up
next to the tranny, flat against the bottom of the bus (or somewhere near
there, but basically, flat, up against the bottom of the bus). In reading
the archives, only about half the messages I read mentioned having a fan.
I didn't know if this meant that the other half didn't have a fan, or
just didn't mention it.  Is anybody out there running a cooler mounted
flush against the bottom of the bus and NOT running a fan? 
I've got the electric radiator fan from my old Subaru (about the only
part that survived the accident), and that fits perfectly over the
cooler. *IF*  I do need a fan, will this do? 
	Thanks, thanks, thanks (garsh, I love this list).
