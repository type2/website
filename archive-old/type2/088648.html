Subject: Re: Rubber Steps for a 68-72 front bumper-followup

Today I received 2 brand new WCM rubber front steps for my 70 front bumper.
Some may remember my post from a week or so ago bemoaning the impossiblility
of reinstalling my rock hard and shrunken old original rubber steps on my
freshly blasted and painted bumper. Well, I haven't installed the new ones
yet, but I held them in place and they look great, they seem to line up and
be the right size. Got a great deal on a new pair from:   Listee Bob. He may
have more, maybe try him and see if you are having the same problem I was. I
paid him via Paypal and got them in a week to Canada.  Great deal and thanks
Bob! Tom

&lt; I have a set of the new ones (from West Coast Metric) for sale.  They're
$35.00 for the pair.
