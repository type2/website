Subject: fire

Sorta Type2 related.  I'm smoking the turkey in my gas smoker. On the table next to it is sitting POR-15 prep products.  Metal Ready and I don't remember the name of the other one.  And a couple of oven mitts and a propane grill lighter.  It's running along at 300F.  I go to the store, come back, and the table is on fire.  What would have ignited first?  Is the POR-15 stuff that flamable??  Probably it was the lighter which was right underneath the cloth mitts.  But it was a nice fire.  Just glad it didn't interfere with the great looking and smelling turkey that we'll enjoy tomorrow.  But  that POR-15 stuff is not cheap!  I'm just glad I didn't have the $30 POR-15 can sitting there.  It was inside the house.  And I'm glad the house is brick.  Whew...KR
