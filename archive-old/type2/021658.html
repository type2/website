Subject: Re: [T2] Side window stuck

Paul !

Thanks for help put..
How did you got the dammed thing out of the door ??
It is stuck behind the window guide channel which I can't remove
(I have taken out the screw holding the channel)
Btw, I cut a hole in the panel to get access to the screws
holding the window.

Joe !

Had a look at your site, got java error when using NetScape 4.77
And I was unable to specify lifter for left door, only for
right door.

&gt; These are not that hard to get out, I guess that could be said for ones that
&gt; are not broken. We sell quality used regulators for $25.00. We clean,
&gt; regrease, and inspect for any damage. We guarantee all our products for 30
&gt; days.

&gt; 
&gt; I just did this exact same thing in my '72.  The window was stuck in the
&gt; almost up position (about 3 inches from the top.)  The handle just spun
&gt; when turned, window wouldn't go up or down.
&gt; The Bentley is right on about how to remove the rather large mechanism
&gt; (regulator), but it can still be a pain in the A, especially when the
&gt; window won't go down.
&gt; So the gears of the mechanism are stripped and must be replaced.  It is
&gt; all one piece and must be replace as such.  I removed all the bolts
&gt; (seven in all) and slid the whole unit down until I could remove the
&gt; bolts holding the window to the lifter (the left &quot;arm&quot; of the mechanism
&gt; had to be pulled out of the door to do this.)  And then removed the
&gt; mechanism per Bentley.
&gt; note - after doing this, I realized that the window was only resting on
&gt; the 2 bolts that hold it to the lifter.  You may be able to simply lift
&gt; the window off those bolts to lower it.
&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; ----
&gt; &gt;Left side window lifting mechanism is stuck.
&gt; Nothing happens when I turn the handle.
&gt; According to Bentley I must lower the window to remove
&gt; the lifter. But I can't move the window down,
&gt; it is stuck in the mechanism.
&gt; So, what to do, use(more) violence to push the
&gt; window down or what ??
