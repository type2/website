FYI to anyone in the DC area:

This Saturday the 22nd, there is a car show in Maryland Silver Spring
area.  It is at the Colesville Rec Center.  I called and the hombre said
its for all cars and asked what I had, told him, and he said great!
Bring it! So I thought , hey...lets amaze the ordinary folk with several
type-3's.  The show is from 10 am to 3 pm, and its FREE. yup, no fees
for anything, I say lets show up in all types of VW's, Bugs, Ghias,
Fastys, Squares, Buses, Golfs, etc...bring them all.  Ill be there at
about 9:30 to get a good spot I hope.
The number for directions is 301-384-9094 .  Location is listed as Hobbs
Dr. off New Hampshire Ave.
Any one else into going? Sounds like great low stress fun.  Did i
mention FREE : )
