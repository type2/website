&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I plan on doing a subaru engine conversion in the future. Since I have
&gt; an '81 air-cooled model, I will need to install a radiator and the
&gt; associated plumbing. I looked through the archives and did not find much
&gt; 
&gt; info on installing one, or how to do it, and would the one that's in the
&gt; 
&gt; VW water boxer be adequate?. If the one that is used by the water boxer
&gt; would work, how difficult is it to install?. Has anyone done this? Any
&gt; help or ideas are greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.

Maybe, but maybe the one from the diesel vanagon might fit better. The
diesels were imported 82-83 only in the US. This is the same basic
vintage as your car. I know the diesel and waterboxer radiators mount
differently.
Let us know how you come out, sounds like an interesting conversion.
