Subject: Re: split-window trans

&gt;but me myself,  i live with the nature of the beast. 
&gt; vw buses were designed to be an inexpensive, efficient, easy to work on
&gt; delivery van.   not a high speed sports car.   i say, if you aren't happy
&gt;going 55-60 tops, you don't want a splittie.   you'll spend too much time and
&gt;money trying to make it something it isn't.

Aha!  Let me say that I am in complete agreement--  I am a vintage nut and I
drive like your grandmother.  When I _had_ a high speed sports car I still
drove only 60mph!  I'm not the racer type, and believing as I do in the old
maxim &quot;right tool for the right job&quot; I would never expect that kind of stuff
from my beloved Volksie.

That being said (just so you know that my next question to the list isn't
going to be &quot;what's the easiest way to lower my bus six inches and how hard
is it to chop the roof off?&quot;), I am at present forced to make unusual
demands on the bus.  I live in a city, which means I would like better
brakes than the stock setup so I can avoid crazed hot-rodders (the guys in
the lowered beetles whose brake lights don't work!).  The mountains nearby
add to this need.  Hills also need to be ascended safely, and that to me
means not having to unduly impede traffic.  It doesn't help that people on
this coast drive like lunatics, and don't seem to mind endangering
themselves and others with ridiculous and negligent stunts to go just that
little bit faster.  Anyway, the bottom line is that right now I need to make
my split just a bit more, for lack of a better word, 'competitive.'  BUT I
don't want to destroy it (i.e. &quot;make it something it isn't&quot;), so I am hoping
that I can find options that a)will help the bus be more suited to its
present situation and b)be completely reversible so that I can return it to
bone stock as soon as I can change that situation.

Help!  I'm not a customizer!! Honest!  I'm a nice guy, really!
