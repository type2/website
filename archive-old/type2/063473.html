&gt;I would like an opinion on which book, if any, is good for information on 
&gt;buying a Type 2 bus - things to look for / check etc.

You might want to try Lindsay Porter's DIY Guide to Restoration - Beetle and Transporter, published by Haynes over there in the UK.

It has buying tips as well as a good restoration guide.
