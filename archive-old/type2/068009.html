Subject: Maggie Progress Report Day Next--Warning to auto owners, too!

Ok, so I forgot what day I'm on.  Sue me.  The Warning's down at the bottom.

Jonathan:  I'm totally down with you.  Except my front seal's been replaced :)

Furthur:

CVs:  repacked.

Face, Hands, Coveralls: covered in CV grease.

A lot of fuel line: replaced.

Still waiting: tools to replace wheel bearings (lender is out of town)

Got to drop the tranny to replace seal between tranny and final drive.  I'm
gonna try to reinstall engine and trans together.  Wish me luck on that!

Discovered possible new problem (see other post)

Warning!!  All automatic Owners!!!

If my bus is typical, and not screwed up, one of my CV shafts is longer
than the other.  Well, one of mine is regardless of screwed upness.  But if
my bus is typical, then one of YOUR shafts is longer, too.  If you drop
them, you would do well to keep them straight.  This also means you cannot
switch sides with your CV joints.

I know everyone saw the nice orange bus in millenium.  I just wonder where
they got all those nice orange busSES for that one scene! :)


Talk to you soon,
Eric &amp; Maggie
