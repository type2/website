Subject: '71 rear brake woes

I wanted to have a look at my rear brakes, removed the 11mm bolts and 
pounded on drums, drums would not move. Tried to back off adjusting stars, 
but they are basically frozen.
----- How can I get the drums off??
----- Is the amount of lining I'm seeing thru the inspection holes fairly 
representitve of the entire lining surface??
No real problems w brakes, pedal height is good, no apparent cylinder 
leakage, and ~3/16&quot; of lining thru the inspection hole, but I've never had a 
look in there (tho have had the rear bearings greased) and have put 
120k(mostly road miles) on them since purchace from PO.
Any suggestions appreciated.
Thanks
