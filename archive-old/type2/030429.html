Subject: Locating the Timing Mark on T4 Engines
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9905171858390.18836-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Faced with the problem of locating the correct mark on an unknown T4
engine, I offer the following advice:  

If you look at the center of the fan, you will see a keyway cut into the
edge of the hole the bolt goes in. If you draw an imaginary line from the
center of the fan, through the right (clockwise) edge of that notch and
proceed mentally to the rim, then move ~3-5 degrees to clockwise of that,
you will find that you are close to the timing notch.  As others have
stated the notch is in the forward edge of the pulley that carries the
distributor belt, but once you are that close, you will usually find that
someone has carved a secondary notch in the rear as well (this is *not*
the stock notch, and may not be as accurate as you would like!)

T1 engines carry a bewildering array of different notches, but the T4
should only ever have the one, and it is always at TDC when the scale says
it is.

On the scale, as far as I know, the T4 used only one from 72-83, and VW
still sells them!  Which is nice because my engines tend to eat them :-(
