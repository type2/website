Well, the heater is independent of the thermostat, and as long as the
engine is getting hot enough, you will get just as much heat as if you
didn't have the thermostat.  Remember, the failsafe position for the
flaps is such that the cylinders are being cooled, so, it really
wouldn't make much difference... well, the only difference really is
that the engine would heat up faster.. but it's still going to get to
operating temperature regardless...  I guess that's my point..
especially after driving on the freeway!

Here's an easy way to check out how much heat is coming out.  If you've
ever looked under the bus at how the flapper boxes function, you'll
notice the heat is either sent out to the open air or through the
ducting.. in other words, it's always on (the engine fan is always
blowing).  So, drive for a little while and get the engine nice and hot.
   While it is running, push your heater levers up (off position) and
carefully put your hand in the path of the air that is being exhausted
from the flapper box.  If that air is hot, then you know the culprit
lies somewhere between the flapper boxes and the cabin.

It *should* be really dang hot.  Right now with my working system, I
cannot keep my hands in front of the duct as it's waaaaay too hot.  I
don't have a huge amount of flow, but the air's definitely toasty.  This
is after I put in all new ducting from front to rear..
