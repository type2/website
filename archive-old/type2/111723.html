&gt; &gt; I think it's a great idea, but of course we'll need new T-shirts!  :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Cool!  That means our old-style t-shirts will skyrocket in value! ;-)

WOW!  I was reading the web site and saw this and all I have to say
is .....

FS: Original AIRS swearshirt, $400 with authentic VW grease stains!

After all, as anyone who has seen me will tell you I am as big as a tent,
might as well price it as one :-)

I agree with George that consulting with Charlie is an excellent idea, but
it's jake with me!
