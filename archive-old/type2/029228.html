There are flexible lines in the front and the back. Actually, I don't know about all years, but '64-72 have both...and I'd bet a set of brake shoes that all bays do, since there is a need for flex in the system. The brake lines run $10-20 each, depending on where you get them. I've found Bus Depot, or my FLAPs to have the best prices. BD doesn't FedEx, though, so if you're in a hurry, check elsewhere (confessed COI: I work for FedEx...but still, we're the only dependable overnight service for my money and parts).

Bus Boys has had a bad reputation among list members in the past. I heard that they're under new management, but for many of us, they probably still have something to prove even if they are...and I haven't heard from the guy at the Bus Boys address that they're under new management; just a rumor on the list. By all means, step out and do business with them and report back to us, many of whom are too shy to send them money or credit card numbers in the wake of casualties laying along the roadside. Takes a long time to repair that level of bad press.

To find the flexible lines in the rear, crawl under the bus, at the middle/back. Follow the metal line that goes into the wheel up; it curves; curves again. There! There's that other flexible line! There's one on the other side in just about the same place. To remove them, you must pry that clip off. It's a horseshoe thing, with the holding power being in the shape of the clip. I usually wiggle them off with vice grips or a BFS (big f***ing screwdriver). You'll probably want to remove the metal line from the rubber one before you remove the clip; easier to get it off that way without twisting something. There's a clip like that on each side of each flexible line. I'd recommend draining brake fluid from bleeder valves first...and keep your eyes out of the way of the brake lines when you open them. Be prepared, also, to eat some dirt in this exercise.

If you don't have to drive the bus, I'd recommend removing the flex lines before you put in your order. If this is your first time doing this, you're very apt to twist a metal line in the process and you'll want to order that too...or go to your FLAPs and buy one.

Take care! Joe

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Your the second person to tell me about the brake lines.  The only flexible
&gt;brake lines, unless I missed something are the fronts.  Is this correct.
