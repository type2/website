&gt; That's a first place to check. It is probably idling fine in gear
&gt; because the AT is slowing it down, but can't be good for the

&gt;  I have an 81 Vanagon with FI and automatic transmission.  It idles
&gt; fine in drive, but when it's warm and I put it in park, it idles too
&gt; high.  As soon as I have it in gear, either drive or reverse, the idle
&gt; is fine.
&gt;
&gt;  I'm thinking the Aux Air Regulator is probably stuck open.  Any opinions?

first with auto tranny the accel linkage needs to be checked.  since it
goes thru the tranny it is adjusted differently than a manual and is
adjusted first.
then adjust idle. remember the auto tranny engine idles about 100rpm
slower than a manual.

do this first before touching anything else. 90% of idle problems in an
auto tranny bus is in the accel linkage.
