Subject: Website &amp; E-Mail is back up

My website has been down since about last Thursday and e-mail access was
sporadic through late Sunday night.  Looks like everything is slowly coming
back up.

The reason for mentioning this is that my site and e-mail boxes are on the
same server as Type 2/Vintage Bus at Azaccess, so when they go down, I go
down as well (and vice-versa).

My apologies to those I haven't received mail yet and to those whom I
replied to through last Sunday haven't received them.  And thanks to those
who did call me to mention they couldn't get to the site or had e-mail
bounce back.

Cheers
