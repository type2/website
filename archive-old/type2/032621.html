Subject: Conversion to Bosch CIS Injection

Hi,
  I am currently in Chile but when I return to the US in March I will be 
building a new engine for my 75 type2[old one dropped a valve,converted it 
to a 3 cylinder on the overpass and drove it home 1100 miles]. My type2 came 
to me with an aftermarket carb and manifold. I was going to re-install the 
stock injection system for various reasons but I &quot;got to thinkin&quot; Why not 
convert the stock Fuel Injection[FI] to a Bosch CIS system from an early VW 
Rabbit[K-Jetronic for you termophiles] The CIS for those who havn't come in 
contact with it is a fully mechanical fuel distribution system. No 
electronics at all! which means that the chance of being left on the road is 
greatly reduced[Keep it simple].
As an added bonus the fuel lines of the CIS system are of the braided 
stainless variety with flare nut fittings which should greatly reduce the 
risk of fire.
  The parts for this swap should be cheap[Rabbits seem to breed better in 
the junkyards] and from what I can recall of both systems several pieces 
from the stock system could be reused[thermo time switch, aux. air regulator 
etc.] while you would replace the Temp sensor, air flow meter and brain] The 
mildly tricky part is mounting the injectors which have to be insulated from 
the engine to prevent vapor lock. Before I get too in depth here I was 
wondering.
  Has anyone tried this? If not would anyone be interested in seeing this 
documented?
  I am a professional Mechanic and a passable photographer and would be 
willing to document this if anyone is interested.
  Thanks for your help,
