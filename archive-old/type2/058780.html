Subject: ROOF - YEAH BABY, YEAH YEAH

well ive been snivelling about my roof for months now - so here is what
ive done
i drove 10 hours to north battleford saskatchawan (sp) and traded a rear
bumper for about the middle 1/3 of a roof including the roof supports
that the roof is welded to
i borrowed a compressor and a welder today from a friend -  a friend of
a friend who happens to be a 20 year body man came over - we seperated
the roof skin from the roof section and kept the roof supports attacted
- drilling out the welds would have meant too many holes in the new
section - we cut the section at just the point were it turns flat into
the roof gutter - the welding in the rain gutter of the new section was
much too eratic - spots and edges etc. - it was almost continuous - and
there were some spot welds in the nominally vertical section and we
drilled those out - i was left with a roof section with brackets
attacted and the horizontal section that goes into the rain gutter
removed and in the edge right above the rain gutter has a series of
holes drilled all along it
we cut the roof section in the middle of my bus from about 1&quot; above the
rain gutter to the internal supports - we removed both internal supports
as they were/are kinked and useless - we put a jack on a block of wood
on the back of the divider behind the front seat and put a block of wood
on the air vent - jacked up the air vent till it was just past where it
should have been - took a hammer and pounded out the buckles on the air
vent on the sides near the handle that opens the vent - we removed the
jack and now the air vent is up where it should be and it is no longer
buckled -  with a big hole in the roof of the bus it became easy to
pound out all the dents in the roof - the piece i removed was seriously
rusted - and streched from the attempted repairs of the previous owner -
he was not a body man but he does know a lot - his attempt was an effort
but really the damage was too much for him/or anyone too fix
we set the new section in and as the supports were still welded on it
took a little manouvering but went in easy enough - we (actually ken the
bodyman) straighted out one of my old roof supports and put it back in
about a foot towards the back of the bus -
tomorrow - well grind down the edges of the hole on the bus - about 1
1/2&quot; in on the top and on all of the vertical section right above the
rain gutter - on the section to be put in we will grind the underside of
the section on the top part - also about 1 1/2&quot; in - well use duramix
4179 - well squeeze it out of the gun and onto the ground section on the
top of the bus - spreading it with a sqeegy (sp) - well do the same on
the roof of the bus again in the ground section and again spreading it -
then well apply more to the top in a bead - well place the section into
the hole again and line up the roof supports on the inside
well use selftapping sheet metal screws about 8&quot; apart all along the
egdes to which duramix has been applied
then well weld all of the spots along the edge just above the rain
gutter - well weld in the roof supports - and well weld in the
additional support that was repaired - well weld in the spots that are
in the tabs on the air vent to the new support
the duramix takes 24-48 hours to dry so ill let that happen - then ill
grind of the screw heads and bevel the edge of the section that was put
in - ill grind down the spot welds - then all use some sort of metal to
metal body filler all along the top edge that was fastend with duramix
and along the roof gutter edge that was welded - ill do my best to hide
the repair - prime and paint the roof
will it be 100% - probably not - but it will be better than 90% -
everyone ive spoken to that has used duramix says it is very good and
doesnt make big section warp
total cost -
bodyman - $20/hr - about $120
duramix gun - $50
duramix - 2 packs - $60
new section - got it for a bumper i paid $50 for
body filler/seam sealer etc.  ?? maybe $30
total about $310.00

estimate to apply a whole roof - first id have to find one and that has
been impossible but labour alone was estimated at $1000 - there are not
just spot welds there - roofs are welded on im many places - more than i
or any of the 3 bodymen ive spoken to have thought - these 3 bodymen are
not hacks - but all have very, very good reputations
sunroof estimate - ?? - thing is do i want a sunroof in canada?? NO -
but estimates ive gotten are all close to $1000 - and the one id need
would be huge - as the roof damage was very, very extensive

a roof repair for everyone? clearly not - but its the repair ive chosen
after months and months of consideration - and im happy - specially
since im gonna put my new roof rack on right over the repair and with
that on - yeah baby, yeah yeah - it'll be soooooooo close to 100%
