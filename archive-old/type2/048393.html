&gt; As far as I know, the sunroof opening on a '70 is the same as the 
&gt; opening
&gt; for a Westfalia pop top camper.  So, pull out the sunroof hardware 
&gt; and put
&gt; on a pop top.  BTW, I just happen to have one.

Same size opening as the EARLY bay-window westy tops.

New London eh? I'm down in Goffstown with my '78 sunroof/camper/1600cc
monster (the sun machine)

Peace
