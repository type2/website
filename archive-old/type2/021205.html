I have Bentley, Muir, Haynes and Chilton.  While looking for info on
swapping hydraulic lifters I found in Chilton an instruction to &quot;bleed&quot;
new lifters which involved disassembling, then reassembling them while
submerged in oil using &quot;half a type1 pushrod and a press&quot;.  Uh, yeh,
lemme just pop into my machine shop in the garage...  (Which I assure
you is there in my hippie bucolic dream, but not in reality.)  Muir said
you could put 'em in dry and after 5-15 minutes of awful noise all will
be well.  I think not.

Hehe.  A little asking around proved that to be unnecessary.  All one
needs to do is marinate 'em in oil.  I don't know if the Chilton
procedure was true then...

ALL the manuals are a bit off in spots.

Perpetually Confused,

Teri
