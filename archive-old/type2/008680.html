&gt; Then I got stopped dead in my tracks on
&gt; that little 30 mm crankshaft pulley nut . breaker bar , cheater pipe ,
&gt; screwdriver jammed in to keep the pulley still , and blocks on every
side to
&gt; help my foot hold the case down ((no engine stand :( )) . I think
the pulley
&gt; will rip apart before that nut loosens even a hair . Have any of you
&gt; encountered this and if so could you tell me what worked for you

With the cylinder off it's a bit more difficult, but I've had good
luck with the following procedure:

Engine sitting on floor or sturdy bench.

Get good socket to fit pulley nut.  It must fit correctly!  Get a long
(12&quot; or longer) extension and a slide-bar to go with the socket.  Put
the whole works together and put the socket on the nut with the
slide-bar horizontal.  Support the drive end of the slide bar with a
block of wood sitting on the floor.

Now, use a heavy rubber mallet or a hammer and a block of wood on the
free end of the slide bar to break the bolt loose.

The reason for using the long extension is to prevent the side loads
of the hammering from being transferred to the crankshaft.  This way,
the support block takes the side loads and only torque is transmitted
to the bolt.  If you have rods hanging out of a short block, you shoud
lock the flywheel in place to prevent their damaging the case by
flailing about.
