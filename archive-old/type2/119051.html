Subject: list failure notices

AARGHH once again I end up just giving up and throwing out a well worded and
topical reply to the list because the mailer daemons rejected it for
excessively quoted text.

Boy is that one getting old! I rarely post to the list but it seems nearly
everytime I've tried to, no matter how little quoted test is included, I
just get it kicked back in my face and end spending/wasting far more time
trying to edit and resend my post then it took to type it up in the first
place. Sometimes they finally go through, othertimes I just give up. Well
I'm giving up, if I ever get around to actually buying a bus of my own and
have new questions to ask I'll post em but this mailer daemon's kicked my
butt for the last time. No more replying to posts for me, unless I asked the
original question. I really don't get it, I see posts to the list nearly
everyday with more quoted material then I use, but whatever....

I'm sure I'm not the only one to give up on a reply in frustration and just
throw it out. It's a shame cause the list really does look to be a great
resource for bus owners, I've got all the posts back to 11/13/2002 (19,471
messages!) and most everything I've learned about buses is off the list. I
probably know more about them then a lot of non-list bus owners! LOL I just
wish that mailer-daemon wasn't such a !$#_at_*^.
