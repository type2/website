Subject: Re: '67 Spindle Thread Size

Baum Tools Unlimited carries the size you need, although i don't know
the specific one you have... also, the threads vary between left-hand
and right-hand, for different side spindles, at least on the early
buses...
Their number is 1-800-848-6657

Here are ALL the dies that they stock for VW:

Metric numbers: (width of stud being threaded) X (pitch of thread)
I think that the pitch is in Threads per Millimeter... you may have to
count 10 threads or something and divide that by the number of
millimeters that they take up to get an accurate figure for the pitch.

5 X 0.8 carb studs $4.40
6 X 1.0 starter armature shaft $4.40
8 X 1.0 rocker arm nuts $4.40
8 X 1.25 muffler studs $4.40
10 X 1.5 case studs $4.40
12 X 1.5 generator armature shaft $4.40
14 X 1.25 spark plug $7.15
16 X 1.5 R stub axle, 1500-1600, right $9.29
16 X 1.5 L stub axle, 1500-1600, left $16.85
18 X 1 R stub axle, 1500 transporter, right $10.77
18 X 1 L stub axle, 1500 transporter, left $20.40
18 X 1.5 L sedan, left $10.77
18 X 1.5 R stub axle, right $20.40
22 X 1.5 R stub axle, old transporter, right $11.89
22 X 1.5 L stub axle, old transporter, left $24.29
24 X 1.5 rear axle, all sedans and old transporter $13.49
30 X 1.5 rear axle, 1500 transporter $18.89

prices are from their catalog, but they may vary....
I have no affiliation with them other than knowing that they carry this
stuff. They also have thread files and restorers, if that would be
easier...

&gt; What is the front spindle thread size for a '67?
&gt; It would be the same size as on '64 through
&gt; the early loafs.  The threads on mine are damaged
&gt; and I would like to run a die over them before
&gt; re-assembling.  I need to call around to buy,
&gt; borrow, or rent such a beast and would like the
&gt; proper size aforehand.  Or at least be assured
&gt; that I get a thread file with the proper size on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Would someone please cross post to the Type2 list,
&gt; thanks.
