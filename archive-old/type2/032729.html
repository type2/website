Which distributor have you got?  If it's an 009, this is the sort of
behaviour you would expect.  If it has vacuum advance, check that your
advance mechanism is working.  Don't touch the carbs until you know
everything else is working.

&gt; when the go
&gt; button is pushed, nearly dies, THEN it takes off! Most frustrating!
&gt; Carbies, perhaps?
