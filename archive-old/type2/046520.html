I use a Fiama F35pro. 8.8ft long by 8ft out. The thing kicks butt. It's 
Godzilla, the Elements are Japan.  Had to slightly modify the front bracket 
to fit on my ' 78 Urban Assault Westy, &quot;Thumper&quot;. Wife loves it. I love it.( 
The only thing we've agreed on in 10+ years and a couple O' tax deductions 
worth of &quot;wedded bliss&quot;...) One person set-up and take-down. Only problem is 
that it was a bit costly. To the tune of almost 650.00 with the custom 
brackets and powder coating to accent the paint job of the Bus. But as they 
say, you get what you pay for.....
