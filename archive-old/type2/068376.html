&lt;&lt;Dear Bob,
 
        I recently purchased a '77 Van with a Scat shift lever in place of the
 stock one. It is a real pain to deal with. How much of the original
 shift mechanism does this after market Scat shifter replace? How can I
 go about putting back the original shifter?
  &gt;&gt;

Jim,

I don't know.  I've no experience with that young a bus.  Perhaps someone on
the list can help you.
