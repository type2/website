Gentlepersons-
                       J.C. Witless has the tool for bending brake lines; but 
again, like Harbor
Freight, quality may be lacking. Try a hot rod specialty shop, if there's one 
near you...
Those guys are a goldmine for these kinds of fabrication/restoration 
tools...Tell 'em
you're building up a Duece with a Alfin brake drums for better service...
