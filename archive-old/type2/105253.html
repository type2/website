&gt; Greetings everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I have yet to find any Aircooled VW Clubs in the Washington, DC Metro area...

how about spreading out to cover the Baltimore/Washington or even
&quot;Cheasapeake&quot; area VW club

we're a bit parochial here in Baltimore and get bent about being in the
shadow of that little town down on the potomac
