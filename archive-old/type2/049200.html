Its not great since you loose so much space!
But it works.. especially if you are on a low budget. If budget is 
not the major issue
then the ONLY wat to go is a new B1C: small easy, a LOT safer and you 
can put it wherever.
That's what I did in my own van and I am very happy.
also takes less battery power since the van is smaller, more 
efficient and has several speed settings.
