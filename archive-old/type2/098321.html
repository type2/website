&gt; I'm sure someone out there has run into this problem. My 81 Vanagon has a

Craig,

On my '80 I had this very problem and found that by greasing the bolt that
runs thru the bushings, it disappeared.  If you do this (and I recommend
it), make sure you take a punch and mark the orientation of the bolt
before you extract it, as it is a major adjustment on the front end.
alsoi make sure you use a torque wrench when you put it back together, as
the torque spec on this nut is quite critical.
