&gt; Just got my first bus ('79 Westy) and boy oh boy am I gonna need some
&gt; advice soon!   

Welcome. Get the green Bentley manual if you haven't already.

&gt; What I've found so far:
&gt; 1.  Low compression #3 (50#)
&gt; 2.  Water coming through rear heater vent.  &quot;Hey, is it supposed to be
&gt; cold in here?&quot; :-)

Under the rear bench or under the fridge (if you have one)?

&gt; 3.  Front axle beam rusted through (didn't see that!) at center pivot
&gt; point.  (just a small hole).
&gt; 4.  Front end loose as a goose.

Steering Damper dead or missing. Replace it to determine state of steering
box.

&gt; 5.  Steering requires a pretty heavy effort, is this normal?

If the tires are properly inflated if will feel heavy until you get up to
taxying speed. ;-) The large steering wheel and lack of power steering fluid
container is a hint that it's normal.
 
&gt; Other than that, it's just fine! :-)
&gt; 
&gt; My main question right now is does anyone know where I can find a new
&gt; axle beam?  I've seen the adjustable ones, I think I want to find a
&gt; stock unit.

New ones are hard to find these days. Last ones I heard of came from Europe
thanks to Bus Depot but they've since been sold. Perhaps a listmember
grabbed one and has it for sale.

&gt; What should I check on the engine before I pull it, or can I do all my
&gt; checking on the bench?

Get a state of the engine before you make changes. Do you have a starter on
a bench setup? Can you deliver fuel and route exhaust? Probably not.

Check compression, idle rpm, dwell, fuel pressure and manifold vacuum. That
way you can see the difference you made after your rebuild and assembly
which will start with a valve adjustment.

The best advice I can give you while the engine is out is to thoroughly go
over the electrical ground system (engine and transmission) and clean all
the contacts. More than one person has taken the engine out put it in and
it's failed to work for mystery reasons.

&gt; Should I convert from FI to carburetor as long as it's working?

This has been said many time: no, that is unless you want to give me the
parts. ;-)
