Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel cut off

&gt;Just offering some advice.
&gt;I have installed a solenoid cut off in the fuel line straight after the tank
&gt;outlet on my bus ('77 2L type 4 dual carb) as well as a fuel pressure gauge.
&gt;What I have noticed when running the pressure is ~3.5psi, but when I turn it
&gt;off the pressure has risen to as high as 12psi. (it takes ~3 to 5min. to
&gt;drop down to zero)
&gt;I'm assuming when turned off, the heat from the motor heats the fuel in the
&gt;line which is locked between the solenoid and the carb needle valve causing
&gt;the high pressure. What this now does is make it MUCH more likely to push a
&gt;hose off, or burst an old line. So just beware. I'm now wondering how to
&gt;relive this pressure!!

What was the source or brand of the solenoid valve. That is on my to do 
list. I have some info saved up but I'm always looking for more.

Thank You!
