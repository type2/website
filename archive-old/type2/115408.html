Subject: [t2]34 Pict and idle

    &quot;I've read/heard that one of the issues w/ the 34 is they seem to get 
clogged up sometimes. All the sudden my 1600 wouldn't idle good at all. I 
suspect a piece of trash or something of the like clogging up something 
somewhere.&quot;


Every time I've had a carb(34 or 30/31) develop an idle problem, it has 
turned out to be crud in the air bleed circuit.  Actually, the air bleed 
jet.  Grab a new one from Motorworks.
