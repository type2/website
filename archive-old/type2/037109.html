Subject: Fuel filler for a 1979 bus?

Whilst at my mechanic last week, I noticed that the 1979 bus in for
service hasn't moved. My mechanic told me that it was destined to become
a 'parts bus' soon, because the part needed was NLA.  (211 201 119 A)

 Here in California, one's bus must pass smog tests. Not only are the
testers concerned with actual emissions, the poor bus must have all of
the original parts intact. The fuel filler flaps are rubber, after 30
years they are cracked and useless.
Without this one rubber piece, the bus cannot ever be driven again in
this state.

Does anybody have a 211 201 119 A ?
