&gt; Forgive me if this subject has been beaten to death, I searched the archives and found discussions but no real answers for this one.  How common are speedos with a reset-able trip odometer for the bay window buses?  I just bought one and it's dated 9/74.

I wonder who has the other one....they are very hard to find
