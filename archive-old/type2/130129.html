Subject: Type 4 rebuild ?

Hello Everyone.
 
After the problems I have had with my engine this summer (Burning oil like
an Iraqi dictator bring one of them.) I have decided to rebuild my engine
this winter.  I was looking at the rebuild kits available at CIP.  My
current engine is a 1976 2.0 with solid lifters.  I'm looking at two kits.
One is more or less a stock rebuild at 1915cc and the other is a stroker kit
that brings the engine up to 2027cc.  I want to run my stock FI system.  It
works perfectly on my current 2.0 (1915cc).  
 
My question is this: What kind of performance increase will I get from the
2027cc Stroker kit with the stock FI system installed?
