Subject: Re: [T2] Weak roof

My '73 Safare has no added reinforcement either.  It looks like the center 
beam was cut out by a drunk guy with a sawzall.  They tacked some trim over 
it so it wouldn't be visible.  The removal of the brace hasn't caused any 
noticeable problems though.  My guess is that the highroof itself, being 
screwed down every six inches or so, provides significant reinforcement.

&gt;My 72 started out as a Sundial/Safare hightop camper that I pulled the top 
&gt;off to install my pesent top that rises on both ends.
&gt;When I removed the old top I was distressed to find that the roof was not 
&gt;reinforced uppon removal of skin and center beam(above rear end of sliding 
&gt;door).
&gt;Has anyone else dissasembled this kind of camper and if so what have you 
&gt;found??
&gt;Wish I hadn't sold my welder!
