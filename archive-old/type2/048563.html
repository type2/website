Hey there,

A great way to access recent messages that haven't made it into the
archive is too use the search function on the type2_dot_com reflector
site:

http://www.type2_dot_com/type2reflect/

Which turned up,

If you can not find them at your local supplier, Performance Products
hasthem under their part number  904089.  2.0 L 914 and 912E
application. www.performanceproducts_dot_com.  I'm not sure of what I
paid last time I bought some at my local parts store, but they want
17.95 each.


Hope this helps,
