Subject: Re: [T2] 2-bbl Webber Progressive - Calibration?

Yeah, my cable is a bit weird. Seems like it was ghetto-ly installed when
I purchased the car. A hole was cut into the rear tin-work and it was
rubbing. I've since put a plastic insert in there to prevent the cable
from rubbing against the tin-work, but I'm going to have to think of a
better alternative in the future.
