Subject: RE: oiling locks

Also don't forget that WD-40 is great for getting thigs freed up, but 
then use some real oil (3-in-one is good) as a lubricant. You want to
use something that will not quickly evaporate the way WD-40 does.


George Lyle is also very on the mark when he says:

The usual culprit for stiff locks isn't the cylinder itself, but the
breakage of a tiny spring on the latch mechinism.  This spring operates
a lever that allows you to lock the door from the inside by holding the
trigger while you close the door.  If the door will lock when you close it
without holding the outside trigger then you need to replace the spring.
For details see the library.


This is especially true for the 1969-1971 front doors.
