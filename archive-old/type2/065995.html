When you buy new brake lines they already have the flared ends and the
connection nut on them.  They come in all different lengths, so you get the
size you need.  Local Flaps should have them.  You can get a brake line
bender cheap at Harbor Freight (about $7 800.423.2567) but it will take
awhile.  You can get it locally, but you may pay alot more.

Hope this helps.
