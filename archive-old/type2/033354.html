HI list,

I posted about a Adventure camper I found, anyway I gave it to my friend and
he has it all cleaned up, new tires, meticulously maintained, ORIGINAL and
COMPLETE, it is some kind of deluxe model with all the goodies.
He will be a POMONA car show this Sunday with the gus for sale.   It is NICE

He will ask somewhere around $3000 for it, he is not sure yet.   It is white
and tall and will be in the vw for sale area, his name is Tim.   Good luck

I hope someone gives it a great home.
