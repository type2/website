Subject: [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

Greetings,

I have a daily (weekday) driver '71 camper that I'm considering restoring.
Many tasks I'm sure can be performed in a weekend, so those won't be an
issue.  However, one that's bugging me as I think through my &quot;plan&quot; is what
about paint?

O.K., O.K., I could take off a Friday and Monday, mask and shoot the
camper.  However, I was hopin' to take the high road and &quot;do it right&quot;.
Right now that means take out all glass, top, lights, etc.  Follow this by
prepping, priming and painting the entire stripped body at once -- interior
and exterior.  Then, put humpty dumpty back together again.

The problem is obviously that I can't do all of this in the span of a few
days -- or can I?  Just lookin' for feedback as to whether this will be
just a can of worms best left unopened, or whether I'll really appreciate
having done it &quot;right&quot;!

For those of you more familiar with painting a vehicle *without* removing
glass, etc. -- what would be the proper steps to do this?  With respect to
glass, I'm guessing that I would first need to remove windshield, etc.,
one-by-one, replacing brittle seals/gaskets first.  Then apply primer/paint
as the last step.  (Maybe this would be an O.K. approach if I sanded/primed
the perimeter of each glass item before installing the new seal/gasket?
Maybe I could even spot paint the area before putting in the new
seal/gasket?  Would it be hard to match color/thickness between the final
coat and what would be sticking out under the new seals/gaskets?)

O.K., I'm rambling now -- just looking for advice on plans that work and
plans that don't.

Maybe I should buy a cheap, but useful, Beetle to drive while I &quot;do it
right&quot;?

TIA and Regards,
David
If I cave in and mask/paint the traditional (and faster) way
