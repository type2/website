Subject: Suggestion (engine setup)

Gentlemen's

I just bought a 79 Delux camper (i sold my 73) and looking for a good 
engine setup.
I will rebuilt the core and put new AMC head with with some slight mod, 
but here in Canada I'm limited for pistons and sleeve, the only thing i 
can get locally is the Brasil one and they are not my first choice.

So, i was looking at aircooled_dot_net  product and they seem to have the 
right stuff, i'm looking for reliability first because i travel a lot, 
and the hard way (800mile non stop per day), a small boost in power 
would be nice, so any suggestion about those pistons &amp; sleeves kit? 
(part #) Aslo, i will change of course the distributor and carbs, any 
comments on the SVDA VS the Mallory and you suggestion about carbs. I 
was running a Single Prog Weber  on my 1800 and was very happy with this 
one but i will now go Dual.

So, any comment and suggestions on that matter would be appreciated.

Regard, Ben (going to Everybus next week...in a vanagon)

ps.: i have my own VW shop so I'm not new to VW, i rebuilt Vanagon 
engine and trany for living... I'm just looking for some suggestion, i 
want to pull my SV1000S motorcycle...
