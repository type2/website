Subject: another newby &amp; fuel converters
Date: Wed, 3 Feb 1999 22:13:48 -0000

Hello,
    to follow in the footsteps of Calibear, I would like to introduce
myself.  I have recently purchased a '72 van.  I'm currently going through
what I guess many of you have done in the past:
    1) stripping out most of the previous guy's work to install my own
    2) pulling dodgy f/glass repair jobs to bit so I can weld a decent job
in

    However on top of all this, I am thinking about the iminent conversion
to unleaded.  It appears themonths are flyig by over here in the UK and once
the hangovers have died down on 1/1/2000 we will have to facethe problem of
only being able to obtain/afford unleaded. I'm sorry if this subject has
already been broached before I arrived, butI would be grateful for ay words
of wisdom.  So far I have heard nothing but praise for the fuel
converter/catalyser- albeit fom the salesmen.  Is this generally frowned
upon as a cheap fix compared to a replacementvalve seat set etc?
      In addition, I have been told I will be needing a new cetre steering
pin.  I ca work out what that is. Is itthe pin assembly thatis the pivotfor
the linkage mounted onto the front axel beam?

                Thanks for your help

                   Tristan and Isolde (the van)
