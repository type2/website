&gt; 
&gt; So: DIY, or Maaco?

BTW, you might have to paint the inside/underside yourself. Since it's 
smaller, and mostly covered with mats, etc, you can do this yourself. 
Talk with your local auto paint dealer about recommended paints. I'd 
probably use an Acrylic Enamel. It dries hard, has a good shine, and 
resists wear. Get a good book on painting (from the library, if you 
wish) to see how to apply it. Also read the cans' labels. A quart of 
paint should paint the interior front, but you might get into 2 quarts 
for the entire inside. Also, paint in sections, with the floor last, if 
you do the back. This way you can apply 2 coats to the walls/ceiling 
panels, then can back out, painting the rest.

It's a lot of work, and most paint shops won't do it (they won't even do 
the inside of a pickup bed, except for a high additional charge... and 
it's simplicity to paint).
