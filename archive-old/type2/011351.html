Subject: 76 camper for sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

this was sent to me from my website.   you now know as
much as me.
&gt; 
&gt; We own a 1976 VW camper. It has 130,000 miles. WE
&gt; are an elderly couple
&gt; and do not use the camper any more. It is excellent
&gt; mechanical and body
&gt; condition. WE live in Corner Brook, Newfoundland. WE
&gt; are anxoius to sell
&gt; and are wondering if you have a network of such
&gt; enthusiasts. If so
&gt; please contact my nephew in Ottawa, Ontario (Chris
&gt; Candow) ph
&gt; 613-825-4197 or this email address (kirao_at_magma_dot_ca)
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you
&gt; Junia and Ernest Langins
