Subject: warranties

The Pertronix electronic ignition warranty is excellent.  During engine
replacement, I managed to reverse the leads from the ig. unit to the
distributor and totally fried the ign. unit.  I called Pertronix with
the hope of obtaining a replacement electronics module (that I expected
to pay for), and the woman I spoke with asked how old the unit was.
When I told her it was ~ 2 months old, she said send it to the company
and they would inspect/test it.  I told her that it was my fault and
that I had reversed the leads etc and she said to send it anyway and to
include a letter describing the problem.  I clearly stated in my letter
to Pertronix that I had failed to reinstall the ign. unit correctly.
Well it didn't matter, they sent me a replacement part FREE and included
a test results sheet!  I have never been so impressed with a company's
warranty policy as Pertronix's and highly recommend their product.  BTW
the electronic ignition is the only way to go - timing stays dead on and
the dwell doesn't vary with RPM as can happen as the distributor wears.
