Subject: Re: [T2] re Bob Hoover's Sermons

Wouldn't it be nice but somehow I doubt it. When Bob parted ways it 
was because he was fed up with criticisms of, attacks on and people 
trying to profit from his intellectual property. As I recall the CDs 
were individually burned (on a Mac) by someone whose initials are Ken 
Hooper. Ron form Bus Depot was kind enough to handle distribution. It 
was done as a labor of love on Ken's part. As for Bob's motivation, I 
can only guess but I suspect his intentions were honorable. The last 
thing I heard from Bob (it has been a few years) was that he wanted 
to publish a book but was stuck trying to find someone to handle the 
technical drawing at a price he could afford since the book would 
most likely be self-published.

I miss Bob's presence on the list as I do some of the other ghosts of 
the past. I will never forget Grendel. I can still picture Bob in the 
junkyard - facing off the dog and rolling down the hill to get the 
reduction gear box. And then there was the Inuvik Run trip reports 
which were eviscerated from the Vanagon website. How long ago was 
that? Times flies and people get jaded quickly on the virtual 
communities of the Internet. At this point I am getting sappy and 
pissed so one last thougt-

Bob, if you are out there, I hope you get your book published I will 
be one of the first to buy it!
