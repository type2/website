&gt; I have some minor problems still to iron out.  My turn signals stopped
&gt; working, but the hazard flashers still work...I'm sure that they share the
&gt; same relay, all I get from the turn signal lever is a steady indicator light
&gt; in the dash (left and right) and nothing from the lights themselves.  Any
&gt; ideas?

If you will go to:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-76.jpg
and look at current tracks 48-56 you will see the wiring diagram for the
turn signals.  There is a connector labelled T3a on this diagram where
current from the turn signal switch meets current from the emergency
flasher switch.  It can be located by following the black/white and
black/gree wires emerging from your steering column.  I would unplug and
replug that connector.  I understand that you have a 1977 and that the
wiring diagram for that year is slightly different
(http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-77-78.jpg)
but the T3a connector is still there and I suspect it.

&gt; Also, does anyone have a picture of the clutch cable routing forward
&gt; by the front axle beam?  While the bus was up on the ramps I noticed that it
&gt; isn't sheathed here forward of the front axle beam where it comes out from
&gt; the pedal and it is rubbing against the frame and a wire harness (not worn
&gt; through it yet).  I'm wondering if something is missing or mis-routed.

There ought to be a black plastic sheath on the cable at that point.  Some
cables do not have the sheath or it may have slid back into the tube.  You
may wish to preemptively replace the cable with one that has the sheath
and save the old one for emergency repairs.  I assure you that you will
need it eventually.

&gt; When running today, I'm now concerned if the engine is running too
&gt; warm.  The tin air flaps are open (the torsion spring holding them
&gt; full open when the thermostat is fully expanded) but it feels awfully
&gt; warm in the engine compartment. My new Cylinder Head Temp gauge is
&gt; indicating about 310 degrees F on the highway at 55 mph, but my new
&gt; VDO oil temp sensor isn't installed yet as the thread of the sensor
&gt; appears to be different from the thread pitch of the plug hole.  The
&gt; oil sump is quite warm to the touch, I'll see if I can mount a
&gt; thermometer somewhere for the time being.

If the sump is merely &quot;quite warm&quot; then you are doing well.  The ideal
temperature for oil is 100-105 with a high limit of 120 (210-220 and 250
in fahrenheit).  The case temperature will be substantially lower than the
oil temperature but if your oil is overheated then the case will burn your
hand.

                             OOK!
