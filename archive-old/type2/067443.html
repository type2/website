Peter, not to be a smart *ss, but GO LOOK! I know some years came with a
support; others didn't. Even if yours did, it might not be hooked up. If it
isn't, you'll want to support your tranny. As I understand it, trannies with
supports don't need additional support.

There are at least 3 good reasons I can think of to support that tranny.
First is, of course, that you don't want to risk damage to it. Secondly,
you'll need that tranny set somewhat parallel to the engine when you put it
back in. Thirdly, if you don't support your tranny, I think you can damage
the CVs, lose tranny fluid, damage your seals, etc.

The VW tranny is pretty light. I've supported it with a cinderblock and
wedged 2x4's. I'm not saying this is the best way. Cinderblocks are brittle
and can break. But, for my needs, this has worked.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;In the Muir book, he suggests that you support your transmission with
&gt;a 2 X 4 and a couple of chains.  The bentley says to use a VW support
&gt;brace.  The Wilson book says to use a jack. (I ordered all these books
&gt;specifically for this engine removal !)
&gt;
&gt;Nevertheless, in the Changes and New Ideas chapter of the 25th anniv.
&gt;ed. of the Muir, a person suggests that no brace is needed to support
&gt;the transmission when pulling the engine.  Is this a possibility?  I
&gt;would rather not have to go buy some chain and lumber and take this
&gt;persons advice, but I would hate to harm my poor bus in any way.
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions?. . . .  Peter Hanowell
