Subject: tap/faucet request from GB
Message-ID: &lt;38209C23.3307_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I lost the e-mail from the guy in Great Britain who was looking for a
faucet assembly for his Devon. I found a faucet in a Safare conversion
at a junkyard. I'm not sure if it's the right one, but it's
different-looking. It's got a sorta big square plastic base with a hand
pump handle. I pulled that and the solendoid-looking thing attached to
the hoses. I don't know if it works, but if it sounds like the right one
I'm willing to send it over.

Nikki
