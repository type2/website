Subject: Re: [T2] Missing damper

Mark in Salem quoth:
&gt;  the
&gt;early buses and bugs didn't have a steering  damper , I want to 
&gt;think that they
&gt;were added about 1958 models.

	My '57 splittie had one  -  like a small telescopic 'shock 
absorber'  -  by '65 it was not working well, as I learned upon 
hitting a rly crossing at an angle inducing a violent loud resonant 
'pneumatic drill' hammering of the steering which went on for a few 
s, somewhat frightening me.
	I'm almost certain that steering damper was original on that '57.
