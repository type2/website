Subject: FS: 3 Westy PopTop Campers in Pa. (LONG)

Any Wannabusers out there?
Once again, I find myself with too many campers in my driveway. The summer 
is ending, and I won't be restoring or working on too many more campers 
until next spring since I don't have a garage.  I'd like to take in a 
couple more &quot;orphans&quot; before the cold weather sets in, but that means I'll 
have to find new homes for these three.  
All of these are late-model layout, which means the large poptop area with 
a 2-person bed up top (plus sofabed down below), swiveling passenger seat, 
sink/icebox cabinetry all on the drivers side (like the Vanagon Westy).

YELLOW 1977 WESTFALIA - $1675.
This bus has a very nice interior - clearly taken care of by the last 
owner, who had it for years and traded it in for a newer Westy.  Cabinetry 
in excellent shape (except table is missing), front seats nearly perfect, 
poptop fabric perfect. Current Pa. inspection. Runs well (needs front 
brakes). This is a local bus and had a couple of rust spots that were 
repaired some time ago. No structural rust (underside, axle, etc. are 
solid), but the left rocker looks as though previously applied Bondo is 
starting to crack. Body is straight. Paint is fair. 

YELLOW 1976 WESTFALIA - $2650
Almost rust-free, originally from California. There's a rust hole in the 
rear apron (behind the rear bumper), and the battery tray, but the rocker 
panels, floors, etc. are completely solid. Interior in very good condition 
(no chips in cabinets, etc.) except for the front seats which are ripped 
under the seatcovers.  Poptop canvas useable but a couple of rips. Small 
dent at one wheel well, and another small one on the nose (hidden by spare 
tire). Crack in windshield near passenger side, does not affect visability 
and should not prevent inspection. Nose was repainted (looks good but not 
perfect), but the rest of the paint is nice. Runs well, needs 2 things that 
I know of - a little play in the steering (don't know why - but not too 
bad), and the fuel pump is loud (but works).  In summary, needs some minor 
stuff but is solid and has a lot to work with.

GREEN 1976 WESTFALIA - $3950
**This is a very, very nice bus!**  From California. Absolutely NO RUST AT 
ALL. Body completely straight, except for a minor scrape/wrinkle at the 
bottom of the sliding door. Paint is nice. Interior nearly perfect. Has 
the deluxe package (stove, fridge, 2 tables, jumpseat/storage box, childs 
cot, etc.). Front seats are reupholstered, but in non-matching material. 
Poptop canvas perfect.  Motor replaced with a '78 (hydraulic lifters, no 
valve adjustments needed), has 150 lbs compression all around (like a new 
motor). 150k on body. Have receipts for all work &amp; maintenance, done by VW 
dealer according to recommended schedule, since new. Only thing it needs is 
a windshield (has crack; useable but may not inspect). Someone should get 
this bus who appreciates it.  


While my wife and I travel cross-country in an '83 Westy, my friend John 
will be at our house during the day. He speaks VW, and can answer any 
questions or handle a sale for me.  E-mail him at my address, or call 
(610) 754-8989. We're in Pa, between Phila. and Allentown.
