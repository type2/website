&gt; Scott:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a nice thick piece of plate glass I use as a flat surface, but I
&gt; wouldn't think lapping the cylinders on the glass would be a good idea; it
&gt; seems to me that the valve grinding paste would serve to also cut the glass,
&gt; destroying the flat surface.
&gt; 
&gt; When I lapped my cylinders recently I used a large piece of crocus cloth
&gt; taped to the flat surface and lapped the cylinders on that.  The Crocus
&gt; cloth is used for very fine metal finishing or precious stone polishing and
&gt; seemed to work well here.

you are right, the glass does get slightly hollowed where you do the
lapping.

i think that when you consider the cylinder is always moving during the
process, the cumulative effect would still be a very flat surface on the
cylinder top, even it was running on a slightly hollow surface. the hollow
is probably 2 or 3 thousandths of an inch over an 8&quot; by 8&quot; area.

all i know is i have taken my engine apart there are no head leaks at all.
every one i've ever seen with the sealing rings in the head has had terrible
leaks.
