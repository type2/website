you've gotten lots of metric advice alread

&gt; any tips on getting these things off or the correct sized hexnut tool would 
&gt; be more than appreciatted.

I bought some metric hex and the TORX sizes that are actually should be on
the replacement that will go on my socket set, and I use my breaker bar to
work em loose

&gt; I did get one tip from someone saying that if it clicks when i turn right, 
&gt; it would be the left rear one thats bad and vise versa, but after looking at 
&gt; them a little more, i know its the right rear making noise when i turn right 
&gt; because i can grab the cv at the transmission and turn it just a little 
&gt; while it is still completely connected, and if i grab the axle and slide it 
&gt; back and forth a hair, it makes noise...

hate to tell you but the movement is normal when jacked up
