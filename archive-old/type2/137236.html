Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Dance - Battery &amp; Ground Contacts Follow-up - 
  LONG

Spoken like a true Canuck Richard, even if you DO live in SoCal. :-) If
there's one thing Canuckleheads know, it's how to winterize batteries and
vehicles. :-) I would even go one step further and get an intelligent
battery trickle charger that charges at about 1 amp but shuts down when it
senses a full charge. I leave one on my motorcycle through the winter months
 but check often, just in case the charger decides to go rogue, and
overcharge.

You need to disconnect the battery when it's not in use for that long. I

would keep the battery inside the garage and put a charger on it the night

before you want to put it back in your bus.
