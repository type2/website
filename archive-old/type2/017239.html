Subject: This makes me so mad!

There was a very nice 70 DeLuxe Bus sitting at a local repair shop.
It was rear ended a bit in the right corner, but otherwise the car was
very nice. No rust, SUNROOF (very rare in Alabama), good and complete
interior, clock, very nice rubber mats, first paint.

It was supposed to be repaired for the &quot;little old lady&quot; owner, not for
sale.
3 month later still not for sale.
1 year later not for sale.

Today I walk over a junkyard and what do I see, the same Bus.
By now dented by the fork lift, drivetrain cut out with a torch. Aaargh!

Well I took out the clock and some small stuff.
If anybody needs a straight rust free front its in Huntsville, AL.
