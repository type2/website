Subject: Seeking a used cold start valve

    I just gave up a good used cold start valve off my 2 litre fuel injected 
motor that will eventually go into my 73 camper.  It went to help a friend 
with their very heavily used bus, and it got it going again, but I didn't 
realize it was an $80 part :-/  I can't afford a new one to replace it, and 
I don't want to stick them for buying me a new replacement for mine when 
they got my used one, but I want to get my motor back together.  Does anyone 
maybe have a good used cold start valve laying around that they can sell me?

Thanks!
