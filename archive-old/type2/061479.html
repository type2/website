I stumbled on Josh's homepage for the first time last week and spent a
couple hours (virtually) enjoying the dunes at Little Sahara with him, &quot;the
wifey&quot; and his buddies. He seemed to have a real joy of life--I in fact
envied his freedom to spend time doing what he really loved to do. Never met
the guy, never dropped him a pmail, but I did benefit from his knowledge
posted to the list, and his enthusiasm. Seems like we're slowly but surely
losing a lot of good people from the list.
Thanks Josh,
Bob
