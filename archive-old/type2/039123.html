Not &quot;mechanic's folklore&quot;, but by Neadeerers specification. The
incredibably ausgezeitnet Porsche syncro design of the 60's and licensed
and used probably even to this day in some applications is based upon
syncro rings that have a moly surface with a specific coefficient of
friction to mate with the particular metalurgy of the dog teeth. Typically,
GL-5 fluid is TOO SLICK, and will glaze this matte surface and turn your
tranny into a &quot;clash box&quot; in no time. The dog teeth must grab the syncro
ring in a few revolutions for butter smooth shifts. If the teeth slip too
much, it will polish the ring smooth in short order and no more grab pertty
danged soon.

This was noted soon after GL-5 was introduced. Even the Porsche factory
race teams probably tried it and burned up a 'copla trannies in practice
proving it unsuitable. Factory never did and still does not approve GL-5
for this syncro design. 

I use Valvoline 85-90wt GL-3,4 in a 5 gal. pail. It is no longer a stocking
item at most FLAPS, but available on special order. It meets spec, is
reasonably priced and is perfectly suitable for the purpose of street use
in temperate climates.
