Subject: re: [T2] Stuck Lugs on the left rear of a 72

I agree EXCEPT get a 3/4 breaker. You may not find a 3/4&quot; socket (i dont
remember is it 19mm?) that size but I use a 3/4 to 1/2&quot; adaptor and a 1/2&quot;
socket. You can jump on a 3/4 breaker and it wont bend. I paid 6$ for mine
at a pawn shop. If you spend real money I concur with the lifetime
guarantee being good.




&gt; For Guaranteed Results: Heat the nut with a torch. Then get an impact socket
&gt; set in a 1/2&quot; breaker bar with a 6' pipe extension. Either the nut comes off
&gt; or the stud will shear.
&gt;
&gt; Use a breaker bar from Craftsman or Snap-on that has a lifetime guarantee; I
&gt; have seen a 1/2&quot; breaker bar shear when removing an axel nut but I wouldn't
&gt; expect it with a lugnut. But you never know...
etc.
