I have a Devon conversion with what I think is an ideal arrangement.  It's
very common in the UK on late bay buses.  The stove complete with its
cabinet and gas bottle is mounted behind the front passenger seat on a heavy
duty hinge.  You can lock it in position either inside (facing the rear) or
sticking out the sliding door.  The height is then ideal for cooking either
outside or in the awning.  If you press on a spring lever on the hinge the
whole assembly can be lifted out and put where you like.  There is even a
folding wind/splash shield as well.
