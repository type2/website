Subject: Re: [T2] '78 engine carrier

&gt;someone else on the list tell me if I am wrong but I think the answer is no!
&gt;I think I remember trying this - I had painted the carrier and it was not 
&gt;dry yet so on went the exhaust and in went the engine and .....
&gt;Later when I tried to slip the engine carrier between the exhaust - No go.
&gt;
&gt;So I guess you could put the engine back in sans carrier and exhaust and 
&gt;then install the carrier and exhaust in *that* order.

I believe you are correct. I did install it afterwards but it required the 
exhaust to be off, if not the fan shroud.
