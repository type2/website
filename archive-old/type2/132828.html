And if you go to microsoft_dot_com and read about WindowsXP service pack 2 you
will only (easily) find all the reasons it's a good idea to get it now. 

Only with careful digging elsewhere will you find the 2 page list of
software that will probably stop working as soon as you load SP2, all of
the hoops you'll have to jump through to get some others working, and MS
statements that many programs will have to be updated by their
manufacturers to work properly under SP2. So, if you run a lot of software
be prepared to spend big bucks to get the new &quot;upgrade versions&quot; of it all.

The point is, you're reading the FRAM BOX. Of course they'll say their own
product is the best. Crank up the VCR and video tape several automobile
commercials of different manufactures so you can watch them all back to
back. Every one says their models runs better, lasts longer, and has more
safety features than all the others. It's called advertising.

Read through the links that a couple of the others posted. Some people went
to a lot of trouble to actually cut a bunch of filters open and figure out
how well they were REALLY made.
