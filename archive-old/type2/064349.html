Subject: clutch problems

Hiya everyone

        I have a 71 bus and when i am changing gears the clutch grabs or
whatever and vibrates the car. Does anyone know what is causeing this. I
have heard it could be the flywheel a pressure plate or worn clutch. Is
there any way to test it and know for sure.

Thanx
