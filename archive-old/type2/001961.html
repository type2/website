Subject: air cleaner (custom)

That question about the homemade air cleaner reminded me of a project on my
backburner:  I'd like to convert the oil bath air cleaner on my 71 Westy to
use a paper filter.  I figure I can find a cylinder filter that I can fit
inside the can, with no outside changes.  I'd like to keep the outside of
the filter assembly stock, but never have to mess with the oil again.  Does
anyone know of an off the shelf filter that will work?  Or any reason why I
shouldn't?  Thanks much.

Nice to have the list back, eh?
