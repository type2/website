&gt; got the heads off the 76 engine today to see why this baby was parked 10(?) years ago. bad news. #3 exhaust valve broke at the valve stem and the business end of the valve did unspeakable damage to the head &amp; piston. Also, the back (inside) of the piston cracked and some small pieces are likely in the case.

I did this same thing to my type 4 engine some years ago.


I picked up a used piston/cyl/head and put em in without spliting the
case,,,,  ran for another year or so until I could do a real rebuild.

it isn't the fix only a patch

but sometimes it can work for a while

&gt; should all cylinders/pistons be replaced?

best way
&gt; 
&gt; should both heads be replaced if I do one, and is used okay?

if the other one is ok it shouldn't be necessary
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 10 minutes from CB perfomance. Should I have them split this case to inspect cam/crank/innerds? Anyone ever used them for this with a t4?

don't know em
&gt; 
&gt; this engine had a factory(?) a/c compressor mounted to it which I will not reuse. makes &quot;air&quot; noises when you spin the drive pulley, so I assume it functions. what would it's value be and if anyone's interested, let me know.

$1.25 scrap value
