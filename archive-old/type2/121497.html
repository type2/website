Subject: Re: [T2] To New York- Mid Trip Update

&gt;I took a 2002 Crown Vic through those roads and I must say, I don't know if a
&gt;Transporter can handle those mountain roads

Heck I've towed a Beetle with my Type2 on roads like that. The Type 2 can 
handle it..

Just take it slow with a light foot, shift down early.
