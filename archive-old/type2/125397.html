Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Platinum

I went with Platinum's a little over a year ago in my '73 Bus, just to 
see if it made any difference whatsoever, for about  6 hours, she ran 
like complete crap, less power and hotter than usual, so I pulled them 
out and put in NGKs like I have always run and she was back to running 
like a top. Fortunately no damage in the long run.

An experiment that I could have really done without.&lt;grin&gt;

Steve




&gt; Soooo... Do we, as bus owners who have to do real work on a regular
&gt; basis, really need to skip the annual plug replacement?
