Subject: I found a westy propane tank

        Well I spent a part of this weekend looking for a propan tank and a
set of wheels for my winter tires.  I found them for $150.  The only catch
is that I have to haul away the 74 westy that they are attached to.  This
thing is only about two miles from my house so this should be pretty easy
(tow rope will do for that distance (I hope it has brakes, I forgot to
check)).

       &quot;This year will go down in history.
        For the first time a civilized 
        nation has full gun registration!
        Our streets will be safer,
        our police more efficient,
        and the world will follow
        our lead into the future!&quot;
