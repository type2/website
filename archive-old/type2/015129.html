	Hi all,

Got my rebuilt 1776cc upright engine installed and tested last weekend.
Everything seems to work perfect, got smooth power and the oil seems to
stay cool and inside the engine :-) During the years I have put different
engines together but none of them has worked this perfect from first start.
It started at first try, runs great and has lots of power. 

Now over to the engine I pulled out. It's a mishmash of old engine parts. I
put it together from parts left over from earlier engine restorations. It
has 88mm cylinders(the thin walled &quot;drop in&quot; cylinders), single port heads,
dual weber single port carbs from two F**t 127's, a Marelli mech advance
distributor from an unknown donator and one chromed valve cover;-). 

This sure sounds like a nightmare engine but it works perfectly! This is
why I want to keep it in case I need it later. I know how to store an
engine in a car, but this one will live on my garage floor for an unknown
amount of time. My plan is to squirt some sticky oil into the cylinders
(chaisaw oil) and turn it now and then with a wrench. Fresh oil in the pan
and cover it up with some old sheets. Is there anything else I could do so
this engine is ready for action whenever I need it?
