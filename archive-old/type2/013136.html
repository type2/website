Subject: wiring diagram for these lights ?

I have a set of Bosch lights, one is a high powered driving light and the
other is a wide beam fog light.
Has anybody got the wiring diagram for these lights ?
I have the OEM VW Dash switch that goes in the instrument cluster. The
switch has two positions like the headlight switch has for park light and
headlights.
I've got the lights working but I know that the repay is not correctly
wired because both lights come on.
The proper wiring will give me one fog light in center position on the
switch and high power driving light in the full on position.
The relay has numbered terminals but the switch does not.
Very confusing. I've blown about a half dozen fuses trying various
hookups and have stopped because I don't want to blow out this rare and
probably expensive switch.
I can't go by color codes because this was added to the original vehicle
after delivery, i just put it in the same way it came out since the
colors of the wires don't correspond with any schematics I have.
