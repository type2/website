&gt; All the Load range C/D tires I'm finding on http://www.tirerack_dot_com are all
&gt; &quot;summer rib&quot; so am I better off buying all season tires then buying C/D
&gt; tires in the spring??

NO!  search for the C/D all season tires, they are out there. the
passenger tires cannot handle the weight, and a sidewall blowout at
highway speeds can be deadly.  (I was lucky when it happened to me)

&gt; In the search for a job I find my self in a situation where I'll be driving
&gt; 150+ miles at the beginning off the week, staying with a fellow list member
&gt; (thanks Eric) and then 150+ miles at the end of each week to get home to see
&gt; my wife. At a minimum this situation will exist till at least December. .
&gt;
&gt; I won't be running &quot;fully loaded&quot;, but snow/winter driving is a concern....

get snow/winter tires, go up to 195 or even 205 to get em.  I have
205R70-14 tires on mine, all season radials and they do handle quite well
on snow (I ski)   mine are Michelins, not cheap.
