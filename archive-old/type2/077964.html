&gt; Hi All -
&gt; As many of us do, I keep a Jerry can full of extra gas on board my bus -
&gt; strapped to the roof up in the front luggage area, to be exact.  The Jerry
&gt; can is one of those standard red plastic types, and is approximately 3 years
&gt; old.  Yesterday I took it down because I needed some gas, and noticed that
&gt; the outside of the can seemed deteriorated: the red color seems to now be
&gt; fading and morphing into an orangish color in many places, and there was
&gt; also what looked like bubbling on the surface.  Just thinking it was fading
&gt; from age, I opened it up and pulled out the long nozzle that, when not in
&gt; use, hangs into the gas on the inside.  Looking at the plastic
&gt; accordion-like nozzle, it had a reddish-orange tint to it (i.e. same color
&gt; as inside of the can?).  I wiped a portion it with my finger, and it came
&gt; off to reveal the normal white color of the nozzle.  This leads me to
&gt; believe that there is red coloration from the Jerry can in the gas itself,
&gt; and it is caused this apparent discoloration.  Therefore, my question is
&gt; this:  Is this gas still OK to pour in &amp; use in my engine?  I don't know,
&gt; but it just seems like this coloration substance is not something that would
&gt; be filtered out and subsequently would not be good running through my
&gt; engine.  What do you think???  Thanks for your help!

The red coloration on your nozzle is more likely from the fuel itself.
You can still use the fuel, but I'd mix it with a tank of fresh fuel.

You should not let gas sit for too long in the can.  I keep a 1-gallon can
in my bus and use it to fuel my lawn mower and generator when they need
it.  When the can gets half empty, I pour the rest into the tank and fill
it with fresh gas when I fill the bus up.

Plastic cans will not last indefinitely in the sun.  About 2 years will
produce noticable deterioration and fading in the plastic and at that
point the can should be replaced.

OTOH, I have a can that I use for waste oil that sits in the sun every day
and despite fading over 5+ years is still structurally sound.  I wouldn't
use it for gasoline, though!
