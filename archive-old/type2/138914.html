&gt; Here is one for sale on the Samba:

&gt; Since it is being sold a shop, I assume it is good = www.type4parts_dot_com ??
&gt; Maybe the reddish tint in the pic means the temp is above 180 degrees......
&gt; &lt;ha ha ha&gt;

That one looks expanded to me. I picked up a new unit a few days ago just to
make the system 100% functional.

&gt; Are you sure that is an 1800?  Have you measured the pistons?
&gt; Just about every real 1800 I have seen has had flat-top pistons [bus and 412]
&gt; or domed pistons [914]. The
&gt; dished pistons are 2.0L. Measure the bore and see if it isn't 94mm.
&gt; What is the casting # on that door stop cylinder head?

It's a 1700cc from 72. The heads are both VW and stamped 021 101 371J with
39x33 valves.

&gt; The 1800 bus pistons I have seen have all had a dish.  Granted it's a much
&gt; shallower dish than the 2L pistons, but still there.  The pistons in the
&gt; picture look like what I'm familiar with, which admittedly is Cofap brand
&gt; (non-original).

The pistons are factory orignal: 90mm with VW and Mahle logos and a slightly
dished top.
