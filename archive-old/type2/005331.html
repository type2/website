 Hi Mike,
I successfully installed grase nipples in my ball joints. I just bought them
at the FLAPS, along with a 6mm tap, to tap the threads. Now you need a stub
tap, not a taper tap, as the ball is right behind the piece of metal you are
drilling and tapping.
Of course the local hardware stores only had taper taps.
(Funny story....I walked into one store and said I want a tap this big,
holding up the 6mm thread of the nipple. The mentally challenged hardware
guy said &quot;You want a TAP THAT BIG?????&quot;
&quot;No, no, not a tap you turn on to get water, a tap to make a thread.&quot;
&quot;Ohh&quot;, he replied.
Anyway, sorry I digressed, but after getting home with a taper tap, I got
out the cold chisel and cut the end off just leaving a tiny bit of taper to
start the thread. I had to touch it up on the grinding wheel, and it worked
a treat. The rest of the job was easy. And the nipples worked fine. As I
screwed them in , I put a tiny bit of araldite on the thread just to make
sure they'd stay.
Also, don't try to stick a hypodermic needle through the rubber boots to
inject grease that way. It stuffs up the boots, and doesn't work anyway. The
grease is nowhere near the working surfaces.

&gt;
&gt; I'm replacing the ball joints on my '71 bus and the new replacement ball
joints do not have the threaded hole in the top, which the original joints
have, that allows one to install a grease fitting and re-lube the joint
periodically.
&gt; I was wondering, has anyone attempted to drill and tap these new
&quot;unserviceable&quot; joints to allow a grease (zerk) fitting to be installed?  If
so, please fill me in on the details, e.g., success of job, difficulty and
tools required.
&gt; -Mike
