&gt;Hi
&gt;    We just got our 76 bus and need to do some work but know nothing
&gt;about anything. I saw the question about new vs old parts and was
&gt;wondering the same thing. Are the new parts no good or just more
&gt;expensive? Also what would be the best book  or resource to get if you
&gt;are just starting out?

Nisha:

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Get Muir's &quot;How to Keep Your
Volkswagen Alive&quot; for basic know-how and its warm humanizing can-do effect
on your spirit. Also, get the Bentley manual for the nuts and bolts
procedures specific to your bus. Along with this List, IMHO, these are the
best basic resources for you.

Next I plan to get the Wilson book about rebuilding your engine (I've heard
a lot of good things about that one) because I just got a 69 project, sans
engine and tranny, and I can't spend a lot of money on this thang, so it's
time to learn how to rebuild.

Curiosity, willingness, asking a lot of questions here, and knowing when to
call in the pros are your best attributes for learning how to work on your
own VW, I've found. That, and a separate daily driver. ;-)

And take heart -- my first valve adjustment took 3.5 hours. LOL Everybody
starts somewhere. :-)
