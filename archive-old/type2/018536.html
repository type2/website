Subject: so...its alive eh?
Message-ID: &lt;37682969.55747AD0_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

&quot;So....its alive eh?&quot; is what my neighbor just said to me after firing
up ol' Stella!  Some yelled...some cried (me in joy!) but it was all in
fun....

The hot wire was not hooked up before properly so she didn't
fire....being the unreluctant German I am I tried it again....
VVRRROOOOMM!!

with no muffler she was running loud and merrily!  so relieved to get
her stress out....you were right Harmon...the more you tickle her
insides...the more she moans!

then I took off the hot wire and she stayed running....so it is
something in my ignition switch I believe... since it stays
running...but won't fire up using JUST the key....I have to use a hot
wire...
like I said... anyone have a spare ignition switch lying around??  35
bucks is a bit for me to swing for a new one since I've yet to register
her, put a muffler on her...and new tires..... good karma to all who
offer! while I'm at it .... good busma!

well in all my glee I'm going to go and run around the block 50 times or
so...then sit and enjoy my accomplishments...

oh yeah...and to put in a condenser...I used a razor blade and a grinder
( to shear off plastic and to grind the metal bump down so I could screw
it in) and to set the gap in the points... I used my eyes and a
screwdriver to tighten it...  I think its the German blood running
through us!
I even adjusted the timing on her myself! I'm so damn proud...
now just to fix the shift assembly.... might as well do it now... I have
the day off...

Thanks to all who helped and who will be helping!  I couldn't have done
it without you guys! well...maybe...but not in 2 days!
