    Well, made it back down to Mobile. Much easier trip than going up to
WI. I took off the 225/75R15's on the back and got some 215/70R15's
instead. That gave me a good bit more power, and I was able to cruise at
70-75 most of the way, and the mountains in Kentucky and Tenn weren't
bad at all. Still, I think my next set of tires would be 225/60R15 all
the way around. 
    The tires I replaced the Yohohama 370G's with were Fleet-Farm tires.
I had decided to buy Michelin RainForce MX4's, even made the
appointment. Then I was in FleetFarm, and noticed what looked like
exactly the same tire on sale for only $50, compared to the Michelin $84
price. I asked, and the girl there said they were made by Firestone, but
then I overheard another clerk telling someone that another tire was
made for them by Bridgstone, so I'm thinking that these are probably
Michelin MX4's made w/Duralon labels. Seems like all the big tire
companies have special deals for places like that. I had been trying to
find some Yokohama Resolve GT tires like I have on the front for the
rear - I bought those at Sears. None of the Yokohama dealers I talked to
in WI even could find a listing for any such name. Then one of them told
me that Sears gets special &quot;models&quot; from Yokohama, Bridgestone,
Michelin, etc. 
     Finally solved my stud problem for my Mecedes alloy rims by putting
in 12mm studs and the shanked lug nuts made for alloys. Couldn't find
any such shanked lug nuts for the stock 14mm studs. A real major PITA,
the whole thing. I went to so many FLAPS it was ridiculous. There's
something wrong with their measurement system for the splined part of
the wheel studs. Take the stock '73 stud (and front and back are
different, BTW) and measure the &quot;knurl&quot; or splined part with a
micrometer. It's about 14.84mm -- get a new stud with that measurement
(in the book, I mean), falls right out. Get a 15mm stud, falls right
out. Totally weird. And nobody seems to have a large enough number of
any one stud -- 3 of these, 5 of these, etc., so you have to order them,
only to find they aren't the actual measurement the book says. So I
ended up with a hodge-podge of different studs. Some are welded in.
Major PITA, as I said. I was really wishing I had never started on the
project.
     Oh, also, the Mecedes rims are for 12mm, but they use *bolts* like
the older buses do, not studs. But there are steel inserts in the rim
holes, you can just punch those out, and then the shanked 12mm lug nuts
fit. Seems to work, after 1120 miles none came loose.
