Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb synchro tools

I purchased 2 of these (do both at the same time, I thought):

ACC-C10-7115 - UNIVERSAL CARBURETOR SYNCHRONIZER TOOL ( ECONOMY MODEL )

Cannot remember from whom, but it is a complete piece of junk.  I am 
not sure if it ever really helped me.

&gt; Hi all...being new to the &quot;dual carb crowd&quot; I would like opinions on 
&gt; the &quot;best&quot; type of carb synchronization tool.  I've found 2 types on 
&gt; CIP1 at ....  http://www2.cip1_dot_com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1809   and 
&gt; would like to know if anyone has a preference for either type.
