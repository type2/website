&gt;Just a thought - has anyone thought of posting gif/jpg of wiring 
&gt;diagrams for the various years and models of VW's? This would be a 
&gt;great addition to a VW web page!

Yes, the PO of my '60 truck had made several wiring alterations; 
starter relay, dashboard ammeter, trailer towing wiring etc. and as 
found, the key switch was dangling by it's wires.  'Had to hot wire the 
truck to get it running.  Discovered that it had a 12 volt battery but 
many of the light bulbs still 6v but burned out.  The Haynes and Muir 
diagrams helped but the schematics of the ignition and lighting 
switches made no sense at all. 
I spent two full days with a test lamp and pencil and paper tracing 
every wire by color and stripe (some had spiral stripes others had 
dashed stripes) plus many had splices with different color wire. I drew 
everything on paper including big pictures of the light switch and fuse 
block.
Finally I made four large sketches with the fuse block centered on the 
page. One page is lighting only, another is ignition/start, one for 
battery/generator and finally one for wipers/radio/turn signal-brake 
lights.  It now makes sense.
I'm willing, when I get a round-two-wit, to clean up the sketches, scan 
and make the drawings available.  Just give me the git-go.
