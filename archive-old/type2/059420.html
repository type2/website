Subject: short location procedure

Start by attaching a heavy duty ammeter in place of the fuse.
Turn the key on for just an instant and measure the current draw.
Start unplugging stuff until the draw drops to a normal level.
The last item you disconnected is the short.
Note:  the ignition circuit (to the coil) is not normally fused.
Someone may have changed the wiring and it's not a bad idea to fuse this
circuit but VW didn't.
goforit!
