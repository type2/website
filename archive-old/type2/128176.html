WTF! I just got home a while ago after fighting my way through WallyWorld 
to get some last minute items for daughters Birthday Party tomorrow. Fight 
through leftover Ivan weather traffic. Get home and there it is the last of 
the parts came in that I needed to continue the rebuild on a friends bus. 
New Pistons and Cyllinders 
woohoo!.........................................................wait a 
minute the box looks all f%#$*&amp; up. Open it up and find every single 
cyllinder has some busted fins on them. GD it, MF it, ............where's my 
smoke. It is coming out of my ears. Venting.
