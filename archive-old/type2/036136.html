Subject: RE:  cross-drilled brake rotors

&gt;second-has anyone cross-rilled their rotors, or is there a place to 
&gt;get vented rotors??  or what kind of shop should i look for to get 
&gt;this done(cross-drilling) to the rotors i have. i would rather it be a 
&gt;stock size replacement part.  not like putting discs on a bug, 
&gt;where the spindles and all need to be replaced. 

Cross-drilling your rotors won't give you any better braking.  The idea with
cross-drilled rotors is to provide ventilation to the otherwise solid disc
to let heat dissipate faster.  If you put really big brakes on a race car
and use them frequently and repeatedly from high speeds with really fat,
sticky (racing) tires, they get too hot and will cook the pads so they need
the added cooling.  The price they pay is that the more rapid cooling causes
the rotors to warp much faster than nice solid discs do.

Bottom line on brakes is that if you have the ability to lock up all 4 tires
then you've got as much brakes as your vehicle/tires can handle.  Now,
obviously, you don't want to lock the tires since this will actually achieve
a longer braking distance then if you can be just on the rolling-side of
lockup.  ABS systems found on most newer cars can provide slightly shorter
stopping distances than the same car without ABS because they monitor each
individual wheel for lockup and, if lockup is sensed, they reduce the
braking to that particular wheel.  While you, in your bus, are limited by
modulating the brake pedal to keep the most-likely-to-lockup tire from
locking which probably means that the other 3 are slightly less than at the
optimum braking point.

Buses are heavy vehicles and are often shod with poor or mismatched tires
and almost always have a relatively narrow tire on them.  Obviously the more
rubber you have in contact with the pavement, the better you can brake.  And
the type of tire makes a big difference as well.  High performance cars
usually run a really soft-rubber tire with a wear factor being something
like 160 - 220 (or maybe even lower in extreme cases).  This means the
rubber is really soft and sticky and it also means that those $150/each
tires only last 10k - 20k miles.  A lot of buses are running around on tires
with a tread wear rating of 350, 400, I've even seen some with a 480 on
them.  They'll last forever, but they're not very sticky.

So in conclusion, if you can lock all 4 tires in your bus then your brakes
are doing as good a job as they possibly can.  If you need shorter stopping
distances and your braking system is working properly then bigger, stickier
tires are your best bet.  And never discount the human factor!  If you can
see a potential accident coming sooner (by being able to look over most
other cars on the road), then you've got the best edge you can get right
there.
