Subject: Steering Box Replacement

Many thanks to those who responded to my query.  This list has helped
me out quite a few times now.
  I found a pitman arm puller at Pep Boys ($29.99) which fit perfectly. 
I cinched it up real tight and whacked it twice with a log splitter --
off! I installed the replacement and wow!, what a improvement.  I was
careful to correctly align the pitman arm on the steering box shaft and
the steering wheel shaft coupler only goes on one way, but my steering
wheel now has spokes at 11 and 5 o'clock when tracking straight.  Before
installing the pitman arm (and after attaching the steering wheel shaft)
I turned the steering wheel lock-to-lock and each extreme was a mirror
of the other, so I assumed the steering wheel was positioned correctly
relative to the box.  Now I'm not sure what to adjust in order to center
the wheel: the drag link, the tie rods or the steering wheel at the top
of the shaft.  Any ideas?

Thanks again, DC
