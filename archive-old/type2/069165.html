Subject: oil changes, vanagon

How often?  I say 5,000 miles is reasonable (a modern Toyota
supposedly needs oil change at 7,000 miles or so) but it seems some
believe every 1,500 or so is necessary or the engine will be at risk,
even with modern oils. Is German iron that different from Japanese? 
What's reasonable?  Cheers...
