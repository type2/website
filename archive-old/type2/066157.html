Subject: John Muir Biography?

Does anyone know anything about John Muir, besides what is written in his
book?  I really enjoy reading his manual and would be like to find out
more about him, his background, how he got into all the VW stuff?  Maybe
someone out there has some first hand knowledge?  
Of course maybe it is better if he remains a mystery?
Just Curious,
Brett
