&gt;Okay, what about all of us poor slobs with progressive &gt;setups? 

The manifold for the progressive is usually pre-drilled and tapped for a 1/2&quot; vacuum port right at the base:

O_O
 _-&gt;  &lt;-- vac port
O O

 Mine has the port cast into the manifold - sticks off the thing about an inch.

As far as running a vac dizzy, you can try to pull the vac off the nipple on the carb, but the list says that the single carb doesn't pull enough vac to actuate the assembly correctly.
I think that's what they say anyway...
