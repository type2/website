The best advice I can give in this area is to go look at a lot of camper
Buses, Westys, Sundials, Safares,Dorms, and any others you can find. Compare
the interiors of all of these. Look at different years, talk to the owners
and see what they like, and do not like about there camper. If you find one
that is what you want, take a roll of picture, and some measurments,
drawings and whatever to take back with you. Then, draw your own plans. Many
of the common things, sinks, door handles,ice boxes, stoves, can be had at a
local RV supplier. You will want to incorporate them into the design as
needed. One mans plans will be what he likes, but may not work for you and
your passengers. I know that if there are listees in your area, they would
love to show off their campers, look them up and ask around. You may also
want to look at a few non-VW based camper to get ideas. 
  After all this, you may decide to just go buy a used parts camper and swap
the interiors, but at least then you will know what you want.

Subject: [T2] Plans for Camper Conversion


I posted this question before but only got recommendations for buying
something or how to put a shell on the top so here it is again: I have a
a 70 transporter and would like to build some cabinets, sink, fridge
etc. and maybe some other modifications to use it as a camper: I saw a
site a few months ago, (at first it looked like a parts place, but then
went into detail on how to build cabinets and etc.) but now I can't find
it. anyone heard of this site or any site where I could find plans?
Thank you guys so much

Dok
