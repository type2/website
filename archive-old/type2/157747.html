&gt; what causes points to burn?

gap correct?

regardless, get yourself a compufire and don't worry about points any 
more. You'll probably save yourself a lot of time, aggravation, and 
money... in addition to never having to readjust your timing. It just 
stays where it's supposed to...

hey mike yeah gap is correct i am using a feeler gauge to check it and then crank and check dwell with multi meter(8cylinder) i get it on 22-23 and then let it go from there... and check it after driving a few miles and the dwell is changing along with timing each time. i reset them again with either same points or with a new set each time to check them again and again to find them burning up way to fast...
   
  i have thought about the electronic system instead of points but would still at least keep a set of points in the bus just in case....
   
  i though dont understand why my points are burning and before i make that jump i really want to nip this problem in the bud.
   
  if i can get this fixed i am thinking very serious about the electronic path..
  i have a friend in marion that is very pleased with his...
   
  I do Hate messing with Points... exspecially as much as i have been having to mess with mine lately... constant aggrivation.... and now its getting hot i got to keep that engine cooler.. running out of time every time i turn around is gonna get her hot faster for sure...
