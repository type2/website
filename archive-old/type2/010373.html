&gt; By the way, if your pedastal pads are in bad shape, Wolfsburg West,
&gt; www.woflsburgwest_dot_com,  sells replacement pads that fit great for about
&gt; $30.00 for both sides.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Phil

This is just one of the minor 'over the years' changes i've noticed in the
late bays (number of mounting holes for dash-to-body is another one):

My 75 westy (235) has padding under the stuff covers the seat pedastals (i
call it Tolex cause it looks similar to the stuff Fender used to cover their
black and silver-face amps) and my 74 Kombi (224) has none - just Tolex on
bare metal.

Hmmm.

hearin' my head rattle,

clark in ky.
