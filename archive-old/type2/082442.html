Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Light

&gt; Help,
&gt; My battery on my 76 went flat so I charged it. Now the=20
&gt; battery light is on
&gt; before the ignition key is turned and when the ignition is=20
&gt; turned to on the
&gt; battery light goes out and the oil light comes on.
&gt; Needless to say it does not turn over.
&gt; Any suggestions as to what is wrong.
&gt; thanks
&gt; Jeff


Did you disconnect the battery before you charged it?  If so, is
there anyway possible that you could have reversed the cables
when reconnecting the battery? =20

While I hate to admit it, I have done exactly that and got similar
results as you.  The PO of my 79 had installed a 1700 with a single=20
weber carb.  The engine had some problems and had not ran in awhile
and the battery had been removed before I took ownwership. At some
point the PO had replaced the ground strap with a RED cable, and
the + cable was black, sooo, I put in the new battery, turned the key, =
no-go,
then I smelled the smoke coming from the engine compartment and real =
quickly
realized what I had done.  Still not sure if I fried that alt but
the light stayed on after I switched the cables and fired her up.  =
Shortly
thereafter I removed the engine and replaced it with an FI engine from a =
78.

Any opinions as to whether I could have fried that alt?
