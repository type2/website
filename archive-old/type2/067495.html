Subject: Splittie Year ?

Hi,
 I spotted a Splittie for sale but couldnt stop since I was already late =
for an appointment.... (don't see many splitties in south Florida) ..

anyways my question.. what year has only 2 windows on the passenger side =
(in the cargo doors) and both were jaulosy windows..
It had the large round turn signals...

I will go back tomorrow and see if it is still there... Kinda doubt it.

Thanks..
