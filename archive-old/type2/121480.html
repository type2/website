Subject: Re: [T2] Weatherstrip problems

Hiya Phil,

I got mine through West Coast Metric.  Fits like the proverbial glove.  Kinda spendy though.  And some other stuff I've ordered from WCM has been less than impressive.
I would suggest that you contact Ron Salmon over at the Bus depot for ANY information concerning seals.  He knows all there is to know about the subject and will steer you in the right direction.

Mike
