I am helping to get a friends '78 non-FI Westfalia going again and the engine is a horror pit of sludge and oil--&gt; what I want to know is, what is the best way to get it cleaned up a bit.  I fear the coin-op engine wash because the engine is all sealed (w/o alot of drainage).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
