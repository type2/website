That does seem a bit high, as each 10dB represents 10X the sound
energy. A jet engine at 30 meters is often cited as being around
140dB.  170dB would be like having 1000 jet engines running at full
power 30 meters away!  Perhaps they stuck the sound sensor into the
horn itself to get that reading!

My personal feeling about horns is that there isn't any substitute for
the original, just as the Model T folks insist on the &quot;Ah-ooo-gah&quot;
horns for their vehicles.
