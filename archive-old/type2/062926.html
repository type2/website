It's been a long time since I've done this.  I remember being just where you
are, though.  Some others may know more than I do...But..   As I recall, there
is a Pin that needs to be driven out with a nail or small drift.  Your push the
door panel and plastic ring (if there is one) down as much as you can and look
carefully.  

I hope there is some truth to this memory.. John Jensen in Annapolis
