Kevin-All,

I use a Craftsman (Sears) torque wrench that measure in
both foot-pounds and Newton-meters. It is a 1/2&quot; drive
and measures from 10-79.5 foot pounds (or 16.9-111.2
Newton meters). It also has a little dial on the handle
for setting the desired torque that allows you to
dial-in *half* pounds of torque. Very nice and not very
expensive. Also rugged as hell and guaranteed for life
to boot!

This is the kind of wrench that &quot;clicks&quot; when the
desired torque range is reached; not the kind with the
little pointer. This style CANNOT over/under-torque
like the pointer style (I said style, not sisters;-)
can and often do.


I believe it was in the $50.00 range, but don't quote
me. If you think that's too expensive, check the price
of damage done from over/under torque-ing your heads,
etc.

&gt; Volks,       What is, in your opinion, the best
&gt; torque wrench to own that
&gt; is applicable to most VW work. All my sockets are
&gt; 3/8 drive, but if a
&gt; 1/2 inch drive torque is better, then I'd just load
&gt; up on 1/2 inch
&gt; sockets.  I notice that the 3/8 wrench goes from
&gt; about 5 to 80 ft/lbs.,
&gt; whereas the 1/2 goes from 25 to 250.  Which one
would
&gt; be a better
&gt; purchase, and if I go for the 1/2 inch drive, then
&gt; what about the proper
&gt; torques below 25 ft/lbs.?  I can't afford both.
