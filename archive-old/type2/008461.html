hey,
i have a little problem. when i fill my gas tank above 1/2 my 72 westy 
really starts to stink super bad, it's so strong your clothes stink when 
you get out of the van, and you can practically taste the gas in the air 
when your in the van. it got so bad one morning i got sick to my 
stomach. i've stopped driving it until i can fix it.
any advice would be awsome.
thanks
peace
kenny
