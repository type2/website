The double relay on the firewall left side controls
the fuel pump. In order to see if it runs, pull the
S-hose loose from the top end where it attaches to the
airflow meter. With the ignition turned on, stick a
finger or a screwdriver handle into the airflow meter
to push the vane open. When the vane is open, the pump
will run unless the double relay is not working. Check
that the multi-wire plug is secured to the airflow
meter; that the two large multi-wire connectors are
secured to the double relay; that the ground wire for
the double relay that attaches to one of the mounting
screws is making good contact. -BaH
