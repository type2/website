&lt;&lt; Went to a small VW carshow in Gatlinburg, TN one year. saw a GT-40 (I

even had a Corvair or Porsche 6 cylinder - I really can't remember.

Sure it was a GT-40 ? The Laser 917 (Similar front but much higher
upswept tail) used a VW pan. BTW, the rumor mill has Ford bringing
back a retro GT-40 to go with the T-Bird and the &quot;49er&quot;...
