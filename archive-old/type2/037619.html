I have no idea about the plug mentioned(actually I think I do...I'll get to
that in a minute), but it sounds like your distributor is not advancing, or a
vacuum leak.  Unless you have a Cr_at_ppy 009, look (I mean listen) for a vacuum
leak between the distributor and the carb. Check to see that the line(both if
present) are corrected. Go ahead and listen all over the intake manifold.  Use
a piece of vacuum or fuel line like a stethescope.  If you do have a 009...well
I don't know. Also, you might want to mention what engine you're talking about
in your next post.  Makes it much easier to diagnose.

The only plug on the bottom of the engine I can think of are the oil galley
plugs, oil pressure relief at the front(FIF) and oil pressure control at the
back.  I don't think they have anything to do with your problem.

Good Luck
