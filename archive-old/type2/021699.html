Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Again

The shift rod bushing replacement. Is there a locale where I could read up on this? I've also thought about the short shifter, but in my little experience behind the wheel of this bus, the tall shifter is kind of neat, and practical.

&gt; &gt;However, a deterent for me keeping the tranny was also the shifting. It seems like the gears

&gt;
&gt; Sounds like a shift rod bushing problem.  On most busses, at least 1, if not all, the bushings are gone.  If you replace them, the shifter tightens up dramatically.  Also, if you want a shorter throw on the shifter, try a short shift kit, which will cost under $10 and about an hour or 2 to install.  Make sure you get the metal short shift kit, as opposed to the plastic one.
