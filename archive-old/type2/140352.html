Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold

I used the George Lyle method- drill a 1/8 inch hole in the heat pipe right 
in line with the long horizontal run, then use the speedo cable straight 
through or the welding rod with the tip twisted into a roto rooter like 
thing.  I used a coat hanger and it broke off in the hole, which I do not 
recommend-it was less than less than fun.  I did finally get it cleared out, 
it wasn't fun but it did work. Then you use a hose clamp over the drilled 
hole. It'll never run well with a plugged heat tube.

Plugged heat risers...has anyone used the muriatic acid method of clearing 
the residual carbon deposits which cause such a problem? If so, please 
relate experience and methods.

I've already tried the &quot;speedo cable in the drill&quot; method- no good for me.

Thanks!
