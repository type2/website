Subject: Re: [T2] Later front disc brakes in a 70 bus?


I would hold this idea in abeyance, while looking for a 71 candidate with
T-I motor and front discs stock if that was what I was after. I don't know
for sure, but it would be suprizing to me if you couldn't bolt in a
complete beam from any later T-II. Yes you would have to update the MC,
maybe add or reroute lines, and put a port on the intake to run to the
booster. Rear brakes should be fine when the lines follow the MC's lead.

&gt;I'm considering returning to the aircooled ranks with
&gt;the purchase of a 70 westy.  Just wondering about
&gt;those drums up front.  Is it possible to swap front
&gt;discs out of a later bus?  Need whole front end,
&gt;master cyl, some way to tap vacuum, right?  Any
&gt;hangups with this?  Rear brake circuits compatible?
