Subject: Re: [T2] moving the battery in a Westy Vanagon?

&gt; I was thinking of trying to move the battery to the

What you need to remember is this: when starting your
bus, power from the battery goes to the Ignition
switch up front FIRST, and then goes to the starter
solenoid, so moving the battery closer to the starter
will have no positive effect on your starting
problems.
