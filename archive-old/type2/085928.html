Subject: Re: [T2] Curtains

My '72 Westy (hard top) has flimsy rods that I suspect are home made. The 
rod for the sliding door goes all the way around the track, including that 
little outcropping on the left, not attaching to the door itself at all. I'm 
not sure what the stock set up is. What I have is some thin (1/8 inch? 
1/16th?)metal screwed into little holes in the body of the van. I'd 
recommend getting something sturdier for yours: mine bend when idiots pull 
on the curtains.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;So I'm making curtains for the '72 Westy, but I can't figure out the 
&gt;sliding door curtain.
&gt;What was the original setup?  Where was the curtain rod and how/where was 
&gt;it attached?
