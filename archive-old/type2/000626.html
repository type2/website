Just a note to let let everyone know that Jim Thompson has been very busy
going to shows. I talked to him this morning and he is currently at the
Orange County Transporters Organization (OCTO). He does not have access to
the internet at this time and that is why nobody has heard from him.

I received a package from him yesterday for an item that was on backorder so
he's still in business. I was very pleased with the item. Thanks Jim.
