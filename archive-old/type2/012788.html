&gt; A much better, modern solution is a product like Mar-Hyde's &quot;One-step&quot;. It's

&gt; liquid...

Now, with something like &quot;One-step&quot; or any other underbody 
treatment, would you pressure wash the bottom of the bus
to remove all the gunk down there first?  Looking at the 
bottom of my bus, there already seems to be a coating
(which is flaking off in places and under which I can see the 
original paint) and I'm not sure if that coating is a rust-proof
coating or just lots of sand/mud/etc. that's been caked on for years.

Any thoughts on the prep work and/or how easy it is to apply
something like &quot;one-step&quot;?
