I second the post quoted below. My AVP rebuilt was done on an FI case, =
so of necessity I have an electric fuel pump. Can anyone point me to a =
wiring diagram? Sounds like a good idea to have the pump shut off if the =
engine stops.

&gt;Can anyone tell me how to wire the double relay mentioned in the &gt;posts =
to=20
&gt;shut off my electric fuel pump if the engine stops? And is the relay=20
&gt;something easily available from FLAPS?
&gt;Thanks in advance.
