Ted and the List,

My recommendation for an exhaust system is to take a look at the Berg
exhausts.  They have one (which I just bought to replace my el cheapo one)
that has tubes welded on that route the air from the fan around the exhaust
pipes coming from number 2 and 4 cylinders.  This makes it a piece of cake
to get air to your heater boxes.  The standard clamps and gaskets all fit
just fine.  I don't know if the S&amp;S header has this feature or not.  It's
definitely worth looking into.  It is a Royal PITA to try and snake your
flex hose through the breast plate, around the exhaust pipes and connect to
the heater boxes (been there, done that, ain't doin' it again).  Also, they
have a header that is specific for your vintage of bus, even one that is
made so that you can put a trailer hitch on if you want.  The one I just
bought came to about $134 which included shipping to Oklahoma, two plastic
hoses that go from the fan housing to the breastplate and the flange kit for
the heater boxes.  This last item is something you should give serious
thought to.  Many on the list have complained about the &quot;factory&quot; gaskets
and clamps in that they don't stay tight and leak free.  I think the flanges
have been covered before so check the archives or p-mail me for more info.
The Berg unit also provides the best ground clearance for the muffler system
(single QP, I don't think the dual QP setup does anything but add more
weight and expense and get in the way of my remote oil filter).

I also run a stock oil pump, 26mm I think, it's been a few years.  A stock
oil pump should be adequate for a properly built engine.  If the bearings
and such aren't right to hold oil pressure, then a high volume pump isn't
the answer either.  Swivel feet valve adjusters are a good idea, but also
give thought to replacing the wavy washers on the rocker arm shaft with a
shim kit.  This is definitely the way to go.  The valve train often gets
overlooked.  Even if you run a stock cam, the exhaust and other
modifications will let your engine rev higher than a stock unit so give some
thought to this area.  You probably don't need &quot;hi rev&quot; valve springs, but
you can shim them up to make them a little stiffer and avoid valve float
which can easily damage your heads.

As for the Beetlemex engine, they are probably OK.  I would NEVER argue with
Mr. Hoover about what it costs to rebuild a motor.  So I agree that you
probably can't rebuild one (properly) for what it would cost to buy a new
motor, BUT, what are you getting?  When you build the motor yourself (or
with the help of a friend) you can do exactly what you are talking about
doing, and that is balancing everything.  With a factory engine you get
factory specs.  You can do much better and then have an engine that will
last that much longer.  You can also take pride in the fact that you built
the engine and get that Karma thing going with your new bus ;-)
