jess-
a floor jack, of course- the brits  like to call it
a trolley jack.
the big one people seem to want most lifts 24 inches,
and is harder to find, they usually quit at 20 inches,
just short enough that you also need a block of wood
to make up the difference, to pull an engine with.
 the smaller , cheaper floor jacks will also do the job,
far less stable, and jack stands, required anyway, are
especially necessary with these...get the best jack stands
you can afford, and the cheaper jack for now, insofar as
this one can travel with you. i mounted one on the frame
rail under the bus with a simple bolt thru it...
check out www.harborfreight_dot_com , and get a free catalog.
can you order from US companies ? the shipping has got
to be outrageous to australia ?!
either way, bottle jacks are bad (unstable ) and factory jacks
are only good for dents in the rocker panels...
