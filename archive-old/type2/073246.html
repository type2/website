&gt;&gt; What's the matter with the list? I'm getting bus posts from
&gt;&gt; somewhere, but not with the type2 return. And so my mail filter no
&gt;&gt; longer works.

There is still one more leg in the server-change relay, should be operative
now. This one involves a DNS switch, then another round of hand-tweaking
the SmartList server, which is dicey to a comical degree and can go on for
weeks.

(I TRIED to switch them into a modern list server but they yelled at me,
got me drunk, dressed me up in funny clothes and threw me in the bushes).

Anyway it's amazing the thing is still running at all. Once the headers
stabilize, it's best to filter for the &quot;X-Loop&quot; headerfield, which only
occurs in SmartList mailing lists and email from procmail geeks, none of
whom are named &quot;type2&quot; or &quot;vintagebus&quot;.

Somebody ought to send David Raistrick a medal. Somebody ought to send him
a dozen roses and some chocolate and a kiss on the nose.
