Subject: odd things

&gt; I noticed a couple of things.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no
&gt; latch and the rubber completely seals them in.



Non opening quarterlights are quite common over here in the UK.  (I don't
know about Westy's specifically.)  - in fact they're probably much more
common than the opening kind.  (Mine are fixed)
