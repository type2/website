&gt;I get out
&gt;the vaccum tester and I have a solid 19&quot; of vacuum, no fluctuating. Huh? Am I
&gt;missing something? I only have problems with the high RPM's when the engine is

&gt;have?

Minimum: 15&quot;
Ideal: 16-19&quot;

Vacuum drops approx 1&quot; for every 1000 ft you are above sea level.

No one seems to remember what the reading is on a brand new factory fresh engine. Who was talking about too high a reading being bad?
