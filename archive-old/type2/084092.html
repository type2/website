Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Brands

-40C or F is the temperature where the two 
scales meet. It is also a temperature where 
your face starts to hurt if you stay out too 
long.

Just finished the oil change and there where 
biege icicles on my the inside of my oil cap, 
also frost in the tube.

I put 10W40 Penzoil Dino in, which I may be 
sorry I did. -40 is also the temp the my 
vehicle used to not even turn over at, until I 
did a massive tune up and started to heat 
the bottom of the engine with a pan heater.

I expect we will be seeing -20C wx very 
soon. That oil will be Fine then.

The oil that came out was tan in colour, it 
was Quaker State 5W50 Synthetic, put in 
two months ago.

&gt; &gt;I guess (;-)), You try changing oil at -40C, see how you
&gt; &gt;like it.
