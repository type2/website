&gt; &gt; 	One idea I've toyed with is to slap a low-drag gauze on the

&gt; &gt; &gt;bursts.  The latent heat of evaporation of water is a peculiarly high

&gt; &gt; &gt;this should give the cooling fins cooler air.

&gt; I have thought about this too, but just using a mister. Look at
&gt; mistymate_dot_com. Attach a small pump and have it mist water into the air.

&gt; Hm...  Seems like you could pull a lot of moisture into the engine that
&gt; way...  A bad thing?

If the amount of water is controlled it will be completely vaporized
before it reaches the engine.  The heat required for vaporization is what
reduces the cooling air temperatures.

There are RV auxilary cooling systems that spray water on the radiator for
the same effect.
