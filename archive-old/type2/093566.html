Subject: Re: [T2] STOP ! ! (please)

Hi George, 

yes the units given are wrong but both your answer and the original answer are wrong. 

the stopping time is not given by dividing the distance by the deceleration nor by dividing the velocity by the deceleration. 

Basic newtonian laws of motion (rendered into a mathematical form) state 

S=ut ft**2/2 

where s is distance, u is intitial velocity, f is the acceleration, and t is the time 

so given that 60mph = 88feet per second 

167 = 88t - 23t**2/2 

solving the resulting quadratic (11.5t**2 - 88t 167 = 0) gives (approximately) 

t = -0.8 or 8.5 

-0.8 may be discounted as an unreal answer giving a stopping time of 8.5 seconds 

But personaly I don't care, I enjoy driving my bus however long it takes to stop. I just know it will not stop on a dime so leave a bigger gap in front of me! 

good luck

&gt; &gt; Lunch time reading:  Old magazine article says the 'new' 1971 VW bus, with
&gt; &gt; the front disk brakes, can go from 60 MPH to full stop in just 167 feet.
&gt; &gt; Rate of stop is 23 ft/sec, with a G rate about .72.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it is just over 7 sec^-1, a totally meaningless measurement since
&gt; sec^-1 is a unit of frequency!  The problem is that the units on the
&gt; acceleration are wrong.  It should be 23ft/s^2 or 23ft/sec/sec.
&gt; 
&gt; 60mph is 88ft/s.
&gt; 
&gt; 88ft/s / 23ft/s^2 = 3.8s
