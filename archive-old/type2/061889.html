&lt;&lt; ok the subject tells it all. i hit a deer today with my 71 im sad. 
 anyway does anyone have some suggestions on a good way to fix the dent.   &gt;&gt;
Doug,
   I would first straiten the nose as much as possible.  This is one of the
first rules of panel replacement, but it also gives you an idea on wither you
can save your original nose.  Best bet is a Hyd. ram, but for the lack of one
of those you can get by with a Hyd. bottle jack, a 4 x4 piece of wood, and a
bout a 12 inch piece of 2 x 6.  Drill a hole in the end of the 4 x 4 so that
the ram of the jack fits into it a couple of inches to keep it from slipping.
Always start at the out side edges of the dent, first in last out. Your gonna
basically turn one big dent in to a bunch of little dents.  Just be sure to
not push to far.  Your going to have to push a little and then check an see
how far the metal rebounds, a straight is great for checking.  Drilling holes
for a dent puller is a thing of the past.  Most body shops use dent masters
and stud guns now a days.  These leave no holes.  You can get the same result
by welding tabs on to the nose and rigging a C-clamp to your old slid hammer.
Once you've pulled, cut the tab down and grind it off.  The main thing to
remember is to keep the heat down.  If after a while, the nose is just to
wrinkled to save, you can move on to replacing it.  But the cool part is
you've straighten everything as far as it will go.  This will make replacement
so much easier!  If you decide to replace, let me know and I can shoot some
more info to yea.
   Peace, Love, and guess it could have been worse---could have been a moose!
