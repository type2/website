Subject: Leak down test, WHAT?

Please pardon my lack of any tact here. A leak down test can't, I REPEAT, 
can't be done with a hand pump. Any real leak-down tester ( at least one that 
is designed for internal combustion eng.'s that power a motor vehicle, and 
not a weed-wacker)is supplied with shop air, on the scale of 80-100psi., _at_ 3 
or above CFM. The tester should have two gauges. One measures inlet air 
pressure, giving you a baseline, the other, down stream gauge, measures 
percentage of loss, or leak-down, thus the name. Secondly, the eng. must be 
manually held at TDC for the cyl. being tested. Just bringing said cyl. to 
TDC and then applying air is going to cause it to move down, just like if it 
were on the power stroke of its cycle. And the cyl. being tested needs to be 
EXACTLY at its respective TDC. Both valves closed. If not, your test is moot. 
Remember that you are trying to simulate the actuall conditions present in 
the combustion chamber at the moment the piston hits TDC. This won't happen 
with a hand pump, no matter what the person who sold you the tester says.
