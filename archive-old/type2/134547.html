Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

No.  The tin is not a significant &quot;heat radiator&quot; when it comes to engine
cooling.  Painting the tin any color, with any paint, should not adversely
affect cooling.

&gt; Gerald,
&gt;
&gt; I agree with this train of thought, I am curious as to what your opinion
is
&gt; on painting tin, I was thinking about painting my fan shroud and cylinder
&gt; head tin pieces and such with super high temp paint.
&gt;
&gt; Would that have any affect on the engines cooling system? (1600 dual)
