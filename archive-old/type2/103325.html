&gt; so my question is what about those hotter temperatures initially. now it seems ok but what are the limits.  what is the 'red line'??

I think the guages are all over the ballpark and engines are different, I
suspect the typeIV engines may run hotter but maybe the drivers drive em
harder too.   use the guages to seek your buses relative levels then when
something changes you notice the change not the absolute temp

&gt; I am no longer scared of 240-250 degree oil.  I run Mobil-1 synthetic.

with my nice tight rebuilt 2liter I see from a sump guage with Mobil-1
synthetic

190-210 around town easy driving or in the winter

230 max out on the road cruising at 60-65
240 max I'll let it get pushing hard on a hot day

250 pull over under a tree and figure out what is wrong.  let the engine
fast idle and maybe open rear engine door (Standing still) if temps still
keep rising shut it off have it towed home find out what is wrong (so far
has never happened)
