High to low compression cylinder are at 25% difference.  Usually a wear limit.

3 &amp; 4 even?  Hmmm...    Head gaskets installed on left side, and not on right?
Cylinder spacers only on left side.  Cylinder to block mating surface machined
only on right side?  Rebuilt heads?  One head may have been welded up and ended
up with a smaller combustion chamber volume.

Gas in the oil, right?  Are the left side plugs wet, gassy smelling, or fluffy
black deposits?  How do they compare to the right side plugs?  Even the
imbalance on the right side would alarm me on one of my rebuilds.

Still in warranty?  Give the vendor a call.  What does the list think an adequet
breakin period should be?  And, shouldn't the cylinders breakin fairly
uniformly?

While you go through the engine exchange process, you can trouble shoot the FI
function.  I have found many FI wiring looms damaged by mechanics who like to
shove sharp meter leads through the insulation, breaking the wires, rather than
going to the connector plugs.  Most other FI function can be duplicated on the
bench without the engine. This is also a very good way to gain a good working
knowledge of the FI system and its function.
