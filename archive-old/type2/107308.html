&gt; I was a little concerned about the connector that I was going to use to hook
&gt; the pressurized line from the tank to the line that runs to the valve in the
&gt; column.  Will a simple push-on connector hold the pressure without leaking?
&gt; I really like the idea of being able to disconnect the tubing for when I
&gt; might have to take the column apart.

It depends on the hose. VW used a fairly soft hose with a ID 1mm smaller
than the valve OD. Then they used some shrink tubing to secure the hose over
the barb on the washer valve. Over time the original hose shows signs of
stress and the shrink tubing seems to have expanded with age.

You don't need to remove the hoses to disassemble the column. You can simply
unscrew the valve with a jewelers sized screw driver and leave the hoses
attached.

BTW, I created this page a while back:
