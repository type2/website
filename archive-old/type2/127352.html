Subject: continental vanco 8 personal experiences

Hello folks,

I know the tire issue gets boring. Sorry.

I'm all set to spend $316 at Western Tire tomorrow. 
This is the total cost for 4 Continental Vanco 8 size
185-r14's mounted, balanced, sales tax and epa
fees....everything.  I've been searching here and
thesamba for people's personal experiences with this
tire, and haven't found much.   Has anyone been using
these continentals for any length of time?  I'd like
to know:

what psi do you fill yours to?

how's the treadwear so far?

are these tires a lot heavier than passenger tires?
should i expect any decrease in gas mileage using
them, opposed to p205/75-14?

do they handle well on dirt roads and light offroad
conditions? in the rain?

anyone have anything bad to say about getting these
tires, or any cautious suggestions?

I've had my bus (1970 Westie) for almost a year now,
and have taken it on some pretty crazy adventures. 
The generic passenger tires on it have done well.  I
am about to drive from Tucson, AZ to western NC in
four weeks, loaded with stuff.  Then, if all goes
according to plan, ALASKA!!  Woohoo.  So,  I'm
figuring on new ball joints (tangent: anyone get
busboys torsion arms?? did they give you the full core
on your old ones?) and proper tires.  300 bucks is a
lot of money for me....  Thank you for any assistance.
 Here is a link to some pics I took in Rocky Point,
Mexico, on the Sea of Cortez.  My most recent fun bus
trip!

P.S.  I tried posting this message this morning from
my main email at cox_dot_net.  It didn't go through,
nor did it just now.  I think my domain may be getting
blocked, although I'm getting the digest emails like
usual on my cox address.
