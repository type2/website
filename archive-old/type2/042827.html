Subject: Observations on Bus Owners Driving Techniques

So I sold one of my busses today. A very nice ' 77 hard-top Westy, with a ' 
78 2.0L FI eng. that got a mild rebuild ( by yours truly, who does this for a 
living, and owns his own chasis dyno...) around 22k ago. The folks who bought 
it were nice people, they pulled up in a ' 75 Westy, and it looked to be in 
okay condition. They claimed to have owned several busses in the past. We go 
out for a test drive, and I almost lost my mind, and thought seriously about 
not selling to them. To wit; These folks observed a max. shift point RPM of 
2500. Always. Then claimed that the eng. was not rebuilt correctly as it 
&quot;lacked power&quot;. When I attemped to explain that they had just begun to get 
into the power band at 2500RPM, I was told that &quot;...No, people on the Type2 
List, and especially a man named &quot;Capt. Mike&quot; at the Westfalia Owners website 
told us that busses/Vanagons are to never be driven over 55mph, or at any 
more than 2/3 throttle. You see, these engines just can't take the strain...&quot; 
After we switched drivers, they got an education, and an explaination on how 
you make 67 stock hp move a Westy. Keep the RPM's up. Simple enough. If the 
eng. is in its power band, these little machines will move along quite 
nicely, and stay cool. They were impressed. They also figured out that their 
' 75 actually had enough power if they drove it like VW intended. Money 
changed hands, they went away happy. I, however was a bit cheesed. Went and 
checked the Archives...I didn't see any mention of 55mph being the max speed, 
but I did find quite a few posts where people said that they never put the 
pedal all the way to the floor, or turned more than 3200RPM. Why is this? You 
won't hurt anything. Really! The little type4 eng. was designed to turn high 
rpms, for extended periods of time. Slow piston speed, bullet-proof bottem 
end. Give it a try. You'll be rather happy with the results. And so a closing 
question. Am I the only one who drives like I've been pithed? Do most of you 
folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming near red-line, for any reason? Never 
exceed 60mph? Now I'm very curious...
