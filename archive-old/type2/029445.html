This is an interesting idea, but what percentage of the vehicle fleet
could be fueled by the existing supply of cooking oil/grease?

I can see the advertising now:

&quot;Support alternative fuels, eat more french fries!&quot;

&quot;McDonalds, now serving both human and automotive tastes!&quot;

&quot;Fuel up at Chez Francais, for that exclusive aroma of white wine in your
exhaust!&quot;

&quot;Come to Joe's Truck Stop Cafe; more food for you, more grease for your
car!&quot;

BTW, I don't think that this idea is all that new.  I recall someone a few
years back running a Diesel Rabbit on deep fryer grease.
