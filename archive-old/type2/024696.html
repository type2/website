I'll try to be brief.

I'm a neurodiagnostic technologist, which means I study the functioning of 
the nervous system non-invasively.  Currently I work for a contract service 
provider which requires a lot of traveling (1000+ miles a week).  My '71 
Westy couldn't take it, so we got a '93 Isuzu Trooper for all the work stuff 
(lots of equipment).  I go to hospitals all over the Southeast (Huntsville 
AL, Atlanta GA, Lexington KY, etc.) and I'm based in Knoxville, TN.  
Currently all I do is monitor the nervous system during surgery in those 
patients whose nervous system is at risk (spine surgery, brain surgery).

I also teach.
