Subject: www.type2_dot_com -- Frameless Version Now Available


I finished coding the noframes version of type2_dot_com so we should now be
able to accomodate everybody back to level 2 graphical browsers. I still
have to draw a button for it on the frames page but you can go straight
there:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/noframes_index.html

AFAIK all links now work including the &quot;Feature&quot; button, which has one
excellent article but we desperately need more features. If you have an
article on your page which is well illustrated please let me link it as a
feature article. I'm talking about technical stuff here mostly, not &quot;look
at my bus&quot; stuff. Talk to me or the hot-shot features editor Chris Cybulski
&lt;features_at_type2_dot_com&gt; 8).
