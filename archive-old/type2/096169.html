&gt; My friend has a '78 automatic fuel injected bus.  It just recently had a

&gt; haven't figured out is that it quits every time it gets warmed up.  It
&gt; usually happens when we come to a stop and only sometimes will it start back
&gt; up.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what this problem could be?  Thanks
&gt; a lot.

bet he tuned it using manual tranny spec's auto tranny is slightly
different, although it still should run.

check the temp sensor II mounted near cyl #3

did he change the fuel filter??
