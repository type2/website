Hey Volks,

Next week I'm leaving on the first of several long summer trips.  I will be
leaving Springfield, Missouri on Tuesday, May 22 and I'll be headed for the
Florida panhandle area.  I will be passing through NE Arkansas to Memphis,
Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to Mobile,
Alabama and finally to Pensacola, Florida.  Since this is the first trip of
the summer it would be nice to know a few listmember names along the way.
This extra assurance is in case something breaks along the way or I need the
one wrench or $2 part that I forgot to bring and can't seem to find.  If you
don't mind being on my list of people to call if I really NEED something,
please send me your local phone number and the town where you live.  If you
know of anything VW or bus related that's worth checking out along (or close
to) the way please let me know this too.  I will be driving my green 76
Westy Deluxe with a small blue trailer carrying two bikes and a kayak.  Wave
if you see me and I'll wave back.  Take care.

Randall and Kermit (The lean, green, mean machine)
