&lt;&lt; I know everyone always bashes Gex, but has anyone had any experience with 
there stock heads, if so how have they performed and have there been any 
problems. I have spoken with them and they say they do reinforce the seats 
to prevent the dropped seat problem. Any insight would be great. I know 
someone that has a new unused set. They are remanufactured of course.

I had a free type 1 rebuilt from their shop...Lasted a month. Everything
about them is a crapshoot; you could get real lucky and the heads could
last...Or they could lose a valve and destroy the rest of your engine. My
guess is that an awful lot of GEX motors end up in about to be sold VW's
so they can be advertised with &quot;rebuilt engine&quot; in the advert...The new
owner gets to pick up the pieces...
