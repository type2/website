&gt; what is the average $$ people spend on their beloved

&gt; 
&gt; i was lucky enough to not have to pay for the
&gt; purchase of my bus, but i 
&gt; have certainly paid since the day i brought it home.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; this is more than i 
&gt; have paid and put into my h*nda prelude ('89.)  yet
&gt; the satisfaction is 
&gt; greater.  

&lt;more snip&gt;

&gt; it is amazing that i love this bus SO much, so much,


Missy,

Not to contradict a major German auto manufacturer,
but sometimes perception IS reality.

I know of a man who lives in abject poverty so he
could drive a BMW 5-series that he paid full price for
and he couldn't be happier.  On the other hand, I
bought a two year old Renault Alliance for $1,000.00
and felt like I got taken to the cleaners.

What a car is worth, IMHO, depends on how much it
returns to you in perceived value.  You can spend $50K
on a vehicle, and if it does what you want (go fast,
look cool, haul heavy loads, sleeps 6, etc.) then you
walk away feeling like you got your money's worth. 
But then again, if you are looking for a cheep
commuter car, and find a Rolls Royce for $6,000,
you'll end up very disappointed after paying for gas,
tires, maintenance, if all you really wanted was a
Japanese encono box...

I personally own a Ford grocery getter that I bought
at wholesale when it was three years old,  I also
bought a '69 Westy that sat in somebody's back yard
for four years and still needs plenty of TLC to get
back on the road for $400.

Guess which one brings me more smiles per dollar
spent?

Just my 2 cents...
