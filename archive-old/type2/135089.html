Subject: RE: [T2] Falling dollar and bus parts

&gt; Ron (and others):
&gt;
&gt; If the fall in the value of the dollar is long-term (and I don't know
&gt; enough about international financial markets to speculate about
&gt; this), does that provide incentives for domestic producers to start
&gt; supplying aftermarket parts? Were they kept out by cheap
&gt; Brazilian parts?


The Bush administration has basically been content to simply let the dollar
fall, because they feel it will help our huge trade deficit. A weak dollar
makes American made products cheaper to buy overseas, to the benefit of U.S.
manufacturers who export. It also makes foreign products more expensive
here, encouraging people to &quot;buy American.&quot;  The problem is that in many
cases &quot;buying American&quot; simply isn't an option.

The world market was waiting to see who would win our election, as a new
administration might have reversed the course. When Bush got re-elected, a
lot of investors immediately sold off their dollars, feeling that the
administration would continue its present policies and the dollar would
continue to sink.  They wanted to unload their dollars before they became
even more worthless. Of course, when everyone wants to sell something at
once, the price drops.  So the dollar's value fell dramatically within the
first few weeks after our election.  Since there are still no signs that
anything will be done in the near future to prop up the dollar, it's seems
to be continuing its freefall. This means that all imported products will
get more and more expensive.

Yes, some products can be made in the U.S. to offset these higher prices.
Cars, for example. In fact this is one reason why VW is in a very bad
position here in the States; they're one of the few major U.S. car suppliers
who doesn't have a U.S. factory. Their competitors are already making plans
to assemble more cars here, but VW doesn't have a factory to do it in. This
does not bode well for VW's near-term future in the U.S. market.

Other products simply cannot be made in the U.S. at a competitive price.
You're unlikely to see a lot of consumer electronics or computer gear made
here, for example, because as expensive as importing the product may be,
it's still cheaper to pay someone in China a dollar an hour to make it than
to pay union labor to make it here.  Everyone wants their $29 Walmart DVD
player, and that's not compatible with U.S. manufacturing. So those products
will stay foreign made but simply go up in price.

By the same token you won't see many Bus parts made here.  Part of it is the
inability to compete with the cost of manufacturing in Brazil, Mexico, and
China, even with the weaker dollar. Not just because of the wage issue, but
because of the cost of tooling up for a part where production may already
exist overseas. There isn't enough sales volume potential for old Bus parts
to justify the tooling investment. So while there will certainly be an
increase in U.S. made auto parts in general, it will be in parts for modern
cars with high volume sales potential, not parts for old busses.

Instead, when it comes to Bus parts we're likely to see two trends. First,
all parts will go up in price, some significantly. Many suppliers have been
&quot;biting the bullet&quot; and absorbing the cost increases over the last year or
so, hoping for a change in November that would signal a reversal of the
dollar's fortunes. Now they're giving up on this strategy, and instituting
massive price increases to make up for lost time and money. For example,
Koni has not had a price increase since the Euro was about $1.10.  Now it's
$1.35. This means that each shock they sell in the U.S. costs them about 20%
more than it did when they last set their U.S. prices, and they've simply
been absorbing that. Of course they will have to make an adjustment sooner
or later to cover that gap, and as soon as one shock supplier does, the rest
will follow suit. VW had played the same waiting game, and just recently
introduced widespread parts price increases - some as much as 50 to 80
percent!!!  Even if the dollar situation improves, it is highly unlikely
that parts pricing will ever be completely rolled back, especially on
low-volume parts like Bus parts.

The other trend you will see will be the unavailability of German made
parts. Germany's economy is not great right now, and German auto parts
manufacturers are having a hard time selling in the U.S. because the
dollar's weak value makes their parts very expensive here. Several are at
the point of simply giving up on the U.S. market until the situation
improves. Or moving production to China or elsewhere. When a particular
German Bus part becomes uneconomical (or impossible) to import from Germany,
one of two things may happen. Either it may simply go obsolete, or else a
replacement may be offered from Brazil, Mexico, India, China, eastern
Europe, etc.  That replacement, if it is available at all, may end up almost
as expensive as the German one was. Not just because of the weaker dollar,
but also because there is no longer a German part to compete with it. The
German part presented the low-cost supplier with a price &quot;ceiling.&quot; No one
would pay more for a Mexican part than its German counterpart, so there was
only so much they could charge for the Mexican part. With their German
competitor gone (or priced out of the market), they can charge as much as
the market will bear. So, in a nutshell, parts prices will go up everywhere,
some production will move out of Germany, and some parts will simply go
away.

I wish I believed that this would be a short term thing that would go away
quickly, but I'm a bit skeptical. I personally do not expect it to improve
dramatically at least over the next year or so. Then again I'm not an
economist and I very much hope to be proven wrong.  It would be possible for
either our government or those in Europe or Japan to take steps to slow the
dollar's decline, in the interest of global economic stability, but so far I
haven't read any strong indication of it happening.  Even if it did happen
it would take quite a long time to reverse the decline (which itself took
years to build up). Still, I can only hope.

Meanwhile, I strongly advise anyone who needs parts for their Bus to buy
them sooner rather than later. The situation does not bode well for the
availability of quality Bus arts at cheap prices in the U.S., at least over
the forseeable future. As I said in my original post, I am now paying 10% to
25% more for every part that I have to replace when I sell out of inventory.
So is every other supplier. Prices will go up everywhere, sometimes by a
large margin.  That is a certainty.
