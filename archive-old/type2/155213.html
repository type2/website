I had written
&gt;One could read this kind of idea in the Pop Mech magazines years ago; but AYMK
&gt;with then-existing technology the performance was poor

Robt Mann responded
        I think this is an unfortunate term.  It has been easy for a 
half-century to convert a car, e.g a Beetle, to burn rubber at 70mph 
or more  -  to outperform most petrol cars in speed &amp; acceleration. 
The key problem has been RANGE  i.e battery storage.

--------------------

Response [since it's Friday perhaps the moderators will let this pass?]

Agreed... RANGE is a better way to state the matter. The key problem is battery 
energy storage capacity relative to battery weight, as you know.  If we 
installed enough batteries to run 75 miles whilst running an air conditioning 
system, let's say, the weight would be impractically high. 

I was in Phoenix, AZ, a few weeks ago visiting the 7=&quot; gauge railroad club 
there.  One of the members (younger guy, Dan Tack) was talking about the way he 
built his model of an EMD F-7, using golf cart motors and controls.  He could 
easily pull 20 adults all day long at 20 mph thanks to the low rolling friction 
of steel wheels on rail.  

I know (through mutual friends) a man who runs a golf-cart factory.  Gotta 
remember to talk with him about electrifying my Microbus when I get settled in 
my new home.  A range of 20 miles would suffice for grocery store runs :-))

Cheerio
