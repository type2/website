&gt; more of a spike to work.  So we ended up using a second coil to create the

&gt; My question is how have you dealt with this problem? especially on a early

David,

I worked a similar problem with a fuel pump shut off relay and as you found out
the circuit is designed to work with a coil.  The coil provides the large (much
much greater than 12V) spike than the simple 12V on and off signal from the
points.  There are modifications that can be made to the ECU but I would
recommend against that.  On the fuel pump relay there is a 100K signal in series
with the tach signal line that I will reduce to 100-1000 ohms when I convert
&gt;from coil to the tiger unit (I have CIS FI).

I believe that Bob Hoover has installed the unit in a bay window, but don't know
if it had fuel injection.  He could provide some possible input on the subject.

One thing that you might experiment with is get a varity of inductors and put
them in place of the coil and see if enough voltage is developed to trigger the
ECU.  If you get the combination right, it will draw less current than the coil
and still trigger the ECU.
