&gt; I just installed a new tiger 581 on my 78 FI westfalia. It works fine 
&gt; but makes a high pitched squeal when the ignition is turned on. To 
&gt; anyone who has one of these installed, is this normal? 

This is normal. Kind of sounds like an old school TV when on.

&gt; ...This module was 
&gt; modified by Universal to accomodate the tach pulse requirements of the 
&gt; Bosch ECU...

Glad to hear they make one now. I bought one three years ago and it's 
still sitting in a box because I haven't figured out how to overcome the 
technical problems of that crossover to make it work on my '78. WHen 
hooked up, my car won't start. I built the crossover box described in 
their instructions (and kindly reprinted for us on this list by Sami 
Dahklia a few years ago), but it doesn't go. Apparently that works on a 
'76 with it's earlier verson FI, but not on a '78 with air flow 
controlled FI. But the CDI does make that high pitched whine while 
failing to work.

BTW, did your gas mileage or performance improve after installing CDI, as 
claimed by Bob Hoover in his Sermons and by CDI promotional literature?

Drive safely,
