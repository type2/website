Subject: dual dellorto tuning

I have installed my rebuilt dellorto 36mms on our 2.0l bus engine. My 
question being how to set the air fuel mixture right. It smells like it is running 
rich. I have a carb syncro tool and will sync the carbs but what about the air 
fuel mix. Is in or out less fuel or any other ideas to start with. Thanks 
Dylan.  I would prefer not to get into jetting yet until I have an understanding of 
the basics. 
PS we are running a one step up on the cam, solid lifters and 050 dizzy with 
electronic points, flame thrower coil. Seems to have good power already.
