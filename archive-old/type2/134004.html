&gt;&gt;I tried that a few years ago and killed two clocks in the process. Same idea
as you - I presume - early face clock with a reliable quartz movement ..

The face and the hands were mounted slightly different. I am sure it can be
done, but I did not suceed when I tried it.

Speaking of clock faces - I always see the early faces referred to as 68-72,
but both of my 74s (March production date) have the early gray face. When
did they change to the black faces?

&gt;has anyone considered changing out the face of a late bay clock and
&gt;installing a 68-72 face. is there a chance of that? - steve
