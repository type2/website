&gt; You got it!  good absorbers are good emitters!  Otherwise, something that
&gt; was a good emitter but a poor absorber would naturally sit at a
&gt; temperature below ambient, a violation of the second law of thermo.
	[Crick, Bill ]  Man I just got to get me a can of this stuff. Think
of how 
	much propane it would save on the cottage fridge.

	My gut feel is that even on the case bottom, convection is more
important than
	radiation, so painting the case will insulate it, reducing heat
transfer more than
	the increased radiation helps.
&gt; &gt; Back when I was doing more with passive solar heating
&gt; &gt; systems, it was surprising how well some colors worked
&gt; &gt; instead of flat black.
	From the  last I heard, a specific dark green is best FOR ABSORBING
SUNLIGHT.


&gt; Silver is almost as good as black in absorbtion, even though most folk
&gt; think of silver as a light, reflective color.
	Silver the metal, or silver the color?

	Cheers
