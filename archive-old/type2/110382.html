&lt;&lt; Geico, and most others however will NOT insure the car for anything other
than what the Kelley Blue Book would value it at. And, well.. despite what
WE make think our cars are worth, the truth is that it is a 30 year old car,
and while 99.9% of the country may see an old car and say.. &quot;OH! I'd LOVE to
have one of those&quot;. The truth is, they wouldn't ever conceive of the idea
that they could actually own one, or that they would pay a decent amount of
money for one.. so our cars a devalued significantly. The only value our
cars have is to the collector car market, which the KBB doesn't seem to be
on par with.

Tough call...Insurance companies have an obvious vested interest in keeping
their claims down and to them, there's not a lot of difference between a VW
van and a Chevy or Ford van. A few states already have had discussions a-
bout limiting &quot;antique&quot; or &quot;historic&quot; plates to vehicles that are 'recognized'
as 'special/rare/etc.'
VW Beetles are historic; most Beetles are not since so many were produced.
Same thing with 60's Mustangs, Renault 2CV's, etc.
The other extreme is/are the eBay folks, selling bits and pieces of old cars
to those interested in complete 'originality'...One of my favs is the guy ask-
ing a couple of hundred bucks for a convertible top that, even according to
the seller, was only suitable for use as a pattern... ;-(
