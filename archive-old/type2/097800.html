Subject: Clutch compatablity question.

Ok, I was just looking over my engine stuff, and I fear that there is a 
compatablity issue.

My tranny is a five ribb, and takes the Bosch type D starter, so I suppose 
that is like a 78 on, but not sure.

My engine is a 2 liter, with engine code GE

Yeah, well my clutch and disk are Sachs, 215mm.......not the right one? I 
think maybe the clutch was from the original engine to my 74, which probably 
was 1800.  It has run ok for years, but now I had this clutch not disengaging 
problem, and since I got the engine out, I might as well attend to this while 
I can.

Thanks all.
