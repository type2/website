Subject: Re: [T2] solex 34 pict 3 tuning/timing

&gt; go here: http://www.w-p-c_dot_com/buggy3.htm

&gt; and here: http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/009.html

Okay, I read the above articles and found the following:

&quot;First, most original distributors in the dual port were designed to run 
with an idle timing of 5 degrees AtdC (After Top Dead Center). The 009 
should be timed at 10 degrees BtdC (Before Top Dead Center). Setting the 009 
at a timing mark of  5 AtdC would give you an inadequate advance of about 17 
degrees total.

   Now your engine may idle nicely but you risk melting a piston.&quot;

The question I have is the issue of melting a piston. I've often heard of 
this danger with incorrect timing, but I'd like more information on the 
cirmstances and conditions under which a piston is at risk.

As I understand it, severe overheating can be caused by too lean a mixture, 
or timing advanced too much. But the article above seems to imply that a 
piston can melt if timing is not advanced enough. Also, I understood that 
these serious conditions occur at high rpm. I wouldn't imagine that you 
would melt down a piston with incorrect timing at idle.

Comments anyone?

thanks,

John
