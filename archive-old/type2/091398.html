Subject: Re: [T2] My first &quot;Westy&quot; Question!!

did the trim change over the years? on my 70, which i just installed a
new seal for (long one, not the short middle one) it has metal clips
inside it which merely pinch the edge of the fiberglass top (or so i was
told AFTER i glued the damn thing on!!). now the smaller middle one i
installed with 3M weather strip adhesive as i was advised to use.
actually, the instructions that came with mine suggested 3M.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I put up the pop-top the seal around the edge of the pop-up 
sags  for
&gt; &gt; several feet in various places.  I can't see what's to keep this 
seal  in
&gt; &gt; place, unless I'm supposed to use some sort of glue or sealer.   The 
seal
&gt; &gt; itself is flexible and supple. What's the &quot;cure&quot; for this problem?
&gt; &gt; TIA!
