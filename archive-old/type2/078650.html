Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires.

I attached the mount to the bus in the stock method 4x 10-28 fine threaded 
screws tapped into 4 nut-serts in the front skin. Very little support IF 
the tire isn't sitting on the bumper top.

This is the same mount that came on the bus when i got it and the same 
mount I have seen on other vans so I think it is may be the OEM mount.

Remember the weight of the tire is on the bumper and the mount only keeps 
it from falling off the front of the bus.

It is stout enough to allow me to carefully climb onto the cab roof 
(luggage rack) because again there is no weight on the nose.

Ciao!
