I think one of your brakes is dragging (this heats up the fluid, which expands
and has the same effect as pressing the brake pedal). Next time it happens, pull
over and test the temperature of each wheel with your hand. Be careful, as if
the brakes are really dragging, the offending wheel will be HOT. The wheels
should be cold. If any one is warm, then your problem is probably there. For the
front, you would need to (first) clean up the pads &amp; check that they were
sliding properly. Also clean up the visible parts of the pistons, and press them
back into their bores &amp; carefully pump them part way out again (safest done with
pads installed) to confirm that they aren't binding. If that doesn't work, you
may be into rebuilding the calipers (not a hard job), but check what spares you
can get before you start.

For the rear, check the adjustment (back off the handbrake cables), make sure
the handbrake is releasing properly (no pinched or split sections on the
flexible section going into the back-plates), make sure the release springs are
in position between the shoes, and that the shoes are free to slide. Make sure
the adjusters are roughly equally adjusted, and check that the wheel cylinder
isn't binding (both 'ends' should be movable).

Note that because of the way the dual circuit is split, a problem on any front
or rear wheel could also apply the brakes on the opposite one. The problem wheel
will always get hot first.

Also, (late thought, but possibly more likely than the above) check that the
pedal is returning fully (spring there &amp; OK ?). On my (non servo) master
cylinder there is a clearance which must be adjusted between the m/cyl piston
and the actuating rod - does yours need anything similar ?
