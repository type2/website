&gt; Hello list-
&gt;    I've got a '71 Adventure Camper highroof that needs brake work.  
&gt; Unfortunately, the calipers appear to be very rusty and the rotors are too 
&gt; thin to turn.  I have a few later model parts buses and was wondering if 
&gt; anyone has done a swap from the 71-72 brakes to the 73-79 brakes?  I don't 
&gt; want to spend a mint on this, as I'm just putting it on the road to sell, 
&gt; but if anyone has experiance with this, could you tell me how far I have to 
&gt; go?  Are the spindles the same or do I need to change them also? Thanks

You have to change everything from the spindles out.  The caliper mount is
offset about a quarter of an inch inboard to allow for the thicker pads.

BTW, the swap will give you longer pad life, but not increased braking.
The pads are thicker, but all other dimensions are the same.
