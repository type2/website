Subject: Unused Fuel Line Life

Howdy All -
It's been a long time since I've posted -- nice to be back.  Hey, stored in
my 79 bus I've got many meters of unused fuel line that I purchased new back
in late 1998 with the intention of changing my existing fuel lines.  Well,
up until now I have not yet gotten around to changing them, and am now
beginning to feel like I'm really gambling each time out.  (I plan to change
them the next dry day -- really.)  Anyway, although the replacement fuel
line still looks new and seems fine externally, I have to keep in mind that
it has been sitting unused inside my bus for almost 4 years through a
variety of seasons ranging from quite hot to very cold.  Do you think it is
possible for the fuel line to have deteriorated at all just sitting there
all this time (making it less than safe to now install this much later), or
do you think it is still good to go?  Thanks for your opinions!
