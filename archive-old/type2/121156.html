Subject: RE: [T2] FW: AridZona VW show New Date 

I just got off the phone with Al Fleming at Beaudry.  The show is moved 
to March 27, but he seemed tentative on that.  Didn't want to conflict 
with the Bug o Rama show in Phoenix, but neither of us knew when the 
Phoenix show is happening.

They are calling it the Beaudry Evolution Show.  Highlighting the 
revolution of the models.  He seemed like a nice guy.  He will be 
emailing me with more details once he has them.  There will be a swap 
meet.   He said there would be an R-32 there, but I forgot to ask what 
an R-32 is.

I am getting $200 in brake parts from Bus Depot today.  Another weekend 
working on bus stuff, and I can't wait.  Anyone in Tucson want to have a 
group brake bleeding session?   My apartment complex neighbors are 
starting to think I am a car nut, and my finger nails haven't been 
really clean for a week!  Does anyone know the bolt size for the front 
wheel cylinders on a 1970?  I have four new Brazilian ones coming, and 
would love to use new bolts.  I'm not going to drink any booze tonight, 
so the brake cleaner has a fresh liver to work on.  Is that stuff as 
toxic as I've read, cause I plan on using a lot of it.
