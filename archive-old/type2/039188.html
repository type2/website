Subject: Need tranny in southern Illinois
Content-Disposition: inline

Darrell Boehler, temporarily off the list, is in need of a tranny for a
late bus.  He wants to leave for a crosscountry trip in a few days and his
78  091 has died.  If anyone has a serviceable one available, please
contact Darrell directly at midwesty_at_midwest_dot_net.  He is in southern
Illinois but will pay shipping from other parts of the country.

Bill
