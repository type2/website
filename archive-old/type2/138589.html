Subject: Power brake booster

As I stated in a previous post, my 74 single cab with factory front disk 
brakes has NO power brake booster, never had one from the factory.  This 
truck was originally exported from tha factory to Panama.

In my experience, a disk brake bus with a NON functioning servo is MUCH more 
difficult to stop than a disk brake bus that never had a servo.  There must 
be something in the servo itself that adds to this difficulty.  My SC stops 
just fine with only slightly more effort than my 79 campe (with working 
power brakes).  greg
