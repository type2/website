snip!

&gt;  I can't clue you as to whether the back bumper has a bracket,

it should have a bracjket on the rear bumper.that is what allows the
diagoanl tent pole to attach at the back, check out joe clarks's westy page
it has a good pictures of numerous different tents set up

i wanna tent too :) or is that two??
