Subject: Silver Socket Adapter

 I got off the phone with the guys from BMW motorcycles and asked
them if they had an American style 12volt adapter to fit in the silver
socket.  The answer was thet had plugs for your 12 volt cord, you'll just
have to remove the amercan head and replace it with theirs.  He said it
would be $7.  I would still be interested to know if I can use the electricity
that runs to my fridge for a three pronged 12 volt plug from radio shack. 
Any words of wisdom?
