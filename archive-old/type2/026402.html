Subject: removable rear apron for later busses (was: Weird question)

Matthew Santori would like to equip his 78 Westy 'Blue' with a pre-71-style
removable rear apron. I'm seriously considering the same modification for
two reasons: (1) like you, to facilitate engine removal and (2) because my
rear apron needs to be modified anyway to accommodate the huge,
bratwurst-shaped muffler for my 911 engine.

Structural integrity is a serious concern, but to me this does not mean the
modification cannot be done, it only means it should be done right. Here is
how I plan to proceed (it's my best idea so far, but I cannot guarantee it's
good enough yet):
(1) support the engine with a trolley jack to prevent sagging while doing
the work.
(2) remove the bumper, remove hatch seal.
(3) from outside, cut the two seams at the two hatch corners, top to bottom,
just skin deep.
(4) cut 10-15 cm in front (front is front) of the seal lip from left corner
to right. Do the same from underneath.
(5) cut 10-15 cm in front (front is front) of the seal lip from right corner
to left. Do the same from underneath.
(6) cut back to front from inside end of cuts (4) and (5) towards engine
bay. 

The apron should now come off and you are left with a step cut and two
protrusions left and right, (from my measurements, the space between the
protrusions is still wide enough to pull the 911 engine. I need to
double-check whether it will also be wide enough for the T4) to which, I'd
weld a rear-facing plate each with two captive nuts each. These are the
flanges to which the apron can be bolted back on. It *might* also be wise to
reinforce the apron with some flat stock.

If anyone thinks this is a terrible idea, please step forward now... or
forever hold your peace :)

Btw, Bob, I'm in Alabama. We don't have no laws here. :)
