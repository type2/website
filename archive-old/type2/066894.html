For me, it'd be a multi-part trip.  First, back to Oregon, my (and my
bus's) home.  Then, I think it'd be Mexico, but the thing is it could
take weeks or months to get there from Oregon; the long way is usually
the best.  I've never been to the Grand Canyon either, and I'd have to
spend some time in the Sierras, of course.

Alaska would be nice too; maybe I could head up there in early June
and hang out for a few weeks until night falls... :)

Well, I'm graduating in May, so maybe that's just what I'll do; why
join Reality any sooner than necessary, right?
