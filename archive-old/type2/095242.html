Subject: Re: [T2] flat spot


Does the engine have a 009 distributor?  If so, I'd look into getting the 
proper vacuum advance model for your engine/vehicle.

&gt;Hi Volks my van has an annoying flat spot just off idle. The ignition and
&gt;carbs seem ok everywhere else. I have thought about altering the throttle 
&gt;gap
&gt;to try to eliminate it but which way should I go wider or narrower. I would
&gt;experiment with a C02 meter but I haven't one available!  The van is fitted
&gt;with solex 40 pdsit carbs it being a porsche 914/412 engine but the 
&gt;principle
&gt;is the same right? Any thoughts and or theories? TIA Mel
