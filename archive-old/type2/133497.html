&gt; &gt;heres' how I have done it.
&gt; &gt;. losen the tin that covers the cyl tops.  (take out the screws)
&gt; &gt;. get a 6inch or so extender and put a socket on that.
&gt; &gt;. work it under the tin and leave it there
&gt; &gt;. slide it sideways to get to the appropriate head bolts and use the
&gt; &gt;torque wrench as needed
&gt; &gt;. obviously you will need another socket for the head bolts under the
&gt; &gt;rockers.
&gt;
&gt; Did this work on an Type I engine?  After about 1/2 hour of

don't know I did it on a 2liter type IV engine
