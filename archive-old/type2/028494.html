Cheapest way is to get a 1 ft scientific glass thermometer for spot testing.
I have one that fits right in the dipstick tube perfectly.  Store it in its
protective tube.

Subject: [T2] Temperature Once Again

I will be making an 1100 mile run next weekend in my 74 Transporter (1800
w/1400 miles on rebuild, carb, manual tranny, synthetic oil). Going from
western Kentucky to Detroit on the super slabs; some hills but nothing
terribly steep. I do not have any temp guages, just the standard oil
pressure light on the dash.

Here's the question: What are some suggestions for judging engine temp while
en route? I'm familiar with the &quot;touch the dipstick&quot; method. Any other ideas
out there? I'd hate to burn up my new AVP long block! I'll be driving the
first leg at night, so that should help, but coming back will be daylight
driving all the way.

And, George, should I be worried about my P205's?

Thanks,
Dave
74 Transporter &quot;Rivka&quot;
