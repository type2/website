Jonathan-
No need to pull the engine to remove the heater boxes, but you will
need a &quot;blue book &quot; for the proper oem cuss words. ( personally,
i don't know a cuss word from Shinola :).
Forget the liquids penetrating oils, i use a torch ( not a flashlight )
and heat the nuts cherry red to remove and not break the studs
or pull them with the nuts rusted on, galling the aluminum heads
in the process.
Take a  long straight file across the top of the mounting flanges to true them.
Remove the old copper gaskets with a screwdriver and replace them.
I prefer to use new stainless nuts and anti-seize compound to install.
Any missing  or broken studs will need to be replaced, ( this can
be difficult if you are not careful ) Accuracy is the key to this job.
The technique depends on the situation.

Subject: [T2] Exhaust Leak
&gt;I recently reported a new noise emanating from my newly rebuilt '77 2.0
&gt;liter FI engine. A fellow listee suggested an exhaust leak, and recommended
&gt;stuffing a rag in the tailpipe to find the leak. Sure enough, by just
&gt;holding my hand over the tailpipe, I can force the exhaust out of the
&gt;leaking area. Unfortunately, I have not been able to pinpoint the leak, as
&gt;there seems to be excessive airflow all around the underside of the engine.
&gt;So my question is this: assuming the worst location for an exhaust leak -
&gt;where the exhaust manifold bolts on to the head - what will happen if I keep
&gt;running it without fixing the leak? I'm just getting ready to go camping and
&gt;don't want to pull the engine again just yet .Thanks in advance for all
&gt;advice.
&gt;
