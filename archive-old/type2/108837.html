Subject: Newbie questions

Hello all,
I'm new to the list and am overhauling my '77 2.0L Hi-Top bus (probably a
Get-Away Van conversion?) which I purchased 5 months ago.  I pulled the
gearbox and engine for &quot;just a&quot; clutch job and things have gone a bit
overboard.  The gearbox was baked and I couldn't find another 5-rib model
with a known history so I took mine to a retired VW transmission specialist
who kindly overhauled it for me.  I've also replace the shift rod bushings,
fork and shift lever gate plate.  Since the motor was burning oil I took it
apart too.  When trying to split my engine case I broke a piece off :'(  I
broke the lug on the top rear (non drive end) side of the case by the square
breather hole.  I should have known better, but live and learn.  Is it ok to
mig-weld this back on?  I'll have an leak otherwise, and it isn't a
structural defect.  Would JB weld be an acceptable option?  I'm pretty good
with a file and can dress out any imperfections.  Otherwise, I do have an
1800 short block as well...besides the difference in cylinder bores is there
any other differences that would prevent me from using my 2 litre crank and
other parts in the 1800 case, or is there more machine work required to use
it?  I have mechanical experience but I'm new to VW's and am definitely on
the learning curve.

Regards,
Drew
