&gt;Pencils, golf tees,?  I used to use a dowel sharpened to a taper,  All

&gt;I bought a gas line &quot;squeezer&quot; tool that ratchets and works about the
&gt;same as my vice=grip.

I use a little Dutch boy. His finger is just perfect for 7mm fuel hose and he even works for free so I can save my pencils and golf tees for those really high miniture golf scores I've been training for all winter long.

Seriously, proper fuel line clamps are worth every penny of the $4-8 they cost. Disclaimer: no tools were invented or mangled during the endorsement of this inexpensive specialty tool.
