Subject: cooling/air flow...the ultimate answer?



Folks, this came off of the vintagvw list and was found by dan at 
oceanstreetvideo_dot_com

http://www.offroadvw_dot_net/tech/wes/fan.html

Won't mean much for the t4 folks, but good for the t1 folks.

It also contains the formula that I kept trying to find when we
were trying to figure out if air flow with high humidity made for
a cooler engine over air flow with lower humidity.

I haven't looked it over too closely yet, but 
it looks very interesting.


Cheers ,dave
