Greetings and TIA,

My 75 Westy w/FI Doesn't want to drop her idle after acceleration. She also 
misses at higher RPMs. I did the soap tests to the air flow system and no 
apparent leaks. I'm thinking throttle switch. Am I close? would this account 
for the missing problem as well?

Mike 75 Westy &quot;Rancid Twinkie&quot; reborn and waiting to be renamed.
