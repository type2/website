Subject: Re: asbestos in VWs?

&gt;&gt;We believe that it is VW's responsibility to exchange the asbestos units
&gt;&gt;for non-asbestos units at
&gt;&gt;no cost to the VW owner. As long established owners of VW's we have
&gt;&gt;experienced success in
&gt;&gt;obtaining these units at no cost.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else ever heard about this?
&gt;Does this mean that if I call VWA, they'll provide me with NEW heat
&gt;exchangers?!  
&gt;Much too good to be true.  But who knows?

The piece in question is the seal that mates the front of the heat exchanger
hot air outlet to the black plastic accordian tube.  The older seals were
asbestos.  On both my '70 and '71 bus the asbestos seals were crumbling and
no doubt the fibers were traveling up the heat tube with the hot air.  The
rubber replacement seal is only a few $--buy one for each side and try not
to inhale the asbestos as you're cleaning off the residue :=|.  I just
replaced them at my cost--my feeling is that if I were to hold VW
accountable for every item on my 25 year old bus that is unsafe by today's
standards, I would probably decide not to drive a bus in the first place.
