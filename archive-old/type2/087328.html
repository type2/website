Subject: Corvair Gas heater in bus?

Anyone out there ever tried to put a Corvair gas heater in their bus?  Anyone advise for or against trying to do this??  P.S.  I'm leaving this afternoon to go pick up my &quot;new&quot; 65 Kombi from Kent, Ohio.  I'm sure I'll be back posting some questions about it tomorrow!



Peace, John Baker
