Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster gradually engages brakes

Bad booster ... I had the same problem. My brake pedal would not return all
the way and with each application of the brakes the problem got
progressively worse. One quick fix that worked for me to get home was to
pull over and release pressure from the brake system by shortly opening on
of the front bleeder screws.

Check for fluid inside the booster: pull the vacuum hose and see if there is
fluid inside by trying to siphon it out. Worked for me once. The other time
I had to replace the booster.

Hey all,

I've noticed a problem with my breaks, now that the break booster is hooked
up
again. As I'm driving, very gradually the breaks begin to apply. At first
it's not too noticeable. Then eventually the bus begins to slow down too
much
when I shift (it doesn't coast anymore). Soon the engine becomes noticeably
labored.
