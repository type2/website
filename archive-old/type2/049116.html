Subject: [T2] No more Blue Smoke...

Hey listees...
       To update: did a valve adjustment this morning...1/2 side was fine,
no major changes in clearance, all at .006...BUT the 3/4 side? OY!
All four valves were about .004!! Re-adjusted, keeping in mind I'm probably
dropping the seats (time to scramble a new head)...and cranked her up---no
more blue smoke! I've promised her only to drive to and from work, and to be
tender and kind:) meanwhile, time to get the extra engine put together POST
HASTE!!...Thanks to all who replied, all suggestions are being heeded and no
more highway driving!!
