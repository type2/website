Subject: Re: [T2] '69 engine into a '67 - engine tin

From: &quot;J Barry Burneskis&quot; 
 
 Does the '67 use the same engine tin as the '69??  Or can I trash the '69 
 engine tin?
 
 If the '67 engine tin is different from/than [any English teachers out 
 there??] the '69, would it be the same tin as the Beetles??  Or should I 
 have to ask that question on the vintagebus list??
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

All the tin is the same except the source of the heated air intake for the carb. 
67 came from the right side heater flapper valve. The hose to the air cleaner went 
thru the upper front tin. That is why the air cleaner snout has a 1&quot; hot air hose on the bottom of it.

Bay and bug engines get the heated air from the #2 cylinder thru a tube about 2&quot; in diameter.

#2 in the top pic, #2A in the lower.

Here is part of the 67 bus: http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/5867part/195.png
#50 is the 1&quot; tube, but the metal pipe pictured is not on a 67.

#37 here: http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/5867part/199.png
It says &quot; seal off carb pre-heating opening up to engine H 0 150 202&quot;
H 0 is 66-67 1500 bus engines.
1966 Chassis# 216 000 001 Engine# H 0 000 001 
1967 Chassis# 217 000 001 Engine# H 0 183 373 
#H 0 150 203 would be the 1st to start using the pre-heater tube on the flapper valve, 
sometime in the late 66 year model.
