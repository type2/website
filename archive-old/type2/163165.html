Subject: where to find pressure plate bolts?

Hi all,
As some wise folks on the list advised me the flywheel that came with my
1976 engine was too big to make a proper fit with the rest of my 1974 bus.
The engine used a 228mm flywheel and my bell housing wanted a 215mm.  I got
it the correct flywheel + pressure plate it wanted and a new clutch plate,
had the flywheel ground down real nice and I think I'm ready to go.  Now the
228's 8mm pressure plate bolts are too big for the 215mm flywheel and this
is where my question comes in:
I understand that the 215mm uses  6 hex head 7mm bolts but I'm not sure
where to get any that will be strong enough.  I'm assuming I need grade 8
steel but my local hardware store only has grade 5.  Any ideas?
also... is there only one size throwout baring for these pressure plates
from 72-79?
Thanks a bunch,
Steve in S. Jersey
