&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; From reading this dribble that apparently boost the ego's of those who
have
  more yard than sense, I have come to the conclusion that many of you
  essentially own junkyards.   &gt;&gt; Snip
 
 I agree.  To have for the sake of having is greed, outright, pure,
 unadulterated greed.  Not only that it is not even honorable greed it is
 foolish greed.  Get the cars, busses, you can afford, timewise and money
wise,
 to restore or at least preserve then let others who can restore or preserve
 them have the others.  That is the only way we will keep this hobby intact
for
 our grandchildren &gt;&gt;
   How can anyone come down on anyone for owning a bunch of VW's?  I've seen
all sorts of car fanatics collect cars, Triumphs, Chevies, or whatever.  When
you start dealing with older VW's especially (pre 60) or odd ball VW's
(411-412's) you have to pick them up in whatever condition and wherever you
can.  And because a VW is sitting in the backyard, it doesn't mean that it's
been forgotten about.  All my yard type VW's get power washed and aired out
constantly.  I am also always on the look out for the parts needed to start
and finish the project.  My 58' Kombi is such a bus.  I bought it 3 years ago
for the grand sum of $200.  This bus came out of Eastern Oregon hence it has
no rust!  The entire bus has 2 dents on it and is bone stock minus a frozen 40
hp.  Except for when I roll the bus,(the brakes where backed off as soon as I
got it home), the bus has pretty much been in the same spot for the last 3
years.  But the bus has gotten heavier.  It now has decent bumpers, wheel cyl.
kits for all brakes, roof rack, ladder, all the glass, emblem, and on and on.
When I finish my Ghia (btw it takes 3 Ghias to make one) the Kombi will roll
into the shop and roll out close to it's original glory.  It's taken a couple
of buses for parts to get what I needed for this project.  And yes I have made
money off of the parts I didn't use.  But the guy that walked away with those
rear fender panels for $40 bucks didn't complain one bit.  Or the kid today
that bought a complete bus head light for $20 because he couldn't find it
anywhere else, yea I did him a disservice.  
    As for preserving the hobby for our grandchildren, these backyard junk
yards or grave yards are a sanctuary for old VW's. The world is littered with
old buses behind barns and in backyards.  Would you rather have farmer John
haul that old ratty Bus to the scrap yard, like his wife wants, or store his
hay baler parts in it.  
   As for ego, owning 15 VW's is a gas!  Currently 8 are drivable and I keep 4
on the road at all times.  They all have there different uses and purposes.
But driving a safaried 57' single cab in the Oregon winter is a drag-but come
spring there is nothing in the world like it.  Ahhh...what the hell I only
drive it 7 months out of the year, so it's for sale-maybe someone from back
east where they salt the roads will buy it, or even better yet someone from
another country might meet my price.
Peace, Love, and seems to me their safer in my backyard,
     Mr. Bubble Head
I have a dream of retiring someday, and spending my golden years just
tinkering away on my old VW's.  What's so gawd awful about that!
