Subject: RE: [T2] master cyl leaking?

Billy, you said:

&gt;&gt;  My brake booster looks like it's been taking a bath
lately and it seems to be coming from a tiny &quot;hole&quot;
at the very bottom of the flange on the m.c. that bolts
to the booster.


Billy, the MC on my '72 has a tiny hole, exactly as you describe, and the 
brake fluid seemed to be draining out of it.

I could not imagine a how so tiny and so perfetly centerered on the bottom 
part of the MC flange, as the MC flange connects to the booster.

Can anyone describe if this hole is suppose to be there, what function it 
should play.

And, Billy, if you got a good explaination form any of the list members in 
p-mail, could you share that with me.

TIA

Barry sends
