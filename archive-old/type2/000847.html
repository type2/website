Shawn,

     What I did was drill &amp; tap a couple of 1/4&quot; x 2&quot; x 8&quot; flat bars.  I
drilled them 1/4&quot;-20.  Then I had a friend slide them up on the inside
between the airbox &amp; the front sheet metal.  I guided him until I could get
a 1/4&quot; hex head bolt through the bracket, front sheet metal &amp; into the flat
bar.  What this does is slightly distribute the load of the tire &amp; bracket
across a wider area.  It also allows you to bolt into something stronger
then thin sheet metal.  Any question drop me a line.

Subject: [T2] Front Spare Tire Mount


&gt; Volks:
&gt;
&gt; I found a front spare mount at a junk yard a few weeks back.  I was
&gt; trying to install it, but have no hardware.  It seems I need 1/4&quot; rivets
&gt; or sheet metal screw, neither of which can I find.  Any suggestions?
&gt; What did it originally come with.  I looked at some nylon anchors, but I
&gt; don't think they would hold a tire.
&gt;
&gt; thanks
