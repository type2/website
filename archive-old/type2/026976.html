Dear Jamie.

I was sorry to learn that you are again suffering problems, with connecting 
up your 1972-79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2 heat exchangers; in this case the Dansk 
Autopart, heater cable barrel nuts to which you referred.

I hope you have complained about about them to Dansk Autopart A/S, in 
Viborg, Denmark and the local supplier from whom you bought them.

Remember the maxix; &quot;Don't just grumble, complain!&quot;.

Regards.
            Nigel A. Skeet
