Subject: How Multi-vis Oils Work

I went back to check my memory and here's what I found:

&quot;Multi viscosity oils work like this: Polymers are added to a light base(5W,
10W, 20W), which prevent the oil from thinning as much as it warms up. At
cold temperatures the polymers are coiled up and allow the oil to flow as
their low numbers indicate. As the oil warms up the polymers begin to unwind
into long chains that prevent the oil from thinning as much as it normally
would. The result is that at 100 degrees C the oil has thinned only as much
as the higher viscosity number indicates. Another way of looking at
multi-vis oils is to think of a 20W-50 as a 20 weight oil that will not thin
more than a 50 weight would when hot.&quot;

This is a quote from an excellent sit ethat discusses and compares lots of
info on motor oils. Here's the URL:

Hope this helps.
