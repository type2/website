Subject: Would you like to see the Gilmore AC Install?

Ok group,

Here is a golden opportunity.  Im going to install the Gilmore AC
system into my 78 transporter in the near future, and I'll be
documenting the install for Ed _at_ Gilmore as well as for anyone else
that would like to see it.

However, I said to myself; Self, you have several acres (2ish) and a
decent shop (shack in the woods with tools) and a lavish autoshop
(tent and a floor jack) why not ask if anyone would like to witness
(help) with the install of this system?

Here's the offer.  I collect the names of those that would like to
attend the install, we collectivly decide on a date, and we all meet
at my place in MD.

I'd be able to offer water and power and a place to park your camper
for the weekend.  We'd gather on Friday and begin with the sun on Sat
morning, and in true &quot;Davids die hard&quot; fassion, continue until I
drop.  lol..

Hopefully by then I'll have the rear brakes worked out.

thoughts?

David.
