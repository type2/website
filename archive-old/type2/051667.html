Subject: [T2] 2bbl Carb

Happy Friday all.

Since I've decided not to cut up my Bus and make a dragster out of
it(kidding....), I guess I better put in a new clutch cable and get it to
where it will get more than NINE miles to the gallon.

Question:  This is a '76 2liter Fuel Injection motor with the blasted 2
barrel carb.  Admittedly I haven't looked for any numbers on it yet, but how
will I know if it is a Weber, or a cheep JCWhitney piece?

Years ago on my '72, I had the same setup.  I could only get a rebuild kit
from JCW.  My present carb has the same crooked square shapes on the top.

Why do (did?) people take off the dual carbs and fuel injection in favor of
a two barrel that gets bad gas mileage and suffers severly with carb ice?
Can I put the fuel injection back on?

Thanks in advance.

Mike
