&gt;#4 dead.

If number 3 is firing but number 4 isn't, and you are feeding both 
cylinders from a single carb, you can pretty much rule out the carb as the 
cause of the problem.  You have also verified compression.  The only thing 
left is spark.  You say you've swapped plug, wire, and cap, which are the 
only cylinder-specific parts.  That essentially rules out spark too.  So 
what is left?  Only some very improbable things, like:

The new spark plug or cap was also bad
Plug is somehow being grounded when installed
A/F supply is marginal for firing, barely enough for #3 but not for #4
Cap not fastened down properly
Valves opening at wrong time - broken cam?
You made a mistake somewhere

Here are some other wierd things you could try which may give you a clue to 
the problem, in no particular order:

Turn your dizzy 90 degrees and rotate your plug wires 90 degrees in the 
opposite direction.  Does #4 still not fire, or 1 or 3 (depending on which 
way you turned)?

Remove plugs and attach the plug wires.  Ground plugs against tin and turn 
over engine.  Is #4 spark plug sparking properly?  Compare spark of #4 to 
other plugs.

*Carefully*  drip some gasoline down the left carb throat while the engine 
is idling.  Does #4 begin firing?

&gt;With the plug fouling, I suspect dumping that
&gt;oily breather blowby directly into the carb port
&gt;may have fouled up the intake?  Any thoughts on
&gt;dieseling the carb as per Muir?

I seriously doubt that had anything to do with your problem.
