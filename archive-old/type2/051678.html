Subject: [T2] Welding / Vanagon side panel replacement

Until 3 years ago I had never welded. Did not even know what MIG etc meant.
Then my bus needed new rocker-panels. I had one side done by a garage and it
cost me about $200 for a very sloppy job. I then decided that I could
probably do a better job myself and went out and bought a cheap gasless
(flux core) welder. I figured that with the cost of the rcoker-panel (US$ 7)
I would be spending the same amount as when I had the welding done by
someone else. It was worth the risk. Remember I still had to learn how to
weld and I just learned along the way.

Well, the result was very encouraging. I soon realised however that using a
'real' MIG would give better results. So I sold the cheap unit (for $100,-)
and bought a semi profesional welder (about $600).

All in all I did not do a lot of welding, just small things. However about 2
months ago I got in touch with a person who had recently bought an '81 Westy
where the drivers side side-panel was completely rotted out due to leaky
utility inlets. Rockers and floor were virtually non existant. He planned on
replacing the lot with new metal and asked me if I could do the welding.
This seemed like a very large and complicated job to me. However it turned
out to be very doable and today I  welded in all the new stuff and it went
very well. I will shortly create a web page on this job. Until then you can
see my earlier work at http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/rocker.htm

Have fun,
