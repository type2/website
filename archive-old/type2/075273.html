Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

on 11/8/01 2:49 PM, you related:

&gt; Can you still get these new?  My local shop(80 miles away) says you they
&gt; are made any more.
&gt; 


i found one on ebay: they are getting difficult to impossible from regular
suppliers. the type 1 will work with a fairly simple modification.
aircooled_dot_net has a written up procedure for the mod on their page that
lists the type 1 thermostat.
