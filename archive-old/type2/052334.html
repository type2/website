 Fuel leaked by the valve seats in one or both carbs.  Could be caused by
an electric fuel pump left on or simply by gravity feed from the gas tank.

You need to change the oil and be sure that the engine can be turned over

primary wire from the coil, and crank the engine for 15 seconds or so.
Reconnect everything and fire it up.  Keep a big fire extinguisher handy
throughout this process!
