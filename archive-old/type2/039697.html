&gt;OK, I'll bite!  How often will a 90A (or even 45A) alternator truly see

I could see 90 amps being used up easily.  One thing most people forget to 
factor in is that the engine's ignition system takes a significant amount 
of power.  four spark plugs firing 2,000 times per minute (at 
4000rpm).  That's at least 5-10 amps right there.  Then you add radio, 
lights, fans, wipers, A/C (if applicable), CB radio, gauges... it all adds 
up.  Throw some monster amps in there and you could blow 90 amps right 
outta the water.

For the person who asked about the stock 72-79 alternator ratings, they are 
55 amp and 70 amp, with the 70 amp having a different case (O-shaped air 
duct instead of D-shaped).  You cannot simply swap one in place of the other.

My Mustang came with a 75 amp alternator.  I added an electric fan from a 
Lincoln Mark VIII in place of the stock, engine driven fan.  This fan is a 
beast, drawing an 80 amp surge at startup and 24 amps sustained.  This 
necessitated an alternator upgrade, which I did, to a 130 amp unit from a 
F-150 truck.  Without doing so I would have had problems for sure.  As 
others have said, you should keep your entire electrical system in mind 
when making modifications, and factor in the expense of upgrading related 
components and wiring when you make a change like wiring in a large 
stereo.  The electrical system is one of those things that can be a 
nightmare if modifications are not well thought out.

That's my zwei pfennig - froehliche wochenende!
