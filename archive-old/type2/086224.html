Subject: Heat Exchanger &quot;Rebuilding&quot;

Concerning the high temperature coatings, I have had good luck with one in 
particular.  I have tried several of the spray-on high heat coatings for 
manifolds on my T-1 and my motorcycle.  The only one that has really lived 
up to it's price is VHT brand.  The stuff goes on really thin and it dries 
looking powdery.  They recommend that you only do a few thin coats and not 
build it up much.  Then you are supposed to heat cure it.  On the T-1 
exhaust manifold I actually carefully followed the directions, and heated it 
up to about 500 degrees for a while, and then put it on and got it up to 
operating temperature.  DO NOT use your wife's (or your) oven for this!!!  
It works really well, but you will pay the price.  The stuff smokes up and 
stinks allot.  On the bike I just sprayed it, waited for it to dry, bolted 
it on and went.  both applications have stayed rust free and looked good for 
years.  They say it's impervious to everything, and I actually believe them, 
it's really tough stuff.  Probably not as good as sending it away to a pro, 
but allot easier on the wallet.

P.S. Thanks all for the help on the heating system diagrams.  The part 
diagrams at busted bus helped allot!
