I'm far from a purist.
paint it and modify it to your likings. You have to own it and drive it so  
you do what you do to enjoy it. Big motors, flowers, lowered or raised, a wing, 
 a bug welded on top what ever makes you happy. Don't make others happy it's 
your  ride cause when the repair bills come in they aren't going to give you 
one penny  cause you built it their way. It's yours enjoy it your way.
