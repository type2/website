&gt; i would  like to get the user opinions on converting from fuel
&gt; injection to  progressive carbs.  i have a 1978 transporter, 2000cc.
&gt; i am interested  in finding out if there are any advantages to fuel
&gt; injection over  carbs.   this is my very first bus and to be honest
&gt; the fuel  injection system is really intimidating.  as with carbs i
&gt; have a grasp  on the ins and outs. what should i do?
&gt;
&gt; If your FI system is working then leave it in place. You will get help from
&gt; this group if you start having problems an or how to maintain the FI.

agreed, when I got my 78 the FI system was a mystery, but it is not hard,
just different and once learned you'll wonder what is so hard about it,
once adjusted it rarely needs touching and the 2L engine was designed from
the beginning as a FI engine you will pull your hair out getting twin
carbs working right and they will never be as good as the FI it came with.

my feeling, if it came with carbs keep carbs, if it came with FI then keep
the FI
