Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tin screws

Please remember in your opinion.  GREEN Loctite works great for me.
Antisieze does not.  It is messy and turns to a sticky gooey substance when
it gets hot on those tin screws over the heat shield.

The main thing here is to do what works for YOU.  Don't act like others are
idiots for doing it another way.
