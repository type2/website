Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum source for power brakes

I don't think so.  The 71 was last year for upright, first for power 
brakes.  My carb (pict 36) is shot and will be when I replace it, 
probably with the 12 Ga in penance for all the hassle it's given me. 

I was wondering if the Kadron setup with balance tube taps would provide 
sufficient vacuum to run brakes.  I just now remembered that's what the 
setup's called (just woke up when I posted original)
