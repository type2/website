&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; One further observation that I would like to make...   I think I read
&gt;&gt; somewhere that a dissatisfied customer tells 7 people about his experience
&gt;&gt; and a satisfied customer tells nobody because he received what he expected.
&gt;&gt; This number must be multiplied by a factor of 100 (or more) on the internet.
&gt;&gt;

This is a good point and I truly hope that the power of the Internet has
Larry and others shaking in their boots.  However, why should I go out of
my way to tell seven friends that I got the product and it performed as
advertised?  In order for a customer to talk bad OR good of a company, they
need to receive non-standard service.  MOFOCO sent me a shipment of bad
parts once.  I sent them back along with a written explanation of the
problems (used parts sold as new, rebuilt parts that were out of specs,
etc.) and gave them a second chance.  They blew that second chance as well
a third and fourth.  As a result, I don't deal with MOFOCO and loudly
encourage others to do likewise.  RMMW messed up on a $.95 gasket once. 
When I called them, they were professional and apologetic and made the
order right with no fuss.  They also sent me a written apology as well as
two of their VW coffee mugs.  I now sing their praises.  GEX's replacing
heads while out of warranty is a great example of excellent customer
service but I suspect an ulterior motive.  Would GEX have replaced these
heads if there were not 300+ potential customers watching?  Honestly Larry,
would you have? If they only make the occasional mistake and acknowledge it
when they do, the &quot;Information Age&quot; will not be a threat to their business,
rather, it will be an asset.  However, I've found that with GEX, mistakes
seem to be the norm.  Of the three GEX engines I've installed here is the
score:

'73 squareback:  Basically a good motor.  When its 300mi valve adjustment
came up I discovered the rocker arms were filthy and the adjustment nuts
were rounded off.  Clearly they had not been disassembled for cleaning and
inspection 

'73 bus.  GEX sent the wrong engine.  Sent a '74 (not enough holes in its head).
RUDELY told me to send it back for exchange (any one care to guess how much
it costs to send an engine to and from Alaska?) I scrounged the parts from
a 74 and made it work.  Also had stripped exhaust studs and a mashed and
leaking (not due to shipping) valve cover.  It ran well though.  It made it
to California and as far as I've heard it is still doing well. 
 
'76 bus balanced 2.0L w/hyd lifters.  Ran wonderfully. Smoooooth, quiet and
powerful.  Lost all four exhaust seats in about 1100 miles.  Courteously
covered under warranty.  

Mostly these were minor problems but all are inexcusable.  GEX's sole
business is building VW engines and after having built tens of thousands of
them they should get it right.  If they would pay more attention to detail
they could sell a first rate product but it has been my experience that
they let flaws go unnoticed and, because of this, they are a company that
I'd rather not deal with. 

&gt;&gt; In the last 4 or 5 months since I've been following the lists there have
&gt;&gt; been about 3 or 4 problems that people have had with GEX products and I have
&gt;&gt; resolved each one.    In that amount of time GEX has sold over 1500 engines
&gt;&gt; and 3000 heads.   Where are these people ??   They must have received what
&gt;&gt; they expected.    It is important that we keep a balanced perspective.
&gt;&gt;

Ok, where are they (besides not on the net)?  Anybody out there have a GEX
engine they are delighted with?  Speak up.
