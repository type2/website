Subject: Re: [T2] New busser introducing himself and vacuum advance

You have a 31 on a DP intake?  Then this means you
have a reducing adapter between the carb and the

 As some had guessed, the distributor is Bosh 009
 indeed . There are two 
 other &quot;features&quot; that will need work:  the
 carburetor is solex 31 PICS (on a 
 1600 dp 1971) and the original air filter is gone,
 replaced by some &quot;high 
 performance&quot; paper junk. Bastardizing ? Maybe
