&gt;Hi all
&gt;My 74 type 4 engine has developed a crack in the tubes that go into the
&gt;head, from the air pump.
&gt;The 1-2 side has 1 tube in each cylinder, the 3-4 side has only 1 tube .
&gt;
&gt;As the pump is long gone and the cracks now leak exhaust into the engine
&gt;bay,, I wanted to repair them.
&gt;I was told to just pinch them off as they are not needed

They are not needed, and you can pinch them off if you want, but that's
really not the right way to do it.  You can remove the pipes from the heads
and plug the holes with the appropriate bolts.  Allen head bolts would be
good since space is tight in that area.  Take the tubes to the hardware
store to find bolts of the same length and thread.  Use lock washers or
they will come loose.  In fact, I would use a dab of loctite on the threads
of each bolt.

Another solution is to take the tube out that is cracked and get it welded.

&gt;Will it be detrimental to the fuel mixture or anything?

No.  The fuel mixture has already been burned by the time it gets to those
tubes.
