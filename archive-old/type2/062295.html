Subject: Re: 87 octane? not what i heard

&gt;here goes the debate again, i've read here to use 87 octane everytime, but i've
&gt;been told to run nothing but premium which is supposed to be better for the
&gt;engine. what's the real truth?
&gt;

Who told you?  I've been running very fine on normal 87 octane.  All I've
ever used is 87 octane.  And if I use higher octane (which I've done a
coupla times for comparison) I find no difference in performance or
mileage.  So I see no reason to use high octane gas.  Dissent?
