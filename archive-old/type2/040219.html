Subject: battery disconnects

Just got back from the Dayton, Ohio amateur radio convention, and I 
found a great source for those nifty battery isolation switches that 
are so handy for completely removing the battery from the electrical 
system of your prized VW during long unattended parking sessions.

This is the heavy adapter that is affixed to the + terminal on the 
battery, and then the main feed wire is, in turn, connected to the 
opposite side of the switch. The isolation is achieved by simply 
unscrewing a large bolt built into the switch assembly. It has a large 
plastic knob to allow easy actions.

These guys were being sold for $3.00 each, or two for $5.00.
I thought it was a great find!

The outfit that had them was.
