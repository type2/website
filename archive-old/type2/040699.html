Subject: Re: New AVP engine &amp; pushrod tube

Jarrett,

     From the picture, I do not think the dent is anything to worry about.
It does not look deep enough to touch the pushrod &amp; unless it is actually
pushed over to one side or another the sealing surfaces are not affected.
Try to look at it from a end view &amp; see if the tube looks pushed over to one
side.  Of course it is your engine &amp; time involved here.  If you do not feel
comfortable with the dent then give AVP a call.  If it was my engine it
would go in just as it is.
