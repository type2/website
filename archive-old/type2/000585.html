Subject: Honda motor into my 71?
Date: Mon, 16 Oct 2000 21:31:46 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

It's a sort of long term pipe dream, but I have an old Honda Civic in my
garage that's about dead, maybe. Rusty frame members, creeping rust
everywhere else.  It's got a 1.6 L in it, with AC, and it runs like a clock.
The Kennedy brochure I've got, if I remember correctly, says the Honda
motors rotate the wrong way.  I'm too lazy to dig the brochure out and check
and besides, I'd like it know:  any listees out there have any knowledge of
this motor in a bus?  Much as I love keeping my fire extinguisher up to
date, it sure is tempting to think of having heat, much less AC, in my bus.
Comments?
