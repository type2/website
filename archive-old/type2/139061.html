&gt; So I really like the look of the Monza style exhaust, twin tips,  but
&gt; I'm searching for &quot;the one&quot; to go on my upcoming Boston Bob 2L for my
&gt; '73. Anyone got a line on where I can source a good monza style exhaust
&gt; ? I am going to be keeping my stock '73 HE's.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks !

You are sure to get lots of opinions on this question. I will tell you mine:

Don't do it. The monza style exhaust currently available for your
application is crap, plain and simple. The muffler bodies are made of
paper-thin steel, the fit is poor, the welding sucks, the finish is a joke.
It will rust and fall off before you know it. I used the monza style
personally a few years ago and I have witnessed a few others. I have never
seen or heard of one that lasted any reasonable time without disintegrating.
YMMV, but I doubt it.

If you want a bit better flow than the stock muffler, use an extractor and
single quiet muffler. It won't look like the monza unit, but it won't fall
off in a year either.
