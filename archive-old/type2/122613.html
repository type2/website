&gt; The first is a little rubber elbow. I tried to find it in the Bently. If you
&gt; look at page 29 in the FI section I believe it is the elbow that plugs onto
&gt; the Auxiliary air regulator. The other end of the elbow has a hose in it
&gt; that attaches to the rubber boot that is attached to the air intake sensor.

elbow, 022-129-637, sold at all fine VW vendors.

plastic Y, 022-133-215A, ditto.

&gt; Also, is there some trick to taking it off and putting a new one on. Mine
&gt; seems to be stuck on the aux air regulator.

A good seal! You want that. ;-) Try pushing it on more before taking it off
to break it's grip.
 
&gt; The other part I am looking for is exhaust gaskets.  I need the ones from
&gt; the heater boxes to the heads (kind of oval shaped with a hole at either
&gt; end.) and the ones from the heat exchangers to the crossover pipe (in this
&gt; case muffler since I switched to the earlier one piece muffler to avoid
&gt; buying a cat.) These are trapezoid shaped.  I'm tired of loosing power to
&gt; exhaust leaks (especially at the heads) So I really want something that will
&gt; last. Also, anyone have any experience with the mr gasket stuff or a similar
&gt; product?

All the exhaust part numbers are here:
