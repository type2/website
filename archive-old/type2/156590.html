Subject: RE: [T2] Re: 1972 Bus, work in progress

I have a bunch of parts for a different type of A/C system. I don't know if it's original or not but I found it on a Camper Bus in the junkyard several years ago. It fits directly underneath the dash board. It has the EXACT same material and in the exact same color as the dash. It's that matte crinkle finish. The knobs, fans, all that stuff also match the stock VW stuff.

Anyway, the ONLY thing I have is that unit (which contains the fans and electronics) and the A/C compressor (which appears to be a BOSCH). Would you happen to have the evaporator / condensor? (or whatever that huge radiator thing is?)

If you have any of that stuff, I'd be really interested...


Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt;I'm wondering if my stuff could be of use for anyone - like for this 72 or
&gt;anyone that wants to try and get AC working - I'm running out of room for VW
&gt;junk - I mean stuff.
