 IV)

2.7 was supposed to be the worst of the 911 engines. Sort of a factory bore 
and stroke on a Type I engine. I think after this they began beefing up the 
block and such - sort of like a type IV design versus a Type I.

The earlier (smaller) sizes were okay because they weren't so stressed, and 
the bigger engines were okay because the factory resolved several issues 
that appeared in the 2.7 liter.

Now if you want cheap power go with a 2.7 liter Corvair 110 HP. It's easy 
to build 200 HP into one but beware - all these old aircooled  engines VW, 
Corvair, Porsche are getting expensive.

Why not shoot for 100 HP out of a Type IV and enjoy the scenery? I know.. 
me neither. MORE POWER!!!
