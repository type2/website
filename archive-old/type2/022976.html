Hello all,

I am looking for a little info for someone who has been around VW's longer 
then I.  I have a 1970 Kombi with a 1600 dp.  Is there any difference in 
the plug wires, cap and rotor from a 1600 in a bug?  Oh yea I have a 009 
dizzy (which I can not understand how to time for the life of me.)  I am 
asking because a friend has a set of wires, a cap and rotor that he bought 
for his bug, but never installed, and if I can use them I can have them.


Thanks in advance,
Mike
