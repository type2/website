&gt;      Hello all,  I've decided to switch to an alternator on my rebuilt 1600.  Will my stock generator stand work?  I've heard or read something that an alternator will not fit without modification.  Or that it will hit the fuel pump or carb.  What's the real deal.
&gt;  Thanks,  Marcus

It won't work at all.  The end of the alternator is larger in diameter
than the generator and the stand has to be made with clearance for this.
Luckily, such stands were common in late model beetles, so getting one
isn't all that hard.  I recommend a used VW OEM stand over an aftermarket
item.
