Subject: thats the brakes

Hello all:
    While I am re-doing the drive train on my camper, I thought I'd try to
figure out what is up with my brakes too. Here is the scoop: One crummy
January day, one of my rear brake cylinders failed. With the weather being
cold and wet and the bus being half a block away from a brake &quot;specialist&quot; I
decided to let them take care of the problem. The end result was that I
&quot;needed&quot; new brake drums, backing plates, brake shoes and cylinders for my
rear wheels. No problem, I was going to do all that anyway at some point.
So, within three weeks of the &quot;repair&quot; the bus is back in the shop because
after a moderate drive 20 min the drums are so hot water boils away when
sprinkled on them. Apparently they were adjusted too tight. A couple of
weeks later, the same thing happens, back to the shop. Finally, with eight
days to go on the parts warranty the right rear brake cyinder goes out
again. I take the bus back and demand they do it right, refund my money or
pay to have it fixed elsewhere. They of course choose door # 1 and fix it
themselves (stupid me). The brakes are still hot after a drive only not as
bad as they were. Looking the  parts over I noticed the backing plates have
the bracket which holds the adjusting screws set at an angle whereas my
originals (if I remember correctly) were straight. Could this be the
problem? What are the compatibility issues if any between rear brake shoes,
drums and backing plates? If I have drums for a 69, shoes for a 69 and
backing plates for a later year, is there any way to resolve this without
buying another set of backing plates, drums or shoes?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
TIA,
Jeff Mitchell
