Subject: 2002 Canadian Shows?

Hi Volks,

I am starting to plan this summer's weekend get aways.  To the delight
of my wife, I usually plan our trips with the 72 Westy around a couple
of VW shows.  Seriously she is very supportive of my addiction and
enjoys the shows almost as much as I do.

That being said, anyone know of a site with a list of all the 2002
Canadian shows or for that matter shows within a 4-6 ride at 50-55 from
Ottawa, Ontario?

Thanks

Craig
Norman 1972 Westy

PS Any other Ottawa volks out there?
