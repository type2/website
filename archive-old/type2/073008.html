&gt;Everyone has a rant, be it tickets, insurance, speed limits,
&gt;what have you...

I'd lobby for lower speed limits, on the freeways and interstates at any
rate.  Look: It'd be more environmentally friendly, save gas, people's cars
would last longer, and it'd save lives and injury.

OK.  I'll admit it.  I'm tired of being blown off the road, tail-gaited,
and nearly rear-ended while out for a camping trip with my family.
Anything over 90 km/h (55 mph) is faster I need to go to get anywhere.  But
hey, maybe I'm just really mellow...

The corollary is I think police should ticket idiots who drive in the fast
lane all the time, regardless of their speed relative to others on the
road.  Blocks up the fast lane, puts more pressure on us slow pokes.  Both
this and above beef are a real issue for me as a Type2 driver.

Finally, (not really type2 specific, sorry) I think drivers who don't pull
over for emergency vehicles should be heavily fined and forced to drive
Ladas or Trebants for the rest of their lives.  I propose running an
ambulance around with the lights on, and a pack of police cars behind
stopping anyone who doesn't pull over for the ambulance, giving out them
tickets and unloading the Ladas on the spot.
