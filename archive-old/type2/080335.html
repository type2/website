Subject: Re: [T2] Old Paint (longish)

I've used about a half a dozen products over the years to attack old paint. 
I used one product called color-back I think on my '65 Beetle while I was 
living in Italy. Wonderful job. Lasted a few weeks. Each time I brought the 
shine back it faded faster.

Just my experience.

Check with some of the paint suppliers or body shops. Maybe they can help 
resurrect your paint or give you estimates on new paint.

Materials for my Acrylic Enamel + hardner (economy quality materials) was 
something like $350-$400 a couple of years ago. Used some metal impregnated 
body filler, a gallon of epoxy high build primer, water based sealer, a 
couple gallons of red and one partial gallon of white. Holding up well-will 
need more attention I suspect in another 5 or 6 years.

Hang in there.
