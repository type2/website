Duncan,

You can use either transmission in either year bus - as long as you use
the proper flywheel/clutch/bellhousing combo. In my 74, I have now
installed the 76-79 tranny with a 74 bellhousing/clutch/flywheel combo.

Apparently, the ribs are shaped differently (pyramid shape) on some 002
trannies. Supposedly, this coincides with a taller final drive (or
fourth gear?) gearing resulting in a ratio that is somewhere between a
&quot;normal&quot; 002 and the later 091.

Which transmission you want is up to you. If you are concerned about
pick up and ability to tow heavy loads, use an 002. If you want lower
RPMs at highway speeds, go with the 091. 

If your bus does not like to go faster than 65 anyway, stay with a 002.
I opted for the 091 because my engine is a modified 2L and I wanted
lower RPMs when cruising at 80 mph. If you are running the stock '72
1700 engine, stay with the 002 - I do not think that your engine would
have enough torque to make the 091 enjoyable.

Hope this helps. Feel free to p-mail me if you have more tranny swap
related questions.

Marcus

.

So, What I understand is that there are two type IV
trannys, 72-5 and 76-9. The difference being the bell
housing and flywheel/clutch assembly. There was also a
commment about my transmission being one year only?
(pyramid shaped. . . Im not sure I understand, as it
looks like a Volkswagen transmission when I look at
it, not a pyramid).  Is the one year only due to the
gearing ratio, thus making it an internal difference
(so it would still work with the 72 motor)? What does
this mean for my bus?
