Resolve all issues with the battery and ground cables and the terminals
from switch to starter first. If that is all in good order and providing at
least 9.5 volts to the starter while cranking, then your symptom is also
many times caused by an old starter that should be replaced.

By all means, verify that the battery is resting in the morning at at least
12.6 volts. If not, you have a battery on it's downward slope to failure at
first frost and low amps trying to start with an old starter when warm,
which adds resistance as well. 

The relay is a work around the poor connections and system weaknesses. The
kit from Bosch has complete hardware and instructions for installation and
is not at all expensive, $15 to $20.

&gt;We are having starting problems after engine has been warmed up, and then
&gt;shut down. It turns over very slowly. It's a new 1600 dual port with
+ACo-just
&gt;installed+ACo- electronic ignition.
&gt;
&gt;Does any one have the instructions for installing the hot start relay?
