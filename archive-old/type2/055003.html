    Neats foot oil is skin oil from &quot;neat&quot; cattle. I'm not sure just
    what a neat cow is--maybe they clean their rooms without being told
    to? Anyway, that's what it is.

well, the web says

neat
Pronounced: neet
Inflected Form(s): plural neat or neats
Etymology: Middle English neet, from Old English nEat; akin to Old High
German nOz head of cattle, Old English nEotan to make use of,
Lithuanian nauda use
Date: before 12th century
: the common domestic bovine (Bos taurus)

but so far as I know (relative in the business) the
neat's foot oil is largely from unborn calves found
at slaughter of the cow, i.e., the same ones from
which &quot;slunk&quot; comes (where slunk is a lovely and
very fine leather from which many handbags are made)

note that &quot;neats' foot oil compound&quot; is not the sam
as &quot;pure neats' foot oil&quot; in that the compound is
made not by boiling the hooves (and bones -- marrow
grease is made at the same time) but by acid extraction
and is less durable, chemically speaking.
