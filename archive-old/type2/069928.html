Subject: Spiral Bound your Bently's

Last weekend when I was working on my bus I abused my Bently's one too many
times and tore the pages loose from the binding.  I'm sure this is common
knowledge to the list but I'm going to tell it anyways...

My wife took the manual to Kinko's and they spiral bound it with a hard
plastic spine for only $1.60.  The manual is now more useable than when it
was new because I can lay it flat and it stays down.  I've now done this to
my Haynes and may just go spiral bound slap-happy and do my whole library.
 Give it a try, it's cheap to do and you'll love the results.
