Every one of my cars have VDO gauges...Oil tempp&amp;pressure, and cylinder head
temp, at the least....Never see any wild variations with them..

&gt; &gt;Ok..if the general consensus is that the VDO gauges are inaccurate, then
are
&gt; &gt;there any better solutions (without investing a small fortune) or are
they
&gt; &gt;just par for the course?
&gt;
&gt; How did that get to be the general concensus?  My VDO gauges are within a
&gt; few percent of accurate and I have almost a dozen of them in my bus
&gt; (counting the factory ones).  Does anyone really think that VDO would
still
&gt; be in business after (guessing) 30 years if all of their gauges were off
by
&gt; a huge amount?  There will always be the occasional lemons as with
anything
&gt; that is mass produced, but VDO is a quality gauge.  Way ahead of the
cheapo
&gt; stuff you find at the local FLAPS.
&gt;
&gt; If you still don't want to buy VDO, try Autometer.  They have a good
&gt; reputation in the racing world.
