&gt; I had heard a rumour that the Japanese were required to replace 
&gt;engines at some 30,000 miles and the old ones are of course imported
&gt;to the USA and you'll see ads in your local papers about them.
&gt;Just Rumour.

My brother bought a cheap low-mileage Nissan engine in California that was 
(according to the company that sold it to him) imported from Japan due to 
some sort of Japanese law (the above, I guess).  There does indeed seem to 
be an abundance of low-mileage Japanese engines on the West coast.  Too bad 
they don't fit Volkswagens. (Well, maybe a Subaru flat-four?...)
