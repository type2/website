&gt;GEX is the obvious one, but there are a lot of crate
&gt;engine builders out there that are equally bad.  I'm not a type iv guy,
&gt;but it seems that the best alternative is to find a local rebuilder of
&gt;good reputation and not-so-cheap prices.  

This is from a lurking,  Chicago &quot;wanna - '78,'79 Westy - busser&quot; who's
taking more than 6 months reading up and learning.  Looking through the ads
in the 2 major VW mags, few if any local rebuilders are near Chicago.
Anyone with suggestions?  At a recent bugfest in a Crystal Lake, IL, several
T2 owners recommended rebuilds from Fast German Autos.  What's the group's
consensus?  Also, I'm currently reading the John Muir book.  I like it, tho
I have some quesitons which will wait until they relate to my future bus.
