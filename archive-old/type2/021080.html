Subject: funny bolt tricks-using cutoff disks

&quot;back&quot;- you mean more inaccessible?  Get the rear wheel off the ground
and you can rotate the wheel to make a bolt accessible.  A fiber cutoff
disk on a dremyl tool is good for the cutting/relieving; they now have a
right angle gear attachment so you can get in tighter spots.  Looks like
a miniversion of a Plumber'sw drill!  DON'T get the breakable
non-reinforced disks or the expensive Dremyl smaller fiber disks, ENKAY
makes a 1.5&quot; wheel, sold in any Woodworker's Warehouse store.  I use
these constantly in my musical instrument support manufacture.

&gt; area of the bolt to the CV until I could easily twist it out with vise
