Subject: Engine Hatch Hinges

 Hi All. I'm finally back on the list after being booted due to server
probs. I took a break
from the computer too.
I have been doing some painting on the 73 Westy, The right hand panel behind
the slider door and the engine hatch.
I removed the sliding door mech. and cleaned and painted and lubed it last
month. I've been waiting to do some body and paint work before reinstalling
it.
The engine hatch hinges are very worn and i wonder if any one has rebuilt
theirs? Knock out the pin, drill oversize and
install a larger roll pin? Might be tough to keep the drill straight.
Anyone have some for sale with little wear?

Thanks in Advance.
Its good to be back!
