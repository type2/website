Subject: Re: [T2] Stinky heat

I recently had an experience which fouled up my heat, maybe this is part
of your problem.  A few weeks ago, I set out to adjust my valves
(clackety-clack).  The bus was parked on an angle, and when I removed the
valve cover, oil came pouring out.  At that point I realized there was a
hole in the top of my heat exchanger, allowing oil to pour _inside_ the
heat exchanger.  D'oh!  I don't know if this hole is standard or if it is
the result of rust, but man, you talk about your stinky heat... burning
oil fumes are no fun.  Guess the VW engineers never anticipated that one.

So, in short, there may be oil that has leaked into your heat exchanger,
that hasn't fully burned away, that is making your heat miserable.

This morning, I finally disconnected the heater hose under the bus, so
that I could tape it shut (the heater box doesn't seem to fully close and
can't effectively block the fumes).  Being in Berkeley, heat isn't too
critical.  I'm hoping the oil burns away in a few weeks, then I'll
reinstall the heater tube.  Looks like now is the time to do that asbestos
abatement.

Richard, you mentioned that you found the &quot;missing plate that joins the
heat exchanger to the fan shroud&quot;.  Where did you locate this part?  I've
been searching, too, and right now am using the ol' duct tape solution.
