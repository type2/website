Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;

We'll never know - he sold it he wrote on the site.

&gt;Does anybody have any knoledge of or experience with
&gt;those high temp ceramic exhasut coatings. Would that be
&gt;safe to use on heat exchangers? Also, wouldn't some sort
&gt;of coating such as cermaic of Por-15 make it &quot;safer&quot; to
&gt;use the fiberglass wrap?
&gt;The guy that did the Rust, noise and heat website swore
&gt;by the wrap, wonder how the boxes on that bus are
&gt;holding up.

I'd like to hear the answer on the coatings please. I had wondered about that.
