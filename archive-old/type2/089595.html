Subject: Things for Kids in Jerome?

As I prepare to go to my first Jerome visit, I am wondering if there are
things for children to do there.  I have three daughters and a son ages
7,5,3, and 1.  My wife has graciously agreed that if there isn't really
anything kid friendly to do there that I can go alone.

I appreciate any public or private replies.

Thanks,

--kevin--
