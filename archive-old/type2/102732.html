Subject: Roof Racks

Hi,
If you want to mount a thule rack on your Westfalia the only way to do it is to drill in the artifical gutter into your pop top.  The advantage would be you can pop your top with the rack installed.  Or if you don't want to drill Just buy the Yakima 1A HIGH Rise Towers not the thule these go almost straight up  and you will not need to grind down anything. I do have about five of these new that I could sell cheap to list members if anyone was interested pmail me. 
Good Luck

Just bought a Thule Superhigh Foot pack and 65&quot; bars for my 79 Westy.  My problem...the inner edge of the feet contact/interfere with the sides of the 
poptop.  Now I'm thinking I need to grind away some of the material on the 
inner edge of the feet to provide some clearance and allow the feet to sit 
in the gutters.
