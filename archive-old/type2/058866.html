Subject: Re: Sender Wiring: Over or Under?

&gt;&gt;Also, a related question:  I'll be mounting the sender in the sump
&gt;&gt;plate.  When reattaching the sump plate, do the two bolts need 
&gt;&gt;to be tightened to a specific torque -- as with the oil strainer bolt

&gt;For the love of God, whatever you do, tighten those S.O.B.s 
&gt;*really* carefully!  I installed such a sender a little over a year
&gt;ago, but didn't tighten them enough and had the little copper washers
&gt;break on me.  
...
I don't know what the torque spec is, but it ain't much!  Those damned
sump plates are notorious for leaking to begin with, but the ones tapped
for temp senders are worse for some reason.  

I was able to recover from my stipping of the holes by using slightly
longer bolts.  The case was apparently tapped deeper than the bolts
required.  And besides, the 914 sump plate I used was slightly thicker
than the original anyway (that's probably why my bolts stripped in the
first place).
