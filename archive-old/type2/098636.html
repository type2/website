  Salem Imports

Mark at Salem Imports in Roanoke, Virginia is picking up the sick bus on Saturday. 
Mark is the supreme team player, cool dude extraordanaire in the world of VW breakdowns. He helped me out greatly, along with Jeff Burkes after Everybus last year. I would encourage everyone on the East Coast to stick Marks phone number in their wallet or glove compartment.
Thanks to Mark for helping out a VW brother. Happy Thanksgiving to all.
Peace,
Maui Haui
