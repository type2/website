&gt; I am considering installing a spin on oil filter for my 71 Westy. 
Does anyone have any recommendations?  Should I also consider a remote
oil cooler?  I would like to remove the screen from my sump plate so I
won't have to remove it during oil changes (studs are in bad shape).

Use a cast iron (not aluminum) oil pump cover with oil port, plug the
internal oil passage, and tap the case for the return line.  Use a
Fram HP1 filter, as it's the only one that will take the pressure. 
Mount the filter bracket so that the filter screws on open-end-up, so
that you can fill the filter with oil before you start the engine. 
Use large hoses and short runs to minimize pressure loss.

The doghouse cooler is adequate for a stock engine with a cooling
system in good shape.  Put your effort into making sure all the tin
and seals are installed correctly.

Don't omit the screen.  Instead, fix the studs and install the plate
with the proper acorn nuts so that the studs don't get messed up
again. You really need not remove the screen every oil change, as
there is little chance that a significant quantity of material big
enough to get caught in the screen will be present to clog it up. 
It's really there to stop an errant chunk of metal (say, from a
pistion skirt) from seizing the oil pump and destroying the engine. 
Checking the screen now and then (say 10,000 miles) is a good idea,
but the screen really isn't a filter.
