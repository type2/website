Subject: '70 Bus: Asbestos in Firewall or Heater Boxes?

Hi Bus Fans--

I'm getting to know my newly-purchased '70 bus better, and I am wondering
about the material mounted on the ceiling of the engine compartment. It is
black, and appears to be fibrous. It appears to be crumbling in one area. Is
this asbestos?

I've also read a lot of type2 archives material about asbestos in heater
boxes, but have been unable to conclude whether this applies to model years
before 1972.  I would imagine it would, but does anyone know for sure if the
1970 heater boxes contain/are connected to asbestos material? (Currently my
heating system is disconnected, but I was thinking of hooking it back up.)

After reading in the archives, I'm not paranoid about it...but I'd like to
know what I'm looking at!

Thanks,
