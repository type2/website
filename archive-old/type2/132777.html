&gt;be able to get any kind of toolbox on the airplane.  I work as an

I had an experience recently in August when I flew to NC to drive a friend's
bus to a few Dead shows.  Went to the airport with a full set of combo
wrenches wrapped in a towel and packed in my carry on, no dice, but I was

lucky.

May be easier to ship a box ahead (insured of course).

be sure to send a trip report!! good luck,
