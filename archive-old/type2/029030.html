When getting a second hand flywheel, be sure to check for cracks in the metal of the flywheel. Severe heat can cause these cracks. Then, under the force of rotation, once installed on the engine (and while you're tooling down the road at top speed - 65 ;), the flywheel can explode into many pieces.

The cracks are very small, but can be seen with the nekid eye (or glasses if you're far-sighted). Look on the clutch side of the flywheel.

Thanks! Joe
