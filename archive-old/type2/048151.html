Subject: [T2] seeking westphalia plaid mattress cover

Greetings all,

I am seeking top or bottom cushion covers in good shape in the &quot;Brown, Tan, 
Green, Black&quot; pattern found in the &quot;Mexico Beige&quot; 79 Westphalia conversions.  

I am willing to purchase them or can trade a nice top mattress cover in the 
74 westphalia &quot;Green, Blue&quot; plaid pattern or a rear hatch mosquito screen.
