Subject: Re: Clutch adjustment on a '74

 
&gt; Is there away to adjust the clutch linkage or cable?  My clutch is
&gt; engaging pretty low, only about an inch or so off the floor.  Plus, there
&gt; is about two inches of free play at the top of the pedal.  It seems like
&gt; there should be a way to &quot;shorten&quot; the cable by way of adjusting it, to
&gt; take up the slack and move the engagement spot up a bit.  Is there?  It's
&gt; been raining non-stop for days, so I haven't really looked under the bus,
&gt; but the next clear day after today I'm going to check it out.
&gt; 
&gt; I put a new clutch in just over a year ago, so that's not the problem, I'm
&gt; pretty sure I just need to compensate for wear.

The clutch cable attaches to a lever on the upper lefthand side (looking 
forward) of the gearbox bellhousing.  The cable has a threaded end which 
passes through an eye in the lever and is held by a wing nut.  Use the 
wing nut to adjust the clutch freeplay - you should have about an inch of 
throw in the pedal before you feel some resistance.  I like to completely 
loosen the cable off by turning the wing nut right back then turn it in 
slowly with a helper at the pedal measuring the freeplay.

As a clutch disk wares thinner shouldn't the freeplay decrease?
