&lt;&lt; FYI, I bought some Mark Stephens heads too, and the combustion chamber
 volumes vary by up to 1 cc.  I thought this was a problem, Mark Stephens
 said it was not important and not to worry about it.  Well, maybe it is,
 and maybe it isn't, but I *am* going to worry about it.  I'm going to
 polish the combustion chambers and round off all the sharp edges (including
 the edge of the combustion chamber itself) and then CC them again and take
 off material until they are all as close as possible.  This will probably
 void my warranty but I don't really care about that - I have a low opinion
 of the value of most warranties.  Opinions on the above welcomed. &gt;&gt;

i agree with you on the supposed *warranties* that come with rebuilt products.
i am sure most companies are gonna ask you to prove it was their part that
went bad and not your installation of it or whatever other reason they come up
with to not give you new set of heasds or whatever it is you bought.  i would
be interested to hear real stories of some companies who do have a good return
policy.  the only one for me is gene berg....i have returned some items (
altho not defective ) with no questions asked.  how about rocky mountain
motorworks they claim *lifetime warranty*...anyone have success returning
failed parts there??????????hhmmmmmm
