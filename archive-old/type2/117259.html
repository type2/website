Subject: Re: [T2] the mechanic's full notes on Alice

&gt; order out of sequence, distributor cap 180 degrees out of position, wiring
&gt; to mixture control solenoid was wrong. Corrected firing order, repositioned
&gt; distributor cap.

Apparently this guy knows little about VWs...for instance, the cap won't
go on 180 off.  Sure it could be /wired/ 180 off...but that sure isn't
what he said.


&gt; Vehicle would start but not idle for very long. Checked manifold vacuum, it
&gt; was 7-8lbs. Tried adjusting timing to bring idle up to normal, but it had no
&gt; significant effect on vacuum. Removed valve covers to check valve

He has an interesting theory here about setting ignition timing by
checking vaccum.  Is he checking this below or above the throttle plate, I
wonder.... (not that it matters, timing should be set by...well...timing.)

&gt; Adjusted all valves, (to where it ran best, don't know wether this engine
&gt; has short studs or long studs), reinstalled valve covers.

&quot;to where it ran best&quot; eh?  Sounds like he's working on an overhead
valvecover engine that you can /run/ while you adjust the valves...Maybe
he got your notes mixed up with his old Chevy?

And, of course, he forgot to read the proceedure about finding out if the
engine has long or short studs, too, didn't he.  He also failed to pay any
attention to what engines that applies too...  Did he ever mention to what
spec he adjusted them to?  Or just to &quot;where it ran best&quot;?   Since it runs
like shit, I'd say he didn't get there.


&gt; Restarted vehicle. Dwell was at 56 degrees and timing off. Reset dwell and
&gt; timing, vehicle ran better but still had low manifold vacuum. (13#). At
&gt; proper timing has 3# of manifold vacuum.

Oooh, so he set &quot;reset&quot; the timing, but no mention of what he set it to.
(degrees of engine rotation after or before TDC)


&gt; Played with timing to get best running. With distributor set to end of its
&gt; movement, we got 15# of vacuum with the needle bouncing between 13-15lbs.

Back he goes to using engine vacuum to check the timing.   Innnteresting.


&gt; Checked emissions, found CO wandered from .04% to .56%. HC, depending upon
&gt; carb adjustment, would wander from 400PPM to 3200PPM, but would also hunt.

Now, is this with the timing &quot;set to the end of its movement&quot;?  Sigh.



&gt; and at least one of their techs was so frustrated that he refuses to ever
&gt; work on it again.]

Has he /ever/ worked on an aircooled VW before?  Poor guy, being shoved
into this.


&gt; believed something to be wrong with her internally. Improperly ground cam
&gt; and incorrect cam timing are two of the ideas that were kicked around before

Both of which can certianly be measured by a competent mechanic.  Of
course, he'd have to know what in the word it oughta be set to to begin
with...




Now, I'm just stepping into this...but /do not/ take this thing back to
these guys.

I understand that you're starting a new job soon.  Monday?  Have you got a
Muir manual?  For all of the errors, it's a damn good start.

Sit down with the old bus and adjust the valves.  To .006&quot; lash.  Now,
staticly set the timing.   If you are not sure where to adjust it to,
default to 0 degrees (TDC), that will at least get you started.  You'll
need to research what distributor you have to find out how it should be
timed.  It's distributor dependant more then engine or year dependant.


The guy has probably futzed with the adjustments on the carb, as well.
Muir should have some good ballpark starting points on adjusting these,
though if you've got a 30/31 or one of the newer oddball carbs you may
need to ask the list. :)

Oh, and be sure to double check that firing order.

Anyway. Sit down, use this weekend to read through the book and go
step-by-step through the proceedures.  Ask the list for specifics when you
need'm.
