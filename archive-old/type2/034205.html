Subject: Fwd:  Winter gas mileage

Hi,

&gt; Has anyone else noticed a significant drop in gas mileage with colder
weather?

 Yeah.

&gt; I've noticed it in years past, but this winter it seems to be more
&gt; pronounced.  I am averaging 14mpg in mixed city/freeway driving
lately.  I
&gt; know that the increased use of the chokes accounts for some of it. 
Does
&gt; the increased density of colder air draw in more fuel as well?  I
think
&gt; not, but perhaps I'm mistaken.

 Dunno, but I doubt it. 14mpUSg is about 17.5 mpIg. That seems pretty
poor.
I'm getting just under 20 mpIg at the moment: ~15.5 mpUSg

&gt; For reference, my typical summer environment is 80-100 degrees F, and
&gt; typical winter environment is 30-50 degrees F.  I usually average
about
&gt; 16mpg in the same driving conditions in the summer.

 Hmm, I see 20-45F at the moment and 50-70F or so in summer.

&gt; Maybe it's something to do with the gas they sell in the winter?  I'm
&gt; getting tired of getting only 200 miles per $20 tank.

 I think the thing that's making most difference to me is that the roads
are busier because the weather's worse and congestion caused by
accidents
is more common for the same reason. I'm spending a lot more time in 
stop-go traffic than I was in the summer and a bus just drinks fuel
in that situation.

 OTOH, I'm getting more than 200 miles from a tank (~225, depending on
how brave I want to be with the fuel guage: typically 50 litres per
fillup, ~13-14 USg). I can't give numbers for the summer because I found
a leaky solenoid in my carb in the autumn which had been screwing up my 
mpg forever.
 This is on 95 RON unleaded fuel, sorry I can't remember the
conversiofor (R+M)/2. We don't have any of that oxygenated stuff,
AFAIK, and ISTR 
others saying they'd seen a drop in mpg since it was introduced.

 Hope this is useful.

Cheers,
	W.

PS Can't resist saying that your $20 tankful would cost me $60 :-(. You
   guys really should stop using so much oil!!! :-)
