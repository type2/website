&gt;Oh yeah, does anyone know how much this thing costs? 

The Tiger 581 CDI ignition--the &quot;Baja&quot; waterproofed one
is $94.95 including shipping.  The un-waterproof one is very
slightly cheaper.

&gt;Is it in the J.C. Whitney catalog?

No, they now carry another brand.  The one The Venerable
St. Hoover refered to, and which I described above, is
available from the manufacturer:

Universal Corporation
730 Independent Avenue
Grand Junction, CO 81505

I sent a money order, and received the CDI unit 20 days later.

&gt;Bob also notes that the spark plugs can be gapped much wider, 
&gt;does anyone know how much wider?

The instructions accompanying the CDI unit suggest .040 to .045
inch gap, although an equation they present (.375 X CR= gap in
inches) would yield .053 for my engine.  This seems kind of wide
to me though--I think they had higher compression water-pumpers
in mind.

Note:  
Be sure to mount the CDI unit so that the Way Kewl / Trick / Sano
&quot;Baja Scorpion&quot; logo is clearly visible--maybe put a little shelf at the
bottom of the rear window?

        it this time)
