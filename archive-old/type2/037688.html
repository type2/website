&gt;  Slide it smoothly forwards. As the door nears the

&gt; to reduce wear

&gt;  The door actually latches at the back, so that's
&gt; where you should
&gt; close it from.

Yes, this is a better method than simply slamming it
shut. But...the 'proper' way to close it (at least
according to my '69s owner's manual) is: &quot;To close,
press the door handle down (which releases the hook)
&lt;when the door is fully opened and locked in the open
position&gt; and push the door forward until it latches.
Then pull the handle up firmly until the sliding door
is flush with the rear panel.&quot;

This prevents excessive wear from slamming it shut all
the time. If your handle won't pull up, open the door
and lift the inside locking lever so that it's level
and try again...it should work.

I'm on my third bus in 18 years and only learned the
proper way last year.... I *still* can't convince my
11 year old not to slam it, though...maybe when it all
breaks, I'll take the new parts out of his allowance;-)
