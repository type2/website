Merry Christmas!

I am currently trying to finish my 1600 upright in my 1979 bus.  I received
the proper cooling tin and rear engine carrier from Bus Depot.  I never have
seen how this all hooks together before (the engine carrier that is) and
would like some help from anyone who could look under their pre-'72 for me
or who knows anything about this.  What does the engine carrier attach to
(besides the chassis)?  Does it attach under the rear of the transmission or
the rear of the motor?  I'm ready to do some rigging but was wondering if
anyone knew a good way.  Do I drill and tap the case for it (yeash)?  Does
it have a rigid connection or does it use a rubber mount?  The one thing I
know is the engine carrier attaches to the chassis with rubber mounts.  Help
me so I can have an official upright in my bus!  Thanks.

Christopher
