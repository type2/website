&gt; I used my torch to warm up the area all around the grease zerk in the
&gt; center of the front end.  The lever shaft area.  While I pressed the
&gt; grease guns tip as hard as I could to the zerk and my husband pumped the
&gt; grease in the only place it finally began to emerge was through the little
&gt; hole in the relay lever shafts bottom cap.  ARG!

When it's full the grease has to come out of somewhere doesn't it?

Why did you heat it up. To get the old grease out more easily?

&gt; Question: Should I pull that little cap off and dig around to see what
&gt; crud I might loosen up?

No.

&gt; Will I need a new cap to replace the old one once
&gt; its pulled off? 

The bottom cap is hammered onto the shaft. If you deform it during removal
you may not be able to get it back on.

&gt; Question: What in the world size thing-a-majig fits the drain and fill
&gt; doodads on the transmission?  It looks like an allen wrench the size of
&gt; Toledo.

It's a 17mm head in allen key form or 3/8&quot; socket. You'll find one for $4 at
the local vw parts store.

&gt; Question:  Is there anyway to make the wingwindows not flop around?  I
&gt; looked for the screws I saw in the Bently Manuel but I cannot find them on
&gt; my bus.

I rebuilt my windows recently:

- I oiled the little gearbox.
- I straightened the rods
- I pinched the rivets
