Hey list,
I'm in process of converting to an alternator on my '71.  Any advice on
wiring it up would be appreciated.  I've heard ideas of replacing the stock
regulator with a terminal block or else somehow wiring the regulator to
perform a similar function.  Oh yeah, the alternator is internally
regulated.  Thanks in advance.
Paul
