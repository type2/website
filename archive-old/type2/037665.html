Subject: RE: Westy dome light switches 

&gt;Both switches on my dome light(over the table) are malffunctioning
&gt;/missing pieces. Anyone know where to find these parts? I need the 
&gt;2-position push button switch with the lock nut and the 2position 
&gt;twist switch with the knob (or whatever was on there).

On your 70 Westy, the original over-the-rear-table dome light should have 2 
holes in the cover on the underside for switches.  Both are simple push-button 
switches with lock nuts (the nuts vibrate loose so are often missing).  One 
switch is wired to turn on the middle bulb while the other switch is wired to 
turn on the other 2 bulbs.  To my knowledge, there were no knobs on these 
switches - just the metal pushbutton rods.

If the switches are in deed defective, you should be able to find some suitable 
replacements at any good electronics-geek store.
