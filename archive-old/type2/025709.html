I would like to ask the collective wisdom of the list about the difference
between the Weber Progressive and the IDF 40s.

Mine is a 1973 Bus with an entirely stock Type 4 engine. It currently has
Solexs on it. It has been recommended my most everyone I talk to that
switching to Webers will improve the overall performance of the bus.

I believe there are three options -- from Weber -- for me to consider; IDF
36s, IDF 40s or a Progressive. I would like to know the pro and cons of
each.

The bus is a daily driver. My daily commute involves climbing over the Santa
Cruz mountains (Hwy 17 for those who know) to get into Silly Cone Valley
each day. I'm not looking to turn it into a high performance machine. But I
wouldn't mind improving the performance when I can.

I don't work on the engine myself. All the engine work is professionally
done. The shop I take the bus to likes the Progressives and the IDF 40s.
