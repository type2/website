Subject: Re: Dog house/external cooler 

-- Your message was:   (from &quot;JAIME CHRISWISSER&quot;) (in part)
  .....
  I installed a doghouse on my '69 Westy with a stock 1600. I have
  cylinder head temp (attached to #3), oil temp and oil pressure gauges
  and this is what they showed me....
  Oil temp....NO CHANGE, NONE.
  Oil pressure...dropped about 10-15 pounds at idle; no change while
  driving.
  Cylinder temp....BIG CHANGE, about 15-20 degrees LOWER!!
  The doghouse wasn't designed to cool the oil better, but to keep the
  #3 cylinder from overheating....
  Also, I'm not sure what piece of tin you refer to, but my doghouse is
  totally enclosed except for where the air comes from the fan inside
  the cooling tin.....
  ------------------

You response does make sense, especially the point that the &quot;new&quot; setup
keeps the heads cooler but not perhaps the oil itself.  I looked at the
cooling tin this weekend while my engine sat on the ground and it still
was a little puzzling as to how enough cool air could get to the cooler.
The intake for the duct that delivers air to the cooler is only about a
1/4 inch in width, about 12 inches long, and sits on the front-right
inside of the fan housing.  Since it works, it must be that the most
important function of the fan is to cool the heads and blowing air through
the tiny tubing in the cooler is a secondary chore.  Thus, VW's are *air
cooled* and not *oil cooled*.

The piece of tin I'm talking about is one you very rarely see, even on
show turn-key engines sitting in custom VW shops.  It is a small L-shaped
bracket at attaches to the oil cooler studs that hold to cooler to the
doghouse flange.  If you read Benchleys or some other shop manual, you'll
see that fan housing removal first begins with removing the 10 mm bolt
that attaches the housing in front to this bracket that is attached to the
cooler.  The function of the bracket is to close off the bottom of the
doghouse and force all the air through the interior of the cooler.
Obviously, Busses won't blow up without it since most people have never
heard or seen this little puppy.  I find it strange though that those
chrome aftermarket doghouse tin accessories packages (the ones with the
triangular shaped tin, the exhaust scoop, and the rubber) don't include
the item since it isn't a lot of metal and would cost nothing to produce.
Even Gene Berg no longer sells this piece (for what that worth...) but it
is part of the stock set-up.

Thanks for the info.

Nick
