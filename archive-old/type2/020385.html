Re:  my post of 12/29, many thanks to Shaggy, Robb, Parker, David S.,
John J., Britt, Tony in NJ, Pat, Robert, Shawn and Joey for their
thoughtful suggestions and advice.  I spent most of yesterday and today
underneath the bus checking ball joints, relay arm and tie rods for
wasted motion, toe-in, steering box connections, caliper clearance,
wheel lugs, front beam lubrication and so forth.  I found nothing amiss.
Went to my log book (if I don't write it down......) and realized that I
had not tried lower tire pressures after installing the rear sway bar. 
Moral:  even writing it down so you won't forget doesn't help if you
don't read it.  Gosh, being over 50 is fun.  Dropped the fronts to 30,
rears to 40, drove it, felt like it was on rails, felt foolish and
relieved simultaneously.  Happy New Year to all, and to all,
				Best regards - Dave
