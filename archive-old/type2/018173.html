&gt; collateral costs and parts should I be considering when the neighbors
&gt; insurance company try's to low ball me.
&gt; 
&gt; I think they just bought my bus.
&gt; -

My sister really was cheaped out by the insurance company of the guy
that pulled out and stopped in front of her '73 superbeetle.  She hit
him at about 35-40 mph and totally munched the front end of her car. 
The totaled her out, low of course and this was after she had gone
throught a bad time of getting all the running gear refurbished, engine
rebuilt, etc.  Didn't look like much, but ran good!

my advice: approach your neighbors and ask them to buy the van without
reporting the accident to insurance.  If you can.  I'll bet big bucks
that you won't get anything close to what the westy is worth. . .
