Subject: Carb Balls

I was trying to explain where the two small balls are in a carburetor to
another list member, I didn't have much luck with my describing them and
where to find them. I have also always used a front head light screw
from a bug to get them out, any one else ever found a better screw?

So if any of you carb rebuilders that can explain detail in words please
help me get this advice in an understandable form. Thank You!

Meredith
