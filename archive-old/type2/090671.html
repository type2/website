Subject: Re: [T2] Road Trippin 

Giles,

I have gone west to Seattle via Chitown and it is about a 4 day trip at
12-13 driving hours per day, with pee breaks and meal breaks (once you get
past 40 the former is more important than the latter :-)  Add a day to SF
on 5 and yeah, 5 days is do-able.

Your biggest problem, as I see it is that there is no route over the
mountains south of the Columbia River and Portland.  Once up there, you
can come up the Columbia river valley on 84.  It is steep in spots, at
least headed west.  At Kennewick, you have a choice of heading north on
82 to hit 90 and come thru Couer D'Alene and Montana on 90 or stay on 84
southeast to 80 and Boise.  I like the Couer D'Alene pass.  It is steep,
but it is the only serious pass there is on that road.

If you stay on 84 it will head over on the Snake River plain, which is
flat, then drop (gradually. but severely) into Salt Lake city, then you
exit on 80.  Climbing out of Salt Lake City is not something I have done,
but it is a heck of a ride coming in!!!  30-40 miles of steep slope!
Then it is flat across Wyoming untill Cheyanne...  *BIG* hill after
Cheyenne, then you are on a 600 mile downhill slope to the Mississippi.
Pancake city from there to Chitown!

Up to you, but I like the 5-84-82-90 thru the pass at Couer D'Alene
better.

                           Steve Dolan
