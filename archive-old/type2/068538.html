Hitched a ride home from work last night, on the way my colleague had to 
pick up her kids at the baby sitters.  (BTW she drives a VW Golf) On the 
last leg home I told the kids they'd be able to see all the VW campers in 
my driveway!  &lt; I have a parter 73, Folly the 72 and Moo the 88 westies&gt; 
When he saw Folly, Jack asked &quot;Gee, how old is that one?&quot; &quot;I think it was 
born in 72&quot; says I... &quot;Gee says he, you should call this place The Old 
Volks home&quot;!
