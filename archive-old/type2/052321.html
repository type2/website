Subject: [T2] Cam Gear Torque Specs

Hi All,
Its been awhile since I've posted due to moving etc.
To get you up to speed, I'm rebuilding my 1600 SP in my '70 Westy.
I have had TONS of questions but most of them has been answered by the
archives.

So, to cut to the chase I am putting in a new camshaft and the gear came
separately (Both Bugpack).  I can find no torque specs for the gear to the
shaft.
Should I use Loctite?
Any info would help.

As a side note - since this is my first rebuild I think I am experiencing
some sort of pre-engine assembly anxiety.
Anyone else remember this happening? :)

Ciao
