Subject: Starts and stalls right away

Hi volks,

I was hoping someone has some insight as to what's going on with my 75 westy. It has been idle for about a week due to a broken clutch cable and I finally had enough daylight free time to replace it today. When I went to start it after the minor work, it started right away and immediatly stalled. This could be repeated for about 5 times and then, it would just turn over and not start at all. After waiting for about 5 minutes, it would do it again (start and stall right away for about 5 times until it would no longer start at all). I have checked everything obvious that may have been accidentally knocked off while I was replacing the cable with no sucess. Does anyone have an idea of what's up with my girl? Any point in any direction will be appreciated.
