&gt; &gt;In conclusion, GET GAUGES!  With oil temp and cylinder head temp gauges
&gt; &gt;you can drive around without the flaps and not worry too much because
&gt; &gt;you will be able to monitor the temperature of the oil and cylinders and
&gt; &gt;shut the engine down before it becomes a problem.

&gt; Hmmm, I think I would prefer having the flaps to having the gauges~
&gt;

          Not me!  Gauges are pretty much mandatory on my vehicles. And, while
the flaps are still in my T4 engine, there is no thermostat, and I always tore
the flaps out of T1's. I never drive off before my Cyl.Head Temp gauge reads
100 anyway, and the slight extra warmup time is irrelevant. Of course, since I
don't have an engine seal either, my engine probably warms up faster than most
sitting at idle.   8-)
         If you love your bus -- get at least a oil tem and oil pressure gauge.
