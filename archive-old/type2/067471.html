Subject: Why I got My first bus!

Our dry cleaner delivery man, when I was in high school, drove a split 
window VAN - no windows. I used to totally get off on it. I was a 
surfer chick in southern cal and had a 62 Ford Falcon with surf racks 
and hippie curtians in the back windows... it was NOT the coolest ride 
in town! I lusted over that van... my dad (a fighter pilot in WWII and 
Korea) said that VWs were living proof that the Germans really did win 
the was afterall... he called them &quot;Hitler's Revenge!&quot; 

Then - much to his and my surprise, his Air Force co-pilot's daughter 
pulled up to our house one day in a brand new 1968 camper!!!  My dad 
stood there like a mindless gape while she told him that her DAD had 
bought it for her for graduation!!! It was the BEST! We took a KILLER 
road trip from Seal Beach, CA to Santa Cruz... surfing, of course and I 
fell in love with it!!! I really wanted a bus!!!

Then one day at Seal Beach pier - big waves but lots of wind - I just 
sat in my Falcon trying to figure out if it was worth getting blown 
away to catch a few combers... and up pulls a KILLER '65 Bus with a 
darling blonde guy driving it. We became sweeties and in the time 
between our meeting and GETTING MARRIED - I bought a brand new 1970 
Cloud White Kombi... that became one of the most beautiful buses in 
southern cal... inside shutters between the front and the back - 
beautiful (for the day) turquoise and blue SHAG carpet and rattan 
furniture inside.... oh... and surf racks on top. Well - to make a long 
story short... I divorce the guy 3 years later and ended up with the 
splittie.... WITH A SUPER 1600 PORSCHE IN IT!!! I had all the body work 
done and painted metalic root beer brown - put on Jackman Off Road 
wheels and she was a BEAUTE! I had her until my last year in college 
when my dad bought me a new Ford Gran Torino and had it delivered to me 
as a surprise... he STILL HATED VW's. So I sold the splittie for 
NOTHING and assumed the role of the sophisticated WASP! It didn't last 
long.... between then and 1986 I had a '67 VW sunroof bug and a 1953 
Chevy Sedan Delivery.... then....

In 1986 a friend found what was to become Her Majesty ... a 1968 bus 
that had been in storage since 1971... in the desert... with NO rust... 
and the rest is history!!! I will NEVER sell Her Purpleness.... I will 
ALWAYS have VW's.... and I'm sure my dad is turning over in his grave 
as we speak!

:-)

Keep on Keepin' On!!!

Kath - the 46 year old teenager and Her Majesty - the bus that makes 
people smile!!!
