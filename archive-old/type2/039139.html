Subject: Re:  aeroshell oil

Hi Ron

&gt; BTW, , ,  I recomember using AeroShell oil in my veedubs. It was designed
&gt;  for air cooled engines.
&gt;  
&gt;  Any comments about that?

Yeah... it's made for a totally different application than the environment in 
and around a VW motor...

You have a tremendous RPM range in a car; an airplane holds at the same RPM 
for sometimes hours.  The seals are of different materials, as are the 
bearings (Airplane cams are generally rollers, VW are solid lobe and solid 
lifter), the oil is made to hold different metals in situ, the detergents in 
Airplane oil are different than Auto oil... the ambient temps are a *lot* 
different in the 2 different environments, etc...

I could go on, but to make it simple... I put 60,000 miles worth of wear on a 
motorcycle (honda 750) motor in less than 10, 000 using Aeroshell.  I wrote 
the company; the told me *definately* not for auto applications... and as I 
was using a non-approved product in the bike, they really didn''t want to 
help me (and didn't), but did tell me what wear I caused before I told them 
(Flattening cam lobes, galled bearing surfaces, destroyed seals)... Mind you, 
they make more on Aeroshell, and were it economic, they would rather sell the 
more profitable item... they told me to go with the Rotella oils instead.  
Serious about this.  **DON'T** run Aeroshell in your car.

If you don't believe me, call Shell.  They wil give you the skinny on it, 
really.  Their product info line is really good.
