 Hi Adam,
 
 I don't think anyone is advocating that he mix
 cams and lifters. Just
 passing along the facts in answer to his question!
 So he may make a decision
 based on fact.
 And the fact is that they will work mixed, just
 not without damage, as stated!
 
 
&gt; You can't mix/match lifters and cams.  Some folks
will say  they have done it.  Those are the same   
folks that are always
pulling their motors to fix
them each month.
Stick with solids.  Then you know what you got.

Correct, I have 2 77 Westies, both are running solid
cams with used hydraulic lifters on them, one has over
200,000 TROUBLEFREE miles on it and the other has over
150,000 TROUBLEFREE miles on it.  

No I do NOT pull my engines to fix them each month. My
daughter drives hers everyday and I did mine, until a
drunk plowed into it.
