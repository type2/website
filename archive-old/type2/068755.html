Subject: Valves and the Rebutal to correction

 I have been informed by the esteemed Vdubber aka Hoover that
I was correct the first time and that it is a 2 stroke 4 cycle.

 I am unclear on the definition as anyone.

When the smoke clears maybe someone will explain what the hell I
do mean.

 What then is a four stroke?
