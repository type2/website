I am doing my first tune up since buying &quot;The Grommie&quot; . P.O. had done a 
tune-up right before I bought it . Grommie is a 1970 , rebuilt motor at  
85,000 currently 104,000 I assume the owner kept everything as stock, so most 
probably a 1600SP. I set the points at 50 Degrees and the timing is supposed 
to be 0T.D.C.
This is my dilemma, it seems to sound/run better , when the timing mark on 
the pulley is  about 1/4'' (ok,Iam a carpenter) to the right  of the crack on 
the case. Could this be OK or should I be sticking with what's spec? Also 
should the motor be warm when you set points and timing ?
