&gt; Didn't get a reply to my query how to hook up the pressure sender

Hey there Mike,

I usually reply off-list to posts (to save bandwidth), and *assumed*
that someone else must have answered your question offlist. Oops.

On the sender: G goes to the guage. WK goes to the warning lamp (lamp
in german is a word that begins with a K). You've got the dual
sender, right?? The sender should be grounded to the case, or if your
using the vdo extention hose thru the mounting strap for the sender.

On the guage:  S is for signal (from the sender). Hook the wire that
comes from the G terminal on the sender here. The + is for hot
switched power (when the iginition key is on), and the blank is the
negitive (s/b marked - , or at least mine was).

Hope this helps,
