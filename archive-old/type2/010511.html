Seems to me that the most important part of locating the fire
extinguisher is to put it where the fire _isn't_!

Behind the driver's seat seems a good place.  The mount should be one
that allows the extinguisher to be withdrawn without flipping any
levers, clips, etc.  Speed is of the essence!  The ideal would be a
tube that is just big enough to accept the extinguisher.  Cap one end,
and install the tube to the front of the bulkhead (thinking early Bay
here) behind the seat, slanting so that the extinguisher can be grabbed
without moving the seat.  The door would hold the extinguisher in place
when it is closedclosed.

Another advantage to this arrangement is that it would be easy to
remove and shake the extinguisher once a month or so, which keeps the
powder loose and usable.  If you let the extinguisher sit too long, the
powder clumps together and the extinguisher won't work!
