Subject: [T2] repairing sliding door on a 70

&gt; Having trouble with the sliding door on a '70 Westy.While sitting in a
garage
&gt; the door became stuck. I find I can open the door if I pull on the handle
as
&gt; hard as I can, which I am hesitant to do on a regular basis.When closing
the
&gt; door pulling up on the handle pulls in the rear of the door like it should
,
&gt; just won't open easily. Any suggestions?

You will need to pull the inner door panel (if you actually have one) You
will see two rods that go from the handle to the latch.  Turn the handle and
see how it works.  Now, do you see the little sleeves on the rod toward the
handle side.  These screw either way to adjust the rods and take up tension.
Adjust it a little at a time and see how that works.  Don't forget to check
the handle on both sides.  As you can adjust it so one side works great and
the other doesn't AMHIK.  While your in there go ahead and lube the moving
parts and make them easier to move.  I usually use white lithium grease but
use what you have.
