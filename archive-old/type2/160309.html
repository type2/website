Subject: Re: [T2] engine seal how to

Hi Adam,

I always start from the back and work forward. Not a huge difference  
but I figure if the seal comes up short the gap will be at the front  
of the engine compartment rather than positioned directly between the  
muffler and the air intake. That's about the worst place possible for  
a seal to be missing or misaligned.

The seal I am using now is the same one I've used for about 5 years,  
and it sometimes comes up about half an inch short. Not a huge deal  
if the gap is above the transmission.

Happy trails,

&gt; That way the two ends are at the front and it helps you know that  
&gt; it's on
&gt; correctly.
