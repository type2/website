Subject: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

Thanks for everyone earlier in the week who encouraged me to change my points, condensor, etc by myself. 
I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine. Even with an offset box wrench, even if I CAN get the wrench on the nut to the right of the disty, I have no way to turn it. Does anyone have any tricks on how I can get this thing out of my motor?

What I ended up doing was changing the points while the disty was still installed. It went OK, no screws dropped, and everything checks out OK: dwell, timing, etc., except I couldn't get the condensor off. Is this a big deal?

Now to the plugs: I bought an extended 21mm socket and went to town. On the two rear cylinders, once the plugs screwed loose, they dropped on to the block (?) and needed to be fished out from underneath the sheet metal shroud that I can barley get two fingers into. I was able to do that using a piece of looped wire and hooking the bent electrode and slowly pulling them out (Don't ask why I didn't have my handy magnet tool). Now my qyestion is how the hell I'm supposed to get them back in?! Is there such a thing as a magnetized socket for these things? Did I buy the wrong tool?

Thanks for any guidance you can give,
