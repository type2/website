Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh Air vent seals

Anyhow, as was recommended in the archives, I used 1/8&quot; foam tape to
&gt; fashion new seals. All went well. It seals better but not completely.
&gt; Has anyone used more than 1/8&quot; seals?  I'm really thinking about putting
&gt; another layer of foam tape on top of the existing tape.  Any
&gt; recommendations?&gt;

Is your linkage adjusted correctly? I discovered that my passenger side 
flapper was not closing correctly b/c the little white nylon coupler 
would not pull the flappers tight. If I was going to redesign that 
system I'd have a crossshaft with arms reaching out to BOTH flappers 
and then have the crossshaft linked to the dash lever. That way both 
got a firm pull but then I guess that would have costed VW $1.50 
more... &lt;griN!&gt; I layered my neoprene on the inside of the flappers 
just as stock. No road test yet...
