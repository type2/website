Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition switch trouble

Dave,

This is common, I am assuming that you have a '68-'73 bus. In this case the
electrical half of your ignition switch is probably broken. There is a
tightly wound spring in the plastic switch mechanism that returns the key to
the on position after starting that usually cracks the plastic. Causing an
inconsistent pain in your #_at_*%.

Please be careful when starting you bus with a wrench on the starter. This
is one very close to possible leaky fuel lines and two if the vehicle is in
gear it can start and lurch over you. This has killed a bus owner before.
Please be careful.

These switches are easy to replace and not that expensive. We have new and
used ones for all years. Please  feel free to call me and order one and I
would be happy to describe in detail the installation process. I believe
this item is on the website as well.

&gt; Recently (well, several months ago) I started having problems

&gt; So, anyone had this problem before?  I could use some advice.
