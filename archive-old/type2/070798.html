Subject: '66 Westy for sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a good restorable '66 hard top Westy for sale.

I would like to get $800 for it.  Check this link for lots of pics and info.

The bus is located south of St. Louis Missouri.  I will accept any offer 
close to my asking price, but I will sell it to whoever offers the most and 
can convince me they will complete the sale and pick the bus up within 2 
weeks.
