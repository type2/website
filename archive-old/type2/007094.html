&lt;&lt; Has anyone devised a nice, tidy way to hang up their front seatbelts? 
 Maybe button parts (the parts attached to the base of the seat pedastals) 
 bolted into the B pillars? Or something velcro?
 
 Tell us about it!

How about the original hooks that came on your bus when it was new.  These
were located on the pillars behind the coat hook (button).  Most of these have
long since been broken off.

I bought new ones from Jim at Old Volks Home.  Of course I no longer need them
since I've installed the retractables.
