Yes. Up behind there you will see a 6mm bolt welded to the chassis. Any 
hardware store will have steel straps about an inch wide with a series of 
holes in it. Many radios have something similar provided, as do radio 
install kits. You will need not more than a foot of this. Bend this strap 
so you can bolt one end to that chassis bolt and the other to the bolt on 
the back of the radio. All that is required is this simple support to 
prevent the radio from bouncing.
