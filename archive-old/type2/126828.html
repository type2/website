Subject: Re: [T2] Generator to Alternator Swap

&gt; Hey, guys.  I'm facing this swap.  Just looked in
&gt; the library (nice article Jim!) and searched post
&gt; posts.  Just wondering if anyone can tell me
&gt; which alternator kits currently available have
&gt; the best fitting parts, have the best directions,
&gt; and are the most complete.

I'm assuming that you are talking about a type 1 engine.

The typical &quot;alternator kit&quot; consists of a new brazilian Bosch alternator,
an chinese alternator stand, some thin taiwanese tin, and some very
sketchy instructions.

Save yourself some aggrevation,  Buy the AL82N alternator from your
VWFLAPS.  Buy the alternator stand from a VW salvage yard.  If you
currently have a bug (30A) generator, the tin and fan hub will work for
the alternator.  If you have a bus (38A) generator, you will also need the
three pieces of bug alternatortin and the bug fan hub from the VW salvage
yard.

Used VW tin is superior to new Taiwan tin.

Since the new regulator is internal, you will have to bypass the existing
regulator.  Make two male spade to male spade adapters from copper strip.
At the regulator, disconnect the two heavy wires and connect them together
with one adapter and insulate well.  Disconnect the two light wires and
connect them together and insulate well.  Leave the ground wire alone.

That's it!
