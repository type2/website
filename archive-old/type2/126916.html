Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal problems.

i myself am haveing this same problem... when i push the brakes my turn signal light is on on the dash but has stopped flashing.....
i will start with my contacts first ...and go from there...?
seems like it stopped for a bit when i cleaned my front contacts,..... after takeing the bulb out.... 
rounded sandpaper around.. but its started back... has to be comeing from the back now...?
i resealed the front ones so surely they dont need sanding again...?
peace
good luck yourself
Chris

Id check to see what the wires at the tail look like.
I had the brake stops the turn signal problem and it
was caused by corrosion on the contacts. I wouldnt be
surprised if some genius spliced the left and right
turn signals together (Ive seen stranger) also try
replacing the turn signal relay. (after taking apart
the rear lights an cleaning all the contacts.)

I hate electrical work (it took me a half day of work
and two days of thinking to install my CDI, which
would take a normal person half an hour.). So what I
do is take one rear lamp apart at a time so I can
reassemble it using the other lamp as a guide.
