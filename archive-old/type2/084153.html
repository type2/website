&gt; I really would like this info if you have it. I have some pictures but
&gt; nothing &quot;close up&quot;.

Here's a project bus that was rusting across town.  I have
not seen it for months.   I've seen one other like it, which
was completely finished.   I regret not taking more photos
and especially a photo of the right side.  I forget how the
sliding door was 'modified'.
