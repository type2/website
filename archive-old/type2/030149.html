Yup.  Thats the DIN sleeve.

&gt; This sleeve is narrow (left to right - does not catch these edges), and it 
&gt; is fat (top to bottom).  it just isn't workable.  The AWIA was just $99, 


But if you ignore the sleeve, and slide the radio into the hole..(i might
have the side-to-side vs top-to-bottom changes wrong..i think i do
actually)...how much do you have to clear?

Almost all of the DIN units will &quot;catch&quot; on the metal lip of the dash
opening, if you slide them in. And use the backstrap, of course. (i've had
a blau, a pioneer, a kenwood, and two alpines installed in exactly this
manner.)

But you are probably right, that its more top to bottom then side to
side...if you dont use the sleeve, its that much more you dont need to
sorry about, and makes it a very minor change to the dash to fit.

good luck either way.
