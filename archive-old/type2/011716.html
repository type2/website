Just drove 2 hours w/ 25-35 mph wind gust's on
interstate 35 in Iowa (no trees)could barely keep it
in one lane! I was wondering how much play the
steering should have? 79' Westy, w/ front oversize
sway bar (1 7/8) i think w/ urethane bushings
Installed to compensate for the po installed rear sway
bar . I have kyb gas adjust shocks on all fours and
goodyear wrangler radial h/t 185/14 tires. is this set
up any good why is there a need to put a non- factory
swaybar on the back, I would think if it was necessary
vw engineers would have put one there. Also only the
right front ball joint was replaced by the po, would
this have any effect on poor steering response.
Thanks all, I dont know what id do without this list,
and its advice. Stranded in Iowa.
