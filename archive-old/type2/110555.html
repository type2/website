Subject: door handles

Anyone know the process for painting door handles?  I am getting rid of all the chrome on my 79' Westy and doing all my trim in black.  Do I have to have the chrome stripped and have them powdercoated?

I'm also looking for info on mounting speakers.  Where are yours?  I don't want to mess with my cabinets since they are original and in perfect shape, so if anyone has a lead on some cabinets for sale that match the '79 faux wood, I'd be interested so that I could replace one or two panels with custom cut speaker holes without damaging what is already there.  I'm looking for the piece under the back seat and the cabinet face above the back seat.

Thanks!

Rob
79' Westy
