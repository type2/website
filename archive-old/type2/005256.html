Subject: Fried coil - I think?

Here is the problem - when I was installing radio in my bus I forgot to
disconnect the negative wire from the coil - now the wire in the distributor
is
melting down when ignition is on - is the coil toast ?.

Is it OK to run the wire to the radio directly from the battery ( fuse in
line of course)?

Thanks for suggestions -
