The 1700cc engine should have a distributor with a rev limiter, approx. 5400rpm.
Just keep your foot flat on the floor 'til it stops accelerating, then change
up. You may note the speed when each shift occurs.

I have a 2000cc engine (with rev limiter) and a 1600cc gearbox, maximum speeds
in each gear are (approx from memory):

1st: 20mph
2nd: 35mph
3rd: 55mph
4th: ???
reverse: only kidding!

What would be the recommended shift points(rpms) for a 72 type 2 with a
1700cc engine?
