if you want to drill a perfectly round hole, i would
try going to a hardware store and picking up a drill
bit that drills a big hole approximately the size of
the gauge you want to install.   the bits are usually
used for boring holes in wood.   this might solve your
problem.

&gt; I am planning to fit an Oil Temperature guage in my
&gt; '70 camper - and so I
&gt; want to cut a circular hole in the dashboard.  (I
&gt; wouldn't do this if it was
&gt; a good dashboard, but it already has a bigger hole
&gt; hacked in it for a stereo
&gt; - not very good at all.)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone, know the best way to do this ?  (I want a
&gt; nice neat *Round* hole)
&gt; I'll also want to fit a lighter-socket in a similar
&gt; manner.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, has anyone got any better ideas of
&gt; where/how to fit these
&gt; items ?
