Subject: Gas Tank Suck

OK, I currently have my engine and gas tank out of my 71 to fix my second gas
tank leak in 8 months! (Replaced old tank with current tank in March of this
year)
Where the tank is leaking this time, it almost looks like the tank wall has
buckled from suction inside the tank (picture a beer can that has been pushed
in a bit on the side).  This led me to re-consider a few things that have been
happening in my Westy. First of all, while camping a few months ago I hear a
sound coming from the tank area, like a gurgling sound, continued all night.
Engine is off and I'm trying to sleep. I hear this sound on other occasions
after parking the bus. Secondly, I have been noticing air pockets in my fuel
line and specifically, the clear fuel filter actually runs dry sometimes while
driving. Thirdly, everytime I fill up with gas, the gas cap really hisses alot
when I take it off due to suction inside the tank.
So what the hell?  Should my fuel tank really be so air tight that the fuel
being pumped out of it is creating a suction inside the tank enough to suck in
the walls and account for my multiple leaks? Is the tube coming out of the top
of the tank and going up into the side vent area suposed to be a breather line
to relieve such suction?  Or have I just had bad luck developing these 2 leaks
in eight months with no real cause??
Here I sit with my engine on the floor anxiously awaiting advice from the wise
ones...

Peace, John Baker
