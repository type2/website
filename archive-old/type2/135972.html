Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Pimp My Ride on M-TV

Honestly, I dislike ANY show that modifys a car from stock.

The show I hate the most is called DriveShaft. They basically take two interesting cars, and butcher them. It wouldn't bother me if they were all Chevy Celebrities, but they've taken like.. a mint condition 1970 Lincoln Continental, or an Oldsmobile 442...

And the first thing they do is beat the cars with baseball bats... bash in the windows, dent the hoods, and destroy the roofs..

WHY??? There are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of cars in the junkyard right now that could be used for such a thing, why do they feel the need to take unique old cars off the road and destroy them?

I really hope that they do this VW Bus justice on Pimp my Ride.. but the way I see it is, at least that's ONE LESS BUS that's going to end up in the junkyard. If it can be saved from the crusher for another 4 years, then so be it.

I suspect they'll probably do a hippie theme with this Bus, since that's really what most people associate vintage Volkswagens with.

&gt; I'd let &quot;Rides&quot; or &quot;Overhaulin'&quot; touch my cars because for them it is mostly paint and minor improvements... 
&gt; Not Pimpin' though... They build cars for the circus on that show...
