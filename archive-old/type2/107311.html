Subject: Vintage VW insurance/again

  Just got off the phone with Pollman's Insurance and got quotes for a
couple of my VW's. To insure my wifes 65 fake rag top and my 1960 DD panel
is $170.00 dollars a year for 10,000 dollars coverage and a 250 dollar
deductable.
  You are also allowed to drive to work SOMETIMES and also no mileage
limitations, seems to be the best policy out there for us MULTPLE VW owners.
I currently have 5 insured with my Farmers and changeing them all over will
save me 1000&quot;s a year. 
  The downside is they require that all VW's are kept in locked garages, my
current garage will hold 2 and they are pouring concrete today for my garage
addition that will hold 2 to 3 more.
  It will 14 foot tall ceilings so I can put one on the lift (future plans)
and park another under it. Too many buses and not enough garage.
   Here's a link to their site, they have offices in Cali and now have one
in Phoenix, AZ.
