howdy,

First: can I just cut the windshield rubber to make it easier to
take off?

most importantly:
my 77 camper made a very loud (you could kinda feel it) thump
thump thump! all the way home from work last time I drove it.
It stopped right before I reached home.
It increased with speed and changed tone slightly when I  went
around corners.
It became louder when accelerating most of the time and slightly
quieter when gliding.
the bus shifts fine.
It seemed to be coming from the rear.
CV?
That is my guess, but I am not positive.

peace,
Thom
