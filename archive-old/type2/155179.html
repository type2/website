Subject: [T2] Turbo Bus update

I have seen a few conversions with a radiator in the rear, a couple with subaru motors and the 
radiator effectively on the back bumper where the engine hatch is and seem to have worked OK, 
but it's far from popular. I have seen a Leyland V8 conversion with the radiator where the spare 
wheel well is and it constantly over heated.
The most popular conversions have the radiator up the front or underneath (either at the front or 
in the middle). If the ducting is done well and the fans working effectively they seem quite 
effective underneath.

That said, I chickened out and added a front mount
radiator cuz I simply did not have enough time for R&amp;D
for the rear mount. The Aussies are using radiators
mounted underneath successfully.
