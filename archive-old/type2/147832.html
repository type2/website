What is this &quot;wax&quot; you speak of? :-)

I've been using one of those wash-and-wax carwash soaps lately .. 
because I've got it and the price was right (free).  I used a paste 
wax on my Fastback a couple of years ago and was quite happy 
with the results (I'd only used liquid before that) .. but ran out of 
ambition at the same time I ran out of wax.  It was only a 
partial can to begin with, got about 3/4 of the car done.  

I shudder to think how much wax and work it would take to do 
my Westy.  Thank the gods it's got a shiny fresh paintjob.
