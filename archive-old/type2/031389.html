You do NOT have to pull the heads on a T1 engine to remove the pushrod
tubes.  To put new STOCK ones on you do.  But you can remove the valve
cover, rocker shaft, and pushrods then take the pliers and proceed to
destroy your existing tubes to get them out.  You'll be forced to replace
them with spring loaded or double-nut tubes if you aren't going to pull
the head which are inferior to the stock tubes but will work in a pinch.
