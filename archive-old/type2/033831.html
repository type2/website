Subject: Re: Radios

my experience in my 69 westy is that the existing hole is just little
narrow for most radios.  i took a grinder and took out about a 1/8 inch on
top and bottom to make things work much easier.  plus, the original blank
out plate or original trim plate will cover this up should you decide to go
back to stock.

ive had two radios so far that fit good: a pioneer KE1818 and a kenwood
1007, both shaft style radios.  the pioneer does not enough power to make
the sounds audible, so try to find a radio that puts out at least 20 Watts
(RMS, not peak) per channel.  the kenwood is ok, but i added an amp to make
it much easier to hear the radio.  

plus, if you take out the ashtray, you'll see a screw back there that holds
it to the dash or something.  it makes a conveinent place to attach the
mounting strap off the back of the radio to keep it from bouncing up and down.
