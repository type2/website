This sounds like an effective way to find leaks, but I am suspicious. The 
difference between lower pressure inside the system and higher pressure 
inside the system has an effect on the integrity of the connections. 
L-Jetronic systems were designed to be self-sealing, but if you 
pressurized the inside of one, even when new, it would leak.
