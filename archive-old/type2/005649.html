Hi Erich,

Consider that if the clutch isn't disengaging, it may be the hydraulics, or
an internal malfunction.  Have you actually looked under the vehicle and
watched the actuator as a cohort pumps the pedal?  If the clutch arm is
moving the problem could be internal.  If it isn't moving and you do the
bleeding routine:  if he pushes on the pedal and nuthin comes out, the
master could be bad.  If fluid comes out strongly, the slave cylinder is
bad.

A standard brake bleeder kit can be used ( it is helpful if you wire the
bottle up along side the tranny so you can see it) so that you catch and see
the residue fluid.  Or a length of neoperine hose and a pickle jar and some
tape and wire will do.  The hose fits over the zerk fitting leaving enough
room for you oto get a small wrench (I think 6 or 7 mm) on the base of the
zerk so you can turn it enough to release and engage as needed.

Have a friend slowly pump the pedal as you release the zerk fitting on the
slave cylinder.  (It is located on the top of the cylinder.)  Use a command
like &quot;DOWN!&quot; (very imaginative, eh?) and when he pushes, you loosen the
fitting.  When the pedal is on the floor, you tighten the fitting and say,
&quot;UP&quot;.  Do this over and over and over and over and over.  He will be able to
see the level of the reservoir and fill as needed.  Do it till there is no
air in the fluid stream.  The fluid should be CLEAR!  Keep filling till it
is.

BUT IF there is any doubt that the fluid is getting to the master cylinder,
before you crawl under the car and get all full of cooties, check the feed
line to the clutch master cylinder to eliminate the possibility of it being
obstructed.   Have a towel in hand and a small vice grip next to you on the
floor.  You can (hopefully, cuz these things are a bear to get off
sometimes) then twist and pull the line from the master and when it comes
free, the fluid will flow into the towel.  That's if it's O.K.  If it is
flowing and you messed up the end of the line and can't get it on the master
right away, pinch it off with the vice grip and go get a new line.  (Or just
grab the spare that you had handy. Heh, heh.)

If it isn't flowing put in a new line.  This will involve some spillage.
While you're at it, take a look at the condition of the reservoir.  If there
is a lot of black crap in the thing there is a possibility that you have the
same stuff (microbacterial contamination, or micro FOD) throughout the
system.  This can be detrimental to seals in the system.  Plan on a thorough
flush of the brake and clutch system about every two years to help prevent
this.


Have a blast,

&gt;After searching
&gt;the archives I'm hopeful that bleeding the system will fix me right up.
&gt;What I couldn't find is the answer to this question:  Can this be done
&gt;without a pressure bleeder?  How?
&gt;
&gt;Many TIA,
&gt;Erich Elmer
