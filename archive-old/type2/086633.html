Subject:  Re: [T2] RE: alternative heat source


&gt;Guys, what exactly is the flame/heat switch? Are we talking about a
sensing/detector type device?

A flame switch is a thermal switch with a long 4-5 inch probe on it. It's
pretty important as it tells the gas heater that the gasoline being pumped
into the heater is actually burning. If it doesn't warm up and open it's
switch the heater will shut off. If it's out of adjustment or not working
then no heat, although I did operate my BA6 once wit ha bad flame switck by
contantly turning it on and got pretty decent heat out of it.

I like Bobs idea of the oil burner flame switch. Never seen one as I have a
propane furnace, but my uncle works on oil burners. I'll have to pick his
brain.
