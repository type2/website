Subject: Re: [T2] F.I. to Weber carb conversion on a 2litre

John-

Now that everyone has had their say about the evils of  the Weber
conversion, I'll put in my nickel's worth.

I have a 74 bus running an AVP 1.8 ltr with a 32/36 DFEV center mounted
Weber for the past 40,000+ miles. This bus is my daily driver, in rain,
shine, snow, sleet, cold, and dark of night. Some days that's 20 miles round
trip to work, and some days it's 100 miles to work at the other plant. I've
also driven it to Missouri and Florida and Michigan and all the way to the
top of Lookout Mountain in all sorts of weather. I run regular gas and the
stock points-and-condenser setup in an SVDA distributor.

You're up near Cincinnati, right? I'm in western KY, about 3 hours west of
you 2 hours south. My bus never fails to start in any weather, delivers what
I consider to be reasonable power and performance, and I get 15 MPG in the
city, 20 MPG on the highway. If the intake has ever iced up, it wasn't
noticeable from the driver's seat. I have no complaints at all to lay at
Weber's door.

Is FI better? Maybe; I've never run FI on a bus, so I can't compare them. I
do know that the expense, not to mention the time and effort and learning
curve, is far more than I care to invest to replace a system that is
functioning quite well. That, and the fact that I've seen good used Weber
setups sell for less than the cost of one AFM.

Don't be afraid of the conversion, it works.

Regards,
Dave
