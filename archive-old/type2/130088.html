Subject: Re: [T2] Tightening Head bolts w/engine in bus

Well, the engine came out, the head bolts were tightened, and the engine 
went back in.  It's not running yet, but there is compression in #1 and #2, 
so I'm getting closer.

&gt;No kidding!  In order to get to the head bolts, the cylinder tin must come
&gt;off.  For the cylinder tin to come off the fan shroud and mainfold must
&gt;come off.  For the fan shroud to come off, the generator must come off.
&gt;For the mainfold to come off the generator and air cleaner must come off.
&gt;
&gt;In short, the engine has to come out to make all this happen easily.
