Subject: Trip Report/Bus won't start &quot;UPDATE&quot;

If anyone was following my last post I explained that my bus and I took
a 5 hour trip last weekend and after about 4 hours of continous driving my
bus would not start when turned off briefly.  It was as if my battery did
not have enough juice to turn the starter over, but the lights seemed fairly
bright.  This was after driving 4 hours at night with the heater fan and
windshield wipers on (a large electric draw).  By the way, my bus is a
'77 Westy with 2L FI engine.
I let the bus sit overnight and it still did the same no start thing.
Once again it seemed like a weak battery.  
I pulled the battery and charged it.
When I put it back in, the bus started right up.
I then made the return trip (4 hours) without my lights or windshield wipers
or heater fan on.  When I got to my destination and turned off the bus, it
started right up fine again.
Now, a few days later I notice substanial dimming of the headlights at night
(especially when first started cold) and also when I let the bus idle and
turn on my head lights, turns signals, windsheild wipers, and heater fan
the battery idiot light glows.
I believe that a healthy electrical system should be able to support 
all of the above things (lights, turnsignals, heater fan, windshield wipers)
similtaneously without a complete overdraw of the electricity put out by the
alternator.
So I propose:
1.  On my 4 hour drive at night with the fan and windshield wipers on, I used
up all of the electricity provided by my alternator and had to rely on back
up power provided by my battery.  After 4 hours, this drained my battery
enough to not start the bus.
2.  On my return trip, in the daytime, the alternator put out enough juice
to run everything plus give my battery the slow charge it needed to stay 
alive and start my car (after the trip)
3.  This of course means I have a dying alternator or voltage regulator.

Does this sound reasonable to anyone else.  I don't know a lot about the
electrical workings of my alternator/battery system, but this seems to make
sense.
What do you think?
