Subject: Re: [T2] '72 distributor in a '68

Thanks Karl, Richard and George for keeping this FART alive for the 
edification of us all. everytime we have this discussion I pick up a 
little bit more.  I had a '72 205 E that someone advised me to leave off 
the retard. I think it was Karl but not sure.  it ran OK in my '70 bus 
with modified type 1 engine but it was basically worn out.  with the 
last rebuild I have been running an 009 for a while but it gets old real 
quick.

 &gt;most if not all of the retard settings (5 ATDC, 10 ATDC, etc) have a 
vaccum can taylored to add
 &gt; retard to 7.5 BTDC (roughly). You can verify this in Bentley.

the 205E was similar to this.  ran pretty well at 8 BTDC set at idle, 
retard disconnected, but was worn out so timing jumped around enough so 
it wasn't really zen cruising. specs were as follows:

Bus &amp; Pickup 1972 * 1700
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-15deg Ret; Centrifugal: 
13-16deg _at_ 2000rpm, 23-26deg _at_ 3600 rpm

just last weekend I installed a 205AD:
Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose 
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-16deg _at_ 
2200rpm, 25-28deg _at_ 3900rpm

hmmm. . . looks like I should be setting this one at TDC?  right now I 
started out at about 8 BTDC, didn't seem that it would idle at less 
advance but maybe I need to reset my idle speed screws (Dellorto DRLA 
36's).  heads are running cool in general but. . . too late to tune it 
at the moment without waking up the neighbors.
