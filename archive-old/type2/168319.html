&gt; I got that auxillary fan that goes inline on your

&gt; Where did you buy it?  How much?  Where did you install it?

JC Whitney IIRC. I think it was about $50, but I think they want around $80
for it now.

I put it inline on the dict just before it splits up to the vent that heats
the cabin. It's not a quite little bugger, but it has 3 settings and BOY
does it defrost fast.

Next time I am under there, I will have to take a picture.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
