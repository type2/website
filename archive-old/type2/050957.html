Subject: [T2] suggestion for reoing poptops

I found a product called mar hyde paint at BOat US it is designed for marine
applications on wood and fiberglass, and to give a gelcoat like finish even when
not sprayed on, it gives great results, i rolled it on but plan on redoing it
even though the results are great. it is also relatively inexpensive, its
supposed to last 3-5 years in a marine environment..should last many more on the
road.
to see the results goto

it is so reflective that it really keeps the temps down in the sun, big
difference since i did it.
hope someone finds this helpful
