Subject: Re: [T2] Removing fan bolts?

Was asked:


 Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one who has the problems I
have..searching the archives didn't seem to turn up anything so here goes..

Is there any special trick to removing the 3 allen bolts that hold the fan
on a 1700cc?  I have a folding allen key set, perhaps they're not long
enough (not enough torque?).  I can get the wrench in ok, but it doesn't seem to want to turn.  The wrench
just kind of slips around..I also noticed that it doesn't seem to be a very deep hole.  I don't want to strip
these guys
since I can't imagine how i'd get them out if I did, so..any magical tips?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Which 3 bolts?

The ones holding the fan assembly to the hub that is bolted to the crank?

Or the ones holding the pulley to the fan?  #11

Or the ones holding the screen covering the fan?  #39
