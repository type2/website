Subject: Can someone look at a VW in Maine for me?

Last week, someone was asking about coming by a single cab, and someone 
posted the Maine VW club's For Sale site which had one listed (in 
Alabama) plus a nice KG for sale in Gorham, Maine

www.mainevwclub_dot_org/For-Sale.html

Is there someone on this list that could check it out for me?  Please 
p-mail me.  I had a '71 a few years back and hated to give it up.  If 
there is ANY way possible, I would like to negotiate on this one.

&quot;...at least I'm enjoying the ride.&quot;
