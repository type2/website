I've often heard that the easist way to lower the resale value of your car =
it to put a &quot;This Car Climbed Mt. Washington&quot; sticker on your bumper.

&gt;Dear Don:
&gt;
&gt;I've driven a numkber of cars on that road through the years raning 
&gt;from a Porsche 914, a Triump Spitfire, Fiat whatchamacallit and a new 
&gt;(at the time) 83 Toyota Corrolla.   All overheated or almost did and 
&gt;every one needed an oil change almost right after.
&gt;
&gt;Were I still living there,  I'd park the bus and take the Cog 
&gt;Railway.   I guess I've worked too hard to get this machine going and 
&gt;at 25 years of age it iis very maintenance intensive.  I want to save 
&gt;it for nice camping trips.   I think you'd be putting unnecessary 
&gt;wear and tear on an old engine to do this.
&gt;
&gt;My 2=A2!
