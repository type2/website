&gt;&gt;HOLD ON A MINUTE! DID YOU SAY   R  T  V SILICONE?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would not use that as a gasket sealer on anything related to body work
&gt;&gt;or sheetmetal. It causes an oxidation process that  will prematurely rust

&gt;It is a vicious corrosive. Somebody put it around my windshield and it made
&gt;my ROCKER PANELS rust through! And I think it is making my hair slowly turn
&gt;grey, too. That silicone is wicked, wicked
&gt;stuff.

 This hair thing - - I was gonna sue dad, thanks!

 I'm the one who told Lotus B to use silicone so I guess I must say
a few words in it's defense.

 What I like about it is the fact that it hardly sticks to anything,
except itself and glass, and I'm not too sure about glass.

 You asked for impervious and that's what you get. It just doesn't 
react with anything. 

 Actually, it's not impervious, helium for instance just walks right 
thru it.

 What it is close to, is Inert, Chemically.

 What it does do is conform to features it comes in contact with.
It gets right down in the surface pores, but not too well.

 So it seals good but it comes out relatively easy when needed.

 The catalyst is acetic acid as far as I know.

 Unless you had a reaction with substrate before it completes vulcanizing,
it shouldn't contribute to any kind of chemical reaction
of which rust be one.

 Frankly, if I wanted it to seal something for the next 20 years,
I'd use something else.     west
