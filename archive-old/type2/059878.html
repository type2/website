If anyone on the list would like a copy of page 43 from Just Kampers, just
let me know. It is too big to send to the server. So, if anyone would like a
jpg image showing those MUD FLAPS and various other items--like those SA
grills, then e-mail me for a copy.  Maybe, if enough people want to order
them, we could get a BIG discount. Something like BD did for us on those
HAYNES manuals. ANYONE from BD listening????
