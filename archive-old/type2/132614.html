Subject: Where do I list a 78 camper to sell?

I joined this type2 list because i thought it might be a good place  
for selling my 78 camper. But most of the conversation seems centered 
on repair problems and solutions. Can anyone tell me where i could go 
to list it?

This is my third VW camper. I've owned one or another for 38 years. I'm 
getting to old to work on them and I have an allergy to oil products.

Just in case someone is looking:
The engine was rebuilt 40,000 miles ago; the camper interior and canvas 
is in good shape. It has an automatic transmission.

I live on the Calif coast so it has a windshield rust problem. And 
before i got it, someone had stripped out the emission control stuff. 
It is for this latter reason I can't easily sell it in Calif.

If anyone is interested (I can post jpegs) or knows where I could list 
it, you could email me directly at:
