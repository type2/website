&gt;&gt;I may be wrong but if I remember correctly the vacuum part of the

&gt;&gt;When the throttle is snapped closed, you have a high vacuum, which pulls
&gt;&gt;on the diaphragm in the pressure regulator and opens the fuel return
&gt;&gt;line wider.  This lowers the fuel pressure and by doing that reduces HC
&gt;&gt;emissions on engine deceleration when there is no load and lots of fuel
&gt;&gt;is not needed.


Then Edward said:

&gt;vacuum range of the engine. (Try putting a pressure gauge one of the fuel
&gt;rails and you will see this). I don't see any reason why this would not
&gt;adjust the mixture to the engine dependant on vacuum (load).
&gt;
&gt;I have never seen in print the actual reason for the vacuum adjustment of
&gt;the fuel pressure. It is interesting to note that my Saturn has the exact
&gt;same setup with a pressure regulator that adusts pressure based on engine


Actually both are sort of correct, taking another look at the Bosch bible
yields the following wisdom.

&quot;As you know manifold pressure changes with throttle opening.  If fuel
pressure were constant for all manifold pressures, then at low engine loads,
with the throttle partially closed, reduced manifold absolute pressure would
increase fuel delivery.  To keep that relative pressure constant as the
throttle is opened and closed, the fuel pressure regulator is connected to
intake manifold by a vacuum hose.  Manifold pressure acts on the diaphragm
to hold relative pressure constant.&quot;

So what this is saying here is the relatively stupid old L-jet computer does
indeed figure for all its rights and purposes that the only way to change
fuel metering is electronic by modifying basic injector opening time based
on each of the parameters Sean professes.  Unfortunately as all engines are
pulling varying vacuum in the manifold if you want the DIFFERENTIAL pressure
between that in the manifold and that in the ring main to always be a
constant you can't keep the ring main at a constant 36 psi.  You want to
keep the difference constant because the analog computer knows how much fuel
gets flowed for such a time open always assuming delivery at such a pressure
differential at the tip of the nozzle.  If the pressure relative to
atmospheric or absolute depending on how you want to look at it is differing
in the manifold downstream of the throttle plate, the computer needs the
supply pressure to also differ.  The consequence of this affecting mixture
is purely secondary if you will, the computer affects the mixture by
changing time, but it makes the assumption that a constant amount of fuel
will flow in that amount of time for any engine operating state a condition
provided for by the regulator.

However for performance tuning using an adjustable rate regulator has been
an old favored trick to flow more gas for a higher performance engine, trick
is it needs to adjust with manifold vacuum again as you don't want overly
rich conditions at idle.  This gets particular favor as a trick for
turbocharging in the pre-electronic days where K-jet systems on Audi 5000's
used a special &quot;warm up&quot; regulator having a port sensing manifold pressure
and enriching on the top end.  Such regulators were used by people boosting
A1 cars in the 80's.  Same thing even in the Corrado days they sell 944
turbo regulators for highly overdriven G60's to provide more flow at higher
boost and airflow.

not all that smart but hey I just bought the book a couple of weeks ago and
its pretty good.
