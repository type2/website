Subject: re: cut off hose

Greg..my engine is from an auto- put onto my manual.  So, maybe this 
hose was meant to go an auto trans.? Anyone?

Hi Christopher,

Question: Is the brake pedal REALLY hard to press?

I would suggest you follow that hose to its source; my guess would be 
that it ends at the brake booster attached to the front of your master 
cylinder, just behind the front axle beam. Whoever installed the weber 
carb didn't know what to hook that hose up to, so they inadvertently 
disabled your power brakes. Hook that hose up to a suitable vacuum port 
and you'll be amazed at how much better your brakes work.

OTOH, since the 1973 auto tranny also needs vacuum, you might have a 
problem running power brakes and the auto tranny from a single carb. I 
know diddly about single carbs, so I'll shut up now and let someone 
with more experience put their $.02 in now.
