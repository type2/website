&gt; However I was under the impression platinum plugs were bad for the VW
&gt; engine?  List?

Platinum plugs are designed to work with modern electronic ignitions that
run larger voltages and gaps then the Kettering system in our buses.  My
theory is that the Kettering system needs the larger capacitance of the
big electrodes to build energy before firing.  Small electrodes will fire
sooner, before the coil magnetic field has a chance to collapse properly.

The same principle applies to lightning rods, but that is another story...
