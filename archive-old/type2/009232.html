Well, the first two orders I got did sort of have a problem: They
doubled the order. It was obviously just a paperwork problem , they had
not charged me for the extra parts. A few days after the first set of
parts got to me the next set came in too. If only I had known I would
have ordered only one jalose window seal and not 2 :)  Of course I did
not need 4. And I did send them back!
