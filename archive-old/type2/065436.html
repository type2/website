Patrick..Given all the restraints and conditions.   My recomendation would be to
sell the van and buy something closer to what you want...or vice versa.  It is a
lot of work to make major modifications  and very expensive too.  whereas you
could probably get as much for what you are driving as you'd have to pay for
what you want.     John Jensen in Annapolis
