Subject: employment, moving South, bus trip

I, too, find the employment thread very interesting. It's as if we were
briefly taking off our masks after a 5-year masked ball.  I'm an economics
prof, finishing a one-year visit at the Universite de Montreal and soon
moving South for a tenure-track position at the University of Alabama. Any
other bus folks out there, aside from Unca' Joel?

Sadly, my family and I will be driving South in our Passat. However, two
good friends of mine, both originally from France, will be driving the bus
&gt;from Montreal to Tuscaloosa during the last two weeks of July. Geraldine is
a biologist and Claire, my colleague, is a development economist and bona
fide *bus nut*. Back in France, she used to own a breadloaf camper (but has
since upgraded to a '91 non-Westy hightop Syncro).

I'm a bit concerned, though, as my bus's reliability has not yet been
thoroughly tested. As some of you may remember, I recently replaced the 1.8
liter fuel-injected T4 with the Flat-6 from a '71 Porsche 911. It only came
out of winter storage a couple of weeks ago and I already ran into a few
bugs that need attention (the carbs probably need a full rebuild, the
electrical work needs to be tidied up, etc.). However, it does go pretty
fast (how about 85 mph up the long incline leading to the Laurentian
mountains? :)

Anyway, I was wondering if I could perhaps set up a potential support
network along their travel route? From Montreal, they'll head towards NYC,
then continue towards Philadelphia, Baltimore, and DC. From there, they'll
work their way inlands, take the Blue Ridge towards Knoxville and on to
Memphis (Geraldine likes BB King), then South to New Orleans before ending
their 2-week trip in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Of course, recommendations on
where to stop, what to see, and where to camp would also be very much
appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,

Sami
