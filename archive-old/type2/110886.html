Subject: brake job update

I have not started the brake job yet. Thanks for all
the input btw. I removed all four tires, one at a time
(using jackstands all the while)and checking the
brakes. They all look good!!! The bad news is I did
the Muir check to look for slack in the wheels, as
well as listening for noise. On the passenger side
rear I found what I think is the culprit of the
growling noise that has me investigating. I think Muir
describes it as a &quot;pebbly tumbly&quot; noise when turning
the wheel when it is raised up off the ground. Loose
bearings I'm guessing. 
New question: Do I have to remove the drum brake
assembly to replace the bearings and races? If so, can
I just put the old shoes back on? I know some will
ask, &quot;well, how does all the hardware look?&quot; The
answer is, great. Even the star adjusters move! 
Any help would be appreciated. Sorry this was so
loooongg!
