Subject: Mexican Heads

I bought a set of mexican heads for my 68 westy about a year ago. Mine were 
the new factory ones, but had been modified for 40 &amp; 35.5mm valves. other 
than that, they are the same as yours I'm sure. They have the long reach 
spark plug hole which takes a type4 plug (W8CC instead of W8AC). I have put 
almost 30,000mi on these heads in one years time with no problems. I've 
experimented with other 3/4 reach plugs (like the triple electrode Jetta 
plugs) and found that the stock type4 plug is the way to go. You should be 
able to bolt them on with no problem. If the valves in your new heads are 
smaller than your old ones, you'll notice a small drop in performance, but a 
Bus ain't no road burner, or isn't supposed to be, anyway. Although 100mph in 
a bus is a rush, it's quite a hairy ride.
