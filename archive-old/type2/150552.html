&amp;gt; How do i put one of these LED lights in just to possible detour thieves?(and so it doesnt drain the battery? possibly on a toggle switch? maybe..? i have a external battery for that if so? how much power can a LED light take anyways?
&amp;gt; dont have the cash for the alarm but maybe hoped the blinking light would detour them away or thin the crowd....? we got some folks breaking into cars and hanging out around the vehicles late at night where i work...middle oof city..... right now affording the alarm isnt possible but do not want my fears to become a reality coming out of work one night...everything i worked for gone /// over someones lack of responsibilites and choices.....

Look at the wiring loom coming out of the ignition switch.  On my '71 I
found an unconnected wire that actually had voltage on it only when the
key was off!  Perfect for the application you anticipate.

All you have to do is get a super-bright red LED with a dropping resistor
for 12V.  Wire it between the hot terminal and ground and you'll be in
business.  One LED will run continuously for many days without depleting
the battery excessively.
