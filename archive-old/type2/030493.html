hello all,

this is something i've thought through quite a bit.

and my conclusion was that the best bet for parts availability is a 71
bus.

it has the beetle motor which is still being produced in many parts of teh
world.

It also has most other mechanical parts in common with the kombi still
produced in mexico.

So, i figure when these two vehicles go out of production then i'll start
to worry about spares availability.

about the only things hard to find are trim items and rubber items that
dont match what is on the new busses (i/e some window rubber etc.)

peas,

Steve

p.s. 71 front breaks are a 2 year only item so i got the brakes of a newer
bus, just havent put em on yet.  These are the same as are currently in
mexican production, and are the same as 73-85 us production.(80-85 take
different spindles but rotors and calipers are basically the same)
