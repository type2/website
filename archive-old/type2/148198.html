Subject: Re: [T2] Pressure Relief Valve 74 Westy

That spinning cover is an interesting dilemma. You are going to have
to get it out in order to repair it. Either the cap or the case is
stripped and will have to be fixed. You are going to have to figure a
way to apply downward pressure to the cap as you unscrew it, perhaps
prying the edges with a screwdriver. Or expoxy a bolt or something to
it and pull down as you unscrew. Or drill it and tap it to get a bolt
into it.

I wouldn't worry about the valve. It's above the spring that will fall
out when you get the cap off.

 Thanks for the info.  Knowing that, I need to take care of the spinning
 nut dilemma.  If the valve is inside, and the nut is spinning, how
 would I go about fixing this?  I can't seem to pull it out or tighten it.
 Also, how is there a trick to  accessing the valve? Then once it's
out I guess I
 need to check the valve, retap the hole (?), and reinstall it.
