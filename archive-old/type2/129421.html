Subject: Re: [T2] Alternate Engine Removal Procedure

Someone else just posted their procedure that was similar.  I liked 
their use of the pulleys.  Then, for more safety, take the end of the 
rope and wrap it around something for friction as the engine is lowered. 
  I was the vice grips that scared me.  Get a hand caught under there 
and things could get ugly.

Also, instead of wrapping the engine, why not just go to the two holes 
at the front and back of the engine.  I believe that someone else on the 
list verified that they could carry the weight of the engine.

however, like you said, you had to get the job done and came up with a 
solution that worked for you.  Kudos! ;)

&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I've used the floor jack before, and it has worked great.  However, I 
&gt; have 2 big problems with that method:
&gt; 1. Balancing the engine while raising/lowering.
&gt; 2. Getting the engine from the bottomed-out floor jack to the ground.
