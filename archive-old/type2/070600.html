Subject: 30 pict 2 adjustment questions

What could be simpler? There is only one screw to adjust. The Bentley 
says turn it clockwise till idle drops off and than turn it 
counterclockwise until the motor reaches its highest obtainable idle. 
Then adjust the idle screw on the arm to get it back to about 850 rpm.

Here is the question. What is the screw doing ? Is it allowing more 
air to mix with fuel or more fuel to mix with air or is it increasing 
a the volume of a predetermined air fuel mix to the idle circuit? To 
put it another way, is turning the screw in one way or another 
richening or leaning out the mixture? Also it this only  in effect at 
idle or throughout the RPM range?


I adjusted mine per the Bentley and now I have a flat spot which was 
not there before.

Thanks
