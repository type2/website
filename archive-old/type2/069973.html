&gt;But who cares?  Engines get hot.  Keep your tin airtight, and your oil
&gt;changed and topped off, and we won't have to worry until millions of
&gt;years
&gt;hence when there's so much entropy that our existance is totally fractal.

I think we can all agree on this.

However, Eric, you have it backwards.  Compression heats things up,
*expansion* cools them.  Fridges compress freon, cool it to room temp,
then expand it inside the fridge which causes it to absorb heat from the
interior and deposit outside the fridge.  There is no real sooling taking
place, just some movement of heat around.
