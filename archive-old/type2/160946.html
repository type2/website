Subject: Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator with 34 pict 3

I found this in the Samba groups which might have some good info
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=177529. I think the three
easiest are A. Find the alternator version linkage,  B. Grind the
alternator, but stack some gaskets under the carb so you don't have to grind
as much off, C. Make your own spacer by cutting the carb mounting surface
off a trashed manifold and filing the bottom flat. Good luck!
