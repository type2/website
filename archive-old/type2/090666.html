Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus competition

Ditto about Terry.  I have totally enjoyed everyone's comments.
Will and I must have posted our questions at the same time - I think they are 
very similar - we could combine this into the same thread?
I plan not to paint metallic.  My bus is also bondo-ed by the po.  And parts 
were painted with a brush.  
Thanks!

---------- Original Message -----------
&gt; Basically though I don't know anything about the pro process, but I have
&gt; started on the back end of the bus:  stripping, bondoing, sanding, priming
&gt; with rattle can, and sanding some more.  Soon I will step up to 
&gt; Variprime, and whats the brand of filler primer?   Top coat will be 
&gt; a VW/Porsche color called Aquablue metallic.  Does anybody know who 
&gt; makes it?
&gt; 
&gt; List: is there a book that might help me out here, on tips and tricks?
&gt; 
&gt; I also need to know what to buy for an air line dryer.
