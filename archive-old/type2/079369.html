Subject: Re: [T2] Nailing livestock was Re:[T2] front mounted tires.

Central Jersey is deer central, and I've struck a small doe with our
Nussan Quest and a large Buck.  $1200 and $1500 damage mostly to the
radiator, air conditioning and front plastic bumper, and the hood in the
case of the buck.  I've never had an accident with the 78 Westy; our
theory is that the bus air cooled engine is noisy enough to alert deer,
and we cqan see better if they are trying to cross ahead.  I advise even
those with rustbucket busses to carry comprehensive insurance as it's
cheap and if you nail a deer, they will pay for the repair/replacement
at no premium surcharge, but if you nail a tree trying to avoid the
deer,  YOU pay and if you have collision, there will be a premium
surcharge!  Since I know someone who was killed trying to avoid the
deer, I can say it is better to hit the deer than a tree!

&gt; A thousand pounds is a thousand pounds.  Doesn't matter if it's meat or
&gt; concrete.  A few years ago I knocked over a medium sized doe.  Hit her
&gt; at about 5 mph. Pushed the nose of the bus in about four inches.
