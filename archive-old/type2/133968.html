Subject: wolfsburg west seat pads, 68-74 

So I had a go at rebuilding the driver's side seat on my 74 Westy
yesterday afternoon, helped by Richard Atwell's excellent photo essay. The
hair pads on the driver's backrest had entirely disintegrated, along with
most of the cloth material that covers the pad. I obtained the hair seat
pads from Wolfsburg West for this job.

Things for the most part went smoothly. The bottom pad fit perfectly,
cover nice and snug, no problems. 

The backrest pad, however, appears to fit differently than the original,
and the seat cover is quite tight. The cover is taut across the backrest
(not flush to the pad), and the top edge of the pad seems to come up
higher and wider than the original, making it nigh well impossible to
finish the seat cover attachment of the front plaid fabric (it pulls
through the crack between the seats, then wraps up and is secured to the
back of the seat with the metal triangular tabs, the same set of tabs that
secures the vinyl rear part of the seat back cover. 

Comparing it with my original passenger seat, which didn't yet require
rebuilding, it just seems different. The sides of the passenger seat are
thicker, the overall pad slightly shorter, etc. Perhaps this is just a
factor of having the fabric shrink after years of a disintegrated
backrest, but it would have been nice to be able to attach all parts of
the seat cover (not that it's going anywhere). 

Anyone else have similar difficulties with the backrest portion on a 68-74
bus? 

Thanks
