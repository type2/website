&gt; Hello again, Im looking into checkint out the spray pattern of my injectors,
&gt; but the book (yes I read the book) seems a bit unclear to me and I want to be
&gt; as safe as possible......
&gt; So has anyone found any nice safe ways to check to spray pattern???

if it is NOT in the engine you can use water., spray onto a piece of paper
and you will see the spray pattern.
