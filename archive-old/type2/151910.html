&gt; C'mon VW - don't do this fad car thing again. Fads never last and why

&gt; Build something versatile. Of course we all know it is going to cost
&gt; $30K so for me it's a moot question of whether I will ever own one.
&gt; T'ain't worth it...

this is the on again/off again/now on again microbus wannabe???

  Why can't them make a nice utility vehicle,, an empty box with a nice
basic comfortable drivers compartment.  and try bringing it in under 20k

ah well keep the 78 running
