&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Seems that my engine cranks slower every day, so I believe I am in
&gt; the
&gt; market for a new battery for my '79 :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any recommendations?  Besides Optima which everyone will
&gt; obviously recommend :-)

I've done well with the 60 or 72 month batteries from Pep Boys or
Kragen/Schucks/Checker.  These batteries are probably made by Exide.

I always insist upon batteries with removable caps.  &quot;sealed&quot; batteries
(except for the Optima and aircraft gel-cells) aren't really sealed. 
They release gases while charging, and those gases have to come from
somewhere, hence the need to replenish water now and then.

Often, the size listed in the FLAPS' book is the &quot;bug&quot; battery, which
is sized to go under the back seat of a bug.  I don't know what came
originally in a bus, but an ordinary Type 24 battery fits mine nicely
and has more cranking capacity.

When changing the battery, it's high time to refurbish the battery
tray.  If it is rusty/corroded/whatever, take the time to neutralize
the acid with baking soda solution and repair the damage.

I like to use petroleum jelly on the terminals and clamps.  Give
everything a thin coat of jelly and assemble.  No terminal corrosion
problems at all!

Have fun!
George Lyle
