Subject: Re:Replacing battery tray
Message-ID: &lt;370258FA.8DBCD7F_at_net-link_dot_net&gt;

I am just wrapping up the bodywork on my '76 Westy using a bunch of new panels ordered from Das
Bulli Haus.  They work pretty hard at their main business, but always took the time to return my
phone messages in the late evenings.  Their panels were great; good fits and heavy gage.  I would
not hesitate to order from them again.

Anyway, one of the repairs that I made was to replace both of the existing rusty battery trays.  I
removed the tail light assemblies for access to the tray, and performed all of the work through this
opening.  I would suggest a long sleeved shirt for the nex step, since I tore up my arms pretty good
on the edges of the opening.

I used a 3 inch cut off tool in my air die grinder and cut all the way around the existing battery
tray as close to the outer bus wall as I could get.  This leaves a strip of metal spot welded around
the compartment.  I cut through this strip about every 3 inches and wrapped the metal around a pair
of wire cutters like you open a can of sardines.  You can buzz partially through the strip over the
spot welds to make it easier to pop them off.  On the part of the tray that is attached to the outer
skin of the bus, you can sand off the paint around the beltline which makes the spotwelds visible,
then drill them out.

Once everything is out and the inner areas smoothed out, it's time to insert the new trays.  If your
motor is still in you might convince yourself that there's no way to get the new tray in without
cutting it into little pieces, but on about the 200th try you'll find the angle and it will slip
home.  Tap it square and level and plug weld with your favorite welding process.

Put down an acid neutralizing blanket from the FLAPs and promise yourself you'll inspect this more
frequently in the future so you never have to do this again!
