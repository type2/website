&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Might be a good way the weather the sudden increases in fuel prices too.

There is a lot of room under the bus for fuel tanks.  You might think of
putting a marine polyethelene fuel tank there.

There's a couple of tanks that are only 7&amp;quot; tall, which would leave lots of
clearance under the bus.

&amp;gt;    You could pull a John Denver who, during the 1979 gas &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot;, tried to
&amp;gt; fill his 2000 gallon underground tank with black market gas so he could
&amp;gt; keep driving his Jeep around the green, green hills... ;-(

Actually, it was avgas for his Stearman, so he could keep getting his
Rocky Mountain High over Colorado.  Funny how that Denver's little faux
pas keeps popping up!
