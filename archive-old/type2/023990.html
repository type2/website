Hi everybody - 

This is my first post to the list, HOW THE HECK ARE Y'ALL?!  I have a '73 bus
that I brought home from Colorado (home is Chicago).  I now have a good enough
job to start fixing it up, but I am missing some of the little things that
make it complete inside.  

I have purchased new interior panels (mine only came equipped with passenger
side panel), but I need the door lever covers, a new door lever for the inside
passenger side (chrome) and some other minor things that attach to the panels.
If anyone has anything, please let me know.

Also, does anybody know of any VW junkyards in the Chicago area?  

Thanks!
Michelle
