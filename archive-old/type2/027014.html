I have a 009 in my '76 type 4 and it works great.  Just added a pertronix 
electronic ignition and it runs like a charm.  Easier than adjusting points, 
and should last forever.

&gt;Hello, can anyone out there tell me how you determine if
&gt;a distributor is worn out?
&gt;Also, I replaced the stock vac adv distributor on my '72
&gt;with a 009 (on the advice of the parts guy at a local
&gt;shop). I have since heard/been told that the 009 has the
&gt;wrong advance characteristics for busses. Mine seems to
&gt;run ok though gas mileage is nothing to write home
&gt;about.
