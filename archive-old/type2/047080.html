Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Bus Depot? :(

i think someone should kill this thread or take it up
in private.  bus depot supplies a lot of us with
quality parts for our bus. sometimes it gets to us
fast, other times slow, it is a company like any other
and is not perfect.  seeing ron is a listee i think we
should drop it instead of hitting him with all of our
&quot;this happened to me&quot;...good or bad...stories
just my $.02
