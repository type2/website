The early Westy's had a 3 piece windshield cover. 2 permenant sliders along
the doors and then a snap-in windshield &quot;only&quot; curtain. I think the plaid 3
piece went from 67-70. And then the 71-73 had the plaid one piece curtain.
Of course 70 probably had some of both.

I have one of these original plaid windshield &quot;only&quot; curtains I am going to
raffle off at Everybus, all proceeds to go to the Jonothan Walker fund.

present to win raffle ticket.

My 1970 Westy has original curtains.  The front curtains are indeed a one
piece with snaps.  This covers the front bay, driver and passenger window.
It uses stretch on top.
Not sure what your Westy used...
