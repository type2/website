Subject: RE:  Engine races when brakes applied

Sounds like you are sucking air through the brake servo diaphragm.


&gt;I finally got my new engine installed into my 71 bus, and everything is
going
&gt;OK, but the one big problem I'd like to solve is that my engine races when
I &gt;apply the brakes.  Some details:  1600DP with dual Kadrons, vacuum assist
disc &gt;brakes.  I synched the carbs, but maybe they're not set at the right
mixture &gt;level???  The problem gets worse when the engine is fully warmed
up.  Also, I &gt;have a VDO tach, and it doesn't seem to be reading correctly
at low RPM, like &gt;at idle.  The engine sounds about right, but the tach is
reading between 2000-&gt;3000 RPM.  Anyone have any clues?
