Subject: Re: [T2] The best thing about Xmas shopping in a VW!!

Oh, Rob!

Isn't this a picture of the good old days? Not an suburban assault 
vehicle or a Dodge Durango in sight!

If you ask me, the subject heading for this should be: the best thing 
about Xmas shopping in 1965. Of course, you couldn't get an iPod or a 
CD back then.

For all of the identification of VW buses with hippy-ness, those of us 
who own them today really are reactionaries in our own way.
