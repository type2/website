Subject: 4 Wheel Alignment Needed
Mime-Version: 1.0

Anybody in Houston able to tell me where to go to get same?

OR.........

I depart Houston this Friday to go to the midwest for 7-8 weeks, and a 
bit into the Eastern seaboard.

I can hunker down in any one of several cities to have this work done,
if anybody,
in some certain city,
knows of an alignment shop that does VW bus work of this type 
especially well.

Actually, my main problem is positive camber on the left rear tire.
All else seems fine from apparent tire wear, but who knows.
