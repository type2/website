Subject: RE: [T2] EveryBus Carabus Question - Fuel Prices

You guys should check http://www.flyingj_dot_com you can look up gas prices by
state. I alwas use this site to plan my gas stops, there are several
&quot;Flying-J&quot; truck stops on the way down to EB..

For example here is the Ohio Gasoine prices
http://www.flyingj_dot_com/fuel/gasoline_CF.cfm?state=OH

GOOD luck..

I'm going to try to make it but it looks like the TaxMAn may be taking my
travel money...
