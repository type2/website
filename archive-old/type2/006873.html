Morning all,

Well we are no longer bus owners. The Wayback Machine left Las Vegas on a
trip to her new home in Portland, Oregon. Just got a note from Andrea and
Roger saying that it was a long drive but they made it just fine. 

I have a Mr. Swampy -- that they didn't need in Oregon -- for sale as well
as a brand new Solex for a '71. I didn't grab the PICT number but know it
was the model for a '71. Make an offer on either and I'd be happy to ship
them.

I'll be leaving the list. It's provided a lot of great help over the years
and I've made a lot of e-friends -- and even met some of them in Mammoth!
I've been asked to leave my site up by lots of folks and so I will. 

Good driving,

Scott
