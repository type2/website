Hi, 

Perhaps some of the European list members can help out with this. I have seen many References to Helsinki and Berlin Model Westfalia campers. I have not run across very much info on them. In the US, 1968 to 1973 model year the Westfalia campers were SO 67 which is more or less like the old split SO 42. There were some changes in detail but the layout was the same. In 1974 there was a complete change US Westfalia camper and it was offered in two versions: DeLuxe and Standard. The main difference being that the Deluxe had a propane system for the stove and a fixed side seat with storage underneath. For 1976 the layout again changed to the final (even the Vanagons are basically the same) version - again in standard and Deluxe. Deluxe in this case offering a propane system for cooking, electriacl system with extra battery and charging system as well as AC/DC fridge.

Helsinki models from what I can tell were SO69 but I could be wrong. For those just joining us an SO69 has the closted behind the driver (LHD)jumpseat along the left wall, a full length Z bed, AC/DC/propane fridge behind the passenger bulkhead. SO69 seem to have come in walkthru and bench front seat versions. The bench version had a propane stove as well. In fact the only two Westfalias with Dormobile tops I have seen in the US are both setup this way. The interior is somewhat like the SO44 splittie interior.

I have seen reference to Helsinkl conversions to buses as late as 1978 so that blows my SO69 theory. 

I have not seen any pics of what a Berlin looks like but have seen reference to it for most of the baywindow production run. I have also run across a reference to a Mosaic bay window conversion. For splits that generally refers to camper interiors that were bought as kits from the VW dealership and installed in passenger models by the owner of the bus. Anybody have a brochure on that?

It is getting a bit confusing but I love this sort of stuff. I was looking at a website the other day and ran across a pic of a 1974 Westfalia for sale in Belgium. It had a cabinet behind the drivers seat that was full height, had a door like the hanging closet of an SO69 but it also appeared to be attached to a small sink cabinet that was closer to the walkthru section. There was evidence of clean carpet where the fridge had been. I have also seen reference to a 1975 Wesrty setup the same way that had a 3 way fridge as wall as Westfalia installed floor furnace.

I would really like to see interior pics of European Westfalia interiors along with descriptions of what the models mean.Any body have any scans of Euro version Westfalia brochures of manuals or even better the VW dealership Westfalia parts book? 

Thanks
