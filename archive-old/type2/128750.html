Hi John,

One more thing, since other replies seem to have covered all the other 
bases: Try swapping the coil.

My Westfakia was stumbling at high throttle earlier this summer, but 
the problem never occurred in the driveway.  Thought it might have been 
the AFM, but swapping that out didn't help either. Wasn't vacuum leaks 
either.

At some time in the FI install I probably left the ignition on for too 
long and fried the coil. On a hunch I threw a crusty old spare in that 
I had laying around and the bus has been purring like a kitten ever 
since.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
