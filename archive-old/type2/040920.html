Subject: '74 fridge wiring

I have a '74 (?) dometic fridge I bought from a listee about 2 years ago. I
also have a converter of about the same vintage, purchased from another
listee. The converter works.

My problem is that I can't figure out how to hook up the fridge. There are
only two wires leading into it: one blue; one black. I tried tracing the
wires to determine which is ground, but I'm not having any luck.

I looked at Sami's wiring diagram for a '78 westy, but a lot of it just
doesn't apply.

Some clues might be:

-- the black wire splits and goes as a pair of wires to a canister-type,
which has tubing leading in and out and insulation wrapped about it. I
presume this is the thing that heats the coolant.

-- at the base of the canister is a screw which *might* be for a ground. It
seems to have too much paint on it to serve this purpose, but it's a
possibility.

-- the black wire also appears to go into a resistor--though I'm not sure
it's a resister. From this device, there is also a thin copper tube, which
I presume leads to the thermostat. The blue wire just goes into this
resister/whatever-it-is-device.

At this point I'm hoping to just find out where to hook up positive and
negative wires from the converter. I'll figure out something for a switch
panel later. Right now I don't have an auxiliary battery anyway.

Any help would be appreciated. I don't want to just experiment and hook
this thing up haphazardly, as I don't want to fry any electronics in the
fridge. 

Thanks! Joe
