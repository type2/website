I'd recommend the perusal by a fitting shop witht he correct optical
instruments as well (I think they are called &quot;Optiflex&quot;).

But another thing it could be is that one of your tyres is distorted. I had
this once, not on a Bay window bus but another VW Van, and the vehicle
pulled stronly to the right. When we swapped over the tyre, it pulled the
other way. The mechanic with his keen eye spotted the distortion, but I
couldn't see it! However when the tyre was replaced, all was well (I had had
the tracking and wheels balanced at the time).

&gt; &gt;I've noticed that my '76 bus pulls to the right a little bit as I drive.
&gt;
&gt; The Haynes manual gives some help on this, and there's some things you can
&gt; do yourself like taking up slack on the steering box and replacing ball
&gt; joints, but the actual adjustments need proper instruments.
&gt;
&gt; Don't know about where you are but I got a tyre shop to balance the wheels
&gt; and check the steering geometry and it was only about 12 pounds UK ($20)
and
&gt; well worth it.
