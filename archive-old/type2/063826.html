Subject: Colors for original Westy upolstery

Does anyone know of the original different color choices offered for the
Westy interior?  I know mine is the off yellow variety but were their others?
 off-white?  black?

I'd like to stick to stock when I redo my vinyl but I don't know it I will
want to go with the yellow.  I kind of like the idea of black or an
off-white.  What are some other routes people have taken?  Besides the
obvious tie-dyed tee-shirt slip covers and bandana curtains a-la Grateful
Dead interior?
