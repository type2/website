&gt; What about swamp coolers, such as the Swampy (

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like it might make the heat more tolerable....also sounds
like it would

&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have experience with one of these?

I haven't used this unit, but I have used quite a number of
evaporative coolers, both stationary and mobile.

Evaporative &quot;swamp&quot; coolers work on the priciple that it takes heat to
evaporate water.  This is apparent to anyone who steps out of a
shower.  You get chilly because the water on your skin evaporates,
drawing heat energy from your skin to do so.

You might have noticed that you don't get nearly as chilly if you stay
in a steamy room.  This is because the air is saturated with water and
cannot evaporate any additional water from your body.

Evaporative coolers evaporate water with the heat from the air passing
through the cooler.  The more water the cooler evaporates, the more
heat is removed from the air and the colder the air gets.  Under ideal
conditions, the air from the cooler can be 20 degrees cooler than the
air going in.

Ideal conditions are those found in a desert.  Low humidity is a must
for proper swamp cooler operation.  A swamp cooler won't do any good
on a hot muggy day, so those in Florida should save their money.

If you insist on strict temperature control, a swamp cooler also won't
meet your needs.  They cool things down, but it's hard to maintain an
exact temperature.  My home unit keeps things between 75 and 85
degrees, which keeps me comfortable.

Swamp coolers need constant airflow to work properly.  They replace
the air in the living space every few minutes.  You don't want a
tightly sealed living space.

Swamp coolers won't cause the living space to become overly humid,
since they have only a short time to evaporate water into the air.  If
the air is already nearly saturated it simply won't pick up any more
water.  The humidified air always goes to a warmer living area, so
water cannot condense in the living space.  The only corrosion concern
you have is from leakage of the swamp cooler itself.

One mobile swamp cooler I definitely _don't_ recommend is the Pla-Cool
unit sold for campers and trailers.  The overall quality is low, the
plastic will deteriorate within a couple of years in the sun, and it
_will_ leak.

I hope that this info is of some value to you.
