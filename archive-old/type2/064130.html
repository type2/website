Subject: Re: oh my! not bosch filters too!

        I have heard of oilfilters exploding, but not for brand specific 
reasons. Rather it has seemed to be operator error. Considering the dark 
and dirt at the bottom of most engines, it is reatively easy to leave the 
thick rubber gasket on the engine. When the old and new gaskets are 
stacked, depending upon design, flow is compromised, and pressure buids 
up. I've heard this is a common problem with untrained workers at quick 
lube shops.
