peter,
hi there.  most of the manuals out there such as the
idiots guide will have more of a maintence base
instead of being geared towards the aftermarket camper
companies.  there are quite a few books out there that
will have some camper info.  with you being in the
northwest and having a pop top that goes straight up,
i am assuming you have a riviera camper conversion. 
as far as online resources, i believe i have found
almost all the websites dealing with these campers and
have a page with all the links on it.  you can see it
at:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcampin/asirivieralinks.html
im sure there are some listees up in your area who
would have quite a bit of info on these as well,
especially the members of the WetWesties.  hope it
helps.  happy friday all
shelby

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm Peter in Portland, OR, USA
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know if anyone has any
&gt; reccomondations for the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What's the best manuel for '78 campers?  I have
&gt; the Idiot's Guide and it really seems to be tailored
&gt; to earlier busses....anything that has pics of my
&gt; style pop-top (straight-up top)?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Are there any good online companies that sell
&gt; reasonable interior kits (upholstery kits, curtains,
&gt; etc.)?  
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Any good Internet resources for Campers only?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help you can provide!
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Peter
&gt;
