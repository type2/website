Subject: Valve adjustment

&gt; I am planning on doing my first valve adjustment sometime this week on my
&gt; Riveria. I am going on a trip this weekend and thought I would double check
&gt; a few things before departing. I was just wanting to confirm the size of the
&gt; gap on the valves for a type 4 1800cc with dual carbs. I know a type 1 is
&gt; .006&quot; but I just wondered if it is the same on the type 4. 

Some may dispute this, but I learned that (1973 1700cc) intake valves
are set to .006&quot; and exhaust to .008&quot;. Because we also can't come to
consensus as what consitutes &quot;moderate drag&quot; on the feeler gauge, I
swear by go/no-go feeler gauges. A small prybar with a plastic handle
(i.e., door panel puller) is helpful for removing and replacing the wire
bails.

&gt; Also is there
&gt; anything else I should be looking for while I'm under the bus?

Make sure you've got all your lower tin! The first VW mechanic I took my
bus to after I got her didn't catch this. The second did, and
fortunately for me he had a lower right tin handy. Otherwise, the push
rods were all exposed and vulnerable to who knows what getting kicked up
on the road, and it couldn't be good for the cooling.
