Subject: just purchased a 70 Bus and have some questions

Hi all,

Thanks for the help so far. I finally bit the bullet and purchased a 70 
bus and now I have a few questions. I am in Savannah, Ga and am going 
up to Trenton New Jersey to pick up this bus. I am going to be driving 
it back approx 750 mile trip. It's in driveable condition, but I would 
like to take some precautions do you have any suggestions? Also I would 
like to get the oil changed before I start the trip, is this something 
I have to go to a specialist for or can just about anyone do it? Can 
anyone recommend a good mechanic who can take a look at the bus in 
Trenton or near there to either give it a once over and oil change?

Thanks for your help, I'm sure I'm going to have a ton more questions.


Blake
