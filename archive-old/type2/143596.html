&gt; Hi Dean,
&gt;
&gt; Well then I guess we'll just have to hope that as it went to its 
&gt; final resting place it took a weber single with it; leaving the FI or 
&gt; carb parts behind for the rest of us.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails,

If you've ever seen the original &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, the bad guys
(the Italian mobsters) push a few of the good guys' (the Eng-
lish mobsters) cars over a cliff...But even action film makers
have limits...The silver Aston Martin is pushed to the edge
(here's the part where a good VCR/DVD player comes in),
but it's a silver Lancia that takes the dive... ;-(
