Subject: FISH Any way to ship economically from Germany? Fish

Hi Robert,

I am looking at some bulky items on German eBay and I was 
trying to find a way to ship them back to Canada 
economically... without going the David Marshall container 
full route.

Apparently German Post is very expensive. Also, several 
eBaybers in German are reluctant to ship outside Germany. 
Do you know of a German mail / freight forwarder who would 
ship medium sized items (folding seat / window) to Canada?

Any other ideas?

Thanks,
Chris
