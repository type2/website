Subject: Re: Yellow touch up paint for '76

Even if you can't get the paint in spray cans, Pre-Val (?) makes a DIY spray 
container.
It consists of a small glass jar attached to a propellant can. If the auto 
paint store
matches the paint, it can be loaded into this sprayer for touch ups. It might 
take two
stops- auto paint and then a regular paint store - to get the job done.
