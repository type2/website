&gt; I just spent 15 minutes on Tire Rack's web site and most tires in that size 
&gt; have a max load of 1510lbs.

I just bought the Bridgestone Turanza tires in 205/70-15 from tirerack.  They 
are 44psi max which I think is more important than the load rating.  205 is 
plenty wide for bus.  I think 215 is too wide.  Wider tires have more rolling 
resistance.  They would also not clear well with chains.

If you order passenger car tires from tirerack, don't tell them you are using 
them on a bus.  They won't sell them to you for liability reasons.  Tell them 
that they are for a Dodge Caravan or something similar.
