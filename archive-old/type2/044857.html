Subject: [T2] owners manual swap

I've got an owner manual for a 72, that I was hoping to trade for a 68(single 
cab, is there a different book?) owner manual. would prefer to trade for one 
in like condition. 
Or if you're David Martin and bought a new 72 bus in NC. and want the book 
back(sorry I sold the bus years ago) let me know.
