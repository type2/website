&gt; I'd suggest starting the inspection by making sure the carb is firmly
&gt; mounted on the manifold, and that there's actually a gasket in there.  The
&gt; mounting bolts don't have to be very loose for air to be drawn in through
&gt; that interface.
&gt;
&gt; The carburetor body casting material is 'relatively' soft.  It's not unusual
&gt; for an improperly mounted carb to have a slight arc across the base.  This
&gt; is the result of overtightening of the mounting bolts when a too thick, too
&gt; soft, or incomplete gasket was used.  Less common is carb base distortion
&gt; because of being mounted on a manifold with an arced mounting flange.
&gt;
&gt; If base distortion is bad enough the lower part of the carb throat can be
&gt; ovaled and the throttle butterfly may be sticking or unable to move/function
&gt; properly.  A carb with an ovaled throat is beyond repair.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW.....

Fred:
I don't know who started this thread, but something else that might cause this
34pict
problem is that pesky soft plug falling out. Maybe someone should write more
about this since at this time there are no archives to refer back to.
