Brad,
I found that the inside of the throttle valve housing gets grungy after a 
while, because of exhaust gas recirculation I suspect. Then the valve get 
sticky and won't close all the way, particularly as it warms up. I wasn't 
sure if you tried cleaning that, but just in case I pass this along.
