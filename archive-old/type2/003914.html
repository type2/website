     Hi All. I've been away for awhile and am just catching up on List mail.
I was in Belize for a week but didn't see any aircooleds. A couple of newer
VW pickups .
I'm waiting for an order from BD so I tore apart the r/h stock solex carb
and pulled the throttle shaft.
I knew there was a lot of play and wanted to investigate it. I can see 2
small brass bushings less than 1/8 in wide in the throttle plate bores. Can
I remove and replace these and if so where can I get them?
I can see I'll have to smooth out the shaft and ream the bushings. ANy probs
here?

Thanks
Phil Gowdy
