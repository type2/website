Subject: Re: [T2] 68-73 Westy Closet/Cabinet mods.


&gt;Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy and 
&gt; &gt;shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear 
&gt; &gt;window.

Yes Sir Adam has the right Idea, I'm sure a lot of Volks thought the same.  
So I went ahead and done it ;&gt;) Just got done doing just that not very long 
ago. I too like the visibility and yes I have the storage needed.

My modification is not quite finished but what I did was repanelled the 
cabinet (closing off the door) using brass screws and stained it red 
mahogany.  Access to the storage space is from the top(A), I used square 
stock (====)to hold the hatch made from some nice wood
9 3/4&quot;wide.
                    C_______D______
               B   /===============]
      __A_____,___/                ]
     [============    _____________]
     [               /
     [              /
     [_____________]

I cut the front (A) lower equal to the armrest on the left of the z-bed, 
this I hinged with brass(B), problem here was the slope of the window so I 
had to cut a good inch a lot the hatch still can't open it all the way but 
enough.

The rear portion using the same plank, is cut right up to the window (D)here 
I had a heck of a time getting the curve just right. I placed the square 
stock deeper and a handle on the top plank so it can be removed, no way at 
all to hinge here because of the curve at the back and the slope of the 
glass.

The Cabinet stays in place pretty good but it is or will be attached to the 
bus just behind the front hatch hinges and the panel that closes the opening 
(c)at the up slope between the front and the back.

The hardest thing I'm haveing to deal with is a good looking crowning to the 
cut wood, nothing from the original works cause you can't see it and that 
never mattered on the original !

I'm proud of what I've done so far and have hopes of repanelling all 
surfaces, so far so good!  Seating is so much more comfy holds beer better 
and even has a place for writing.

Good luck gang!  Hope ta see ya at Every buss 2002!  You Snow Gooses will 
know me this time, I'll be showing off my cabinet mod....
