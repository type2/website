Subject: RE: [T2] Need a little gel coat counsel

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can live with it but I read something about wax? Is that what
gives the shine?&lt;&lt;&lt;

Hmm, interesting question. I don't know if you CAN make gelcoat nice by
applying it like that. How it's done on the large scale (that I've seen
anyway) is that they spray the gelcoat into the mold, then they lay the
fiberglass and resin on top of the gelcoat. Then once you take the whole
shebang out of the mold, the gelcoats on the outside, with not a single
flaw. 

Have ya' thought about sanding it down smooth with like some 400 grit,
then working up to like 1200?  Then a bit of rubbing compound, and
finishing it up with either some Gel coat polish or just plain turtle
wax? Might wanna try that out on a small area somewhere and see what
happens. 

Cheers
Chris
