Hi,

I am new to this list, so the best place to start is by introducing myself.

My name is Richard, and I live in Coventry, England.  I have a 1969 T2 Devon
camper called Daffney.  She is currently having some welding done, so she
can be restored back to her former glory.  I need one panel to finish her
off, a NOS front panel is anyone knows of one!!!

I also have a beetle and a golf, but that is beside the point.

Cheers,

Richard
