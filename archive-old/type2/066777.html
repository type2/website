Subject: re:To use Thermostat or not?

In support of thermostats in really cold climates:

You'll never get any heat out of the beast, if there's not a thermostat.

After freezing halfway across Wyoming at -10 F., I wired my flaps closed to 
heat up the engine and my toes. I survived and decided to make the $20 
investment when I got home....
