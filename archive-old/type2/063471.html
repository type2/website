Subject: Early Bus Wiring Diagrams

Howdy,

Thanks to a yet-unamed party, my web site now sports early bus
wiring diagrams.

A couple of them are not really great scans, but most of them
are very nice.  The only problem is I do not yet know which
diagram is for which year!  D'oh!

Anyway, they are available at www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/techinfo.html

I know they only go back to '62; I'm still looking for earlier ones.
