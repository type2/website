Subject: wiring radio in 73
Message-ID: &lt;001301bebfe1$c12ab160$a6ab8318_at_USER.ce.mediaone_dot_net&gt;

My 73 Highroof finally runs like a top! Now after months of sweat i would
like to enjoy cruising to top 40. There is a radio in there though not
totally connected. All i know about audio is red is power, i hope. The red
line is going to an 8amp fuse. its a jensen and there are about 10 other
lines just hanging there. plus is doesnt turn on, i hvnt checked the inline
fuse yet though. any thoughts?
