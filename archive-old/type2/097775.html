Subject: Front Vent Chrome Ring

Hiya All One More Time,

Ever notice how the smallest typo can change the intent of the message.  From 
my first post in this thread and now with a slight addition.............

I cannot 
seem to get the front fresh air vent and its chrome trim ring to go easily 
into place.  The vent fits easily by itself.  And, when in place, there seems 
(eyeballing it) to be enough room around the edge for the trim ring.  But 
when the trim ring is fitted to the vent (and it's a good tight fit) it does 
not want to go in place without some force.  And I do NOT want to use force 
and 
wind up scratching the brand new paint.  Any ideas, tricks, tips out there?

Thanks for putting up with my idiocy.  I still would like to hear from anyone 
with advice (about the vent - not my typing!)

Mike
