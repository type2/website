From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; - (Whatzit?) &quot;SP 86250&quot;
&gt; - (Whatzit?) Japan, T-handled tool w/strange 1/2 round split end with
threaded shaft in center, t-handle and adjustment knob centered on other
end.

Okay, apparently these two are parts of the same tool.  The part with the SP
number on it is a &quot;red cross&quot; shape approximately 2.5&quot; across with rounded
corners.  It has a slot cut in the center of it that has rounds ends and a
larger round space in the middle of the slot that apparently accepts the
other part.

The t-handle part is approximately 5.5&quot; long x 5/8&quot; in diameter, with a
hollow round divided into 4 quarters (not 2, as I discovered that two of the
quarters are broken off) that expand slightly as you turn the t-handle on
the other end of the tool.

The hollow, quartered end of the one part seems to snap into the hole in the
center of the slot in the other part  When you turn the t-handle the hollow
end appears to tighten onto the other part (or would now if the two quarters
weren't broken off).

Any clues?
