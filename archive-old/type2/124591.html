Subject: EGR Parts for 81 Aircooled Vanagon

Hi Volks,

I am considering buying a 2000cc long block to replace the engine in my '81
Vanagon Westy.  Before starting out on the adventure of removing and
replacing the engine, I need to make sure I can get all the parts needed to
meet the NYS emission laws, which were recently changed to be the same as
Ca.  Otherwise, the beast will be headed for the scrap yard.  The van is
pretty much rust free (including the seams!), so I don't want to send it to
the junk yard if I can help it.

Missing from the current engine is almost all of the EGR system. (DPO didn't
think it was needed!  For that mater he left off the Cat and the
thermostat.)  All that is present of the EGR system is a &quot;J&quot; shaped pipe
connected to a small block of metal with a cute little lever on it, the
insides of which are plugged tight with carbon.  Not even the adjustable rod
that connects it to the throttle arm is present.

Can anybody point me to a place where I can find the part numbers for the
EGR system, or even a place that has the parts?

Thanks in advance,

Dave Kinerson
