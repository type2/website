It probably depends on the type of heater.  However, for an
Eberspacher, it has its own fuel pump (so you can run it with the
engine off).  However, you need to prime the pump first.  The easiest
way to do this is to have the fuel line connected to the tank, but
open at the heater end.  Let up on the clamp you've got on the line
until a little gas comes out.  Clamp down again, attached the line to
the heater, and remove the clamp.  Let it crank over for a little bit
to finish getting fuel to thecombustion chamber, and it should all be
good (assuming the heater and its pump work, of course).
