You may already know this but......   If you've got a ball/roller/needle
bearing that you need to replace, your VW dealer can be worst place to
start.  Take the old one to a bearing specialist such as Berry Bearings or
(21st century approach) check the Web.  In the latter case look for mfr# on
the bearing and/or have a buddy with micrometers give you the precise
dimensions.  You will save $$$ and aggravation.  Good luck!
