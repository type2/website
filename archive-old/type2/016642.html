&gt; The leak could be from the filler neck (which is rubber; can crack when you
&gt; jam in the pump nozzle- make sure to angle it down!) or from the connection
&gt; of pipe to gas tank.   Usually the former is a problem if you overfill (I
&gt; stop at first click) or from the latter (tends to leak when you make left
&gt; turns).  You can get at the pipe thru that round port in the wall where the
&gt; ECU is.  My lower connection was all cracked; I glopped silicone calk all
&gt; over it and then glopped silicone over a piece of flashing I then wrapped
&gt; over the connection and added large hose clamps.   No more smell on turns.

Another job for JB Weld, the stuff of legend.  I fixed the
filler-nec-to-tank connection with it about 10 years ago, still holding
fine.
