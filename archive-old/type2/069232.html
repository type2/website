I second the for nominating Rex as a straight-up guy.
I have not had any problems in my dealings with him. West Coasters will know
him as that &quot;dude&quot; at numerous shows that is always selling used shop
over-alls and work shirts that have beeen silk screened with VW logos etc.

BTW: He is the source for the canvas for the poptop section for my '67 Westy
project. It wasn't the NOS/OEM orange but was a very nice aftermarket re-pop
of the item in Khahi color similar to the late Vanagon westies. It works for
me! =)
