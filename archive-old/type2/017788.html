 CA listee's

Here is a link directly to the California Voluntary Accelerated Vehicle
Retirement Programs web page:
http://www.arb_dot_ca_dot_gov/msprog/avrp/avrp.htm

Had to search a bit to find it so thought I would save interested
parties the searching...

Also, I am most likely moving to the Monterey Bay area of California,
and having read some of the things on the list regarding CA, am
wondering if any list members are in the greater bay area, and if there
are any things I should be aware of before moving in regards to my '77
westy.  I found out from the state of CA site that I will have to pay a
$300 fee to bring my bus into to CA.  Does anyone have a link to or know
of where I can find out what the emissions tests consist of and what the
pass/fail standards are.  I just passed my Georgia state emissions test,
so I have the data from that to compare to California standards.

Lastly, if any list members know of any good resources for finding
houses to rent (long term) in the greater Monterey Bay-Carmel area I
would love some help there, I have not been able to find much of
anything on the web and am a bit panicked about finding housing, please
send info p-mail. Thanks,
Scoob
