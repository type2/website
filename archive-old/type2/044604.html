Subject: [T2] CAUTION Safety lesson learned the hard way!!

Hello fellow bussers,
I share this bit of stupidity on my part in hopes of helping others avoid
the same potentially dangerous situation. Here's what happened to me
tonight, I went to the gas station to fill up my 68 DC and also a 2 gallon
plastic gas can. While doing so a friend started talking to me as I was
finishing with the fill up.
  I live in the country and had an 18 mile drive to pick up my son. As I was
driving down the 2 lane twisty road I could smell gas so I stopped and
checked the gas can I'd bungeed in the bed of the DC. I thought maybe the
little vent had not been shut all the way but it was fine, so maybe I'd left
the cap off? I opened the gas door and the cap was there ( I didn't
physically touch the cap just looked). So I drove on and noticed that on
left hand turns the rear of the DC was a little &quot;mushy&quot; sort of like a low
tire, so I stop again and   thump all 4 tires, everything good but I still
smell gas? I drive on knowing I have a commitment to meet my son, and notice
the &quot;mushy&quot; left turn again. I figured maybe a bad suspension point or loose
wheel bearing so the next slow left hand turn I downshifted into 2nd gear at
about 25mph and at the apex of the turn gave it a little gas. ALL HELL BROKE
LOSE, the truck spun despite my turning into the skid, backing out of the
throttle, and braking. What was the cause? I found gasoline on the left rear
wheel well! I had put the gas cap on but only got it on one side of the
locking tabs, allowing fuel to literally pour out on left hand turns and
right onto my rear tire! Please take the time to make sure that your cap is
on tightly, it could save your life.
Very humbled,
Britt Grannis
