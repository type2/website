Subject: One small oil drip

I know this is a common problem. Is there a common set
of procedures to go through in hopes of stopping it?

Mine (motor oil) comes from somewhere just in front of
the center of the sump. It cunningly runs back and
smears the strainer cover nuts to confuse me.

Should I try tightening whatever bolts/nuts I find in
the area in hopes of stopping it?

It's a small drip that I've had since I got the bus.
Makes a stain on the driveway, but doesn't seem to
affect oil consumption between changes. And, while I
love my bus, I'm one of those &quot;the world's an
imperfect place, live with it,&quot; kind of mechanic.

So, I gotta ask: Is that little drip The First Sign of
The Engine Apocalypse--if i don't pull the engine and
put a new seal in?
