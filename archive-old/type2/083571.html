&gt; a couple of years ago a had an auto shop teacher who had a wrench that

&gt; hazy. it had a very thin profile which made it easy to get to the bushing.
&gt; there wasn't enough room in there to use a regular open-ended wrench.

&gt; ask around at FLAPS for this tool.  sorry to be so vague but hope that
&gt; helps,

Bill,

Joel is correct that the profile will have to be thin and if you can find
the wrench he describes, you may well be ahead of the game, but if you
can't or decide to go ahead with manufacturing  your own, the profile
thickness of the flats on the nut is 4mm.
