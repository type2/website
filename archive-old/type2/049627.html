Subject: Re: [T2] Camping for low $$$$$$:

There are several books available that list free campgrounds.  Some cover
certain regions and at least one I've seen covers the whole USA.

There are similar books that list &quot;almost free&quot; campgrounds regionally and
nationally.

Bear in mind that on National Forests one can do &quot;dispersed camping&quot; free.
The restrictions are minimal, primarily addressing pollution and fire
concerns.
