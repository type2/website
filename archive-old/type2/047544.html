Subject: Re: [T2] Bus won't start

&gt;&gt;Volks,
&gt;&gt;    I have done all of the suggested ignition checks and vacuum hose checks
&gt;&gt;I can think of.  The bus turns over and starts but will not idle.  I have
&gt;&gt;extensively read my Bentley and my Muir books as well as the library and I
&gt;&gt;am out of ideas so I turn to you.  My bus is fuel injected and I have
&gt;&gt;recently done a full tune up.  (not on the FI though)  I now turn to you
&gt;for
&gt;&gt;the answers.  Thank you much.
&gt;&gt;Dave

Check the air flow meter. Make sure the flap moves freely. Check the
contacts with the ohm setting on your VOM for the fuel pump circuit.
Bentley will have the pin outs. More than a few ohms here is a likely
culprit for your symptom.
