Subject: first busted clutch cable

Hello,

wow, your first busted clutch cable.

you attach the front fork end of the new clutch cable to the pedal hook
first, but there are many steps in the procedure.

You need to read the whole procedure in the Muir Idiot book.

After you have read the entire procedure you will understand my

extra suggestions and comments

wow, you sure are lucky that it happened in the nice warm summer and it is
not 20 below outside. my first one busted in the middle of the winter, it was
my only transportation, I had to get to work, I had to get to college, whine
whine whine

If you have a bus with the big wing nut at the transmission end of the cable
you are lucky. If you have the 11mm lock nut and the 14mm adjustment nut, buy
a special set of ratchet box end wrenches for adjusting and locking the
adjustment.

put a big glob of grease on the fork - pedal end of the cable. it will make
it last longer

Under the van at the front, Put that cover plate back on, it keeps you warmer
in the winter and protects the pedal assemblies from road debrie and rust
etc.

pull the torsion tube out of the transmission before you try to feed the new
cable. the long straight threaded cable end will not go through that curve,
then put the torsion tube, with the cable sticking out of it,  back on the
transmission.

really really grease up the new cable. put a huge golf ball chunk of grease
in your hand and run the cable through your hand when you feed the cable into
the cable housing tube.

before you put on the new cable, make sure your clutch pedal moves freely.
now is a good time to take it apart and grease up the axle of the pedal.

put anti-sieze lubricant on the adjustment end of the cable to make the
adjustment easier.

get a smart experienced buddy to test the clutch pedal freeplay while you lay
under the bus and adjust the freeplay. This will save you from having to
crawl out from under the bus a gazillion times to check the adjustment
yourself, then crawl under and adjust some more, then crawl out, then test
etc..

If your clutch cable ever busts again. You don't have to cram it into gear,
just turn off the engine, put the transmission in first gear (level ground)
or second gear (going downhill) , start the engine (not going uphill) and
drive off and then you can shift into the other higher gears even with a
broken clutch cable. You accelerate up to speed, then let the engine slow a
bit, pull the gear shift to nuetral, gently pull or push the lever into the
next higher gear without forcing and it will slip into the next gear.
Admittedly, this does take some skill. Do not grind the gears. If you can't
do it without grinding, then have the bus towed.
