Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump troubleshooting on 78 2.0 FI

&gt; I guess I'm not understanding the flow of electicity during starting to
&gt; the fuel pump. I'll hit the bentley again and see if I can figure out
&gt; what is supposed to be happening. I would have sworn the fuel pump
&gt; kicked on with the key in position 2, Run, prior to replacing the

Nope, it won't.  In modern cars, when you turn the car on the pump will
run for a few seconds to prime the fuel circuit and then turn off.  Then
when you crank, it turns it back on.  If the car detects a tach signal
(meaning the plugs are firing), it keeps the pump flowing.  This is also
how the megasquirt works (which is what I have on my bus).

&gt; transmission; but, it is entirely possible I'm confusing the Volvo's 
&gt; behavior with the bus -- my Volvo is D-Jet.

I'm not familiar with the djet so can't comment there...
