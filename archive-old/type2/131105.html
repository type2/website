Subject: Should I save these emails?

Is it ridiculous to think these emails might be being stored somewhere 
through Type2 - e.g. archives or the like - so that I don't have to store 
all this now, in case I need such info later?  I'm obviously not very savvy 
about the workings of cyberspace...but I don't want to delete things I might 
want to know about later!

Also, can anyone explain to me why I just got a failure notice saying I 
quoted too much, when I didn't quote anyone?  I'm sure I&quot;m misunderstanding 
the comment, but it's confusing...

thanks!
Marya
