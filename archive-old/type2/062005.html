&gt; Thanks, all, for the response on the long valve
&gt; problem.  Well, I got the head off, and the source
&gt; of the problem is a (currently) oversize valve seat
&gt; bore.  The valve seat insert RATTLES in there (it
&gt; is 40 mils over diameter, and 100 mills too deep).
&gt; The base of the bore is paper thin in spots, and in
&gt; places is pushed up into the intake manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; Please tell me that this is truly strange, that no
&gt; one has ever seen this before, that we'll probably
&gt; never see it again, and that I should send the head
&gt; to the Museum of the Truly Weird.
&gt; 
&gt; Or should I keep around a couple spare heads?

It's not all that weird, but I wouldn't go and buy extra heads just yet. 
On my '73, they messed up the head when putting in the seat (and peaned 
it over to make it &quot;stick&quot;. &quot;Oh, that's normal. Don't worry, we do LOTS 
of these heads, and they never fail.&quot;).  It failed in 8 thousand miles, 
during the move to my new house (of course). 

You can try having a local shop weld up the heads, then turn then down 
to the proper size (if they do LOTS of VWs... such as some of the hi-pro 
shops in CA). Personally, I'd find a good supplier and get a rebuilt 
head. Inspect it for obvious defects (like on mine), and return the old 
one for a core.
