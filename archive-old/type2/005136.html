I put a new axle on my 77 camper van, it wasnt new..it was from a junkyard.
Should I get a front end alignment?  what if that circlip thingy falls from
the brake booster rod...will i crash?.
also, sometimes my steering wheel will whirl around when i hit a bump just
right.
My van is quite a character but i think my 9 lives are running out.
eric
