Subject: FI hose fact check.

from another list...
does this seem right?


&quot;&quot;The
external braid hose we can buy now doesn't seem to be very good
quality and even if it was, it is the wrong size. It's all 7mm which
has too  stretch too much over the FI fittings, so it fails there
quickly. VW started with 7mm, but quickly changed to 7.5mm. In the
end, 8mm is an even better choice, and just happens to be equal to
5/16&quot;.

The best hose you can currently buy is just ordinary 5/16&quot; gas hose
from your local FLAPS. DON'T bother with the stuff they sell
specifically for FI, as that is made for much higher pressure FI
systems and costs 3x as much.&quot;&quot;
