Hello List People:

I have a problem that seems to have gotten progressively worse over the last 3-4 weeks.  I'd be driving along just fine, when my engine would suddenly stop running.  Most of the time, I could just let the bus run, and in effect, it would be like push starting, and the engine would start up again.  A couple weeks ago, this method no longer worked.  I'd have to pull over and re-start the engine, then it would be fine.  This would happen a few times a week, but yesterday, the engine died, and would not start.  It seemed the battery ran out of juice quickly, since I could only crank the starter for a little while, and the battery went completely dead.  I got towed home, and put a charger on the battery, and 4 hours later, it started and ran fine, but only ran about 15 minutes.  My wife came and we jump-started the bus, and was able to make it home.  This morning, the bus started great, but died on the commute to work.  This time, the battery was dead after about 5 seconds of cranking, and a jump start wouldn't get the engine started.  I got the bus towed to work, and measured the voltage across the battery.  It was only 10 volts, so I went and bought a new battery at lunch and installed it.  The new battery read 12.75 volts.  After I started the bus, I went and read the voltage across the battery again, and this time, with the engine running, the voltage was only 12.6 volts.  This has led me to deduce that the charging system voltage isn't high enough to charge the battery, and as a result, my old battery lost a cell.  Since the charging voltage is lower than the no-load battery voltage, does anyone know if it's my alternator or voltage regulator that's likely to be bad, or both??  Sorry for the long post, all replies will be appreciated.
