Subject: Sacramento: NEAT0 member needs help

Emmitt Goldsboro lives near Taneytown, MD. He is president of 
Mid-Atlantic Micros, the local NEATO affiliate. He does not have
access to e-mail :-(, but he does have a couple of nice splitties :-), 
and plans for a big family :-o!. 

He is looking for a 9 pax Vanagon to use as a family car. 
An '81 was posted on the Vanagon list today, in Sacramento; he has
already talked to the seller and needs some local help checking it out. 

If you can help him, having a look yourself or recommending someone else
(it has a blown clutch and cannot move), please call Emmitt at (410)
756-6134,
and you can make your suggestions and discuss options.

I am going on vacation shortly, so I can't help him follow through
on making appropriate connections. Emmitt is a dedicated enthusiast, and
you will enjoy talking with him. If you can help, please give him a
call. 


Thanks,

Tom F.
