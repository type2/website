Subject: Re: Rear Wheel cylinders - Do Type3 fit Type 1?? - Service!!

Thanks so much Ronnie! I really appreciate that! Those are the ones I have
on the front of my old drum spindles and they are original German, so will
just use them. I really appreciate that. That's service!!
You take care,
Courtney

&gt; Courtney, I just went out to the warehouse and checked the offset of the
&gt; wheel cylinders so as not to guide you the wrong way. I compared the 131
611
&gt; 057 and they have the same offset as your 113 611 053B so they will work
&gt; fine. The S B or type 3 have a shorter offset and will not work! even
though
&gt; they are a bigger diameter wheel cylinder.
&gt;
&gt; ronnie  old volks of az
&gt;
&gt; ps. The 131 are only available in German ATE or Indian TVS, I would use
the
&gt; ATE if I was you.
