Subject: Re: [T2] Getting my 78 Westy &quot;Smogged&quot; in Sacramento   Help needed.

Ben:

You're well on your way with the tune-up tools and book, though I'd forget
Muir and go for the Bentley manual specific to your vehicle.

(http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0837600944/qid=1028063551/sr=1-18/re
f=sr_1_18/104-9717172-6691954)

Do a comprehensive tune-up and get everything &quot;spot on.&quot;  Since it's &quot;new&quot;
to you I'd spring for new consumables (e.g., spark plugs, points, rotor,
etc.) just so you're sure everything's OK.

Make sure you do a complete inspection of all the air and vacuum hoses (some
disassembly required) and fix any leaks.  Again, since the car's new to you
I'd do a comprehensive vacuum leak test in addition to the inspection.

Do a complete inspection of the exhaust system and fix any leaks you find
there.

Change the oil and filter.  This is good advice for any recently-purchased
car but also can help you pass smog.

Since you probably don't have an O2 sensor you can't really check the
air/fuel setting yourself but you'll need to go to a shop with an exhaust
gas analyzer to have that done.  Make sure they insert the &quot;sniffer&quot; *in
front* of the catalytic converter instead of just ramming it up the tailpipe
like they'll most likely want to.

Take the car in for it's smog check with the engine *as hot* as possible.
Take a 20-30 minute high speed run on the freeway and then drive directly to
the smog station for inspection.

&gt; This Spring I bought my 78 Westy from a co-worker who had been not
&gt; using it for over a year.   I need to get this bus &quot;smogged&quot; under a
&gt; California Law, (it had been before until last year).   Can any list
&gt; members assist me in getting this engine ready for &quot;smogging&quot; and
&gt; helping me set it back afterwards or direct me to someone who cqan do
&gt; this wiithout costing me a month's pay?

&gt; PS, I do have Muir Book and tune up tools coming this week.
