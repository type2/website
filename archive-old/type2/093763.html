Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges - final 

I am getting ready to try and modify the VDO underdash rubber 3 gauge 
mount to fit in the radio hole.  Will be bringing out through the hole 
with my hands down the ashtray hole.  on  an 82 westy.  just waiting on 
a head temp gauge to get here from somewhere.

&gt;&gt; Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod 
&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt; mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided configuration
&gt;&gt; mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then
&gt;&gt; return the one I decide to not use.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What you think ??
&gt;
&gt; My bus has a pod mounted under the dash, to the right of the driver.
&gt; I have moved it forward and angled it up but it is still very difficult
&gt; to see. I am in the process of desigining an above the visor guage pod
&gt; which I hope will work out well for me -- I should be able to mount 6 
&gt; or 7
&gt; gauges there. If this were not possible I would move the gauges from 
&gt; below
&gt; the dash to on the dash to the left of the driver. Your mileage may 
&gt; vary,
&gt; but I really don't like them down below the dash. I don't want to have
&gt; to move my head to see the guages.
