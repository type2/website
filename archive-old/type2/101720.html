Honestly, that's not my bag, baby. :-)

&gt;Richard you mentioned the vacuum reading when up when you did your 
&gt;valve adjustment.  How are you adjusting them 1, 1.5 or 2 turns 
&gt;past contact?

The advice I chose was 1.5 times.  The book said more, many said less, so I split the difference like a few others did.  It's been quiet back there since the adjustment.

&gt;Also this article at Boston Bob's web site on adjusting Hydraulic 
&gt;Lifters to correct low vacuum problems is interesting...

I did the adjustment because I had replaced all the adjustment screws that were worn.  I think his advice about doing a leak down test would be more revealing.

There's a cameo of the Bentley in that last shot!
