Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

&gt; Thanks for all of the responses in regards to my oil leak. I went on the
&gt; trip regardless of the leak and had a great time. On the trip, I did
&gt; locate the leak. The leak is dripping from the crankcase seam at the
&gt; front where the bolt mates the case halves together. 

is this front of engine (like front of bus) at the flywheel side? if
so it sure coule be the main seal. If you meant the front of the
&quot;engine&quot; but back of the bus, then there is most likely no seal there.
It's open with only a sling washer in there to keep oil in. 

&gt; I did an archive
&gt; search and pulled up a couple of results of another who had a similar
&gt; problem. The consensus seemed to be that the main seal was blown and the
&gt; leak was just coming out at the seam. Does this make sense? If so, what
&gt; parts do I need to repair this?

if the main seal is gone. it's an easy, but a bit time consuming fix.
Requires the engine to be pulled, flywheel off. then just replace the
seal, check endplay and back in the engine goes.
