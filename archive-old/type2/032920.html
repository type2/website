Subject: Just being on this list costs money!

Here I am, minding my own business, when along comes a link to a link to
a link.

The link that I think I linked was http://www_dot_dekempensekeverclub_dot_com/
because of that link, in a wink I had bought a airline ticket to Europe
from San Francisco, just so I could visit the VW swap meet in Mol,
Belgium in February.

Maybe look around, buy a t-shirt, a snack. That sort of thing. I don't
even need anything for my bus.

This list is dangerous, I tell ya.
