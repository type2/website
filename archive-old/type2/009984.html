A question for the Brits:

I have seen pictures of Devon conversions that have a small cabinet in 
the rear corner. This is not a full-sized closet. It starts at the 
waistline of the bus and terminates at the headliner. About 4&quot;-6&quot; deep at 
its deepest point. Door hinged at the bottom. 

What was this cabinet designed to be used for?

TIA
