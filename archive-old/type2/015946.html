I'd agree with that statement.  My Mac has been rock solid for the last,
oh, eight years or so but after 12 years with my bus I am still learning
new things all the time, mostly from reading the manuals and this mailing
list.  Only today I learned which wire was for the alternator light from a
listmember - I never knew that before.  I guess I could also have gotten it
&gt;from Bentley if I had RTFM.  Trial and error would probably have netted me
a blown regulator or at the very least a waste of an hour or two of
precious bus-work-time.

A VW is definately not a Macintosh - it's more like a 1937 Olivetti
typewriter.
