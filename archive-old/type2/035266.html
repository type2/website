Subject: Hi-beam switch on '71-where do wires go?

Need to repost this question:  anyone know where the beam switching wire 
(inside the turn signal/dimmer switch housing) should be soldered? That 
wire, and one other, were broken off during recent trials/tribulations 
changing the ign. sw in our 71 SC. BD doesn't have the switch listed, and JC 
whipmee doesn't have one listed for that exact year. Plus I'm not sure I can 
afford a new one anyway. Ends up that it's stuck in high beam..so at least I 
CAN still spotlight the deer. And passing motorists. And the highway patrol.

Thanks, Marv Krupp....with his last e-mail change..yeah, right..
