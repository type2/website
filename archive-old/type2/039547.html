The best I will be able to offer any more of these kits for is $225.00, RMMW
price is 324.95, I'm sorry for this but the original 1 I offered had been in
stock for a year and we are cleaning out non moving items. I can offer this
new price due to a quanity discount i will recieve, who would have thought
that so many people would have wanted these. If still interested please call
and confirm.
