Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel lock

&gt; I want to pul;l my flywheel and change the rear main while I have the engine out.

&gt;   Is a flywheel lock a common item that maybe the flaps would carry or is it a specialty item that will have to be ordered,.  Any other suggestions on removing the flywheel?
&gt;   Thanks,

Better than a flywheel lock, just get a 4 or 5 foot length of 1-1/2 angle
or similar, drill two holes to match the cluth bolts (not opposite, just
skip one bolt), bolt it on, and have at it.  You won't have to stabilize
the engine and you won't risk breaking the case flange.
