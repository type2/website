Subject: gas tank removal on late (76) bus

Hello Type 2 List:

I just pulled the engine, got the firewall off
to clean my gas tank which I am suspicious of....

Well, all ok so far but I was stymied by the 13mm bolts
holding the metal bands that go over the tank--they are frozen
big time.  I was twisting them, heard some nasty sounds up above
and then finally realized I was twisting up the band itself!
I put a couple of turns in it before I stopped.

There doesnt seem to be any way to lock the tops of these bolts down.
I cannot seem to unfreeze them and am way too chicken to use a torch
in that area.  It seems hard to getliquid wrench on an upside down bolt.

I am tempted to just cut them and replace them with some metal webbing.
Is this a bad idea?  It might very well be a bad
idea as I have no concept at all
how they attach on the other side.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks!
