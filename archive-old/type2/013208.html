 Never add anything with TEFLON to your engine oil, it builds up 
 under  your rings and causes them to wear out very quickly. 

 You mean if I hadn't used TUFOIL for the last 15 years, I might go 
even further than the 223,000 mi the same engine has gone so far??  Most 
type 4 engines seem to need a rebuild after 140,000 mi. TUFOIL is a
PTFE-molybdemum additive made here in NJ., particles are too small to
build up.  My compression averages 140 still.
