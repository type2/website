Subject: more on dist from T2 tech library...

this supports what i was saying:

Oh yeah: the dual diaphragm distributor. It used manifold vacuum to retard
the spark so much that at an idle that the heads ran hot enough to burn
off the rich mixture required by all engines at that speed. As soon as you
crack the throttle, it springs back to the base setting and acts like a
single diaphragm unit. 

from:

So, in theory, one can set the dual vac to 5 ATDC with both hoses hooked
up, disconnect the retard hose, and run the distributor at that setting.
(i am learning here, any and all help/ideas appreciated.)

take care,

Steve
