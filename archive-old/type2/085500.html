Subject: Re: [T2] Digital oil temp g. and myriad mods of mine-Everybus..

Hi Mike,

I'll be showing my own answer to the Type II Quest for Space: The
Westrailer. A custom box trailer with an authentic 74 westy roof and turn
signals . 80 cubic feet of secured storage is always helpful on a campsite.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I have posted to the list about my $10 digital thermometer. Jeff Raven,
&gt; did you converse with me about this?  The one with the plug in wire on a
&gt; bent probe can indeed be straightened; I tried it.  The dual display
&gt; with the alarm is cute but larger than mine (about 1&quot; squ), which I
&gt; built in with the oil pressure gauge and a digital voltmeter (email me
&gt; for pic).
&gt; **For those going to Everybus; if my 234,000 mi engine makes it I will
&gt; be there to show this and the following to any interested party:
&gt; -enlarged glove box.
&gt; -triple bed from 74 put into 78 Westy. Speakers built into armrests,
&gt; along with separate radio/cd/cassette, vcr, TV, Sega Dreamcast....
&gt; -spare tire cover turned into a cabinet door flush with the storage
&gt; cabinet doors.
&gt; -shelf for tv added next to storage pod.
&gt; -flip up shelf on the sliding door interior.
&gt; -potty disguised as stool with padded cover.
&gt; -Opaque 2-sided curtains along with behind front seats curtain.
&gt; -Homemade spare tire cover and removable front bike rack.
&gt; -rear outside shelf for firewood or generator.
&gt; -Front cot turned into a solid bed with foam pad. (retired).
&gt; -Extra adult bed that runs along storage cabinet.
&gt; -Pod on outside rack for storing camping junk.
&gt; -ladder for above that hangs on side.
&gt; -outside awning from which a day tent can be hung or the stock Westy
&gt; tent.
&gt; -extra 12 v inputs, 50 amp converter to run all the 12v stuff on
&gt; housepower (and a 200watt inverter).
&gt; -more I'm sure I forgot!
