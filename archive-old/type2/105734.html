I guess that it helps to be able to read German...

Color me dull, but I couldn't get the cut-out pages to print completely, as
is.  All I could get were partial prints of what would fit on the paper.  I
finally saved the files to disk and re-converted them into JPG format, as
the original JPG format wouldn't open on my system, and printed them out
successfully on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper.

Of course, now my little buses are only 4&quot; long (9.6 cm).  Yowser! :O)
