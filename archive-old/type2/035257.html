Subject: z bed question

Ok list heres heres a question for you. My 74 Westy's Z bed's bottom which
is laminated has a bad case of the peels. Its cracked and hanging there
looking bad. So today i decided to peel and scrape away all the old
laminate. Now the question is I'm down to the last few pieces. How do i get
these off without gouging the wood underneath? The screw driver and paint
scrapper aren't cutting it anymore. Will heat work? Or is there a chemical
that will loosen the glue?
