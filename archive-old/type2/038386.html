GEX may also sell them.  They may be available rebuilt at your VW FLAPS.  
(they are in Portland, OR). 

The pertronix ignitor comes in two versions.  One for the dual advance 
dist.'s and one for the .009 dist.'s.  The unit will have the same positive 
effect on either dist.  It WON'T cure the hesitation problem and fuel economy 
associated with the .009.  These problems are a result of the advance curve 
of the .009 and a lack of vacuum advance on initial acceleration.  You get 
what you pay for ; )
