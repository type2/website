&gt; just wondering if anyone has some opinions on installing a distributor that

&gt; to me. small price to pay to protect your engine. but i'd like to hear from
&gt; the vw gurus on the list....

It's not a distributor, it is a rotor that fits in the distributor.  I
believe it has a set of contacts on a spring.  When the rotor spins too
fast, the contacts separate, and no spark.  I am not sure about whether
they fit the early year busses, but they were the stock rotor on the '76
and '78 busses that I own.  Since (by my eye) they are visuallly identical
to the 1600 rotor, they should fit any VW distributor.

I agree that they are a good idea, but because of how they work, they will
not protect against overspeed on a downhill.  If you let the bus drift up
over 80 on a steep slope and pop the clutch, you're gonna float the valves
:-(
