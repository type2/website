does anyone have any pics, etc. of what a type IV engine is &quot;supposed&quot; to
look like???   i'm not sure if there are parts missing from my '73.  also, i
had to buy a starter for it, and am not sure exactly how to install it.  i'm
assuming that i need a pulley and belt, but am not sure.  if anyone is in
the madison area and would like to volunteer some time to give me a hand
diagnosing problems with it, it would be greatly appreciated.  TIA.
