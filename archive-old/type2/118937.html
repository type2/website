Subject: Re: [T2] NIKE BUS

The contest 'Official Rules' on the website describe the bus because well,
its the prize. As for the questions Mojo jojo says you need to read up on
the Nike site that jo was created to hype....

oh and you need to have a drivers license and insurance to claim it, kiddies
need not apply.

&gt; That looks like a nice bus.
&gt; Does anyone know the year of that one?
&gt; PS how do you figure out the application form to
&gt; try and win?
