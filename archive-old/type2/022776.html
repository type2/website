&gt; Anyone have recommendations

Here are my recomendations

1. look in your owners manual or workshop manual as VW have a pretty definite 
suggestion about tyre size and rating.

2. look in the archives I guess 1 message in 20 will be about tyres and you 
can find out about brands and alternative size tyres that some use

3. Please think before posting, not everyone on the list has free use of the 
phone for internet calls. If you post questions which are regularly and  
copiously thrashed to death in the archives people will just think you are 
lazy and will be less likely to answer.
