Subject: re: FS '73 Westy Poptop, $5885

hey now,

first, let me say i didn't mean to come off insulting. maybe sacrastic but
not insulting.

secondly, when it comes to used vehicles in general, you are never going to
get back what you put into it. i have a '74 with a westy interior, new cv
joints, new tires, new brakes, new front end, rebuild engine, and solid body
but don't think i could get all the $2000 plus i've put into it. just don't
happen unless you find someone who doesn't know any better. that's just to
be expected from a 20+ year old vehicle.

unless of course it's a barndoor or older splittie. or a van like ric is
selling. he's put thousands of $$$'s in it, yet knows he can't sell it for
what'd he like to get for it.but considering the year of the van, i don't think
you'll get $5885. perhaps if the body was perfect, glass wasn't broken, all
acessories were working, canvas was in excellent shape.

again, i didn't mean to sound insulting. please accept my apologies if i
insulted you.

good luck selling your van.
