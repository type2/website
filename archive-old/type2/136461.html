Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of power inverters

&gt; I use a 750 watt (1,500 peak) inverter made by
&gt; Vector Manufacturing Ltd, 
&gt; Ft. Lauderdale, FL.
&gt; 
&gt; It delivers a (PWM) filtered modified sine wave
&gt; (several rectangular 
&gt; segments in each half of the wave.) That is a
&gt; mid-level cleaned up sort of 
&gt; AC power suitable for all but the most sensitive
&gt; power users.

But this pseudo-sine wave can cause overheating and
other problems, in your apppliance or motor,  that are
not immediately noticeable.

&gt; I chose the 750 watt because I can probably recharge
&gt; my battery at that 
&gt; rate with a 60 amp alternator making 13 volts..... 
&gt; 60 x 13 = 780 
&gt; watts.   AND I only need a maximum of about that
&gt; many watts to operate what 
&gt; I  want to use. I'll heat things with propane.

Remember, though that this inverter may be only 70% to
80% efficient, so that it could be drawing over
900watts from you  battery when putting out 750watts.
Something to keep in mind if running heavy loads for
many hours.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI, 
where the buses are tucked in the shed, avoiding the
18 below zero temps.
