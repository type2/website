Subject: Re: [T2] Checking elec. shorts, part II.

&gt;I took the advice of a couple fellow members and disconected the battery
&gt;ground strap and ran a wire lead from the battery - post and one from the
&gt;body of the van. I hooked the bulb out of my dome light inbetween the two
&gt;wires, and there was a short, small spark, but no light.. I measured the
&gt;battery, and it came up at 12 volts, so it should be fine.
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean that I don't have a short? Thanks for the help in advance.

The spark indicates some sort of load. Is there a stereo with a digital 
tuner or clock? Are all of the accessories disconnected and fuses removed?

The light bulb trick should only work if it is in series with the battery 
post and negative ground (or pos post and pos cable.)
