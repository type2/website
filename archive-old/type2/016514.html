Subject: What kind of car is that?

Hello,

As I was standing next to my '74 bus today, minding my own business, I was
approached by a young fellow whom I estimated to be approximately 18 years of
age. He was well dressed and spoke the King's English fluently.

He said to me, &quot;What kind of car is that?&quot;

I was at first amused, but then I thought we may well be the custodians of a
vanishing resource. I know there are not many type-2s in Chicago.

ttfn,
Bob
