Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus....HELP!

Hi Foustus,

I have a 1979 Westy that I cam a lot in during the summer, and I can offer 
some tips on a few of your questions.

First, I'd recommend a solar battery charger.  It's pretty cheap ($50-70), 
it's really easy to use (put it in the sun), and it keeps the battery pretty 
well charged.  I imagine Texas gets its share of sunshine, so I'd guess it 
would work as well as mine does here in Colorado.

Second, I run a Coleman Black Cat heater, and have found it to heat the 
interior of my Bus very well. Even in the spring and fall, the Utah desert 
can be chilly at night, and I've always stayed toasty warm.  Just BE SURE to 
crack one or both of your vent windows to give the heater a good supply of 
oxygen -- if you Bus is airtight, the heater will use more oxygen than you 
will, and there is danger of suffocation, especially while sleeping.

Good luck!
