&lt;&lt; I was changing my oil  - when unscreing the filter a small cup with a 
spring
 and ball droped out.  I can see where they go - just don't know what the
 order is -
 
     - ball, spring then cup(the cup has a hole in it)? &gt;&gt;

im not sure to what you are refering??...possibly the pressure fitting that 
you only can see when you take off the filter.....if that is the case i would 
opt to go to a salvage yard to pick up a used oil filter mount.  i cant come 
up with an explanation as to why that would pop out but it seems like it 
could be serious.  doesnt that ball/spring check valve have something to do 
with your oil press./or back flow from the filter??
