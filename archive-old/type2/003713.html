&gt; here's a question:
&gt;
&gt; so i'm adjusting my new brakes last night.  the bentley manual doesn't
&gt; describe which direction the stars need to turn.  my haynes manual says,
&gt; &quot;the star towards the front goes up, the back goes down.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; i found this to be false...on the driver's side.  this statement is true
on
&gt; the passenger side.
&gt;
&gt; so what's the deal..?  which way are they supposed to go?

All 4 are right hand thread. What you are doing is unscrewing them. Picture
a bolt in a fixed nut. You want the head of the bolt to be farther away from
the nut. Using the left front for an example, the bolt will point forward.
If it was out in the open and you could put a wrench on it, you would swing
the wrench down. But you can't use a wrench, so you need to use a brake
spoon or a screwdriver. Since you are using the backing plate as a pivot,
the direction you move the tool is opposite. To get the front-pointing on
the left and the rear-pointing on the right  to unscrew, you go up with the
tool.
On the rear-pointing one on the left and the front-pointing one on the
right, you go down.
Try to always picture a right hand threaded bolt and which way you need to
turn it to make it longer.
