&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I need new tires and wheels. The old wheels are in terrible,

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for tires, the optimum choice is 185R14, load range C or D.  Tire
&gt; 
&gt; there is a difference between &quot;optimum choice&quot; and &quot;original
equipment&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; the 185R14 is an older design and much narrower than some other tires
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 195-75R14s, but stick to your guns and have them order 185R14s for
&gt; 
&gt; there is nothing wrong with 195-75R14s not original but very
roadworthy.

I do not feel that the 195-75R14 is an optimum tire for buses for the
following reasons:

1. I have measured the rolling radius of a new 195-75R14 versus a new
185R14 and found that the 195- tire is about 4% smaller than the 185
tire.  This means that the engine will run faster at any given road
speed.

2. The load capacity of the 195-75R14 is actually less than the 185R14
for a give load range.  A 195-75R14 load range C tire actually has
less load capacity than a 185R14 standard load tire.  If you use the
195- tire you must use a load range D tire.

3. The wider tread of the 195- tire puts more stress on the steering
box when the wheels are turned with the bus stationary.  Steering
boxes are expensive to replace.  Contrary to the popular notion, wide
tires do not offer more traction than narrow tires except under
conditions where the tires are subject to frictional heating such as
in a sports car.  Buses are about as far from a sports car as you can
get!

There's nothing outdated about 185R14 tires.  This is still a common
size in Europe and Japan.  It isn't as popular in the US because the
US consumer goes for the stylish &quot;lower and wider&quot; tire.
