Kim,
  I am having the same type of thing on my 74. Have yet to
figure it out but if I do I will let you all know. I have
changed rotor and cap (pertronix no points)
and plug wires and coils and adjusted the valves twice.
still does it.
  I had the suggestion that it might be exhaust leak... so
I will check that out as soon as I get time.
  I cant hear it with the window up... only with the window
down and then only well if I am driving past something that
reflects the sound back at me..... who knows?!

the noises I heard this morning were not constant with the 
engine 
revolutions.  it was very uneven and spiratic.  There was 
no change when I 
gave it gas.

Any ideas or advice?

Kim in Portland
