. The engine is a rebuilt
2.0 in a westfalia . Running at cruising speed on a flat (or as flat as Utah
roads allow) _at_ 3400 rpm _at_ 60 mph I see the oil temperature at 220-230 and oil
pressure at 22 psi. How does this compare to your engines, the only
comparison I have is my old 71 camper that ran around 190 on the flat. Any
comments would be appreciated, I have double checked the timing and mixture
are set proper and am running 30w oil.

Clay, 

Your temps etc mirror my own under similar circumstances including ambient
temps in the 80's although you didn't mention that. IMHO you need to step up
your oil weight to single 40 or 20/50, depending upon your temp ranges, since
your pressure is too low. 30w doesn't handle 220*-230* and you're not getting
the oiling job done at pressure under 28.
