Subject: Re: [T2] Heater linkages

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; If your levers are the same as mine, the center lever (red) operates
&gt; the heater valves near the heat exchangers to admit or deny hot air to
&gt; the system. The left lever, red, determines whether air goes to the
&gt; defroster or footwells and rear area. The right lever opens up the
&gt; vents at the front grill to provide cool air ventilation or defrost
&gt; assist.

Thanks, John.

That probably means that I have a heat exchanger that isn't closing to the
system when I use the lever, and some misdirected air up front.

I can see the footwell cable, but the other is the broken one.  Do you know
what the left-most cable does when the it's in the fully open (the lever is
down) position?  I want the air up front and in the defrosters.  I don't
need to heat the rear area.

Thanks.
