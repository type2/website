Well, I am now the proud owner of a Orange 79 Camper.  Not really sure who
did the camper conversion.  The inside is mosty hideous.  At least the
carpet is.  There is a icebox &amp; hand operated sink behind the driver.  There
are RV style reading lamps all over.  There is a split seat in the back that
folds down into a bed.  There is a shelf above the back seats.  The mileage
is 48290.  The thing really runs sweet.  I will post pictures on my web site
as soon as possible.  We will probably sell the other 79 fairly quickly.  I
do not need 3 buses.  On the other hand...
