Hi Sean,

I don't know too many people that have been happy with Hayman's service*,
and that goes back a LLLOOONNNGG time in my family. His main claim to fame
was that he had a shop just north of town with at least 50 bugs clustered in
the field around it. That often drew people in, but it wasn't usually enough
to keep them coming back.

Still, it is hard around here to find someone willing to work on 30 year old
gasoline-fueled furnaces in the current &quot;Sue-first-and-ask-questions-later&quot;
consumer environment. Really great engine mechanics often just can't be
bothered to get involved with them. Networking on the list and with local
clubs and swap meets and working the archives pays off with stuff like this.

If you compare the repair cost with what Espar is asking for a new one, I'm
sure *they* think you're getting a great deal. Hope you get all the pieces
back.

The above represents my personal $0.02  Cdn$. YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just purchased a plug from Ark last week  ( have yet to receive it).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks like he knows what he's doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever you do, don't deal w/ Gordon Hayman of Hayman Motors in Canada.
&gt; He's listed on the Espar page as a recommended dealer, but I just got off
&gt; the phone w/ him and he tried to charge me $170 US (before tax and whatever
&gt; it would cost to send back to me) to fix what was apparently a simple wiring
&gt; problem. When I told him that seemed high, he hung up, saying he would send
&gt; &quot;put the heater back the way it was&quot; and send it back to me. We'll see comes
&gt; back.
