Subject: Re: Home built Gas Analyzer. Any updates?

I have seen an article on this in a bike mag (Roadracing World and
Motorcycle Technology) and even set one up to use on my Ducati. Basically
all you do is hook a volt meter and a 12v power supply up to the sensor
(that is, after you have the sensor boss welded to an appropriate section
of the pipe). As for what the output should be, well, I'll have to look for
the article again.

&gt;From memory I'd say that 1.0v meant the mixture was good, either side of
that meant rich or lean with the values changing quickly as you strayed
from the &quot;right&quot; mix. It didn't work on my Ducati, likely due to the sensor
being too close to the outlet. (I ended up using the tried and true &quot;seat
of the pants&quot; method to trim the injection)

I'll look for the article, but I recently moved so it might be a while
before it turns up. I should also have a few sensors lying around here
somewhere...

Bottom line is it's a simple set-up requiring little in the way of
instrumentation savy. Now where did I put those magazines?

&gt;knows how to use an aftermarket O2 sensor to create one? It would seem
&gt;that a digital meter and an O2 sensor suitably powered could be calibrated
&gt;to give you a decent idea of fuel air mix. Am I out to lunch with this
&gt;idea?
