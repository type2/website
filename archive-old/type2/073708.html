Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera sliding window

[...]

&gt; My 72 Rivi is missing the passenger side sliding window.  I went to the
&gt; glass shop and they told me it's NLA und would have to be reproduced in
&gt; plastic unless I could track down the manufacturer.
&gt; 
&gt; So, first, does anyone happen to have one, or even the little clasp?  And
&gt; second, does anyone know who manufactured the window frames?  I've examined
&gt; mine and find no maker's mark.  Maybe I'll have to scrounge a set of
&gt; jalousies. :(
 
Did Riviera make their own windows??  
Or did someone install 78/79 sliding windows? 
Is there ANY markings on the glass?
