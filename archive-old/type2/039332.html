Subject: Coil questions...

All,

In case you didn't catch my earlier post ('69
carb/coil problems); I'm having a coil problem that I
need info on. 

I noticed a clear, odorless liduid leaking in rather
copious amounts from my coil tonight. I realize it's
shot, but I still have a few questions:

1-Why did it die? It's a Bosch blue coil that is less
than 2 years old.

2-What typically causes a coil to fail? 

3-Should I be looking for some other problem before
replacing this one?

4-Aren't Bosch coils supposed to last longer than
this??? The old black one lasted *many* times longer
than the supposedly *superior* Bosch.

5-The Bosch blue coils are apparently NLA (not that
I'd necessarily buy another one, anyway), and have
been replaced by the Mexi-Brazillian ones. I'm not too
fond of the other Mexi-Brazillian parts I've tried
(muy caca quality, so to speak). Any other suggestions
(I'm on a budget, so be gentle;-)???

TIA!
