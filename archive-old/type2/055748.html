Subject: Re: 78 westy owner's manual / towing advice

&gt; 
&gt; Note that the manual is for a bus, not for a westy -- or did I miss 
&gt; the information about the westfalia equipment?  Wasn't that part 
&gt; covered in an extra manual?

Good call Joe, I guess I responded too quickly! :-)
Yes, there is a separate Westy manual for the camper equipment, which I
didn't have because I didn't have a Westy.

&gt; BTW towing thread followers -- take note of what it says about 
&gt; towing on page 65:

&gt; PS Senor Bartnik, thanks for scanning that manual!

Yessir, my pleasure!  One day in the future:  '81 Vanagon owner's manual
and '81 Westy camper supplement.
