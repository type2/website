You should be able to blow easily through the heat riser.

If you can, this would be a good time for the &quot;speedo cable in the drill&quot;
cleaning trick.  This doesn't work so well on a completely blocked riser,
but it is a good way to clean out a tube that is just a bit dirty with
carbon deposits.
