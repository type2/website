Subject: Muffler fresh-air collars

thanks george for the tip on the copper muffler nuts.
gottem on and sheet metal back in. Whew.

Final problem is that I can't get the two collars
(bentley calls them &quot;fresh-air pipes&quot;) into the rear
fist-sized heat exchangers. You know, for the fresh
air hoses that come out of the dog house. I didn't get
a new pair with the muffler, so i pulled the ones out
of the old muffler. 

The fit is so, so tight...is there a trick?

 I tried running the engine to heat the muffler and
expand the holes--but the heat conducts into the
collars so fast I can barely handle them. Tomorrow,
i'm going to put the collars in the freezer then warm
up the engine, maybe that will help--along with some
careful hammer tapping.

If that fails-- it's on to a bigger hammer and a piece
of 2x4.

Any help appreciated.
