Hi,
    I have a 78 transporter. Smile, warm fuzzy feeling enters stage left.
Last week while driving on a short trip, read 40 miles of two lane highway,
my oil light began to flicker and power began to *disappear*.  I pulled over
to check my oil, cool down, and have a coke when I discovered that my oil
wasn't lower than when I started my journey but higher!!!!  Hmmm. The oil,
in my opinion, had gas mixed in somehow.  I nursed the bus home and drained
the oil.  So, with new oil and filter, I tried the drive again
yesterday......  Same thing happens, power loss, oil light begins to
flicker.  Are my rings shot?? Should I plan on new jugs and plugs?  Would
gasoline thinned oil cause damage to the 78 heads?  My baby is staying
parked until I can get this little thing fixed.  But we should be in prime
condition for the drive down to Eureka Springs, Ark in August. TIA
