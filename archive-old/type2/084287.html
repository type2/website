If your not up to drilling your sump plate check out Bus Boys. Got mine from them

&gt; &gt; I have a new VDO oil temp sensor that I want to install in my 78 Westy.
&gt; &gt; In the directions it says to drill a hole in the oil pan that is under the
&gt; &gt; screen.  Is this the right place? I thought I had seen one in the other
&gt; &gt; pan below the dipstick. Can somebody who has installed this let me
&gt; &gt; know what you did.
&gt;
&gt; have mine in the &quot;other&quot; pan, but drill carefully it will only fit in the
&gt; exact right spot.
