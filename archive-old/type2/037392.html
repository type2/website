OK, so my Westy eats up 1/2 quart of oil every 400 miles.

If I go through 3 1/2 quarts every 2800 miles, does this mean I don't have 
to change my oil at 3000 miles??

Or, should I wait until I am 2 1/2 quarts down, and change it at the 
recommended 2000 interval??

(It's a rainy, miserable day outside, and things are a little difficult 
right now...)
