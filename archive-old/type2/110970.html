Subject: RE: [T2] 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

ok thanks all i will go home tonight and try to make sure she is set in time and then laterz tomorrow night i will take a quick peak at the pushrods and that way if needed be then i can adjust them///
...

thanks for the info...
so when i get the pushrods out then i can try to see if a magnet sticks to them or not ?
and when and if the magnet does stick this means that they are hydraulic lifters...?
ok cool thanks..................

&gt;i think folks are saying that the _pushrods_ for
&gt;hyd. lifters are supposed to be magnetic, not the
&gt;pushrod _tubes_.
&gt;
&gt;&amp; of course, as someone else has already mentioned,
&gt;a PO could have swapped them out.
&gt;
&gt;i think the only way is to go in &amp; verify for
&gt;yourself.
&gt;
&gt;good luck,
