Hey everyone,
I have a '72 westy and the body is pretty solid except for under the
windshield (wierd place huh) anyway, I was wondering if you think I should
just patch it up with some body work and some bondo, or if I really should go
the extra distance and $ and have a new piece welded on.

Also, question to other westfalia camper owners....does the insulation that
the campers have help retain the heat much? or is it pretty unnoticeable?

Thanks,
Shawn
