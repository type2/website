Subject: Re: [T2] Front (anti) sway bar clamps

I'd contact the vendor about those clamps...The stock swaybar clamp
is a shorter in diameter at the front than at the back; it's also roughly
&quot;D&quot; shaped... The picture above doesn't &quot;seem&quot; to be the same...It
looks like a plumbing part (I could be wrong...) that's used as a clamp
over a repair patch on hard-to-reach/remove pipes...Any &quot;real&quot;
plumbers wanna verify that...Like I said I'm just goin' by the picture... ;-(
