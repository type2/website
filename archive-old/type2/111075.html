&gt; &lt;&lt; For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it
&gt; as a &quot;new car&quot;....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with
&gt; metallic paint though. &gt;&gt;

&gt; OK, but the problem is that it's registered as a 19... Beetle. Is $11,500
&gt; the insurable price even as a completely restored 19... Beetle? After
&gt; all, you can't tell the insurance company what it really is, they take
&gt; a dim view of insuring a technically illegal vehicle...

It's not illegal at all.  It's a completely restored 19xx beetle.
Truckers have been doing the same thing for years, putting &quot;floater kits&quot;
(the entire truck except the frame) on 30-year-old frame rails to
avoid taxes.

Now, getting the insurance company to acknowledge its worth might be a
problem.  Perhaps it would be better to just drive defensively?
