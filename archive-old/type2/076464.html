Subject: Riviera stuff

well my latest purchase from e-hell arrived yesterday,this time tho its
actually worth the money in that it's the parts catalog for various years
Riviera's. Looking thru it raised a couple of questions, those of you that
have the stove mounted on the jumpseat, does the stove store inside the
jumpseat? And where is the connection for the propane, is it inside the bus
or does it hook up outside?
My also has a grey water tank mounted on the drivers side, yet that part
doesn't show in any year and I've got the correct year catalog. The only
time grey water is addressed is in a note about the state of Oregon
clarifying laws about grey water basically saying tho shall not dump and
Riviera shows a recommended procedure basically using a 5gal tank to drain
the sink and dispose of it. I've got the years 79,78,77&amp;73 so if you were
wondering if it belonged I can probably tell you.
Thanks all
