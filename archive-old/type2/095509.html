Subject: RE: [T2] Things for Kids in Jerome?

  There are always kids events planned for both saturday and sunday. Crafts
and games in a seperate area out of way of other activities. I take my son
(9) now every year and he wouldn't miss it. Just bring whatever it takes to
keep them (and yourself) clean as there are NO FACILITIES there except out
houses and 1 water spiget, there are always ton's of kids there also for
yours to play with. Ask somebody when you get there where to camp to avoid
the rubber johnneys that may keep your kids awake in the evening.
  A very well planned and maintained event that is a MUST DO, I wouldn't
miss it.

Subject: [T2] Things for Kids in Jerome?


As I prepare to go to my first Jerome visit, I am wondering if there are
things for children to do there.  I have three daughters and a son ages
7,5,3, and 1.  My wife has graciously agreed that if there isn't really
anything kid friendly to do there that I can go alone.

I appreciate any public or private replies.

Thanks,
