Sorry about that...
To continue- The advertising corp. resprayed your VW silver and loaded it 
with decals
for Kool Cigarettes. After a year, the deal included removal of the decals, 
and you
could take some cash and leave the car silver, or they would spray it back 
the original
color. At the time, I think the payment was about $50 a month for the use of 
your car.
