Subject: How wide? '67

&gt; Subject: How wide? '67

&gt; Anyone with a '67 and a tape measure out there? I need to know
&gt; how wide one is at the widest point...at the bumper or
&gt; otherwise...or both.

&gt; Thanks! Joe

The Bus Boys &quot;Blueprint&quot; poster specs the width of a '62 Deluxe
at 1800 cm, measuring out-to-out on the rear bumper.  That
translates to 70.8&quot; I went home at lunch, measured my '67 Deluxe
at 71&quot; (5'-11&quot;) out-to-out at the same location.  It's 73&quot;
(6'-1&quot;) measured to the outside of the (round) mirrors.
