Improperly stored glass will sag over time. I know that seems strange for
something that rigid. You can almost never go wrong by storing it upright.
But it wouldn't hurt to put something soft under the bottom edge or build
a support like the glass shops use. I made one out of PVC but if you do
that make sure to use thick walled PVC because the weight of the
windshield will try to bend it over time. Another pretty failsafe way to
store your glass would be to lay down some old pillows and lay the glass
on it with the inside of the glass against the pillows. If you do that
don't try to support the ends, just let them hang off the edge of the
pillows.
