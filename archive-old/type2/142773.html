Subject: ...It gives you wings! (Carbs finally adjusted!)

Yay!!! Carbs are running sweeeeet and the bus flies now!

It was a suggestion from a list member that helped me nail it.

Summary of steps I finally took to get a balance:
1. Turn volume control screws out 2 1/2 turns.
2. Disconnect crossbar linkage from both carbs.
3. Back out the stop plate screws, then turn 1 1/2 turns after contact.
4. Reconnect and adjust crossbar linkage (IMPORTANT!)
5. Set central idle mixture and speed screws to 3 turns out.
6. Start and warm up bus.
7. Disconnect crossbar linkage from both carbs
8. Use Unisyn to verify balance (it was darn close without doing
anything), use volume screws to nail.
9. Pull solenoid wires on each to verify they both drop the same. Note
that you will need to turn the idle up to 1200 rpms to keep from
stalling while doing this.
10. Reconnect crossbar linkage to both carbs, verifying the throttle
positions do not change (readjust as necessary).
11. Adjust idle mixture and speed per Bentley.
12. Use dashpot to set throttle to 2000 rpms.
13. Use unisyn to verify balance. (Mine was spot on.)
14. Turn dashpot back down.
15. DRIVE!!!!!

Everything except the stop plate screw setting and the throttle
opening balance check I found in the Bentley. Problem is that the
information is scattered all over the place. Grrr...

It was nice to verify that the throttle plates were opening the same
amount at speed too.
