Subject: Re: Pop-Top Question;67

 Did the early  square, small &quot;euro style&quot; pop tops use the 
factory sunroof hole?
- - - - -
no, they didn't.   The dormobiles, did.  Those are the big tops that open up
sideways.

 Secondary question: what does the little switch on the bottom, left side 
of the speedometer binnacle do?
- - - - -
that lets the rear interior light(s) be turned on.  They also have their own
switches on each light.  One  rear light for non westys- 3 for westys
