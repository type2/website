Subject: Re: [T2] Three oil changes

I figure its just a waiting game to see how this engine behaves after
having its teeth brushed.
The new owner has plans to drive it around town and do a little 100 mile
radius camping so until Texas hits that 90/100 degree Summer days I think
it will fare OK.
I couldn't even speculate about future engine life. ( I chose 10/30 oil
for the last change because I wanted to see if the oil pressure dropped
into the idiot light zone at operating temps)
It will pass Texas inspection if it has all of the OEM EGR equipment
since vehicles over 20 years are exempt from tail pipe suckers.
I really don't mind helping other VW owners out but I'm not in a
situation to start pulling engines and rebuilding them so I'm just
wishing her the best of luck because any job that leaves the vehicle
disabled just can't happen in my driveway.
(I've stressed the neighbors enough with the three engines I pulled last
year on my own project Westies).

---------------- Snip ------------------
Something that happens as well is this buildup gets
backed to hard carbon inside the underneith of the pistons and begins to
break off in chunks of various sizes. This causes piston weight imbalance
and the bigger particles will clog the pickup screen and the smaller ones
will go to the oil pump for grinding into carbon sand thence on to the
filter to clog it very fast then bypass on to the bearings and cam lobes
for custom machine work in-situ.
