&gt; Has anyone had problems with Brazilian (yes, I know) VW C/V Boots lately????
&gt; I'm on my 2nd set in two weeks and one f'd up again today!
&gt; 
&gt; They are coming apart from the flange-- is this common?  I'm getting tired
&gt; of cleaning up joint grease throw up.

I haven't had good luck with the brazilian or even current production
German boots.  I have had good luck with Rockford made in USA boots.  the
only caution I have with these is that you have to put the axle end of the
boot nearer the CV than it would be if you put it between the raised rings
on the axle.  I just put it outboard of the outboard ring and it works
fine.
