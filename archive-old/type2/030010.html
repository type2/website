Low profile??  Where?  75 series tire is no where near being low
profile...a 185R14 and a 195/75R14 are, by the numbers, within a half inch
overall height difference, if memory serves.

Hell, the 195/60HR14's on the quantum arent exactly low profile either..


Maybe its a case of way to much dry pavement sliding on 155 and 165's in
my past, for no good reason other then there not being enough contact area
on the tires...I /dont/ drive easy.

Mom can (and does..) run around all day on 165/80R13's with her Jetta...I
drive the car and wonder when the roads got greasy..
