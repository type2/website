Subject: John Brown's Buses 2003 Trip report (long)

Hi Volks,

We're home, the bus is (mostly) unloaded, and the digital camera images 
are already online.

http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/VW_type2/JBB2003

Here's the long version:

We left on Thursday night, in order to break up the drive and to 
minimize the overnight exposure to Pennsylvania white-tail. The weather 
in Toronto was fine, a marked improvement from the 55mph winds we had 
here last Wednesday. The kids rode quietly, watching the DVD's we 
rented before we left on the PS/2 mounted under the new TV set I bought 
last week at Walmart. The 13&quot; TV only draws 53 watts, so it *and* the 
PS/2 can be run off a 400 watt inverter. The kids travel for hours now 
before they resort to beating on one another. We caught up with my 
parents at Evangola State Park in New York at about 11PM, and set the 
bus up and tucked the kids in before catching the last inning of Boston 
vs NewYork with my parents.

Friday we awoke about 8AM and I took the kids out to have a look at the 
&quot;other&quot; side of Lake Erie. We've seen Erie from the Canadian shore, but 
never looked back at Canada from the other side. The shoreline there is 
shale, and the waterline isn't visible due to the overhang of the 25' 
cliff face you stand on. Thank goodness they put up a chain-link fence, 
as if you went over the edge  you'd never get back up. You'd have to 
walk or swim at least a mile to get to a proper beach.

Back in the bus we refuel ASAP to synchronize our fuel tanks, and get 
rolling on I90 at 9:40, running 20 minutes ahead of  schedule. With 
luck we should make it to Harpers Ferry in about 7 hours, that puts us 
there by 5PM. The weather is clear and bright, with the vanagon's 
interior thermometer at 22 degrees Centigrade and 16 degrees outside. 
Perfect weather for a road trip.

Like being ahead of schedule, it doesn't last.

Just south of Erie PA, something changed. A dark cloud swept over the 
horizon, and a deep chill set in. 12:30 PM found us just north of 
Pittsburgh, at the same rest stop we had used on our trip to EveryBus 
2003. Now the temperature is down to 11 degrees, and the wind is 
bitter. We pop the westrailer open and make some sandwiches, make use 
of the well-kept facilities, shuffle a different offspring into the 
grandparent's bus, and get back on the road.

After we turn left onto I70/76, the rain starts. Small droplets quickly 
build on the windshield, but the thick layer of Rain-X quickly diverts 
the water away. I drive for miles without switching on the wipers, 
preferring the slow beading up of water to the blurry sweep of the 
wiper arms. The next fuel stop we swap drivers, and Colleen takes the 
helm.  She isn't quite as comfortable with the Zen approach of Rain-X, 
and the swish-swish beat of the wipers can soon be heard over the drone 
of the Continental RT-735's on the concrete. I droop into an uneasy 
sleep, but awake as the note of the drone changes: the highway shoulder 
has been replaced with an abrupt solid concrete wall for the next 25 
miles, and the exhaust and tire noise of the bus are loudly reflected 
back at us. The situation gets worse as the drivers side wiper loosens 
up and gets out of sync with the other, Colleen switches the wipers off 
and resorts to occasionally blipping them to clear the view. Without 
Rain-X this would have been suicidal under these conditions, but we 
soldier on until the other side of the Allegheny tunnel, and when we 
pull off at Cumberland for fuel I break out the toolbox and tighten the 
wiper. Since I managed a little rest on this past leg of the trip, I 
get back in the drivers seat after refueling and we head out once again.

The rest of the trip wasn't all that noteworthy. The anticipation 
builds as we get closer to Harpers Ferry, but forces of evil conspire 
to thwart our desires at every turn. Or something like that. Maybe it 
was just the Washington D.C. traffic flowing back into West Virginia on 
a Friday night. All I know is that it didn't seem fair for the last 8 
miles of the trip to take 45 minutes.

Anyway, we eventually made it to the campground, and found our campsite 
in roughly the same spot as we had last year. Jamie was there setting 
up his westy tent, and Christina arrived soon after. Hugs abounded, and 
I set about erecting &quot;The Blue Sky&quot;, site of so many bus-related good 
times. We strung lots of christmas lights on it, which gave plenty of 
light to those underneath. A couple of libations may have been consumed 
in the hours that followed, along with an excellent taco dinner 
prepared by Jamie and Christina.

Saturday morning I awoke the other Canadians and set into getting the 
pancakes happening. Christina Auch helped with the Bacon, and soon we 
had flapjacks happening all over. Along with fresh maple syrup and 
coffee brewed in Jamie's nifty Coleman drip percolator we had all the 
breakfast we could need.

After breakfast everyone chilled out and basically milled around 
showing each other the cool things we'd done to our buses or swapping 
stories about where we'd taken them. I got a chance to show off the DVD 
I made of my VW picture collection, which is now organized by year and 
outing and the slideshows can be navigated with a standard DVD remote. 
It works nicely in the kids PS2, and is easier to see on the TV set 
than on a laptop screen. Steve Dolan and Access Bob arrived, as did 
Mark Dearing. I was surprised to notice that I've now been to Everybus 
and John Brown's so many times I no longer need an interpreter for 
Mark's Virginian accent. It was so embarrassing before, having to get 
him to repeat things for me all the time.

When dinner time came, everyone seemed to want to feed everyone else. 
Ronnie had some great barbecue, and Ian was sharing his veggie chili 
that did so well in competition at Everybus. Jamie and Christina made a 
spaghetti, and my parents had brought a meatloaf and my Mom's exquisite 
fruit cocktail cake. It wasn't a formal pot-luck, it just sort of 
worked out that way. I'm certain that no-one went hungry, that is for 
sure.

After dinner we started a campfire *under* the blue sky. We kept it low 
and managed not to scar the tarp, and the smoke wasn't near as much a 
problem as I thought it would be. Jamie started bringing out the door 
prizes, and not long after that my Dad and I set out to round everyone 
up for the presentations.

Jamie did a great job of the door prizes and awards. He started with 
the littlest one's, and moved up through the ages until every child at 
the event had a toy. Then he presented the awards: Youngest camper, 
oldest bus, and longest distance travelled. Since my parents had 
visited their doctor before heading to Harpers Ferry, they felt *they* 
should get the longest distance, although my house is further. Jamie  
compromised by splitting the prize: I got an awesome tie-dyed 
&quot;Buskatiers&quot; T-Shirt and my parents got the &quot;winged bus&quot; trophy.

A few more libations passed my way after the campfire, and I pulled the 
plug on the canopy lights of the blue sky and went to bed some time 
around 11:30PM.

Sunday morning arrived bright and shiny, and almost warm. Once the sun 
rose a few degrees, it actually did warm up. Soon the Blue Sky was a 
flurry of activity as the Burrito Breakfast got under way. People were 
chopping this and stirring that and frying something else all over the 
place. Meanwhile I was busy packing up the bus and getting ready for 
the long haul non-stop flight home. I stopped packing long enough to 
scarf down a couple of delicious burritos, then drafted a couple of 
volunteers to help me drop and pack the Blue Sky. After the poles were 
loaded into the custom rack bolted into the jack points of the bus I 
wheeled the bus into the group picture lineup: someone had noticed that 
we had all of the colors of the rainbow represented in buses. We found 
a scenic spot to line them up and soon everyone was snapping pics of 
them. The last pic was the group shot: I set up a tiny tripod on a 
picnic table and used the 10 second self-timer to run and get into the 
picture with everyone else. I got cute and posed reclining... someone 
had to!

More cleaning and packing followed up until 11:30, when we found 
ourselves with nothing else to do except the hard part... saying 
goodbye. &quot;See you at EveryBus&quot; was a common refrain as buses departed, 
and lots of hugs and handshakes all around. We pulled out of camp a 
minute ahead of schedule, at 11:59AM

The drive home was uneventful, but long. Three gas stops, two meal 
stops and eleven point three hours later I backed the bus up the 
driveway.  No snowstorm on I90, no hassles at customs. The only fly in 
the ointment was a flickering oil light at low idle that appeared at 
the first I90 toll booth, and persisted the rest of the trip. I checked 
the oil but it was not low. A little throttle would quickly extinguish 
the light. I'll have to have a closer look at this before we go too far 
with the bus, as we did an oil change before we left and had no trouble 
on the trip down.

  Anyway, we had a great time and I want to thank Jamie and Christina 
Auch and all the VWonderful friends that shared the event with us.


Happy trails,
