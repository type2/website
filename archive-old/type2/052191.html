Subject: Re: [T2] Barrel nuts for front tire mounting, anyone figure it out?

I took a small length of steel tube (thick wall) and tapped it on both ends 
and then screwed in at one end a short piece of all thread and used regular 
lug nuts.

Use whatever lengths get the job done.

This allows me to turn the wheel around so that the hubcaps will fit.

I think if the tire doesn't sit on the bumper that you may experience some 
deformation of the nose (the weight is at the end of the lengthened studs 
instead of right against the nose with the wheel facing the body work).

&gt;hi everybody!
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if anyone ever figured out what to
&gt;look for in barrel nuts to mount the spare tire on the front
&gt;backwards so that the hupcap could be mounted to cover up the ends.
&gt;I really like the way that looks, and was wondering after we discussed it 
&gt;the last time around if anyone got it figured out or not.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
