 Now that my bus is up and running again, I'm trying to put the trailer
hitch on (don't worry, I'm hauling very light boats)  Problem is, the PO
has some sort of &quot;high performance&quot; exhaust system installed, the trailer
hitch won't fit, and there aren't very many busses around to go see what
it's supposed to look like.  So: (it's a 73 with a 74 engine)

The Bentley manual shows the muffler connected directly to the heat
exchangers, which have two horizontal holes, each.

My heat exchangers have two vertical holes apiece.  Bolted to them are
plates connected to two pipes which run to the muffler.  The pass. side
pipes cross all the way across to the drivers side.

Did he put on some sort of new fangled high tech heat exchangers?  Or did
they change at some year?  The RMM catalogue shows a muffler that looks
just like the one in the Bentley catalogue.  If these are stock heat
exchangers, how do they connect to the muffler?  RMM catalogue has no parts
listed for that.

Thanks for any help.  I'm trying to get the hitch on in time for this
weekend so that I won't miss any more of the season!  (Yes, we race our
dinghys in the winter up here.  Don't ask why.)

Jeff
