Subject: Re: [T2] Door Buzzer - fused??

Hey, Doug . . .

I used my buzzer box to form the base to attach a Radio Shack Ding-Dong 
chime.

I pulled the buzzer box off the fuse block, then I pulled the silver cap off 
the base, and gutted the insides.  I kept the prongs on the base.  (I needed 
the base to have the physical connection to the fuse box)


Then I punched a hole thru the bottom of the silver cap, wired the Radio 
Shack ding-dong thru the hole to the remaining prongs on the base, and 
attached silver cap back to its base and then attached the RS ding-dong to 
the silver cap with a screw.

It looks kind of funky, but when you put the two piece contraption back on 
the fuse box, it is really not noticeable.

My RS ding-dong was so noisy that I had to glue a piece of foam on the end 
of it.  I would recommend getting the SMALLEST noise maker from RS, and not 
try for the esthetics.

For my 'Attention dummy, you left your lights on again' alert warning, I did 
get the smallest RS noise maker.  It was a buzzer.

So now I have a buzzer for my lights on, and a ding-dong for the door open 
and key on alert.  (Fight terrorism, be ALERT: this country needs more 
lerts. &lt;&lt;--  sorry for this feeble attempt at humor &gt;&gt;)

&gt;I wish I never hooked mine back up, every time I open the door with the key
&gt;in it sounds like the bus is screaming.
