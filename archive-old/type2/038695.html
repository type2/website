Content-Disposition: inline

drove to the inspection station with no brakes, hoping to slide through and get
a sticker. He looked it over structurally
and said it was okay except for no brakes, so I tackled the brakes. Adjusting
stars totally frozen, adjusting screw sheared
off in the star anchor piece. removed master cylinder and servo, both were toast
and full of water, rust etc.

Ordered used replacements from Way Out Salvage, readjusted the date on my
inspection sticker and hunker down, awaiting parts and hoping the traffic police
look the other way.
