Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '78 Westy exhaust pipes??

The application on the late model VW bus is to carry away heated
air, not exhaust.  It's like a heater duct running from the
flapper valves aft to 2&quot; steel pipes which terminate below the
rear bumper.  The point of all this plumbing is to carry away
heat from the heater boxes when they are not heating the cabin.

Stock corregated cardboard/aluminum heater duct tubing doesn't
hold up to the elements beneath a bus.  That stuff does just
fine within the shelter of the engine room.  But add wet, road
debris and heat found beneath a bus, and it won't last long.

Back in '95, I chose to use something similar to this stuff:
&lt;http://www.westmarine_dot_com/webapp/commerce/command/ProductDisplay?prmenbr=201&amp;prrfnbr=9277&amp;outlet=&gt;
It has to be cut with a hacksaw.  It's tough.  Probably about
as overkill for this VW bus application as flexible exhaust pipe.

YMMV
