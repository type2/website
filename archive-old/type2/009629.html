&gt;From: Erik Meltzer:
&gt;
&gt;Modern engine oil, be it dino or synthetic, contains,
&gt;among other clever stuff, additives, which are there to
&gt;keep the engine clean.  To achieve this, they keep the
&gt;dirt and debris afloat, so as to be able to carry it
&gt;into the filter.
&gt;

I have been trying to research all the info on oil on the web, mainly DINO, 
concerning viscosity and temps. I haven't found all yet. I did find this 
piece of interesting info. It comes from 'Lubrication Notes from Redline' at 
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html  from the section 
Viscosity Index Improvers:

Rubber and Plastic Polymers

&quot;Start with a base of straight weight oil. Then add a polymeric thickener. 
When hot, the long polymer chain is really moving around, causing the oil to 
flow less. When cold, the polymers stick to each other, essentially coming 
out of suspension. The polymers are stable up to about 210F, where they 
start to break up. The drawbacks to VI polymers is that they can cause 
engine dirt because of their low shear strength.&quot;

The base of 20W/50 is 20 weight, so when the polymers break up you are left 
with 20 weight oil.

I believe a lot of people say their engines run around 220 to 240??

Shearing is caused by tight clearances and forcing oil between it, such as 
can gears and oil pumps.

I found a lot of other info but I am trying to put it together for a Friday. 
I am also waiting for a reply from Castrol.
