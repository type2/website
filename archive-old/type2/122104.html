Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

Right - I understand where you're coming from. My point is, there are people 
who have much greater NEEDS than a person who's lost the LUXURY of being 
able to own a bus as a primary vehicle.
I don't have any problem with anyone who wants to donate stuff, but for ME 
there more important things to take care of first. That's why I volunteer my 
time at the local soup kitchen, instead of the local VW shop. No Lie. I 
EXPECT that what I put out will come back.

I obviously appreciate the fun of owning a bus, as I OWN one, but I consider 
it a LUXURY. The NEEDS of my family necessitate that I have a safe reliable 
vehicle for them.

That person did not ask for dontations, as you noted, but I didn't pull this 
out of my butt - SOMEONE ASKED.

So before you condemn me to the 9th plane, understand the true nature of my 
point.
