Subject: Re: [T2] Checking for fuel

That's what I'm going to do. In fact I was at my NAPA store yesterday and
would have bought one, ($43.00) but they did not have it in stock.  I'll
call few stores to see if I can find one in stock.

This also gives me an idea for a quick check, I should be able to clamp a
lenght of fuel line to the stub, feed it outside the engine compartment
and be able to see if the pump if delivering any fuel.

Thanks
John R

&gt; --spend 40 bucks and get a pressure gauge that reads 0-50 psi. 
&gt; attach to the appointed stub between #3/4. 
&gt; 
&gt; with this tool you can test for fuel, test fuel pump, and pressure
