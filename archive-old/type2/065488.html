Subject: good smells

That distinctive VW smell is one of my fondest memories... I had a 2nd
grade teacher (Mrs. Prebus) whom I adored. She and her husband had a blue
bug, and two or three of her favorite students would get to take weekend
field trips all over Ohio and Michigan in that thing - Dearborn Museum,
Black Swamp nature preserve, art museums, zoos, etc. I can still smell that
car! Perhaps this is why the only cars I have ever owned have been VWs?

70 neunsitzer that smells like the two dogs getting hauled around in it
65 pritschenwagen which smells of deruster fluid and a cat who nested in
the cargo bay!
