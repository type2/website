Subject: strange engine sound ('72)

A friend's engine started to make an unusual sound after the owner had
pulled a head, had it rebuilt, and put back in. He taped the sound and I
posted it on my web site at
http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/bus-stuff.html
The engine is from a '72 bus.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated (dakhlia_at_simplecom_dot_net). Thanks.

Sami
