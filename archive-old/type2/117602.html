&gt; Doing a complete axl rebuild on my 76 and wanted to know of a good source for 
&gt; the swing lever bushings. My steering was sloppy before teardown and all other

&gt; 405 317B) is NLA. Saw in the archives where people were talking of replacing 
&gt; them with a kit of some sort. Any clues as my 69 needs some too.
