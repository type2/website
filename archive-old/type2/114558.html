&gt;  my curiosity was raised over this CD-Rom that Bentley has 
&gt;(recently?) put out featuring microfiches at a hefty cast of $99.  It 
&gt;sounds tempting considering how comprehensive it claims to be but I'd 
&gt;never never do anything too rash without consulting the list.  First, 
&gt;has anybody used this?  And to all you retailers out there... can you 
&gt;beat the price?

The online diagrams at &lt;http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/ft2.htm&gt; come from ETKA (VW's online parts database). They don't sell it.

What Bentley sells is a CD version (with terrible software I might ad) of the Volkswagen Type 2 workshop manual that everyone refers to as the yellow book.

I think the money would be better spent on a copy of the yellow book from eBay than getting the CDs. The CDs only work on windows, only allow one install, aren't searchable because they are scanned from the manuals not imported via OCR. The underlying technology is PDF but the Bentley software has obscured this with an annoying interface. My recommendation is not to buy it.
