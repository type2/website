I really agree with Sami , the best thig you can do is to test and prove
what is working,,, as we found out with Peter's Gauge system.... there was 2
things wrong,,, a defective vibrator / voltage stabilizer and the sender..
I wish you luck,  if you need some assistance other that Sami's really nice
pages, try the type2_dot_com library under the &quot;G&quot;  you'll see Gauge operation,
the tech article I wrote is there and seems to be easy to
follow,,,hahahaha..If *I* do say so myself!

&gt;Dave,
&gt;
&gt;To determine whether the gauge or the sender is faulty, disconnect the
&gt;sender and connect various resistors instead:
&gt;
&gt;10 Ohm should give you a full reading
&gt;22 Ohm should give you a 1/2 full reading
&gt;47 Ohm should give you an empty reading
&gt;
&gt;If you get those readings, then the gauge is fine and the sender is not.
&gt;Also look at the procedure i had scanned at
&gt;http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/images/VW-manual.html

&gt;&gt; My fuel gauge works sort of. Full is full, But empty is at half. It only
&gt;&gt; uses top half of gauge. My question is does this mean the sender is the
&gt;&gt; problem or the gauge?
