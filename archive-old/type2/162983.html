Subject: Re: [T2] Re: getting rid of points

Thanx Ray Robertson for good straight salesmanship.

&gt;I could recuse myself from this discussion, but I'll just say up 
&gt;front that I sell Hot-Spark electronic ignition conversion kits. 
&gt;But I'll try to be objective here.
&gt;
&gt;When using &quot;electronic ignition&quot; or points replacement conversions, 
&gt;dwell angle and timing don't deteriorate, so the engine always has 
&gt;that &quot;fresh tune up&quot; feel to it - ignition-wise, anyway.

	Your spiel was as good as I've seen.  I doubt any serious 
fault will be argued.  That leaves the question, how much worse does 
an ignition system drift if maintained as part of more or less 
regular checks of fuel, ignition, brakes, etc.  Because the typical 
T2 is often near full power, owners are likely to keep them near 
optimal tune.  How much work does that typically entail?


&gt;  The extra dwell time before the coil fires allows the coil to build 
&gt;up a bigger charge, resulting in a hotter spark at the plugs.

	That's a plausible theory which I'm fwding for comment to 
experts.  A contemporary of mine, inventor of the PowerBeat battery 
and pretty clued up on ignition, says typical coil ignition systems 
barely manage to ignite the mixture, with uncomfortably small 
margins.  The joules of energy delivered in a typical spark barely 
suffice.  More energy is one solution; a series of sparks is another; 
a 2nd (10mm) plug another.  Is capacitative discharge near 
unchallenged?
	 Beefing up one part of a coil ignition system may of course 
put extra stress on some other component.  The 'weakest link' concept 
has some relevance.


&gt;  With electronic ignition, dwell and timing don't drift and deteriorate.

	Routine drift in dwell &amp; timing amount to little in a 
well-maintained non-electronic system.  CHT etc can help keep on top 
of these driftings.


&gt;Electronic ignition provides quicker starts, smoother idling, better 
&gt;gas mileage and a bit more power than breaker points ignition.

	One way to look at this is to ask how far from optimal must 
the std system drift before these differences emerge to significant 
extents.  Is there any real advantage of electronic ignition over a 
top-maintained, &amp; lucky, std system, other than lower maintenance?


&gt;  We did have a problem with the Compu-Fire &quot;distributorless&quot; system 
&gt;- The coil-pack (four coils on one board) had a high failure rate.

	Saab had a similar system with 4 coils and no distributor. 
The Jawa 350 twin 1946 thru at least 64 had the same basic idea - 
two sets of points, 2 coils, lobes on crankshaft.

&gt;
&gt;Compufire and Pertronix ignition kits for VW cost about $60-70; the 
&gt;Hot-Spark electronic ignition conversion kit for VW costs about $40. 
&gt;They're all available in versions for stock vacuum-advance dizzies 
&gt;or in a version for 009 or 050 centrifugal-advance distributors.

	Those are impressively low prices.  Let's hope durability 
works out OK.  I expect lower maintenance will popularise electronic 
ignition.
