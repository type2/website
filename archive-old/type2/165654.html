Hi Kevin,

ROFL....

Welcome to the list!  You wanna get confused about modern buses, try  
joining the vanagon list. They go on forever about the propane  
powered refridgerator, power steering, liquid cooling and so on. I  
myself consider an early baywindow as vintage, as my own 1973/74/79  
westfakia has many more modern features like the type4 engine,  L- 
Jetronic fuel injection, &quot;crash-proof&quot; bumpers, and so on.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
