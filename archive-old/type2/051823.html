Subject: Re: [T2] Why do we paint tin?

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Some of the tin does get very hot.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Very hot???  What parts??  
&gt; 
The tin that runs directly under the exhaust manifolds, right under the 
heads, on a 2000cc engine. Mine got hot. It's got heat discoloration in 
the area near the manifold. Had I put rustoleum on there, it would have 
burned.
