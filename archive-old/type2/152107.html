&gt; I am going to have a '78 engine rebuilt and R&amp;R the '76 setup with the '78
&gt; engine setup.

why not have the 76 rebuilt as a 78 with hyd lifters etc.

&gt; I have a full wire harness for the '78, and an extra ECU for the '78.
&gt;
&gt; Is there anything I should be aware of before I try this quick swap??\

murphy will get in there somehow.... good luck
