Subject: [T2] bumper over-riders

i've seen a number of 68-71 buses with vertical overiders with rubber pads 
on the outside...and some without..my 71 Westy doesn't seem to have ever had 
these (can't detect any mounting holes)...were these like an option or 
something? they look cooler than just a plain blade...
