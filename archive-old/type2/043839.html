Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Distributer

I think that I had a leaky distributor too.. or it was the leaky oil
pressure switch(changed it for 5 bux).  One of the two.  I would lose
about a quart every 200 miles or so.  Just make sure you keep adding
oil.

When you take your distributor out, take a look at the o-ring.  If it's
flat with the distributor, then it's time to change it.  The new ring is
cheap so go pick one up.  It was such PAIN! to put the distributor in
with the new ring though.  It took alot of coaxing and oil to get it to
go in!  Finally I got it in and it is a really nice tight fit with no
more leaks.

&gt; Ok, so it sounds like I have to pull the distributer to put a new O ring in
&gt; there and/or check the distributer drive shaft(sorry if thats not the right
&gt; word).
&gt; 
&gt; So, is it bad to have this oil leaking out of the distributer(its not that
&gt; much)?  How long can I go before I fix it and what sort of performance
&gt; symptoms, if any, does this cause?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all your help.  I'm sure the mechanic will say he put a new o
&gt; ring in there, so I think I'm just gonna attempt this one myself.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
