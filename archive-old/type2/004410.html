Bussers:

I have a functional 1600 shortblock core, including flywheel and oil pump.
Got a shortblock from AVP, the Turtle is running great so far, 50 mi. on
rebuild.  The shipping would eat half of the core of $150, plus packing it
....  The rods have been balanced but need to be rebushed.  It ran great
until the piston rod slap forced me to teardown.  Everything else is within
spec.  Don't know the history but measurements indicate wear but not
wearout.  50 bucks.  Won't ship but I'll travel up to 100 miles to meet from
central Vermont.
