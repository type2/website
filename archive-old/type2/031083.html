&gt; I have a couple questions, but first a bit of background.  I am relatively
&gt; new to the list, though I have posted a couple questions in the past.

&gt; Well, specifically, how much am I looking at for a new or rebuilt engine?  I
&gt; see adds in the mags for engines in the area of $1500-2000, but is that all

there are no new 2 liter engines, rebuilding will cost about $1500-2000 if
done right, (NOT a crate engine and especially NEVER gex)

&gt; I need?  Are there other parts that need to be bought that are not

of course there will always be other parts on either bus

&gt; instant gratification.....I want it now!!  Also, what is the going rate for
&gt; a 76 Westy in pristine condition?  Is $4,500 too much?

it is worth what you are willing to pay for the instant gratification
