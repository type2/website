Subject: Unlikely get way vehicle...

For those that like spotting campers on TV..

A Channel 4 drama yesterday, called Ladybird, Ladybird
had a short scene when the heroine got away from 
the social services who were trying to get her child
away from her. 

And the get away vehicle? A red and white 1973/74 pop top 
camper, with her boyfriend at the wheel. It ploughed its way
across some grass, bounced down a kerb and kangerood its
way up the street before anyone knew what was happening.

Blues brothers it wasn't, but a classy escape none the less.
