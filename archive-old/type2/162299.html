Subject: Re: [T2] weird miss at part throttle.

Bob,

&quot; Spark energy is reduced greatly as engine revs rise. The problem becomes 
even worse in multicylinder installations having smaller points dwell 
times.&quot;

from here http://users.mrbean_dot_net.au/~rover/ketterin.htm

Excellent description of a Kettering Ignition System.

Basically, worse at high rpm's cause the coil doesn't have as
much time to build up a nice hot fat spark.


Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; coil is new, but wouldn't coil have more problems at high rpm rather than
&gt; low??
