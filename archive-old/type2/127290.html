Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

&gt; My bus did not come with a jack.  I have not seen any documentation stating what kind of jack to use or where to put it.  I have been using the floor jack, but I don't want to take that on a trip.  Is it a scissor jack?  Where is it stored?

no it was a screw jack and not all that good.
busdepot has a better newer scissor version
