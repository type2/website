&gt;And so moisture gets in there and fogs it up. you will never get an installer
&gt;to seal the edge of the replacement with roof tar, you will have to do
that job
&gt;yourself !  The steel wool trick is for removing fine scratches in the
surface,
&gt;but you would have better luck with cesium oxide, available from a jeweler
supply...
&gt;Any body else ?

Dave is right on.  If you install them yourself, using some silicone or
windshield install goop (sort of tarrish) will slow further fogging, but
what you got, you got.  A new safelight glass is about $95 installed
last I checked though you might from some listmembers experience
be better to have someone who knows how do the install instead.

As to surface scratches, I'll chime in that the stuff Eastwood sells
which is cesium oxide is worthless, but stuff my dad had indeed from
an old jewler friends tumbler could polish out even ridiculously deep
gouges on the '87 glass.  So deep that the resulting dip bends the
image but is clear.  Unfortunately I have no idea at all what the stuff
was.  It was gray, not white like the Eastwood stuff.  The stuff from
Eastwood would only polish the very VERY faintest of haze, and that
only slowly.  Used their buff though with the good stuff.
