Subject: Re: Engine movement

&gt; I took my engine out to change the fuel tank and in the process found out
&gt; that the guy I bought the bus off of, when he put a new clutch in, didn't
&gt; bother bolting the transmission back up.  [snip]

We just took the engine out of my new bus for maintenance work and found
that it was being supported by only three bolts and the engine mounts were
barely in there. The PO had the transmission rebuilt. Whoever did the work
also snipped the heater cables.

So what if you have some bolts and stuff left over, right?  argh.
