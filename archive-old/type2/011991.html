Subject: headliner question
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I am looking to install some kind of headliner for my
71 westy.  I have toyed with the idea of using double
sided carpet tape and material from a local fabric
store.  Right now there is thin plywood up there.  I
am not even sure if there was a fabric liner on the
original or the whitish yellow luann type stuff that
is on the side walls and door panel.  I have also
considered just taping pictures up there from previous
camping trips.  Does anyone have any advice/stories?

Thanks

Rich
