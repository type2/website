First I would take a look at your bentley where it describes the shift
lever mount.  Under there is a piece of metal that keeps you from 
putting the tranny in reverse without pushind down on the stick.  If
this piece breaks, it could cause your shifter to get kinda sloppy.  It
was broken on mine (76 campmobile :)

&gt; Hello Listers:
&gt; 
&gt; While stopped at a light today and preparing to shift to 1st gear the shift
&gt; lever in my '76 Campmobile suddenly felt &quot;loose&quot;.  My right arm and the
&gt; shift lever headed off in the direction of two o-clock and just kind of
&gt; flopped around.  I was soon able to engage first gear and continue driving
&gt; more or less uneventfully.  There are no strange noises from the tranny and
&gt; shifing is, otherwise, smooth.
&gt; 
&gt; On returning home later today I experienced the same phenomenon.  Does this
&gt; sound familiar?  Are there bushings to be replaced?  Loose linkage?  What
&gt; should I look for to fix this before it becomes worse?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help and suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Walt Fogle
