Subject: how long should it take to install a front beam?

My bus is in the shop to have the front beam replaced. The one they were going to put on turned out to be rusted from the inside. I ordered one from Bus-Boys and am awaiting its arrival. 
As of now, the old beam is off and the bus is waiting for the new one to go back on when UPS delivers it.
How long (ball park estimate)should it take a single experienced VW mechanic in a shop (and possibly one helper) to build up a stripped beam and install it?
