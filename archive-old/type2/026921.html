Dear Jay.

More than 20 years ago, I fitted a front-panel mounted spare wheel carrier, 
to my 1973 VW Type 2. Instead of using the cavity fixings supplied with the 
carrier, I used home-made, removable, reinforced 1.25 inch wide stainless 
steel straps, with welded captive nuts, positioned behind the front panel. 
These were manoeuvred into position, by pulling on a piece of string, fed 
through the bolt holes.

Regards.

          Nigel A. Skeet
