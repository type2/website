Subject: RE: [T2] Lack of Confidence in Van

&gt;Modern vehicles are much more reliable, but most failures put you at the
&gt;mercy of the mechanic (unknown to you if you are on the road) who can read
&gt;the codes and replace the widget the computer tells him to replace.  For a
&gt;while there the car's computer would read out the codes to anyone with a
&gt;paper clip to short the terminals, but these days you need a $200-$1000+
&gt;device to get the same information.  Progress...

Actually what you need is a $200 piece of hardware/software and an old laptop.

&gt;&quot;Modern&quot; cars have their problems too.  There are several problems
&gt;reported on the Honda newsgroup concerning various honda models burning
&gt;their valves around 70,000 miles.  Seems that Honda specifies a 110,000
&gt;mile valve adjustment interval and that's just too long to wait.  The bad
&gt;news is that 70K miles is well out of warranty and Honda just says &quot;so
&gt;sorry!&quot; when they hand the customer a $2500 bill for the repair.

Um, ahhh, I'm going home to check the valve adjustment on my '99 CR-V. Now 
- I'm worried! &lt;grin&gt;

66,780 miles....
