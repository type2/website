&gt; On the way to work today I spotted a LHD European Westy circa 1971 (i think).

&gt; 2.Can someone explain how the tailights work on a Euro bus? It appears that 
&gt; they are two filament or something like that?

As Bob Hufford allready said, yes, top is 21W turnsignal, bottom is 21/5W stop/tail,
didn't know about the seals, i love this list :)

&gt; 1.Does anyone else know what other peculiarities a 1971 Euro Westy  
&gt; might have as compared to the more common N. American 
&gt; Westy's of that vintage?

I can name some differences but not for the '71 in particular

emmission equipment + distributor, seatbelt warning light, the heater 
dash-lights i heard about, charcoal cannister, headlights, running-lights, 
text on turnsignal and wiper levers, the text and sign on the 
hazardlight-switch-lens, warning stickers maybe, the 'thing' in the speedo cable,
owner manual, brakefluid reservoir, EGR etc. warninglights, valvelash/octane/
tirepressure stickers, often most changes for the US or Canada market are 
identified by one single M-code.

my .02, hope it helps,

Brian.
