&gt; That's the second inquiry this list has seen this week on pop-top

&gt; in case anyone else might be lurking.

I will also throw out that an even easier way to add more headroom to
the bus is by finding a Sportsmobile top. These tops tend to have more
room under them (mostly due to a stright pop up like the rivera) &amp; can
provide a penthouse upstairs for the kids to sleep. Installation is a
snap (well compared to putting on a real westfalia top). Instead of
all that welding all you need is a really big hole in the roof of your
bus &amp; some screws. The frame that the fiberglass hooks to is
substantial &amp; seems to make up for any loss of structural strength.
Eventually I will write a article on how it did it, but till then look
here for what the product looks like.

The top is, in my opinion one of the goofyest looking pop tops out
there, but it matches the driver in my case :)
