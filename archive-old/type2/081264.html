Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?) 

I agree the distortion thing is probably not an issue and the annealing MAY
not be an issue either (it is a big hunk of metal!).  I just wouldn't try
it.  You got a press???  Now I'm really jealous!

&gt; What are your concerns regarding heating the trailing arm?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry if I seem like I'm quizzing you on this, but I'm curious how other
people do this. I did all four joints on my '71 recently, and did heat the
trailing arms, since I wanted to get started and my press hadn't been
delivered yet. I also pressed the joints myself once my press arrived, which
was interesting. Heating the trailing arms did not seem to have any negative
effect on the press-fit of the ball joint, nor was there any noticeable
distortion of the arm.

&gt; myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
&gt; (unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place that
knows
&gt; what their doing.
