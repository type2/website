Subject: Re: [T2] long front bumper

&gt; Where do busses get those longer white front bumpers with the bix
&gt; quare box over the nose mounted tire? Was that an EU option only?
&gt;
&gt; Yes this is a euro thing. Some countrys have laws against mounted the
&gt; spare tire on the front of the vehicle (it's probably a good idea).
&gt; The bumper and square box is to house the spare tire.

I just dont get how its any safer. The spare is still between the nose and
the collision. Why does it matter what its attached to?
I would better understand a prohibition from modifying the front bumper
and crumple area whatsoever.
