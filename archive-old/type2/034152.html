Subject: 1971 bus retrofit

Hi Volks:

New to this list. Formerly owned a 1971 Bus, loved it
and stupidly sold it. (I'm not that sharp.)

I have two questions based on the collective
experience of this list.

1) Has anyone every retrofit a 1971 Westy with the 75'
and later interior and top? I don't remember the
details of the roof hole well enough to know whether
it would work well (as in 'bolt up easily.)

2) What years were the automatic available for the
Bus, and how well does it work? Don't bother warning
me about crumby performance, mileage, etc. These I
know about. What I want to know is HOW RELIABLE are
they.

The only way I'm probably going to get my wife into a
Westy is if it has and auto, and I'm not so flush with
cash I can just stroll out and pick up a fully loaded
'89 Vanagon.

Besides, I like the 'musical' nature of the
aircoolers.

Thanks.

RMW
