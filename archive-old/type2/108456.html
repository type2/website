Subject: Re: [T2] Pinion bearing?

Setting the pinion depth and backlash will be required
after bearing replacement. Compared to the difficulty
you have had setting the timing on your 009,
this repair is off the scale. Don't be discouraged.
Get the CD from Long Enterprises, and amaze yourself
with the info provided in your Bentley manual.
Consider this- find the fill plug and remove it.
Put your finger in the hole- any gear oil in there ?
Remove the drain plug and empty the old gear oil
into a clean white bucket. That plug has a magnet on it.
If you find steel fuzz, that is normal. You are searching
for metal chunks. Any is too many. Refill to the level of
the fill plug and road test. You may just be low on oil now.
But the original diagnosis is a definate possibility.

Subject: [T2] Pinion bearing?


&gt; In my 69 I've noticed that in all gears but mainly 1st and 2nd there is a
&gt; fairly loud groan. I drove around the block (not registered yet) and put
in the
&gt; clutch while moving in second and the noise goes away. After talking with
the
&gt; local VW flaps and he said it might be the pinion bearing and that they
didn't
&gt; do that kind of work anymore. I asked him about the possibility of me
doing it
&gt; and he said that it required a special jig to set all the inards of the
tranny
&gt; back up to ensure proper fit or something to that effect. Anyway, has
anybody
&gt; done this and if so rate difficulty based on never having done any tranny
work.
&gt; I checked out a site called Long Enterprises and it's very good for the
novice
&gt; and they offer a CD &quot;VW Transaxle Rebuilders Course&quot; for $24.95+S/H.
Opinions
&gt; please.
