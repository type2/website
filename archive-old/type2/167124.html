Subject: RE: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

The Haynes manual talks about using a tyre lever to relieve residual tension
in the torsion bar.  After a quick search on the internet it looks like this
tool is used to remove tires from wheels.  Anyone had experience with a tyre
lever or other tools used to relieve the torsion bar tension?

&gt; plus it is nearly impossible to get this correct on the first go, &gt; even
with the factory tools to measure. if you are doing the &gt; adjustment, plan on
taking it apart at least one extra time to get it &gt; perfect.&gt; &gt; Scott Lyons&gt;
