Subject: Problem using 34 PICT Carb on 1600DP

I'm in the process of building a 1600 DP for my 71 Bus using the
distributor and carb from a 73 Super Beetle.  Problem is that the 34
PICT used on the 73 Beetle doesn't have all the taps that the 34 PICT
used on the 71 Bus.  It only has one tap and that is for the vacuum
advance.  There is no tap on the carb for the retard side of the
diaphram.  The retard vacuum appears to come from a manifold tap just
below the carb on the 73 Beetle.

I'm planning to forget about the retard and just leave the retard port
on the diaphram open.  I'll just time the engine to 34 BTDC at 3500
RPM.  Anybody see anything wrong with this?

I guess I could tap the manifold but I'd rather avoid this.
