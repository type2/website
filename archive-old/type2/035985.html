&gt;I am guessing that by squeezing the handle, brake fluid is drawn out of

&gt;pump reservoir and exit through a break in the pipe (the break is 
&gt;submerged in brake fluid).

&gt;Have I got it right? Because if I do, some clear hose, a jelly jar, and 
&gt;one of those pumps that fits on a drill chuck (8.95) will do the same job.

That's an idea that deserves an experiment. Carefull you don't suck the
reservoir dry in 3.14159 seconds.
