&gt;what is a good solvent for cleaning oil/grease off of and out of a case
&gt;and/or engine parts? 

I use plain old gasoline.  I've got a can in the shed with the words
&quot;Solvent Gas&quot; painted on it.  The gas works fine; occasionally requries some
scrubbing (no steel brushes!--use nylon, which dies after a while, or
bristle).   When I'm done cleaning whatever I pour the gas back into the
can,  and use rags or paper towels to sop out my solvent tub.  The rags I
put in water with a *lot* of Dawn dishwashing soap (cuts oil/grease very
well) &amp; p.towels go into the outdoor trash can.   BTW, don't put gas-soaked
rags into the washer or the dryer.  Just wash them like
crazy in a bucket &amp; hang on the fence (or something) to dry...

Yes, it's tremendously flammable, but I only use it in the shed (very well
ventilated) or outside.  And I never use it on/with anything which could
produce sparks, thus the no steel brush warning.  I ought to wear rubber
gloves, too, but I usually don't...  I figure any solvent is flammable &amp;
probably poisonous besides, and gas is cheap &amp; available.   My opinions,
modified with many cautions.  I'm starting to sound like my Mother (or maybe
Martha Stewart's Greasy Living)
