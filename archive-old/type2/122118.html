Subject: Re: [T2] DIPSTICK GASKET LEAK

&gt;Start the new tube onto the &quot;long&quot; metal line that you just took the old
&gt;one off of. Rotate it a bit to make it slip on easier. It's a slow process
&gt;and the new tube needs to be fairly soft (which is why I said don't do it
&gt;in the cold). When it's all the way on you can lube the other metal line a
&gt;bit and slide it on so it covers the gap.

As mentioned above, It is indeed much easier if the new boot is soft.  To 
soften it up, right before you are about to install the new boot,  just 
throw it in a pot of boiling water.  It'll soften up and slip right on.  
I've ripped a few new boots trying to put them on cold/hard.  I've never had 
a problem using this trick, might want to give it a try.
