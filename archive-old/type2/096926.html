Dear Billy and List:

Not to get into the middle of something, but I feel my question was 
valid.   I am not &quot;hosing&quot; anyone nor am I &quot;waving an order&quot; over 
anyone's head.   The Bus Depot had the parts I needed, and I was all 
set to place an order before I saw a couple of negative posts.

Isn't that what this list is for?  Advice?   There is nothing 
personal against Ron or anyone else.  I am only a customer looking 
for the best supplier.   If vendor problems are off-limits to this 
list (as they are on some others I belong to) that needs to be made 
clear to people joining the list.

Thanks for all those who replied, but please no more on Pop Top Vendors!

Sorry for causing a ruckus,

BEN
