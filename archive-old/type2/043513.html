i just noticed the header was for trailer hitches
and not tow bars, and so george lyle followed
me there. .....nevermind......  :)

p.s. anybody have a solution to the tow bar problem ?
p.p.s.s. i made the late bus rear bumper work for a trailer
hitch by welding in 1/4 inch angle iron to stiffen it. also
moved the bumper bracket mount from the chassis to the
engine mount  with 1/8 inch wall square tubing. much safer...
