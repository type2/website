Subject: Re: [T2] 79 west wind noise

Have you pulled off the grill and checked the vent flapper. Sounds like it 
is flapping in the wind.


&gt;I've checked the library and archive and I can't seem to find info on a
&gt;jarring rattling noise that comes from my '79 westy at high speeds, and
&gt;especially when driving into a stiff wind. At times it sounds like my whole
&gt;dash is vibrating but I disassembled everything on the inside, and isolated
&gt;the sound to either the front window seal, or the fiberglass top. Does
&gt;anyone have any information on where the noise might come from, and what I
&gt;can do to get rid of it?
