 Richard(and others),
 
 What is the purpose of the vac hose that goes over
 to the air cleaner?
 
 I started looking at the diageam at www.ratwell_dot_com
 and realized mine was 
 different!  No hose to air cleaner from the
 distributor tees.
 
 There is no preheat to the air cleaner, so nothing
 to activate inside 
 there?...or is there?
 
 and what for?

If you are referring to the one going to the round
thing on the front [front is front] of the housing.
That is the EEC valve. Evaporative Emissions Valve
The ported vacuum opens the valve while you are
driving to allow the cannister [the large hose] to
purge using venturi vacuum. 

You are probably missing the vac line because the
valve leaks and you would need to replace the air
cleaner housing to get a good valve.
