Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

Like Jamie, I placed an order and got the great discount, and prompt
service, and everything I ordered. With no problems. I got the terrific
jack, and the drink holders. Good stuff, good service.
And thanks to Ron for the great offer.

&gt; I also placed an order on Ron's triple discount day.  The order arrived
&gt; promptly.  I was missing three seals and immediately e-mailed Ron.  This
&gt; was on the 16th.  I received a call from Dan the next day to check up on
&gt; the order and to see how I was doing.  Well, I received the seals that I
&gt; was missing, today.  No complaints just praises of The Bus Depot.  Thanks
&gt; again Ron and crew for your service and the gracious offer that you gave
&gt; the list!
