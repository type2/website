Subject: RE: RE: bbbbbVI/hotel info

Buses by the Bridge host hotel.
I have gotten a pretty decent discount for those coming to BBB VI and want
to stay in a hotel.
The island inn hotel is across the street from BBB VI and is walking
distance. Mention BBB VI or AARP or AAA and recive a 10% discount on your
room, which would be $44.00 plus taxes. There are plenty of rooms available.
Below is the information, hope this helps those that have asked.
