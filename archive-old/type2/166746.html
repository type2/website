Subject: RE:[VB] 71 front beam

I got this book &quot;how to modify volkswagen bus suspension, brakes and 
chassis for high performance&quot;
by james Hale covers 1950 -1979
I have a 67 and want disc brakes. this book covers it. you can just buy 
some conversions. wolfgang has a kit many kits around some require 15 &quot; 
wheels.
swapping beams is not a swicha roo. a shop featured in the book &quot;harry 
harpic's says that the 68 and 69 are close to fitting and get the ball 
joit but raise the front
they I quote&quot;bymilling down the bearing surface of bay window bus 
torsion bar arms by 6 mm, they could be made to fit straight into 
earlier beams, and enhance split screen busses with a ball jointed 
front end and disc brakes.&quot; they go on&quot;fitting a stock 68 or 69 front 
suspension to an earlier bus...will raise the front end.&quot;
I personally wrote Harry and he wrote back (snail mail) he is in the UK
There is no easy or cheap way . There were some brazil spindles that 
were great but I heard that supply is no more
Maybe they found a new source.
For me the single most important mod i want to do is to have disc 
brakes at least in the front.
I figure 1000 dollars and up I have not done it yet . my 67 drives slow 
and I want to keep every thing as stock as possible. no lowering. I 
have a 1500.
May be I will build a nother engine but which configuration?
The second thing I want is a real trailer hitch. They exist. I am told 
that in germany the trailer hitch is part of the vehicle so you cant go 
buy a junk yard hitch.
I have fit over a ton of fence in the bus but I want to rig for camping 
and may be be able to pull a trailer to home depot or tow a car. I have 
not found a hitch that goes fowd to the tortsion.
people some one must know or have a drawing. it is like trying to find 
a perfect spouse
