Hello fellow V-dubbers,

    I finally got to borrow a digital camera and put up some pics of my
VW's.  The link below should take you there.  Also pictured is my '74 organ
donor bus.   You've all been so good to me with questions in the past and I
owe a great big thank you to those who've helped me come up with parts I've
needed.  Now that I've got a few extra parts laying around, let me know if
you're searching for something I might have on my '74.

-Brad in Oregon
    '72 Riviera Camper
    '74 Organ Donor Bus
    '63 Beetle
    P.O. of various other VW's
