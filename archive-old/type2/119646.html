They sell it to a reprocessing plant, or at the very least have a contract 
for removal.

I've been told by some straight veggie oil (SVO) burners that restaurants 
typically pay to have it taken away.  Whatever you remove for &quot;free&quot; reduces 
either the volume of grease or the frequency with which they have to pay to pay 
someone to remove it.  

I'm guessing (and hoping) that if you don't create a hassle or a mess, they 
(particularly non-franchise restaurants) don't mind much.
