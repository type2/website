I have only owned this bus for a year, I put it in my mechanics yard for
windscreen repairs. This turned into new half front panel from 4&quot; up A
pillars to half way through high indicators! Also some rust around side
windows &amp; top half re-spray.
 That was last winter, this year I am changing full front wheel arch &amp; step
one side &amp; skin the other. One full rear wheel arch &amp; one repair plus new
rear valance &amp; a corner (lower). I am also going to do some interior work
etc.. Therefore LOADS of questions are on my mind &amp; I don't want to start a
spatter of threads all based on &quot;Re:winter work&quot; So I'm going to post each
question separately, if anyone has a prob with this, let me know. But any
questions will be AFTER I've done a search, but I do have loads of Q's - Be
afraid, Be VERY Afraid!
