Subject: Sorry! Tire Questions.

I hate to beat a dead horse, but I just noticed something funky with my
tires.

I put on Yakahama 356 tires awhile ago I was just going to rotate them
(back to front on the same side). I ordered four load range D tires.  I
just noticed that I have been ripped off, and they put on load range D on
the front and C on the back! I won't be able to take it in to get them to
give me the Ds that I paid for for a week or so, as I am going on roadtrip
tomorrow and have a lot to do before then.

It seems to me that it would be better to have the Ds on the back, and the 
C's in front, but I am concerned about the handling with the squishy tires 
in front. Thoughts on this?

On a slightly more off topic note, I put two new tires on my wifes truck, 
as she had tread separation on one of the old tires. It is front wheel 
drive, but the tire guy insisted that the new tires must go on the back, 
or the care will handle poorly. This doesn't jive with me, but what do I 
know? Is the tire guy right or what?

Thanks,
-Nick
