The other day when filling my tank I noticed a small amount of gas had
accumulated under my bus at the filler area indicating a leak.  I drove the
block home and could smell a strong gas smell all the way.

My bus is a 75 and the manual says you can barely remove the tank cover
without removing the motor.  I have remover the six screws that hold the cover
on but cant get it to come free.  I think it is just stuck from being in place
for so many years but am afraid to bend it and want to be assured I am not
missing anything.

I know so many of us have had a fuel leakage problem lately, I would like to
receive you advice.   FYI all fuel lines from the tank outlet motor and return
to tank were replaced six mounts ago.  I am thinking it is the filler tube
that has been a hot topic the past week or so or other lines in the tank
compartment I was not aware of.
