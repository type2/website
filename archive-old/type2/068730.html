Subject: Re: heater blower

&gt;&gt;  I don't think so.  On my old '78 it would run anytime the key was on and
&gt;&gt;  the right-side red lever was down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Besides, if that was the case, we wouldn't be talking about it running
&gt;&gt;  for a little while and then blowing fuses.

&gt;&gt; If the above is correct then the blower has been re-wired.  It receives its
&gt;&gt; power through a relay which is 'conditioned' by the state of the alternator
&gt;&gt; charge-indicator lamp circuit -- the alternator must be delivering a charge
&gt;&gt; before the heater blower will operate.

&gt;Well, ya learn something new every day.  All the wiring looked
&gt;normal/stock but I guess not.  Sorry I ever doubted you Craig :)
&gt;So, how many people's blower fans actually only work when the alternator
&gt;is charging?

When I got my heat worked on before coming up here last year (early January
this year, I guess), I remember the guy showing me the fan running with the
engine off.  But at the same time, I don't think I was ever really careful
about putting the lever up whenever I got out of the car- so this might
mean that he somehow just showed me that with the engine on and I'm
retarded.  See, I thought that the fan should run with the engine off, and
I tried that first and when that didn't work I DID start the engine (with
the lever down already) and that's when the fan went for about three
seconds and then stopped, blown fuse.  What I am going to do is this: go
out with a flashlight and try to take the fan/motor off right now, and take
it apart while I do my radio show tonight.  Even if the fan doesn't ppush
much air up to me (which I hope it does!) I want it to work.  Also, I will
try to check the heater tubes this weekend, because that will just be a
good thing to do regardless!
