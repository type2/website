Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95 

I try to stay about a bus length behind dead center.

I won't do it for long as I am a chicken-shit and
more than once the driver has tried to scrape me
off on slower moving traffic (abrupt lane change
with no signals at the last second, etc.).  Not
that I blame them -- some goofball (me) hanging
on their freaking bumper.  But my Daddy was a
drafter[1] and he did it good so I gotta try from
time to time.  The decreased drag is remarkable,
which should come as no surprise as the air
resistance is proportional to velocity squared
(ask a competitive bicyclist what it is that
limits their speed).[2]

What I really want is a bit of terrain radar and
enough re-purposed avionics to maintain a locked
on, fixed following speed...
