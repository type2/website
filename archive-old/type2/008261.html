&gt; From: &quot;Tom Howze&quot; &lt;thowze_at_u.washington_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; I believe I have a sticky oil control valve.  This is the spring loaded
&gt; piston that is located on the left front bottom of the engine block (FIF).
&gt; Closest to the #3 cylinder.  This is different from the similar valve that
&gt; is on the rear right bottom of the engine, next to #2 cylinder...  If this
&gt; was sticking, would this prevent oil from getting to the oil cooler, hence
&gt; oil that is too hot all the time...?
&gt;
&gt; Or better yet, what role does this valve play in the oil system of my
&gt; engine?


You are a little confused. The FRONT plunger set up is designed
to control the pressure in the system.  When the overall pressure
gets too high (cold morning and reving engine) the plunger
moves down and dump oil back to the pan.
When it fails (As mine did last week), usually from a
piece of cooked oil, it sticks down and your pressure
goes to zero below 2000 RPM, but you still have pressure
above that.

The REAR plunger is the cooler bypass plunger. It is
pushed down when the oil is cold and thick too, but when pushed
down it vents the oil to the main bearing circuit. When the oil
warms up and thins out, it sends the cooling oil to the cooler
instead. When it sticks (and they stick less in my experience
because they move back and forth more often and get
more clean oil) the oil never makes it to the
cooler, so overheating can happen. Just as often, though, they
jam in the upper location and send oil to the cooler all the
time, causing a high pressure reading at the sender and a low
pressure at the main oil galleys. (Plus leaking oil cooler seals)

Whatever you do, a 'high pressure' kit with stronger springs
is NOT to be installed. You will do nothing more than blow 
oil cooler seals. Buy one and throw the springs away.
Use the new plungers, if the metal is machined well (mabye 10% of them).

Drain the oil, clean your plunger bores (a toothbrush with the bristles
cut to 1/2 height), make sure they slide all the way in and out on the tip
of a pencil. (Note: Dont use your little finger. I got mine caught in
the screw threads at the knuckle and had to 'unscrew' myself to
get it out. A 'German Finger Trap' puzzle) Overheating can 
be the results of everything from a stuck plunger to carbon
on the piston heads. If you really are sure it is the 
oil system, also pull off the cooler and install new seals and
back flush the cooler with solvent, then brake cleaner, then solvent.

Good luck with the system, and keep your little fingers out of
the oil relief holes. #:^)
