    Ok here's the deal my first VW was an '87 Jetta GLI
LOVED it, but I wrecked it 
Then I got DA-BUS, and I am NEVER parting with my bus!!!!!!!!!
but now that I'm all growed up and I'm facing a 50 mi commute to work (in Michigan winters)
I want to take the opportunity to do some restoration/ &quot;major&quot; work to DA-BUS,

I want another Jetta, but My wife (sorry honey)says I cant have another '87. So....

what years are good??

what model (GL, GLI, WOLFSBURG, ect.)

GAS or Diesel???

thanks

Mike 
'78 T2  &quot;DA-BUS&quot;
