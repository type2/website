Sorry, my last post didn't have the message in it.  You mentioned in an
earlier post the mechanism for a canvas bus sunroof. And I have one,
without canvas, but the hardware seems to be complete. I am currently
working on a 64 std micro and am always on the lookout for parts. If
anyone is interested in  the sunroof hardware, I would sell or trade or
whatever in order to keep it in the hands of the right people. Stuff
like this is too valuable to keep out of circulation.  John
