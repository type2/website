Subject: Re:Best Bus 68-79

I have owned about 20 type 2's, I guess, but many were nonrunners or
projects yet to be completed. Take away Vanagons, I'm down to a 69
double cab, 70, 72, 73automatic, 76, &amp; 78 Champagne Edition. Selecting a
favorite is a little like selecting a favorite child- you like and
dislike things about each. Having said that, I'd always prefer a 70 over
a 68 or 69, just because of the extra crash protection and stiffer front
torsion bars. I do like the funky old-timer look of the flat sides and
the round hub caps of these 3 years. The 73 automatic was easily the
biggest blast to drive in town, just because of the power and the
automatic. I suppose the same could be said of any automatic. The gas
mileage and top speed suffered, however. So, I think maybe the best
compromise for me is the 72, with its 66 hp 1700, and old-time funky
bumpers. Luckily I have one, and a 2055 motor from the 78, so
someday....
I think it is interesting that though this list includes 80-83 Vanagons,
not a single peep has been said in their defense. They are actually
incredibly good type 2's, but maybe they just don't inspire affection
like loafs. Anyone else have any feelings on this? (I just looked at the
subjectand realized it says 68-79, but that doesn't usually reign in
most participants!)
