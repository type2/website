&gt; So here I am in Maine freezing my baguettes off.  The Green Monster is

&gt; from it so that it can't do any damage (I hope).  I don't have much to
&gt; do today so I just went out there with the battery that I keep inside on
&gt; the trickle, fired the bus up, and stared at it.  Which made my day.  I
&gt; thought you guys could relate, perhaps, to this feeling - just counting
&gt; down the days/weeks until it is safe (and warm enough!) to get the thing
&gt; back on the road.

??? OK so maybe I wasn't down were you are but Lewiston/Auburn was cold
enough. Buses were made for driving, keep your's happy take it out to play
year round.
