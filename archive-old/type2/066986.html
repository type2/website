Subject: Re: --- where are you living??? ---

&gt; Where you live:

Memphis, Tennessee. A discrete distance from both Mississippi and Arkansas.
Thagya veruhbuch.

&gt; What is you van: year, model

1968 Westfalia. A late 68, I'm told, apparently that matters to parts people.

I am also bethrothed to a 62 single cab, whom I have never seen, rumored to
reside in North Arkansas. Further developments will be reported here.

&gt; What is your name:

Ken Hooper (34)
Daughters: Boy (7) and Cheetah (5), plus one on the way
Wife : The Cruise Director (ageless)
Dog: Anastasia (Irish Wolfhound)
Fish: (I don't think that goldfish has a name)

&gt; What is the name of your van:

The Big Red School Bus (christened by Miss Emily Buckner, a cousin, age three)

Services available: We're about four minutes off I-40, for those limping.
Campable back yard, carport, tools, phone, ride to FLAPS, whatever you
need. Two garages here that know busses inside and out, but that doesn't
mean I trust them. One VW FLAPS, surprising what they have in stock. No
junkyards, this ain't bus country,

Jean-Baptiste: thanks for doing this.

- --Ken
  68 Westy
