Subject: [T2] Clock question


&gt;When I bought my 78 Westy the previous owner gave me an analog German clock
&gt;which I assume was installed in earlier VW's. &gt;My question is, &quot;What amp
fuse should I use for the clock?&quot;
&gt;Thanks for the help.

&gt;Those Ziet clocks are bulletproof, I have one from a 78 Riveria in my 77. I
think there was already a place to hook it up. That baby is accurate and
still tickin.-Moe
