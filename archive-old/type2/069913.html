Subject: Re: NO CINDERBLOCKS!

&gt;I agree with Bill Abbot on NOT using Cinder Blocks......for jackstands

In my pre-VW days I bought a beatup non running '62 Jaguar Mk II that I had
dreams of Americanizing with a small block V-8.  I jacked it up and left it
on cinder blocks for a year or two (wheels on--didn't trust those cinder
blocks).  When it came time to sell it for parts (never did much with it but
dream--but it was a nice dream!) all I had to do was hit the cinder blocks
with a sledge hammer and the jag came down nicely.  So the advantage of
cinder blocks is you only have to use your jack once!! ;-)
