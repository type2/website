Subject: please help....

Okay, I've resorted to begging.  I've spent the last year having my '73 
camper restored and I'm stuck on one thing - I need the linkage that runs 
from the gear shifter to the transmission.  It's an automatic which I now 
know I should've coverted her to a manual when I had the chance but I've 
already spent a small fortune having the transmission rebuilt so I'm kinda 
stuck keeping her an automatic.

Anyways, if anyone is parting out an automatic between '73 and '75 or knows 
of a yard that has automatics or has a diagram that has specific details 
about the linkage - I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks - Felton
