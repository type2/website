Subject: Puzzled

Tried the jumper trick on the starter, ignition switch on, and the starter
simply spun.  The solenoid didn't throw the starter ram into place, and the
bus didn't start.

Am I doing something wrong?  Are you supposed to have someone holding the
key in the start position for this to work?

If I did this right, and the starter solenoid is shot, would it be okay to
pick up a used one or should I put out for a new one from the FLAPS?

Thanks.  I was thrilled to be in the seat of a bus again, and now I'm
heart-broken that it won't start... [sniff/sob]
