Subject: Re: [T2] PDP installations

Mark,

To my knowledge, the two items are not related.

All the untouched buses that I have ever seen had the styrofoam in the 
nose.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Fact # 1: My '76, Peregrine, had a PDP under-dash AC installed when I 
&gt; bought her. I stripped it out long ago.
 
 Fact # 2: There is 1&quot; styrofoam inside the nose of the bus that I'm 
 taking out now to do the body work there.
 
 Are these facts related? Did PDP include styrofoam insulation as part 
 of the installation package?
