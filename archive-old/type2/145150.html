Subject: Re: [T2] Progressive vacuum advance problem?

(merging your thread) 
There are exploded diagrams around. I thought I had one on my hard
drive, but I must have printed it off and deleted the electronic copy
:{. In just poking around my bookmarks, this site might be helpful for
adjusting the carb (http://www_dot_carburetion_dot_com/Weber/adjust.htm) and I
think this is the exploded view you need
(http://www.webernorthamerica_dot_com/pdffiles/32_36DFEV.pdf). If not,
there are a bunch of links off of the carburetion site. One of them
must be it. My brain and model/serial numbers just don't mix well.

The preheat that I am using is from the '72-'74 dual carb, courtesy of
Ken at theBusCo in Seattle (my tin was not stock '72). This routes the
warm air from the RHS right above the fuel pump through the front tin.
On top of the carb is a snorkel air filter (its called a &quot;Sprint&quot;) I
got online. There is no way to control flapper that routes warm or cold
into the top of the carb, so that gets to be another adventure, but
I've found it works pretty well. I've tried to come up with a
resolution for that, but nothing really good has come to mind. My last
thought was to tie it into the thermostat cabling in some way, but that
felt a little cludgey. So, on cold mornings I just run it with a lot of
warm air until it warms up (its running nice or I smell heat in the
vent), and then pull over, and kill the warm to a trickle.

Let me know if you want to see how it all fits together and we can find
some time. If a picture is worth a 1000 words, being there is worth
1000 pictures.

Good luck, and let me know if you want to see my engine for ideas.

&gt; If you've seen a white 74 lurching along Country Club or Kruse Way
&gt; you
&gt; will understand my interest in your air preheating solution.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning on keeping this on the road all year, but I'm getting 
&gt; the idea fast that it is unlikely unless I change to dual carbs.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen reference to electric intake manifold heaters in the UK.
&gt; I was thinking of getting my parents to send some over and see if 
&gt; they would make this thing drivable.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime I'll try to learn patience.
