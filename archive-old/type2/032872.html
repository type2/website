Subject: Junkyard adventures &amp; part swapping...

Went to my local pic-n-pull yesterday because I noticed they FINALLY had
some busses (four junkyards in the county, and not a single aircooled VW in
the lot till last week...) and I about ran down into the lot seeing what
they had. 

There was a Westy camper (not sure of year... plates were removed) about
74, burned up in the back end and also rolled over. Not sure which occurred
first. Luckily the driver or a passer-by had a fire extingusher handy and
so most of the damage was limited to the engine compartment. It has the
water tank I need as well as some odds and ends. I looked into the engine
compartment (the lid fell off and onto my foot... ouch) and lo-and-behold,
an electric fuel pump just like the one in my 72. The idea of a mechanical
pump is growing in my mind. 

Then I moved on to the second one... a 76 7-passenger in very nice
condition. Someone had stipped much of the front end out but the engine was
completely intact, down to a SOLID fan screen! I looked and the heat
exchangers I need are in good condition as well as the rest of the heating
system. 

So I talked to the &quot;master of the yards&quot; and he quoted me $5 for each of
the odds and ends including the rim I need for my spare, and $20 for both
heat exchangers and the boxes!!! So for those prices I'll pull the cables
etc as well. And he told me I could have the entire engine from the burned
one for $100 if it's not cracked etc and $50 if it is. 

So... what I need to know, is if the heat exchangers from that '76 will fit
my stock federal 72 exhausts? Also, what about the thermostat &amp; cable? I
can't judge well for myself since all I have left is the left heat exchanger. 

Thanks all.
