One more question that came to mind while I was looking at the parts for my 
exhaust: What are the implications of putting a Catalyst on a Federal Bus? 
One of the things my friends always chide me about is that I am a big 
environmentalist, but I drive this old polluting bus with low mpg. (I am 
working on the latter. I have improved it by 3.5 mpg since I got it, but I 
still have a long way to go. I see 13-15mpg right now which I know is low 
for this bus. I am pretty sure that most of this is wheel bearings which 
will be done Real Soon Now (tm)! )

  If I can put a Catalyst on my Federal bus I would do it to lower my 
emissions. Will this also lower my mpg? Any gotchas to watch for if I do this?

Thanks again. You people are the best!
-Nick
