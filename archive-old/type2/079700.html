Subject: Re: [T2] electrifiication

There are several good E-car lists out there if any of you want to read 
along and see how the pros accomplish the task. Even today it's a viable 
solution for a short range (under 50 miles) vehicle. Would serve me we well 
where we currently live.
:
&gt;I know the whole electrified bus thing is a bit of a pipe dream, but I know
&gt;a guy who's done it, and makes it work.  Does it work well enough?  Well
&gt;enough to use for his middle school tech class and do odd running around in
&gt;the meantime.  Good enough for me.
