   There must be something wrong with the archives, because this has
definitely been discussed at least a couple different times in the last
couple of years. Best solution is to cut the hose in half, get the
appropriately sized steel 90 degree elbow at a local muffler shop, put
it in the middle of the hose and glue and clamp it tight. Don't use
plastic, it'll melt.
      You can't just bend the hose, it'll kink -- I tried putting a
heavy spring the diameter of the hose inside like you see in some
radiator hoses -- it still kinked, although not as bad. But when I fill
up, I can only do so slowly. 
     You also should probably pull the tank when you do this, and make
sure the two rubber vent hoses are renewed as well, or the tank will
overflow all the time, creating a fire hazard. You can only replace the
far side if you pull the tank -- and getting the fill hose on is a major
PITA unless you pull the tank anyway.
