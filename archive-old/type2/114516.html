&lt;&lt; It is unnecessary to change the hypoid oil on a 1970 and later vehicle,

unless the oil has become contaminated or the temerature change makes it

necessary to use an oil of a different viscosity.

 &gt;&gt;

Not to throw a spaniard into the works, but define &quot;contaminated&quot;... ?-(
And, since this is an official VW reprint, does &quot;unnecessary&quot; define a
time period only covered by the original warranty, or beyond... ?-(
