Subject: Re: [T2] solenoid trouble

Ian,

Sounds like the electrical part of your ignition switch to me...standard 
problem for some bus owners.

See my rant about this around December of last year...&quot;cleaning electrical 
contacts&quot; and problems...

I promised to do the rant only once a year, so you don't get it this 
time&lt;grin&gt;.

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/139627.html

Also, pull every wire off of the starter, look at it and make sure that 
the spade lugs are good and the wires tothem are good...replace them 
anyway(the smaller one for sure).  Clean everythingto what it looked like 
when new....do the stuff in the archived post above.

Then start on the electrical part for the switch....plan on replacing it 
...probably easier than anything else.

Cheers, dave

 So the bus won't start all the time.  The problem is either the
 solenoid or the ignition.
 
 What I do to get it working is short the terminal on the solenoid from
 the battery and the terminal to the ignition - whirr goes the starter.
 I get back in and start her up.  I find it works ifm when I short it,
 I give it just a very short burst, so it's more of a  *clunk* than a
 whirr.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow I'm going to clean the ignition contact, but that's all I can
&gt; think to do.  So what's going on?  Why is this happening?  Is it the
&gt; solenoid or the ignition?  How can I check?  I've got my handy
&gt; multimeter and an iron will ready to do the work.   Suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Peace list,
