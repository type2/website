&gt; It works to get Jesus clips* out of electronics

Not being English or American I was not sure that our American instructor
was not pulling our leg when he told us about 'Jesus clips'. This was on a
training course on hard disks (Geneva, ca 1978). Back in those days you
could still repair them rather then throw them in the dust bin (they would
not fit in your average bin either).

I had not heard (or used) the expression since but you now have confirmed
that they really exist and I will start using the term whenever appropriate
(which may not be often as I suspect not everyone will appreciate the use of
this wording).

The other thing he mentioned were 'Big Anna screws'. Apperantly the factory
employed 'big Anna'. When she tightened screws they were inpossible to get
loose..... Again, I suspected that he made that one up himself but in any
case my buses have several of those !!!
