The cover plate over the upper slider has 2 screws...(it must be removed to 
remove the door)...if you have removed the screws it should come off, 
however, there is usually a plastic beading that runs along the top and it 
gets crusty and will sometimes &quot;freeze&quot; the cover to the bus...or...rust 
sometimes will &quot;weld' it to the body. Get some WD40 on, in, and around it an 
work it loose...unless someone has attached it some other way in the past.
 
When you finally get it off, there will be a &quot;notch&quot; in the middle of the 
runner...lift the door upward and pull out at the notch.

A good idea when you remove the door is to dissassemble the tracking 
mechanism, clean it up, lube it good and replace it...probably hasn't been 
done in awhile...
