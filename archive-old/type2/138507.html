Subject: help identify rear noise please...

Listees,

I have a noise coming from the rear and I can't figure out exactly what is 
is. I'm just going to list out random facts about the noise. This is on my 
daily driver 71 Westy.


-Noise is a sort of tapping, clicking noise from rear.

-Noise is intermitant, sometimes i don't hear it for a solid day or two and 
then it comes back.

-Sometimes noise is rather loud, sometimes it's barely audiable.

-Lots of times the noise goes away if you push in the clutch, sometimes it 
quiets it.

-Sometimes the clicking noise is present while driving in gear but you can 
only hear in 1st or 2nd cause of the engine/howling tranny.

-The noise is often synronized with the &quot;heartbeat&quot; of the speedo needle 
(only noticle at slow speeds)

-I can feel whatever it is by gently resting my hand on the shifter, the 
vibrations are going up through the linkage.

-Tranny howls like a coyote - I hope to put in a rebuilt one this winter, 
next spring.

-Noticed a torn CV boot the other day, want to replace all CV boots and pack 
CV joints ASAP, hopefully in a week.

Ok, so I'm thinking it's a clicking noisy worn out CV joint, but would that 
appear and disappear like this and account for all of those sympoms? Could I 
have 2 issues? Is there anyway if the clutch isn't adjusted properly it 
would account for any of this? Could this be somethng internal in the tranny 
be wrong?

Thanks in advance, hoping you guys/gals can point me in the right direction.
