Subject: RE: [T2] UPDATE - Buses By The Depot (this Saturday)

&gt; What time should we start showing up?


A few people are coming Friday night and more are staying Saturday night, so
I'd imagine there there will be some people there at any point on Saturday.
I'm probably going to shoot for around noon myself, I think. At some point
(perhaps in the mid afternoon) I guess those who are interested will be
taking a ride to the Bus Depot, so if you get to the campground in the
afternoon and we're not there, that's probably where we are. (The shop is on
Rt. 29, next to the Perkiomenville Auction; about a block north of Deep
Creek Road, which is the road that leads to the campground.)

Incidentally we're readying a section of blow-out merchandise
(scratch-and-dent, discontinued, one-of-a-kind, customer returns, order
cancellations, unsure of application, etc.) that will be sold below cost to
anyone who cares to pick through it and make a reasonable offer. We're
preparing to expand the shop and are discovering all kinds of miscellaneous
junk under the cobwebs (for Buses, Vanagons, and other VW models).
