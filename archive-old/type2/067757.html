A variety of lengths of 6mm x 1mm bolts and a tap for that size.  These 
are for the engine tin.  Nice to have a bunch around.

A &quot;Screw starter&quot; tool.  A common screwdriver with a center section 
that is on a spring that holds the screw on the end of the Screw 
Starter to allow one to easily start the screw.  Very useful for when 
replacing points and starting that small screw holding them on.

Extra windshield wipers would be nice.

Fancy shift knob.

&gt; How about useful uncommon tools?
&gt; Thanks for all of your thoughts,
