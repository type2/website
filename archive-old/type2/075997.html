&gt; It wasn't the type that you get from the rental store; this was a big
&gt; momma, trailer mounted with about 20 HP and a Diesel fueled water heater
&gt; that would crank out 3000PSI at 210 Degrees.
&gt; I cleaned out my CV pockets in the swing arms, all of my fender wells,
&gt; all of my front suspension and that always greasy rear area above the
&gt; muffler (where I dribble oil while adding 8oz.).

Now you can think about all the water that you forced into places that
water really isn't supposed to go.  3000PSI goes past rubber seals with no
problem at all, but how does the water (and soap?) get back out?
