Subject: Returning old heads for deposit

I am getting ready to return my old '77 2L head to Mark Stevens to get
my $85 core charge back.  How does one do this, I am shipping ignorant?
I realize they will charge me for damage to the head so I probably won't
see the whole $85.  How much will I see and is it worth it to pay the
shipping (NY to CA).  In other words I don't want to pay $30 to shipa and
have them only refund my $25.  If someone has gone through this procedure
please fill me in on exactly what you did.  Please include the obvious
parts.
Thanks for the info
brett
