I shoud be fixing the washer...but here I am..

You organic chemists just skim right by as to avoid being offended ;-)
hydrocarbons..dats fuel...un-burned....
*why* is it unburned??
Well...lots of reasons, Skippy...
Way too much going in? your float is doing the Leanardo DiCapiro thing? or the
needle valve is imitating the penstocks at the Hoover Dam?
Fuel pump took advice from Arnold and &quot;Pumped it *up*!&quot;
Choke (strangular valve)sticking? Time to do a Hiemlich on the carb?
I'd really need to know how the test is done....rollers? under load, idle
only?
But...hydrocarbons mean fuel is going down the tail pipe and *not* doing you
any good....and that is bad....(The little smogged-out birdies be damned..it's
my *money* we're talking here!)
You are going to have *some* un-burned fuel...knowing that the mixture at the
edges of the metal never get hot enough to burn (&quot;skin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; gasses)
The aircooled V-dub runs higher wall temps so I *should* be lower on these
counts  Things like the weak valve guides or rings that allow oil in the
mixture (oil = hydrocarbon) can cause a fail...
Improper mixture at the moment of firing due to poor chamber/manifold
design...always a little HC
A lean conditon will cause high HC....&quot;Huh?&quot;..well, Sunshine, if it's too weak
to set off with a spark, the cylinder mis-fires and all the gas goes out the
pipe!....
If the thing missfires the CO goes *way* down..that's the *other* # on the
form...
You get rid of Carbon Monoxide by making sure there is plenty of air..but the
engine needs a slightly *lower* amount of air to fire up with a spark so
always *some* CO...anyway, if the fire goes out..the HC goes up and the CO
goes away! &quot;Lean Misfire&quot;, it's called... 
If the CO and the HC are both high,it's flooding...way too rich...all the
normal flooding things above or puddling in a cold intake can cause this ...
There is a range where the HC is ok.and the CO can be varied by the mixture
strength...and then you may have CO2 and NOx tests...
Simple stuff made hard..
How about this.
Hydrocabons mean too much fuel is being unburned...mixture can be too lean or
too rich..look for things that would cause either
CO..too high? not enough air.if too low, check the HC...(missfire!)
NOx..high temperature! lean mixture, late timing high compression ratio..
Soooo if you lean it up and heat it up to clean up the HC and the CO, the NOx
goes through the roof.....gaaaaaaaa
Cool it down and the HC goes up...gaaaaaaa
Lean it to get rid of the CO and the HC goes up....gaaaaaaa
I suspect many emission engineers end up blubbering in the corner of a padded
cell somewhere.....
Remember the 009 story and how the timing had a feed-back device on the new
cars?
weeeeelllllllllll, there is more to the story....
Fuel systems now use Lambda probes (oxygen sensors) in the exhaust stream to
get an idea how the fuel system is copeing with the managment of the air and
fuel...
Too much oxygen in the exhaust? &quot;More GAS!&quot;...not enough oxygen? &quot;Enough!!
stop! *whoa*, UNCLE!......
(or the digital equvilant......)
Herr Maybach invented the Verrgasser back in 'ought something.....the fuel
system on your carburated bus is older than toast....
It happily sits perched on it's manifold, clogged solid or flushing 12 gal/min
of high test into the engine, either way going:&quot;Dum-dee-dum-dum&quot;..Stupid
beast, really...

carb rebuild..spend time checking the float for weigh and the number and
thickness of the fiber washers under the needle valve..thermostat...heat riser
tube not clogged?...aircleaner not overfull?
Timing spot on?
Yours is a 1.6 single carb, yes? ok...run it down to a 1/4 tank of fuel or
less...put in a few,..ok..6, cans of dry-gas (isopropyl)...timing right on or
a bit advanced...(retarded if an idle-only test)... engine *fully* warm (leave
it running right up to the time of test)
hot air to the aircleaner set to spec or set to cool air only (wet, cold day?
heat fully on for the aircleaner...get creative with wires and rubber bands)
And..make sure you changed the oil the day before.....
She'll pass......
I have reasons for all this voodoo...but you would get bored..
try it....
