Subject: fuel infection!



Hello Friends,
I've gotten a lot of help from a number of folks on the list getting my '78 Westy ambulatory again.
Thanks.

It was running well with a new AVP engine but some of my previous problems seem to have surfaced again.  Periotically, the FI system seems to go full rich (fuel dripping out of the exhaust system).  At that point of course it doesn't start.  I've checked the head temp. sensor and it seems good.  I've been told that if the resistance from the head sensor is high that the computer reads that as very low temperature and enriches the mixture and also activates the cold start valve/injector.  The last time it went full rich I grounded the lead to the head temp. sensor and that didn't help.  What does seem to help is unpluging the computer from the system.  Sometimes (at least) unpluging the computer for a period of time seems to put everything right.  I've been told that FI problems are almost never the computer but maybe this is the problem now.  The not-so-local VW dealer's service manager told me that if his work didn't keep it going (it didn't) that the computer was bad.  I was!
n't impressed with the VW dealer's work so I'm not sure if I should believe him.

I would love to find a known-good compter to try
to see if that is the problem. I'm in northwestern Pennsylvania.  If anyone has one that they would sell/lend I would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks in advance.

Drew
