Subject: Fw: [T2] wont idle cold

Do what you've got to do Ian. You obviously have no idea how corrosive it is
up here in the Rust Belt.  A new brass doorknob or mailbox loses it's finish
over the winter here, even those ones that are guaranteed to look new
forever. That's without the salt. Older VW's rotted out extremely rapidly
here even when new.

Some people need a reality check, if not, there aren't going to be many
buses left around soon, are there? The idling issue is extremely minor in
comparison. I think it's great if it won't run at all, it might last longer
that way.

So what your saying is that the salt on the raods up north is whats causing
it not to idle?


It is HIS bus no one else let him do with it as he likes.

I only drive aircool dubs and guess what that mean I drive all year
round&lt;shocked&gt;
