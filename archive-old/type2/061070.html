1. Has anyone had experience with the body repair panels sold by J.C.
Whitney?
    Can't say I do.  I myself would opt for a donor bus with the amount of
replacements you need.  The other thing does the whole panel need replaced?
You want to leave as much as the original bus metal as possible.  Hence patch
panels and sectioning are the way to go.
2. Does anyone know of a panel for the area under the motor hatch?  Should
I look for a donor bus &amp; cut out the whole section (inner &amp; outer panels) &amp;
weld them in?
    If you use a donor bus you'll be able to R&amp;I (remove and install) the
panels at the factory seams, this makes for a much nicer job.  It is also
quicker than lapping a section in.
. When I took the westy top off &amp; installed the penthouse, I was left
with holes in the roof panel over the front seats, do they have to be
welded up, or will one of the epoxy products work as a permenent repair?   
   I myself would go a head and weld them up, use a spray bottle of water or
compressed air to keep things cool, and take your time!  As for it being to
permanent a repair.  If you ever need holes--I hear drills are wonderful for
making them.
 4. Years ago I bought front window glass trim with new outside
weather-strip, ( the one that is supposed to stop water from running down
the glass &amp; into the door panel). It came with no instructions, &amp; the
service manual doesn't  go into much detail. They are still in their
packaging. Anyone know where I can get some detailed instructions?
      Okay, sorta detailed instructions.
        Remove the window crank, door handle bezel.
         Remove door panel.
          Remove vapor barrier (that plastic sheet)
           Roll down your window till you see the two 10 mm bolts on the
bottom of the
              window.  Undo these and let the window slide all the way down.
            Pull the channel felt weather stripping out ot the top of the
window opening. Don't
                loose the clips
              At the top of the wing vent in the channel where the weather
strip came out of 
                there will be a phillips screw--undo it.
                Now follow the vent wing pillar down into the down.  You'll
find a 10 mm bolt-
                    undo it.
              Tilt the vent wing back, and slide it out.  It get tricky-the
bracket at the end of
               the vent wing pillar is going to hang up.  When it does, rotate
the vent wing 
                90 degrees.  You'll be able to see all this in the slot where
the window used to
                be.
               On to the window scrapers, these can now be popped off with
ease, don't loose
                the little clips!
                Reinstall everything in the reverse order.  You may want to
use some foam 
                window cleaner to lubricate the wing vent, you might also what
to lubricate your
                window regulator while your in there.   Oh and one more thing,
don't forget your 
                 vapor barrier!
       
            Peace, Love, and it's a hell of a lot easier to do than explain!!
