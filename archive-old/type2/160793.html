&gt;Thanks for the advice. We're in Long Beach, though - so I'll just 
&gt;have to share pics with the group when we start to dig out the rust. 
&gt;None of it is TOO major.. the patch beneath the windshield concerns me, though.

No way to know what is required until you remove the windshied and 
seal. A fiberglass/epoxy repair will probably take care of the issue. 
Wait until in the dry desert to remove.
