&gt;Someone please provide a more precise definition/location of the part being

&gt; &gt;the long bracket that holds the Selector link had broken  .

This is an internal part, located inside the nose cone.
It is a bracket which supports the shifter selector shaft
components and is only available for inspection and repair
with the transmission removed. Photos in the Bentley.
