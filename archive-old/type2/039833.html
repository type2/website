Well, h_at_ll. I've got three other settings on my cute little multimeter
from Radio Shack: a little arrow, a K(omega), and CONT. I tried it on
all of them, and got a zero reading on each. Is that good news, or am I
doing something wrong?

Electricity baffles me. Can ya tell?

&gt; It doesn't mean much without knowing the milli-amp draw. 250-300ma means you
&gt; have a light on. This will drain a battery in a couple of days. A quartz
&gt; clock will draw 6 to 8 volts but only about 5ma.
