Subject: RE: [T2] fuel pump weirdness...

&gt;From: &quot;E. Marc Coe&quot; When I disconnected the brown (supposed to be red) line 
&gt;from the solenoid than runs current over the transmission and to the engine 
&gt;compartment, the fuel pump finally went &quot;cold&quot;.

&gt;But of course I need juice in that line to run the motor.  I re-connected 
&gt;it.  I disconnected the ignition coil completely - fuel pump still &quot;hot&quot;.

&gt;I disconnected the auxillary air regulator, the cold start valve and the 
&gt;thermo-time switch (I thought I might have connected them incorrectly) - 
&gt;fuel pump still &quot;hot&quot;.

&gt;Any ideas?  What thing in the engine should be &quot;hot&quot; all the time?


Sounds like your Double Relay may be faulty or your AFM is not closing all 
the way.
