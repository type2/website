Subject: Stupid VW-driver tricks or non-stock, not recommended, bad
  practices question... :-)

Volks,

OK... so we all know that VW put four fasteners between the engine and
trans for a reason.  Yup, I know that and, yup, I try very hard to get all
four in.  At the same time, I know from back in my days as an innnocent
(read: stupid), young (read: really stooopid!) teenager working on 60s
bugs that the upper left nut/bolt combo was a bear to install and it often
got &quot;forgotten&quot;. In addition, I know that if you had a stripped stud on
the bottom of the engine, you wanted it to be the one on the bottom left
(below the starter nut/bolt) and that by times we flopped studs so that we
could ran bugs (at least) with only the upper right and lower left
fasteners in place.  I also know that on bugs at least the upper right and
lower left was the irreducable minimum.  Upper and lower right or upper
and lower left just did not work (the engine swung to the side and the
clutch would not work).  I was not into buses back in those bad old days
and had no experience with the '68-71 models with engine bearer bars,
so....

I am wondering if anyone is brave enough to admit the minimum number of
fasteners that it takes to connect the engine and trans on a bus with the
bearer bar (in an emergency only (of course :-)).  I cannot imagine that
anyone has ever run a VW for very long without the upper right nut/bolt.
You *have* to have that or the starter will flex in the housing.  With the
rear bearer bar, tho.... I am thinking that that may be the irreducable
minimum! (with at least one stud in the case as a locator pin)  Anyone
actually had occasion to run like that?
