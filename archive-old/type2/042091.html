make sure that your vacuum advance is working correctly (if you have
one) - read my other reply to bucket titled &quot;re: dual vacuum fix&quot; to
test it.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; well put the finishing touches on lizzy's engine this
&gt; afternoonand fired her up.   started pretty easy and
&gt; let it run at a steady rpm for a while to get things
&gt; going.   when it came time for a quick trip around the
&gt; block, she felt a little sluggish.   she is running
&gt; fine, not smoking or backfiring, just sluggish
&gt; feeling.   i am going to give it a tuneup tomorrow as
&gt; my plugs, and wires are in need of replacement and it
&gt; might be just that.   valves are adjusted, timing is
&gt; on, etc.   is there anything else i am missing folks.
&gt;  if youve forgotten, i had the motor out to replace
&gt; pistons/ sleeves, AVP heads.   as a side note, went
&gt; downtown last night (old market in omaha) and saw 4
&gt; busses!!!   the most ive seen at one time in the state
&gt; of nebraska in 2 years, 2 westy's, a campmobile and a
&gt; sweet Devon camper.   cool night, wish i had mine.
&gt; have a good night.
