&gt; More than likely, the holes are not there until you cut them and

&gt; the seats you have are brown vinyl and they are in good shape
&gt; otherwise..... you can push in the plugs that take the place of the
&gt; headrests for the rear seats. I have a bunch of those plugs......

I wasn't sure about the holes in new covers. mine are pretty shot, but
I do have the plastic inserts from the rear seats I took out. good
idea I'll use those, but why did you ask about the vinyl being brown?
mine are black.
