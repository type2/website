&gt; I jumped each of my fuel injectors directly from the battery to see if they
&gt; had a nice atomizing spray, and if they worked at all.  I got a continuous
&gt; atomizing spray, and I was wondering if it should be an alternating spray (on
&gt; - 
&gt; off - on - off) rather than a continuous spray.  Also, is there anything else
&gt; I 
&gt; should be looking for to determine the condition of my injectors.

They pulse on and off but the pulse width is so small it appears to be
continuous. All injectors fire at the same time when the engine is running.
It's not obvious when you think about how the engine works but since
L-Jetronic doesn't have a way to find TDC when #1 fires it squirts a little
of the gas each time a cylinder fires.
