Subject: new thermostat needed, advice requested

Hello all,
I need to replace the thermostat in my '78 bus.  Having been underneath with that tin off and the engine cold, I said to myself &quot;Hmm, it shouldn't be fully expanded when the engine is cold, should it?&quot;  Then having seen the picture of a contracted thermostat in Tom Wilson's rebuilding book, I said &quot;No, it shouldn't be like that.&quot;

A lot of folks say &quot;screw the thermostat&quot; (this post is quotation mark friendly) but before anyone writes to me saying that, I want to say that I feel that leaving the thermostat out, while not completely stupid, isn't very smart and I don't need to have my mailbox filled up with BS like that.

So, I will buy and install a new thermostat.  What I'm concerned about is how the cable fits into the thermostat.  Does it thread in?  What exactly goes on there?  Is this a fairly easy procedure (looks like it is -- famous last words)?  Any advice will be appreciated.  Well, almost any advice ;)

Thanks,
Sean
