Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot brackets

Hoo-boy, good question. I don't know what they came out of but IIRC the
bars are not collapsible. They're going into the 73, though, and I'm pretty
sure the cot is out of something earlier, as were the rest of the interior
parts.

So it sounds like what you're saying is I should probably not go with a
point to point measurement (which would vary from year to year) but should
gauge where to put the brackets by the relationship of where the horizontal
poles meet the vertical pillars and hope for the best.

&gt;[that's why 68 to 73 bars are 56 1/4'' and 74/75 are 57 1/4''.....76 to 79

&gt;&gt; Could someone give me the measurements for installing the child's cot
&gt;&gt; brackets in the A &amp; B pillars? Scott was nice enough to include one in the
&gt;&gt; interior he sold me, and I'd like install it in Wendelin for 9-y/o Lauren
&gt;&gt; for when we go camping (and temporary storage when she outgrows it).
