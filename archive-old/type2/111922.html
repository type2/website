Subject: Dead Cylinder

Hey All,

I've run into a bit of an inconvenience with my VW. 
One of the spark plugs has ejected itself from the
head...again.  Probably the 3rd time it's happened,
twice since I've owned it.  Heli-coils did the trickat
first, but obviously it's not a permanent solution and
I'm afraid after retapping the head and using the
coils so many times, may mean i need to replace the
head altogether.  The problem is i don't have the time
or money to do this right now.  Are there any major
reprecussions that I will face if I run it on only 3
cylinders for a week or so (apart from the obvious
lack of power)?  Thanks for your input guys.

Peace, Love, &amp; Happiness!!!
