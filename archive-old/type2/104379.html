Subject: Anybody need cheap speakers?

I'm a cheapskate and like cheap prices...

www.partexpress_dot_com $2 a speaker in some cases.

I have no connection with them but I know those speakers fit well in our 
busses. I was previously a customer on several occasions.

I figure somebody will rake me over the coals for this but is this any 
different than reminding the list that there is a sale at Bus Depot?

Hope somebody finds it useful.
