Subject: Re: [T2] Lower Ball Joints!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; Now, I thought pressing on and off ball joints, at least on older
&gt; cars, was a common enough event; what the *heck* makes the Vanagon
&gt; lower ball joints so difficult, if anything?

There is not much space around the metal part of the joint to set it in a
press.  You basically have to make a part to hold it in the press that you
will probably never use again.  When I did my joints I took them to about 5
different machine shops and none of them could do it.  I ended up creating a
very fandangled press/puller type contraption that, combined with a ton of
heat, managed to get them in.
