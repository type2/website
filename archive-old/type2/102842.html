&gt;This week my wife took an interest in an '85 Vanagon for sale down the
&gt;street so we went to take a look at it today.  I realize there is a
&gt;Vanagon list but I'm sure there are at least a couple of you on this
&gt;list that can help me decide whether or not to jump into this purchase
&gt;having never owned a water cooled VW (or even a Type 4 engine).
&gt;
&gt;Here's what we have - a currently registered California (no rust) 7
&gt;passenger Vanagon that is pretty clean, inside and out, for $1300.  It
&gt;is generally drivable with good brakes and decent tires.  Performance
&gt;seems good but there's 2 things I just don't know about.  The valves on
&gt;both sides are very loud to my ear and the idle has a strange cycle
&gt;where it speeds up and slows down about every 5 seconds or so.

This means something is wrong. It could be just out of adjustment or it may 
need several hundred dollars of parts to correct.

&gt;   Since
&gt;I'm in California I've reminded the owner that she is responsible for
&gt;smogging the vehicle and I've agreed to pay for an inspection by a local
&gt;VW mechanic to determine what the issues are.

That's a good idea. Be sure he does a compression test and looks over the 
whole cooling system for possible problems. Wrong coolant??? Any coorosion 
on the head seals/water pump or any of the hose fittings??? Have $4000+ 
ready for a new motor.

&gt;  I'm wondering, is this
&gt;vehicle, given its overall condition, worth the price in spite of what
&gt;might be found.

If they gave it to you for nothing, it still might not be a bargain. Add 
$2000 for a clutch and tranny to that motor and see what I mean?? How about 
$600 for CV's?? Check the brake fluid reservoir. Black and ugly?? Add 
another $600

&gt;And, what are the possible causes and solutions of the
&gt;valve noise and idle fluctuations.

Valve noise could be 1)wrong weight oil, 2) non-stock oil filter, 3) bad 
lifters, 4)rockers not properly adjusted.
