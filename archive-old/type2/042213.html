I'll be leaving Thursday evening to drive back to the Bus Pilots Reunion
with my 10 year old daughter Katelyn, anybody else going to this event? If
you happen to see us on I-80 we'll be driving a White 68 DC loaded with
Squareback parts to swap in Idaho and at the BugCraft swap in Ogden Utah
give us a wave! By the way the DC is for sale $3500.00. Thanks,
Britt
