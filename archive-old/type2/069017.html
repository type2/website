Subject: Top 10 Tools

Top ten on my VW tool list:

   1. Slotted Screwdriver
   2. Metric End Wrenches
   3. Phillips Screwcriver
   4. Socket/Ratchet Set
   5. Linesman's Pliers
   6. Flashlight
   7. Hammer
   8. Knife
   9. Floor Jack
  10. Jackstands

   ... NO I don't carry a floor jack around, but if I could have
  only 10 kinds of tools that would be one of them.

      Drive on,

      Chris
