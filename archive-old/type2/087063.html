high altitude???  on the East Coast...isn't that an oxymoron

personally I live in the big city and drive my van all the time, I'm up
high and can see over traffic, and the bus is far more manuverable than my
wifes S*turn.   IMO  I would get ride of the other set of wheels and keep
my van.

&gt; so, i thought i might as everyone's honest opinion of
&gt; the value of my bus. i didn't pay a dime to get the
&gt; title, but i have put $7000 into it. here is a list of
&gt; things done and things needed.

you will never get that much back, lucky to get half

&gt; i love this bus and it drives awesome. i did all of
&gt; the work for my year long cross-country trip and soon
&gt; i will have to relinquish him to another loving owner.
&gt; he still has lots of life in him and just want to make
&gt; sure that price that i ask for is reasonable.

you'll be sorry you let it go....

glad your' back on the road again

BTW, you can now get small cracks and chips in glass repaired and a
windshield really isn't that expensive considering the other repairs you
have made
