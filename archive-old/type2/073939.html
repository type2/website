Subject: The Ex-Westy

Well, for those of you interested, I DID successfully remove the camper work
for my Bus. I also lost my domain for a few days, so my question about
sunroof size being a match did not get any attention from me.   Let me just
say this for anyone interested:

Yes, the hole for the pop-top and the roof are the same.  Yes, you would
have to do some work for drainage, though with a little creative work, you
can easily just channel water down to the sides of the roof.  The trouble
for me came from the doner bus.  Sure, this '75 had a sunroof...  but after
getting the headliner down I discovered it would not open because it was
caulked closed.  It appears that the PO had stripped out the worm gear
(confirmed later) and just caulked it closed rather than fixing it. Well,
after I forced the roof open, I decided that although it would be a lot of
work to actually transplant the roof to the other car, it would make an
ideally sized part to fill in the hole.  So, we raised it into place (after
stripping all edges to bare metal) and tacked it in.  We used some 1/4&quot;
steel to fill in the gap, and my friend ( a good welder ) ran a nice even
bead around the whole thing.  A little help from my 4&quot; grinder and the roof
was in at least as good of condition as before I even touched it.  I have
been forced to use a little plastic body filler on it, but less than
credit-card thin to just get the countours right.  Still working it down to
smooth, but at least it is sealed from the weather now.  I am bringing the
Version3 website back online this week, and will re-open the T2 section this
weekend.  I'll have all of the details and some pictures there for anyone
interested.

Thanks for all of the advice on the roof Volks!
