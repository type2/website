Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Replacing battery tray

I have not done this personally but have talked to a handful of folks that have used autobody specific epoxies with great satisfaction. One pro claims he couldn't pull them apart if it had to. Makes me want to take the chance with this stuff... I'd try it on battery trays and rocker panels anyhow... 

I would independently find instruction if I was you (I am NOT a knowledgable source) but I would expect you leave a lip of the old tray intact - maybe 1/2 or 3/4&quot; around the perimeter and then use a small grinder/sander to remove any rust from this. Remove primer from edge of new tray, cut to size, and glue in. Finish with seam sealer. 

This would be the same procedure for fiberglass (which always comes loose or cracks and holds moisture or water in my experience) or pop-rivets. Pop-rivets I have had good success with for non-structural repairs like a battery trays but it is ugly and obvious. Just depends on your skill, goals and available tools. Don't forget to seal the tray with a good primer and paint. 

I will in the future try the epoxy repairs on anything non-structural for myself.. 

Chris
