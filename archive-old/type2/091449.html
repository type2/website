&gt; A small oil leak that does not effect between
changes would not seem like a problem to me, all my
VW's are like puppies, they mark their spot. If you
can't stand it, clean the bottom of the engine real
good, start it up crawl under and look for where it's
coming from, most likley coming from your main oil
seal which would require a engine pull to fix, but
don't rule out, oil sender - push rod tubes - oil
cooler - oil breather. If all fails put a drip pan
under it. Have fun Phil
