Hello, just got on here and have been lurking....I have two vans....one
is a '74 station wagon (7 passenger bus) and the other is a '75
Westy...currently changing out the transaxle on the '75...it's a daily
driver.  But I going to need some help. I dropped the old transaxle on
my left hand and now have a very swollen and sore hand (and two
stitches).  Anybody in the Beaumont, TX area wanna help?  I also have a
'70 Bug that I'm fixing up for my son.  Thanks and I certainly do enjoy
visiting here.
