Subject: Canvas &quot;thread&quot;



&gt;I am very happy with the tent I bought from The Bus Depot.  Heavy canvas
&gt;and three windows.

Sorry, I just caught a murmur of this thread:

Are you folks talking about tents, as in add-ons, or did someone discuss
replacement pop-top canvas?

I would be very interested in sources of the 3-window type pop-tops, as my
'79 came with a one window, and it needs replacing soon.  Ideas, sources?

Roger
