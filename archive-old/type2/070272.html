Hi Terry -  you wrote:

That's what my wife is saying about her MacIIsi, cause there doesn't seem to
be much available for it to support her Internet addiction.&quot;

======
A bit off topic of VWs, but I am not sure I understand ;you wife's concern
regarding a IIsi.  Is it limitations of the machine itself, or s/w or what?

This has turned into a thread with a life of its own, removed completely from
the VW content to which it was originally attached, sorry about that Volks
(there now there is some content).  In answer, the MacIIsi is a wimpy machine
incapable of supporting advanced functions like video or free-tel, has only an
80Mb hard drive that is at 90% of capacity, and only 8 Mb of RAM, so it looks
like I am going to start piecing together a PC for her for Christmas, even
though I like my Mac PowerPC, I just can't afford one for home.
