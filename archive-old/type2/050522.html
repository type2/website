You might try a search for &quot;Barry Controls&quot;. Manufacturers of many
excellent vibration isolation systems. Another source might be a
cooperative NAPA counterperson.  They have photo catalogs of their
'motor mounts' that may illustrate something suitable.

&gt; &gt; I ripped one of the bushings right off.  It doesn't bother me much, but
&gt; &gt; I would like to know what will happen in the summer when I zip tie the
&gt; &gt; pump to the frame.  Is there any reason I should attempt to find a new
&gt; &gt; rubber mounting dohicky, or was that just the germans being their normal
&gt; &gt; silly selves?
&gt; 
&gt; IF you find a source for new ones let me know, I have been looking for
&gt; years, my fuel pump is held on with hose clamps but I have scarfed those
&gt; bushings whenever I could find em, but 20+ year old ones don't like being
&gt; yanked off in junque yards, and rarely survive the removal installation
&gt; process for very long
