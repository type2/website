I think the t-stat is a vastly underappreciated part of the temperature
control system, and all these folks driving around without one are probably
doing themselves a disservice. John Muir talks about how the most wear
happens on a cold engine. Of course, oil is thick and drained away,
clearances are largest. Driving away with a cold engine has to make a
difference on expected life of these motors. Since I installed mine warmup
time is a fraction of what it used to be, and so I believe will be the wear.
The CHT gauge shows normal operating temps regardless of outside
temperature, around 300F
The type 4 is expensive so put in a type one. They work.

The tin beneath the pushrods needs to be there. But wide open flaps allows
maximum cooling when the engine don't need it.
