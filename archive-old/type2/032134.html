&gt; &gt;Yes, you just totally screwed up.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm. I told him he was fine. One of us is way wrong. It is almost
&gt; certainly me, Ian. This is an easy experiment to prove, just go point the
&gt; rotor at #1 and do the thing right. Then point the rotor at #3 and check
&gt; the clearance on #1 because I would like to know the empirical answer to
&gt; this.

	Shortly after posting, I decided that eight hours in a parking lot
at 50 deg ambient was cool enough for me to go poking about and see if I
really had screwed up. Admittedly I did not check the wiring, but with the
rotor itself on the #1 firing mark and the timing mark set to 0 deg, Al's
postulation was entirely correct - both intake and exhaust for #1 were
PLENTY loose, somewhere in the neighborhood of .02&quot; (as compared to
.006&quot;). To answer Ken, I can say that provided the bus' previous owner
hadn't set the valves too tight, valve clearance for #1 when the rotor is
set at #3 is abysmally small - tighter than .0015&quot; (the smallest I checked
when resetting them incorrectly the first time and thinking, &quot;Gosh, that's
tight, but I guess everyone says these things are never done right
anyway.&quot;). 
	When starting up after making them real loose the first time, the
bus roared to life and ran a lot louder. Not just loud valve clicking, but
louder in general. Start-up times in the morning were cut to nothing;  I
could feel the initial squirt of fuel from the automatic choke Muir hates
so much. It was so energetic I figured I'd done something right.  After
resetting again last night, it's back to its mellow self. So: how should
we expect a type IV to run with real loose valves? More air in the mix? 

	Thanks to Al, Ken, and all, 

Ian
