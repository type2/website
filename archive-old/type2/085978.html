Subject: Propane Tank

Greetings:

Anyone know a source for those external 2.5 gallon propane tanks?

I had one on my '70 Hightop Campmobile.  It was very handy.  I thought maybe 
some RV supply centers might carry them but have had no luck finding a 
source in a recent search.

I can also remember the attendant in AZ not wanting to fill the tank the 
last time I had propane put in it.  He said it was over some age limit and I 
could not verify that it had been inspected.  He reluctantly filled it but 
said he was not supposed too....

&gt;I picked up a nice original propane tank over the weekend. I am not sure 
&gt;how
&gt;to install it though. Can someone tell me how these tanks were attached
&gt;under their bus?

&gt;
&gt;I don't want to use it for anything inside the bus like a stove, etc, Its
&gt;going to be used just for external use when camping.
