Subject: Type 2 Cinema

I believe that one of the conversions available for Type 2's was a van that
could be expanded(?) to show movies or at least public
information/instruction films.

I have looked through my various books and never been able to find out
details of this conversion apart from the fact that it existed. Does anyone
have any pictures of such a van on-line ? or better still a drawing ? or is
able to tell me of a book with these in ?

At the moment the most I am likely to do is make a model of one, bit who
knows perhaps someone might consider building the real thing. How about that
for an unusual project !
