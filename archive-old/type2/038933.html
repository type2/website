&gt; &gt; Vacuum in your fan shroud???  No, maybe a 'low pressure area' but not
&gt; &gt; vacuum.
&gt;
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; Low pressure???  Isn't the purpose of the fan to pull air (generating a
less
&gt; than atmospheric condition = vacuum) and exhaust that air for cooling?

The fan displaces air, it does not create vacuum. The air the fan moves
comes from the front of the shroud, outside of the shroud.
