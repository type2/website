Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

Just go to the junkyard and look for 80's vintage Japanese cars. They often 
had a key lock on them that would be easy to retrofit.

As for the locking gas cap - beware the common brands (mine is a Stan?) use 
keys that are often interchangeable. Basically one key fits many gas caps. 
Not very secure.

Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. Actually
&gt;it appears that a locking gas cap can't be made for this type of filler.
&gt;
&gt;This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock for the
&gt;filler door?
