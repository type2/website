&gt; When I am changing oil, I fill the new filter with fresh oil which takes
&gt; care of getting oil on the seal and the threads! The filter usually takes
&gt; about .5 quart which I deduct from the 3.7 quarts that goes into the
&gt; crankcase. This is how I was taught to do it many years ago and I have
&gt; always done it since. Supposed to be better for the engine when you start up
&gt; after the oil change. Any opinions?

An excellent idea, if the filter is installed open-end-up.  If installing
a remote filter, be sure to orient it this way!
