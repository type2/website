Subject: space heater

Thanks for the warning Mike. I am somewhat concerned about that. My 
idea is that by putting the heater beneath the overhang when the rear 
set is folded down, nothing will be able to fall directly on it. Also, 
this model has a safety feature that will shut it down if the vents 
become blocked.

However, a pillow or blanket might fall directly in front of the heater 
into the stream of hot air, and I suppose this could become a problem. 
This worries me a bit-- maybe install a smoke detector? Perhaps just 
velcro one toward the front of the pop top.

Rob
