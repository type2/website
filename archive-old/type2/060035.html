&gt; I found a junk yard within driving distance that will allow me to
pull a BA6

make
&gt; sure all the parts are complete.
&gt; 
&gt; Does $200 sound about right?  Anyone have a NOS one?

At that price, I'd want to see it run _before_ you pull it.  If it's
in good condition the extra bucks might be better than reviving a dead
heater.  If it isn't in good running condition then I'd say that the
price was too high.  

One advantage of pulling it yourself is that you can see where the
holes are punched and how the fuel lines and wiring goes (take along a
sketch pad, tape measure, etc. to document this) and you also can see
how it all goes together.  You'll also get all the little bits and
pieces that tend to get lost.
