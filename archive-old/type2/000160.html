Subject: Bringing it all back (My philosophy) the end. I hope!!

I have been to school in Germany for Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi.  And will 
be finishing my schooling upon my return this year.  We were even taught in 
school to be prepared and I remember quite well the fact that many of these 
cars came from the factory with a very small collection of spare parts.  This 
was to avoid the inevitable.  We still preach the method of better safe than 
sorry.  This motto can be edited and adjusted depending on ones skills and 
abilities.  But please remember the bus has adequate storage for my survival 
list of supplies.  And can be taken or left at home depending on the length 
and nature of your journeys.
1. Extra fan belt
2. extra points
3. Some oil
4. basic tools
5. Manual(chilton , etc.)
6.  1-2ft fuel line
all these parts are rather inexpensive and relatively speaking can cost much 
less than a single tow or road side assistance.  I dot care how long or how 
good a mechanic one is but it ($tuff) happens and to be prepared is better 
than to be told (I told you so).  But I do agree proper maintenance is a 
must, but should never be mistaken for a guaranteed safe trip in any make of 
vehicle.
Peace Out
