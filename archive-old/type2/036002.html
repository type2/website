	Mark,
	Yep, we've ALL got answers :) YOU have to decide which 
to accept!

	Think it around one more time. You're creating a 'low pressure'
region in the pump AND in the collection jar. That low pressure draws
fluid, and as Herr Doktor Professor Tim points out, air around the
threads, into the collection jar. Where does this fluid come from?
The fluid comes from the master cylinder resevior AND FLOWS AROUND
THE SEALS. 
	WHAT!?!?!?!
	Yep, the master cylinder seals are 'directional' they resist
fluid flowing back when you push down, but freely allow fresh fluid
come pass when the pedal is coming up. The seals are little cups, not
little o-rings.

	So you're going to need some moderately low pressure. I've DONE
this with my friend Kevin on his GMC pickup, using my own marshmallow
creme jar bleeder reviviors. Yes, some air comes around the
threads, so if you really do this solo, you'll be pumping the pump
with one hand and wrenching on the nipple with the other hand. A tough 
little hand pump is about right for such a job. I'd be real skeptical 
of a drill-powered pump...

	The advantage, particularly on an old bus with a master cylinder you
didn't install and after who knows how many years, is that the vaccuum
method may allow you to purge the system without tearing the aforementioned
master-cylinder seals. Since the master cylinder doesn't get pumped
at all, the fluid just gets sucked past it.

	The alternative, working alone or with a friend, is to crack the
bleeder open and then pump the pedal. Pump all the way to the bottom
and you've taken the seals into territory they seldome visit, where crud
lurks that will tear the edges. A couple robust stomps and the old but
not-leaking master cylinder becomes an old and leaking master cylinder.
Ask me how I know. :)

	If the cylinder is new and you flush and bleed regularly, this isn't
so much a problem as the crud doesn't build up along the master cylinder
bore in the areas seldom visited...

	SO if you can afford the vaccuum pump, or a pressure bleeder which
PUSHES the fluid through from the master cylinder end, you've done
a good deed. If you use the 'Arm Strong' method of pumping the master
cylinder, pump gently or start with a new one :)

	I've done more solo bleeds than I care to count, pumping the pedal
by hand from above with the bleeder just opened and connected to my
elaborate catch jar (which isn't any better, really, than a jar and a 
length of hose, but feels nicer to me) They're good bleeds and I don't
leave any air. But on newly acquired used cars, I've replaced one master 
cylinder two days later, and just swapped the one in our '70 before I 
even began. You don't have to buy too many master cylinders to pay for a 
nice vaccuum pump. :)

	Bill
