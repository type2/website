Subject: removal of smog equipment on a 1973 bus (part 1)

After searching the list prior to doing this, I thought I would take a
moment and post some clarifications for the next person who
contemplates doing this.  No, you don't have to drop the engine or even
remove the dual carbs...  Just work slowly and carefully and you can do
it with carbs in place.

Various parts have various names, depending on the source.  In my
documentation, I've labeled these parts according to the illustration
at www_dot_bus-boys_dot_com/emission6874_dot_htm 

1) disconnect the hoses leading to and from the smog pump and the
pressure relief valve (the vertical chamber to the right of the smog
pump).
2) unbolt and remove the smog pump and pressure relief valve.
3) pull out the entire air cleaner assembly.
4) remove the single screw the holds the exhaust port and manifold
vacuum pipes to the air cleaner stand.
5) remove the four screws that fasten the air cleaner stand to the tin
and pull out the air cleaner stand (which is actually two pieces).
6) remove the mixture distribution assembly (looks like an open-topped
&quot;4&quot; when held at a certain angle).
7) slide under the bus and unbold the EGR pipe from the EGR filter.
8) unbolt the both ends of the EGR pipe from the right and left
manifolds then slide it away from the manifolds, toward/into the hole
in the firewall.
9) disconnect and remove the solenoids from the outside of left carb
(it gives you a little bit more room and prevents accidental damage to
them). 

10) with a 19 mm wrench, unscrew each of the four flare nuts that hold
the air injection tube assembly (looks like a short, wide &quot;H&quot;)to each
cylinder.
11) to remove this start at the right carb, angling, rotating and
pulling it up and toward the front of the bus... taking care to protect
the left carb as the piece is rotated and shifted.  Once clear of the
right carb, angle and rotate the piece up and toward rear of the left
carb.  The piece will come out without being damaged or altered and
without the removal of the carbs... just be patient.
12) now seal the exposed flanges with four &quot;3/8 inch FEMALE PIPE CAPS&quot; 
(not compression caps, not flare nuts, not flare plugs, and not bolts,
no matter what the nice folks with '74 busses say works for them).  The
threads on the &quot;3/8 inch FEMALE PIPE CAPS&quot; will fit the now exposed
flanges on a '73 bus exactly, and can be applied with the same 19 mm
with which you previously removed the air injection tube assembly nuts.
 A little RTV on the lower threads and at the base is not a bad idea to
keep dirt and contaminants out, isn't a bad idea.


okay... that's I far as I got.  After conferring with the list and
verifying what works, I'll post how I reconnect the parts and tubes
that are no remain.
