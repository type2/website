In my experience there should not be much, if any, drag if the rotors were
turned. Even with brand new (thicker) rotors and pads you might have just a
slight bit of drag until the pads are bedded in, but usually the wheels will
turn free with just a rubbing sound, but no heavy drag. With the wheel
attached and jacked, you should be able to spin the wheel a revolution or 2
with a good push.

You mention that the caliper throat was hanging up on the rotor itself,
perhaps the caliper is rusty and the throat has become smaller with
encrustation of rust.
