Subject: RE: [T2] Dirty fuel filter = loss of power?

&gt; An interesting test would have been to put the gauge on with the bad filter&gt;
and see the pressure loss.

Hey - how often do you have to change them out? Late last year I bit the
bullet and &quot;restored&quot; my gas take with that handy Por 15 kit and I think they
job was worth it. It helps to have a 2nd take to fix up so you can just swap
out next time the engine is out.
