&gt; The &quot;bolt&quot; is on the outside of the door. It's round, but has either

&gt; No WAY can any of my tools reach in their to grab ahold of whatever it

&gt; So what is the propper way of removing the Drivers Side Door Rear View
&gt; Mirror on a 76 bus?

from memory if I'm wrong I'm sure someone will correct me,

 I seem to recall that the &quot;thing&quot; on the outside is more a locking nut
than anything, screw the new mirror in then hold mirror and turn &quot;thing&quot;
on the outside until it locks everything in place....
