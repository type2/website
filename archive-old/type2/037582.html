Subject: Ebenspacher BN4 for sale

Hey y'all
The Burrito Express has an Ebenspacher BN4 in it.  I've given this lots
of thought and have decided that although it's in really good condition,
I need the space it occupies more than I need the heater.  It appears to
be in excellent condition.  No, I haven't lit it up to try it out
because it's still in the bus and I would want to remove it before I
tried it.

First $250 gets it shipped to you.

I also have a tri-power fridge, runs on 120, 12, and propane if anyone's
interested.  I plugged it in and it makes cold, not real fast but it
does work.  Make offer.

Dave
