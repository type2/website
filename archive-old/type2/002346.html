&gt; The main wiring harness in my project '74 Westy is in dire need of
&gt; replacement.  But the closest I can find in catalogs is for a '72.  Does
&gt; anyone have any experience in modifying the '72 harness?  Or are there any
&gt; other alternatives?  The bus has a non-FI 1.8L.

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Darren.

That's right, the aftermarket wiring specialists (like Wiring Works in San
Pedro Ca.) only make them for the earlier years.

Find a salvage yard that has a good used one you can pull.  Check with:
www.interstatevw_dot_com their in Lakeside, Ca.
