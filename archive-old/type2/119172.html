Subject: Re: [T2] Busses &amp; Breakfast Burritos

Duane,
Breakfast burritos were introduced to the Full Moon Bus Club by Mad Uncle
Dave in 99 and we have spread them on to bus campouts all over the country.

Basically
You start with a tortilla shell (soft)
and add the breakfast ingredients you like.
traditional ingredients include:
salsa, shredded cheese, eggs, bacon,sausage, chorizo, onions, peppers,sour
cream.
Some non traditional ingredients:
elk, tofu, tempeh, turkey, seafood

What FMBC does is, members (Moonies) bring one or two ingredients each, we
cook communally and throw all our food together and the burritos just seem
to turn out delicious :))

Check out the Ohio Valley Tribe
http://autos.groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/ohiovalleytribe/ a regional clan in your
area of the FMBC, as they cook up great burritos...

Bus Content: Breakfast burritos make happy, full bus campers.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
