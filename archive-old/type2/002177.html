What year of bus??
    I like to also grease where the bale slides over the valve cover.  I
also use the Muir method of using a 15mm wrench to pry up the bale while i
push it into place with the 14mm or 16mm.  The larger heater boxes make this
a bear on my 78, but My valve covers don't come off every 3000 miles (thank
you Mr. Hydralic Lifters!!).  Patience and a like for grease help make this
task a little easier..

&gt; Make sure the metal lip in the valve cover is clean and smooth, also the
&gt; flat surface on the head.
&gt; I put a thin coat of gasket  cement on the valve cover to keep the
&gt; gasket in place while tipping into place over the head.  It takes a
&gt; certain &quot;feel&quot; to know the cover is centered over the edges of the
&gt; head.  Because the heater box sticks out so far, it's more difficult- I
&gt; do 2 tricks to get the cover wire snapped up without displacing the
&gt; cover- 1. Grease the area on the cover where the wire rubs. 2. wedge a
&gt; piece of wood strapping between the top of the cover and the engine so
&gt; the cover won't ride up as you help it up with something like a brake
&gt; adjustor.   MB
