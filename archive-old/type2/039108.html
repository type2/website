&gt;This weekend I tried to tackle my drivers door lock, with little success.

&gt;The problem is that I cannot unlock the drivers door from the outside.
&gt;(I have to climb in from the passenger side.)  
&gt;
&gt;However, if the door is open, the key will flip the little lever (this is a
&gt;1970 bus)
&gt;from open to locked and back again - perfectly and easily.
&gt;
&gt;Shut the door again, and it won't work !   (It's just possible to lock it,
&gt;but unlocking 
&gt;is definitely no-go.  I don't want to break the key off !!!)
&gt;
&gt;Is there some adjustment I can make ?

Howard, if lubrication of the key slot and the wear points of the mechanism
inside don't resolve it, buy a new lock cylinder. Take the old cylinder and
new cylinder to a locksmith who can rekey the new one with new plungers to
fit your existing key. Or just have two keys. Also, adjust the latch peg if
misalingment is creating the bind when closed. Are those hinges sagging a
bit??

How much wear on your keys? Avoid the soft brass key blanks typical of
harware stores. Get the much harder VW blanks if available at the dealers,
which can destroy the hardware store cutters. 

Know that Brazillian and Mexican cylinders are typically what is available.
They cost danged near as much as the formerly available German ones but are
vastly inferior. Some I've seen are not reasonably functional out of the
box, where in one or both of the new keys provided do not work, period. If
that is all you can find, test it at the counter BEFORE you pay for it.
