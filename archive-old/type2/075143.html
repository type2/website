&gt; Do you understand how multigrade oil works? A 10W40 has a 10W oil base.
That
&gt; is enough for about 2 minutes, till the engine warms up a bit. Then, long
&gt; chain polymers in the oil open up, creating an apparent viscosity increase
&gt; which approaches 40 at operating temperatures. I'd never run my van with
10W
&gt; or 20W oil only in it, like it says in the manual. Bob uses 5W50
synthetic,
&gt; I think this would be a good way to go, year round. Tom
&gt;
&gt;


Well, I thought I did. Guess I'll have to check out the sites again. Can
anybody provide the URL for the great oil information pages?

Dave.
