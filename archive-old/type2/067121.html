Here I am to save the day!  Wait, that's Mighty Mouse's sig line.

&gt; Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me locate 
&gt; you on a map!)
California, Grass Valley 1/2 way between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe

&gt; What is you van: year, model
&gt; What is the name of your van:
'80 Westi   &quot;The Bus&quot;
'80 Westi (yes, a second one, currently a parts bus, but roles may 
switch between busses) &quot;The Old Bus&quot;
'87 Subaru  &quot;The Car&quot;

&gt; What is your name:
Jeff Carver

&gt; What is the URL for your home page: (if you have some)
sigh, none
 
&gt; Do you think I can answer how old are you?? Or it's not appropriate?? :-O 
Go ahead and try, but anything other than 40 would be wrong!
 
&gt; And give me your suggestion!!
Good repair/parts place nearby in Auburn on Interstate 80, Vallero's
(great Thai food in Auburn at David's also)
We're so far off the beaten path that relatives don't visit!
Lots of room for lost VW friends and those in need.

Grass Valley, California, USA, Earth
I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
