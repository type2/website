Subject: Re: [T2] Any experience or thoughts with the CB filter?  

Are you happy with it's performance?  Worth the
cost and hassle?  

Thanks,
Ray
 
&gt; I have the little sump. I found it on a Ghia
&gt; engine at the wrecking yard. It was empty when
&gt; I remove it. 

Hmmm.  Probably didn't work well like that.  

&gt; Kind of false advertising calling it a
&gt; &quot;Lifetime Hi-Flo Filter&quot; when you have to buy
&gt; replacements!!

I saw that.  Is the lifetime filter supposed to
be cleaned like a K&amp;N?  10.00 is pretty steep if
I'm changing it everytime I change the oil,
oraround 2500 miles on a 1600.
