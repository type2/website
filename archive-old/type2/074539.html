Hey,

I am new to the list. My name is Tom.

I have owned 2 type 2s. A 1974 bus with
manual trans and a 1989 Vanagon with
and automatic. Both of these were straight
up passenger movers.

I have my eye on a 1978 Westy. Auto Trans,
124,000 miles, a bit of surface rust and a 
couple of small holes in the fiberglass camper 
top that look like they can be patched.

I can pick it up for $1,200. It sounds like a
deal to me. Any advice will be greatly 
appreciated.

Tom O. 

PS, it already has Greatful Dead stickers in 
the windows and a &quot;Heyduke Lives&quot; bumper 
sticker. So I have that goin for me...which is nice.
