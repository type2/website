Extra's I carry in my 71 Westy

floor jack
scissors jack
pulley belt
CV joint
wires
carb cleaner
lots o tools
clutch cable clip
cap, rotor, plugs, points
spare electric wire
cell phone
triple A (and proud that after owning Libba for 13yrs I have never had to use 
it!)
gas can
fluids, oil, brake, grease
nuts and bolts
bulbs
flashlight
Duct tape (The essential)
I'm sure there's other stuff in there, should have an accelerator cable too.

Have a great time, have you adjusted your valves lately and made sure your 
head is torque?
