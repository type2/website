Subject: Re: Confusing distributor mark

You know... I have a similar problem, kinda.  Whomever rebuilt the
distributor on my 76 engine put the drive dog on backwards and now
everything is off by 180 degrees.  So, when the rotor is supposed to be
pointing at 1, it's actually pointing at 4.  I have to have my wires
backwards..

But, that really has nothing to do with your post :)  After thinking
about it, I don't think it would really matter what side the little
notch is on as long as you know what cylinder is supposed to be firing
and everything else is in the correct orientation.  Points shouldn't
have any problems regardless of the orientation because it's opening for
every cylinder.(self reassurance, someone check me on this if I'm wrong,
though)  Assuming that your drive dog ISN'T reversed like mine, you know
that the cables on the right side of the distributor going to 1 and 2
will be crossed and the cables on the left will be 3 and 4, not
crossed.. 

4    /----\    1
 \--/4    2\\ /
    |      | X
 /--\3    1// \
3    \----/    2

NOTE: someone please verify that my cylinder locations are correct.  I'm
so temped to go run out to my bus and double check :p

But, let's just say for kicks that it is reversed.  That would mean that
your wires on the left side would be crossed and the right side would be
straight.  Like mine:

4    /----\    1
 \-//4    2\--/
  X |      | 
 /-\\3    1/--\
3    \----/    2

When I first got my car and did a distributor adjustment(pulling it out
and putting it back in) I put the wires like in the first diagram.  The
car didn't run at all.  Then I changed the wires to the second diagram
and it worked.  It's not that big a deal, but it just kinda bugs that
whoever worked on the distributor didn't pay attention to the notches on
the bottom of the drive dog :(

Now, what can be a big deal is if you have different curves for your
advance.  I would be weary to run a different distributor unless you
fully understand how it will affect your engine.  i.e. the advance could
be different than what was meant for that particular engine.  I would
search through the archives and find out which distro is meant for your
specific engine.  Also, check if you have the pre feb 76 or post feb 76
model because that will make a difference for the model number of the
distro.

BTW, did you check your plugs, cables, rotor, cap, etc?  make sure there
aren't excessive carbon traces in cap.

Hope that helps.

&gt; I have a 1976 FI Bus.  The distributor is not the
&gt; original one which came with the bus.  It is running
&gt; ok, but has a problem idling, seems like it is missing
&gt; occasionally.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is: The mark on the rim of the distributor
&gt; is seems to be 180 degrees away from where it should
&gt; be. If I am looking down on top of the  distributor
&gt; and I point it so the vacuum unit is straight out to
&gt; the right, then it looks like (relative to the hands
&gt; of a clock):
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum unit: 3 o'clock -- straight out to the right
&gt; Notch for distributor cap: 6 o'clock -- straight down
&gt; Condenser: 1 o'clock
&gt; Points: 10 o'clock
&gt; Mark on rim of distributor: 11 o'clock
&gt; The distributor pictures in the Haynes book (page 61,
&gt; chapter 3 section 2) all show the mark on the rim at
&gt; about 5 o'clock.
&gt; 
&gt; If I wanted to use the mark, I would have to either:
&gt; 
&gt; Rotate the distributor 180 degrees (I don't think
&gt; there is room to do this, the vacuum advance will hit
&gt; the manifold)
&gt; 
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; Switch the spark plug wires so the wires from the left
&gt; side of the distributor go the 1 and 2 cylinders on
&gt; the right side of the engine, and the wires from the
&gt; right side of the distributor goto the 3 and 4
&gt; cylinders on the left side of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have a real distributor ? Are my wires backwards
&gt; ?
&gt; What's going on ?
&gt; 
&gt; Distributionally confused,
&gt;
