&gt; &gt;     Give yourself a hour and you can take the lock
&gt; &gt; AND latch off and clean and lube both. It should OPEN
&gt; &gt; from outside, but might not unlock :)

&gt; Yes, you have a spring missing (they break).  The complete procedure on
&gt; how to fix this is contained in:

&gt; 
&gt; Do this now!  Continued operation without the spring can damage your lock
