Greetings folks!

I have decided to sell my '61 Single Cab.  I don't really want to sell it,
but I could use the money to fund another project.  I, along with the truck,
am located in east Tennessee.

If you are interested, and would like more details, you can e-mail me
privately as to avoid cluttering up the list.

Thanks,
Victor
