Subject: 78 bus



ok well its final, im getting the 78 bus, paying for it tomorrow and picking
it up on sunday. IT is a sunroof bus and the sunroof crank doesnt work does
anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? i looked under the hood of the bus
and the engine is there and it appears to be 100% complete. so i am going to
take a battery up there and see if she'll turn over. hopefully the guy just
doesnt know what he has. i am only gonna have to pay 300 bucks for the bus,
its been sitting in a lot for about 2 years. so itll have to be towed. it is
very solid, only minor surface rust and not much showing through. also, can
anyone tell me where i could get a new seal for the sunroof? thanks,
justin
