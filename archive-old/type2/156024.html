Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Start Valve and TTS

I'll give the background for this:

76 Rivi with a 2.0 and 78 (7 pin AFM) FI.

His bus starts slightly better with the AFM from the Guac, but not
much. He gets a good spray from the cold start valve when 12v is
applied directly but nothing while cranking.

Once running, it's pretty sweet. There don't appear to be any issues
aside from this hard-to-start condition. Colin suggested that moving
the wiper on the AFM is fooling the computer into providing more fuel
allowing it to start. That sounds right, but I don't wanna just
replace the TTS if it's a wiring issue, but I really don't know what
to tell him to look for.

I'm leaving town tomorrow so can't go help for a few weeks. The poor
guy's on his own with whatever help he can get from ya'll!
