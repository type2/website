hey!

well i have been working on my 72 for some time now tonight and its condition
just keeps on deteriating!

Problem: all warning lights dont come on when key turned to tha acc(or right
before it cranks)but here's the funny part....when i turn on the emergency
lights , they light uyp like theere supposed to be(only flashing)when i crank
and start it lights stay off until it revs up, then the gen light comes on,
funny thing again, when i put the emergency lights on it goes off and the fuel
level goes up(only flashes)!! huh......i am totally stumped....so is my
automechanix teacher....and those books have no chapter on my problems....hehe

ohh yea, while trying to figure it out i found a wire that aubiously had a
short running from the left side of the firewall in the engine to the ignotion
coil(top, and closest to the front it i remembver right)so i replace it with a
good wire...hook it up and start it up.....funny thing #3....when i put it in
reverse it kills(only reverse thou!) i put a volt meter on it and putting it
into rev. doesnt do anything to voltage.....1 more thing...i thought it was
running really good when i put that new wire on it....i thought i found
something..but another dead end....

also i dotn see how it whould all of a sudden do this!, even when i havent
gone under the dash and knocked wires loose and i dotn even drive it yet!!

whats up?\


Adam
