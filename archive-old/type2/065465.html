&gt; the point being that my sole crime I seem to be 
&gt; guilty of is happening to enjoy split window busses (with nary a
&gt; peace sign, dove or rainbow coloured paint job to be seen). It seems
&gt; that US border patrol cannot differentiate between this important
&gt; nuance and consider me to be a relic of the 60's intent on shipping
&gt; copious amount of mind altering substances into the USA. I mean come
&gt; on if I was intent on doing that don't they think I would be at
&gt; least chooising a less conspicuous (and faster!) mode of transport??
&gt; For referenece  whenever I drive my rusty Japanese car across the
&gt; border, no problema!  

Mike, I do concur with your sentiment here.  I am forever getting
hassled by US customs...I s'pose the dreadlocks don't help ;).  It
has gotten to the point that when I travel for business that I will
take direct flights from Canada, even if it costs a few bucks
[sometimes quite a few] more, just to avoid the abuse.

And you want to talk about no sense of &quot;Ha Ha&quot;!  I think when they
recruit these guys and gals that the form reads &quot;those with a sense of
humour need not apply&quot;.  I was passing across once [crossing at Sault
Ste-Marie] and their eyes light up as I approached [look a 'long hair'
in a VW Microbus...we gonna have a partie with this one].  In the
middle of disassembling everything, I asked if they would change the
oil and gap the valves [I was getting very bored and thought that I
would lighten things up a little]. This got them going and I had to
play the &quot;drug quiz&quot; game [Hey...at least it's not a cavity search I
thought...having enough sense not to say that one out loud].  Finally,
with both my patience and the border guards wearing thin, I pointed
across the parking lot at some yuppies in their bimmer and said &quot;Do
you really think that IF I were smuggling drugs that I would be stupid
enough to cross the border wearing dreads and driving an old VW Bus?
Hell, I would be a clean shaven, short hair yuppie in a power-suite
driving a bimmer or Volvo!&quot;  This seemed to do the trick as they let I
go...after warning I that my &quot;sense of humour&quot; could land I in jail if
I got the &quot;wrong&quot; border guard.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks [Full of bricks...of course]...Oh, my!

Roy
