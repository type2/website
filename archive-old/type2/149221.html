Hi Mark,

Surprisingly, no-one has brought this up before.

As far as I know, there isn't a enough open water at Valens for  
swimming. Most of the holes in the ice are about 6&quot; to 12&quot; in  
diameter. Perfect for ice fishing, but very dangerous for swimming.

Last year I bagged my limit while Ice Fishing... But my wife near  
drowned trying to cook it. (Ba-dum-Bump).


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
