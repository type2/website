Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

If youve done much investigating you might have noticed that the normally
closed contacts (which operate the B indicator) open with minimal pressure
on the brakes while the normally open contacts (which operate the lights)
take considerably more pressure.
What you could do is use a driver scheme or relay and use the NO as the
trigger. Essentially you need to reverse the logic. It could be done with
a minimum of parts say a transistor and a few resistors. or just a relay
and wire.
