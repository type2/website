On a more serious note on said subject - while painting the intake
manifolds I removed the EGR pipe from the center manifold and there was a
gasket of sorts that had a small hole in it (1/8&quot; - 3mm) where the EGR
connected to.  Doese anyone know why there would be such a small hole
relative the EGR pipe diameter?
Is this stock?
