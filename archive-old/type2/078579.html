BTDT.

here's how I did mine.

I did it on a parking pad behind my house, was  my daily driver and stayed
on the road the whole time.

I did a single panel/front/back/roof at a time total 9 sections so at
least nine all day sessions, so longer.

so I picked a panel, sanded and ground and patched and etc.
   when it was smooth I masked, primed and within the hour I painted  all
high quality canned paint.    not perfect but it looks pretty decent.

it took a lot of paint to get it to look decent.   van is bright white
over metallic blue...about 15 cans of white, over 12 of blue. at about
4.95 a can.

now it wasn't as good as I hoped but it is 9 years later and there are
some rust spots, I work on em one at a time.  since I bought numbered
paint and can match the colors almost perfect it is easy to touch up and
work on spots.  

pays to work on a very still day, and no chance of rain.

&gt; I've got my '70 here and it has plenty of rust to work out, some patches I
&gt; have to put in and such.  It's also sporting some nice pitted rust spots
&gt; here and there on the roof, door edges... probably the usual severe places
&gt; (Surprisingly not much at all on the underside).  I daily drive this bus, so
&gt; it can't be down for too long with any one repair.  But that is exactly what
&gt; I want to do...   repair.  So, here's my question.  I want to rid of the
&gt; rust, and prep the metal in a preferable manner.  I'm also seeing a lot of
&gt; wincing at rattle can primers.  I'm totally open to suggestion I just don't
&gt; want to be pissed when I pay someone to lay the paint on it and, well you
&gt; know.  I also don't see being able to media blast the whole thing down to
&gt; the sparkling skin and just prime right over it with the patching and work
&gt; that I need to do.  Aside of taking it off of the road, how do the
&gt; experienced group members recommend I proceed?  I'm armed with my 4&quot;
&gt; grinder, my electric sander, but not a lot more.  I can get what I need to,
&gt; but have no garage to work in.  So I've tied one of my hands and both of my
&gt; feet behind my back and want to refinish my bus in the driveway.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
