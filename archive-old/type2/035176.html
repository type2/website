Subject: New lister-looking for seals

Hello Folks:

I subscribed to the Type 2 list a couple of weeks ago and have been lurking 
around for a while.

I have a '76 Campmobile that I recently purchased from a good friend.  It's 
had excellent care and hope to continue the trend.  Having owned 3 VW 
Beetles in the past I know that parts are either plentiful or darned hard to 
locate.  I'm running up against such a search.

Does anyone know of a source for the fresh air flap seals that mount on the 
front of the bus, behind the grill, just under the windshield?  VW, The Bus 
Depot, nor my local VW shop show these seals in their catalog.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks and best regards,
Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
