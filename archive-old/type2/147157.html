Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus 1600cc dual port connecting rod

Jenny-
You spun a bearing.
Somewhat less aggravating than &quot;threw a rod&quot;,
wherein the connecting rod breaks.
An experienced mechanic will have determined
available resources for getting the bus home,
and the sum totals of the tools and costs and
time of completed repairs, based on a correct
diagnosis before that crank stopped spinning!

You will be able to do that eventually.

Remove another rod, and find the number on the
back of the bearing shell.
The crankshaft will need repair if your fingernail
finds a scratch, or the crank turned blue from heat.
Bearings are fitted in standard sizes, allowing for
.001&quot; clearance for oil, measurement must be precise.
Undersize bearings for repair are made in increments
of .010&quot; (.25mm) thicker, to compensate for grinding
the crankshaft true again. The tolerance for new to
worn out is approx. .001&quot; within each range or cut size.
Wiggling the rod does not accurately determine side play,
and is not relevant. This must be measured at the gap.
Replacement rods should match weights within 5 grams,
and should be checked when the crank is at the repair shop.

Engine was making a horrible knocking,
pulled the heads and barrels, connecting
rod #4 has too much play.

...put the &quot;new&quot; one in, and it has too much
play.  in and out (direction of piston travel)
a few thousandths.  side to side (front/ rear
of engine) has more play than the others.

I guess the bearing in the &quot;new&quot; rod isn't
thick enough?
