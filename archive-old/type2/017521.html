Hiya Mark,

With the pronounced knock on right hand turns at low speeds it is most likely 
that your CV joints need attention.  This was my situation just a couple of 
weeks ago.  Same exact symptoms.  It turned out that all four of my CV joints 
were shot.  It is a fairly easy replacement which runs about $45 a joint if 
you have to replace or $5 a joint if you only have to service (regrease and a 
new boot).  An excellent tech article on servicing CV joints can be found in 
the Type2 Library.

Insofar as sloppy shifting goes, it is most likely that your shift rod 
bushings need attention rather than your transmission.  Just replacing the 
front shift rod bushing should give you a noticeable improvement in the shift 
pattern.  The rear shift bushing is much more difficult to replace requiring 
the removal (or moving a bit) of the transmission.

Mike
