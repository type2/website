&gt; I have this problem as well. I initally had no seal on my 78's luggage
&gt; rack. I put the seal on and the noise stopped. Then I replaced the rack
&gt; when I replaced the whole pop top and just transferred the seal. The noise
&gt; came back. I am going to try and loosen the screws that hold the rack to
&gt; the bus and try to adjust it closer to the roof. I may have to enlarge the
&gt; screw holes a little in the fiberglass to get the thing closer to the roof.
&gt; I thought about maybe bending the brackets a little as well but am going to
&gt; to try this route first. The problem is that the gap between the rack and
&gt; the roof is too big so the wind gets in and causes vibration. If you get
&gt; the gap close, like 1/16&quot;, of an inch you won't have any noise and it will
&gt; still drain.

I'd like to hear from Ron's opinion (after a break from his bad week of
course) on this issue since it's so common.
