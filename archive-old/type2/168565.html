Excellent suggestion, Jamie.  I've just been fiddling with the tail 
lights on my beetle. The thread on that long screw is 4 x 0.7.  I was 
missing two from my vehicle and, rather than hunt for exact 
replacements, I just bought new screws with heads that were close 
enough. So Phil if you have any screw with this thread, use it.
Jack
