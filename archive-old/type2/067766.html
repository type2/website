Subject: painted hubcaps-'69

I have a '69 Westy with these painted hubcaps.  Not paint
over chrome, but actually _painted hubcaps_.  I have never
seen these on a bus before.  Anyone know if they are original
or whatever?  And if so, what color should they be??  I'm 
gonna put chromies on it for now, but I am contemplating a 
repaint of the originals.  They might look good, all painted
up...

TIA,

Blake
