&gt;  I have never changed an axle on a bus before. How much work is involved? I am looking to purchase the
&gt; complete axle from BD. Can someone give me some feedback on this. Bentley makes is sound pretty easy. Anything
&gt; I should know before I start? I have a 73.

drive half shaft or axle beam.??

axle half shaft is as below, don't forget to clean out the heads. and wear
disposable gloves. it isn't hard but it is messy

&gt;  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Piece of cake...... IF you remember to clean out each Allen head bolt with an ice pick first.  If the Allen
&gt; socket is not all the way to the bottom, you will round off the bolt. Then it is vise-grip time.... real
&gt; Vise-Grip brand, not Chinese wanna-be's.
&gt;
front axle beam, it is not hard but it is time consuming and the beam is
dang heavy.  plan a full weekend and have help and a couple of good jacks.
