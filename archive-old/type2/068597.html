Subject: fixed generator brushes

Howdy. I replaced my generator brushes on my 1600cc dp type 1 engine this
morning. It was (almost) as easy as pie (or is it as easy as pi? Because
that would be really hard). The old brushes were worn to a nub; they were
at least 1/4&quot; shorter than the new ones. I hope this fixes my flickering
generator light problem. FWIW, it took about 30 minutes, and the brushes
were $2.68 from the FLVWAPS (Off-Road Warehouse). Thanks to everyone who
helped. Now there's one more thing I can fix myself.
