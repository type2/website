I posted a message to the list a week ago about getting advice/help and
space to work in Seattle to fix a 2.0 liter.  I got four replies (Thank You,
fellas!) ranging from encouragement, advice, an offer to lend a hand and a
letter from a guy in the same situation.  It looks like I'll be renting a
U-haul and a trailer  to bring the bus up from Graham and working on it in
the parking stall of my studio.

I finally graduated from college in June of 99  (11 year plan) with more
debt than degree so money's going to be a bit tight for a few years.  Thus
being thrifty is my new bad habit and disregarding American consumerism, my
mantra until I can afford to play too.  And even then...

I'm not a great mechanic.  I'm not the most organized guy in the world.  I
don't know what a good price is for most things, yet.  I don't have a lot of
work space.  I don't have any storage.  Time is more often remembered than
in supply, and I've got just enough tools to at least break just about
anything.  My friend nest door is a Communist.  My cats are needy and
indifferent.  I've been shot at and tear-gassed by Fascist police within 3
blocks of my home to save jeans at the GAP.  Most of the VW buses that I
drive past look at me as if I'm nuts when I wave to them and my socks are
just loose enough to drive me crazy.  This all points to one thing in my
sharp as a bowling ball mind.  The need for a new VW co-op in the greater
Seattle/Tacoma/Everett area.

I've got wheel ramps, jacks, jack stands, tools, books, some experience,
etc. that lies unused most of the time.  It seems stupid to me to have
another like-minded (bowling ball) person, and potential friend, go out and
buy this crap when mine is just sitting there.  I know there are
difficulties with sharing things, but can it be worse than &quot;I am an island&quot;
mentality?  If only a couple of us grouped together, we could probably find
a communal place to work on our VW's,  store our parts, exchange
knowledge/help and be a Volks community.  A community of options, resources
and friends.  I see between 20 - 30 Air-cooled VW's a day, most in rough to
fair shape,  their owners all hopes and no cash, just like me.  There has
got to be a way to get this together.

I'm just tired of watching the world from behind armored glass, suspicious
and vigilant, trying to make sure no one else can take what's mine.

What about you, Volks?
