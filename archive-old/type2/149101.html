Subject: Re: [T2] Question about Sodium Exhaust Valves on 1600's

&gt;Can sodium filled exhaust valves be fitted on a 1600 engine?

If you could find the exhaust valve in that small size, yes.

&gt;If so,
&gt;how could I know if a PO had made such a modification without
&gt;extensive engine teardown?

You can't. Normally the only way to tell if to look at the face of the valve for a circule depression in the center.

&gt;OK, this is a stupid question but I can't find the answer illustrated
&gt;in Bently. Which of the valves are the exhaust and which are the
&gt;intakes?

The at the arrangement of the intake and the exhaust pipes. The two intake valves are in the inside, between the two exhaust valves.
