Subject: Carb rebuild and worn throttle shafts

I have removed my stock dual carbs and are running CB's now. I have rebuild
kits for the stock carbs, but don't want to rebuild if the throttle shafts are
worn. How can I easily tell if the shaft is worn? How loose will it be? Will
it be something easily noticeable? I have never dealt with throttle shafts and
have only done a basic rebuild of a progressive carb before, so I am not sure
what kind of wear I am looking for. If they are worn, can they be fixed
inexpensively or should I just keep them for spare parts?

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Corbett
