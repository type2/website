Volk, 

Just FYI, did you know we have an IRC chat server?  In addition to moving
the lists David Raistrick has set up a chat server for us on our new
machine.  The address is:

irc.type2_dot_com

The most commonly used channel is:

#buslist

And it is most frequently populated in the evenings, EST (GMT -5). This is
not on any net, you should come in directly.
