Won¹t start? Great! That makes it easier. (As opposed to the dreaded 
intermittent problem.)

First order of business is to determine where your problem is: ignition or
fuel? As a rule of thumb, once you¹re absolutely sure the problem is fuel
and not ignition, go check the ignition system again. It¹s pretty simple:
have someone crank while you look for spark at the end of a disconnected
spark plug wire. Even if you have a spark, give the system a once over (wipe
out the inside of the distributor cap and the wires, check point gap and
timing). If you don¹t, check the coil to distributor wire. By now you should
have some more facts to narrow down the problem.

Also, check to make sure the carburator is securely bolted to the manifold.
Front and back.

Hope this isn¹t too elementry for you and of some help. Either way we need
more facts to help you.

&gt; hello all
&gt;  i have a 1600 engine in my 1970 bus. today i decided to not want to
&gt; start. one or twice i have been able to get it running for brief periods
&gt; of time but however this was short lasted (the engine just konkes out.)
&gt; i am able to get the starter to turn over with no problem, so i don't
&gt; think i have a problem with it.  the day b4 today i was having a little
&gt; trouble keeping the bus running while i was idling at stop lights. this
&gt; makes me think that the prob. maybe with carb adjustments????? but i'm
&gt; not sure where to go from here. i can't even get the bus to start to try
&gt; any adjustments....
&gt;
&gt; if anyone has any advice comments ect....it would be gladly appreciated/
&gt;
&gt; i thank everyone in advance
&gt;
&gt; later
