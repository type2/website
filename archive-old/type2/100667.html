Subject: RE: [T2] Praise for Bus Depot (Longish)

&gt; Let's admit it, Bus Depot has some really nifty stuff which you
&gt; can't get elsewhere. They also have low prices.
&gt;
&gt; However, there's a question of setting expectations.
&gt;
&gt; I recently griped about Bus Depot on RAMVA after learning
&gt; that they had not processed either of my 2 orders after about a
&gt; week or so.
&gt;
&gt; Rocky Mountain Motorworks and California Import Parts may
&gt; not stock every item. But at least their website appears to
&gt; provide a realtime indication of when an item is in stock.


First, let me point out that it IS possible to both check inventory AND get
same or next day shipping when ordering from the Bus Depot.  Just order via
Expedited shipping (Red Label, Blue Label, or 3-day), via the website or
phone.  All in-stock items are shipped same or next working day, and we can
check stock for you immediately (while you wait if you phone; later that
same day if you order via the net).

Also, until about two weeks ago, we were shipping almost all ground orders
within 1-2 days or less. In fact, as a rule, our turnaround on ground orders
has improved dramatically over the last few months.  While the recent
container from Europe slowed us down a bit, by the end of the week I think
we'll once again be back to shipping most ground orders within a day or two.
Everyone at the shop's been putting in extra hours and effort to make it so.

That said, these same questions seem to rear their heads every few months on
this list, often by way of minor complaint such as, &quot;Bus Depot has great
prices, but...&quot;
- Why don't you have a live online inventory system like Motorworks, Cal
Import Parts, etc?
- Why don't you ship all ground orders same-day like they do?
- Why don't you have a &quot;free&quot; lifetime warranty like they do?
- Why don't you offer &quot;free&quot; tech support like they do?
- Why isn't your customer service line toll-free like theirs is?
And so on.

You basically answered your own question in your post to RAMVA (which I just
read), when you added, &quot;In any case, I will not stop buying from busdepot
because they have the largest selection of parts,&quot;  while also noting that a
particular seal you needed was $40(!!) more at Motorworks than at the Depot.

The Bus Depot's mission is best summarized by a simple slogan  - &quot;Better
Parts, Better Prices.&quot;   I go to extremes to find the best quality Bus parts
I can (even obscure ones)  - and then cut the prices to the bone.  My markup
is literally half of the industry average.  To do this, I don't spend a
single cent on overhead that isn't absolutely necessary.   I never forget
that every dollar I spend on overhead, is another dollar that you will have
to pay for your parts.

So yes, I could offer all of those extra features, and then some.  If I
spend about 30 grand, I can have a real-time online inventory system. If I
triple my payroll expenses, I can have enough people on hand to ship every
ground order same-day,  plus man the toll-free order line with trained
support staff instead of operators.  I can do everything my competitors do.

But then I'd have to charge the same prices as my competitors do, or cut
corners on the parts themselves (where it really matters), or both.  Instead
of shipping European made wheel cylinders for $10, I'd be shipping Brazilian
ones for $12.  Instead of shipping German mirrors for $20, I'd be charging
$35 like they do.  In short, I'd be another Motorworks.  But why?  The world
already has one Motorworks.  If their approach appeals to you, you should
buy from them.  Really.  It's your money and your choice.

A good analogy is a discount warehouse store like Sam's Club, versus a
full-service department store like Sears or Macy's. Sure it would be nice if
Sam's Club had sales consultants staffed in each department, checkout kiosks
throughout the store, gift wrapping, a service department, carpeted floors
and elevator music.  But if they did, they wouldn't be Sam's Club, would
they?  They'd be Sears.  Which would kind of defeat the point, because if
you wanted to pay extra for those features, you'd have gone to Sears in the
first place.

So when you say, &quot;Bus Depot has great prices, BUT...&quot; , you might want to
rephrase it &quot;Bus Depot has great prices BECAUSE.&quot;  It would be as
unrealistic to expect full-service at Bus Depot prices, as it would be to
expect a Macy's shopping experience at Sam's Club.

Not that I think our customer service is as good as it could be, even within
that framework. (And not that I haven't royally screwed up an order or two
in my day!)  In fact, we've put a major push on improving service over the
last six months, resulting in faster delivery time, a higher fill rate on
orders, and faster email response, and we still have a ways to go in my
opinion.  We want to take it as far as we can - but without raising prices
or going into debt.  We can never forget who we are - a deep discounter in a
small, enthusiast oriented business.  We're not Motorworks.  Neither are we
Amazon_dot_com.  We will strive to offer the best service we can, without
compromising on our original promise - Better Parts, Better Prices.

Like I said, a this approach is not for everybody.  That's why there are
other alternatives - local shops, VW dealers, big chains, and glossy catalog
places like Motorworks.  Each chooses their own balance of price, service,
selection, and quality, and you vote with your wallet.  This balance has
worked for us.  While many VW parts suppliers have folded recently due to
the soft economy (and even large ones are operating under or near
bankruptcy), we've continued to grow.  Part of it is our
fiscally-conservative low-overhead approach.  But mostly it's due to the
very strong support of the VW Bus community, which seems to like an
enthusiast-driven discount supplier in the market who is dedicated to Bus
owners.  So that's what I do best, and I'm sticking with it.
