&gt; (especially when they are allowed to dry out after having once been used),
&gt; that your lucky junkyard find will be a short-lived delight.



Well for only $5 I thought I might as well give it a try.

As for the 928 vacuum limiter on Pelican Parts. I see the 302 for '80-'82
for $94 . Any idea which year used the 303? They have two other models but
the numbers aren't close. Maybe the 78-79's?
