Subject: Westy Friends from South Africa

Hi all,
I am off to Singapore and Malaysia tomorrow for a few days. so I 
thought I would post to the list the following info regarding some VW 
Bus travelling friends I met just the other day.

Maybe the list can be of service to them in the way of help offers, 
while I am away.
Of course, they will have no way of subscribing to the type 2 list 
while on the road.
To do so, would swamp their mailbox on every Internet check-in.

Gayle and Richard Millar, from South 
Africa,  mailto:rsmillar_at_hotmail_dot_com   just bought a 1978 Westy here in 
the states for the sole purpose of touring Western and Midwestern 
America and Canada for the next several months.
They will later go down into Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida on 
the last legs of their trip.

They stopped by my house the other day, and we checked out a few things 
on their Westy so as to give them a bit of pre-trip assurance on some 
matters that were concerning them.

As they travel, they might run into the need for some VW shops 
locations, tech advice, etc.
You know, that inevitable &quot;I'm stuck here with this problem kind of 
help or advice&quot;.

In some cases they might just appreciate an overnight  driveway 
campsite and info chat about local sights to see, etc.

If any of you would be so kind, perhaps you could take a moment to send 
them a P-Mail with your name, contact info, location, etc. so that if 
they have a problem out there in the great unknown they will have 
someone to call for advice.

Then, when you decide to caravan Africa some day, you will have friends 
you could call on before the lions get you. :-)
