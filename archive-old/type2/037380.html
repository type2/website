Subject: Re: Overheating engine

Thank you all for your responses. Sorry but this one is a bit longer.

I have a 1979 FI 2000cc engine.
The whole story is that I had the engine rebuilt by a VW dealer but the 
engine compartment seal was not put in for some reason. I had to have the 
van shipped to me as I didn't have the time to go get it and I had moved 
provinces while it was being worked on. When I got the van I noticed the 
seal was missing and contacted the dealer. They said it didn't matter for 
now but it should be replaced before the summer. Anyways I was taking my van 
on a trip and noticed a slight lack of power and I needed to add some oil 
but there was no visible oil leak. Then I lost about 50% power so I pulled 
off and found that oil was splattered all on the engine centered around from 
the fan. I had it towed to another VW dealership where they did a 
compression test and the results were 13, 40, 55, 60 psi for all the 
cylinders. The engine itself has a 1 year/20000 km warranty on it and I've 
driven maybe 3000km since the rebuilt was put in. So now the problem is that 
the second dealership refuses to do the warranty work on the engine because 
they claim the missing engine seal caused the engine to overheat. But I 
would have to tow the van 600 miles to take it back to the original VW 
dealer to have the work done (and the thought of them doing it is not too 
reassuring).
Basically what I am trying to find out is, did the missing engine 
compartment seal solely cause the engine to overheat. Or given the above 
scenario could it have been something that failed mechanically?

Thank you to those who took the time to read this post, and I would 
appreciate any help.
