Ray &amp; Pat’s North Bound Baja Adventure ... Chapter 4 (at last)

Saturday, Feb 27th, after a full day of counting grains of sand, draining a
few full Pacifico beer bottles, and soaking up some sun, we packed up at
‘Naranjos’ Beach (now famous as The Orange Bus Beach) and headed about 50
miles North to Santa Rosalia for the night...The first hotel we stopped at
was full due to a Stateside Church group using the place as their
headquarters while in town helping an orphanage rebuild some buildings - We
saw this college-age group fill the hotel’s restaurant and they looked happy
to be here helping out...The Bartender however, didn’t look too happy
though, with all those full tables and not a sale for a Margarita or beer in
sight!...Ray thought real hard about trying to help the Bartender keep up
his
daily booze sale average, but Pat reminded him there was a long drive ahead
of us
tomorrow, and a Mexican Hangover wouldn't be very compatible...

We found several other hotels also full as there was some high school
sporting
events being held over the weekend and kids from all over Baja had just
‘rolled’ into town...We took out our trusty guide book and got down to the
‘budget’ listings, finding a small motel on a dusty side street...The owner
was half in the ‘bag’ (he obviously didn't have a long drive the next day!)
when we came by, but still had one room left at the regular 120 peso rate
($12US)...
Of course we needed to bring our own towels and TP -
but there wasn’t any shower head so we didn’t need the towels anyway!...We
did get in a couple of solid hours of Mexican TV movies, which is a real
'gas' as they show
US movies with the american actor's voices 'dubbed' into Spanish...I never
knew
Clint Eastwood had such a 'squeeky' voice before!...

We found a nice little restaurant across town that served some succulent
Lobster for dinner...they served us two ‘tails’ each, with all the regular
goodies &amp; cold cerveza’s for about 100 ($10US) pesos per plate!... Later
that night, as it turned out, about 20 members of the Cabo San Lucas High
School had taken over rooms on both sides of us and they had a great party
until about 2 in the morning!!!...The next day, we made as much noise as we
could, warming up the Bus in front of our room at 7 AM, but I think all the
kids had already gone to the ‘games’ for the day!...

We gassed up with some of that great Mexican Pemex fuel _at_ $1.72 per gal,
headed
North on Baja Hwy 1 up into the mountains and across the desert to the
Pacific Coast...The scenery is great this time of year before the heat of
summer blanches the countryside...Lots of spring wild flowers and blooming
cacti...We saw a Coyote with a grin on his face scamper across the Hwy in
front of us, and at another turn, a Road Runner charged across the asphalt
and watched us fly by...I slowed to look for an empty ‘Acme’ skyrocket
crate, but only found some suspicious looking cracks in the roadside!

We noticed that the locals just leave their cars and pickups along the side
of the road after they are involved in a crash...The vehicles just get
picked clean of anything removable and the remaining ‘carcass’ just turns to
rust...we saw about a dozen VW Bus Chassis’ just rusting away, it seemed
like there were more of them than other make...We stopped at one point to
take some pic’s of a nice ‘Splitty’ waiting to become some critter’s
shelter - the poor thing had several bullet holes in it, and still had it’s
front doors and some glass intact, but everything else was long gone - such
a waste...

As we drove North, we invented our own ‘game’ to help pass the time, whereby
we would ‘assign’ new ‘Scientific Names’ to some of the roadside objects we
saw, such as:

+Rusty-Car-e-ous-Mexicanos+ = becomes the major rusty car ‘species’
+Rusty-Bus-e-mus-Mexicanos += Rusty VW Mexican Bus Chassis (sub-species)
+Pile-A-Road-e-mus-Fix-a-mus-Pot-hole-a-mus+ = piles of asphalt used to fix
pot holes
+Axle-Bust-e-mus-Pot-hole-a-mus+ = large pot hole
+Blow-Out-e-mus-Pot-hole-a-mus+ = medium sized pot hole
+Bump-us-Erroneous+ = small sized pot hole
+Gigantus-Wind-Past-us += Oncoming 18 wheeler passing at 80 mph
+Bump-us-Ajar-us += Those damn ‘Topes’ ridges across the road at each
village
+Federales-Surround-us += Federal troop road blocks
+Gigantus-Gring-us-RV-e-mus+ = Large pusher-type motor home towing a SUV
+Bus-e-mus-Muertos-Mexicanos+ = Mexican bus passing you on a mountainous
curve
+El-Toros-Asphaltas+ = Large Bull in the middle of the road
+Las-Vacas-Asphaltas-Blockas += The whole damn herd blocking the road!
+Boulder-us-Whomp-us-Car-Top-us+ = Watch for those falling rocks!
+Insect-e-mus-Splat-e-mus-Maxim-us+ = Very large flying object on windshield

Well, anyway, you get the idea...I’m sure you can come up with some great
‘names’ of your own - you might try it next time you’re out on a long
drive - let me know your favorites and I’ll keep the list going...maybe I’ll
put them on a web site...

My own favorite for now is +‘Bump-us-Ajar-us’+, as we had to contend with
these raised ridges across the Hwy at each village or town we entered...you
can tell how large the town is by the number of ‘Topes’ they have laid down
on the road...If you hit one these ‘Silent Policemen’ at anything over
about 0.001 mph, you can count on leaving a part of your vehicle behind for
someone to collect!...At least they are well marked in the daytime, at night
might be another matter!...It’s an effective way to slow down the traffic,
as everyone, and I mean everyone slows and 'hops' over them, one axle at a
time...

We rolled into Guerrero Negro, about 215 miles from Santa Rosalia, on the
Pacific Coast side of Baja in time for a rest stop...G.N. as it’s called by
some, is the jumping off point for Whale watching in the ‘Laguna Ojo de
Liebre’ or the English version, ‘Scammon’s Lagoon, named after American
Whaling Captain Scammon who first visited the area in the 1850’s...We had to
settle for a ‘Whale’ of a lunch in town as we watched several van loads of
fellow Gringos head out to the Lagoon...The local G.N. area is also the site
of
many gigantic salt ponds - I guess all that blubber needs lots of salt!

A couple miles North of G.N. is the North/South Baja State line...It’s the
site of a
large ‘Tuning Fork’ like statue that is supposed to be a stylized
eagle...The Federales also have a military base here around a ‘bulge’ in the
road with a very large Mexican flag on a pole that’s about 10 stories
high!...These troops were a ‘spiffy’ looking bunch and had several polished
Hummers by the road...They made the obligatory look into our bus, still
looking for our guns &amp; drugs, and waved us on our way.

As we continued North on Hwy 1 we entered another group of coastal mountains
to find a group of about 25 Gringo RV’s strung out in a caravan, complete
with cute yellow stickers on each rig to keep the group in order...We
cranked on our CB Radio to find the caravan using channel 4 to advise each
member of impending dangers as the approaching and following traffic
threatened their ‘Freight Train’ like existence...Using their CB advisories
regarding the oncoming traffic; “4 wheeler - large bus - 18 wheeler - oxcart
at 10:00 O’clock”  we were able to ‘thread’ our way through the caravan over
a
five mile span...We were of course passed by numerous Mexican drivers
performing their own ‘death dance’ as they passed at every opportunity -
oncoming traffic or not!...After we had passed several of the RV’s,
someone in their group came on the CB to announce “Look out for some
north bound nut with Calif. Plates in an Orange VW Bus, the most under
powered car in
the world, was on a Kama-Kazy mission, trying to pass the caravan”!...At
this point, Ray was forced to disobey orders and break radio silence;
“Thanks
for the vote of confidence, but you’ll notice I’ve already passed five of
your rolling roadblocks”!...For some reason, that 'good buddy' didn’t even
get
back on the air with his '10-4'...

A couple of miles after breaking free of the caravan's ‘RV leader’, we came
around a
bend to find another small band of Federales, complete with their M16’s,
Hummers, and a sandbag ‘pillbox’ with a soldier holding a rope strung across
the road attached to a set of expandable spikes capable of ‘deflating’ the
tires of a 747!...They were friendly as always to we Gringos, asking us to
step out of the bus so they could count the guns &amp; drugs onboard...
as we left the area, we commented how fortunate we were to
have been ahead of the RV caravan, as we could have been held up for an hour
waiting our turn...as we basked in our joy, we heard RV leader announce to
his group via CB that the Federales were waving them all through without
stopping!!!...I wonder how many pesos ‘RV Leader handed out the window as he
passed that checkpoint!...

After a long day on the road, we finally made it to the coastal farm town of
San Quintin, about 250 miles from our last stop in G.N...After ‘washboarding
’
for a couple of miles on a sandy road towards the ocean, we found
a small motel on the banks of the bay...They had nice rooms for $20 US, and
a family restaurant where we both enjoyed a nice steak as we watched
the sun go down, the fog roll in, and the tide go out to expose those
beautiful Mexican mud flats!...The hot shower sure felt good after the days
run of about 400 miles over that narrow, two lane, Baja Hwy 1...When Ray got
up in the middle of the night to see if the tide had returned yet, he found
the room lights didn’t work...then it hit him, that diesel engine sound we
heard upon arrival was a ‘genny’ grinding out the Watts for the Motel until
everyone was settled in for the night...We would have to dig out the 12 volt
coffee maker in the morning again!...Sure am glad Ray added that Deep Cycle
battery to our machine before leaving home - we used the 12 Volt coffee
maker
about 10 times during our trip - it’s a small basket type that makes one cup
at a time - a little slow in the 12 Volt mode , but it sure is worth the
wait in the morning!...

After breakfast,  we again hit the road North...Our goal today, March 1st
was Ensenada, about 120 miles up the road...We rolled into town in the early
afternoon. After finding a nice Best Western Motel with some nice
secure, courtyard parking, we unpacked for some ‘civilized’ comfort...When
we
later took a walk, we discovered that a cruise ship was in the harbor and
many of it’s
inhabitants were loose on the streets of Ensenada!...we had to find an
out-of-the-way restaurant to park our fannies for lunch away from the
+Cruise-a-mus-Crowd-us-Maxi-mus+...people!

After Lunch, Pat caught some ‘rays’ out near the motel’s pool, and Ray
walked several
blocks to a local Internet Cafe...He arrived at just the right time,  as Ray
only had to
wait about 5 minutes to access a PC and get on the Net to send his Yahoo
update...Well, it was here, that after an hour’s session writing the events
of the past few days that Ray's machine ‘froze’ as he hit the ‘send’
button...Ah, S---!...They were nice to not charge for the hour’s ‘time’ on
the machine, but Ray wasn’t now in the mood to rewrite the trip
details!...This Cafe
had about 40 PC’s busy, and as Ray left, there must have been another forty
names on the waiting list!...Those Internet Cafe’s are a big hit in Mexico,
where computer ownership is beyond the reach of most citizens, much less the
phone line at home to even hook one too!...The crowds were similar at the
I-Cafe we used last year in Puerto Vallarta...Anyone our there want to go
‘halves’ with Ray on an Internet-Saloon down where the weather’s warm and
the
beers ice cold! - Ray will keep the beer 'up-and-running', and you can keep
the
PC’s on-line!...Sounds like such a ‘deal'...

In the evening we walked up the street to the ‘Papas &amp; Beer’ Cantina a cold
Pacifico and a plate of crunchy onion rings - yummy.  The cruise ship had
left Ensenada's Harbor, and the streets were now almost deserted!...
Later, we wandered over to Hussong’s Cantina and ‘elbowed’
our way into the mostly Mexican crowd  for another cerveza while listening
to the
noise of the 'horns' and 'strings' of a wandering band that joined the SRO
crowd
around us...Much later we found a small restaurant that was closing for the
night, but still had several roasted chickens on the ‘spit’ over a charcoal
fire...We grabbed a hot ‘roasty’ with some papas (home fries), pan (bread)
and carted our feast back to our room for a late night dinner in the glow of
our 40 watt table lamp!...

The next day, we fired up the Orange Beach Bus (now called OBBy, for short)
and made it all the way up the coast to the outskirts of Rosarito, about 25
miles - a really rough day on the road!...The weather was patchy fog along
the coast, and not really that warm...What gives here, this is Mexico,
right - we can get this stinkin’ fog at home in the San Joaquin Valley...We
found another small motel for $25 US that had a courtyard to protect OBBy
overnight...The desk clerk had a thing about loosing keys, as he charged us
a 100 peso deposit for our door key, which was returned the next day
after a through inspection to make sure we hadn’t tried to pass him a forged
copy!!!...

There was a bar next to our motel that had a gringo bartender with several
gringo expat’s on bar stools +Gringus-Bar-Fly-e-mus+, swapping tales...
Pat took out our playing cards, we ordered some ‘sundowners’ and played
our favorite multi-player solitaire-type game called ‘Hell’ for a couple of
hours...
Pat tried to get Ray ‘liquored-up’ in an attempt to assure victory at the
card
table - without much success...

In the morning, we harassed the clay pot and cement statue vendors in the
area - and there were many to choose from...We still had some unclaimed
space inside OBBy and we needed the weight of some cement garden castings to
keep us on the straight and narrow later while traveling up I-5 in
Calif...We found some neat stuff, packed it away, and headed North to
Tijuana (TJ) to attempt to crash the border with our stash of unfound,
'phantom' guns &amp; drugs...

We had one last Mexican problem to deal with before heading home...We had to
cancel our Mexican Auto Permit purchased in Nogales two weeks earlier...You
see, you need this permit to get your car onto the Ferry Boat from the
Mainland...It only costs about $11, but you have to purchase it with a
credit card...The reason being, if you don’t cancel your permit upon leaving
Mexico, they assume you have sold your car to a ‘Local’ without paying the
import duty, and so the government uses your credit card number to charge
your account for the value of your car!!!...All the guide books tell you to
find an agency in any large town so you don’t have to mess with it at the
crowded TJ border...Well, we tried in Santa Rosalia, but they didn’t know
anything about the ‘canceling’ process, we tried in Ensenada, but got “It’s
not my job, man” you must go to TJ to do it...When we hit TJ, no one we
found knew what to do, as the Gringos in Baja don’t need this car permit...

Ray couldn’t find the right street to get to Mexican Customs at their
border, so we just got in line and headed through US Customs... At the
border, we declared our 4 bottles of Tequila and ‘sailed’ right through...
We hit Mac-D for a quick Cheeseburger,
made a U-turn and headed south across the border to contact Mexican Customs
at their 'entry' roadblock - Success!!!, they canceled our permit - no
problemo -
and in 5 minutes we were on our way to U-turn again into California...Pat
wanted to
buy some smokes, as you can import two cartons/per person/per month...We
tracked down a market and bought Marlboros for $7.95US per carton!!!...With
all the new taxes in Calif now days, cartons at home cost about $32!!!...
The hell with all those guns &amp; drugs, lets go into the undercover
‘smokes’ importation business +Smoke-us-hide-us-Corrupt-us+...

We again made the turn north to the US border, and got a strange look from
the US Customs agent as she saw on her computer that we’d just been through
the gates an hour earlier...However, being our charming selves, we were
passed
right through again!!!...Damn, and we could have brought that 50 gallon
barrel
of Tequila Ray wanted to pick up over in TJ - maybe next time...

Well, that’s about ‘it’ for Ray &amp; Pats Great 1999 Mexican Adventure...we
spent a couple more days running north and had to fight the head winds up
Interstate-5 all the way home, so our gas mileage ran down to 15 MPG for
that last leg...OBBy made the entire 2900 mile trip with nary a ‘whimper’,
and only one quart of oil was required along the way - with much of that
used to keep the dust down beneath the engine when parked...

Our total fuel expense was about $250 and we didn’t have to use our Jerry
jug of fuel until just before Santa Monica on the freeway when Ray wasn’t
paying attention to the gauge, and ran OBBy dry!!!...He knew the second OBBy
lost power ,what the problem was, and coasted over to the side to splash in
a
quick 2 gallons to get us going again...As Ray was getting ready to go, Pat
noticed a contractor’s 25 MPH ‘speed zone’ sign laying nearby, so we ‘scored
’
the sign and donated it to our son’s college pad up in San Luis Obispo -
can’t have too many road signs around a bachelor’s pad, as we remember from
days gone by...

Thanks for listening, and we hope you enjoyed reading about our trip...

Hasta la Bye, Bye...
