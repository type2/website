Subject: Oil Dipstick Placement??

What's the difference in the engines with the Dipstick on top of the engine
has compared to the dipstick out the backside (sort of)?  I bought a 72 Bus
for the Type 4 motor and the guy who helped me pull it said it was a type2
motor with 1700 head from a fuel injected vehicle in the past and converted
to carbs.  He also stated it had type 4 tin.  On top of the cooling housing
it has a screw on plug to set to take off and look into to check timing.
What's the difference?

Dave
