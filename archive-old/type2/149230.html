Subject: Wide Body Mirror Mounts

Hello,
I bought these wide mirrors for my 72 bus.  They can swing outward about 10 
inches or so.  They were advertised as VW NOS 72 to 79 mirrors (they have a VW 
PN).  I believe they were a dealer option made by VW. 
Anyways, they arrived... they look great, only thing is I can not figure out 
how to mount them to my existing door mounted hardware.
Any suggestions on a possible mount.  I seen that the Thing has an extra pin 
which extends its mirrors higher (might be something to use).
Is there anyone on the list who might have these mirrors (or seen these)? If 
so could you please send me a picture of the mount hardware so I can make 
something which will work.
Thanks 
Dino Spentzos
