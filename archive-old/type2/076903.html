Subject: RE: Engine HP

&gt;I'm try to decide what I should do?  I have the opertunity to by a 
&gt;1.8 914 engine 1975. Or I can rebuild my stock 2.0 1978 FI California 
&gt;emition.  They both will need to be rebiuld regardless.  

No question about it.  Stay with the BUS 2.0!!!  

If you need to repaint the nice solid wooden door on your house, you don't 
replace it with a hollow-core that also needs to be repainted.  

There is absolutely ZERO benefit of a 914 1.7 or 1.8 motor over its 1.7 or 1.8 
bus brethren (unless of course you're putting it in a 914 and then that 
dipstick tube thing becomes very important).  The only benefit of a 914 2.0 
over a bus 2.0 is the redesigned heads that give some increases in horsepower 
(but not much in torque).
