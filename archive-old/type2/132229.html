Subject: Oil drain plug woes (again)

Okay, I posted about 6 weeks ago regarding a rounded head on my oil drain
plug, and how in the heck do I get it out.  I absorbed the replies I got,
which were overwhelmingly in favor of vise-grips.  I put it off to the next
oil change which was this weekend.  So I went after the round and very stuck
plug with the grips.  Yikes!  The bolt did not move but the head sheered off
so that the problem is much worse in that there is nothing to grip onto
anymore.  I did what I thought needed to be done.  I got a screw tap.  I
drilled a hole through the plug, inserted the tap.  It went in halfway then
snapped.  Oh man was I pissed.  The tap wasn9t cheap and the package bragged
about how strong it was.  BS man!  So now I have half the tap in the plug,
and little room to drill another hole.  Doh!  I can change oil through the
screen hole, but this bothers me.  Any ideas from listers?
