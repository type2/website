Hello,
    I wasn't going to further the thread but... I just removed a spark =
plug that I had put too much anti-sieze on and I almost cried as I tried =
to move it. I had to heat the engine just to move it. When I finally got =
it out the threads were jammed with the stuff. From now on its grease =
for me. Anyone else run into this? By the way I use anti-sieze on =
everything else.
Patrick
