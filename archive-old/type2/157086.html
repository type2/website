&gt; What's so great about these Sears Craftsman??  Well, they are the READABLE
&gt; sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the socket.  They

Hmmm, I generally look at the nut then look for a socket with a similar
size hex...

Not that I dislike Craftsman.  All of my Craftsman sockets have the
old-style small numbers.
