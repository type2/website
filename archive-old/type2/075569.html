Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

The synthetic oil &quot;truth&quot; is based on testing when? 197x? I assure you, oils
have made huge changes since then. OUR testing has shown 10-15 degree drops
in oil temps, with other engine temps staying the same or dropping, PROVIDED
you use one of a couple brands of oil.

The benefits of synthetics are not utilized if you don't have good
filtration, since to remove the dirt you have to change the oil ($$$$).

I really wish people would take a good HARD look at tests, and when they
were done, when repeating that &quot;information&quot; to everyone within earshot.
Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight weight oil, and
AM radios. Time marches on (and so does technology), don't get stuck in a
rut!

PS: There is some EXTENSIVE dyno testing taking place on certain cylinder
head chamber shapes, and deck heights, and compression ratios, on the
upright Type 1 engine, including oil and head temps, and output #s, that
will try to rid the VW World of a humongous Myth that's been circulating for
what seems like forever. Stay tuned. My lips are sealed, but you heard it
here first.
