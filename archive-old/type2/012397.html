&gt; Between the 2 of us, my buddy and I have three Type 2s ('68 crew, '70 &amp; '71
&gt; sunroof busses) with the same problem.  The dash lights on all three are non
&gt; functioning.  Is this a common occurrence or are we just cursed?  Do we need
&gt; to take the instrument pod out to fix it or should we look some place else
&gt; in the wiring?

non-functioning of just ultra-weak?  Mine are very very very dim, almost, but
not quite useless.  I have a suspicion that the wires are just shot, as I know
that current is getting through (i've checked) but i'm thinking that i'm
not getting any amps.  So, you might want to try re-wiring from the fuse box
if it's not too much trouble.  you might also just want to try wiring them to a 
live wire just to see if they light up.  I'm thinking it could also be the
dimmer circuit in the light-switch -- those pots get dirty stop functioning
if you're not careful.

let us know what you find out, too!
