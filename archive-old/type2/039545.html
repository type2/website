&gt; Hi, I had a very bad sound come from my engine/clutch today when I tried
&gt; starting it, so out came the engine.  What I found was my brand new release
&gt; bearing broke into pieces, along with the *new* mexican made clutch
&gt; operating fork.  Last summer when we put the new fork in, it was different
&gt; in a few ways from the original.  I bought it through bus depot/rmmw.  I'm
&gt; not blaming them at all, just warning others that the mexican made one will
&gt; destroy your parts!  Does anyone know where I can get a new german made
&gt; fork, or a good used one?  I looked at bus depot &amp; all they have (on the
&gt; website) is the one I already bought.  Any leads to where I can get one
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.  My bus has a '69 transmission  with a '71dp
&gt; engine.

I wouldn't be too quick to blame the origin of the part.  I've seen a lot
of German forks break at the base where many of them are spot welded only.

I weld the fork all the way around at the base and have never had a
breakage since.  Many forks seem to come this way now.
