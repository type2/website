&gt; &gt;&gt; Check the dwell/timing as you crank the engine (remote starter or friend helping) to see if it's kaput.

&gt; &gt;hard to check if it won't start, but getting no trigger from pertronix
&gt;
&gt; While the engine is cranking with the starter, there is spark so you can check the dwell/timing.

that's the problem, No spark of any kind.!!!  engine was running', stopped
power still to coil, plenty of fuel, but no spark

pertronix or coil,!!!  not sure whiche
