Subject: RE: [T2] stuck rear brakes

sorry about the delayed response, i've been out of town until this 
morning. i got many responses - all exactly the same, and all the one 
i was hoping not to have to do! it took three very unpleasant 
clutch-droppings and the rear brakes finally came undone. hopefully 
it'll be inspected and registered this week, and i'll be able to 
drive it around a bit more to clear out any remaining rust on the 
brakes.

thanks very much,

-perry
