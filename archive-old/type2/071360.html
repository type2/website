&gt; Note that such guages were not considered necessary by the factory. Think
&gt;  about that. They weren't even offered as an option. Bad data can certainly
&gt;  be worse than no data in some cases. If your procedure is not rigorous
&gt;  enough to identify bad data so it can be thrown out, you have a procedural
&gt;  deficientcy that can seriously attack your cost per mile with unnecessary
&gt;  time/money wasted worrying about an indicated problem that is in reality no
&gt;  problem at all.
My opinion on this subject is that the factory is well aware that buses run 
hot.  They run so hot that they often fail catastrophically because of it.  
They didn't put gauges in busses or even offer them as an option because they 
didn't want there customers to know how hot their engines were getting.  VW 
doesn't even publish any data on engine temperatures in busses.
I think the reason I can get 140,000 miles on an engine is that when I build 
it I pay attention to detail as Dr. Tim recommends.  I do maintenance on time 
and I have an accurate, properly installed CHT gauge that warns me when 
things are getting too hot.
