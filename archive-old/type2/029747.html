&gt; Has anyone ever put together a modified early Baywindow rear engine support

&gt; All things considered, it seems like this is a niche just waiting to be
&gt; filled.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aware of approaches/strategies that eliminate/relocate the oil filter so
&gt; a stock &quot;mustache bar&quot; will work, but it seems to me the simplest approach
&gt; would be to re-engineer/re-fabricate the support bar.

The other thing that needs to be adapted is the exhaust, if you wish to
remain with the stock muffler the tube to the heat riser needs to be
relocated to clear the oil filter.  The mexican engines have the heat
riser running the opposite
direction, but I don't know if the parts are compatible with the old tin,
though.
