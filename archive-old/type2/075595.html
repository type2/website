&gt; &gt; I agree.  My heads don't appear to run any hotter, although I'll admit my
&gt; &gt; gauge isn't that precise.  No head problems though in 90,000 straight miles
&gt; &gt; of synthetic oil usage.  I don't need a book to tell me it works (or
&gt; &gt; doesn't work).  Go to a Nascar race and see how many of them are not using
&gt; &gt; synthetic oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Which shows another advantage to synthetic: lower friction. For us that
&gt; means better gas mileage and less wear; for them it also means more

I did a test on my bus about a year or so ago.

finishing a break in on my new rebuild and still had dino break in oil,,
10w40 Sunoco if I recall.  did a hundred fifty mile test interstate, main
roads, stop and go. etc.
  changed to synthetic, Penzoil Performax 5-50 next day ran same course,
temp was the same humidity was the same and compared my gauge readings.  

I could detect no significant difference in temps. (VDO oil sump
guage) although presure seemed to stay higher when hot with synthetics. 

so in MY van and only in my van I have impirical evidence that it works.  

I also got 214k on the original engine with only a ring job and replaceing
a valve, using synthetic the entire time I owned it (last 100k)


&gt; horsepower. (It means more potential HP for us too, but if I have 67hp

horsepower??????  whatzat???
