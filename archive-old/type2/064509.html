Again stuff we have dealt with but in particular,

1. make sure you got the lower screws near the tranny mounts
from below if present.

2. there are 3 clip sort of things along the top edge, you will
either deform or nearly deform the panel to pull it without
removing the engine it is possible but tough.  A couple of
putty knives under the top edge levering the top lip free while
you try to get the lower lip over the engine tin is the technique.

Good luck
