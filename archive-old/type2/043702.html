Subject: Re: &quot;Ever seen one of these on fire?&quot;

I heard a sad story yesterday.  A friend's friend was driving her '70 bus to
drop off two foster kids at their new, permanent home.  All of their worldly
possessions, her dog and herself were in the bus pulling up a grade when she
felt a sudden loss of power, and saw smoke pouring out the back.  She pulled
over and got kids and dog out.  It didn't take long for the whole bus to
burn away.  She says, &quot;only the shell was left&quot;.  I didn't see it, but it
sounds like the dreaded cracked or broken fuel line problem.  She did not do
her  own work, maybe only looked in the engine compartment occasionally.  It
makes me think we should all put big stickers on our rear windows advising
&quot;HEY AIRCOOLEDS, CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES!&quot;.  Maybe we could start leaving
notes under the windshield wipers of Type 2s we admire in parking lots, too.
Sorry for this bummer posting. I know we've all heard it before but, keep
spreading the word.
