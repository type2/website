I believe that last bolt is the upper right engine mount bolt..  one of the
four that hold the engine to the transmission.  Hope that helps..

&gt; Hello Everyone...Well I am trying to get my darn starter out of my 71
&gt; Campmobile...I have the idiot book, and also the &quot;removing a Starter&quot;
&gt; instructions from Type2 library..but I am a little frustrated/stumped by
the
&gt; bolt behind the fan housing...I got the solenoid, hot wire, and the bottom
&gt; bolt undone...just can't find what I should find behind that fan
&gt; housing.....Any helpful hints would be great...Thanks a bunch..Adam
