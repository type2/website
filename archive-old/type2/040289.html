&gt; This will wound like a silly question to most of you, but what is EGR?

Exhaust Gas Recirculation

&gt; Is it to do with US smog control or something?

yup

&gt; There's also some form of large blower under the front belly pan.

Probably the remains from an air conditioning system.   They had a
condenser (or was that evaporator, can never remember which is which)
under the front pan and for when the vehicle wasn't moving fast enough it
had a large (sometimes two) fan that blew air over the coils.   check to
see if there is a radiator type cooler and two heavy black hoses running
to the rear.

(or it is water cooled, nah)

&gt; Is this anything specific to US vehicles?


more or less.
