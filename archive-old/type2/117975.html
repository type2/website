Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

Hi Folks,

Perhaps it's just my Bus or it was another cost-cutting measure by VW, but 
my taillight assembly does not have a reflective surface inside.  Instead, 
it's just gray plastic back there, and it DOES NOT reflect ANY light back 
out the lens.  Perhaps this is why the tail and stop lights are so dim...?

Anyway, I found that a good solution was to paint the inside of the assembly 
with Chrome Silver paint -- available at finer FLAPS and home supply stores 
for about $2.99 a can.  It effectively doubles the light output, and it does 
not affect the light's function.  In addition to that, my bulbs were very 
dusty from many (10? 15? 20?) years of use, and they benefitted from a good 
cleaning.

As always, YMMV.  Good Luck!
