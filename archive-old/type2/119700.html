Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Fan Broken,Broken down

  Hello Guys  This isn't that hard of a job to do in the bus.  I didn't see 
the first post so I'm assuming it is an up right type 1 engine?? Take the nut 
off the fan by holding the nut and turning the shaft at the pulley end I do 
this by taking the pulley apart leaving the inner half on the shaft and using a 
creasent wrench to turn it. After removing the nut wiggle the fan loose from 
the genarator and you can remove the gen leaving the fan in the fanhousing . you 
dont need to remove the stand either. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
