I just wanted to give some of you a heads up about a motor fuel. We just =
had a problem with something.. a mysterious liquid sediment, heavier =
than gasoline, found in our fuel tank after problems with engine idling =
(dying) and running (backfiring and running rough, lack of power). We =
buy 95% of our gas from the same company outlets (same corp, two =
stations). These particular stations often feature a large, rotating, =
illuminated orange sphere. We generally use a 91 Octane. Last week I had =
problems with another engine not idling. The 91 truck has also been =
stalling out and running a bit rough, but we thought it needed a tune =
up. Well, tonight, hubby was stuck at work and called for a rescue. I =
came out with a family friend and tools. Friend is also very =
knowledgeable about engines and fuels. So, he brought out some clear =
containers and we sampled the fuel. It has a clear liquid settling out =
of it. We thought, &quot;Aha! Water!&quot;, but when we tested it with a water =
testing paste, there was no reaction. According to some other past =
experience, we think that it may be an alcohol product that was =
introduced or blended to raise octane and/or lower emissions.. but it is =
separating from the fuel. There were also small bits of rust in the fuel =
filter, and alcohol can introduce rust problems too, because it absorbs =
moisture. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this needs watching. =
I could see the line of demarcation between the lighter fuel in the test =
container and the heavier clear liquid. We are going to look into =
further testing with an alcohol sensitve paste. Will keep you posted.=20
