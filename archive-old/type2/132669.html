Subject: removal of ignition housing

Last fall, in response to my inquiry to the list, Richard Atwell 
directed me to the following link (thanks again Richard):

http://webpages.charter_dot_net/bclausen/How_to_files/ignSw/

It provides very helpful step by step instructions, including ample 
photos, for removal of the ignition housing and installation of a new 
ignition switch.
