Subject: Re: [T2] Goodbye am radio.

&gt; Unbelievable that they turned down a CASH sale over an address.
&gt;

Not to me.

My son was into those R/C cars you can only get at the shack a while ago. He
made a purchase but the clerk screwed up and didn't use the gift card my son
got for Christmas. The SOB manager made him wait while they checked out
every other customer in the store before refunding his cash and using the
card! I, waiting by the door, was livid and went off on the manager. He blew
me off like I wasn't there.

I'll never EVER go to Radio Shack EVER again. Luckily my son's no longer
interested in those cars.

(My favorite joke at their expense, &quot;You've got questions, we've got blank
stares.&quot; So true!)
