I hope this does not post twice but I'm having mail problems. Please
excuse....

My bus ran great on the way to and back from EB. Plenty of power, ran cool,
and no major problems except one- bad gas mileage. I have a 71' westy with a
rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, fully balanced, Jacob's ignition, Berg
extractor, 1.25 rocker arms, and dual Kadrons. I am using a single can
vacuum dizzy, set for 30 degree total advance.I have been making these
modifications over the winter and did not drive my bus much because of the
ice/snow. Valves are adjusted, carbs synced and everything else is in spec.
Best mileage I could get on my trip was 15.5 mpg.

My question is- how does one trouble shoot bad gas mileage? Any suggestions
on where to look first, tests to run, etc. The wisdom of the list is
needed!!!! as always TIA TBear
