Hey y'all

Everybus is fast approaching, and with it the First Annual Everybus 
EveryChili Extravaganza.  You are each challenged to cook up a pot of your 
very best chili and submit it to our internationally famous panel of judges 
on Saturday evening.

The internationally famous panel of judges is being kept Top Secret due to 
national security concerns.  The panel doesn't even know they're on the 
panel (yet) to prevent attempted bribes, kidnappings or other multinational 
high-jinks.

There will be only 2 categories, meat and vegetarian.  This makes it simple 
for 2 reasons.  First, I don't have to dig into the dead parts bin for lots 
of prizes.  Second, these are the 2 basic categories and anything else would 
rapidly degenerate into overkill.

If someone wants to bring additional valuable prizes to donate as part of 
the festivities, so much the better.  I already gave away my supply of screw 
on spark plug tops and used main bearings as prizes at other campouts so I'm 
down to the used oil filter supply or a hardened tube of Hylomar.

Make a large pot, because that way you can help feed the hungry horde of 
camp happy busers who are sure to descend upon Hagen Stone State Park.  If 
you need more information, you should point your browser to this very URL: 
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/eb2001/ and Chris' web site will tell you 
much more than I can in 1 e-mail.

Remember, this is YOUR chance to win the Internationally acclaimed First 
Annual Everybus EveryChili Extravaganza.  Your name (or pseudonym if 
desired) will be published far and wide on the Internet as a winner!  You 
could win valuable prizes (though doubtful).  You will most certainly win an 
invitation to return next year and take on all challengers again.  Or you 
may judge next year's event, your choice.

See you there, and remember - Everybus is a good event to eat chili at!

Mad Uncle Dave
