Subject: Re: [T2] loose cam bearing?

Chris
&gt;About 6,000 miles on my AVP rebuilt motor, and starting back in 
&gt;October it started making a funky sound.
&gt;
&gt;the local mechanic said it sounds somewhat like a loose cam bearing.

	Try a stethoscope.  Even if it doesn't lead to a conclusive 
diagnosis, it's great fun.  Just pretend you're a blue (or possibly 
humpback) whale in the deep ocean, and try to place the sound.
	The ex-medical ones aren't as good as those with a special 
'front end' intended for metal.
