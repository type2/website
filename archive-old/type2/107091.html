Subject: &quot;B&quot; light on dash

Ok, so I thought it was for the battery, but maybe it's for the breaks? 

I thought it was for the battery, since the time my ALT belt broke, it
came on. But recently, when I pull the emergency brake, it light's up.
What the heck? Not very often, and if I just push that little button the
emergency brake usually butts up against and let it spring out again, it
goes away. 

Um, huh? 

Christopher
