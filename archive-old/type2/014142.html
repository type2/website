&gt; Steve, looks to me, from the pix you posted, that someone actually braised
&gt; the sender to the plate, intentionally. If this is the case, I wouldn't

Jesse,

Cany you say &quot;synergy&quot;? :-)  Your mail got me thinking... the sender is
*not* brazed to the plate, tho it sure does look like it.  What is going
on is that the plate is formed from a sheet of mild steel, then a threaded
collar is brazed to the plate.  the sender threads into that collar.

All well and good, but what happened is that I then got thinking.  I had
not wanted to clamp anything to the plate, because I didn't want to
distort it and cause a leak. *BUT* I didn't have to!  I could clamp onto
the collar!  So I went out, socked &quot;Mongo, the Vice Grip&quot; (my 12LC) onto
it and cranked that pup right out!  YAY!!!! Thank you!!!!

Now....  with the sender out, each of the flats has a message engraved!
they read:

VDO
2.77
200 C Max
6-24V
801/7/2
Made in Germany

I can't find a mike at the moment :-( but will mike it for thread diameter
ASAP.  I will bet that it is M14x1.5, tho.  Looks courser than 1.25 and
the socket size is 19, not 17mm.

JD, thanks for the inspiration!
