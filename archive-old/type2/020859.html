If you aren't locked out,
open your drivers side door. There will
be an allen bolt or two on the side
of the door. (I forget exactly)


Remove these. You are now holding
your door handle in your hand.

(this is from memory, a few years back)

On the back of the latch, there is a catch
on the lock core. The catch will have
the numbers printed on it. 

this should really be all the farther apart you
need to take it.

I tore mine all to heck and have yet
to put it back together, although I do
have keys for it now :)

Modify the procedure as need to remove your door handle.
I really want to think it's only two externally accessible
allen bolts. And you don't have to take the handle apart.

good luck
matt
