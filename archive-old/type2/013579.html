Subject: Transaxles and Throw-Out Bearings

From: &quot;Thomas J. Tarka&quot; &lt;tommy_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;


The players:
  - '71 Bus
  - stock (?) tranny:  Serial#: 002 301 103A
  - old TO-bearing, stamped with the number: 3159 ?10 037 (I think)
  - new TO-bearing, P/N: 3151 193 041

Story so far:

The clutch was making a throw-out bearing-style noise, so
I went ahead and ordered a TO bearing and pulled the 
engine.  This was followed by my parts person going on 
holiday.

So this weekend, I finally take a look at my transaxle and
find:

a) the oil in the transaxle that I thought had come from a front
	engine seal had probably come from the transaxle seal

	note:  i replaced this seal 4000 miles ago, and, I 
	       checked my tranny fluid level ~2000-2500 miles ago and 
		it was fine.  Checked it yesterday and it was
		a bit lower than I would like to admit...

b) the new TO bearing doesn't look like the old one.  
   specifically, the new one has:
	-- smaller clips and these are actually attached to the TO
	-- a metal casing on the backside of the outer ring (race?)

   is this because the new bearing is of the &quot;ball-bearing&quot; instead of
   &quot;carbon block&quot; type, that Kuhn talks about in his type2 TO bearing
   replacement article in the library?  (http://www.type2_dot_com/library/drivetra/kuhn6.htm)


So, this prompts a couple of questions:

a) Is this new TO-bearing ok for my tranny?  I couldn't seem to find a part
	number that corresponded on the one or two websites i checked.

b) The tranny seal, when I installed it, seemed loose around the shaft:
	is this normal (must be, so the shaft can move, right?)

   Did I just muck up the install somehow?  (not pushing the seal 100% flush,
	just 99%?  Scored edge somewhere that the seal isn't seating properly
	on or isn't sealing?

c)  is 002 301 103A a PN for a stock manual transmission on a '71?  If it's
	not, perhaps I got the wrong transmission seal in the first place,
	which caused the leaking...

Thanks for you ideas and thoughts, as usual!

ps yes, I do know that I need to replace the oil-soaked clutch disc.  :)
