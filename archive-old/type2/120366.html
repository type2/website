&gt; &gt;noticed that I could hear the fuel pump running quite loudly while

I agree that you should not be able to hear it or only hear it if you are
concentrating but a noisy pump is not necessarily bad.  I think Mr.
Thorpe is on the right track with replacing the fuel filter first.  I also
urge him to hurry.  Many times the noise you hear at the beginning of a
clogged fuel filter is the sound of the rollers cavitating as they try and
fail to pull fuel through the filter or other obstruction.  Since the pump
is cooled by the fuel flowing though it this cavitation will cause it to
fail if left unattended but if this just popped up as a symptom then you
may well save the pump with a new filter.

When you replace the filter mke sure that gasoline flows freely through
the line from the tank to the pump as well.  In buses that have sat (this
is not for Mr. Thorpe but rather for general consumption) the fuel can
develop tarry deposits, the hoses can swell shut, or debris can block the
tank outlet.  Any of these will block flow to the pump and will cause a
noisy pump.

                             OOK!
