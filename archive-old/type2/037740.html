Original canvas needs replaced, needs paint job.  Standard layout with 
everything in place.  No tent or stool.  Rosie needs to have her idle circuit 
looked at, but she drives OK.  No pictures available on the net but if you 
are interested I can take some.

THE PRICE:  U$1500.

THE OFFER:  I have a son who is a NIASE certified Master (He has worked on 
all our VW's...but this one is the last, I think). He and I will work with 
you on Rosie's mechanical needs if that is your wish.   I will consider 
putting one or two folks up for a few days...(think Spring Break in 
Sarasota!)  My wife is a Chef and meals are included.  You could use my tools 
to make any adjustments you wanted before leaving.  I'd fill your tank and 
pack you a lunch...and you are then on yer own...Oh Yeah, the offer kicks in 
after you buy her (not that any of you guys would try for a free 
vacation...right?)
