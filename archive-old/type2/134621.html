Subject: Re: [T2] heat-defrost-fresh air lever removal

Was assked:

I checked the archives with no luck , concerning the trick to removing heat/
fresh air/ defrost levers from underneath the dash. I'm trying to remove
instrument cluster and am stuck. THANKS. 73 Westy
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

IF you have a 73 westy, you should have 2 red knobs and 1 blue knob, all on metal
arms. They are held in by metal spring clips. Just pull, they will come out. 
I looked at a 73 in the yards today and it surprized me, it had the later all-plastic levers. 
They just pull off also.
