Subject: 35mpg from a bus??
Message-ID: &lt;3737088c.5526435_at_post_dot_demon.co_dot_uk&gt;

Sorry to dice with starting another FART, but I've got to get some comments on
what happened the other night:

I was looking over a rusty bus for a friend (He has an LHD late bay - no sills
or interior - and had been offered a rusty, engineless, RHD '73 camper in lieu
of some cash for a computer deal). The owner of the camper has put 300k miles on
it, and gone through 3 engines. He still has the last engine which he has pulled
to put into a '63? &quot;American model&quot;? Beetle. We talk about where he has been,
and I comment that it must have been expensive on petrol for his regular trips
to London, Scotland, etc. This is where he drops his bombshell: 28-30 mpg around
town, 32-35 mpg on a long run. I am politely sceptical about this, so he takes
me into his garage where he is &quot;tarting up&quot; the engine, and says &quot;What you need
is that set-up&quot;. 

He has a 1600DP with an extractor exhaust (EMPI), a dual choke progressive
Webber on a trick manifold (looks like the stock centre portion without the
heater pipes, except there is a square alloy casting where the upright tube
would be, which mates up with the Webber carb. He says he also has bigger valves
in the heads, and a mild cam, but the carb / exhaust were the magic. Claims he
could get the bus upto 80mph with this set-up. He's an intelligent bloke, I
don't think he's BSing, he's obviously had the bus long enough to know it inside
out, but 35 mpg!! Imperial gallons, that is -  more than 40 mp(US)g ?

Can there be any truth in this? :O

I asked him what carb it was, and he couldn't remember, but guessed at DCOE35.

For those of you across the pond, we pay the equivalent of $4.50 per US gallon
for petrol, so this is very dear to my heart, and is the only serious threat to
a lifetime's partnership with my bus. I've seen the mileage figures on the web
page, and mine currently tally with some of the better ones there (20 mp(UK)g).

If there is any truth in this, where can I get hold of the correct carb? (His
carb isn't for sale). I've seen oblique references to using progressive carbs
&gt;from other makes of car - is there any proven combination?

If there isn't, then it's back to trying to source a Bosch CIS injection set-up.
(I get what I assume to be the normal, poor, part-throttle response with a
34-pict3 (tried 2, also tried plugging the hole in the throttle plate) and the
009. I've got several vac advance distributors, but I can't get any better
mileage or drive-ability with them than the 009. I haven't tried opening up the
main jet - I'm a bit reluctant as it isn't reversible, and I may end up with
worse mileage than I have now. Exhaust is stock, valves, compression, etc. are
OK. Work continues.)
