Subject: 1969 european double door for sale

Hey Everyone,
I just thought I'd give all of you the head's up on the bus my mechanic 
is selling before he posts it up on other sites.  It's a 1969 double 
door that was imported from Amsterdam a while back.  It's in great 
condition.  Here are the specs:

Mechanics:

-New brake shoes and wheel cylinders
-Rebuilt transmission with .082 4 gear
-Engine rebuilt by trained VW mechanic with less than 500 miles on rebuild
-Most outstanding and very RARE feature is the sliding doors on BOTH 
sides. Both doors work perfectly as does everything on the bus


Features:

-Everything is stock except for 1641cc single port engine
-Tach mounted in clock location (looks like factory tach)
-European delivery
-European tail lights
-Rare momentary high-headlight switch
-Rear seat converts to bed
-Body is completely straight  no dents  never been in an accident
-Owned and operated by factory trained vw mechanic for 25 years

He wants $8000 for it.  Email me privately if you are interested and I 
can send you pix.

Thanks!
Mike
