Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Column Removal?

Phil,

Unless it has been removed there should already be a wire for the horn going
through the column and there should be a male spade already at the bottom of
the steering box for the horn wire, coming from the horn. It's not easy to
reach but if you go up into the steering box with your fingers you should be
able to feel the spade. The wire should already be there and may have just
become disconnected. This happened to my old bus, and it did take me quite a
while to connect the wire back, as you can just barely get your fingers in
there and move the wire around.

It's tough to imagine the wire broke in the column or are you just doing a
complete new installation or something? I hate to see you do all that work
to find the wire is already there!! As far as pulling the wire through...the
steering box is kind of in the way for you to put a new wire &quot;up into&quot; the
column. It wouldn't be pretty, but it might be easier to just run the wire
down the column on the outside and through one of the plug holes in the
floor to the horn. Like I said this wouldn't be pretty, but would work and
if nothing else help you to test it all out before removing the steering
box.

Hope this helps,

Rob Henley
