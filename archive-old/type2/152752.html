Subject: Re: [T2] Brake drums

Gotta crawl thru a &quot;dusty&quot; folder in the cobwebs of my so-called mind, but
I vaguely remember from my days of &quot;loose&quot; association with the owner of Bus
Boys (circa 93 thru 97) when he was exploring various configurations for
rear disc brake kits.  If I remember correctly (and please someone do
correct me if I'm wrong,) the mounting holes of the Vanagon Bearing Housing
for the backing plate are reversed (upside down) from what the 71-79 Bus
is.  This would make a difference on how/where the hand brake cable would
enter if such a swap took place (and of course IF I'm correct).  I don't
have a late Bus handy to compare with my Westy, so I can only go by memory
(such as it is)

BTW:

ATE 24.0225-2001.2 = 71-79 Bus Rear Drum

ATE 24-0225-2002.2 = 80-91 Vanagon Rear Drum

&gt; A quick check/looksee just now shows that although the inside diameter is
&gt; the same, the biggest difference is in the outer groove where the backing
&gt; plates mate to it (backing plates for 80-91 Vanagon and 71-79 Buses are
&gt; differently shaped [not much, but just enough for a difference]).  In
&gt; addition, the groove on the outer lip is larger by a few 16ths of an inch
&gt; on
&gt; the Vanagon drum to account for this difference.  Looking at them side by
&gt; side, I would speculate that you *could* use Vanagon drums on the Bus, but
&gt; not vise-versa due to the design differences stated above.

&gt; Great info Jim. So my next question: does the Vanagon backing plate has
&gt; fitment issues on the baywindow bus?
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, ATE Drums for both models are now being made in Italy, ATE shifting
&gt; all of their production from Germany in the past year or so.  There is
&gt; another brand, OMC, but I haven't seen these.
&gt;
&gt; I've noticed several vensors selling those now.
