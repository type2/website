Subject: Re: [T2] changing odometer reading with a drill

I swapped my speedo in my Mustang ('1981) long ago to gain a trip ODO and wanted the mileage on the newer ODO to match the mileage on the old ODO. Hooked up a drill and ran it full speed and it said 35 mph. Uh no. This is going to take a month. So I learned to disassemble the ODO and fixed it all up in 20 minutes or so. I can see why all the used car dealers have goten in trouble over the years. Too easy to do the mileage change, and too easy to see evidence of the tools required. Of course I don't worry about the ethics of doing this to a vintage vehicle since the ODO only shows 99,999 miles and who knows how many times it has rolled over... Besides everything on a vintage vehicle has been futzed with... &lt;grin&gt;
