Subject: Re: [T2] burned...

no dont do that that would suck on your part..
if they want to get high enough then they will find a bag somewheres else..
dont be a ass and sale them some bull s**t!

just because you drive a bus they think you are a smoker there bad for being stereo typical..
not all bus owners are hippies and not all bus drivers are smokers or do acid or shroomz or what not whatever hippy folk do ... which is still being stereo typical..
i have know many true hippy folk throughout my life and have know some of them to just be a hippy without the smoke or other things..

dont sale them no oregano... 
pass out bad karma expect to get it back three fold..,

as a kid this would be a good idea but i am takeing it that you are older than just some kid lol and not saying you are a old folgie either ... lol
peace and have a good day..

&gt;Moral dilemma...
&gt;Stopped at an auto parts store for some oil, and when I returned to
&gt;my Bus, a couple young (17/18) guys were lookin' at it. After a little
&gt;chit chat, one of 'em asked me if I could get him some 'weed', since,
&gt;&quot;you still smoke, right?&quot; Well, actually I don't, and I was wondering...
&gt;Would it be a bad thing (shades of Martha Stewrat), if I told 'em to wait 
&gt;there and I'd be right back with some 'weed'. Now I figure I could get to 
&gt;the Shop-Rite and buy two bucks worth of oregano and bag it up in about
&gt;a half hour. If I sold it to them for twenty-five bucks, I'd make a profit
&gt;of twenty-three bucks...My dilemma: Does the list think this is a 'fair' 
&gt;profit margin or not... ?-)
