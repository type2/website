Hey folks...

For those that dont know, I install and repair sunroofs professionally.
But my curiousity is mostly personal...:)

Baywindow sunroofs cables, AFAIK, are completly unavailable.  The cables
one may find in a junker are very likely to have the same problems your
current ones have (which are either stripped, or the cable has broken at
the connection to the guide...), and of course, are not of much use.

Vanagon cables are available, at an average cost of 60 dollars each.  (a
decent price, btw..)

Now, I've never had oportunity to see or touch either a vanagon sunroof,
or a baywindow sunroof....But I get the feeling they are essentially large
versions of the roof used in bugs, rabbits, scirrocos, jettas, etc. (at
least up till 84ish, and perhaps into the A2 year ranges..A3ish roofs are
a differnt story all together)
I'll note that this roof is also similar to some Volvo and Audi roofs,
too...


Anyhow.  Just got a few questions for all you bus/vanagon sunroof owners
(factory roofs only, I dont wanna know about you're leaking 70's
aftermarket popups!:)

Does it operate correctly?  Opens fully, closes fine and completely? 
Does it grind and/or is it hard to move?
Does it leak?
And...do bus/vanagons roofs vent? (open so the rear lifts to allow
ventilation..)  Or are they open/close only?
Have you (or anyone else..) ever worked on it, to your knowledge?  What
was done?

and...who lives in the southeast?:)  And who had a spare (or a
old/used/broken!) set of cables for their roof?  

I'd be very interested in borrowing a set of either new, or used, or
broken/bad cables for both the vanagon and the baywindow, in order to
compare them to each other, and to other similar cables, to attempt to
find a replacement for the NLA bus cables.  

For those bus folks who have to keep their roofs shut with wood or foam
wedges (or not at all!), I'd like to find an economical replacement, to
either allow partial or full functionalilty.  I dont think anyone who's
roof DOESNT work, would complain if it could be repaired (cables only..)
for around 100 dollars in parts, even if (on the idea that rabbit cables
may work) it only opens half way (but closes completely!)

Anyhow.  All your replies would be welcome, but please direct them to me,
and not the the lists (keen_at_digital-galaxy_dot_net would be fine...)

Thanks, and I'll keep everyone informed on what I find out.

...david
