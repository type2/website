Subject: RE: [T2] aftermarket, intermittent wipers

Chris,

My take on this is that you have to provide some means (i.e., a electrically
separate/isolated switch contact) to turn on the delay - based on the
description of the stalk mounted switch having a separate delay position.
Not having either a Golf or Vanagon wiring diagram to reference, I can't
tell if it's OK if this contact closes simultaneously with the non-delay
slow speed contact, or not.  The wiper switch in my bus has 3 positions,
OFF, SLOW and FAST.  With that as a given, I can imagine that, if it is OK
to have the slow speed contact closed when the delay is operating, then, I
could add a separate pushbutton to signal the delay to turn on and then to
&quot;program' it for delay time.  But I'd rather not experiment without more
information on this.

Anybody got a wiring diagram for this delay relay?

Check out: http://149.149.27.28/tech%20folder/Wiper%20Delay.zip

Hope this helps.

And if you can teach me anymore about it please do. This is just info I've
collected. Doesn't mean I've tried any of it. I'm also halfway looking
around for a relay like this so if you find a supplier speak up! &lt;grin&gt;
