Hello group!  Hope you can help.  Just redid the brakes on &quot;Floyd&quot; my '78
Riviera.  I put on new drums, rotors, shoes, pads, rubber lines, rear wheel
cylinders, spring kits, calipers, emergency brake cables, master cylinder
and new inner and outer front wheel bearings. Bled all brakes and bench bled
master got no air in lines and my pedal is very good (i.e. face though
windshield fist time I stopped).  Question.  Why when I go to stop is the
bus shaking it is just not smooth I'm not sure what to call it, modulation
maybe?  Any help would be wonderful!

Also I need to replace my rear engine mounts and want to know if I can do
this with the engine in the bus. &quot;Floyd&quot; does not have a 2.0 any more, it
bad um kay. he's got a '73 Porsche 1700cc that's about a 1920cc not sure
exact number will this make a difference? Looking foreword to responses.
Thanks in advance.
