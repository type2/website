Subject: Re: [T2] waxing  pop-top hinges

Parafin should work fine and is readily available. You don't need to get it
at a craft store. You know those little tea lights, the plain white ones
that are unscented and sold everywhere? (You may even already have some
around the house.) It's parafin. Just remove it from its little aluminum
holder and wax away. Craft stores will charge you an arm and a leg.

If you want an amazing selection of waxes for this and other purposes,
sculpture supply stores have a range of all sorts of temperature
sensitivities and pliabilities/brittleness. My favorite place locally is
Douglas &amp; Sturgess, who are online at http://www.artstuf_dot_com/waxes.html.
(This site should be fun for some of you Volks to polk around in, if you
like to innovate your own parts, etc.)
