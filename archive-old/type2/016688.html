Subject: Re: Weber Progressive and 009

&gt;I don't think it will ever work well, unless you're in Phoenix,
&gt;certainly not in the upper 49 state region. ther's a good reason VW
&gt;never made a single carb 1.8-2.0 and it wasn't just to raise the sales
price.
&gt;Sorry to be the bearer of bad news!

I have a Weber Progressive on my 77 Westy and it runs great. It idles
sweet, has just as much power and I still get 18-21 MPG - just like I
did before my FI system died. I can't remember where I bought the Weber,
but I bought it as a kit for my year bus (mail-order). I use it with a
stock vacuum/centrifugal dizzy. 

I have buddy who used the Weber with 009 and couldn't get above 15 mpg
and still have it idle well. He finally went with a stock dizzy and all
is well - he gets the same mpg/performance that I do.

The 009 is really a silly thing for street use. It's really meant for
'always full throttle' applications (race track). The 009 does not
advance enough in non-full throttle situations, this is why advancing
more at idle helps. Goofing with timing on these air cooled engines is
not a good thing. I highly recommend sticking with the the stock timing
curves - based on RPM *and* vacuum.

Alas, there seems to be many people that have had trouble getting a
stock distributor to work with a Weber Progressive. (No vacuum advance
connection on carb, or some such problems). There may be different
models of the Weber carbs - some may not have connections for vacuum
advance distributors.
