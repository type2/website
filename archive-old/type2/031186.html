&gt; When removing the motor can you leave the metal tin that acts as a fire

good news/bad news

you can leave the tin, but just about everything on or through it has to
be removed.

I usually remove the gas lines on the tranny side of the tin.
don't forget a small wire to the harness on the right side, for gen light
(blue I think)
also if it is an automatic you have to drain the tranny fluid and remove
the dip stick/fill tube that goes through the tin (don't miss the bracket
that holds the tube on top of the tranny (frequently removed or missing)

also the auto tranny accelerator linkage must be removed in a special way
(in the Bently manual)

if it goes through the tin it has to be removed.
