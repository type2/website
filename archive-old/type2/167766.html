Subject: Re: [T2] Vent window hinge rivet

Paul,

The hint from whoever still sells those is to have it out of the bus, put
a bb under the hollow end on a big anvil or vise, have a friend hold the 
frame and the hit the rivet with a big punch and hammer.

I tried making a tool from a 3 foot bolt cutter and it aaalllmost 
worked...but not well.


If you use a pop rivet(cause it's in the bus), think about a metal one 
rather than aluminum....


Cheers, dave

&gt; OK Folks,
&gt;
&gt; including the type2 library and archives, to no avail.  I'm bleary eyed and
&gt; have given up.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone either tell me how to set these rivets or where to get the tool
&gt; to do it with?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
