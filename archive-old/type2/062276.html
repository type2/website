Subject: Re: '68 bus tranny question

&gt;I am constantly arguing with my acquaintances about the '68 tranny!  I say
&gt;it's &gt;a swingaxle, but others tell me IRS.

It's IRS. In a swinging axle, the angle of the driveshaft on the hub end
cannot change; there is one CV joint per axle, at the transmission. In IRS,
there are two CVs per axle, and it can pivot at the hub end as well as the
at the trans end.

Look and see; you've got two CV boots per axle, four total.
