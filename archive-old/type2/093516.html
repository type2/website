Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy

some buses came with a space saver spare that the sides folded in on when 
it was deinflated.  once inflated, it was normal size.  I had one and 
simply took if off the rim and put a conventional tire on it.  greg

&gt;someone please explain how you &quot;fold&quot; a spare tire... i am very
&gt;confused... ok, so that isnt hard, but i cant imagine a usable tire being
&gt;folded up...
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
