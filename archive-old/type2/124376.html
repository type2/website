Subject: 77 Riviera Wiring Schematic

Hey all,

I'm trying to get my '77 Riviera's accessory battery system put back together.
The PO did a good job of labeling most of what he disconnected, but there are
some loose terminated wires floating around in my engine compartment that I'd
like to find homes for.  Does anyone on the list have a schematic for a '77
Riviera with the 12/110 fridge and furnace?  I don't have any frame of
reference for how this stuff should have looked when it was new, and I'm
concerned I'll do more harm than good if I start trying to sort it out blind.

Also, where would the inverter and battery meter have been mounted?  I'm
missing some items, most notably the coleman furnace and the original exhaust
including heater boxes, but besides that I'm sure the PO parted out some other
items as well.

Regarding the missing items, I've got an angle on a complete exhaust, but was
also wondering if I should even try to get another coleman furnace, or just
save my pennies for a newer furnace.

Thanks in advance!

Cody
