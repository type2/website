&gt; I agree with the majority of what you say. Enhancement of function is a

can't really disagree with you there

BUT

&gt; All a quality product needs to provide is

if you believe that I have a bridge in Brooklyn, a VHS VCR, or Microsoft

&gt; Neandereers don't think you should drink while driving. They put the cup

&gt; US Yuppies buyers in too big a hurry to pull over and park so they can eat
&gt; safely and use the open glove box lid as designed for sensible, safe,
&gt; rational behavior. Let's see, burger in left hand, fries in lap, coke in
&gt; cup holder. Steer with right hand until the cell phone rings, then steer
&gt; with left elbow while cussing the guy slowing you down up ahead. You just
&gt; can't do that without a cup holder.

you think that's fun,  I do it while driving with &quot;hand controls!&quot;
