&amp;quot;Thanks for the  idea.  Looks easy and cheap.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;I like my cologne the same as my women; cheap and strong.  And if they 
smell better that a horse whats been rode hard and put away wet, well, I 
consider that extra...&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Stop this foolishness and get bact to some serious VW bus discussion. So, 
when John Anderson mentions in 2001 'I think it was just VW paranoia or 
constant improvement mentality basically.  In '78 there are a bunch of 
sudden changes.  Westies (and maybe all buses?) get an insulation mat 
underneath the gas tank,' is that insulation mat ASBESTOS??&amp;quot;  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;  I think I 
feel a FART coming on, so I have to leave you now. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
