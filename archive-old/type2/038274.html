Subject: Make a Pilot Bearing Puller - Plan B: Hydraulic!

I was very impressed, awed in fact, by the ingenuity embodied by a pilot
bearing removal method that migrated (as far as I know) across the border
from Mexico - land of sparse tools and resources and therefore long on
inventiveness. Miguel Castellano taught us this trick while I was learning
the ropes at Gandalf's Garage in South San Francisco:

We used a sawed off transmission input shaft, but any piece of solid steel
which fits the inside diameter (13mm?) of the pilot bearing will do. Get a
handful of toilet paper and soak it in oil - any oil will do, engine oil is
fine. Proceed to pack the oil-soaked TP into the bearing hole. Pack it till
you can't get any more in, using a screwdriver, a stick, whatever. Pack it
in tight. Take the pilot shaft, or whatever substitute you're using, and
pound it into the hole, preferably with a large hammer. We used a five pound
sledge. Don't be bashful - be Bash-ful! Hit it hard. You'll be thrilled (as
I was) to see the bearing come popping out, farther with each blow.

Simple, effective, beautiful! What's happening, of course, is that hydraulic
pressure is built up by the hammer blows as the toilet paper acts like
packing or wadding to plug the gaps in the bearing and around the shaft. In
effect you are creating, and operating, a hydraulic ram applying (my guess)
several tons of pressure behind the bearing, which has no where to go, as
the ram goes in, but out - and so it does.

The case where this does NOT work is when the needle rollers have
disintegrated, or when someone has already buggered the bearing to the point
where the toilet paper packing can't fill the gaps...

Have fun -

If you can't find the special puller...&lt;snip&gt;
