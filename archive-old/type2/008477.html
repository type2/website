Subject: Something broke...
Date: Mon, 1 Mar 1999 22:41:58 -0800
Importance: Normal

As I was driving to a theatre audition this evening something went terribly,
terribly wrong with the &quot;Big Boy&quot;.  Coming off the freeway, I downshifted
into third gear, decelerating toward the stop light.  I pushed the in clutch
to drop down to second,then as I clutched out, I heard/felt something like a
&quot;pop&quot; and my stick went slack (no euphemism intended).  I was still in gear
(presumably third), but I now had no
ability to shift; the stick could be moved into any position (including
reverse) with the clutch out, and no effect.

I managed to limp into the theatre parking lot, where by luck an employee
and fellow type 2 owner happened to be just leaving work.  He gave me the
number of a local mechanic whom I called, and who will be taking a look
tomorrow, but when I described what had happened, he wasn't immediately
certain of the cause, or didn't want to commit to a diagnosis without first
examining the patient.

Soooo, my question is:  Given the symptoms as described above, am I looking
at something fairly simple, say a broken or disconnected linkage? Or could
something more serious be going on?  I should also note, that the clutch was
just rebuilt less than two months ago; the pedal action still feels normal.
I also had the transmission adjusted to specs at the same time.

Anybody got any idea what I'm dealing with here?
