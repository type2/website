Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Blues.... 



I've ordered many times from bus depot &amp; sometimes I get the parts right
away, sometimes it takes awhile.   Like anything, if you know you're going
to need a part, order it in advance!  I have sheet metal that's been
sitting in my house for 1-2 years &amp; now finally this summer will be welded.
I have no worries about getting the parts on time, since I already have
them.  Nobody's perfect &amp; yes I have been a little mad at times because I
didn't get my order right away; but then again if I would have ordered it a
week earlier or spent a few more $ for priority mail I would have had it
sooner.  In the end, I'll continue buying through bus depot, the price is
right. : )

just my thoughts,
Keri
