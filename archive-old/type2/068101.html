Subject: Re: '78 VW type2 gas heater

&gt; The problem with my heater is that when I turn it on it blows cold
&gt; air for a few minutes then trips a circuit breaker under the dash
&gt; and quits. Both fans seem to work OK.

Hi Joe,
  I assume that you are talking about the gas heater. It has 
something called a flame switch which shuts off the unit if the 
temperature in the heater does not get hot within a few minutes. If 
you are getting cold air, it must be because either the fuel pump 
(for the gas heater) isn't pumping fuel, or the ignition isn't firing 
it. 
  You can usually hear the fuel pump. It makes a ticking sound about 
once per second. If the pump is working, and there is no flame, then 
it isn't igniting. Usually, you can also hear the flame in the heater 
when it comes on, or you can check the heater exhaust on the left 
side of the bus to see if it is getting warm. If you smell unburned 
gas, be real careful! The safety shuts off the unit by tripping the 
circuit breaker to be SURE that it goes off if there is no flame.
   I have a manual for the Type 3 gas heater which pretty much 
applies to the one on my 78 Type 2. If you want, I can fax some pages 
to you. Just E-mail me your fax number. It will have to be tomorrow 
afternoon, as the manual is home, and the fax is here at work.
