I keep seeing want posts for these and I reply privately but never get a
response.  So, I'll post it to the list and see what happens:

I have available the child's hammock (the correct, Westy term, btw) from my
68.  I will even send the window pillar brackets if they differ from year to
year.  I don't have kids and my dogs are too heavy to use this.

I'm in CA and can ship via UPS.
