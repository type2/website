Hey folks,
 A funny Friday bus-related story.

I have a small flock of guinea fowl out at my place.  Today, I brought 4
6-week old guineas in to work with me to sell/trade to another guinea
enthusiast.  Unfortunately, she didn't show up on time, so I was stuck
with four boxed up and upset guineas 35 miles from home!   What to do?

  My bus just happened to be parked nearby so I popped the top, put in
the screens, cranked open the jalousies and gave these 4 young-uns one
heck of a nice bird cage.  While a bit concerned about the poop-factor,
I'm not too worried...those vinyl seats are scrubbable and are no stranger
to good ol' Simple Green cleaner.

Catching them is going to be a hoot.
