Subject: 74 T2 1.8 liter head: best way to block FI sensor port

I apparently got a 1.8 liter cylinder head designed for fuel injectors, so there is an angled hole that goes straight into head, and hence compression chamber, on the left side.  I've blocked it off several times, but not doing it correctly obviously, cause over the years it inevitably works loose. 

Anyone know what size bolt (diameter, length, and thread size) I can block it off permanently with?  The head is in the bus, so I can't remove it to do the modification.
