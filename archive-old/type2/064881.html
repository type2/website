She's doing her thing as a driving bus.    I changed the oil, in addition to
what I wrote about the other day, and she starts right up, and drives better.
 Today saw an alignment, which only cost $30.  It was pretty off, as the tir
rod had been replaced.   Hopefully this will improve the gas milage.
  Somehow I ended up with four differnt tires on it.  It used to have a
matched pair in the front, and a matched pair in the back. But  I had had two
flats, one on the front and one on the back, and now all is funky.

Went to the lock shop, and they are going to cut me keys new from code, and
possibly will have a blank for the steering lock, but the German key board
had fallen over when they moved, so it is a little chaotic.  I showed they
guy the steering lock (installed in bus), and he admired the bus.   Oh my,
even in that less than pretty state.  Everyone loves a splitty.

But the dash looks much better.  :)   and she glows with life.   Or whatever
you call it.  The personality of the bus comes out with a little attention
and TLC.

So, I think we'll attempt the first trip tomorrow, up to Seattle, about 150
miles round trip with the driving around town.  Wish us luck!!!!
