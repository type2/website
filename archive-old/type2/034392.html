Subject: RE: Exhaust Leaks on a 72

There are several causes (or contributing factors) to this leak.  First of
all, I am dealing with this same problem myself (on a '72).  Before you try
to correct the problem, you need to have EVERY piece of engine tin and both
heat exchanger support brackets must be in place.  These heat exchangers are
held onto the head by only 4 nuts (and they are not that big).  The support
brackets (one is part of the alternator bracket, and the left side attaches
to the fan shroud-I think).  Without these brackets, and the associated
engine tin, the heat exchangers WILL vibrate loose.  Another major point is
to make sure the rear engine support pieces-the rubber ones, are intact.
With all this stuff in good shape, do the following:

Remove the heat exchangers.  Lay a straight edge on the pipes that attach to
the head.  Both pips MUST be flat, and in the same plane.  You will have to
remove the exhaust gaskets (copper gaskets).  These will probably be stuck
in the head, right above where the pipes go into the head.  If the leak has
been there long, one or more of the gaskets will be damaged or missing.
Install new gaskets, install the heat exchangers, and put everything back
together.

Some folks will enlarge the holes in the heat exchangers where the head
studs go through.  This makes it easier to move the heat exchanger around a
bit to insure a tight, sound fit.  If you don't get a TIGHT fit, and keep it
tight with the brackets and engine tin, you leak WILL come back to haunt
you.

You might want to buy some brass (or whatever, but not steel) nuts to go on
the exhaust studs.  Be VERY careful when tightening the exhaust studs.  If
you make them too tight, you WILL pull one out of the head.

Good luck,

&gt; 
&gt; I have an exhaust leak around the heads where the heater box mounts. I
&gt; have heard this is a common problem, but have not heard of a way to fix
&gt; the leak. Also is this something that will hurt the engine if I can't
&gt; get the leak fixed.
&gt; Thanks
