Hi Volks,

Its been a productive 4 months since I acquired the 71.

I have begun the process of building a motor from scratch and have acquired
the case, crank, and cam so far.  I also bought a Dial Indicator and
Calipers.  This motor will have all TLC items that keep 'em running longer:
thermostat, flaps, Hoover bit, all tin, vacuum distributor(Waaay smoother
than my 009), and CDI Ignition and anything else I think of b4 the end of
the year.

Swapped out the motor (beetle) for the bus motor in the 68 after installing
.020 shims on all 4 cylinders - the pistons are non-dished or flat and the
engine was running warmer than I like.  The beetle motor is not well - I can
turn the crank and there is very little resistance from compression.

Replaced one caliper and both front rubber brake lines and now the only
problem with the brakes is a rough feeling pedal - kinda like the gaskets in
the master cylinder are rubbing wrong.  Anybody had this before?  I am not
too good with brakes...

Will be replacing the pop-top seal and canvas, the old canvas rips when you
unzip the screens.  Can anybody recommend a replacement seal source, like
the original?  I'll prolly get the canvas from VW Canvas in TX.

Inside, the fridge needs a new handle - got that but do not know how to get
at the screws that are behind the magnetic seal and inner door piece.  Has
anybody out there ever done this?

There are rips in the vinyl seats, none longer than 1 inch.  Is there a way
to repair these?  I once saw a kit advertised on TV but haven't seen it for
a while.

Hope to see some of you at Auburn Hills, MI on 5/17 for the VOA show.

Thanks,
