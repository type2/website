Subject: Re: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

Yes, the bus generator is longer.
Yes, the tin plate that mounts the generator to the shroud is special, it is
dished.
Yes, you can bolt on a Bosch or Motorola internal regulator using the tin
plate you have now. If you had the dished bus one, it would not work.
You will need to replace the stand and the fuel pump and the fuel pump push
rod.
Or, I have a good 71 bus only generator with the correct dished plate since I
just converted to alternator on my 67 bus......



&gt; My first post: Here it goes:
&gt;
&gt; I bought a 71 Westy 2 months ago, I noticed in tightening the generator belt
&gt; on my first maiden voyage that it seemed odd the generator pulley was not in
&gt; line with the crankshaft pulley. I think the generator might be a bug
&gt; generator as the Bosch number on it is 113 903 031P. Can anyone confirm this
&gt; for me ? I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
&gt; amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in
&gt; the bus....
&gt;
&gt; I've already bought spare belts just in case.... Has anyone had luck
&gt; converting to a alternator on a 71?
