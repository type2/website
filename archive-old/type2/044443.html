take out the .009 distributor and put in the correct one, or if you do
have the correct vacuum distributor in there, check to see that the vacuum
chamber is not leaking

&gt; Here are the stats..
&gt; '78 Westfalia, 2.0 liter FI..naturally.
&gt; I take off in first gear just fine, but when I grab 2nd it hesitates bad, 
&gt; almost dies, but if I toss it in 3rd and lug it, it goes. As soon as I'm up 
&gt; to speed it's fine. It only does this after I've come to a stop. Idles fine. 
&gt; I've done everything within my own power ie; plugs, wires, cap, rotor, 
&gt; points, fuel filter.all cylinders are within specs as far as compression 
&gt; goes. The only thing I couldn't do was check my fuel pressure....I don't have 
&gt; the guage for it. I eliminated all of the easy stuff. If anyone has had a 
&gt; similar problem and fixed it, I'd love to hear about it.
