Subject: have to keep push starting/ignition switch prob???

howdy all :O)

 I'm havin a prob with my ignition switch on my 78
bus. It seems as when I go on long trips, such as the
one I just took, my bus wont start by turnin the key.
I replaced the starter before I drove down to St.Pete,
FL a couple days ago and it still is havin trouble and
its a pain in the ass tryin to push start the thing on
flat grounds. Up in NC it wasnt a big deal :O) But if
anyone could help me out on this one I would really
appreciate it. I went and bought an ignition switch
but am clueless of the procedure of puttin it in. Do I
have to pull the whole steering column off?? Help me
out here ..... :O)


 Heidi
