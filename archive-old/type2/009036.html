Al, thanks for the replies - unfortunately I will be (hopefully) starting
the engine Sunday not leaving enough time to get the &quot;sermons&quot;.  If
anybody would like to p-mail me the advice I will buy the &quot;SERMONS&quot; 
later.  Promise, the company I work form makes all its money from
royalties so I am verry sensitive on this issue.

&gt;John and Tom:
&gt;You really ought to get a copy of Hoover's &quot;Sermons&quot;!
&gt;He does quite a masterful job of laying out what to do in these critical
first minutes of your engines new life. Too much for me to reiterate
after a long day. And besides, he deserves the royalties after paying
dues so many years. This guy has built VW aircraft engines. That's where
reliability takes on a whole new meaning.
&gt;Bus Depot has &quot;Sermons&quot;
