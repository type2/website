Subject: BN 4 GAS HEATER

Hello people,

I have a BN 4 gas heater in my 72 van.
I found out that the fuse holder wire was loose and I had it running
with the fuel pump tickin and the fan a blowin.
After about 2-3 minutes it shuts off.
I go to take a look and find out that this little red 'reset button?' that is
on the gas heater
has tripped. I can push the 'reset' button and it will come back to life.

The question is - what would cause this reset button to trip and what do I
need to do
to stop it from trippin? so it will stay on for longer than 2-3 minutes?

Thanks y' all
Darren
