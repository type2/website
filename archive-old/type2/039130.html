&gt; dave russel and kelly who told me to check my
&gt; electromagnetic idle cut-off valve(big thanks).  
&gt; when
&gt; i got home i unscrewed it part of the way and my
&gt; idle
&gt; came right up.   thanks everyone for all the help,
&gt; im
&gt; now in search for a replacement.   as a side note,
&gt; this valve originally had  a wire connected to it
&gt; which i understand its function, but it has not been
&gt; connected for about a year and ive never had idling
&gt; problems before?  

Ummm...if it hasn't even been hooked up, how do you
know that it needs replacing??? I don't know on a '73,
but on my '69, the wire goes from the cut-off, to the
electric choke-solenoid, and then to the
coil....probably the same, but you should find out for
sure.

One other note, I recently checked prices on these
little buggers (mine's bad) and found Bus Depot to
have them at about 1/3 the cost of my local FLAPS for
my brosol 30/31 POC (Piece-Of-Crap;-) carb. You might
check 'em out.
