I'll add my comments to the mix...

I like the idea.  On a bug the FI seems a little bit crammed in there, but
with a bus it would seem OK to manage.

All new VW's in Mexico are sold this way as I understand it.  Also the guys
in the UK who are getting Brazilian Type2's are also getting them with
1600cc FI engines (see the Devon camper report from a couple of weeks back).

Which leads to an observation... the systems are still being produced!  I've
already written http://www.beetlemex_dot_com/ to see if he has any idea of a FI
system can be purchased on a &quot;turn key longblock&quot; -- like what they sell in
the cars.

At what price would a new FI system be worth the investment?  Say $1000 for
a complete system (without heads)?  Obviously there is a pretty good
increase in MPG, and you have to also consider that a new 34-pict3 is around
$150 too...

One question:  As I understand it the, the later bugs had different heat
exchangers.  Was this design change to accommodate FI system or for some
other reason?  I know you need different mufflers for FI, is there a
suitable one with FI accommodations that would fit on a '63-71 bus?

I have a question but I don't mean to start a flame war. ;-)  With all the
supporters of fuel injection out there, how come no one has a fuel injected
1600 in their bus?  VW has had a number of fuel injected 1600s in the type 3
and later beetles.  It seems that with all the frustration out there over
the
34 PICT 3 carbs someone would have tried to transplant a FI system from a
beetle or type 3.  I understand that the FI system on those engines is only
meant for &quot;stock&quot; type engines.  That is it should be a 1600 and not
anything
larger and it should run a stock cam and exhaust (probably, don't know).
How
about it?  Is this a totaly lame idea?  Inquiring minds want to know.

I'm breaking my own rule here about &quot;better to remain silent and be thought
a
fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt&quot;.  Any discussion?
