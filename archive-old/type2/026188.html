Last night I was over at a friend's house looking through a big stash of
parts he recently acquired.  A lot of it is '70s vintage and he has a little
of everything.  One piece he showed me has to be of particular interest to
one of you out there.  Its one piece of the 3 color stripe package for a
dark brown mid to late '70s Bus.  The stripes are 3 shades of brown with one
of them being a kind of rust color.  I'm sure you've all seen one of these
particular Busses before, I just don't know late bay windows that well to
know what option package that would be from.  This particular piece is
pretty long so I'm guessing its probably for the quarter panel but could be
cut for use elsewhere if you need it.  If you're interested here's the email
address: Kelly.McCaw_at_corp.palm_dot_com
