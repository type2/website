Subject: Spark Plug Blowout

The rest of the story ends with a trip to find a heli (not sure of the
spelling) coil and the tools to
install it with. I got weird looks at the autozone and other little part
store in the area. I ended up renting a Uhaul to my baby home. Now heres my
questions. 1. What caused this type thing to happen? 2. What other damage
could come from this? 3. Whats the best fix now that she is home in the

I don't know what caused it to happen, but it can probably be repaired with
the heli-coil kit. I've used them successfully. It's MUCH easier if you pull
the motor
to do this. The kit won't be at auto-zone. You will find it at a descent
foreign Auto Parts house, the same type of place that would carry metric
hardware.

The kit comes with a thread chaser and a series of various size inserts. It
may come with cement. I would also buy a tube of loc-tite as well. You use
your spark plug wrench on the chaser to create/tap new threads, put an
insert on the spark plug, coat the outer part of the insert with loc-tite
(not too much) then carefully screw it in. It's easy to get off center.
Better done with engine out from straight above. Works best with head bolted
to engine like a vise. Let the loc-tite dry and then remove plug and check
it out. Sometimes the insert will come out the plug thereafter, depending on
how well it seals, then you have to use a new insert with a new plug. If the
hole is too big and deformed for the insert, at least the motor is out and
the head can be R&amp;R'd
