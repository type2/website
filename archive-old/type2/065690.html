Great! We anxiously await your results!

On the same topic - I am thinking of installing an in-line blower in the
heating system of my '71 Westy - they have nice ones from West Marine
for around $30. 

Questions:

1) What diameter is the heating pipe forward? The blowers are available
in 3&quot; and 4&quot; models...

2) Do you have to make it a recirculator in order to use a blower? I
worry some about what is happening if you have a blower going sucking
air over the fan and out the back when the engine is at idle...

3) If you do make it a recirculator, where to you run the hoses through
the firewall? under the rear seat? Straight up to the engine lid?

'Course, this is all jumping the gun, since Matt is going to tell us how
by using a 2' x 2' piece of foam core and a few sheet metal screws we
can increase the heat output to 25,000 BTU! ;)

Just noticed that it's cold out,

Anton
