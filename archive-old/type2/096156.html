&gt; I agree that some of the sears tools aren't always the best available, even

and I have a complete set of Ward's Power Kraft wrenches that have given
me over 25 years of good service, only ever had to return one under
warranty and they swapped it out right away no questions asked, of course
I didn't realize the &quot;Lifetime&quot; warranty meant &quot;life of the store&quot;
