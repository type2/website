I consider having a bicycle hanging off the back of my bus to be 
necessary emergency equipment, second only to a fire extinguisher.

Pick-your-part places often have bikes for cheap; I got a Raleigh 
mountain bike in perfectly good condition for $14. I put an 
eye-catching seat on it and left the quick release in place: it's a 
sacrificial item for someone bent on mischief. In the two years my bus 
was on city streets and public parking lots, nobody ever bothered to 
steal it!
