&gt;Having never attempted a valve job before and with Muir as my guide I am
&gt;guessing that one turn means to tighten the valves all the way then back
&gt;off one full turn. No use of feeler gauges.
&gt;
&gt;Is this a correct assumption?

No, you need to tighten them all the way and then one additional turn.
After you do this, the lifters will bleed down and the clearance will go
from negative 1 turn to zero.  The hydraulic lifers have a certain range of
operation and the 1-turn-in procedure is designed to put the lifter on the
safe side of the center of that range.

Muir, bless his heart, didn't say much about hydraulic lifters since they
didn't come out in VW engines until 1978.
