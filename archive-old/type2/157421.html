Subject: Re: Shipping doors across the country

The best and cheapest way to send oversized parts is Greyhound. Its done 
on a space available basis but I've found stuff gets there really 
quickly. I've shipped a number of large body parts all over the country 
and never had a complaint. Just make sure you pack them well with solid 
foam, rolled up cardboard, wadded up paper, etc. No pellets for anything 
large and/or heavy. And make 2 packages so they're easier to handle.

I need to ship these across the country.  Anyone
have experience doing this?  Wondering about the
cheapest method and how they should be packaged. 
They are too big for a pallet.
