&gt; &gt;Flywheel system:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The idea is a flywheel ( a wheel with very large mass, much larger than the
&gt; &gt;flywheel currently in your bus) stores energy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As it now exists, a high-efficiency gas turbine produces electricity.  This
&gt; &gt;juice is used to speed up the flywheel(to very, very high rpm) and to turn
&gt; &gt;electric motors which turn the wheels at cruising speeds.  When you step on
&gt; &gt;the accelerator, both the turbine and the flywheel generate plenty o' amps

A number of years ago, this was proposed in an article produced by one 
of the CA colleges. It was demonstrated in Popular Mechanics in the 80s. 
I think it was LA that did a study into the feasibility of putting these 
systems into specially designed busses. The idea was that they'd pull 
into specially designed charging stations (electric) to run the flywheel 
back up to speed.

The big drawback to using these in cars is their flywheel effect. Once 
in motion, they don't want to turn, except on their axis. If they are 
mounted on their side, it stops the car from &quot;leaning&quot; into a turn. 
Mounted upright, the car resists cornering.

Another problem is in bearing design. Flywheels turn several thousand 
RPM (300K, as I recall). Imagine what would happen if even the slightest 
vibration was introduced into this setup... such as a bearing seizure, 
or an accident.
