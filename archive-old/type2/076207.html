Subject: Re: [T2] Bodywork Question

Hi Volks,

I've removed this part from 4 different rusty Ontario buses, and the way
that has worked for me is with a 12&quot; length of 1x4, slipped UNDER the cover
so it will apply force as closely as possible to the slot where the cover is
binding.

Whack the board, move forward 6&quot;, give it another whack. Keep moving along
the cover from end to end working back and forth, and eventually it will let
loose.

With the buses I've dismantled the screws almost always break as they're
coming apart. One trick I've found is to TIGHTEN the screws very slightly
before trying to loosen them, this will break the corrosion without
stripping the threads you need to back the screw out. It's a technique that
also helps with rounded out engine tin screws.


Happy trails,

&gt; I had a tough problem getting the passenger side cover off my bus.  The trick
&gt; for me was to use a 2x4 and a rubber mallet to knock it off.  Put the 2x4
&gt; lengthwise against the bottom of the cover and give it several knocks with the
&gt; rubber mallet.

&gt; there...........
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting The Duck ready for a paint job later this month. I've been
&gt; stripping her down. I took off the center runner cover behind the sliding
&gt; door. No problems; it turned out to be a pretty easy job. However, I am
&gt; running in to problems with the runner cover on the DRIVER side. There is no
&gt; sliding door on this side, but a cover is used on this side also. I managed
&gt; to get the three screws out from the bottom. But this thing will not budge.
&gt; Doesn't even wiggle. I know it cannot have the same screw driven pressure
&gt; mechanism holding it in place as the sliding door side cover. So, what
&gt; gives? How do I get this cover out?
&gt; 
&gt; Sure would appreciate some input on this one.
