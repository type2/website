Subject: a note on replacing the fuel tank sender

Dear Volks,

The '74-'79 VW bus shop manual
(http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/images/VW-90.4.jpg) shows how you can cut
into the rear deck for direct access to the fuel tank sender. (Yes, it's a
trade-off, but I wasn't going to pull the engine to pull the firewall to
pull the tank, which, knowing myself, would have lead to a complete engine
rebuild. :)  The key, I think, is in doing a *neat*, clean job.)

For the record, I just wanted to point out three things:

(1) The &quot;lid&quot; part of the '73-'79 sender has a 3-5/8&quot; diameter, hence will
not fit through the hole if it is cut to the smaller dimensions given in the
manual. (This also means that the non-availability of the VW cover plate
shown in the manual is irrelevant to '73-'79 busses.) I went ahead and cut a
3&quot; x 4&quot; rectangle.

(2) There is a fair amount of room between the rear deck and the sender,
thus allowing the use of an electric saber saw (set to medium speed) to cut
the hole without cutting into the fuel tank, too. Obviously you must use a
short blade for metal. For easy gliding of the saber saw, I oiled the deck
surface. The oil will also help cool the blade, prolong its life, as well as
bind the small metal particles.

(3) Finally use a vacuum cleaner to remove shavings and most of 20+ years
worth of dirt sitting on the tank and sender. Wipe everything clean with a
wet rag. Now you can remove the old sender and install the new one.
