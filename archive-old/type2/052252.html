Subject: [T2] I DEMAND SATISFACTION ! ! 

A great feeling of satisfaction to get the second brake drum off the '72.

Much (and I do mean MUCH) banking with a 3 lb hammer, and a lot verbal abuse 
(man, it was the wife yelling about all the noise at 10 PM last night) and 
it finally came off.

Just needed to share this on friday.

Barry sends  '78 Westy  &amp; '72 Westy &amp; '74 (Volvo)
