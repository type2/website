Hi folks,
Looks like I'm finally on the right list, I've got a 82 aircooled van with
an Australian &quot;trakka&quot; camping conversion.
I've just pulled out of the Vanagon list, where I received lots of help from
the guys, but that list is more oriented to watercooled vans.
Tried to pull out the inner core of my speedo cable to lube it, but it
wouldn't come. I've done this several times with other vehicles. Is it
&quot;do-able&quot; with an 82 Vanagon?
TIA
Geoff
