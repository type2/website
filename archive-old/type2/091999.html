Subject: T2 -75 spare tire holder removal

Hi all from Stockholm, Sweden,
I'm having problems removing the spare tire front holder on my -75 bus
(for cleaning purposes). The two lower mounting bolts w/ nut attached to
the front bumper are no problem, however, the two bolts holding it to
the front, located right under the air intakes just rotate with no
screwing/unscrewing action at all. Like there's A) a nut on the other
side or B) they're welded to the inside and the welding's come off.
Accessing from the other side is a minor project since it involves
removing the dashboard, and the air intake ducts (!). Smart
construction  (NOT). Maybe if someone's encountered the same problem
they could save me some time
Another thing is the engine, which is a -79 2l one that doesn't have the
injection system but dual carbs.. is this common or not? Should I
replace the carbs or keep 'em? Runs great. Got this bus quite recently
(2 months ago) for $200 (which was a bargain in my opinion) ... am quite
new to the list, but have already learned a lot by VieWing. Keep it up
lads and gals,
Tobias from Sweden

-75 T2 w/ -79 2.0 l engine (&quot;Big Joan&quot;)
