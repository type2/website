X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&lt;snip&gt;And And glove compartment interior. 
 . Anyone got one?
                            Al
 &lt;/snip&gt;

If you have the old one you can make a new one via the
paper mache method.
  Line the old one with saran wrap. Shred cardboard or
newspaper and put it in a bucket of water till it is mush.
Spread the mush over the saran wrap in the old one then let
dry (in the sun if available). After it is dry smooth with
light sanding if desired... spray with clear seal or krylon
paint (gray looks good). You can use either the inside or
the outside surface for your &quot;mold&quot; process. If you use the
outside surface then the inside surface of your &quot;new&quot; liner
will be smoother... paint both sides of the new liner to
keep it from absorbing water... this also helps the
structural strength. I actually modified mine a bit to make
for a bigger liner. just a bit harder to get in place was
all. Ah yes, then I sprayed glue on the inside interior and
lined it with cloth.
 If your old one is real beat up make temp repairs with
duct tape to allow it to be used as a mold.
