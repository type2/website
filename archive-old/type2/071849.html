  Thank you all for your terrific advice and support recently, as I tried to
get Ramona to ignore the light and return to the land of the living.
  After replacing many things and testing almost everything, we not only found
the problem, but also learned *a lot* about 'Mona's guts and their workings.
  You may remember my &quot;Crank, Spit, Nada&quot; post. After all the tests and
replacements, we finally deduced there was simply no spark. We'd looked at the
points and sanded them and cleaned them all up and they looked good from what
you can see in that position, and after cleaning them we tested them w/ the
timing light and got the light to go off once (!), but then she stayed on
again.
  So we just yanked the points anyway and there was the rub! Pocked little
pits on either side of the moveable point!! So the points were staying closed
all that time!
  Yay!! Replaced the points and ole Ramona fired up with a happy vengeance!!!!
  Only problem was we did not replace the condenser, but only because we
didn't have a small enough stubby to get behind the dizzy at the screw. I
know, I know, bread and butter, but that I'll try on Monday. I'm just so
thrilled she fired!
  Also on Monday, we will finish up the basics of a tune up, starting with my
first engine-in valve adjustment. So, QUESTION: do all of you replace your
valve covers, and if so, what type of gasket sealant do you use?? And this is
applied to the valve cover only, right??
  The final job, unfortunately, will belong to an actual mechanic!! We have
tried to take apart and replace the wiper motor (after greasing it up), and
cannot get it back together!! That job's worse then replacing the voltage reg.
for the first time! So, unless any of you have some more miracle advice, I'll
PAY to see that fixed!
  Listen, really, thanks again and again! I cannot wait to get her on the road
once more, where she belongs, and I feel really great and empowered that I
didn't have to bring her to a mechanic to tell me the points were shot!
  By the way, Dave, the heat is after the tune up and I'll be in touch!!!!
  Immense gratitude all, and again, any advice on the valve covers and/or
wipers is appreciated! Mona-Girl is grinnin' again thanks to you*
Rachel &amp; Ramona
