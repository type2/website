Hi Volks,

Recently I did a complete brake job on my 79 Transporter.  This included
replacing the rear drums which I felt were to thin after being turned at a
local machine shop.  Since the refurnishing the brake pedal has been hard,
but the brakes have been working very well.  In fact there has been a couple
of times that I have had to make emergency stops (other drivers).  In the
past two days, I have noticed that when I begin to start  braking, the pedal
is some what hard, then goes into a soft stage and the pedal actually goes
down a bit.  The braking action is still good.  Just the hardness that was
once there is no more. If you double pump the brake pedal the above action
does not take place.  The bus still has good braking action.  There are no
fluid leaks that I can tell, and there is no fluid missing from the master
cylinder.  Oh, by the way, the master cylinder and the two rear wheel
cylinders were also replaced during this overall.

Anyone got an idea whats going on??
