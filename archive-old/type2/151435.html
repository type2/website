Hi John,

I did the same with the westfakia back in spring 2001. I pulled the  
windows, sliding door trim, bumpers, door handles, etc.

The $400CDN paint they applied is still holding up well. I think the  
trick with Maaco (or other budhet-minded paint shops) is to deliver  
them as little prep work as possible. Because that is precisely what  
they plan to do regardless.  *some* of the time they save in prep  
*might* get spent in getting better results in the spray; but that's  
probably just wishful thinking.

The fact that you do your own prep does tell the paint shop that you  
are an informed consumer and they're going to be less likely to try  
and pass off a substandard job if they think that way.

Happy trails,

A local club member was familiar with Toyota's specs on vehicle
assembly. The time from pre-paint acid dip to paint was in seconds due
to immediate rust formation. We took a bus to Maaco with a combination
of OG paint and primer and they didn't charge any extra for it.
