&gt; &gt;  Has anyone done this replacement WITHOUT removing the whole column as
&gt; advised by this article? The article in the tech writeup section makes it
&gt; look rather daunting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I just happen to have opened this can of worms,,, I have a column in front
&gt; of me...out of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Taking the column apart isn't that tough... just time consuming..
&gt;
&gt; I can tell you,, that &quot;grub&quot; screw is behind the steel tube of the column,,
&gt; and your not getting the switch out unless you want to destroy parts

oh fun... can you do it without drilling out the pin etc.

no wonder I couldn't see the screw
