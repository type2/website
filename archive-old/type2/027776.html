following up on my engine making knocking sounds on my way to work:

I pulled the valve covers off at lunch and everything looked perfect.  Oil 
level is ok.  pushrods and heads are all ok looking. everything looked 
pretty normal.  So I started it up and it started good.  sounded good.  I 
drove it about a mile and didn't hear anything like I did in thise morning.  
I did still have less power than before.

Note:  I got a new carb put on (professionally) on monday.  i'm wondering if 
the mechanic didn't set the fuel mixture right.  if it is too lean, would 
that cause engine temps to go up causing noises like I heard this morning?  
the noises I heard this morning were not constant with the engine 
revolutions.  it was very uneven and spiratic.  There was no change when I 
gave it gas.

I'm going to attempt to drive home on side streets.  If I hear the noise I 
will just pull over.  it seems it only occurs when temps are up.

I'm assuming if it was a serious problem(engine interior) I would have heard 
the noise upon start up.
Any ideas or advice?
