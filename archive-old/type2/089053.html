Subject: T2b front end needs stiffening?

Hello all,=20

Finished chopping up the rusted out '79 DC today, and it had one, last, =
surprise for me.

Can anyone think of a reason for a PO to weld a piece of pipe between =
the upper tube of the front beam, to the bodywork? The mounting bolts =
for the front beam were all fine, nothing out of the ordinary that I =
could see ( except that it had obviously been in an accident of some =
sort at some point, as there was a fair amount of bog (filler) down the =
driver's side, but the metal behind it was OK, and you couldn't tell it =
was there until you cut the panels, so I'm presuming that they got =
sideswiped, or something similar ).

Anyway, the only reason for this piece of pipe welded to the front beam =
is to stiffen it up, does anyone know of any problems in the late models =
('79), or trucks which would account for needing to stiffen up the front =
end? OR, does anyone know ( or can guess ) what it would have been for, =
OTHER than to stiffen it up?

Any ideas would be gratefully accepted.
