Subject: Re: [T2] powdercoating rims

If you are going to have your rims powder coated the coater has to use a 
powder primer. Also make sure you have the wheels blasted with something 
besides glass bead. The wheel needs to be somewhat rough for the powder to 
adhere to it well. Your best bet may be to find a place that will do the 
blasting so that they won't sit for a long time or be handled before they 
are powder coated.

&gt;
&gt;Just a quick question for those that have powdercoated your rims....  After
&gt;you have the wheels sandblasted do you etch prime the rims and then 
&gt;powdercoat
&gt;or just powdercoat?
&gt;
&gt;TIA
