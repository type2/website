&gt;The valve stayed put, looks like some of the guide got
&gt;mashed between the valve and the seat.  I'll try to
&gt;get some pics up this evening.

A picture is worth a lot of words.

&gt;Can you buy just 1 piston?  I'm half tempted to take
&gt;a chisel and/or grinder to this one and see what's left after removing
&gt;the flattened guide material.

No, please don't. Take it to to a vw machinist.
The Bentley manual has specs  They may all be worn out.

&gt; &gt;Does this mean that the entire engine (78 2.0 FI) needs to
&gt; be rebuilt?
&gt;
&gt; No. But you previously stated you had found metal
&gt; and a lot of sludge in the strainer, and that will require
&gt; case disassembly and inspection of bearings. So, Yes.

&gt;Well, the sludge was caked inside the strainer cap,
&gt;not in the strainer itself.

Yeah, Sure. Whatever. Want to buy some swamp land ?
Sludge does not confine itself to the strainer cover.
It's also in the oil cooler and much grit has gone
through the bearings and left damage there.

&gt; &gt;Another option is, I have a complete 1700 w/single Weber
&gt; &gt;with a purported broken crank, and another 1700 used longblock
&gt; &gt;(worked when last ran, no rings.)  I think I could take these
&gt; &gt;2 engines and make 1 pretty cheaply, maybe that will last me
&gt; &gt;until I can afford the AVP.
&gt;
&gt; Disassemble both cores and inventory good components.
&gt; Then price additional parts and survey your capabilities.
&gt; Do you really want to know how to build an engine ?

&gt; I'm a former
&gt;small engine mech, so I believe I'm capable, and have most of the
&gt;needed tools, just short on time and $$.

Find some time ( and $$ :).
