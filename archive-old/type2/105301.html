Subject: Re: [T2] Two tire mounts

&gt; There is a 3rd..... I don't know who made it. It mounts to the top of the
&gt; bumper and only uses two little
&gt; holes on the nose about an 1&quot; and a half apart, up near the bottom of the
&gt; emblem. All the weight of the tire
&gt; is on the bumper. The tire sits in the correct direction so you can put a
&gt; hubcap on it. The tire is away from
&gt; the nose. It is not homemade. I found it on the front of a 73. If anyone wants
&gt; pics of it, let me know. But I
&gt; have to find where I hid it

This kind right?

Besides the Euro westy that uses the box cover on the extended bumper, the
bull bars and custom ones another kind I'd never seen before popped up on
the Samba recently. Not very attractive:
