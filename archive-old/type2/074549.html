&gt; I'm new to the VW Bus world and need to know a few things.  A friend of mine
&gt; just gave me a 71' VW Bus.  I want to know how to find the engine and
&gt; transmission &quot;type&quot;.  The only reason I'm unsure is the engine looks like
&gt; it's had a lot of work done (aftermarket).  Is there anywhere I can
&gt; cross-ref engine block numbers?  Also, does anyone know if an
&gt; auto-transmission will work in a 71' Bus (I hate commuter traffic!)?

the auto tranny will only go (easly) onto a type IV engine
