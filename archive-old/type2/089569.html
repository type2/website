Subject: Why I cant stand people who dont drive VW's

Ok, since we are doing the why I hate and love my VW, I thought I would put my two cents in with why I cant stand people who dont drive VW's

10. The on your bumper driver who doesn't realize that your VW doen't go 80, and you wouldn't make it if it did. 

9. The &quot;whadda ya mean it doesn't have air?&quot; look you get from people who at some point thought it would be fun to take a ride. 

8. The fact that Joe Honda can go to the local pep boys and get virtually anything for his rice burner, while I have to beg them to order brake pads. 

7. When people say, &quot;Oh, you actually DRIVE that?&quot;

6. No, we're not all hippees, or high...get over it, that was the sixties. 

5. You get two civics side by side at the light. You think their going to wave or nod to each other?  Well, you're wrong. They will. Just before they take off, motors whining, to see who can beat who to the 16.5 second quarter mile in their &quot;Racecars&quot;. 

4. No, it's not a cult...you just wouldn't understand. 

3. No, I don't want to sell it. Do you see a For Sale sign in the window? 

2. OK, so maybe they are a bit temperamental, but you don't have to keep reminding me of that. Do I remind you you drive a box, like hundreds of thousands of others made with no personality? 

1. Always trying to explain to them why I have dirty fingernails!
