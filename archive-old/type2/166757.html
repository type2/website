Subject: Re: [T2] Backfire

Hi Max.  I signed off but couldn't stay away so here I am again.  I'm headed out on another cruise.  Won't be able to read all of the emails but will read the ones with interesting subject lines.  
   
  I had the same problem with my 1.7L.  It got better with correct timing and carb adjustment (running too rich) but I finally gave up on fixing it completely.  I solved the problem by accident when I found that I had an exhaust leak and fixed that.  That could very well be your problem too.  
   
  Good luck....KR

  Hello list members,

KK my '71 Westy is having a bit of a backfire problem. I recently
swapped engines and now when coming off WOT (85-95%) I get a nice pop
out of the tailpipe. I did a full tune-up this weekend, nothing much
needed adjusting but I still get the backfire. I have it timed at 29
degrees when at WOT. Less or more and I get a nice flame out the
tailpipe. This is a 1600dp, with a 30/31 carb, and a 009 distributor.

Any ideas?

Thank you,

Max
