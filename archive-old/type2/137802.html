Subject: Re: [T2] Someone please talk me out of pushing my bus off a
  cliff

The local VW dealer could suggest a shop that works on vintage VW (if
they don't themselves).

Tow trucks are high. You need a vehicle shipper. I had a westy brought
from NY to CA for $800. You find these kinds of deals on enthusiast
web sites. Do a google on old tractors or race cars. An independent
trucker will often give a very low price on the last empty slot on his
rig just so he won't make a trip with an empty slot.

Is there someone you could borrow a spare engine from? Or is there a
swap meet coming up in your area where you could buy a used one cheap?

Oh, and no permanent solutions to short term problems!

Good luck,

John

 I wonder if anyone in the Buffalo area knows of any
 place to have my bus professionally fixed so I can
 drive it home, or maybe the identity of someone who
 will tow it home for less than the $1,500.00 quotes I
 have received, or at least a nice tall cliff I can
 push it off with myself inside it.
