Subject: Re: cv joint socket size and ?s

jonathan,

could be either of 2 things, if hex it is simply 6mm hex head,
by a set from sears or Lilse? (in a lot of auto parts places,
ie Autozone, Advanced, Western Auto) is better value.  Now could
also be the &quot;triple square&quot; 12 point, this is not a Torx but is
a German sort of thing, you need an 8mm triple square (8mm being
the bolt size not the size of the socket).  Whitless sells a set
of 6, 8, 10 mm triple squares for about $10 (quality?).  I have
2 K-D tool models that I got at NAPA and Montgy Wards years ago
(only bought the second when I lost the first), Snap-On as well
for a source each tool should be less than $10 regardless I'd say.

Chances are its the 6mm hex and fits loose cause they're beat up.
On a bus its easy to get one's you screw up, simply rotate the bolt to
the bottom and apply vice-grips.  On Vanagons if you screw one up on
the outside you can be really SOL as they are deep in the trailing arm.
Before ever trying to loosen these things.

1. shoot with degreaser in head.
2. pick out all the crap with an awl, pick, etc, ALL OF IT.
3. shoot with degreaser again.
4. tap the appropriate socket in with a hammer, tap it 5-10
times to break up crud.
5. loosen em.

As a rule I seldom find penetrating oil needed although it can't
hurt, joints always seem to seep a little grease though and the
threads tend to stay protected.

BTW socket head 8mm cap screws of the appropriate size should
be able to be found cheap, about $1 each or less to replace
messed up ones if needed.  Might find them at your local hardware store
may have to go to a better fastener store.
