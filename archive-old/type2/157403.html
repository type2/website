Subject: Re: [T2] AC

I guess I need to chime-in, although I dont respond to
hear myself chatter.  I now speak as a Mechanical
Engineer.
   
I side with Karl.  There are a couple of good reasons
why non-trained persons should not work on AC.  At the
top of the list is the fact that R12 is killing the
Ozone layer.  (And converting to R134a involves more
than just draining the R12 and replacing it.  And,
R134a requires addition of a special oil.  Not to
mension the expansion valve and dryer modifications
which should be made when converting from R12 to
R134a.)  
     
I am not a tree hugger.  But releasing R12 into the
atmosphere is both illegal and has an adverse effect
on mother earth.
     
If the issue was both no training and lack of proper
tools, then go ahead- work on your automatic tranny
and screw it up.  Go ahead- work on your CP-091
4-speed 6-rib manual tranny and screw it up.  Only
your T2 dependability and pocketbook will be affected.
 Repairs on both Manual &amp; Automatic Transmissions
require training and specialty tools to do it
properly.  Tinkering with them is unwise without that
training and those specialty tools.  But working on
your own AC has a toxic-waste component which changes
the nature of work performed by backyard mechanics.
     
There is a reason working with R12 requires a license.
    
It is too bad so many 60s to 80s era cars,
refrigerators and freezers were manufactured
world-wide before the adverse effects of R12 became
known.

&gt; Why Not?

&gt; I'll have to say this.
&gt; 
&gt; If a guy is willing to learn, or wants to,what is
&gt; wrong with that?
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing.
