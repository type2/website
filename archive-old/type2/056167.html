&gt; 'm likely to be taking a trip to San Francisco later this summer; and
&gt;  it has occurred to me that I might take advantage of the airline baggage
&gt;  allowance to save some shipping costs on a dual port type 1 engine for
&gt;  my '71 bus.  Several issues arise, however.  Since the weight limit is
&gt;  70 lbs., 


Hey Eric,

I'm not sure on the short block weight but AVP will be able to let ya know.  I
too was gonna fly back an AVP 2.0 LONG block but it's about 20lbs over max
weight with pallet (max weight is 150lbs) for our Cargo service.  The only
problem you may face checking it in lieu of luggage is that since it's not
&quot;luggage&quot; meant for air travel it would be affixed with a &quot;conditional
acceptance tag&quot;  (this basically releases the airline from liability).  That
could be a big bummer if you're on a rough flight were things tend to shift a
lot  : (   Best advice?  &quot;Pack it like it was your first born.&quot; 
You might check with your carriers Cargo department and see what restrictions
they may have and prices so at least you'd have some kinda insurance against
damage.  I'm really only familiar with our rules and restrictions so can't
quote ya on other carriers.

Well, hope this helps.

Later,

Don (SkyCruizer)
