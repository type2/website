hi welcome back

&gt; I have a 1978 Champagne Edition Transporter, which I had repainted and
&gt; reupholstered and customized/modified in 1994-1997, mainly in Tampa,

I remember, nice job

&gt; I bought a Chevy Venture minivan in 1998 and that was the beginning of the

going over to the darkside....

&gt; end.  Now I am married and have a kid, 2 dogs, 3 cats and two home-based
&gt; businesses.  The bus hasn't been started since late summer of 2003.  Oh it
&gt; makes me sad just thinking about it.

Hildegarde, is crying her heart out thinking you have abandoned her.

&gt; I am torn between inspiring myself to
&gt; take better care of it

keep it, you'll be sorry if you don't and your kid will hate you and the
cats will stop using the liter box, all sorts of things will happen if you
sell her

&gt; it deserves to be loved.  One winter I rented a garage for it, but that
&gt; isn't available anymore.  We don't have a garage -- if we did it would be
&gt; pretty easy to park her in there and feel OK. But it's just not right to let
&gt; a Type 2 sit in five feet of snow for five months.

Type 2's love to romp in the snow, I ski and my 78 bus never seems happier
than when it is climbing a snow covered road to a ski slope.  Break down
and get a nice gas heater for her. (check that e-thing or ask around on
the board here, I got mine from a list member)  she'll keep you and your
little one (and even hubby) nice and toasty and she will get thru.

take care

Bob
