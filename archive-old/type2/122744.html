Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the rear axle nut

Hi Scott,

Assuming the arm is 48&quot; long, drill a hole in the end opposite the  
sockets. Hook a &quot;fish scale&quot; onto the hole, and pull on it until the  
scale reads 1/4 of the desired torque.

It's primitive, but it'll get you in the neighbourhood.

Happy trails,

&gt; For re-torqueing it works also, but you don't know
