I can't get the little #_at_*%!!! two inch hose joints reinstalled on the
gas tank vent tubes. (Using new VW fuel hose.)

Is there some kind of authorized lubricant for fuel hoses? Someone
earlier suggested Astroglide for the window seals, but I'm a little
nervous that one of the ingredients (the mint flavoring, perhaps) might
not treat the hoses kindly over time.I suppose the generic equivalent
would be glycerin, tho' this is a bit harder to  um, er, come by.

Other things I've contemplated: lightweight honing oil, moly grease,
cornstarch (might turn the gas to gravy in the tank?).

I really, really would like to know the best way to get those little
hoses on there for the duration.
