Gentlepersons-
                       Sorry about a previous post- the machine was faster 
than I...To begin 
again, anyone on either side of the pond familiar with both SU's and VW's? 
Specifically,
I find myself blessed with a spare set of HS 4's and was toying with the idea 
of affix-
ing them to a 2L VW engine (the laughter will commence here), mostly because 
I have them, and rather like them (familiarity breeds affection). They are 
rather easy to tune
and give a better low end than Webers (WOT...the Weber's got the SU, but this 
is a VW,
not something I'd be looking to flog at high rpm's). Any ideas? Any sources 
for adapters/linkage?
