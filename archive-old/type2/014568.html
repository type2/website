same thing happened with my distributer on this past rebuild.  notch was
at the #2 firing position.  I just timed the same way as though it were
at its regular orientation, keeping the #1 wire at the notch location.
Seems to be fine though it makes me curious if the cam lobes are ramped
specifically for each cylinder.  with the distributor positioned with
the notch at the #2 orientation, the cam would be lifting for # 2 at tdc
though firing for #1.  a humana humana humana....hope you're still with
me.
so my timing is a little peculiar.  won't run well when timed 5 atdc,
with a light of course.  runs great at 5 btdc so maybe I'll check to
make sure the retard really is working.
sorry i didn't attach the original post. webtv won't let you take
snipits from the original.
