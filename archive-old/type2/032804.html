Dave, 

You are very welcome!  Don't thank me, tho... thank Jarrett Kupcinski!
thank Ron Van Ness! thank Ken Hooper!  Information in the raw is not very
valuable. It is the preparer and presenters who deserve credit, and
without them, the pictures would still be disconnected images at my site.

For those in search of sliding door bliss, the page has been added to the
library.  If you go to www.type2_dot_com and click on library then &quot;S&quot; then
sliding door, you will get the article.
