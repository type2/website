Subject: Exhaust question (1982 Vanagon)

Hey all,
    I have a question about the exhaust on my 1982 Vanagon.  Both heater 
boxes are rusted out and need to be replaced.  My research so far 
indicates that this will be an expensive venture.  But a mechanic buddy 
of mine said that since I have a working gas heater I may not need the 
heater boxes, that there may be an adapter kit that costs less.  Of 
course he had only done this to Bugs not Buses, has anyone out there 
heard of this ??  If so where can I get one?

Thanks in advance,

Rodi Thurber

P.S - Sorry if this has been answered, but I did search the archive on 
the website with no luck (damn newbie ;-&gt;  )
