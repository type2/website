Subject: Re: [T2] Pesky heater cables.

SHE SURE DID!!!!      Not to mention that almost all the actors went on to
be major players! Spielberg, Howard, Ford, Lucas, and so on. And there was
the Happy Days spin off, where they had a Volkswagen on screen every now and
then. (VW content)

Have a good one!

Howard

&gt; &gt; I see, so Tony, &quot;Where were you in 62&quot;? ;-) Wonder where that white
T-bird
&gt; &gt; is,..............oh and the blond?

&gt;    The T-Bird went on to become just another bloated Ford...
&gt; The blonde, however, went on to sell &quot;Thigh Masters&quot; on TV... ;-)
