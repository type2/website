Subject: Re: [T2] Help!...need windows parts

[...]



&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I cannot for the life of me find anyone with any replacement parts
&gt; for my sliding windows in my 78 Champagne edition.  The two center windows
&gt; on my non-camper bus.
&gt;
&gt; Rubber guide and the felt strips for starters.
&gt;
&gt; These are the parts internal to the window..I have the outside body to
&gt; window seal.
&gt;
&gt; Are these the same on vanagons?
&gt;
&gt; Please tell me I just missed them on some site!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

As far as I know, no one supplies internal parts for the sliding windows. Not
even VW.

Vanagon windows are about 2&quot; taller than bay windows.

Here is the parts pic of bay windows, but they do not show 78/79 sliders. But
if you look at the vent windows, you will see there is no breakdown of parts
for them.
