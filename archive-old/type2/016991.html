I thought this would also be appropriate to the list:
The passing on October 25, 1998, of Willheim Karmann, the car designer who
created the Karmann-Ghia.

To paraphrase &amp; borrow from the LA Times obit:

He specialized in convertible sports cars, creating the Ghia in 1955, in
cooperation with Volkswagen and Porsche. He went on to design the Scirocco
coup and Golf Cabriolet for Volkswagen. He also created cars for Porsche, BMW,
Opel, Ford and Mercedes-Benz.

I have admired this man for 27 years through his elegant work, the Karmann Ghia.
