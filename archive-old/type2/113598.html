Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Windshield

&gt;BUT... I decided to wash the car and wax it.. and realized that
&gt;water is STILL leaking through the windshield. How can I prevent this? I
&gt;didn't use any window sealer.. was I supposed to? I'm using that window
&gt;gasket from West Coast Metric. It seems like a very good quality gasket..
&gt;the Cal-Style.

NAPA and any glass shop can sell you urethane glass sealant in a caulking 
tube. $15 or so. Do not use silicone.
