&gt; Where did you hear that?  Every manual I've seen states otherwise.  1974
&gt; model year U.S. busses came with 1800 engines from the factory.

also if I am not mistaken the auto tranny bus had fuel injection

ALSO

the 74 auto tranny is a vacuum shift tranny and if you don't have the
correct set up you probably will not get the tranny to work right.

make sure this auto tranny works, it is next to impossible to get parts
for and finding a mechanic is even harder.  however all is not lost, the
later model govenor shift auto tranny's will fit without much hassle and
these are reasonably avaliable and parts can still be found, they also
work much better and are more reliable
