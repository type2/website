Triple A saved my butt more than once.  They are great because any vehicle
you happen to be in can get towed for free as long as you have your card.
This means you can charge your friends twenty bucks and meet them and the
towtruck when they need a tow.  Your friends will happily give you twenty
bucks rather than pay 50+ for towing.  Not to mention, if you ever get
locked out.....
