Subject: Anyone need a clutch?

Hey all:

This is kind of a weird posting, but what the hey, I'll try anyway.

A few months ago I was having major leakage of transmission oil into the 
bellhousing on my '81 Vanagon.  Before dropping the engine to swap out 
the transmission I ordered a complete clutch kit; I was having no 
problem with the clutch but I succumbed to the &quot;as long as your in 
there&quot; school of thinking and replaced parts I could get at with the 
engine out.

Anyway, the old clutch looks fine - no scoring on the pressure plate, no 
significant wear on the fingers, lots of wear left on the driven disk, 
etc.  I was cleaning up the garage today and came across my old clutch.  
Rather than throw it into the trash I thought I'd offer it to anyone who 
needs a clutch and doesn't want to spend a lot of bucks.  I really think 
this clutch will last for many, many more miles, but, naturally, no 
guarantees.

The price is actual shipping cost to your door plus $2 &quot;profit&quot; for me.
