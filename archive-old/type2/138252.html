Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

&gt; Like I said, turn off the the engine and try to stop in a 71-79 bus. It's much harder.

But that does not really answer the question - would it still be
harder if the brake booster was not in the system.  There must be some
data somewhere about how much pressure is required to operate drum vs.
the disk.

&gt; It will be harder. So much so that this will probably be an overall braking downgrade although just slightly above Flintstones.

I have no intention of downgrading my brakes or making my bus unsafe. 
But I also don't care for unnecessary complication.  I did get the
booster/linkages from the donor bus, and I WILL install the booster if
I find the brakes are not up to snuff without it.

Thanks for the info!
