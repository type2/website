Subject: Heat (Electric Fan in Engine Compartment)

I have a 74' Westfalia with the pancake engine (Not a doghouse cooler).  The
small electric fan that hangs from the top of the engine compartment and
blows air through the heater hoses over the heads is not working.   =
I am looking to replace this fan, but I am curious if anyone has used a
larger fan here (in order to assist with heating the Bus interior and
cooling the engine)?  Would a larger fan be too much of a strain on the
electrical
system?  Is this small electrical fan very effective at all?

Thanks for the help,
