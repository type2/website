Wiring short btw battery &amp; fusebox, eh?
 
How the hell can I find out where it is?  I can't
even see the &quot;fusebox&quot; on
the wiring diagram.  On the wiring diagram the 12
fuses are all over the place.

I'm extremely confused and disconsolate.
 
Even Josh is ready to throw in the towel.

OK, try this. The voltmeter is a little deceiving.
Get a lightbulb and put it between the negative post
and the negative battery cable. A fog light bulb works
very well. If the light lights up bright, you have a
short. If it is dim, then replace it with your
voltmeter if it has amps/milleamp capability. See how
many milleamps are being drawn. 1000 ma is 1 amp. 500
ma is 1/2 amp. A 10w interior light bulb will draw
around 350ma.

Amps drain the battery, volts are misleading.

On that wiring diagram, fuses 1 to 12 are S1 to S12.
If you look along the bottom, you will see each part
of the fuse box below where the S? fuse is.
