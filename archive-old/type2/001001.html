Subject: Battery -- May have answered my own question

Hello all,

After I sent my last message I went out and pulled the fuse from the radio
so the memory function wouldn't be drawing any power.  What surprise, still
about 176 mA being drawn!

Well that answered for me how much the stereo is supposed to draw, about
4mA.

So what else is drawing:  I noticed that on the left side of the engine
compartment is a leftover relay from the A/C system which has but one wire
to it:  a wire from the main battery.  I notice that this relay trips each
time I connect or disconnect the battery (audible click).  So I pull the
wire from this relay, and again measure current draw.  Hmm, only 3.5mA (of
course this is still with the fuse for the radio pulled, so something else
is drawing that but I'm not too worried at this point about 3mA).

Removed that wire, plugged the fuse back in for the radio and I'm back up to
7mA.  I can live with that.

So the answer to my question may have been, yes that's too much draw and yes
you need a new battery anyway.  I'll note that this relay has been hooked up
since I've had the van with no problems.  The age of the main battery is
unknown but it looks as if it's been there for a while.  Seems this problem
has cropped up with the onset of cooler weather here, so the battery may be
on its way out anyway.  I'll keep an eye on it, but this should help extend
its life a little, anyway.  I've currently got it on the charger.

Thanks to all!
