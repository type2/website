&gt; Under no circumstances should you purchase a child safety seat used,
from
&gt; anyone, PERIOD!  Even if the seat was involved in one minor wreck
with no
&gt; visible damage, it could still have structurally problems...

I'd respectfully disagree with the above.  There's no reason not to
buy or use a used child seat of modern design as long as you inspect
it for signs of stress or wear.  The materials used in these seats
(mostly molded plastic) are quite durable and should be good for quite
a lot of use.  I've seen car seats in use by day care shuttles (far
heavier use than any private person would inflict) and they last for
two years or more.

If a seat is involved in an accident it will either deform or not.  If
it doesn't deform, then it will be as strong as it was originally.  If
it does deform, the damage should be obvious in the plastic
(discoloration, warpage, etc).  The only safety equipment that really
hides crash damage is helmets and other devices that use crushable
foam that does not rebound.  I've never seen foam of this type used in
child seats.  The webbing used in car seats is overdesigned to spread
the load, and won't break unless it's quite frayed to begin with.

There is a danger in buying an &quot;obsolete&quot; design.  Be sure that the
seat is less than three or so years old (they are date-stamped) and
you'll be fine.

I'm sure that the child seat makers would love it if everyone went out
and bought a new car seat or two for each child.  Unfortunately,
economics often dictates a choice between no car seat or a used car
seat.  The &quot;new seat or nothing&quot; mentality encouraged by the industry
can lead less wealthy parents to make the _really_ wrong choice:
&quot;we'll wait until we can afford a new seat...&quot;

Remember the old VW ads that suggested letting your baby sleep in the
rear seat luggage area of a B**tle?  How times have changed!
