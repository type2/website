Hi Dustin,

Did you grease the old bushing?  If yes, good, leave it.  If no, pull the
starter, use a bottoming tap to remove the old bushing  (as it screws into the
bushing, the end of the tap hits the engine flange, as you continue to turn the
tap, the bushing climbs the tap and voila) Drive in new bushing. An old starter
armature is really, really helphul here.  Bolt starter back in.

Keep smiling,

Mike

Anyway, is this bad?  Do I have to drop the starter again to put the new bushing
