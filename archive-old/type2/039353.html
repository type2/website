&gt;I have noticed a few people on the list use these Deep Cycle Marine

Wal Mart has good prices on them.

&gt;Also..any helpful hints out there for rustproofing the battery tray
&gt;area....mine is completely solid and I want to keep it that way...Thanks for
&gt;the help..Adam

I would go with POR-15.  That's awesome stuff and has been praised on the
