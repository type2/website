Subject: Re:79 Cal bus - EGR filter?

&gt;&gt;I'm sure all models - Federal and California - had EGR filters and
valves.&lt;&lt;

Beg to differ.  Mine doesn't and its a 79 cal bus.  Bentley  makes the
exception  to EGR on '79 and later California models with manual
transmissions.  Check it out.  'Course it might be better to have EGR and
not have the funky xpensive Cal exhaust system.

Not sure, but by deduction, I  think you might be right on the O2 sensor
being a replacement for EGR on these cars.
