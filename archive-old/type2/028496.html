If you have a stock engine here's the short &quot;upright exhaust&quot; guide...please
get a stock exhaust!!! Use copious amounts of penetrant on the head studs
and care in removal.  Likewise use a bunch of anti-seize on every nut and
bolt in reassembly.

The correct parts for a 68-71 are:
211 298 009A muffler kit
211 298 055 damper to tail pipe kit
211 251 301A bracket
211 251 051 E muffler
147 251 157 damper pipe
211 251 237B tail pipe

Although still solid (knock on wood) one of these days my original, 33 year
old muffler is gonna need replacing.  I know that I need to get the proper,
single tail pipe exhaust, but after browsing lots of Vendor's sites there's
terms/nomenclature I don't understand.  The library didn't help since those
articles deal with the TypeIV engine.  Does anyone have an &quot;upright exhaust
for dummies&quot; article?  It would be nice to read about everything including
aftermarket/performance parts and how they differ from stock.
