Subject: Re: [T2] If yuo were going to build a 2.0...

I think torque is a primary issue for me too. Though I plan to put this engine in my Beetle, I prefer to roll up and down the TN hills without the drama of big rpms. I've got a 3.88 gearbox for it too. 

With a stock '69 tranny and the stock 2.0 (911 cooling, dual quiet pack exhaust and Dellorto DRLA 36mm carbs) it pulled the Hyundai okay but was seriously anemic on the hills. 

I NEVER plan to do that again but would like to take the family it in and have long been considering a Westfalia trailer as the #1 accessory for this car and our Cabrio to haul the luggage and toys in. Prob never more than 500-600 lbs of total trailer weight. 

Though I have the Corvair in our bus now, if TN ever goes to smog checks, I might be forced to return to VW power so out would come the sotck engine that i have saved and back into the bus it would go. This formula would be enlightening so I could build a bus engine as well that might be nicer than stock. 

Chris
