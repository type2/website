Subject: Re: [T2] door laminate

&gt;&gt; Better idea: Freud makes a laminate blade especially for this work.
&gt;&gt; Amazon_dot_com's home &amp; garden section should have it.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, and if I'm not mistaken there are some router bits made to trim the
&gt; edges flush.

Yes, there are, and there is also a handy little hand tool for trimming 
flush as well.  Have no idea what it's called but if you explain the 
task I'm sure the hardware store/ home depot type store people will know 
what you're talking about.

In fact, when you first described the project I thought of just putting 
new laminate (melamine?  - also all sorts of colors are available) over 
the old.  I haven't ever tried it, but if you really have no tools, you 
could probably do rough cuts by scoring and snapping the laminate and 
then trimming once it's glued on.
