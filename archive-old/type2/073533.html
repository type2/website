Hello all,

Trying to time my 72 today and was having troubles. I used a strobe timing light
and got the white mark on the fan thingie to line up at 5 degrees (that's what
the Muir book told me to set it to). But somehow, once the timing was &quot;set
properly&quot; at 5 degrees, the bus ran rough and at rpms which seemed to be too
low. Could this white mark be wrong? What is going on? Any help appreciated.

 - Ian, 72 transporter (Vangoh)
