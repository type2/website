What's a PO?

Are you saying the engine is crummy...or just all the extraneous crap 
on it. Steve from Volks Tech said it was a strong engine as long as I 
got the cooling fixed. It was put in in 1999, and didn't see much 
driving...its a GEX engine.

&gt; What the PO didn't know was that he was going to create an overheat 
&gt; problem with all that crummy tin so now he was trying to cool the oil 
&gt; to make up for it. He was throwing money and chasing the glossy 
&gt; catalog ads - not engineering an engine...
