&gt; Heck, for that matter I'm more irritated that 90% of the time the radio
&gt; in the bus is on, there's a freakin' commercial playing.

FWIW, there was a show on local radio in the NYC area about the
&quot;golden age&quot; of top 40 radio, when the WABC (DING!) All-Americans
competed for listeners with WMCA and WINS...The funny thing was
that 19 to 21 minutes of each half hour was devoted to commercials
and promos...Good thing the songs were shorter then... ;-)
