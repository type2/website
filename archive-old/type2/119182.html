Subject: Timing with 005 dizzy

I am running a Bosch 005 Dizzy on a Weber carbed 2 L engine.  And have a big
deadspot (more than usual with the old Weber)  I have it timed at 7.5.  If
anyone else is running this dizzy could you please let me know what you have
it timed at if you are having good luck with it.
Thanks in advacne,
Snoopy
