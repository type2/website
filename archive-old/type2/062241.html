Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

&gt;From: Scott Catlin, Scott.Catlin_at_sierra_dot_com
&gt;The heads must be taken off in order to get the old tubes out and put the new
&gt;ones in. As far as sealant, all I used and was recommended to use, was the new
&gt;gaskets that come in your basic engine gasket kit. Of course I'm working on a
&gt;'65 not a '80 but the heads should still need to come off. Otherwise how are you
&gt;going to get the push rod tubes out from around the push rods? Happy wrenching!

&gt;From Randy:
On my '75 bus, the tubes (non-bellowed, of course), sit in bores in the head and in 
the block.  The bores are through the head, and the tubes can be pushed through the 
bore.  They get a little stuck.  What I did (last Thursday, in fact), was to put a 
crescent wrench on the tube at the neck, and to use it to push the tube out of its 
seat, and on out through the head.  My engine was out at the time (still is, in 
fact).  The rockers are off, the pushrods are out, and then the tubes come off.  
This makes it easier to get the cylinders off, since the deflector plate can then 
be removed.

Does anyone know whether it is advisable to do this with the engine installed?  How  
would you make sure, for instance, that the tappets don't fall out on the ground?  
Mine tended to slide out a bit on their own, though I had to pull them most of the 
way out with my fingers.  Smooth fit.
