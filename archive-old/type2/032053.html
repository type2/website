Subject: Re: '79 Cal bus - EGR filter?
In-Reply-To: &lt;199810131406.HAA26900_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.96L.981013131657.1596C-100000_at_alberti.unh_dot_edu&gt;

I read somewhere that The 1979 cal. models had oxygen sensors but not egr
filters and that the Federal models had egr setups but not oxygen sensors.
I have a 79' federal model and I know that I had an egr setup and no o2
sensor.  However I recently had the egr pipe sealed because of the cost of
a replacement filter(over $200).  I am not sure but I think I read this in
the Bently manual.  Possibly under the Fuel injection system section.
