&gt; 
&gt; Hello All,
&gt;     I did a search in the archives for &quot;adventure wagon conversion&quot; and =
&gt; turned up little of nothing.  That being the case, what kind of info can =
&gt; anyone give me on the adventure wagon conversion?  Is it a decent camper =
&gt; set-up?  What about that huge top stuck up there all the time? How is =
&gt; the handling?  Are these conversions less inexpensive to buy than a =
&gt; Westafalia conversion?  I have searched the web and come up empty.  Any =
&gt; info would be appreciated!  Thanks!

Brian,

First of all, are you talking about a &quot;Adventure Camper&quot; conversion or a
&quot;Adventurewagon&quot; conversion.  I am not sure, but I think they are 2
different beasts.  That aside, I have a 1972 Adventure Camper
conversion.  It has a metal tag on the side, near the propane tank, that
identifies it as a Adventure Camper, manufactured in Sylmar, CA or
Burlingame, CA.  I found somewhere on the web that the company still
exists in Fort Bragg, CA, though they don't do VW conversions anymore,
they sometimes have an old VW conversion for sale on their lot.  I have
the address if you are interested.  You might have seen my postings
concerning my vehicle, I have posted several times about it since I have
purchased it.  

As far as handling is concerned, I can't say, because I have only driven
mine a couple of miles, from the PO's house to mine.  Couldn't get the
thing above 35 mph because of splices in the accelerator cable.  Tore
the engine out as soon as I got it home, and haven't had it running
since.  Replacing alot of stuff, the PO and PPO were idiots.

Are they less expensive than Westies?  I can't say, mine certainly was! 
I really like the camper layout, that is why I bought it.  I am 6' 2&quot;
and I can stand up inside.  From what I can tell, the camper in mine is
complete.  Sink with 12 gallon storage tank and Everpure water filter
(don't know if this was standard, installation looks like it was) behind
drivers seat, 2 burner stove and icebox behind passenger seat, 4 tables
(large one in front of back seat w/leaf, one between cabinets at
walkthru, one that sticks out the slider, and one in front of passenger
seat (we call this the rolling table)), childs cot, Back seat folds down
into a twin bed, LOTS of storage in top, cool luggage rack incorporated
into top, etc.  Everything worked when I got it except the faucet, found
a replacement at the local camper supply store for $20.

One thing I should mention.  Based on the Westies I have seen, the
quality of construction of the cabinets in the Adventure camper is not
as good as the Westies.  I plan on rebuilding my cabinets one at a time
in the future.

Well, I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions.  I
have a couple of pictures up at www.homestead_dot_com/mvandam if you are
interested.  Hope to get some more pictures up in the near future.
