Subject: WHAT HAVE I DONE?

Hello, I have a 72 van and last night i changed the oil.
I thought i put enough oil in.i drove about 5 blocks to the gas station and it
wasn't running very good.
very low power.at the gas station i looked at the engine and i went to check
the oil.it was nearly empty.oh no.
so i filled the engine with oil and it barely started.it seemed to run okay
after it started so i went on my way.
i was heading down the freeway and i could hear a chattering noise like the
valves were loose.and then i heard
what sounded like a metal can bouncing around in the engine.sound seemed to
come from right side.
the engine died and then it wouldn't even turn over_dot_can anyone help me
determine what i have done?

Thanks everyone,
Darren
