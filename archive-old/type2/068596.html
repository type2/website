Subject: '79 2.0 heat

I am hunting for a catalog or information on Southwind type heaters for 
my bus. I've read several references to these units but no addresses or 
prices. Are they expensive? I am starting to plan a restoration project 
and would like to include one of these heaters so I can visit my sister 
in Wisconsin this winter with out frost bite. I would also like to go 
camping with my bus and thought buying one of these heaters would be a 
smart move.
