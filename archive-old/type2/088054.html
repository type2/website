Subject: interior paint

Hi Everybody,
    We have a '71 westy and I'm wondering how to find the right paint for
the interior.  I know about the m-code plate but that only seems to have the
paint code for the exterior paint.  Is there a way to find the color of the
interior paint?
It's white, but white is just like every other color and can be had in very
many variations.
    Thanks in advance for the help.
