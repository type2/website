Subject: removing seat to remove fridge

Hi everyone,
A while back I asked how to remove the fridge and got some pretty good 
replies.
I never got around to doing it, but saved the replies on my computer. Any 
way, I can't find them now. So today I decided to wing it. (Sorry if this 
question was already answered, I tried to search the archives, but had no 
luck) I have the linen closet and the side closet out. I have the bolt from 
under the sink out. Do I need to worry about any of the wiring? Also, I 
remember I have to remove the seat. Do I have to remove the wood piece with 
the door on it below the seat also? Am I missing anything else?
Thanks so much,
Peace,
Kyle
