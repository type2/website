Subject: Fuel Filter Saga: Well, That Didn't Help...

Hi Again All --
After experiencing some serious hesitation/bucking problems upon
acceleration (usually after shifting into 2nd and 3rd gears) that felt like
my bus was starving for fuel, I reluctantly replaced the fuel filter --
reluctantly since it had only been 6 months since my last filter change. 
(I thought it was the obvious fix, but the interval seemed short.)  Well,
after taking a pleasurable bath in gas under the bus while swapping the
damn thing out, it made no difference whatsoever.  I also then tried a
brand-new rotor (no effect) and tested the coil (looks great).  I can find
no obvious disconnections in the engine compartment, and it starts fine
with no laboring.  I'm stumped.  To recap:  the bus, after I shift it into
say 2nd or 3rd gear, will begin to accelerate and then quickly just lose it
-- as if fuel or air or something has been abruptly cut off; it doesn't die
or anything (it still idles nicely), but after a moment it will regain
power and shoot off as if normal.  Next time (or time after that) that I
come to a stop and start the shift sequence all over again, the same thing
will happen: alternating between stepping on the gas to hesitiation and/or
no effect and then regaining power again.  This has been getting
progressively worse throughout the day.

Can anyone suggest any further culprits or avenues to investigate as I
troubleshoot this thing?  I thought this was a fuel-related problem all the
way, but now I'm clueless (i.e. could it be electrical?).  Thanks for your
help!
