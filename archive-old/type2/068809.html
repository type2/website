Subject: FS:  Rust-Free '78 PopTop Camper in Pa.

1978 WESTFALIA POPTOP CAMPER, Exc. cond., for sale in Pennsylvania.
*This is a really, really nice bus.*

Body is BEAUTIFUL. California bus, never saw snow.  NO RUST AT ALL, period. 
No dents at all.  Other than one scrape, paint is nice.  

Interior is nice.  Deluxe camper package (stove, sink, fridge, etc.). 
Sleeps 4. Includes all options (2 tables, storage box, childs cot, etc.) 
Poptop canvas has a couple of rips, could be patched, but probably should 
be replaced. 4 speed trans, factory air (needs freon??).

I bought this bus with a bad motor, in order to put in my good motor and 
sell it. Since I haven't yet replaced the engine, I can offer the buyer a 
few options:  $3850 with the good motor installed (2 liter, hydraulic 
lifters); or $3200 with no motor.  Other options:  I have a high 
performance Porsche 914 motor that could go in it (this bus would really 
fly!!), or a rebuilt motor of the buyer's choice.

E-mail or (610) 754-8989 for more info.
