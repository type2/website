&gt;
&gt;  &quot;   I just put on some new heater boxes  and
&gt; they aren't sitting right against the engine.  I think my old studs that
&gt; come out of the engine may have been bent and are holding the heater box
&gt; from fitting exactly up against the engine.  I can feel air shooting out
&gt; from around the exausht manifold.  I think i am going to replace the old
&gt; studs and get new gaskets.  Does anyone have any tips for me or help.&quot;

you MUST use new gaskets. if you need new studs they are a pain to find even vw
can't get the proper ones (refer to my last posting) i am awaiting confirmation
that rmmw has the proper sized studs.  also the gaskets are a pita to get on
right. i had to resort to using assembly fluid every time i've put on exchangers
or jtubes on a bus (5 times) i know it may result in a poor seal but I have
never been able to get the copper gaskets to sit properly without it and i don't
think it is worth removing the engine to put the boxes on , although this is the
vw recommended procedure. also be certain that you are not feeling cooling air
from the fan. exhaust gases will be very hot when they have just left the head.
good luck

ps i will post the address of my page describing exchanger replacement later
this evening
