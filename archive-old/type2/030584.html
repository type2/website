Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance on fire - 80 Westy

Thanks for the messages - I think it was magnesium - it ran hot, the
fire deptartment's water spray pushed a fourth-of-july quality spark
show across the street. Evidently water only makes it worse.....maybe
the rebuilt engine installed had magnesium?

&gt; Back to my van...what can people surmise might have started the fire? It
&gt; seemed to be to the left as you look at the engine, and in the middle.
&gt; Maybe in front of the distributor? Or around there? There are char marks
&gt; on the seat cushion I pulled out as well (which is in excellent shape
&gt; otherwise :( ).
&gt;
&gt; Also, maybe I should stay away from the magnesium block next time?
&gt;

&gt; Thanks,
