&gt;The directions are kinda sketchy. I'm assuming, since David Schwarze was
&gt;the last person to adjust my carbs, that step 4, &quot;Adjust idle mixture
&gt;screws to factory specifications,&quot; is taken care of. The rest of it just
&gt;makes my brain glaze over. Can anyone out there demystify this process
&gt;so I don't feel like I'm going to waste an afternoon totally screwing up
&gt;my bus?

I know I found and saved a great presentation on this from one of the list
regulars, perhaps even Schwarze. He puts out some jewels. However, the
archive being down and no throughough procedure having been reposted today,
I will relate the procedure off the top of my head, above the brow ridge.
Compare to Bentley and ignore any errors identified thereby in my submittal.

The mixture screws at the base of the carbs should be turned out exactly
the same, see Bentley.
On the left carb, set the air bypass big screw on top all the way in then
out a 'couple turns. Turn the throttle screws in just enough to keep the
throttle plate from touching the bores. Set the mixture screws in the base
of the carbs exactly the same no. of Bentley turns out. Ohh, did you verify
the float weights and levels??? Then back up and do it and while your at it
check the idle solinoids and chokes for function and adjstment.

Motor at operation temp. Remove air inlet ducts/filter as the case may be.
With engine idling, measure air flow through both carbs. Pop the linkage
off the right carb. Check and compare air flow. 

Adjust the throttle plates to balance air flow at proper idle rpm. If the
shafts are tight they will be very close and only one will need a very
small adjustment. Once those are balanced, all further idle adjustment is
with the upper big adjustment screw.

Loosen the lock nuts on the right link and adjust so it lines up with the
ball and pop it back on. Now you need three hands or good dexterity. Using
the accelerator cable mount, hold the throttle open and dead steady at 2000
rpm or so. You want a steady rpm off idle. Measure air flow of each carb at
the same rpm, adjust link and repeat as required till you have balanced air
flow off idle/on linkage. Retighten the link lock nuts.

Make your final mixture and idle adjustments with the upper left carb screws.

Can you say, Smoooooooth? If your linkage and throttle shafts aren't worn,
yes indeed.

This all assumes factory carbs on 72 to 74 T-II with the OEM air filter and
all hoses properly connected.  Monitor your spark plugs to verify balanced
combustion.
 
Beware, if you have false air leaking through worn shafts, hoses unhooked
or hooked up wrong, or something not spec as to compression or ignition,
you can play with them all afternoon and get nowhere and worse. Always
confirm specs in the following order, mechanical, then ignition, then fuel
delivery. Otherwise, your just pokin' screwdrivers to no avail.
