Subject: Charcoal Filter - Thanks!

Hi Folks,

Thanks for the info on the charcoal filter.  I had no idea it was for 
passenger safety as well as for emissions - maybe that's why my '72 Beetle 
convertible always smelled like gas!  I'll find a new filter and hook it up 
like it's supposed to.

Thanks again!
