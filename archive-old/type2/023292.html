Subject: Why VW's leak

It's Friday so I thought I would share some insight to why VW's leak. This 
concept was originated by Jim Isbell on the Corvair list and he originally 
applied it to a Jaguar...

I think it applies to VW's too.

Another fellow suggested that the Brits drink warm beer because they have 
Lucas refrigerators...

I think I see a trend.. &lt;grin&gt;

Ciao!
