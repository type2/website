Subject: Re: [T2] Why can't people fix things right?

Hello,
My latest purchase (74 Westy)has more rigging than any
car I have ever seen. There are four or five extra
nobs in the dash that I don't even know what do. They
rigged in some little lights on the iside of the bus
kinda like the ones they use in limos, They rigged one
of those vangon heaters under the rear seat but didn'y
run any water to it so it melted and they left it in
there. There are extra gauges that don't work, Extra
sockets rigged into the 110 westy wiring(actually work
and are super convienient), 1600 beetle engine rigged
in with no tin to fill gaps usually taken up by T4
motor, Universal side marker lenses, rigged
taillights( only one taillight and both turn signals
work, no reverse or passenger tail light, all heater
ducting removed, home duct pipes(like the kind used
for the fans above your stove in your house) welded to
heater boxes and go through holes under the back seats
in the interior( through the metal and theough the
wood on the bench seat). Wires hacked up left and
right in the engine bay, front spare tire carrier
holding the tire by two 8mm nuts and bolts, and
finding more every day. The only reason I bought this
bus because there is only about a nickels worth of
rust on the whole thing, and I found the original
plaid in perfect shap under all of there home made
seat cover's, Table and sink cabinet are pristine, as
is the icebox cabinet. And I got it pretty cheap.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; Ever notice just how many VWs out there have some
&gt; sort of rigging on them? ON 
&gt; my recent purchase (86 Vanagon) the $8 plastic
&gt; ignition switch broke but 
&gt; rather than replace it the previous owner went to a
&gt; discount store, purchased 
&gt; a universal ignition, cut the factory wires,
&gt; butchered the plastic housing 
&gt; and now the bus has to use two keys!  SOme people...
&gt;  Can you guess how long 
&gt; I waited before putting it back the RIGHT way? I
&gt; fixed it on my first day 
&gt; off! Same situation on my 63 Beetle! They ruined a
&gt; never touched car to drill 
&gt; a hole in the dash to mount a horn button and to run
&gt; a new wire to the horn. 
&gt; WHY? Because the horn ring broke!!!  Without it the
&gt; horn won't make the 
&gt; needed contact!!! People can be so stupid! Also,
&gt; this car had a European 
&gt; steering lock ignition. When the electrical part
&gt; burned out the morons 
&gt; drilled a hole in the dash to place a regular USA
&gt; switch in it. All that 
&gt; extra work when all they needed to do was to order
&gt; the switch (like I did!). 
&gt; Now my extra dash hole is a cigarette lighter
&gt; accessory socket.
&gt; Just don't get me started on my crew cab's
&gt; nightmares....
&gt; I'm interested in any one elses &quot;horror&quot; stories.

&gt; crew cab in need of 
&gt; resto), and Mystery (86 Vanagon).
