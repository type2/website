Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

&gt; I have seen this before.  It is caused by that thin, bent-up piece of

&gt; pushrod as it moves in and out (and rotates), causing the groove.

David's exactly right.  A few of my buses have had this.  It's strange 
because the damned thing looks like it was machined that way.  If you 
put that spring clip in the wrong way, it'll do it every time.
