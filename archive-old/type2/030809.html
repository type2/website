	Hey, gang. I'm in the throes of my first rebuild (2.0 L) and the
pistons (not to mention a lot of other stuff) came from two parts motors.
My original pistons are 1800, and I felt like bumping everything up, hence
the new ones. Much to my chagrin, I weighed them and got the following
results, in grams:

458
462
481
485

	Hoping to scarf some weight from the wrist pins, I found them all
to be within a gram of one another. I don't relish the prospect of shaving
25 grams of aluminum from a piston; I especially don't relish having to
trust it after doing so. Does anybody out there have a similar mismatched
set they'd be willing to swap or sell me? Additional misfortunes include
me ending my lease on the 31st, so I'm in a bit of a hurry. TIA,

Ian
