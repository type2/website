Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vacuum gauge

From your experience, does altitude affect your vacuum readings? I Live at 7000
ft and was just wondering if you ever noticed if vacuum decreased with
altitude.
Thanks

&gt; An in-dash vacuum gauge is very nice to have IMO, and amusing on long

&gt; engine.  I've been running one for several years - here is my installation
&gt; for anyone that's interested.  There is also a picture of the Vanagon
&gt; speedo (6-digit odometer plus resettable trip meter) installed in my
&gt; baywindow dashboard.
