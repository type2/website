Subject: peter aschwanden artwork

Hello,

peter aschwanden is the guy that did all of the artwork for the idiots guide 
- anyone know where you can buy large prints of some of his work?

there used to be a website I thought, that sold bus/bug stuff, that had the 
exploded beetle and a few others, but I cannot remember (or locate) which it 
was..

tips, hints, thoughts, and tomfoolery welcome.
