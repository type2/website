Subject: Re: [T2] engine case crack?

[...]
check for leaks at the oil drain plug and at the oil screen plate.  
then after that it is possible that it is just taking oil from further 
up a while to finish dripping down.  I dont think i have ever seen a 
cracked t4 case that didnt have a rod sticking through it.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; quick Q. is it possible that I have a case crack if
&gt; oil is leaking withouth the engine running for an
&gt; extended period of time? Ie, I leave the bus sitting
&gt; for a week and there is a puddle underneath. From what
&gt; I understand the pushrods are above the oil line and
&gt; so is the oil cooler. right? so unless its coming out
&gt; of a split in the case or a crack what other options
&gt; are there? Thanks for the help and sorry for my
&gt; ignorance.
