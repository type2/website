&gt; &gt;One wonder I do have in rebuilding is that the inner and outer surfaces on
&gt; &gt;the hub and the castle nut are badly deformed.  I am thinking of taking
&gt; &gt;them to a machinist and seeing if they can be ground flat.  Any reason not
&gt; &gt;to?  I don't see the dimension as being critical element.
&gt; 
&gt; I think all those cursed rear hub parts on that van should be thrown
&gt; away.  Steve didn't exactly mention in his need to replace bearings
&gt; that I think I've seen him retighten the 46mm on that '80 at least 3
&gt; times.  Which is 3 times more than I've ever touched that nut on any
&gt; van in my live except to pull a rear drum I can't get off a Vanagon.


If the inner thrust surface of the drum is deformed much it has to go.
My feeling /preach mode/ is that the splines in the hub are worn which
supplies engough wiggle to get the inner hub thrust area to wear in turn
lossening the axle nut. rinse and repete. The hub is the softest metal in
the lot and essentially becomes sacraficial. I chased this again recently
and it was only solved by drum replacement (replaced bearings but they
were good upon inspection) /preach mode disabled/
