&gt; Finally jumped in and bought a new ICOM IC-706 to install in Casper,

Hoo boy!  DC-to-light in a bus!

&gt; What really looks like it might work out well is the many options I 
&gt; have for installing the remote faceplate of the radio. It would fit 
&gt; just perfect in the VW bus dashboard  where a normal radio installs, 
&gt; but, of course, then I lose the depth of my righteous tunes from my 
&gt; boom box sound; so necessary for us old hippy bus drivers.

This is the route that I am going to use.  I don't use the stereo all that
much anyway, so the control head will replace it.  I'll put a quality
speaker in the stock location and have the &quot;world's most expensive FM mono
radio!&quot;  The 706 has excellent reception on the FM and AM broadcast bands,
BTW.  It just needs a decent speaker.

&gt; For one thing, I discovered that the faceplate for my ashtray is bolted 
&gt; to the ash tray assembly on nut, affixed to a bolt coming out of the 
&gt; back of the ash tray faceplate.
&gt; The faceplate of the ash tray is affixed to the ash tray slide assembly 
&gt; by one small nut.
&gt; Removing that small nut allows me to remove the ash tray faceplate, 
&gt; bolt the radio faceplate mount in it's place, and then have the radio 
&gt; faceplate available right at my finger tips, looking as though it was 
&gt; designed to be there all along.

Two things you want to think about:

The control wires from the control head exit to the left, so you need to
accommodate them in your design

If you intend to connect the mic to the control head, your mount will have
to be strong enough to take the pulls on the coil cord. (you can plug the
mic into the radio itself, though)

&gt; This will place the radio faceplate almost as perfectly as possible, 
&gt; and even will allow me to bend necessary hardware so as to tilt the 
&gt; view of the faceplate right towards me as I drive down the road.

IN practice, it might be a little low, and it's nice to have something to
rest the heel of your hand against while tuning.  Another plus for the
stock radio position.

&gt; The main radio box is small enough that it can be installed in so many 
&gt; places such that my making the optimal choice almost becomes an n 
&gt; factorial selection process.

Mine is going behind the passenger seat, on the bulkhead.  This is out of
the way and relatively clean.  keep in mind that you will have to run some
_big_ power wires to the radio.  I'm using 8-ga and that's barely enough.
For CW or RTTY (in a bus??!) you need more current-carrying capability.

I'm currently using a Hustler short mast and Hustler Super resonators on
75m and 40m.  These work OK and are short enough to stay under the 13.5 ft
limit on the luggage rack.  BTW, if you use a luggage rack for the mount,
it has to be _well_ grounded to work correctly.  I use 8-guage wire and
copper strip on opposite corners of my full-length rack to get the SWR
down to 1.2.

I think that I will give the AH4 tuner and a straight whip a try shortly,
as I would like more frequency agility on the road.  The Hustlers are
_really_ narrow, like 50Khz on 75m!
