Subject: engine replacement

I had to leave my bus behind in Detroit, MI, when I
moved to the lovely metropolis of NYC.  Well now I am
going back to retrieve it - the only problem - it is
running on 3 cylinders.  My plan is to just replace
the engine - I can get a used 2000cc for 895 with 300
core deposit.  The 2nd part of the problem - I don't
have any idea what I am doing when it comes to
dropping and replacing the engine.  Is there anyone
out there who might be in the Detroit area July 28-31
or August 4-7 - who would be so kind as to give a girl
a hand.  I will compensate - meal - beer.  I just need
some assistance - you know telling me if I am doing
things right.
