Welcome Meredith!

List,

Could the alternator be the problem? My fan shroud
routes a channel of air to
cool the internals of the alternator. My guess is
that if this gets hot... then you might
not be providing the bus with the necessary
&quot;running&quot; voltage.


I had similar problems:
Although the ground wire from the Ignition Module
was the problem.

I would check to see where yours is grounded.
Its a larger brown wire that should be grounded to
the metal frame.
Not the gas tank cover.

I'd get a new stock Coil, Distributor Cap and
Rotor from a VW dealer.
It's a fairly inexpensive repair. [See type2_dot_com
for the part numbers.]

If that's not it. I'd question the internals of
the distributor itself.
There are specially lubricated contacts that we're
required rebuild on my car.

Tools.. yea. get as many as you can afford.

Hi Volks,

My name is Meredith and I have a '79 2000 FI Kombi
and her name is Isobel.
I have been searching through the library and the
archives for about a week
as I didn't want to pose my question without
checking for an answer myself
first.  I am not a premiere mechanic as many of
you listers seem to be but I
fairly competent and I plan on learning my girls
engine inside and out over
time.

My problem is this.  Took the bus to the San
Raphael Swell in Central Utah
and she ran great the whole time.  No weird noises
and the gauges were all
straight up where they ought to be.  Coming down
out of a canyon late Sunday
night, the RPMs dropped to 0 in a split second
with no other indications of
power loss.  I still had power and ignition.  She
would turn over but not
catch.   I managed to get my little boys home with
the help of a nice
missionary couple and I went back to her in the
morning and she started
right up, first time, no problem.  So, I decided
to drive her home with my
back up vehicle following.  She ran fine all day
and then in the middle of
the blasted I15 Freeway, she died in the same
manner as the night before.  I
waited for a couple of hours and she would not
start so I had to call
Allstate and have them come and get me because the
seven highway patrolmen
that I spoke to didn't want me to stay and I
didn't want to stay where I was
either.  Very scary spot!

So, I am assuming, I have spark, I have fuel, I
have a new ignition module,
and I am guessing that it might be the coil as I
know that if the coil gets
hot it might not run and when it is completely
cooled it will.  My bus did
start the next day and thankfully she is sitting
in my driveway now.  I hope
it is the coil because that would be a good
project for me to tackle.

Anyone have any suggestions for me.  I guess I
need to go buy a voltmeter
and a torque wrench to add to my tool collection.
Any advice would be much
appreciated.  I really miss her and it has only
been a day or two since I
haven't been able to climb up in her and take off.

Pieces,

Meredith &amp; Isobel '79 Kombi
