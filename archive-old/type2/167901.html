Subject: update on the mice

Hi, thanks for all your suggestions and stories about the potential mice 
problems. They had already started to plug up the the cooling fan with 
bits of, who knows what. Also found a huge nest in one of the cupboards. 
I had used poison before I got the suggestions not too. But I don't 
smell any dead ones yet, so maybe I got lucky. I haven't seen any sign 
of them for a few days, maybe they're gone.
Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.
