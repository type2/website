Subject: Oil Filter/Mexican Longblock

Okay Volks:

Being shipped to me tomorrow is a brand new 0-mile
longblock, coming from Nogales AZ. via Beetlemex (who
comes highly recommended).  The engine costs $980. and
has hydraulic lifters. There's the rub...hydraulic
lifters require extra clean oil, and to that end, the
Beetles have an oil filter which comes off the oil
pump.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really work on a bus
(type 1, at least) because the carrier bolts for the
moustache bar occupy the same space.  Miguel's solution
is to just attach the engine to the moustache bar,
which although he claims works fine for some guy in his
shop isn't something I'm willing to try with a brand
new engine and tranny.  Here are the alternatives, as I
see them: 1.Find some way of working around the bolt(s)
...doubtful. 2. Run high quality oil and dump it every
3k miles (which I should do anyway, and which Miguel
says would solve all my problems of keeping the oil
clean since I don't run on dirt roads anyway). 3. Find
an alternate way of mounting an oil filter suggested by
my brilliant, helpful type 2 friends (an excellent possibility).

Help!
TIA, 
Dan
