&gt;     Why not take the time to get a Ham license?  Rather than 4 or 5 mile
&gt; range you will have from 10 to 5000 miles, a wide choice of frequencies
&gt; best suited to the particular communication task, telephone access over
&gt; much of the country via phone patch, and lots of new communication modes
&gt; from TV to satellite to Digital?

PS:
Seriously, while ham radio is the most fun that you can have with your
clothes on, it isn't really worth the study, testing, and expense just to
talk from bus to bus.  A $49 CB will work OK, and a $39 FRS handheld will
work even better (no installation required!)
