Subject: EEC Control Valve question

    Hi everyone,

    I just figured out my EEC Control Valve is gone. I have been trying to
get the fuel venting system working on my '79 westy. Does anyone have any
experience replacing the EEC Control Valve (the one in the air filter
housing)? Or should I just leave it by-passed and not bother?

    Many thanks again!

    :) sheldon '79 Westy &quot;deluxe&quot;
