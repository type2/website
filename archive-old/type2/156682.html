You bring up an important point.  None of our engines is completely
stock.  Every rebuild introduces new cylinders and pistons and therefore
has the chance of changing the compression ratio.

The engine that came
with my bus pinged on hot uphills on 87 so I learned to fill it with 89
(or 92 if it was only half-empty) before climbing Sierra passes in summer.
My new Mexican engine doesn't ping on 87, but then again it doesn't climb
the hills quite as fast either.
