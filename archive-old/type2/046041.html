&gt;Smog requirements, not necessarilly good running.  I'd really try the

OK, well here is what I am getting to:

I have two 1970 1600 SP Westy busses.
Good engines in both.

AA)
NewBus is all California stock from the get go, and gets 25 mpg.
He has the EGR cannister still hooked up.
He is mainly my city driver.

BB)
Casper is also of California origins and his engine was rebuilt by 
myself to really fine detail, and staying to all stock components.
Before .. and after the rebuild, he stays at 19mpg consumption.
Bummer, since he is my long trip driver.

Casper has a .009 dizzy.
Casper has Mahle heads w/ about 15,000 miles on them.
Casper does not have the EGR cannister.
Casper has a new carb, w/ about 15,000 miles on it, and I am unsure as 
to how it might be jetted.

Casper's dizzy was just changed out yesterday to a vac advance; 
identically same as on the other bus.

I am going to log Casper's fuel consumption on an upcoming trip to see 
what I am getting with the vac advance dizzy.

Now then, Casper, to my nose and senses, seems to be running a bit rich.
I also think he runs just a bit cooler than NewBus, so those two 
entities go hand and hand.

If the new dizzy shows mpg improvement, great !
If not, then I guess I start to look at the jets in NewBus and Casper 
to see what the diff might be there.

What do you think ?
Sometimes I think it might be better to just stay at 19 mpg, thinking 
that Casper runs all the cooler because of it !?
Again, what do you think ?

I know......... Tweek, tighten, check, re-check,,,,, break and strip 
........ Damn !!
