Bill and the List,

There was an article a few years ago in &quot;Hot VWs&quot; about a Splitty that was
restored/customized and was being towed behind a big motor home.  The motor
home was one of those that look like a big Trailways or Greyhound bus.  The
Splitty was painted to match.  Made a really neat looking setup.  I will dig
around and see if I can come up with the article.  Maybe they covered the
necessary mods for towing (yeah, right!).
