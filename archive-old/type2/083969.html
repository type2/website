Subject: Re: [T2] Disk Brakes and type 1 engine

Watch those nylocks in that area.  I ran mine for 6 months and didn't
notice that they were loose until I pulled the engine again for other
things.  When I looked the nuts over I found that the nylon had heated
enough to go brittle.  I thought I was doing good putting in Stainless
and Nylocks!

I replaced them all with standard stainless split lock washers and nuts.

I have made it a habit to replace any hardware I encounter with
stainless unless it's clear that it needs harder bolts.  I really
dislike dealing with rusty bolts.

I had the standard Bug engine in my 71 for years but got into the habit
of checking the oil pump cover adaptor regularly for looseness, even
with nylocks.
