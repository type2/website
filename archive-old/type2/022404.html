Subject: BN2 regulator question
X-WSS-ID: 16602030163138-01-01
 charset=us-ascii

Now that I have a working glow plug for my BN2 again, I found something else that is keeping it from running properly.  I believe the problem is with a small silver assembly mounted next to the relay which I believe to be a regulator of some sort.  The schematics I have for this heater do not show this silver gizmo - I think it is not needed if you have a metering fuel pump.  My fuel pump is the older style which must be regulated as it spews out a ton of gas otherwise.

The heater does run, but usually in only one of two modes.  First mode:  It will light off and run for a minute or two and gradually die out, apparently from fuel starvation as the fuel pump rarely clicks.  Second mode:  Runs extremely rich, drinks gas and puts out choking black smoke.  In this mode, the fuel pump &quot;clicks&quot; once about every two seconds and it will go through a glassful of gasoline in ten minutes.  I don't know why it goes between these modes.

In addition, there is a weep hole in the side of the regulator and gas bleeds out of it when the fuel pump clicks.  I disassembled the regulator and couldn't find any problems.  The diaphrams look okay.  I guess I will pull it apart again and have another look.

Once when it was running in mode two I let it run for almost an hour.  Eventually it settled into what looked like normal operation - no black smoke, tons of nice hot air coming out, and the fuel pump was clicking about once every 7 or 8 seconds.  I shut it off and the next time I turned it on, I couldn't get it to work correctly again.  Not sure what changed.  The regulator also has an adjustment screw which affects the position of one of the diaphrams, but moving it doesn't seem to have any effect.

Any ideas?  I don't know where to go from here as I don't know who made this regulator and I doubt I will be able to find another one, or replacement diaphrams (if in fact it does have a hole that I missed).

Thanks in advance,

-David
