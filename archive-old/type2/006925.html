Hi all,
     My Dad came out to visit from Texas, and as he was here for about a 
week, showing the wonders of California to his fiancee SueEllen, we 
decided it was high time to revisit Kings Canyon. While it's a gorgeous 
locale, it seems that even many Californians have never visited it-I 
first learned of it from the Music Librarian at El Camino College, Don 
Brown (Thanks Don!), who waxed enthusiastic about the glories of the 
canyon. Sam and I visited in '96 on the way to Inuvik, and it immediately 
became our favorite camping site. So, this time around I got Friday and 
Monday off work, and off we went. I hope to post this to my website in 
the next few days with some accompanying pictures...

     Left work a wee bit early on 3 August, did an oil change, and gave 
the '78 VW Westfalia a once over, then proceeded to load 'er up. 
Departure was from Antioch, CA, on 4 August, at around 9am. We wanted to 
get an earlier start, since the major portion of the drive is through the 
San Joaquin valley, but 9 was as early as we could swing. We intended to 
stop in Fresno to get groceries, but by the time we got there we were to 
dang hot and just kept on rolling. Never did get groceries, so we made do 
with the high prices and poor selection of the Cedar Grove lodge in Kings 
Canyon proper. 

     The drive in was, as always, spectacular. After climbing to 
something like 8000 feet, route 180 drops clear down to the canyon floor, 
at about 2000 feet, conveniently providing countless spectacular vistas 
along the way. At the bottom of the canyon, the road intersects with the 
King River, and meanders up the canyon with the river to about 4800 feet. 
Kings Canyon is a glacially carved valley, like Yosemite, and it shares 
much of it's style of scenery with Yosemite, in an admittedly more modest 
way. One thing it doesn't share is Yosemite's stifling popularity and 
year round waiting list. It never ceases to amaze me that in the height 
of the summer season, you can just drive in on Friday afternoon and get a 
spot, at what is arguably one of the most beuatiful valleys in existence. 
Thank God for the foresight of John Muir regarding this mountain paradise:

&gt;In the vast Sierra wilderness far to the southward of the famous Yosemite 
&gt;Valley, there is a yet grander valley of the same kind. It is situated on 
&gt;the south fork of King's River, above the most extensive groves and 
&gt;forests of the giant sequoia, and beneath the shadows the highest 
&gt;mountains in the range, where the canons are deepest and the snow-laden 
&gt;Pus are crowded most closely together It is called the Big King's River 
&gt;Canon, or King's River Yosemite...

&gt;I fancy the time is not distant when this wonderful region will be opened 
&gt;to the world--when a road will be built up the South Fork of King's River 
&gt;through the sequoia groves, into the great cañon, and thence across the 
&gt;divide and down the Middle Fork Cañon to Tehipitee; thence through the 
&gt;valley and down the cañon to the confluence of the Middle and South Forks, 
&gt;and up to the sequoia groves to the point of beginning. Some of the 
&gt;sequoia groves were last year included in the national reservations of 
&gt;Sequoia and General Grant Parks. But all of this wonderful King's River 
&gt;region, together with the Kaweah and Tule sequoias, should be comprehended 
&gt;in one grand national park. This region contains no mines of consequence, 
&gt;it is too high and too rocky for agriculture, and even the lumber industry 
&gt;need suffer no unreasonable restriction. Let our law-givers then make 
&gt;haste before it is too late to set apart this surpassingly glorious region 
&gt;for the recreation and well-being of humanity, and all the world will rise 
&gt;up and call them blessed.

     We arrived at around 3pm on Friday, and our first exciting time 
happened while hunting for a site. We drove through Sheep Creek 
campground, looking for a good site, and couldn't see the water. So, 
wondering how far the sites were from the river, we turned off the bus to 
listen. We heard the water, then we heard a more ominous sound. The 
starter solenoid. Or, more exactly, the click that accompanies the 
starter solenoid failing. It's a fairly common problem with the VW bus. 
You've got 20+ year old wiring, with the starter and the battery at the 
back right side of the bus, and the ignition switch at the front left. 
When things warm up, those 12volts get mighty tired marching from back to 
front to back, and they just give up the ghost. No big deal, you learn to 
think ahead and park on hills and such, or you rewire it. Problem-this is 
the first time our '78 has done this since we've owned it, and it lived 
with us in Austin and Sacramento, not places known for their cool 
temperatures.

     After an easy bump start, we noodled around for a bit, and finally 
settled in on site #66 at Sentinel campground. It's not the best site 
around, but it offered a reasonable amount of shade and met our basic 
needs. The evening's sleep was interrupted several times by folks around 
the campground chasing off bear(s). The following morning we noted 
several folks packing up and leaving, so we scouted for a new site, 
finally settling on #39, which is somewhat closer to the river, and more 
importantly offered lots of lovely shade. While scouting sites, we talked 
to a couple who'd been in the canyon for a week, and they told us of the 
bear troubles. Seems that this is the worst year in the past 8 as far as 
bears are concerned. We came here 4 years ago after being rousted by a 
bear at Lodgepole campground in Sequoia, and never heard or saw one. 
Haven't seen one yet this time either, but we've heard lots of evidence 
every evening. While they often get a bad rap, the Black Bear really 
isn't all that dangerous. All they want is food, and if you keep it(and 
other good smelling stuff, such as toothpaste and deodorant) locked up, 
you're nearly always fine. Assuming you don't do something stupid like 
get to close to cubs, or have the misfortune to run into a whacked bear. 
Very uncommon. Sadly, it seems that the bear problems are here to stay. 
As we move into their territory, they discover how easy it is to steal 
food from us. Once they start the downward cycle to aggressiveness, it 
more often then not ends up in their being trapped and unceremoniously 
shot in the head. If they manage to dodge the bullet, so to speak, and 
instead get relocated to the backcountry, they often die of hunger, as 
they became dependent on people for food and never learned to properly 
forage.

     Saturday was an easy day, just kind of loafing about the camp. When 
Hunter and Sam hit the bus for naptime, SueEllen and I headed for the 
river, fishing poles in hand. A couple of hours later, we came back with 
fishing poles in hand. Nothing else, although the river had claimed one 
lure each. We heard that the big pool out in front of the lodge had some 
good action, but it seems that the fishing hole doubles as a swimming 
hole, so we were out of business for the day.

     Sunday morning we were up bright and early, and heading for the 
fishing/swimming hole. SueEllen still struck out, mainly due to lack of 
decent tackle and waders, but I managed to pull in 2 rather small Rainbow 
Trout on a white roostertail. Later in the day we took a drive to Grizzly 
Falls, then up to Raging River Falls and Road's End, doing the sight 
seeing thing. Finally, we ended up down the river at what looked to be a 
decent fishing hole, which also had a small stretch of sand. We all 
tromped down, I put a plastic worm and a few feet of 4lb test on a stick, 
and Hunter &quot;went fishing with daddy&quot;. Didn't have much of a chance of 
catching anything with a Plastic Nightcrawler (bass size) and no hook, 
but he thought it was good stuff. I tried floating some flies and got 2 
strikes, but didn't get the hook set, and all poor SueEllen got was wet. 
But we all had fun.

     Monday was get up and go day. I crawled out of the sack around 6:45, 
and headed over to the fishing/swimming hole for some last minute 
angling. I've come away with the realization that the successful trout 
fisherman at Kings Canyon should be fly fishing. A variant of the sport I 
have yet to attempt. Loaded up the bus, rolled up the hill. Stopped at 
Kings Canyon Lodge on the way out for some gas. They have these rustic 
gas pumps, from something like the '30s, which are pretty cool to see in 
action. They have a big glass storage tank sitting about 8 feet up, and 
when you pump gas it's simply gravity draining the storage tank, so it's 
totally quiet. There's a gauge inside the glass which shows how many 
gallons have been dispensed. Interesting stuff. They're also your only 
shot for gas in the area, so like any true monopoly they're way 
overpriced. Cost was something like $2.79/Gal, while the state average is 
about $1 less. Cute nonetheless, and better than running of gas out on 
the road.

     Onward we drove, up into Sequoia. Stopped off at Grant Grove, 
checked out the big ol' trees, got pictures of little Hunter next to a 
monster tree, the general tourist thing. Hit the Grant Grove store, saw 
my first newspaper of the weekend. Headline: Sir Alec Guinness dead at 
86. A very sad occurrence for me. I know he didn't think much of the Star 
Wars work, but I loved it nonetheless. While I'm the first to admit that 
Star Wars was, for the most part, repackaged mythology, it was still the 
definitive mythology for me and many of my generation. But death must 
happen to all of us, and Sir Alec lived a long and happy life, from what 
I read. I guess that while we visited in God's country, Sir Alec left for 
a more permanent stay.

     From there on out it was just the run through the San Joaquin 
valley. Fresno and such were hot and miserable, and made me start to 
think seriously about fixing my A/C, but they were over in a few hours. 
Made it home, unpacked, rested. Overall a very enjoyable trip, to a place 
I consider one of the most beautiful in California, a state known for 
it's awe-inspiring scenery. Overall mileage about 550 miles, and a 
flawless performance other than the one starter mishap. More importantly, 
Sam and Hunter both enjoyed the trip, which opens to door to more weekend 
runs into the Sierras. Thinking about Caples Lake next time...  ;-)


Peace,
