Subject: Bus Awning up for grabs

Hi Volks

I bought a bus awning from bus depot *It is Not the EZ awning they
currently sell*

This awning is of heavy material with solid poles, it clips to the rain
gutter so would work for any bus/westy. I am giving it away to the first
person who would like it for free imagine that. I just thought of
sending this email out this morning so I have no pictures of it. I also
went to the bus depot web page to get the description but it looks like
they don't sell it anymore. I personally don't like the design, I am
sure someone would like it though. Seems like a waste to sit at my house
unused. I have never even taken it on a trip, brand new.

So here is the deal first person to email me that they want it gets it,
*Please* only email me for this off list at:

margaret.macarthur_at_montgomerycountymd_dot_gov



As an added bonus if the person who wants the awning so chooses I will
throw in a copy of String Cheese Incident's Hulaween show 10/31/04
Madison, WI that I am burning it tonight:-)



Peace

Meg
