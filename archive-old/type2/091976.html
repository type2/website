Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

I thought I'd post this to both lists as it might save a repeat bad experience

&gt; &gt;From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:
&gt; &quot;...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left wheel came off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the powdercoating

Tragic!.... SOmething I was told before I put the wheels on my vehicles,,,

BEFORE putting freshly painted rims on a vehicle,, REMOVE THE PAINT on the back of the rim where it contacts the brake part,, and from the taper area on the front, where the nut/bolt tightens on,,
This is just a small circle area 

The Reason being,....
The first hard brake application will heat up the drum/rotor enough to make the paint like jelly,, or worse,, and it will squeeze out from between the drum and the rim, and the rim and the nut/bolt
,and you rim will be LOOSE!
