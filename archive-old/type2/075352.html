Subject: Re: [T2] Re: re-winter storage in barns

Yeah, I once saw a hereford driving a panel near Amarillo...I didn't catch
the year, but it must've been a barndoor!
A custom leather interior would send a message if you are really worried
about parking in the barn.


&gt;No problem. Simply plug any holes that are large enough for a cow to enter
&gt;your bus :)
