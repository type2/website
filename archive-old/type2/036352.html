Subject: Re: Bus Pollution 

Not at all sure extensive treatises on this are appropriate
or generally interesting, but as has been said, the energy
cost of manufacture is very substantial and the general 
environmental costs are dominated by the vehicle, not its
fuel use, for many years (with substantial variation, as you
can well imagine).  Further, regulations are based on the
average level of maintenance, etc., which for &quot;our&quot; group
will be a bad match.  Finally, most significant by far
is that the gains in tailpipe emission quality over the
past two decades have been more than wiped out by an increase
in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as measured over the US as
a whole.  In other words, sprawl and congestion are winning.
And, yes, emissions per mile travelled are much worse for
the first few miles (cold start assumed) and there is an
added kick the first few minutes after use (&quot;hot soak&quot;)
when some hydrocarbon boil-off occurs.  If you want to 
base an activism on science, you'll apply pressure on land
use issues and population growth, but I'm sure I'm touching
hot buttons now...
