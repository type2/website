Subject: THE PEACE BUS IS SILENT!
Message-ID: &lt;e61255ae.2460bda6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Greetings Everyone, my first message, If I mess it up tell me so, looking for 
some advice, any and everything. I'll try to keep this short, somehow.  The 
PEACE BUS, my 1976 Deluxe Campmobile, 2l F.I. is under the weather., Recently 
removed motor as I had a 'soft plug&quot; blow out the back of the case and the 
EXXON Valdez was relived in my garage.  After putting the motor back in, and 
not having a leaking case, and everything (?) back together correctly, the 
PEACE BUS won't start.  I'm guessing something fuel related, as I drop a bit 
of starter fluid in a cylinder and it fires right away, only for a second.  
Fuel pump humms when I crank motor.  To the best of my knowledge, I have all 
the lines back together correctly.  The Camper ran fine before the VALDEZ 
spill, no troubles whatsoever.  I've checked the wires on the starter (OK) 
it'll crank forever.   Ground wires near #3 OK.  Fuel makes it to the 
injectors, but I dont think into the cylinders, I smell NO gas when cranking 
cranking cranking.....!.... 

   After browsing thru my BENTLEY manual, I'm thinking might be something w/ 
dual relay?.... I do have a mystery wire that comes from the starter, which I 
dont think was ever hooked up to anything.  It is not stock, someone added it 
on but perhaps I overlooked it.  This is my first BUS, and I'm losing a bit 
of my sanity trying to fix the old girl.  If someone can give me a few 
suggestions for me to double check or test, I'd REALLY appreciate it.  Thanks 
for your time people~~~~~~

On another note, I have a hammock, bars and canvas in good shape, bars are 
56-1/4&quot; that I'd like to trade for someone who might have a set for my 
CAMPMOBILE that requires 57&quot; bars. 

THANKS!
BRAD 76 DELUXE CAMPMOBILE
