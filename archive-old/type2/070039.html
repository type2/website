Subject: brake booster trouble

Volks,

Well sure as I spouted off to Sami about how wonderful the breadloaf brakes
are, now they are giving me a bit of trouble.

Status:

New front calipers, pads, hoses, system bled.  Was stopping great until a
couple of days ago.  Master cylinder replaced about 2 years ago.

Symptoms:

Increased pedal effort
Pedal gets stiff (shuddup Steve!) immediately after the motor is shut off
(didn't used to, and doesn't in other cars I've owned).

First, I suspected a vacuum leak.  I checked all of the hoses, replaced one
that was questionable.  No change.  I then pulled the vacuum hose at the
brake booster with the engine running.  LOTS of vacuum there, and motor
made confidence-inspiring noises (i.e. idle got rough and increased speed
when the hose was open, smoothed down when I put my thumb over it).  So, I
am sure there is no problem with vacuum up to the brake booster.

Now I suspect the brake booster.  I drove the bus with the vacuum line
disconnected and plugged, and the brakes were a little stiffer, but not
much.  I think the booster is helping somewhat, but something is definately
wrong.  I pulled the vacuum hose at the firewall and sucked on it (shut UP
STEVE!) and there was some slight, constant resistance.  With the hose
connected, the engine smooths out pretty well (maybe not as well as when
the line was plugged, hard to say) and I can't hear any obvious leaks
around the booster (although it's hard to hear it with the engine running).

I would feel more confident in my diagnosis if I could find the leak in the
booster, but I think I am sure enough to go ahead and rebuild/replace it.

The problem is, I was quoted $395 for a new brake booster by Vee Parts
(umm... yeah right!) and they said they don't list a kit or a rebuilt.
They suggested the junkyard.  Has anyone ever taken theirs apart?  Anyone
know of a source for parts for it?  I'd appreciate any advice the list can
give.  I guess I'll have to take it out, see if I can find the problem, and
scour the junkyards for a replacement (around here, that could take a
while).

Thanks in advance,

- -David
