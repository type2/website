&gt; I put my 81 in the shop last week to check my brakes and was told on Sat. that
&gt; I needed new rotors and best price was $129 ea. Told them to hold on while I
&gt; checked Bus Depot's page and found the rotors at $49ea. Got Ron on the phone
&gt; at noon Monday and damned if the things weren't delivered the next day!
&gt; 
&gt; Ron's a bitch to get on the phone at times but the prices are outstanding and
&gt; this is my second experience with excellent hurry up service. Do some business
&gt; with him.

Am I the only person who hasn't had such a great expierience with them?

first they sent me the wrong seal, and took months to finally send me
the right thing (it was just an engine seal), and now I've been waiting
3 weeks for my muffler.... and the price was the same as mid-america
designs.... 

I seem to remember getting a mail from the list with something like &quot;hey
Ron, where's my exhaust&quot; or something at the bottom... I thought it was
funny before (I had only been waiting a week)

I'm figuring this is one of those things that gets drop shipped from
RMMW- does it always take this long?
