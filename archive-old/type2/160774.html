Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Pulley Failure

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have an interesting predicament.  For the second time in ~3 years, my alternator pulley has &gt;failed and in an interesting way:  the inner radius of the front (FIF) side of the pulley has sheared &gt;off from the outer radius.

ISTR there was a thread about this a while back, although a quick
search of the archives didn't bear any fruit.  I think the most common
theory was that the belt was too tight and would wedge the sheave
apart slightly, leading to metal fatigue and failure of the pulley
around the hub.

CIP1 carries both 900 and 905mm belts, their catalog specifies the
900mm belt for 6v, so it seems plausible you might have the smaller
belt.

&gt; The last time this happened was on a different motor and different alternator, but the same fan &gt;shroud.  That was about 12,000-15,000 miles ago.

I think the tin is what determines the top pulley position, so mixing
and matching parts might result in pulley alignment problems.  It
seems to me an easy way to check the alignment would be to use one of
those cheap laser pointers held in the vee of one pulley- the beam
should hit the center of the second sheave if they are in alignment.
Take care not to blind yourself or others, of course.
