Subject: my tire 2 cents

I just had an old XZX (185R14C) blow out on a friend's bus last month, not
fun especially since the town I limped to on the rotten XZX spare only had
Load range B passenger tires, had to get home. . . XZX's are all getting old
by now . . .

JUST ordered 2 Vredestein Comtrac 185R14C all-season tires for my bus.  $94
each plus shipping from NJ.  Reinforced van tyres, Load range D, load index
102 (1870 lbs).  I will let you know how they turn out.  Pmail me for
details.

By the way, these are replacing some &quot;heavy duty&quot; LT 205/75's that REALLY
suck in terms of stability. Load range C, 1570 lb, but soft sidewalls, it
really dives in the corners (scary).

&gt;My old tyres were Michelin XZX's from 1991, they were
&gt;reinforced, lasted well, still had good tread, but the
&gt;sidewalls were getting soft and dry-rotted.. I needed
&gt;tyres in a hurry after noticing that one was about to
&gt;&quot;let go&quot;, and I was running around on my spare.. In
&gt;hindsight they really were like driving on
&gt;mashmallows!!
