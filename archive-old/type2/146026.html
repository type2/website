&lt;&lt; Thanks for all the suggestions. My neighbor gave me another one to pass
&gt; along similar to the Irish Spring Soap.  She said to leave a box of
&gt; moth balls in the center of the bus with a few holes punched in it.
&gt; She said that this will also prevent vermin from taking up residence. &gt;&gt;

My buddy's company has a small warehouse on Watts St (Waaay downtown,
NYC) and another company was doing demolition nearby...They've got a
Sprinter but it often sits for weeks between use...Last time they went to
start it, it wouldn't. Since it was still under warranty, it was towed back
to the dealer for service...Long story short: Rats from the demolition
site had taken up residence in the truck and were eating the wiring... ;-(
