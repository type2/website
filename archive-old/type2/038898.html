OK, here's a simple solution using only one DPDT switch:


IGNITION--------------        -------
                       \    /         \
                   -----|--|--         |
                   | O  0  0 |          \
      DPDT switch  |         |            ------RADIO POWER WIRE
                   | 0  O  O |          /
                   -/---|-----         |
                   |   /               |
ALWAYS HOT---------|--                 |
                   |                   |
                    \                 /
                      ---------------

DPDT switches are available at your FLAPS or Radio Schlock

with the switch in one position, you get radio with ignition on.  With the
switch in the other position, you get radio all the time.  It doesn't
affect any other electrics.
