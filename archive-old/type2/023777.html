Hi,

&gt; Just got on the motorway when the engine suffered a loss of power and the
&gt; van started to cut out and the acceleration was completely non-existent.
&gt; ...
&gt; I could only get the van up to about 30 -35 in third
&gt; and limp a long.
&gt; I eventually made it off the motorway and parked up. Their was excessive
&gt; smoke coming out of the exhaust at idle.
&gt; I have had a rebuild to take unleaded (with hardened valves) about two
years
&gt; ago and have done around 6000 miles on this engine and have a service
every
&gt; 6 months in which time I would do no more then 2000 miles.

&gt; Has anyone any ideas what the problem could be ?

 I'd start with the basics- given that it was running, and not making any 
horrible noises, it's probably not catastrophic. First place to look would
be the electrical system (rule one of car breakdowns: &quot;It's always
electrical&quot;).

 So: do you have good spark? Timing right? Pull the plugs and check the 
electrodes for carbonisation- that might tie the problem to a particular
cylinder. Check compression while you're there.
 Try changing the coil.

 I'm guessing that this is a 1600cc upright, since a pancake wouldn't
have needed a rebuild for unleaded (or a fanbelt, as such).
 Is your choke OK? Fuel filter blocked?

 Where are you, BTW?

Cheers,
	W.

PS It's worth being explicit about engine configuration, since most of the 
   listees are US based, and a '79 would have had a 2.0l Fuel Injected
pancake
   engine in that market.
