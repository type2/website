&gt; In my experience the dipstick has been a good indicator of engine temps.
&gt; If it's too hot to touch for more than a few seconds, then it's probably

&gt; try and fix it.

I must have sensitive fingers, as my dipstick is always a bit too hot to
hold after a summer run.

My test is to get a blob of spit on my finger and to apply it to the case
above and to the left of the pulley, where the oil gallery runs.  If it
sizzles, it's too hot.  If it bubbles, it is warm, and if it just sits
there and evaporates it is fine,
