6 months ago I purchased a '79 camper, which has run me around without too 
many problems so far. I have not really done any work or checks upon my van 
apart from change the oil, leads and air filter.
I will be shortly have some money to spend. Can anyone tell me what are the 
first things to examine should be to keep her going strong.
I have had trouble with the engine dying and stalling on longer journeys and 
the dreaded rust is creeping in under the front doors, one of the arches, 
and around the windscreen seal.

Can anybody help?

Cheers

Dave, England
