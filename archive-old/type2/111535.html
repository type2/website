Subject: Re: [T2] Painting rims

Now for painting, does anyone have a
&gt; suggestion for the type of paint to use that will
last?

Rust-O-Leum rocks, but if you can barrow a sprayer
that would be best.

This way you can use automotive single stage paint, I
suggest PPG Urethane, you can walk in any paint house
and just tell them you want a cash walk in account
price, and you should be able to score a quart for
around $25 + hardner + reducer. Still under $50 for
the works...

Still cant get a spray gun, minimum of 3 coats
rust-o-leum..

good luck,
rob
