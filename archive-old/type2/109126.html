Subject: Fuel Tank Sender

I have a 1977 Westy 2.0L Carbed.

The fuel gauge shows full when you fill up, then works it's way down to
empty. On the next fill up I only manage to get approx. 25 litres in the
tank, so having a tank capacity of 56 litres, it would appear thet my gauge
is showing empty when only half empty, no real problem as I just reset the
odometer each fill up and then track the mileage.

Question is is it the sender causing the problem, sticking or something, or
could it be the actual gauge?

Thanks

Andy Vines
