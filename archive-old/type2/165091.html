Subject: [T2] Electric conversion -- resources?

Thanks, Greg...
                Yep, I wonder myself what horsepower will be required... gotta 
do some more calcs using freshman physics ;-))

As to energy usage,
       1 hp = 746 watts (theoretically) so 7.5 hp = 5595 watts
so
     5595 watts = 180 volts times X amps...  X = 31.08 amps

OK, so the current would be easy to handle; ignore for now the damage you could 
do to yourself with 180 volts DC.  My commute is particularly easy, taking 
maybe 16 minutes for 8 miles at 30 mph.   16/60 = 0.26666... hours

thus the energy used would be
     31.08 amps times 0.26666 hours = 8.3 ampere hours,

fairly easy (I think) for the common auto battery, which IIRC is rated around 
100-150 ampere-hours.  Still don't know if 7.5 horses will propel the bus at 30 
mph... must do some more calculating.  Obviously the gradients on the road will 
figure in.  And I still don't know what to do for a control system... but it is 
getting to be more interesting.  Thanks for your participation.  I'll check the 
FleaBay listing you mentioned :-))

Hi Glenn,

A very quick number-crunching tells me that one motor per rear wheel  
gets you 20HP total power available. I don't think that will be  
sufficient to move a 3,000lb vehicle with a relatively high  
coefficient of drag at typical commuting velocity. But I could be  
wrong; maybe there's someone else here with more knowledge about  
electric motors.

FWIW, there is an electric VW Bus on eBay right now that has a motor  
rated at 23HP, and it has a rated top speed of 48MPH. See item  
#320137127199 for additional specs.
