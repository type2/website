I pointed out the Westie of my dreams to my 6-year-old daughter. &quot;Cool,&quot;
she said. &quot;You could paint flames on it.&quot;

What a great idea! Here's how I'd do it: ( http://www.west_dot_net/~phoutz )

Unfortunately it's going to take a while to scratch up the assests to
realize this dream. Anybody have a '74 Westie they want to trade for an
'85 Toyota Tercel 4 x 4? Some decent photography and web design? A
year's worth of yard work?

(Oh well, I may not get the bus, but I'm bound to get the flames.
*sigh*)
