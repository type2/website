Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [T2} help me!!! he cries.....intermittent loss of
  power

Bob,

Ah...ha   2/3 power, not total loss.....
Time to pull those injectors and send them off to Richard's favorite 
place...?cruizin performance? for a total cleaning?

Injector going bad?....thought about driving around with
1 injector wire disconnected at a time for a little while?

And I forgot one....

How about checking ground and mounting tightness of the ECU?

And unplugging it and replugging it in case you have any corrosion on the 
contact pins.

You might think about connecting a light bulb or something similar
around the ign switch to the wire that goes back to to the coil....you 
know alligator clips and just look at it when the power loss 
occurs.....just for fun.

Yes, it would be really nice if you could have someone looking at the fuel 
pressure when it does it.  That's how I finally found out about my gas 
tank crud when I had a similar problem.


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Bob,
&gt; 
&gt; I have metal hoses, flexible mesh stainless steel hoses from tank to pump
&gt; and most other places. they will fail not collapse
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2.  Something floating around in the tank that covers up the intake.
&gt; 
&gt; ??hmmm??
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3.  Tank vent hole plugged or covered?
&gt; 
&gt;  ?? hmmm hadnt thought of that
&gt; 



&gt; doesn't fully cut out just loses 2/3 of it's power or so never 100%




&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Q.  Better or worse in the heat/cold?
&gt; 
&gt; nope
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Q.  Better or worse over smooth or bumpy roads?
&gt; 
&gt; no difference.  have wiggled every wire and hose and plug I know of while
&gt; running, no change
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Q.  When this happens, and you take it out of gear, does it die or idle?
&gt; 
&gt; it',s an automatic so that is a little harder. but will give it a try.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
