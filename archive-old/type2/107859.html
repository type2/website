Subject: VIRUS UPDATE

Hello,

I recently found out about the BUGBEAR virus because it was brought to my
attention that some of the listees were receiving strange attachments and
where the messages were&quot;FROM&quot; were being faked by this virus.I recognized
the attachment as being an exhaust calculation for a project I worked on, &quot;KPG
exhaust.&quot;
I have located the virus and it has been removed from my computer.
Thanks to all that showed their support and gave helpful advise.

Darren
