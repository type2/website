I recently spoke to Jim Thompson (of Old Volks Home fame) about this same
problem with these studs (he was passing thru the other day) and gave me
the following info from his database on these exhaust studs, thought it
might be beneficial to all the listees:

VW Part Number		Size

N 14 684 1		8 x 9 x 56mm Long, 1.8 &amp; 2.0 Engines

N 14 427 7		8 x 53mm Long, 1.7 Engines

N 14 483 1		8 x 10 x 38 Long, 1600 and Waterboxer

These listings are taken directly from the VW Parts Fiche.  These are still
available from the VW Dealer (he says), but they're rather pricey.
Although he's no longer selling parts at this time (unfortunate), he says
that Bus Boys (530-244-1616) in Redding should still be carrying them at a
much better price (he says he added these to their inventory some years
back when he was with them).  Give them a call, they just may be able to
help.  Most FLAPS I've dealt with carry the 8x10x38 (Dorman is the most
common supplier to them). 

Unfortunately, he did not have the VW Number for the oversized (8x10x56 [or
is it 53?]) stud for stripped out 1.7/1.8/2.0 heads.  He also said he
wasn't aware of an 8x9x38 Step Stud (proper term I guess) for repair and
implicated it was a rather &quot;bastard&quot; size, even for the longer one factory
installed on the 1.8/2.0 heads.  The VW Parts Fiche says to use the 8x10x38
when replacing stripped exhaust studs on the 1.6 and Waterboxers.  I have
no idea what the thread pitch on the 10mm portion of the stud.  I'll take a
look and measure when I get my hands on one.

Actually I prefer using the Timeserts someone else mentioned on the list.
They are light-years ahead of reliability more than the most sophisticated
of heli-coils (ugh!)

FWIW and I hope this helps :-)
