Subject: Check valve

I can blow through the check valve I have in the direction of the
arrow. It blocks in the other direction.

Bentley says that the arrow on the check valve must point towards the
booster.

??? Is there a mistake in Bentley ??? I 'd think to generate vacuum in
booster, engine needs to suck air from within the booster, hence the
check valve must let air from the booster to the engine. That would
mean arrow points to the engine and NOT booster.

Please help fixing my brain !!
