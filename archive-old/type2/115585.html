Subject: Re: Weber ICT vs Solex Carbs

I know nothing about carbs but I ditched my stock Solex carbs about 7 years
ago.  They were a mess.  The heavy fuel cutoff jet was JB welded in.  It had
no accelorator jets and a big hesitation problem.  I had them &quot;rebuilt&quot;.
They were super for a few days.  Than I must of hit a big bump and they went
right out of adjustment just like always.  The last straw was when they ate 
the new set of
accelorator jets that were installed when they were rebuilt...See ya...
Since then I have been running the Weber 34ICT
(on 1.8 litre engine).  I know nothing about jetting so I didn't jet them.
This is on my list of things to do.  They work great, no hesitation, decent 
mileage and
performance.  Best of all they are rock steady.  I sync them, set them and
leave them alone.  The only things I miss about my old carbs are the
automatic chokes and the stock air cleaner.  I have read that for 1.8 litre
and up you need a bigger carb (Muir performance section?).  Though the 34
ICT doesn't seem to offer any big performance advantage over the Solex, I am
happy with mine because of the increased reliability and ease of adjustment
which are the reasons I bought them in the first place.  If your stock carbs
are in good condition, this is something to consider.  Hope this helps,
James.
