-------Original Message-------


that happened with mine when my battery went flat overnight (due to faulty
voltage regulator - so possibly check this) and when i got a jump start from
the road service guys and they didn't put the cables in the right spot
so again possibly check all the wiring is good and going to the right
connections

try jumping or clutching it and see whether it has something to do with the
battery
