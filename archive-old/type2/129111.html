Subject: ASSEMBLING 1800 ANSWERED

Hello,

I had my questions answered.
1. It does not matter on an 1800 engine which number
is facing up, these connecting rods do not have a forge mark,
therefore you can install these either way.
2. yes, you install the oil seal &amp; sealing ring at the fan end after the
case is together. and the seal at the flywheel end after the case is
together. luckily this was not a test to the list because no one had the
answers.

Darren
