If I'm not mistaken, friction from the stuck pad caused the brake fluid to
heat up (and therefore expand)which would cause the pedal action to be high.
I'm no expert but it seems reasonable to believe that sustained high temps
aren't very good for brake fluid and would make me consider bleeding the
system.

Subject: Brake problem


&gt; I was driving along in my '79 Van and noticed smoke coming from the back -
&gt; when I stopped it seemed to have been coming from the back wheel and there
&gt; was a kind of burning rubber smell - as the problem after inspection was
&gt; obviously not coming from the tyre I assumed it was something like the
&gt; brake pad sticking.
&gt;
&gt; I pressed the brake in a few times which seemed to unstick the brake pad
&gt; and drove on - I then noticed that there was something weird going on with
&gt; the braking action when using the brake pedal. The braking point on the
&gt; pedal constantly changed from the normal position to right near the top
&gt; (although luckily actually bringing the van to a stop was the same as
normal).
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas what the problem could be ?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
