I agree, so avoid the cleaner when driving a new bus home that have been
sitting a long time. New fuel lines eliminate the problem except for the 4
metal lines. Do those vanish on the inside with prolonged storage? My guess
is probably not since the bulk of the fuel is held behind thee pump and
filter.
