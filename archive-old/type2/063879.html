Subject: removing dust cap on front wheels?

Since I have to replace the front hoses, I might as well do a few other
things &quot;while I'm there.&quot; There's some axial play in my front wheels and I
would like to repack the wheel bearings, but I can't get those darn dust
caps off. Any suggestions?

TIA,

Sami
