Subject: pmail  [T2] how do you do it?

Richard,

Something I have noticed for a while now.  When I get ready to reply to 
you posts, the standard attached block at the bottom goes away 
automatically...I don't have to snip it..

How did you do that????

I'm on Linux using Pine...

Cheers, dave

&gt; There is a repetitive noise that's been driving me nuts lately and I seemed
&gt; to have traced it to one of my Continental CR21 tires that I bought 2 years
&gt; ago.
&gt; 
&gt; If I rotate tires, the noise moves with the tire. I'm not sure what to be
&gt; glad of at this point although it's sort of a relief it's not CV or bearing
&gt; noise. Anyway, the tire looks perfectly fine to the eye.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had a similar experience?
&gt; 
&gt; PS. Along with proper tire inflation, keep the front end lubed. It makes
&gt; steering so much easier. I always forget about this.
