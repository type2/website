&gt; We might be talking about two different things.  I think you're
referring 
to roller rocker arms.  Those are part of it, but I also want hydraulic 
roller lifters, i.e. like regular hydraulics but with a little wheel on
the 
end that rolls over the cam lobe.  With these, you can run cams with
much 
steeper ramp rates and higher lift and not worry about wear.  To run
roller 
lifters though, you have to have a mechanism to prevent the lifters from

rotating in the bore.  
&gt;
_________________________________

You're right, the word valvetrain threw me. To engineer this you'd
probably have to work out some sort of grooved or slotted sleeves to
install in drilled out lifter holes, and redesign the lifters themselves
with a tenon (?) or even sprung rollers that ride in the grooves. Way
beyond me, but brother, put that together with the roller rockers and
would that motor purr, or what?

This would almost certainly involve major 
modifications to the case itself and some new parts, but it would open
up a 
whole new world of engine longevity and performance.  Like fuel
injection 
and electronic ignition, roller lifters are now (I'm pretty sure) in the

majority of new cars sold in the US.  I want them in my bus!

I did a google search on &quot;roller lifters vw&quot; and found some indications 
that other people have thought about this in the past (Gary Miller,
Pauter 
Machine).  I wish I had a fistful of cash to throw at one of those guys.
