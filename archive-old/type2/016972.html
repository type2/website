Short is an electrical term for a direct path between battery
plus and battery negative.  You don't have a short.

It probably isn't the alternator because other things continued
to work.

Possibly loose wire, but I would suspect either a defective
light switch or a fuse that is heating in the holder and breaking
contact when it gets hot.

Turn on the lights and put your finger on the back side of the
light switch.  If it get's hot to the touch, replace it.  Same with
the fuses.  But since both lights went out, it is probably not the
fuse because there is a separate fuse for each headlight.

Good luck

&gt; Fellow Listees
&gt; Last night on the way home a very weird thing happened and I could use
&gt; some advise from the list before I go to the local Mechanic.
&gt; As I traveled the freeway at a steady 65 mph the head lights went out!
&gt; Not the dash lights or the radio, just the headlights. I was within
&gt; yards of an exit that would take me home so I
&gt; pulled off. As I continued on the exit ramp the lights went ON! and all
&gt; was fine. About 1/4 of a mile later the lights went out again and then
&gt; back on. This happened two more times then the lights stayed on for the
&gt; remainder of the ride home.
&gt; Q. Do I have a short?
&gt; Q  Is this my Alternator?
&gt; Q  Do I have a loose wire?
&gt; Q. Can I replace the Alt without removing the engine?
&gt;
&gt; Has this happened to anyone else? Or does the bus have Gremlins?
&gt; Thanks for any help!
