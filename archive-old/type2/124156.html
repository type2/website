Hi Max ~~~

Sounds like you are up on making the spark strong, and that's good. Get
Bosch everything!
My experience to vastly improve mileage was cleaning out the oil bath air
filter. I went from 17 to 22 mpg on the highway.
I also learned to take it easy on the gas pedal, and that further improved
highway mileage. Leaving it in gear while cruising downhill, I was getting
26.6 mpg from Charlottesville VA to the VA-NC border stop at Pleasant Hill,
NC. I had also taken out the icebox/sink combo to save weight on the Myrtle
Beach to NYC trip, ultimately getting over 18 mpg (with two adults, three
kids and packed to the gills with luggage &amp; food).

&gt; Hi fellow bus owners,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have been searching the Archives for way's to improve the gas mileage
&gt; and the only thing I have come across is to install a new ignition
&gt; system such as a Petronix. Does that work? I am currently getting about
&gt; 17mpg which I have gleaned from the archives is not terrible but I want
&gt; more. Does the grand list have any ideas about ways to improve fuel
&gt; economy?
