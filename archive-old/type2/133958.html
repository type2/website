Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

&quot;DO NOT leave this stuff on your skin - get it off while its still
wet and can be removed.  I've worked with all kinds of paints, 
fiberglass resins, etc over the years, but this stuff is dangerous.&quot; 

I don't know about &quot;dangerous&quot;, unless you're breathing the vapours for
hours on end. When it gets on your skin and dries, it won't come off for
sure, but you just have to wait until your skin naturally sloughs off -
about 4-7 days, usually. Don't bother with the solvents..even acetone
won't take it off your skin when it dries, and washing your hands in
acetone isn't the greatest idea anyway. As Robert suggests, however,
gloves and avoiding skin contact in the first place is really the best
idea. 

I just sandblasted and painted all my engine tin with POR-15, and I've
been amazed and how durable it seems already. Plenty of times during
reassembly, I've slipped, scratched, dropped wrenches, and otherwise
traumatized my prettily repainted tin, and nary a mark. Almost like it's
powdercoated! I get the sense that this stuff will last for years to come.
And it looks great.
