Subject: The &quot;4 legged stool&quot;

Ok, here I am again, Mr. correct terminology, here to put this thread to rest. 
A &quot;jumpseat&quot; is a REAR FACING SEAT in the passenger compartment that has a
BACKREST of some sorts to it and is held in place by either some sort of
latching mechanism ( as per Vanagon Carat) or the bottom half is bolted to the
floor, and the part you sit yer but on lifts up to reveal storage underneath (
as per most pre '74 westy's and a few Vanagon non-GL wolfsburg Weekender
Westy's. )

The little freestanding &quot;4 legged stool&quot; as it is called was offered on all
westy's until '74. on the '74 models there were vinyl straps on the inside of
the front seats (near the seatbelts to anchor it in place. These straps were
often short lived, as after the stool is commandeered from the westy to serve
the rest of it's life in the original owners workshop as a ashtray stand or as a
&quot;chewy toy&quot; for the family pit bull,  ( it is inevitable) the straps were ripped
off by the 2nd owner &quot;wut du hell are these damn things&quot; .  All the 4 legged
stools were covered in the beige naugahide (smoothgrain vinyl) up until '74 and
those were plaid covered in either orange plaid, or blue/green plaid - standard,
and deluxe models, respectively.  The reason it is referred to as the &quot;4 legged
stool&quot; is so as to not confuse it with the &quot;console box&quot; (the fake wood veneered
box w/ plaid covered lid offered on the '75-'79 deluxe Westy's.) I've heard
these boxes referred to incorrectly as trash cans, and the spookiest yet,.... a
potty!   (&quot; uh, honey where'd you put the map?&quot; &quot; It's in the the potty, dear&quot;).
