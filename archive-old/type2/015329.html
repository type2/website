&gt;&gt; Do you still have the heat shield in place above the muffler? I last saw
&gt;&gt; one of those about 1984 here in the rust belt! I might reflect a bit of
&gt;&gt; heat back toward the pavement, though!
&gt;
&gt;actually pieces of mine made it to about 1994 or so, but by then it mostly
&gt;was an asbestos containment site... finally left it on some road
&gt;somewhere???  have no idea where it fell off.   haven't seen one since.

The other unobtainable that relates to this is the strap that binds
the muffler in place. I've been using stainless wire to replace them,
like about 15 laps over and around and over and around......

VERY un DM.
