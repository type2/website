Subject: Re: She RUNS! But things do not fit. :-(  69 westie

&gt; Would this solve this problem? It seems I have seen the bug exhaust work for
&gt; others. Is it a 1969 thing?

Nope..its a bus thing.  The traditional method of making a bug muffer fit
involves one of two things.

a: add cutouts to the bumper.

b: stand on the tailpipes till the muffler fits.

of course, the correct thing to do is to use a bus muffler...if your hatch
seal is anything except perfect, you can expect to suck exhaust fumes into
the interior of the bus with the bug muffler.

...david

i think the single most important reproduction rubber should be the
windshield seal. is there any hope of seeing these done properly? jeez,
since bogus wcm windshied rubber is flubber, isn't a spanking new floor mat
encouraging floor rust? seems like painting the walls before the ceiling...
