Subject: RE: [T2] General BD tent questions and floor vs no floor
  question

That is great input, thanks. It sounds like it is decently sized. It is hard
to tell from the BD website how big it really is. Do you have any pics of it
attached to your bus?

What is the tent channel on split buses? I have a bay, so I guess I don't have
this. Is this going to make a major difference with the way it seals to the
bus? I would like to have a good seal around the bus for sure.

I have been wondering a little about the flat ceiling part of the tent that
connects to the bus. Like you said, it looks like water would pool there.

The part of the tent that connects to the bus, does it come up to the bottom
of the sliding door or is it just open to the underneath of the bus? I have a
little one that will immediately crawl under the bus if give the chance :)

Thank,
Corbett
