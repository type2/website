&gt;&gt;up the high pressure fuel ring. (Incidently, VW changed to steel lines
&gt;&gt;from the left side to the cold start injector and from the cold start
&gt;&gt;injector to the right side in about 77 or 78 so if anyone has an earlier
&gt;&gt;car that hasn't already incinerated itself this would be a really good
&gt;&gt;upgrade. I never had a fuel pump fail, but if you're traveling any
&gt;

Actually we've been through fuel lines a whole bunch of times, but FWIW I
consider this a negative upgrade and would not do it.  To me it seems the
short rubber pieces joining the steel lines are subject to much more
mechanical stress and vibration, have twice the number of clamps and hence
potential leakage points, and are of course subject round here to rust, not
so bad on the straight ring main runs Al is referring to, but scary on the
actual injector pieces which you can't avoid and particularly on exterior
exposed steel lines that run tank to fuel pump.  The change was in '78 along
with the addition of insulation under the fuel tank (another negative that
holds water and causes rust) and the real trendy flapper valve exhaust pipes
that duct heat away from under the tank area when the heat is off (real neat
but the flapper valves with little ducting to fit these are NLA, when VW
replaced my exchanges, flappers, etc for asbestos (he, he) I almost thought
about bitching that I had been safety downgraded, was hoping for the last
set of NOS '78-'79 flapper valves out of some treasure store somewhere.)
Anyway personally I would not strive to retrofit steel ring main lines under
any circumstances, a good German rubber FI line of your personal choice,
cloth or rubber covered, replaced every 5 years or so will keep your bus
from toasting indefinitely.  I have in fact retrofit air cooled Vanagons in
the reverse direction, I simply don't like the way those steel lines force
extreme bends in the rubber junction pieces.  Plus even the addition of more
quality rubber line is largely offset by the price of saving half the amount
of good clamps.  However if you perform the &quot;downgrade&quot; you'd be wise to
locate a set of the grey sleeving that is used on the systems that feature
only rubber line.  Something to consider about all of this is that VW too
abandoned the steel pieces come time of the Wasserboxer in '83 and went back
to sleeved rubber lines connecting the ring main with plastic pieces for the
injectors, something I've never seen fail but which worry me a bit as they
approach 15 years (particularly as they were once replaced under recall.)
I'd also note that at this same time or perhaps in late '77 was the
&quot;upgrade&quot; to a steel line running through the firewall, which again we've
been though mutiple times, THIS IS WHAT BURNS YOU BUS DOWN.  EVERY Bus or
Vanagon I've seen has featured that line cut half through.  The earlier ring
main piece that stops short with a rubber line through is again actually
better IMHO if you watch the grommet and replace the fuel line every 5
years.  However the best upgrade here is a true bulkhead fitting of some
style, perhaps the Hoover fix here as well with a sleeve around the stock
steel tube.
