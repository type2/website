Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Everywhere!!!!

Hiya Courtney,

The fact that your starter and heater hose are covered with oil is 
interesting.  Both of these parts lay &quot;ahead&quot; of the engine.  And although 
one would normally expect oil to be spilled or dripped backward along a 
forward moving vehicle all kinds of weird situations are possible.  Is it 
possible you might have a leaky tranny?  Anyway, since the oil is &quot;ahead&quot; of 
the engine I would second Andy's suggestion of cleaning up the mess as best 
you can, refill the crankcase, and check for leak spots.

And the shaking and vibration as you let out on the clutch would suggest that 
the pressure plate and flywheel might also be oil-soaked.  By all means check 
your clutch cable and its adjustment.  But if nothing comes of that you can 
bank on pulling the engine to get at the clutch assembly.  Might be rear seal 
time!
