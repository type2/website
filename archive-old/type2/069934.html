hey now,

there was kind of a general interest picture in the Metro section of the
News and Observer today. showed a guy sunbathing on the right side, and the
nose of what i assume is a splittie because the way the bumper looked.
definitely a vw van though. was kinda kewl...gonna cut it out and keep it
i reckon'.

ya'll take care,

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Rumba...who wants her picture in the paper)
