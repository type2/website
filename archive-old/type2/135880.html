Subject: Re: [T2] METAL TAG

Hiya Jamie,

I too have found such a metal tag in one of my Bugs.  It was also found under 
a seat.  The tag was about one fourth and inch by one and a half inches.  The 
numbers on my tag were the last seven numbers of my VIN.  I suspect, at least 
in my case, that during production this tag was attached to a subassembly 
(perhaps the seats) which was to be installed in my particular car.
