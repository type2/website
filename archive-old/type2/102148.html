Subject: [T2] Vacuum lines unclear

The temp piece--
http://www.a2zautoforums_dot_com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=12245#post12245 --
seems to mount in the block on top at the base of cyl. 3 right were the tin
ends. from the fit of things, I would say that the mystery hose from the Y
in the pipe going to the brake booster goes to this temp switch (mystery
part) and then the EGR valve. Not to say this is correct, but it appears
that it was connected this way in the past.

Now, I am not sure of where to connect the vacuum retard from the
distributor?


&gt;I believe this Y is a piece only installed on busses with AT. Someone else
&gt;on the list had a problem recently with this tee on his 76 and he had a
&gt;screw shoved in the hose. His engine died when he removed it because he had
&gt;a MT and there was no where for the hose to go: major vacuum leak.

&gt;If you have a MT like he has, you'll need to block off the hose because
it's
&gt;a transplant from another bus, otherwise the 3.5mm hose hooks up to the
&gt;vacuum unit on the AT.

&gt;Did you figure out where the temperature switch (022 131 519) goes? I
wonder
&gt;if it's for the transmission also...
