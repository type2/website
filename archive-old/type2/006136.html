Subject: Follow up to Magnetic Oil Drain Plug OK?

Thanks to everyone for the advice on the Magnetic oil drain plug.  The
concenses is it's OK, but might not be worth the trouble.  The reason I was
interested in the first place is that I just bought a rebuilt engine from
AVP I want to catch as much metal as possible when I start it up for the
first time.

Anyway, I'm going to give it at try and let you all know if there's a
problem.  If anyone else want to try them, I bought my M14-1.50 magnetic
drain plug at Checker for about $3.

Ray
