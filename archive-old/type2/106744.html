Subject: Re: [T2] RE: strange tire wear pattern

volks

I just had my rear tires off to change the brake shoes and noticed that
the very inner corner of the tires were wearing much faster than the rest,
I'm not talking the inner 1/3 or so but just on the corner of the tread,
less than 1/10 of the width.  

bus is not splayed at the rear and seems to be riding correctly, tires
have correct air preasure, at the high end of the range even.

???
