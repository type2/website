Subject: Re: [T2] Por15 question

Hi Tom,

    I've used the Por 15 tank sealer on several tanks over the past few 
years with great results except one!  As long as you do all the messy stuff 
outside in the shed. I see no reason you can't bring it in side to dry, I 
bring all mine inside.  The sealer itsself doen't smell very much at all, 
its mostly the prep products like the metal ready that have a odor, but none 
of it is that strong imho compared to most paint products.  The most 
important thing to watch out for is draining off the excess sealer once the 
tank is thourougly coated.  some tanks are easier than others.  The vw tanks 
are usually pretty good.  It was a ford tank I had problems with since it 
was near impossible to drain all the excess off, still worked out ok 
thought.
Mike
