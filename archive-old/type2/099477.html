Subject: Re: [T2] Books on bodywork (&amp; welding)

&gt;My advice would be to take a night class at your local voc.-tech. or 
&gt;community college.
&gt;It's really not a book-learning kind of thing.  To answer your question, 
&gt;though, here are
&gt;the books I have:
&gt;
&gt;Chilton Auto Body Repair--Chilton
&gt;
&gt;MIG Welding Handbook--L-TEC Welding Systems
&gt;The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook--The Esab Group, Inc.
&gt;Welder's Handbook--HP Books
&gt;
&gt;The last one gives a great overview.  Get ahold of it first.  Then, find a 
&gt;class.

I'll second the whole post. I have several of the books and I have taken a 
welding class at the university where I work and attend classes towards an 
engineering degree. WELL WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY.

A vocational school might teach a more in depth class than a University 
where they are training students to be engineers and managers.

As a result I can TIG/MIG/Heli-Arc/Stick Weld/weld with an oxy-acetylene 
torch. I also got the opportunity to use a plasma cutter too. For my class 
project I built an engine stand that has held several VW engines and 
presently holds my Corvair engine.

Well worth the $50 in materials. Yes you can buy one cheaper but they are 
typically too short for me - - I like to work at elbow height - not 
slightly stooped over.

In short I have some practical experience and with some more practice 
(recent practice) I could feel comfortable welding on a little bit of 
everything. I plan to take the advanced welding class in a few semesters 
when I have time.
