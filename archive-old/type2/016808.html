&gt;how can I get one shipped from
&gt;the good ole US of A and how
&gt;much would it cost?

Mike:

I just took a look at Kymco's web site, and from the looks of the order
form, it does appear that they anticipate doing business with customers
outside of North America - the pull-down menu for method of shipment
includes &quot;overseas freight&quot;.

They don't ask for credit card info on the order form, so you're at no
risk if you just go ahead and place an order and see what happens.
