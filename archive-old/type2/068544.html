Subject: Re: Type of grease for door hinges?

&gt;It ocurred to me that my sagging doors might have been saved had
&gt;they been properly lubricated.  
&gt;
&gt;What type of grease should be used on door hinges?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

 More to the point, how you going to get it in there?

 I use the stuff they call &quot;dripless oil&quot;.

 You can make your own by the way. Even better.

 Take some regular bearing grease, (not the white stuff) and thin
 it out with some fast evaporating solvent.

 Paint thinner, lacquer thinner, gasoline, your choice.

 You squirt it in and the solvent evaporates leaving you with nice
 greasy mess running down the door.

 Some will get in there tho.  :-)
