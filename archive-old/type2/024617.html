OK, after putting the engine back into my 80 Westy, I forgot to hookup 1 wire to the solenoid post before starting.  It turned temporarily and then went dead.  Did I fry my starter?  I get little to no spark across the solenoid posts and I'm too pissed to think rationally.  Anyone want my tickets to Beale St. Music Fest tonight and tomorrow?

Thanks,
Craig
