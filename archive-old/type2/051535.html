Subject: [T2] Main Seal Replacement

Good Day,

I recently rebuilt my engine and replaced the main seal between the engine
and transmission.  Things were great for about 2 weeks with only small drips
of oil.  However, after sitting for about a month I started the bus and
backed it into my driveway so the city snow plows could get by.  I noticed a
few days later that I had a huge oil slick running down my driveway.  My bus
was parked facing downhill at about a 10-15 degree incline.  Since then it
leaks a quart of oil every 50 miles or so.  Now for the fourth time in the
last couple of months I need to remove my engine.  I would love to make this
the last time for a while.  Please I beg of anybody to give me suggestions,
old wives tales, hints, prayers, or voodoo rituals to perform in order to
seal this damn thing up.  It is an automatic and I plan on replacing the
O-ring in the flex plate also.  Are there any sealers that you would
recommend?  Last time I used some brown Type III Aviation sealer in a white
plastic bottle that had a brush in the cap.  Others swore by it, but it
apparently didn't help me much.  What about hints?  I apparently had it
right for a little while, but what could I have screwed up to make it leak
later on?  I was gentle with the previous seal and though it was installed
right.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
