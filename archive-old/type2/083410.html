Subject: Re:[T2] where to buy a new engine?

--=====================_889472414==_

I purchased a Virtually New 1600DP LongBlock, from a company that advertises outta HotVw, called BAP imports. 
they sent the engine for 90$ on Roadway Trucking in a crate that i had to put a 150$deposit on. 
i put my core in the crate and sent it back to them.
when it was over and done with, i ended up payin 900$ for a nice engine w/a yr warranty. this was about four months ago, but just now i checked their site and i see they've already gone up in price. which seems to be the trend.
anyways..the longblock comes with a new Case, new stock heads, new pistons,new bearing,ect.ect.ect. 
Personally, i feel like i got a GR8T DEAL!!
if u know of different about this company please pass along any knowledge u have of them.
but i've redone my topend, bolted the engine back in....and i've just rolled over 400miles, breakin her in up in the Eastern Oregon Mtns. and i've yet to have any complaints. gettin her ready to roll to the midwest. 
check them out;

Hope this helps. and i would definately say, keep your Bussie. if u invest in her now, u'll know what kynd of love has been put into her. instead of buying another questionable ride. *shine on* -chris 

much love out to all u volksie gurus that keep helpin us newbies out and inspiring us to stay the path;)livinglight
