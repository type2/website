Subject: Re: [T2] bay window market crash?

David,

The problem that I have found is that everyone is too far away for
me to come and take their buses....looks like you may be in Maryland
and I am in Arkansas.

Phooey....would love the 78

The folks selling their bus have the same sort of problem...they were in 
Montana...although I guess that might be good for the NW part of the 
country...or maybe even California.



Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; found mine on eBay for a buy it now of 3100.. i took it.. paid
&amp;gt; another 1300 to have it shipped from Oregon to Maryland and i love it.
