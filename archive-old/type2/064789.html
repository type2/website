&gt;&gt; I took it to my local very friendly mechanic who hooked it up to his
&gt;&gt; machine which read the exhaust CO levels.  Here is his technique:
&gt;&gt; Let out a puff of propane into the area of suspected vacuum leak.
&gt;&gt; Watch the CO meter, if it jumps, the leak is in the area of the puff.

NOT!  That sounds kind of dangerous.

&gt;To answer your question yes there is a way to test for vacuum leaks.
&gt;Take a can of WD-40 or better yet Carb Cleaner, and spray it onto
&gt;sections were the suspected vacuum leak is...
&gt;If there is a vacuum leak the idle will go up and you've found your leak...

This is the preferred method.  It's worked for me, and while the carb
cleaner is flammable, it can be directed much more accurately than &quot;a puff
of propane&quot;, and it's not as explosive.
