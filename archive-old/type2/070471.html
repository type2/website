Subject: Dispatch from Fairbanks:  Head Torque is OK, Adjusting Screws Aren't

After my last posting, I got several helpful emails, possibly
the best of which was an offer from Tom Johnson here in
Fairbanks of an equipped garage in which to work.  BTW, we're
talking about a 1980 Westy.

I went ahead and torqued the cylinder head on the
&quot;low-compression&quot; side (my dry readings are 110, 111, 115, 125;
wet maybe 120, 120, 125, 133; midnight sun's are ~10%
higher--they may have used a battery booster).  If anything,
only one bolt was slightly less than 22 ft-lbs, so I don't think
that was my problem.  And boy it's a pain in the butt to get
that sheet metal off to get to the upper head bolts.

However, to torque the head bolts, I had to remove the
rocker-arms  and their supports, and noticed that the ends of
the adjusting screws were somewhat pitted.  When I got to the
front (#1) adjusting screws, I found that one of them is so
chewed up that it wouldn't be possible to adjust it.  Here's a
lame little picture:

                      |            |
                      |            |
                      |  adjuster  |
                      |            |
                      +---------+  |
      chewed section --&gt;        |  |
                                +--+
                  +------------+
                  | valve stem |
                  |            |
                  |            |
                  |            |

There's actually no space between the adjuster and the stem, I
just drew it exploded.  The top of the stems look pretty flat,
but the adjusting screws are all at least pitted on that side.

Does anyone know what would cause this?  I don't see what would
ever lubricate the contact between the adjuster and the valve
stem, but all my old solid-lifter engines never had this
problem.

I'm going to install new adjusting screws and adjust it
according to either Bentley or Mark Stephens (after I call
them), and I'll check out the other side.  (Assuming I can find
adjusting screws here in Fairbanks.)

Wish me luck!
Dennis
