Subject: Curtains for 1973 camper?

Hey everyone, I tried to wash the curtains in my new 73 camper tonight and
they completely shredded. They were looking pretty bad already so, I guess
its time to find some new(er) ones.

Do any of you have some you'd be willing to part with for a price... or can
you recommend someone that sells them? They dont have to be pretty... just
functional and clean.

Thanks!
