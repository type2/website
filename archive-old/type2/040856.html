It is the cop's duty to uphold the law.

If no law was broken, I'da been all over that cop with threats of lawsuits.

Also, to the person who got pulled over for *not* having a dead-head
sticker, you shoulda got that cop's badge number as well.

Sorry for the hostility, but we can't just let the bullies among the law
enforcement agencies use their badge to do whatever the hell they want.

Boy, I'm glad it Friday.

Peace -

&gt; It was an off duty cop and he ordered me out of the car. He then told
&gt; the girls to take
&gt; off. I asked him what the problem was, and he said that I might be okay,
and
&gt; the next
&gt; ten hitchers might be okay too, but what about the one that isn't? He said
he
&gt; didn't
&gt; want them getting into the habit of helping strangers.
&gt;                       He didn't offer a rideto the gas station either...
