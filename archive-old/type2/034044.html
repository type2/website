I'd put a jumper wire across that circuit's fuse to bypass the fuse and see if
the cold has affected the fuse and it's fit.

If the problem goes away then your problem is probably there.

I'm not up on VWs as much as everybody else here but my guess without checking
would be that the headlights and wipers are on separate fuses.

&gt; warmed up, so far, the headlights come on and the wipers work. This strikes
&gt; me as odd. Is there any poss cause that I should check first? I dont want to

&gt; weather is getting rough!
