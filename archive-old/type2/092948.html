&gt;&gt;Beware of the alfa1750 guy - he sells a lot of Weber and Dellorto carbs 
&gt;&gt;but they are just bare carbs (no manifolds, linkage, etc.).  I think he 
&gt;&gt;must get them off of wrecked cars in Europe.  No way to know if they will 
&gt;&gt;fit properly, not to mention how they are jetted.  Not saying he's 
&gt;&gt;defrauding anyone, just make sure you know what you are buying.

&gt;But that is all you could use anyhow on a VW - the linkage and manifolds 
&gt;are OEM specific.

I didn't mean to imply that he could use non-VW manifolds and linkage, only 
that he shouldn't expect to receive everything he needs to run the carbs 
from that guy's auction.  I would look for someone selling a complete set 
from a type-4 application so he will have all of the parts he needs.
