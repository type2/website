    I got my sink unit out of a long abandoned bus and the rubber washer, O 
ring, diaphragm, whatsit inside the pump was shot. Dan's suggestion about 
lubricating with vegetable shortening might have prevented this. The pump is 
still available at RV type places, but they didn't have any parts. I went to 
a plumbing supply, not orange box, you need to find the place where plumbers 
shop. There will be an ash tray and coffee maker on the counter. The counter 
man was not optimistic, but after looking through a few of the thousands of 
jars he found a white silicon piece that works fine. The only problem with it 
is, it won't stay primed. The marble is still there, perhaps not seating as 
it should.  I have to suck on the pipe after it has been sitting a few days. 
Yeah it's embarrassing but ...no wires. 
Don't forget to bleach the tank; I saw the inside of mine.
