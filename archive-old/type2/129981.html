&gt;Hi all - Does anyone know where I can find an extension for the shifter on my '71 Bus?  Thanks very much.

The one I've got on my '75 came from a wrecked Bus in a junkyard, but I think
Bus Boys has them .. I nosed at Bus Depot and couldn't find a listing, but that
doesn't mean they don't have them also.

FWIW
