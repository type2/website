&gt;Does anyone know where I can find a battery terminal like this. It's the

AMP is HUGE in the terminal business. All of the FI interfaces are made by 
them, and every type of computer interface. I have searched for years all 
the industrial suppliers with hundreds of pages of AMP terminals, and what 
I have concluded is no one carries the 12v automotive interfaces or 
terminals, at least not the ones used on the German cars. The type of 
battery terminal you have there I have watched for and never seen. But they 
are the pits as soon as corrosion gets started. Impossible to clean all the 
nooks and crannies, so the corrosion comes right back the first misty 
evening. And lots get over torqued and break. Unless your doing a true 
resto for an original, I would use a better terminal, and if you don't have 
the spendy clamps it takes to swage them properly, buy replacement cables 
with terminals installed and keep them clean along with the battery case. 
Your alternator and starter motor will love you for it and last much 
longer, not to mention the battery and cables. You never know, but a call 
to the VW dealer might show some original cables complete somewhere.
