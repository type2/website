Subject: Re: [T2] hole in tin?

I took a look at mine. I have the same hole but it looks more to be a slot
cut into the edge of the tin. You are right it is not the t-stat cable hole.
There is nothing in the hole in my tin either. I dont see it on the tin
diagram in the Bently. This same tin was used on the carburated engines
also, so Im thinking that maybe it could have been a cut out to fit around
something on these earlier engines.

Subject: [T2] hole in tin?


&gt; Hi, I am trying to figure out all the holes in the tin and what should be
in
&gt; them... so, 78 westy, right below the breather on the passenger side.  It
is
&gt; right next to the case in the corner about 1/2&quot; long and 3/8&quot; wide with
&gt; rounded corners.  It goes through the tin that covers the top of the
engine on
&gt; the passenger side  It is not the thermostat cable hole, I think.  What I
&gt; believe is the thermostat cable hole is smaller and to the outside.  .
&gt;
&gt; thanks
