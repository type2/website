Subject: Re: [T2] Heater questions (replacement of ducting)

I used 4&quot; flexible metal drier hose. I wrapped it with reflective fiberglass insulation, then put several heavy coats of rubberized undercoating all the way down the pipe. I used roof patching material on the &quot;Y&quot; section of the duct. I haven't had a chance to test it out yet, but that's my 2 cents.                      -Paul Deatherage

stuff I need anymore. My question is what have folks used as non-stock 
replacements for heater ducting? I was thinking of using either PVC pipe or 
aluminum pipe instead of paper tubing for the main pipe that goes from the 
rear to the front of the bus (I think it's about 3&quot; wide by 5-6 feet long). 
What types of materials will hold up to the heat? Will PVC pipe melt, or 
give off fumes that will kill me? I heard somebody mention the black 
corrugated plastic pipe, does that work, does it slow down the air allot? I 
am going to do all the insulation and stuff too, but I got to get the heat 
in before I can worry about it going out!
