Subject: Re: Fuel Injection, looking for book

There's a Bosch-specific book which covers the gamut of Bosch fuel
injection.  I can't remember the name, but it's fairly obvious, like
&quot;Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; or something like that.
(I've read it at my local library, aka &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble&quot;.&lt;grin&gt;)

I've also found that the manual I have for my '81 Vanagon - Clymer's
manual for '80-'83 Vanagon - is _very_ good in it's coverage of the
fuel injection.

The trouble with fuel injection is that there are a _lot_ of things
to check, including some things you can't check, like the &quot;brain&quot; 
(ECU).  But each of the things you need to check is fairly simple in
and of itself (e.g., check temp sensor hot and cold, check aux air
regulator hot and cold, etc.) using a multi-meter.

I'm guessing that your fuel injection is essentially the same as mine,
so if you have any specific questions, fire away.
