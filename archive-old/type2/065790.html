&gt;Environmental degradation??  What kind of environmental degradation do
&gt;you think manufacturing a NEW car for everyone every three years produces?
&gt;How much more ore needs to be refined (or old metal re-smeltered), plastics
&gt;produced, and power/electricity generated, to manufacture and assemble a
&gt;NEW car.  How much pollution is generated by all of this?

You are right.  It is surely significant.

&gt;Personally, I think
&gt;that keeping an old car on the road instead of buying a new one more than
&gt;makes up for slightly more fuel consumption, and slightly more exhaust
&gt;emissions.

SLIGHTLY more emissions?  You have obviously not compared the emissions of
a nineties car with one from the late sixties or early seventies.  My '73
bus emits more pollution in five minutes than my '87 Mustang does (even
with 2-1/2 times the displacement) in an hour, and I have the smog
printouts to prove it.  I feel bad about it, but not bad enough to stop
driving my bus.  :)
