Subject: Re: [T2] Wanting a good foam - and NOT from a beer for a
  change!

I bought a 2&quot; thick memory foam matress topper from http://www.overstock_dot_com/ and thought it was a good deal, I can't remember what I paid now, I put it on top of the foam in my pop-top.

I think I will redo my back seat and lower bed in memory foam when I get around to it.

JM




&gt; &gt; I am looking for a decent grade foam to redo the 
&gt; &gt; upholstery in my Riv. JoAnn wants $90 for a 4x24x76 
&gt; &gt; and most foam places in Denver want WELL over $130.
