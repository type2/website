Subject: Choice of Power Inverters?

Hi List!

Since there was just another thread about Optimax
batteries, and running two batteries, I wanted to ask
a &quot;related&quot; question about power inverters.. I didn't
find much (recent) information in the T2 archives..

I just got a new (to me) laptop and want to use it in
my bus, if I can find an open WiFi point I can look up
stuff on the net for free while out and about!!Anyway,
power is the issue here, the laptop only runs about
2hrs max..

What inverters are proven in use by Type2 list
members? What can be run off them, do you have one or
two batteries in your bus (what type) and where did
people buy their inverters, and what did they cost?

I'm thinking I'd like to get a bigger wattage unit so
I could run a laptop, printer, and make cups of tea
while I'm out.. A cool mobile office setup! Not so
crazy if you know that my job is outside sales for
auto aftermarket, so I spend most days out visiting
car dealers and bodyshops.. I have been using my
girlfriend's Corolla, but (given my recent parking
battle with the neighbours) I'm seriously thinking
about getting my bus painted nicely, upgrading the
heating system so it recirculates and is insulated,
and then using it every day for work!!

An impossible dream? I don't think so.. I've owned
this one since 1991 (it's my 4th bus) and as others
have said, I'm not about to give up my long term
commitment now!!
 
TIA,
Dave Burton
