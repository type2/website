Searched the archives this morning; then headed down to WallyWorld to see
what kind of paint they had for my wife's yard swing. I had eyed the
Rustoleum the other day and thought &quot;Hey, why wouldn't this stuff work on my
bus if I could get the right color?&quot;

I'm not into form; it's function I'm looking for. In fact, I'm of the
opinion that a bus that looks less appealing is less likely to get ripped
off. I'm happy to have a few flaws in mine. But rust is another story. I'm
looking to get rid of that...and while I'm at it, why not match the paint
instead of going for that colorblind urban camouflage look?

Anyway, to make a long story short, I ended up at a Sherwin Williams home
paint store and let the guy there let me talk myself into ordering a gallon
of oil based enamel that he's going to color match for me. I left the heater
vent channel for him to use.

...................._dot_can you put a 'hold' on that order?

I figure I'll buff out the good paint on the
bus and then spot-paint as I fix the rust. If I get the time, I'll do the
whole thing someday down the line.

For those of you who know paint...unlike me...what kind of trouble am I
asking for with this shortcut?

.....................Hello Joe...If you can still put a &quot;hold&quot; on that 
GALLON of Sherwin Williams special order paint, maybe you should do it and 
run some small-area tests first, to be sure it is compatible with the 
Rustoleum.


..................I have tried using Rustoleum brown rust-inhibitor primer 
on my bus, and when I went to paint over it with automotive primer, I got 
serious crinkling/incompatibility that had to be allowed to dry and then 
had to be sanded off. The fish oil in the Rustoleum didn't work well with 
the automotive primer solvents, I guess.  So I say, run some preliminary 
tests in places that aren't critical. Be sure to let the Rustoleum cure for 
a few days, before trying your Sherwin Williams color coat product. Try a 
few ounces before you buy a gallon, and do some  trials.

.....................If I were doing it, I'd try not to mix 
systems.......I'd stay with the Rustoleum system, and use a color coat from 
the stock Rustoleum collection. Or, use a Sherwin Williams metal primer and 
the Sherwin Williams color coat. I'd probably pick battleship grey.  Saw a 
bus done in that once and liked it.


..................In the Rustoleum system, I think you could color coat a 
bus with about a dozen spray cans of Rustoleum, maybe 50 bucks worth, if 
you bought the commercial size cans rather than those little  ones that 
most hardware stores carry. The commercial units look about twice as big. 
The Por-15 has been good for me, over bare metal and even on bare metal 
with small rust pits. But whatever you do, run small trials first.

.....................Doyt Echelberger

Keep in mind, I'm not interested in winning
shows or attracting crooks. I mainly want to stop the rust and come out a
little better than someone with a roller or a brush and a bucket of home
latex paint. I figure I'll grind/cut/sand the rust out; then I'll use
POR-15; then I'll use the Rustoleum Brown Rust-Inhibitor Primer; then I'll
spray on this Oil-based Enamel paint.

BTW, I've got a compressor and spraygun and I actually painted a bus once,
using $100 a gallon paint, though I'm not sure if it was the oil-based or
acrylic enamel. It was a Dupont brand, I recall. I got some orangepeel, but
it was a much better looking bus when I was done than it was when I started.

Oh, the Sherwin Williams stuff--$26 for a gallon; about $11 for a quart. My
bus is a blue '72. I'll try to get the formula if anyone wants it.

Thanks! Joe
