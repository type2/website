&gt;Drove me crazy, for a week. The only way to acheive  a firm pedal was to 
&gt;use a one man bleeding system with a vacuum pump. I found that pumping
&gt;28&quot; of vacuum and waiting until all the tiny bubbles dissappeared, closed
&gt;the bleeder and went to the next wheel. Start at the furthest wheel from the
 
&gt;master cylinder and work toward the closest wheel. This solved the problem.
&gt;Hope this helps

Seems I just saw one of these deluxe vacuum units in the auto dept. at Wal Mart
for about $15.95. They're worth every penny.
