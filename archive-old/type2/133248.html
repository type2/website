&gt; &gt; First thing to do is line this event all up with Chris in Tenn.

&gt; If you guys are serious about this, I also have my 2 car garage w/a
&gt; nice/big compressor. I'm about 2 hours west of Chris on I-40. and a
&gt; big enough house to accomodite a good amount of people on the floor.
&gt; (since the busses will, be well...err...wet :)

well that would be the difference between a one day and a two day drive,
would still come but it would make it more expensive since I would have to
get a room, my bus isn't a westy and it would be full of tools etc...
