Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Brake Backing Plate Removal

&gt; Easy. Just below the 2 lower bolts you removed from the backside on the bottom is a dowel pin.
&gt; Get an old 6&quot; long 10mm bolt or a large pin punch and drive the dowel pin out from the back side.
&gt; The backing plate will pop right off.
&gt; 

Karl,

Thanks for this info.
 
On the exploded Bentley diagram of the rear axel, the dowel pin on the
bearing housing is shown as attached to the bearing housing. Thus at
least on my 71 SC it cannot be pounded out from the engine side of the
backing plate. The pin stays attached to the bearing housing.

I got the backing plate off by working a long beefy screw driver
between the backing plate and the bearing housing at various locations
around the stuck pin/backing plate. I used more force than I wanted
to, but got it off finally. The old backing plate ended up a little
bent around the hole below the two bolts, but since I replaced it with
a new backing plate, no big loss. Now the little clip springs on the
new backing plate click when I turn the adjuster stars, just like this
old truck did 34 years ago when it was brand new.
