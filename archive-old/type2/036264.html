Subject: RE: Accordian Heater Tube

The vanagon gasket fits just fine,

from 80-83.5 vanagons they had the same style heater accordion tubes but
with a silicone gasket instead of an asbestos one.

Probably still available from VW.

&gt; Originally there would have been an asbestos 'collar' wrapped round the
&gt; inside of the tube, about 1&quot; wide and 1/8&quot; thick.  Then inside that, next to
&gt; the metal tube, is a thin metal sleeve.  I bought new tubes a couple of
&gt; years ago and the asbestos is now some sort of high temp plastic (I assume
&gt; it's high temp, might have melted all over for all I know).  The piece of
&gt; asbestos you found in there will be the remains of one of the collars, they
&gt; are quite crumbly.  You could have a go at making something to pad out the
&gt; tube at the join.  AFAIK it is not possible to buy the gaskets on their own.
&gt; It does seem a waste to throw away the whole tube, there is probably nothing
&gt; else wrong with it.

&gt; &gt; goes to front of bus is much to large for metal tube. Is 
&gt; &gt; there a gasket that 
&gt; &gt; goes around metal tube . Should I make a gasket. Bentley
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; looking at it , did they put any asbestos in these vehicles , 
&gt; &gt; there is a 
&gt; &gt; white crumbly piece like gasket  in accordian tube.
