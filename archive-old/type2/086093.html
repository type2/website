   You come an get it. Lake Havasu AZ. This is a straight 69/70 westy, nice
interior, cushions all there and recovered. No ice box but the rest of the
camper stuff is there. No shifter or taillights, but it does roll. If you
have a rusty bus and need parts, this is the deal. Many good usable parts.
No trans or engine. This bus WILL be cut up next week if not commited to.
Also has new drag link, whoyaaa. It would be worth to come get it just for
the free Westy interior!!!! no title but can give notorized bill of sale

ronnie  cleaning up the yard!

ps. There is also a 73 westy for sale in Havasu. New paint and top canvas.
Looks beautiful. no engine!! Owner has spent 1000's in the last year on
paint and the top but now needs it GONE  1000 dollars or best offer. Needs
gona ASAP. It is stored in a lot by my shop
