&gt; I know from my own experiences that to avoid rust you have to avoid
&gt; trapping water.  Don't let it in and when it gets in, DO let it drain. I
&gt; want insulation that I can be sure will not collapse into the bottom of
&gt; the cavity and collect moisture.  The cheap ceiling tiles are made of a
&gt; stiffened fiberglass with a cheap vinyl sheet glued to the face.  Peal off
&gt; that sheet and you have a stiff insulation panel you can glue in place.
&gt; I may conduct a test or two to be sure that whatever the stiffening
&gt; substance is that it does not wash out.

what about something like Nate used. the bubble/insulation?

I'm going to give it a shot.
