&gt; I know I already asked this, but noone answered. And since it was right
&gt; before July 4th I figured I'd try one more time. Sorry if you already read
&gt; this, but I really need to know. I'm going broke.
&gt; I had a spring in my air intake sensor box adjusted in CA. It was supposed
&gt; to make my bus use more gas, but make it run cooler. It was to help get over
&gt; the Rockies. Well, my gas mileage sucks. I need to adjust the spring back.
&gt; It isn't worth it. I get like 14 mpg.

This had me thinking: since only some busses came with the switch to do the
altitude adjustment, has anyone wired an apporpriate switch up from in the
cab to the same pins of the ECU to get a little more power on hill climbs
especially at altitude?
