Subject: Re: [T2] speculate with me

Hi Joe,

I have a 79 bus with a 3-rib transmission in it.   The transmission  
is about 5/8&quot; too short to match up properly with the later bus   
shift linkage. In order to make it fit the PO of your bus probably  
swapped the nosecone of the 091 over to the 002. They would also have  
to swap over a 215mm or 210mm flywheel to match the 002 bell-housing  
and starter.

But.... They might have swapped the 091 bell-housing over at the same  
time they swapped in the nosecone. If there's a part number on your  
starter it will help identify which bell-housing and starter combo  
you have.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; STARTER,presumably a PO had replaced the 091 with the 3 rib. now, this
&gt; transmission is messed up badly, so i bought another 6 rib 091.
&gt; please elaborate on these points for me. im hoping i can use my  
&gt; same starter
&gt; since i am broke from buying parts
