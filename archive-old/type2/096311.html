&gt; I have a reoccurring problem with a 79 bus, engine stock with FI.  
&gt; Occasionally it is hard to start, and after coaxing it to start, it will only 
&gt; give me 6 to 8 seconds of power, then the bus coasts for 7 to 8 seconds. If 
&gt; my foot remains on the accelerator while coasting, then the bus will 
&gt; typically lurch back into power for another 7 to 8 sec.  This cycle will 
&gt; repeat itself for miles.  It hasn't done this for my mechanic, so he's not 
&gt; all that sure what I'm describing.  I checked the alternator (ok), had the 
&gt; battery checked to make sure it was holding a charge, and had it tuned up, 
&gt; but it still does this.

sounds like the temp sender/ECU are &quot;hunting&quot; try putting a small resistor
in line with the temp sensor two,  trying to remember what  but I think
50ohms worked but no promises.

YMMV
