I think that super deep basket at the bottom looks like the tray I've seen 
in some Coleman Ice chests. Sits on a lip near the top of the chest to keep 
stuff out of the water/melted ice.  If it's not in the campmobile owner's 
manuals, I'd say it was added by a PO.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok In my bus (and in the picture on the link I attached) there is a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;slotat the bottom of the fridge for something to slide in to. On the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;superoriginal 72 in my link there IS a big tray there as if a vegetable 
&gt;&gt;&gt;crisperor something. http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg If this tray is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;original what are the slots for? A rack? It sure looks original. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;My ice box came from a 73 and it has several slots too, but it only has 
&gt;thewire basket and the ice tray with the drain hose.  I figured 
&gt;the&gt;mulitpleslots allow you some adjustments.
