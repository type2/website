Subject: RE: [T2] replacing sink pump

&gt; So replacing the sink pump in our 76 westy is a bit bigger project that we
&gt; thought. It looks like we will need to remove the whole cabinet
&gt; there to be able to connect all of the wires and put the pump back in.


This should be a ten minute job.  Just cut and splice into the existing
wires going to your old pump.
