Congratulations!  I *do* know how you feel.


&gt;1.  I decided to attempt to pull the engine w/o touching the transmission.

I pulled the (78 2L) engine only and can concur that there was a good bit o'
frustration.  I needed to get a bunch of stuff off there anyway, for
cleanup, hence my decision.


&gt;2.  Save yourself the frustration and possible injury:  get someone to help
&gt;you.  I know some of you guys do it by yourself all time, but you must admit
&gt;that this engine is HEAVY.  Definitively not like the 1600 bug engines I
&gt;remember from my youth.

I have no doubt that some ops would have been easier with a helper.  But
engine alone was done all by my lonesome, with a fair floor jack and a
bottle jack.  It was not &quot;fun&quot; but wasn't a backbreaking piece of work.  Got
mine onto a piece of old plywood and dragged the plywood into the shop.
Didn't even attempt to lift the engine till the heads and lotsa other stuff
was off.


&gt;3.  This operation will take time.

Oh yes...  for me it was about 6 hrs over a two-day period.  I'm sure
practice will make perfect, tho am not sure that I want to be perfect at this...


&gt;4.  Forget Bentley, the procedure is not complete.  Don't have a Hayes,
&gt;maybe it's better.

Bentley is great for clear photos and some info.  I had both Muir and
Bentley open on the floor of the bus, pretty much followed Muir.

Keep orange hand cleaner jug handy so that hands can be roughly cleaned
before attempting to turn pages.
