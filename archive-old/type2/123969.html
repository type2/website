Subject: A TOUGH question to answer concisely. 

And no, the question isn't &quot;Are you sure Chris knows how to spell
CONCISELY?&quot;! :)  Lol
 
Ok, the reason I thought my fuel sender had a loose wire was becouse
I've seen it. The PO cut out a big square hole above the sender, and the
ground wire had a screw through it, but not screwed into anything. 
 
Well, I just went out and screwed it in, and NADA. I checked the
Archives and found a few questions about testing stuff, but no answers.
:(  I'm pretty sure I've seen the technique for testing both the gauge
and the sender somewhere before but I can't remember where. Probably on
the list, but I don't see it.  The archives mention something about
Grounding a wire on the Gauge, and the gauge should peg to full if it's
good. And the sender should have certain resistances while the float
goe's up and down. 
 
1: What wire do I ground out on the gauge to get it to Peg to Full? 
2: Does the fuel sender just unscrew? 
3: What are the resistances I should have at my fuel sender for the
range. I.e. 100ohms at empty and 5,000 at full or whatnot. 
 
And yes, I'm VERY evil and don't have the Bently book yet. Or even the
::god forbid:: Haynes book. I've prioritized it right behind things like
Distributor and Tail Lights. :) 
 
Cheers
