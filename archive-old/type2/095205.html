Richard,
	Since these 'flakes' are more than likely rust from the lines, and shrapnel 
from the rubber parts in the hydraulic system, I suppose you 'should' remove 
and clean the reservoir.  BUT- Unless you rebuild everything that contains 
that rubber,  and replace your lines, it will be in the same condition as it 
will be if you leave things alone.  It is already in MUCH better shape since 
you bled the old fluid out.  I guess it's up to you, but I wouldn't do 
anything unless I planned on doing it all.

My fiftieth of a dollar.
