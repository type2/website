Subject: Re: [T2] starter, won't start unless push back in 3rd gear

&gt;Reading in the Muir Idiot book it suggested that I put it in 3rd gear and 
&gt;push back on it and that magically started my bus. Then it was fine but 
&gt;now everytime I have to do that and wait a couple of minutes to get it to 
&gt;start.

The starter gear is sticking in the flywheel teeth.  You shouldn't have to 
wait, just
bouncing the bus backwards against third gear will allow the teeth to unbind.
You may need to clean the gear teeth (engine out), replace the (spring in 
the) starter,
or tighten the nuts that hold the starter to the tranny.

&gt;The Muir talks about making sure some bolts on the starter are tight.
&gt;
&gt;Which bolts is he talking about, can someone please describe them to me 
&gt;and tell me what size they are.

The two that hold the starter to the bell housing of the tranny.  Actually, 
the bottom one is a stud mounted
to the tranny, and the upper one is the &quot;D&quot; headed bolt that is the upper 
right engine to tranny bolt.

You need to read the instructions in Muir, then read and look at the 
pictures in The Bentley Manual.
This is what Muir himself says in the &quot;Idiot Book.&quot;  The Muir IS NOT a 
replacement for the Bentley, nor
was it ever intended to be.  It is folksy explanations for the newbie 
driver/mechanic.
