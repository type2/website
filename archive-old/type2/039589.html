Subject: Heater Cable Availability

Mornin'
    I'm having trouble with the archives exceeding the time limit. Does 
anyone know who carries heater cables for a '73. I've checked BusDepot &amp; 
RMMW's web sites.
                                                            TIA, Rob
P.S. Hello to all of you who made MerleFest, and thanks again for the rocker 
cover gasket!
