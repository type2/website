Subject: Help with Options survey

Hey everyone.  Im developing a Classifieds/Auto Sales app here at work and
figured I'd apply the Beta to VW's..  (and why not?!!)  This app is gonna
work alot differently than anything you've seen so far on the other
classified sections on sites so i need some advice.  The biggest thing is
options for vehicles.

When placing a listing for a vehicle the listee will choose from a set list
of options as well as having a write in box.  Everyone start naming off all
the options i should include relating to VW's (ie sunroof/ragtop, popouts,
engine sizes, and so on)  After 2 weeks of coding I'm almost ready to
release this thing but my head cant hold anymore info so i need all the help
i can get so i dont overlook anything.

Also, since this wont be a commercial effort for the VW beta, i have all
kinds of advertisement sections available for FREE!!! to any of you with
business' relating to repair, part sales, insurance, VW dealersship or
resellers.  Also, i do have a banner space for vw hobbyist sites too.  2
sizes for the banner 145x87 if anyone wants to submit one. and the usual
468x60.
