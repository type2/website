Since this is Friday, I hope it's appropriate to post this message.

My son recently bought an '81 Westy.  Since then, I have visited VW web
sites and read messages on this list.  I have noticed that owners of buses
and campers seem to like to get together for camping trips.  Although I
would not participate (I don't own a VW, but being a product of the 60's I
did own a 65 and a 68 beetle, as well as a 70 Karmann Ghia), I would like to
suggest a possible camping trip.

The New River Gorge area of Southern West Virginia is an easy drive from
several metropolitan areas in the mid-Atlantic states.  Washington, D.C. is
about a 6-hour drive.  Pittsburgh is about 4-hours (I think).  Richmond,
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Knoxville, and Louisville are also within easy
driving distance.
The New River offers some of the best white water rafting east of the
Mississippi.  In October, when the water is released from the Summersville
Dam, the Gauley River truly presents a challenging white water experience.
In July (I believe), there is an outdoor oldies concert nearby, where 50's
and 60's cars are displayed.   Mostly locals attend, so you can get a taste
for the culture (no, they're not like those people in Deliverance).

Best of all, in October, about 350 people from all over parachute from the
New River Gorge Bridge.  The foliage is in full color and one side of the
highway is closed for craftsmen, etc. to display their wares.  Quite
varied groups show up to make pitches, including locals, Army recruiters,
fundamentalists preachers, etc.

This area is gaining in popularity, but is not yet so commercialized.
Access is good from four lane highways in all directions.  Guess I'm
prejudiced since I grew up in the area.   Since I still have relatives in
the area, I can try to find more information if there is an interest.
