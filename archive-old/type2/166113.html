Subject: Re: Using a progressive carb

Perhaps Too offtopic for the list-but relates to our once used 71 bus..
When we lived in COLD Syracuse I replaced a touchy 34PICT3 with  a Pinto 
2 throat carb on my 71 bus, and the reason I had no warmth problems is I 
used the stock manifold with the preheat pipe and an adaptor to the 
carb...- worked fine, had good &quot;get on the highway or when flooring it&quot; 
power with no overall change in milage.  There was very little space 
above this for an air cleaner, so I used a low toyota filter sitting on 
a plate mounted to carb surrounded by 6 eyebolts and springs that I 
hooked into an upper plate with its own eyebolts- had just enough room 
to slide in the filter with the above plate and hook the springs!  The 
choke was manual, with a cable up to the driver.

  Cold weather is of course the enemy of the weber progressive! I have
  adapted an air cleaner off a Mazda to get warm air in initially as it
  uses a wax capsule to open the cold/warm air flap so I didn't have to
  use vacuum to operate the flap as most air cleaners do. This arrangement
  helps cold running ......
