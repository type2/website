Item 1:
Anyone catch the Dilbert animated TV show?  Whenever Dilbert is
driving on the freeway there are a lot of buses in the background. 
They're the only identifiable vehicle in the show.  I wonder if there
are some closet bus fanatics working on that show?

Item 2:
Consumer Reports, noted for really twisted product testing (they
expect 4x4s to corner like Porsches, for example) finally got one
right.  In their minivan/SUV/truck buyers guide issue they have an
article on the origin of the minivan.  Prominent in the article is a
picture of a vintage VW bus and a definite statement that VW, not Lee
Whatshisname, invented the minivan.  Thankfully, they didn't actually
test a bus! :)

That's all from Sunny SoCal.  80 degrees outside today.  Don't move
here though, as we have nasty earthquakes!
