Subject: Re: [T2] 009 timing

The 009 is probably okay. The biggest difference is that the vacuum dist. 
is prob. a little smoother on take off. I ran a 009 on all of my VW's so 
far but on a bus I recommend a vacuum one.

The reason is that the mechanical version keeps the engine's timing fully 
advanced all the time at speeds over idle. This makes a little more power 
but can also cause your engine to run hot or ping on hills if you are 
aren't paying attention. This a big deal if you loan out your bus to 
friends who don't know any better. Pinging and over heating is a BIG deal 
too and will kill your engine in a short time.

What a vacuum advance dist. can do for you is back off the timing when the 
engine is under load (your foot is on the floor) because the engine won't 
produce much vacuum at those times and the springs inside the vacuum dist. 
will retard the timing. Helps keep the keep engine a little cooler, prevent 
pinging, and generally last a little longer. Power wise? It's a small 
difference - seat of your pants thing. A vacuum dist. may not make as much 
power on a hill but the engine lasts longer for it. Again, a seat of the 
pants thing.

The other difference is that the 009 may (in some cases) cause a little 
hesitation on take off. If you are a gentle driver you'll notice it more 
than if you are running around with your foot on the floor (aren't we all?).

Gas mileage difference? Yes - a little over barely something... &lt;grin&gt;

I used to think my '72 Super Beetle with the 40 HP engine in Italy would 
get better gas mileage but --- I used to think my dual quiet pack exhaust 
gave me more power too. How can you measure it though? It would be hard 
without a dyno. My Super Beetle hunches probably had something to do with 
the 100 octane leaded gas I was running (in 1992!) - made me think I was 
going faster on the hills. &quot;Look man! I climbed that hill in the 3rd gear - 
wa-hoo!&quot;

Conclusion? Run the 009 for a little more umph. Run the vacuum for 
smoothness and better thermal breathing room. Most of all run what you can 
afford. Just keep your engine tuned, and complete (each and every piece of 
tin and rubber) and you can't go wrong.

Also check out Muir's &quot;Idiot&quot; and Bentley manual. Muir's book taught me why 
everything that was put on these engines was important and what their 
purpose was. He also did a good job of breaking down the procedures into 
something a beginner understands (I am assuming you're a beginner). The 
Bentley has the more correct procedures and the technical specs and great 
pictures. Muir wasn't always right, but just double check repair procedures 
with us and Bentley - chances are we have done it before.

If it saves you one trip to the mechanic the books have probably paid for 
themselves. You are the only mechanic you can really trust - and then you 
have all of us too!!!

&gt;ok i'm the one with the 009 dist and i need some bigtime advice. This is what
&gt;happened. This 70 bus is my first vw. In fact it is the only vw i have ever
&gt;drove
&gt;or ridden in and i love it. So you can see how green i am. I bought this bus
&gt;two years ago and started driving it one year ago this month. I put in a
&gt;rebuilt
&gt;engine and replaced everything on the engine as the bus had been stored for
&gt;19 years and i assumed everything was bad. The engine had a rod knocking.
&gt;The shop where i bought everything told me that the 009 dist was the best way
&gt;to go. Probably didn't have a vac dist. I was very satisfied with what i have
&gt;until so many of you said the vac dist was better. I can't compair as i have
&gt;never driven another vw. I don't even know anyone with a vw. I still have the
&gt;vac adv dist. The bus had 71000 miles and i know that is right so the dist is
&gt;probably worth rebuilding only i don't know how. Mike said he would send
&gt;something on it and i would be greatful. So let me know if i'm missing some
&gt;thing by using this 009. sorry for the long list. I drive this bus every day.
