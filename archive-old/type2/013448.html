Subject: CV Joint Question
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 09:51:42 US/Mountain

OK, it's been a long time since I've had CV problems.  But I getting the dread 
click/clunking noise in my 73 Westy so I know its about time again.  The noise 
is MUCH more noticable when I'm turning right and accelerating.  Anyone know if 
this would tend to indicate a right-side or left-side CV going bad?

Thanks.
