Subject: trip report (sort of) / bus sighting  (long)

hi all,

it's close enough to friday right?

this is actually a trip i make daily (to + from work), but today it was
interesting.

got in the bus this morning and cranked her up. took a couple tries, but she
always takes a couple tries lately b/c it's chilly, more on that later...
cranked her up and the red light stayed on today. oh oh. turned it off,
tightened the alternator belt, cranked again, light goes out. ok good. get
to work just fine, as usual.

after work i crank her up and drive to the gas station across the parking
lot, fill up, then the bus won't start, after quite a few more tries than
usual. so i says to myself 'something must be wrong' and go look at the
engine. what do i find but a wet fuel hose. great! at least i didn't burn
the bus down. so i yank out the old one, getting a few nasty cuts in the
process, the outer part of it had a hole, but the inner part was still there
(but leaking),  and I replace it at the gas station (good thing i have all
those spares).  nobody from the gas station came out to complain, they know
me there.  then i got all over town to pick up the guys in my band and take
us to our show, then take them home, and me home, no problems. BTW, all my
band's equipment was in the bus this whole time. I'm so glad I avoided
disaster. Thanking my lucky stars in fact.

....(more on the hard starting):  the recent cold weather happened to
coincide with me installing a new stereo my family gave me for xmas.
altogether the deck and amplifiers draw about 40-45 amps (depending how
loud) at listening level. I have a 55A alternator, and apparently a slack
belt) so the (brand new) battery isn't exactly fully charged. come to think
of it, i had a dead battery the other day and had to charge it before i went
to work, made me an hour late. so now i seldom listen to the radio, and the
starter turns faster like it should.

other problems:  brake/tail lights!  got pulled the other day on the way
home for having no tail lights or brake lights whatsoever. cop told me to
drive home with the hazards on. so i futzed with them the next day, they
work, but then they don't. they work sometimes. I always check them now
while edna's warming up, and recheck them in the rearview mirror when i'm
stopped at lights (at night) and they're ittermittent, which is annoying.
I've futzed with them a few times now and i guess i'll have to break down
and buy replacement light assemblies, but oh well.

bus sighting: right after i had the ordeal at the gas station, i passed a
white over green '71 (?) loaf heading south on 751 near 54 in durham, NC.
anyone on the list?  he must not have heat either b/c he was wearing mittens
and a knit cap. i also saw the same bus at best buy in durham right before
christmas. NICE BUS.

i had no idea i could ramble so much, sorry for the wasted bandwidth.
