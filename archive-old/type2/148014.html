Subject: PLF VW 

Hi all,
       I have been a listmember and have owned my bus for the last 5 
years. While I rarely post I read each and every e-mail and use the 
archives regularly. I have heard all the nice things that have been 
said about Dawn _at_ PLF VW and the quality of her work when it comes to 
poptop canvas. I placed an order with her on May 30th 2005, for a 
custom color poptop canvas. When I placed the order (and my credit card 
was charged) I was told the order would take about 4 weeks. Well it's 
been 8 weeks and I have not gotten my canvas. I wrote a couple of 
e-mails to both Dawn and the contact at her website but have gotten no 
response. This is not intended to flame anyone but : Should I be 
worried about not getting my order? Has anyone else had the same 
experience with PLF? Does anyone know what could be the reason for no 
response from PLF?
Thanks
Kevin
