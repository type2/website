The background:

New generator and regulator in July
Red light hesitant to go out when starting up, but fine after a few minutes.

The problem:

Driving home late tonight, bus completely dies, lights go out, electrical
burning smell.
Everything comes back a few seconds later, seems fine except lights are ver
dim at idle, but brighten up when revving engine.
Generator light behaves normally, ie idiot light works the way it should.
All battery connections fine, etc.

The Solution:

Any ideas?  Anything I should check first thing in the AM?
