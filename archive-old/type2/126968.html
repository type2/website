Subject: [T2]72 brake pedal way tight?????

i have a friend that we got running last night but is haveing trouble with his brake pedal....
the bus has been sitting up at least 5 months cause the tag on it expired at least 5 months ago...~!~
 
ok hooked up brake booster hose and the idle dropped and the bus sounds awesome..
problem is that the brake pedal is so tight it seems that the brake booster isnt working..? no eratic idle though...
any suggestions what this is..we have gotten so close now and must get it fixed so he can go to everybus in four nights......
 
anything we can do.. i suggested we take off the brake booster hose both ends and cork one end and look for leaks...? havent done that yet.. 
thanks fo all help... spent al day and half the night till like 3 this mornign swaping engines and such ....
sure would be nice to overcome this obstacle 
peace
Cha
 
has hardly no give at top.... 
like a clutch is suppose to have i think 1 inch softness .. his brake pedal doesnt have any cushion.. could do a good one legged stand up on it..
