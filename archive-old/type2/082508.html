Don't worry, i did the same thing, before my bentley got here :)
&gt; 
&gt; 77 Westy, original engine: I was able to see my thermostat very
&gt; clearly because the lower cooling tin was missing on the right
&gt; side of the engine. Does the thermostat contract as it warms up,
&gt; pulling on the cable and opening the flaps? Or does it contract
&gt; as it cools, closing the flaps. I can't picture how the system

The t-stat starts out compressed &amp; expands when hot. (there is a nice
pic w/ dimentions in the bentley when it gets there)

 
&gt; BTW, thanks to all for your informative answers to my endless
&gt; questions! You folks are pretty quick to answer and no one has
&gt; gotten fed up and said &quot;RTFM!!&quot; It's on order....  ;^)

Oh, sorry. RTFM :)
