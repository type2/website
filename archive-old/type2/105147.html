Subject: [T2] Re: getting rid of joulise windows

&gt;&gt;WTF do you want to do that for?  Seriously...  Are you
trying to make your Westfalia look like a Westfakia?&lt;&lt;

Jim,

for me, it is just a matter of personal preference.

having had both types, i find the slider types more
to my liking.

also, the center side window seals (one-piece) are
only about 20 bucks, which will cost less &amp; get rid
of the &quot;vent window frame rot&quot; problem that you mentioned.
