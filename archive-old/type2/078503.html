Subject: Group 24 instead of starting batt?

Greetings list -

I hope all went well over the holidays.

The starting battery in Itch isn't holding a charge, and I'm going to 
replace it. Remember Itch? 1969 Westy. One battery total, so I'm using the 
same battery to start and run the lights/radio whilst camping.

I was thinking of putting a Group 24 (80 amp/hr deep cycle) battery in place 
of the current starting battery. Assuming the G24 has the cold-cranking amps 
(CCA) to turn the motor, what problems might I cause by doing this? Anybody 
doing this now?

Thanks -

Mike &amp; Itch
