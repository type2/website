HOW WE SPENT OUR SUMMER VACATION
By George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
Part 4 of 4, New Mexico, Arizona, California

Texico, NM
Hit New Mexico here.  I wonder how many stateline towns there are that
mix the names of the two states to create their own?

Clovis, NM
Portales, NM
Nice little towns.  Next time through we^Òll do some exploring in this
area.  In Clovis, we switched to US70.

Elida, NM
Kenna, NM
Elkins, NM
Roswell, NM
A few little towns later we come to Roswell.  No UFOs today, but they
sure have a lot of pecan orchards there.  Huge trees, visible from miles
away!  We skirted around the edge of town and headed west on US380.

Picacho, NM^Ò
Tinnie, NM
Hondo, NM
Lincoln, NM
We climbed up into the mountains into the Lincoln Historical District. 
Very scenic country, and, for the first time in a week, cooler
temperatures.  A thunderstorm does wonders for our comfort.  We visited
the cemetery in Lincoln and found quite a few interesting stones.  

Capitan, NM
Carrizozo, NM
A crossroad for the most part.  The most fun in Carrizozo is in saying
the name!  Carrizozo had a large park with a pool and recreation center,
but most of it was in disrepair and locked up.  Seems as though a local
doctor died and all the facilities were built with money he left for
that purpose, but then the city apparently didn^Òt have the funds to
maintain the facilities.  Too bad.  Another 2000 miles had gone by, so I
changed oil and adjusted the valves in the motel parking lot.

Bingham, NM
San Antonio, NM
This stretch took us across the ominously-named &quot;Jornada del Muerto.  We
didn^Òt see anything too nasty about it, but we^Òre just as happy the bus
kept running happily.  There was a place that looked like a bar in the
middle of town that had a tiny &quot;CAFÉ&quot; sign, so I stuck my head in the
heavy steel door to take a look.  Well, it looked like a bar, but
families were sitting around so we ventured in.  The Green Chiliburgers
were great!  The place was called the Owl Club.

Socorro, NM
Continued west on US 60 from here.

Magdalena, NM
Datil, NM
Pie Town, NM
Nope, no place here to eat pie.  Sorry!  We recrossed the continental
divide westward here.  Between Magdalena and Datil, in the plains of San
Agustin, we came across the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, a
massive array of huge dishes that can be used in unison to give the
effect of one big dish miles wide.  If you saw the movie Contact, you
get the idea!

Omega, NM
Quemado, NM
Springerville, AZ
Show Low, AZ
We wanted to go along the Mogollion Rim country in Arizona, so we went
through Springerville and into Show Low.  This region caters to the
tourist and the retiree, so there were quite a few places to stay.  We
stayed at the Thunderbird Motel in Show Low, which had a huge classic
neon sign in which all the neon had been restored.  We walked to a
nearby steakhouse which served a fearsome slab of prime rib (&quot;I ordered
the small cut.&quot;  &quot;That _is_ the small cut!&quot;)  By the way, this place
looks like a pretty nasty bar from the street side.  If you go around to
the side of the building, you find a very nice restaurant.  Bizarre! 
The name Show Low comes from a poker hand.  The main street of town is
called &quot;Two Of Clubs Boulevard&quot; and the city seal features a picture of
the playing card.  From Show Low we headed west on AZ260.

Linden, AZ
Overgarrd, AZ
Heber, AZ
Forest Lakes, AZ
Kohl^Òs Ranch, AZ
Payson, AZ
Pine, AZ
Strawberry, AZ
Camp Verde, AZ
Very pretty country, but pretty twisty and turny.  Don^Òt expect to make
quick time through here!  At Camp Verde, we switched to US89A

Cottonwood, AZ
Jerome, AZ
I grew up near Virginia City, NV, and I thought that it was a &quot;city on
the side of a mountain.&quot;  By comparison, Jerome is a &quot;city on the face
of a cliff!&quot;  The quickest way from the top end of town to the bottom
seems to be by parachute!  I^Òm not quite sure where the Jerome Jamboree
is held, but it can^Òt be in the town.  There isn^Òt room!

Prescott, AZ
The trip down the hill from Jerome is spectacular!  The perspective of
the land below is what you usually get from flying in a plane.  That big
square thing below (that I though was some sort of a solar plant) turned
out to be just another feedlot, this one with sunshades for the cattle. 
This hill marked the descent from alpine highlands into the Sonoran
desert.  From Prescott we followed AZ89

Wilhoit, AZ
Kirkland Jct., AZ
Peeples Valley, AZ
Yarnell, AZ
Congress, AZ
Here we headed up US93, the Joshua Tree Parkway, which lives up to its
name with thousands of the spiky trees, which are most closely related
to the lily, of all things! There were also quite a few saguaros along
this route, making me wonder why there are joshua trees in both the
Mojave and Sonoran deserts, but saguaros only in the Sonoran..

Nothing, AZ
This town is everything its name implies.

Wikieup, AZ
Stayed the last night of the trip here at the only functional motel in
town.  Oddly enough, this was the _only_ motel of this entire trip that
didn^Òt have full cable or satellite television!  What a connected
society we are becoming.  The motel was next to a trading
post/restaurant/gas station that featured rattlesnake snacks on its
menu.  Seems that the town of Wikieup bills itself as the &quot;rattlesnake
capital of Arizona.&quot;  We didn^Òt see any rattlers (with two kids walking
with you the rattlers have lots of warning of your approach!).  Funny
thing about the rattlesnake snacks was that the sale of wild game in
restaurants is illegal in Arizona, so the restaurant has to import
canned rattlesnake from Colorado, despite the ready local supply.  The
local school had a very nice playground where the kids played until
after dark.  As we were walking back, we just about got nailed by a Baja
bug that unexpectedly turned onto the trail we were walking.  Seems that
folks thereabouts aren^Òt used to crazy Californians taking nocturnal
hikes!  After a good night^Òs sleep, we headed up US93 and then I-40. 
Like an idiot, I hit a truck tire tread laying in the road and managed
to punch a small hole through the sheet metal below the left end of the
rear bumper.  Dang!

Kingman, AZ
Come to find out, if you^Òre looking for cheap lodging, this is the place
to go.  Lots of prices advertised in the $20 to $30 range, for nice
looking places.  If you^Òre here for dinner, the Dambar steak house is
pretty good.  Bumped into a bus fellow outside a restaurant who wanted
to buy my roof rack.  He was pretty insistent, but I^Òm too attached to
the rack.  He was wearing a Jerome T-shirt, and filled me in a bit on
last year^Òs event.  We headed out on old US66.  Old 66 is showing its
age, and the pavement is pretty rough.  While checking the oil, I noted
that one of the tailpipes (bug muffler) seemed to have grown a couple of
inches.  I pushed it back into place and tightened the clamps a bit.

McConnico, AZ
Goldroad, AZ
This is an active gold mine, with lots of No-Trespassing signs to remind
you of this.

Oatman, AZ
An old mining town, with burros wandering the streets.  Right after
Oatman, my right hand parcel shelf failed at the outer support, dumping
speakers and radios on the floor.  This was exactly the same failure as
the left-hand shelf experienced in Oklahoma.  Failures seem to be
happening in twos for this trip  Had to stop and disconnect the radios
and stow them in the back.

Golden Shores, AZ
Topock, AZ
Across the Colorado river, had to get on I-40 for a bit.

Needles, CA
Had to gas here, and the stations are tricky about pricing.  They put a
low price for propane or diesel on their signs, but the labels
indicating what the price is for are tiny.  I guess that they figure
that by the time you discover their deception you^Òll just go ahead and
pay the high price.

Essex, CA
Amboy, CA
Ludlow, CA
Newberry Springs, CA
These towns along US66 epitomize the term &quot;out in the boonies!&quot;  I
wonder how it felt to cross this stretch in a Model T?  The road along
this stretch was pretty chewed up, with potholes and stray chunks of
asphalt strewn about.  A couple of times I had to cross to the other
side of the road to avoid particularly bad areas of pavement.  I
wouldn^Òt want to run this stretch at night, for fear of hitting one of
those big chunks.

Daggett, CA
Barstow, CA
Used to be the home of the world^Òs largest McDonalds.  The title passed
to Moscow a few years ago.  We kept going on US66.

Lenwood, CA
Hodge, CA
Helendale, CA
Silver Lakes, CA
Oro Grande, CA
Adelanto, CA
Victorville, CA
Victorville is the home of the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans museum.  Yep,
Trigger is stuffed and mounted here.  We left US66 for a brief respite
on US395 and onto CA18.  This is a heavily traveled 2-lane road, not at
all pleasant to drive.  We didn^Òt have much choice.

Llano, CA
Pearblossom, CA
Littlerock, CA
Palmdale, CA
Acton, CA
Canyon Country, CA
Home again.  We arrived on fumes after traveling all the way from
Needles on one tank of gas.  House looked to be in good shape, lawn long
and shaggy, and about 10 pounds of mail in our big mailbox.


Statistics:
We traveled 4458 miles by the GPS, or 4711 miles if you prefer to
believe the odometer.  The GPS also indicates that we averaged 45.6MPH
while we were moving.  The farthest that we actually got from home
(straight line distance) was 1095 miles.  We burned 225 gallons of gas,
which is just a hair under 20MPG.  We used 7 quarts of oil, including
two oil changes.  Valves were adjusted twice, and only one valve
actually needed adjusting each time (exhaust valves on #2 and #4 were
just a hair tight).  Failures on this trip included two broken supports
on my home-made parcel shelves, the loosening of one of the exhaust
tips, tread separations in two tires, and a hole in the rear sheet metal
from a road alligator.

Next year:  The quest for the Mississippi!

End of part 4 which is the last part.  Congratulations if you made it
the whole way with us!  Thanks for riding along!
