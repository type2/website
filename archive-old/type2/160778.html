&gt;We carry this in 205-65R15, which is the same height as the 14&quot; tires found

&gt;snows when we can get them. However Vredestein does not sell a 14&quot; summer
&gt;tire here in the U.S.  Even if they did, it would cost considerably more
&gt;than the 185R14 Hankook RA08, our 14&quot; all-season offering, which IMO is
&gt;definitely the best 14&quot; year-round Bus tire available for anywhere near its
&gt;price...

I took a look at the tires but I have to wonder if the shipping 
doesn't kill you?
Just curious right now but I'll need new tires sometime.
