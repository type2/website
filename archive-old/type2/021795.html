&gt; ahh friday. waiting in line for a ring up at the boneyards, feller in front
&gt; says &quot;am i blocking you in...what are you driving&quot;, and i reply, pickup no
&gt; worries, you're ahead of me anyway. turns out he goofs around and gets back
&gt; to the lot after me. passing by the DC he says, &quot;that's not a pickup, izit,
&gt; well ...MAYbe&quot;.  are them fighting words?   - steve

MOST DEFINITELY DEM BE FIGHTN WORDS!!!  I had to go over to vintagebus_dot_com and
print out the DC spec sheet to prove the load carrying capacity of my '60 DC to
a smart mouthed, Ford driving, coworker.  Nice part was, he's real quiet about
it now.  Doesn't like to be proven wrong.
