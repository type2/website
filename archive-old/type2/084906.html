Subject: Re: [T2] Re: shuddering -was [T2] 2.0L Engine Noise

I thought the point of motor mounts was to isolate the two surfaces from 
each other that the mounts touch.

Basically the mount is two metal plates with studs and there is a layer of 
rubber between these two plates. The rubber is glued to the plates.

Because there isn't a metal stud or bolt through them they cancel the 
noise, vibration, etc.

And it is the metal plate that necessitates the use of the ground strap for 
the electrical system.

 From my perspective the reason that long bolt you have used keeps 
loosening up is b/c the remains of the rubber mount is constantly moving 
and compressing adding and removing tension to this bolt. Not to mention 
the vibration.

Anyone correct me on this???

Mike - don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you're wrong for doing it that 
way. If it works for you then good for you.
