Subject: greasing CV joints

 &gt;I took the cv joints out of our 71 the other day, and they're shot.
&gt;I've ordered 4 new ones and am waiting for them to arrive so I can put them
in.
&gt;   I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried modifying a cv joint so that it
&gt;could have new grease injected using a grease gun.  It would be so much
&gt;easier if I could just go under with a grease gun and gease the cv joint
&gt;while it's installed.  Well, I'll have 4 old ones to experiment with.  If I
&gt;come up with anything promising I'll let you all know.

Hoover Sermons has an article on using a needle to &quot;interim&quot; grease those
buggers, as I recall..
