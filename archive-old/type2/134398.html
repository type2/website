Are you sure it is bad? &lt;snicker snicker&gt;
Here is one for sale on the Samba:

Since it is being sold a shop, I assume it is good = www.type4parts_dot_com ??
Maybe the reddish tint in the pic means the temp is above 180 degrees...... &lt;ha ha ha&gt;


&gt; * Head of piston grew an unwated hole
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Parts72Bus/61-PistonDamage.jpg

Are you sure that is an 1800?  Have you measured the pistons?
Just about every real 1800 I have seen has had flat-top pistons [bus and 412] or domed pistons [914]. The
dished pistons are 2.0L. Measure the bore and see if it isn't 94mm.
What is the casting # on that door stop cylinder head?
