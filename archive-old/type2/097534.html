Subject: Re: [T2] in need of longblock/engine rebuild

[...]

&gt; I am needing to locate an 1800 longblock to start my engine rebuild, but I
&gt; understand there are tools and parts I'm going to need from a machinist.
&gt; 
&gt; First off, where would be a good place to locate a longblock for under a
&gt; grand?
 
Where are you? 
Shipping on a rebuildable engine may cost more than the price of the engine.
