Whilst preparing to order brake repair parts from der Bus Depot, I see
*two* brake hardware kits for the front brakes of my '73 Westy: ATE and
Gihrling. How can I tell which hardware kit I need? I assume - for no good
reason, except that the GDPO never repaired anything that didn't absolutely
demand it, and then used chewing gum to effect the repair - that my brakes
are stock.
