Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor and vacuum advance

on 10/27/03 10:49, Messa, Corbett (IndSys, GEFanuc, NA) related:
 
&gt; So what are the advantages to using a vacuum advance distributor over a 009?
&gt; I see none since the vacuum advance does not seem to do anything until 4th
&gt; gear or when it is cold, according to the manual.


corbett,

i don't quite understand where you are getting this information from the
manual.

there are lots of pages on the 'net which explain why you want vacuum
advance for a street driven car, here is one, picked mostly at random from a
google search:

there are some very good pages on the aircooled_dot_net website, but it seems to
be down at the moment. below is a page, scroll down and read the articles by
john connolly and shad laws:
