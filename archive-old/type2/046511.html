Subject: [Fwd: [T2] if you were/are a mechanic, would it bother you????]

Another list newbie here...

Everything Chris and Kell said!  Me too!  My mechanic has done a few
sloppy things, and now he's saying I need a top end rebuild, but she
sure scoots around the same as ever!  I need teachin' on the basic
maintenance, some good diagnostics, AND maybe do the rebuild myself with
a bit of help???  He's a nice enough guy, but I really don't think he
(or any other mechanic) wants me hanging around and bugging him.

I'm just down in Mountain View, (about an hour south on 101) so maybe we
can share a mentor!  My Sally der Feuergeist is a 72 camper...  1700
porsche engine installed in '75.  (Durned dipstick on the top, there's a
hole drilled in the deck so's you can check the oil.)  Interestingly
enough, the car had 60,000 when it was rebuilt the first time, and I'm
at 118,600 now...

&gt; I guess im looking for a 'keep it runnin' lesson, and im willing to pay
&gt; someone to show me. Im new to the coast otherwise id be calling on the
&gt; friends that used to help me out to come over and show me already. I just
&gt; dont know where to turn, and maybe getting a mechanic to show me will be the
&gt; best bet?
&gt; 
&gt; I just dont want to ask if its something that I should know will piss them
&gt; off. Or if you know a really nice person in the bay area, who will pass on a
&gt; little knowledge for payment of their time and a few beers, let me know!
&gt; 
&gt; in the real rat race, the cheese is poisoned,
&gt; so take your time!

specific.
