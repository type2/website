Subject: Re: [T2] Sportsmobile

[...]

There is a Sportsmobile van conversion company here in Fresno, Calif! I keep
meaning to go by during the day to see if they have any old literature left.

&gt; &gt;Does anybody out there have any info or lit. about sportmobiles?
&gt;
&gt; I believe the Sportsmobiles were conversions were done in the USA. Elkhart
&gt; Indiana to be exact. I've seen literature laying around at shows. I had a 69
&gt; Sportsmobile as a parts bus for a couple of years. Ended up giving it to a
&gt; guy from Carbondale IL. He was going to use it for a parts bus till he
&gt; decided it looked better than the one he was restoring. Last I heard it was
&gt; happily driving around in Illinois.
