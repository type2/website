Subject:  Propane

Hello,
	This is a serious and timely question to put on this list, especially when
gas prices are skyrocketing as they are these days.  Is there anyone out
there who has had experience with a T2 that has been converted to run on
propane or other natural gas?  What does the conversion entail?  Is the
mileage better or worse?  Is it very cost prohibitive to make the
conversion?  Any warnings or cautions I should be aware of?  I was just
thinking that since propane in Oregon seems to be about $1.05 instead of
$1.60 a gallon, this might be something to consider in the long run.
	Or, and this might be pushing it, how about a hybrid (gas, electric), pure
electric, or fuel cell set up?  Any thoughts?  What ever happened to that
holy-grail of a 100 MPG carbeurator I heard about years ago?

Thanks,
