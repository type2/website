Subject: Re: unusual type2 engine number

&gt; the number on my engine case is different from any other bay type2:
&gt; w 019912 G two other things around the number: 1) it begins with a
&gt; small vw stamp, with a clockwise arrow around it; and 2) there is
&gt; -4 above the space between &quot;2&quot; and &quot;G&quot;

I had such an engine in a 1969 Westy, or perhaps this one had a &quot;V&quot;.
Anyway, this engine comes from a VW type 4. This engine number actually
says that this engine was originally fitted in a type 4. Baywindow type
4 engines have different numbers. By the way, there is a whole list of
engine numbers in the type2_dot_com library:

The VW-recycling logo means that this engine has been rebuild by VW
themselves.
