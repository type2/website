I think we watch more TV today.  Or that TV is written now more toward a
short attention span, zip, high paced, emphasis on the action, so as to get
us all into CONSUMER MODE.  Makes me think of those Do the Dew commercials.
It's a wonder we're all so impatient.  And that's what draws me to
aircooleds.  Christopher
