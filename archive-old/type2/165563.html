&gt; Hi Richard,

&gt; Any issues with the fit of the engine to the fuel tank? I have heard
&gt; that can be an issue with baywindow subie conversions.

You can either reverse the intake manifold which requires relocating of
the alternator or use the throttle body reverser from Custom Off-road in
Australia.  They convert a lot of baywindows in Oz.
