Subject: Fw:  bus project for sale IN OHIO



&gt; Hello, my bus project is running out of time and energy and I'm offering
it
&gt; to the list first before I present it to the rest of the world.  It's 74
bus
&gt; with a great incredibly rust free body without motor or tranny.  It was
&gt; originally a automatic bus but you can do what you want with it.  I also
&gt; have a rusty 76 automatic bus,  (complete with yellow jackets) that goes
&gt; with it.  I originally planned on putting the 76 autotranny in the 74 bus.
&gt; I have a strong running 2L motor and BA6 gas heater (complete) which goes
&gt; also.  All you need is time and elbow grease and  you can ride.  You get a
&gt; bus with a great body, a strong 2l FI motor which is in a running bus, a
BA6
&gt; gas heater, a 76 parts bus with autotranny and 2l motor which doesn't run
&gt; for $2000.00 obo. Project is located in OHIO
  Contact me off list for more info and details.  Thanks,
&gt; Marcus
&gt;
