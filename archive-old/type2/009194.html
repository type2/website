&gt; &gt;Has anywone installed a front tire carrier on a 78 Westy?  How do
&gt; &gt;you get to the place to drill for the bolts that pass from the
inside to
&gt; &gt;the outside?
&gt; 
&gt; They are called &quot;jack bolts&quot; and are available in several sizes from
&gt; better-stocked hardware stores.  Properly installed, they will
support as
&gt; much weight as a nut and bolt of similar size.

Before you put the tire on the front, decide if the additional
interior space is really worth it.  I've seen very few buses with
front-mounted spares that didn't have the sheet metal stoved in behind
the spare.  Other drivers seem to think that the tire is a nice soft
cushy bumper!

On the occasions where I carry an extra spare (like when I head to the
boonies or the snow country), the spare goes on my rack.
