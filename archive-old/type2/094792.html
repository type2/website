Subject: Re: [T2] Bus and a BUG question

&gt;Howdy Y'all,
&gt;First of all since this is a BUS list, here's the bus question: I noticed 
&gt;on
&gt;my '71 Westy (1600 DP) that inside the gas filler door there is a little
&gt;sticker that says &quot;Oktan Min. 91 ROZ&quot; I am assuming that this is german
&gt;recommending using gas with a 91 or higher octane rating (A genius, aren't 
&gt;I!)

Here's the catch... the German ROZ measurement is different than the system 
used in the US. The number comes out higher. I don't recall exactly why, 
maybe somebody else can give you a better explanation... but I found out 
after about a year of putting expensive gas in my bus that &quot;oktan 91 ROZ&quot; is 
equivilent to 85 octane over here.
