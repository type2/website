&gt; &gt;        Actually, performance should decrease. Reason being that higher
&gt; &gt;octane just means that they put stuff in it (lead, whatever) to make it
&gt; &gt;harder to ignite -- so that it won't pre-ignite from higher compression
&gt; &gt;ratios -- so ounce for ounce, there is less intrinsic power in higher
&gt; &gt;octane.
&gt;
&gt; respect his knowledge.  So, does this mean that I am &quot;wishful thinking&quot; the
&gt; perceived difference in pep when I switch from regular to higher octane?
&gt;

      Could be -- that sort of thing happens to us all the time in many areas
of life. We expect something to happen -- so it seems to do so. Or even does!
8-)
      Or it could mean that your engine has enough carbon buildup in the
cylinder heads and on the pistons that the compression ratio has increased a
bit or some other reason for higher compression -- like maybe the wrong
cylinder shims, no head gaskets (these are quite possible) -- or maybe your
timing is advanced just a wee bit too much ---- any, or a combo, of the above,
that's causing a bit of pre-ignition to occur with lower octane gas. Maybe not
enough to give you a real detonation (ping) that you notice, but just enough
to de-power the engine.
       Think about it -- the piston comes up on compression, get almost up
there where the spark is going to fire the charge, but then detonation starts,
which tries to push the piston back down, then shortly after that that the
spark goes off, firing what's left of the charge, etc. So the engine is just
running a little crummy on the low octane, then you put higher octane in it
and it runs better.
       It's probably more a problem of the engine not being up to specs. It
could even be just one cylinder that's got the higher compression, and
detonation, and so tries to run at a bit different pace than the other three.
Or maybe it's not even higher compression, maybe it's some gouged metal that
has a ridge that retains enough heat to glow red hot and act like a glow plug
-- any number of things can cause pre-ignition. So even tho your engine is
*supposed* to be a low-compression, low octane engine, it needs higher octane
to run right.


&gt; I'm driving a '79 fuel-injected 2.1 Westy, and in Canada the gasses
&gt; involved are Unleaded:  Regular is Octane 89, Premium varies from 92 to 94
&gt; (92 sometimes called &quot;mid-grade)  I've noticed better ferformance after a
&gt; fill-up with 92, and I almost get speeding tickets when I use the 94.
&gt;

      Or it could just be that you put you foot in it more, eh?  8-)

&gt;
&gt; What &quot;stuff&quot; gets added to unleaded?
&gt;

       There are a number of chemicals used to decrease combustibility.
Alcohol, for one.
