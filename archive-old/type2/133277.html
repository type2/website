&gt; If it's in PARK it shouldn't be spinning a wheel.

true I missed that part
&gt;
&gt; I think maybe the linkage is off a notch.

almost for sure...
&gt;
&gt; If I read the original message correctly,
&gt; PRNDL = What the stick says
&gt; RNDL= What the tranny is doing.
&gt;
&gt; So the stick isn't getting the tranny all the way back to park.
&gt; Something is too loose or too tight, and the adjustment is out of spec.
&gt;
&gt; Disconnect the shifter linkage and manually shift the lever all the way
&gt; back to park. Then connect the linkage and adjust it to read P at the
&gt; lever. Verify that all the other gears are also reading OK, and you're
&gt; good to go.

follow the adjustment instructions in Bentley, however one thing I have
found is that even if there is a little flex in the frame of the van it
can be off a little so make sure the weight is on the wheels when doing
this adjustment.

a little movement in neutral is possible/normal but not in park

Still work on that idle too
