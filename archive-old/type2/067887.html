Subject: welding update

Thanks to all who responded to my rant on welding. It's nice to know there 
are virtual shoulders out there on which to lean when things don't go the 
way you'd like.

I spent the better part of last night hooking up my gas on the Lincoln. 
Finally, late at night, I made my first MIG weld. Damned if it isn't a whole 
new world. Instead of hissing, spitting and burning nearly out of control 
like the flux core wire, the MIG is a placid, beautiful green flame that 
seems perfectly happy to join two pieces of sheet metal in holy matrimony :) 
The first time I touched electrode to metal, my spirits soared. Thoughts of 
my 70 Westy humming along the highway crowded my head. Yes, I told myself, 
by this time next summer, we'll be peacefully camped in Door County 
(Wisconsin), top popped, beer in similar state, fresh fish on the Coleman 
simulating the sound of a MIG electrode with the proper stick out...

Not quite there yet. My welds look a little beady. A good weld is a thing of 
beauty. Mine so far are a thing of utility. Practice, practice, practice 
before I takle that rusty window, and those holes in the cargo floor. Oh 
yeah, and that rusted out rear fender panel. And those coupla holes where 
the driver's feet go, etc.
