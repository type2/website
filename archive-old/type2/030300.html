&gt; Again, my curiosity has been piqued:  has anyone who experienced
&gt; rear wheel bearing failure and replaced only the one that failed, later
&gt; experienced failure in the other wheel?

I replaced the driver's side bearings on my '71 a year ago.  No problems
on the passenger side yet, though I bought a set of wheel bearings and
seals from Ronnie to cover myself if it fails.

My driver's side was going out for about 3000 miles, staring as a small
vibration that was hard to localize.  I though that a tire was going out
of balance.  I drove it like that from Montana, through South Dakota and
south to New Mexico and Arizona.  Ignorance is Bliss.  The outer bearing
had its inner race cracked in two places, one almost the width of the
bearing.  After the bearing came out, the cracked piece lifted easily from
the race.  Scary!
