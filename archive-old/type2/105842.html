Subject: Re: [T2] 12 volt fan for sleeping area?

&gt;Can someone recommend a nice 12 volt fan (or pair of fans) that could be mounted/clipped to the ceiling to cool my wife and I as we sleep (on the fold out bed, not the cot)  Opening the louvered windows and rear hatch (with screen) doesn't cool us enough.  Also, the fan(s) could help blow away the mozzies that sneak into the bus each night. Does an oscillating type of 12v fan exist?

Sure, I think I bought mine at Wal Mart.  That doesn't help you much though, since I don't think there are many Wally Worlds in Central America... right?  Maybe I'm wrong about that.  Anyway, I would follow the truck drivers.  Truckers love those fans and you will therefore find them in every truck stop or large filling station on the highway, even (especially?) in Central America, I would guess.

&gt;I have a second battery with a battery separator so I'm not too concerned if the fan(s) suck a lot of power, although the more efficient the fan(s) the better.

Computer fans are fairly efficient and also cheap, but they are not oscillating.
