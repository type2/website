Subject: Re: [F] The Kristin Laurite Fund, Inc (Murder)



This is an update on the Kristin Laurite Fund:

Not that I'm in the center of fund raising efforts (I will only know you
donated if you tell me), so I can't be sure of the response from the
Internet's VW community, but from my limited vantage it has been
underwhelming. There have been some donations but not what I would have
thought!

Personally I had to wait for a payday, so I'm mailing my own check
tomorrow. I hope that's your situation as well, dear reader. =^ ) Let's
pull together on this thing, please. People should not be murdered at
rest areas and sociopaths should not run around loose. Please
contribute, and see Stephen's web site here if you don't know what I'm
talking about:

&gt; This seems like a good cause. For those who are new, an young lady named
&gt; Kristin Laurite was murdered while traveling cross-country in a 71 bus
&gt; this summer. Her killer has not been apprehended. Stephen Gutknecht
&gt; maintains a web page with news about this:
&gt;
&gt;         http://www.yourvw_dot_com/Kristin/
&gt;
&gt; For every person who donates $30 or more to the Kristin Laurite Fund, we
&gt; are offering free type2_dot_com email forwarding; you can use the incredibly
&gt; prestigious address &lt;yourchoice_at_type2_dot_com&gt; as a return address, and all
&gt; mail sent to &lt;yourchoice_at_type2_dot_com&gt; will magically end up in your mailbox.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, so maybe I'm overly optimistic about the prestige of a type2_dot_com
&gt; address, but note that I'm pretty good at spam filtering; donate
&gt; something over $30 and watch me make your spam disappear.
&gt;
&gt; (No, I can't keep spam out of RAMVA. Cleaning newsgroups requires
&gt; forgery and I don't do forgery.) =^ )
&gt;
&gt; Folks, please pony up, and let's put the psychopath who did this in a
&gt; cage where he can't hurt my daughters or yours.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a fund raising attempt, created by people who love Kristin (such as
&gt; &gt; her mother and uncle), to raise money to help her family pay for the huge
&gt; &gt; expenses this tragety has created. Besides funeral expenses and future
&gt;legal
&gt; &gt; expenses,  attempts to apprehend the killer have been very expensive,
&gt; &gt; yet necessary.  Flyers have been hung throughout the country, 3 billboards
&gt; &gt; have been put up in Arkansas, and to run one article for one day in US News
&gt; &gt; costs $16,000.  Any donation amount is really appreciated.
&gt; &gt; The fund is a non-profit fund and donations are not tax deductable.
&gt; &gt; -All donations should be sent to...
&gt; &gt;                 The Kristin Laurite Fund, Inc.
&gt; &gt;                 P.O. Box 157
&gt; &gt;                 Fanwood, NJ 07023
&gt; &gt; -Any money left over, after the killer is found and apprehended, will be
&gt; &gt; donated to two charity organizations that Kristin would have been proud to
&gt; &gt; help out.  Kristin was very fond of both:  teaching chilren and dogs.  She
&gt; &gt; was a pre-school teacher for years and was the best dog owner I have ever
&gt; &gt; met.  Any remaining money, when there is closure, will be donated to...
&gt; &gt;     A.    The Seeing Eye:  An organization that breeds there own dogs and
&gt; &gt; trains people who then train these dogs.  The Seeing Eye then gives these
&gt; &gt;  dogs to blind people who could benefit from the help of the dogs, in
&gt; &gt; their daily life including blint teachers.  The Seeing Eye has been around
&gt; &gt; since 1929 and is located in Morristown, NJ
&gt; &gt;     B.    Saint Hubert's Animal Welfare Center:  An organization located in
&gt; &gt; Madison, NJ.  The donations will go specifically to the part of the
&gt; &gt; organization called Pet Partners/ Pet Therapy.  They use dogs to go to
&gt; &gt; children hospitols to lift up spirits, schools, girl/ boy scouts, pet
&gt; &gt; education....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sincere Thanks in advance for all contributions,
&gt; &gt; Nicole (Best friends with Kristin since nursery school)
