Subject: Farting, missing but compression okay
Message-ID: &lt;34dec147.24612871_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Now, I've got that 1975 Westie with a 1972 412 FI engine in it, and one 
&gt;cylinder is at 75 psi (the other three are at ~130). which my FLARS 
&gt;diagnosed as the cause for my illegally high hydrocarbon 
&gt;emissions. 

This problem trumps any emissions issues. You need to get that compression
over 100, and thats no guarantee that your emissions problems will go away, 
but
at least you'll then have a fighting chance.

&gt;Can I somehow disable the injector on that bum cylinder, and bring my 
&gt;HCOs into a legal range?  Please note that this would be a temporary 
&gt;expedient, and I know that I'm due a valve replacement anyway, but would 
&gt;this work?  If so, how would I go about it?

Unless missing the sticker would make you lose the bus, I wouldn't go down 
this path. Many things are probably possible, but I can't imagine a bus 
running on 3 cylinders passing a dyno emissions test. Worse yet, if you get 
the sticker you may be tempted to drive it around on 3 and half cylinders, 
and that isn't the way Hans Nordoff envisioned things before he went to bed 
at night.
