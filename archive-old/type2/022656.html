Subject: motor noise question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

My brand new rebuild motor with less than 3 miles runs fine but sounds like 
there is metal grinding together somewhere.  Its like a shimmering sound 
below the usual purr of a 1600 dp.  Sounds like its coming from the 
alternator.  Does anybody know what this is?
