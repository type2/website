Subject: 'Pegasus' for sale

Due to changes in my plans I had to make some tough
decisions. Parting with 'Pegasus' is one of them.

My trusted and much loved '75 baywindow is now
looking for a new home. Under the circumstances
it seems wiser to let her share future years with an
active owner than sit in a barn for two years and may
be get back to swinging her flaps in the next century.

All is standard Type2, although I know that she used to
have an automatic transmission. The engine is running
but needs work. [Information from my Zen mechanic
in Mountain View who cared for her will be available.]
There are three dime-sized rust spots at the windshield
lower lip; that's all. She's very solid and clean, White
over cream. The seats were replaced by the PO. in 1990.
Except for a brief break of 3 years in Austin, TX, she spent
her years in No CA (Salinas, Menlo Park). Three high tower
Thule bars along with a rack over the front are mounted
on top. (I used to cary a kayak) Fitting, blue water cans
come with it. The sliding door lock needs work but is
functional. A U-Haul hitch was installed for mounting a
bicycle carrier; both come with it.

The radio is a (coded) Blaupunkt pull-out with cassette
player, with Blaupunkt speakers mounted front and back.
I converted the back to a simple sleeper out of brightly
finished birch ply and dark grey carpeting with tons of
storage space underneath the bed. I had planned to
install volt, amp, and [sump] oil temp meters but never
got around to that. Also, I have a set of louvered windows
[Westy] which, again. I never got around to putting in.
All will be included.

The only liability I have to tell you about is that you will
get stopped by people wanting to buy her. If you can
cope with that you've got yourself a great bus.

I live in Aromas, CA, a little town 40 miles S of San Jose.
All reasonable offers will be considered. Please respond
off-line. Thanks for your interest.
