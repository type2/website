Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [WetWesties] Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust
  manifold flanges on our head...

David, 

Every once in awhile Courtney comes up with a real good one. This was
one of them moments. 

Instead of asking if the job could be done, he should have qualified
himself and asked with his limited welding experience could he weld a
1/4&quot; flange plate to a sheet metal box. 
In his first post.
The answer is simple.
No. 
I'm trying to be realistic here. 

I mentioned air welding.
What's that? 

It's a common happening when trying to attach two pieces of iron, or tin
and one is rusted up. 

He might as well be trying to weld air cause he's gonna have a bunch of
spaghetti welds where the metal should have been. Whats a spaghetti
weld? 

A bunch of strands of wire hanging on the inside of the weld where it
didn't attach to anything. 
The list goes on with explanations. 

And a guy can explain till the cows come home on how to get the job
done. 

But realistically it's another internet impossibility. 
Welding can't really be explained, it has to be experienced. 

It's a self experienced art, and in this case for Courtney to ask if it
can be done--- 
Well sure it can. 
Just not by him yet. 

Not bum rapping anyone--just advising him that it ain't gonna happen
with his goose neck in his hand, with no welding experience, technique,
or know how. 

He cannot weld that flange to the sheet metal surrounding the exhaust
manifolds. 
Not now anyway. 

I'm am sorry. 
It's a fact of life that can't be avoided, and without an ounce of
sarcasm sprinkled in for effect. 

I should be more agreeable. 
Yea--go ahead Courtney---crank that 110 unit to the max and stick that
flange on that sheet metal---yea--go for it. 

What an injustice, and a lie. 
I ain't being self rightous---I'm warning him. I let him know that in
his postion he can't / shouldn't do the job . 

As soon as he mentioned he wasn't sure about the difference between cast
iron &amp; cold rolled, I knew he was going to have troubles. 

Jerks are in the eyes of the beholder.

I tried to save the guy from screwing up what he might have left of his
heat exchanger's, prior to him blowing man holes in them and your
telling me I'm on the wrong page.

Huh.

You sure can't make all of the people happy all of the time.

(A.L.)
