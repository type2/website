&gt; but not my particular situation. I was filling up the other day and noticed

&gt; Looking into the engine compartment, the far left-hand side was soaked
&gt; with gas. I reached up the tubes that lead into the airscoop to see if
&gt; they were wet with gas and they weren't. I guess the gas must be coming
&gt; from the overflow vent farther back. Any one have any ideas about common
&gt; placed this leak might occur and access points?


this problem drove me nuts for almost 2 years, finally found it, the air
tube that runs from the gas tank had a crack at one of the flexible
joints.

couldn't see it, or anything,  

reach up into the air duct and find the small plastic tube, follow it,
there are 2 90degree turns that use flex hose, old and cracked...
