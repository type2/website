Subject: AVP Experiences

I have read the archives regarding AVP, but since they're down for
improvements today (thanks Steve!), and with it being Friday and all, I
thought I'd post a request for experiences with AVP.

Some familial generosity has led to a opportunity to obtain an AVP 1800.
I've called them and talked to them about their engines and materials.

Please p-mail with info and I'll summarize to the list to save bandwidth.

Thanks! Joe
