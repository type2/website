&gt; What &quot;mild&quot; cam is recommended for solid lifters in these busses?  I
&gt; don't plan on racing, but I'd like a little more pep.  It'll also help
&gt; take advantage of the bigger valves.

since your putting in a new cam, consider going to hyd lifters and cam?!


&gt; What exhaust is recommended for use with a mild cam and bigger valves?

if you can find a dutch Stainless steel muffler and 72-74 header set use
those, best made

you should be fine, good luck
