Just had mine off the other day (71).  After you get the two screws out, it
comes off by pushing it up and out of the slot at the top edge.  If you have
not taken it off in a while, this will take some doing, as the plastic
&quot;bead&quot; at the top edge holds it in tight.  If merely pushing up on the thing
doesn't dislodge it, methods of persuasion include:

Block of wood and a hammer
Rubber mallet

I'd suggest pushing/pounding on the ends, where there is more strength.

You all are awsome - you Rock! I got my lights working
perfectly. Now for the sliding door. I need to take
the guard off. I see the two screws at either end, but
after that how is it attatched? Won't seem to come
loose. Do I need to remove it to put the slide block
back in? Thanks again for all your help...
