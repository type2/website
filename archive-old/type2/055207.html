Subject: New CV Boot Rotton!


&gt; While I was dropping my engine today I noticed the CV boot I put on last
&gt; summer looks like its 30 years old!
&gt; Not just a little crack but huge dry rot cracks and large openings. I got
my
&gt; boot from RMMW last summer. Is this normal? It was only $16.00 - came with
&gt; grease and hardware- but my gosh! one year!
