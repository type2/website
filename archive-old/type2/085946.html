Kyle,

Welcome. I almost advised you to quit while you are ahead but your comment 
that you had fixed the horn gave me pause. If you can fix the horn on a VW 
you show real promise. Smog can be a challenge.

Just as a start you must pass SMOG to register the bus in California.

If your bus hasn't had to meet very strict smog specifications up till now 
you may have to replace some rather hard to find and expensive parts.

Step 1 is to determine if your bus is 49 State(Fed) model or a California 
model. The engine door should have the info written inside the lid.

Step 2 get a look at service manual (Robert Bentley is good) and compare 
your exhaust and fuel injection components to those in the manual.

My last time thu smog with a 1977 bus I did the work. I had to:

1. Replace the Egr Filter $138
2. Replace the Cat Converter $125
3. Replace The Egr Valve (1979 may not have one) $200 (rebuilt)
4. Replace the Fuel Filler Restrictor $150 (long story)
5. Pull and clean the air distribution manifold. (not fun)
6. Fix a wiring problem so the erg light would work
7. New plugs, points
8. Set the C0 level with a exhaust analyzer

I would guess that you will face a similar fate unless you have a close 
relative that runs a smog test station.

Good luck

&gt;Hi,
&gt;This is my first time posting on the list.  I just bought my first vw, 
&gt;which is also my first car.  It is a 79 Westfalia.  I bought it from out of 
&gt;state.  Now the only problem is I live in CA and have to pass smog.  I 
&gt;don't have a lot of experience with cars.  I have read the Bently, Haynes, 
&gt;and Muir manuals.  I have a small selection of tools and am willing to do 
&gt;the work.  I enjoy doing the work.  I am willing to buy more tools if 
&gt;practical and necessary.  My problem is I don't know where to start.  I 
&gt;have very little money and don't want to start investing it in parts that 
&gt;don't need to be fixed.
&gt;The bus runs.  The body and interior are in pretty nice shape.  I have 
&gt;fixed the speedo, t/s switch, and horn.  Now I'm getting into the nitty 
&gt;gritty work.
&gt;The exhaust was entering the cab until I removed the bellowed tubes 
&gt;underneath.  There is a small oil leak also.  I have found oil on the 
&gt;concrete where it is parked.  However the leak is minimal.  In the month+ 
&gt;that I have owned the bus it has not noticeably effected the oil level.  
&gt;The exhaust is pretty strong, so I don't think it will pass smog without 
&gt;some work.
&gt;One person told me I just needed a new valve cover gasket.  Another told me 
&gt;I needed new heater boxes.  Another person told me it probably had to do 
&gt;with the fuel injection.
&gt;Can anyone help me figure out where to start?
&gt;Also, can any one recommend a cheap mechanic in the CA bay area, or anyone 
&gt;who knows more about vws than I do and wants to make some cash.  I live 
&gt;near Palo Alto (in the south bay).  Also, can anyone recommend a cheap 
&gt;parts distributor, new or used.)
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Kyle
