Hey all,

My wife &amp; i am planning to go from the Raleigh area to Baltimore the 1st

I'm looking for a nice / safe campground to stay at in the close
vicinity to Baltimore.  preferably an all night camp ground w/out &quot;gates
lock at 9pm&quot; since I will not get to campground till ~1130, 12 pm

Appreciate any inside info
