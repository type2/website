Subject: NOT sad news, but a question

I'm going to do a search through the archives re: oil leaks, but
I have a quick question before I do. Should the oil drain plug on
a T4 motor have a washer (1977, original motor)? I noticed when
draining it for the first time yesterday that it didn't and I
thought I remembered that the T1's did. I have an oil leak and it
looks like it's from around that plug and from the oil filter
(new filter didn't help). Note this is not the screen plate, but
the oil drain plug to the left of the screen plate. Oh, and
another question: what's that plate at the bottom of the oil
filler tube for? Looks like it's held on by 2 10mm bolts?
Bentley's manual is on the way from Amazon, but my curiosity has
forced me to ask here. Sorry for the T4 newbie questions!

Alex Vieira
