Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window update

Interesting.  I don't know anything about 'brazing.'  I know  welding is fusing metals together electolytically.  Is brazing  just fusing metals together by heating them until they melt  together?  What kind of material does one use to braze metals  together?  It must hold up pretty well if yours has withstood 10  years of cranking.  I roll mine up and down several times a  day.  What do you need to do it besides a good blowtorch?   Thanks....KR

don't remember if you have to remove the window frame
- if so, that is the worst part. If you can avoid
doing that, the rest is gravy. -BaH

&gt; Well, I tore into my driver's side window that
&gt; wouldn't come back  up.  It appears that the part
&gt; that attaches to the bottom of the  window has
&gt; broken apart from the part that screws it to the 
&gt; slider.  I have another door I've been saving for
&gt; Billy and it has  the same problem.  (Sorry, Billy) 
&gt; I've been unable to get  the part off of the bottom
&gt; of the window.  I don't really want to  break the
&gt; glass.   I guess once I got it off, I could have it 
&gt; welded back onto the part with the screws.  I may
&gt; look and see if  I can find one online.  But I doubt
&gt; it.  Any ideas?   Surely somebody else has had this
&gt; problem.  Too cold now to drive  without it.
