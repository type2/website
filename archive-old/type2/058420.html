Subject: RE: Westy Sink Pump another idea

[...]
This is one of those rare instances where something labeled &quot;marine&quot; is 
actually less expensive than an &quot;RV&quot; counterpart.  Savvy boaters know that a 
large percentage of the &quot;marine&quot; stuff is simply standard automotive/RV stuff 
re-packaged and &quot;price-enhanced&quot;.

The 12V electric bilge pumps Mike mentioned are really amazing bits of 
engineering.   They'll absorb a great deal of abuse, are durable, reliable and 
inexpensive.  

Since they're essentially &quot;trash pumps&quot;, that use a centrifugal pumping design 
with clearances to handle &quot;chunky&quot; liquid, they'll pump just about any fluid 
that'll pour.  This design also means running with a blocked outlet tube 
doesn't phase them, they just spin merrily away with no negative effect to the 
impeller or housing. Most can run dry for extended periods without damage.  
And they are, by design, fully submersible.

The smallest generally available capacity is 300 or 350 gallons per hour.  300 
GPH may not sound too impressive, but that's a lot of water.  The outlets 
usually take a 1&quot; I.D. hose and are barbed for a push on connection.  And even 
the smallest have a lift capacity of several feet.  

Lots of possibilities here for VW camper water systems,  either newly designed 
and installed or rehabbing of existing systems. 

My 1970 Campmobile doesn't use an electric water pump, but if it did this 
would be my choice for a replacement unit.

&gt;&gt;.....so I went to the boating/fishing section of my local Walmart and 
purchased a bilge pump for like $10 and a piece of hose and some fittings at 
the local hardware store for about $2..... &lt;&lt;
