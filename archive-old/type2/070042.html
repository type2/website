Speaking as one who has done some work with Fibre glass in on boats.  Working
with Gel Coat is likely to be a pain in the rear. To get a good finish you
really need to spray it.  I would take the approach of making repairs with bondo
and well applied fibreglass cloth and resin followed up with a thorough  sanding
and a couple of coats of a good urethane paint.  As far as I'm concerned the key
piece of equipment for working with fibreglass, bondo, etc. is a good 7 inch
grinder with a good soft pad.  rough it out with a 36 grid disc,  finish up with
60 grit on the soft pad.    John Jensen in Annapolis
