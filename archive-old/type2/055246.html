Subject: Re: Anti-roll/Sway bar mounting

Have just done this on my 79 1600 dp. Thought it was going to be a real PITA 
to crimp the metal plate around the rubber mounting but in fact was real 
easy by using 2 pair of mole/vice grips to gradually squash the sides 
together enough to tap the keeper plate on. Took about 20 mins each side 
with wheels off the ground.
