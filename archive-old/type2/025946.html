As other list people are chiming in about their sightings, let me put in
mine:

After a couple of emails from Nikki and Steve, they finally showed up at my
house here in Oceanside, at about 4 PM, PDT Friday. Steve and Nikki in
Steve's '80 Westy with Virginia plates. Since they had both been here
before, they knew how to find our place quite easily. Welcomed them in with
the promise of beverages and eventually a bar-be-que. Steve was anxious to
see the progress that I had made to my '71 Crew-Cab, as he had been quite
instrumental in helping me solve wiring problems long distance, using email
and 'Bell' methods. Many's the night we would start off with emails, then
resort to the phone, when Steve would direct me to 'go out to the garage and
look at this on my bus,' and he would be in Virginia looking a his bus as a
point of reference. Then send me back in to look to my computer at the
pictures he had just taken then posted of his bus showing me how it should
look, with his finger pointing to the object! Solved several problems this
way. What a guy! But, at this time, my bus was in San Diego at Bill Mays
place having rusty metal cut out and good German steel being welded back in
it's place. So we sat around and talked about his exploits on his trip to
the West coast. Nikki and Steve had spotted the Ecology Junk yard as they
came in to Oceanside, and really wanted to check it out, but  my wife Amy
was due in any moment, so we decided to wait for her, instead.

After awhile, Amy showed up and got a nice chicken bar-be-que started, and
we George Foreman grilled some terrific Salmon steaks that Steve had picked
out. Between all that good food and Steve and Nikki's stories and laughter,
we had a great time. Talked about buses, and list people, and Steve got on
the computer and showed us some great shots he had taken on his trip over.
About the time they were to leave, Amy remembered that we had forgotten
dessert, so we all came back in and had chocolate pie and big glasses of
milk, and then we said our goodby's and got a promise from Steve to come
back and visit the next time he came to Socal.

Steve is such a fun and knowledgable guy, and Nikki is always a pleasure to
be around, that we had a great visit, and look forward to the next time.

He'll be headin back home soon with lot's of pictures and memories.

Have a good, safe trip home, Steve.

Don and Amy Boneau
Oceanside, Ca.
