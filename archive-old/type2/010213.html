Hi Ed,
    After reading your post to the type2 list I've got an idea about the 
brake problem.  This is based on experience with a 77 we used to have.  The 
brake booster has 2 hoses that attach to it.  On the back there is the 
vacuum line from the engine compartment.  On the front side there is one 
that goes forward, through the left front wheel well and sticks into a hole 
in the body.  Actually it opens to ambient air and relieves the vacuum.  If 
this is clogged it might cause the problems with the brakes.  The vacuum 
would have no way to be relieved, would suck the diaphragm in the booster 
back, which would allow the pedal to come down on its own.
    I found out about this forward hose one very cold winter, the brakes 
would drag when the temperature got below freezing.  After spending days 
working on the wheels in subfreezing temperatures, out in the driveway, I 
removed the vacuum booster and found it with ice in the bottom half.  After 
removing the ice the brakes worked fine.  I never even knew that hose was 
there until then.  Evidently water had been accumulating in the booster 
because the end of the hose came out of the hole it was supposed to be in 
and was exposed to the elements.
    I hope this helps
