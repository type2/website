Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

&gt;
&gt; So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
&gt; &quot;comparison&quot;.
&gt;


As it happens, I have had the opportunity to compare these two distributors
on the same motor, running the same grade of fuel, same plugs, same driving
conditions, etc, etc.

There is NO COMPARISON! While the bus runs with the 009, it doesn't run
well, just well enough. With the SVDA from Aircooled_dot_net, I have better
take-offs, more power at high speeds, better hill climbing power, and gained
3 MPG in the city and on the highway. I *think* the motor is running cooler
but I have no evidence to support that claim. Once I install my guages and
develop baseline data, I may put the 009 back in for a time to compare
readings. (I still carry the 009 as an emergency spare--I know I can make it
run well enough to get me home.)
