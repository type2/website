Subject: Re: [T2] 5 speed gearbox

AFAIK, there is no difference in the engine/trans setup between late
(2.0) bays and the 2.0 AFC Vanagons, so there should be no
interchangeability problems there. It's when you get into
post-late-'83 watercooled stuff that you start running into problems.
Also, I may have missed something here, but the only Vanagons that
ever had 5-sp trannys were Syncros, and in that case first gear was
only a &quot;granny gear,&quot; leaving essentially four useable speeds.
Otherwise, all manual Vanagon gearboxes through '91 were four speeds.
Oh, and please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this...

&gt; Mark,
&gt;
&gt; Now *I'm* confused.
&gt;
&gt; I've got an 81 parts vanagon...are you saying the tranny from it will work
&gt; in a late 70's bus?
&gt;
&gt; The only reason I haven't pulled the engine and tranny is because I
&gt; thought the tranny wouldn't fir my 78.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
