Subject: Re: [T2] What is it with the 009?



&gt; Before I go on, Thomas Tarka's post about his 009 is prompting me to
&gt; write this, but I'm not insulting him for trying something because I've
&gt; done the same.  He's just another of the MANY that keep trying the 009,
&gt; which brings me to my next point..
&gt; 
&gt; Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  I don't get it,
&gt; ESPECIALLY if you already have a vacuum advance distributor.  Let's say
&gt; in the worst case scenario where the vacuum advance isn't working, it's
&gt; just like an 009 anyways (except for maybe a different centrifugal
&gt; advance curve) so you might as well just leave the thing in there.

Well, John Muir started it in the idiot book.  He vastly preferred the centrifugal advance distributor.

Also, racers use 'em because they run at high RPM and want all the advance in all the time anyway.  If it works for racers, many people 
think, it must work for street cars.  (flawed logic, how many top fuel dragsters do you see on the morning commute?)

The parts merchants add to the myth, since 009s are commonly available and will work (marginally) on just about anything.

The other problem is that the vacuum advance distributors are getting harder and harder to find.  The cost of rebuilding one is more than 
the cost of a 009.  Cheap drives out good.
