Subject: Re: Dropped seats

Matt,
i have seen them go in and out.   if the seat has
dropped or is starting to drop then the valve should
stick farther into the head, away from the piston.  
if the seat comes loose and starts to come away from
the head it can make the valve go closer to the
piston.   if you catch this early the valve and seat
will likely be going away from the pistons.   this is
the time to get a new head and replace before major
problems arise.   a compression check should help you
diagnos a bad valve.
have a great weekend everyone

&gt; If my valves were dropping seats, would the
&gt; adjusters have more threads on
&gt; the outside of the nut, or less threads on the
&gt; outside of the nut?
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, would the valves themselves (and
&gt; thus the seats) be moving
&gt; towards the pistons or away from the pistons?
&gt;
