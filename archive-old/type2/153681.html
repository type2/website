Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes Squealing

    Check the drums for a &quot;rough thread like&quot; turned surface. The cutter
starts at the inside of the drum, and is fed thread like out to the edge of
the drum. If your machinists set the feed speed to fast, or cut to deep on
his final cut. It may have a &quot;thread&quot; like grooved surface on the drum. The
shoe will try to follow the &quot;groves&quot; away from the backing plate. This
&quot;walking&quot; against the backing plate may be causing a squeal.
    Talk to him, ask if His last cut was at the slowest speed, and at a very
slight cutting depth. Maybe he was in a hurry to go to lunch??????
    Also you should have very small amount of brake lube on all moving
contact points, of the shoes/backing plate, and at the shoe ends where they
set in the adjusters and the wheel cylinders, and spring mating points. As
the brakes are applied any of the contact points are subject to make noise,
and should be lubed.
    The hand brake cables most likely pull at enough of an angle to keep the
shoes in a bind so they don't make noise as you apply them by hand.

&gt; Confession to the list: my rear brakes squeal. The shoes are chamfered
&gt; and the drums are turned. They do not squeal if actionned by the
&gt; handbrake. The hardware kit is new and i'm pretty sure it's installed
&gt; right.
&gt;
&gt; They only squeal when braking pressure is low to medium. Higher baking
&gt; intensity makes no squeal.
