Well, it's finally happened. I find myself deleting all your posts without
reading them, because I just don't have time. I have a car now, and with
my bike and my new boyfriend, Skutter's restoration is on the back burner.

One final question, I bought a new set of heat exchangers from the Bus
Depot, but I've had a terrible time getting the old ones off. Any tips or
tricks? If you send them to the list, please CC me privately, since the
next message I send out will be my un-sub message.

So, this is it, I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave. Thanks so much to
all of you, for your help and support. I'll miss you all terribly, even
though I know I will enjoy the extra time and lack of clutter in my email.

One of my plans is to finish my 'Bus Love' pages, so if anyone has hot
links they think I should include, please send 'em so I can check them
out!

Kate, Skutter (71 bus), and Hannah the Saab

``Batch #37 _ There is a point where pleasure and pain intersect. A
doorway to a new dimension of sensual euphoria where fire both burns and
soothes, where heat engulfs every neuron within you. Once the line is
crossed, once the bottle is opened, once it touches your lips, there is no
going back. '' --- label on a bottle of hot sauce called Pain Is Good
