He probably should be flogged, as well.  I won't publish his name, but any
locals who want to know I will tell.  Best just to stay away.

&gt;A bad $45 align bore almost made Blake give up on VWs.

This is true.  However, Dave's persistence and dedication have paid off.
I now have a wonderful bus (2,400 miles and counting on the new engine)
and am fired up about becoming an all-VW family.  I am currently in search
mode for some other old VW, and my wife is trading her T*y*ta in on a 1999
Jetta TDI.  Three VWs, can't beat that.

I am confident that I can handle any problem that comes up after the 2
year long fiasco that was my last engine rebuild.  Never again.

I owe it all to Dave, with special mention to the List as well.
