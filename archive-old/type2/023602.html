&lt;&lt; as anyone heard of Extend? I'm guessing that its this product:
http://www.loctiteproducts_dot_com/Loctite_Products/RustTreatmentCleaners/NavalJel

lyRustTreatments.cfm?plid=16
Also while looking for Extend I found something called Corroless, has anyone 
heard of this? &gt;&gt;

Extend is a brand of phosphoric acid that converts iron oxide to iron 
phosphate - an in-
ert form that differs from ordinary rust in that it doesn't continue to form. 
It still re-
quires a primer and a top coat and ANY rust that is not converted WILL 
continue to
rust, sometimes ruining the whole process...
Corroless is sold by Eastwood Restoration products from their website and 
catalog. 
They have the usual hyperventilated claims for it, but I don't know of anyone 
who's
actually used it for verification...
