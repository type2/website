Subject: Re: Removing door pannels (plastic sheet)

Jeff,

The other post (about using 1 mil sheeting) sounded good to me, but I have
not had to do this (see below).  In my case, if I had to, I would probably
use whatever was at hand (we always have a roll or two of plastic sheeting
about, more often the 3-4 mil), but the 1 mil will do. 

Back on my first bug (years and years ago) I shredded the plastic, left it
out when I reassembled the door and paid the price (a *very* breezy winter
:-0).  Since then I have been very, very careful removing them so the
issue of replacement had not come up. A slow steady pull will take it off
without stretching or tearing it too badly and duct tape will mend any
tears you do make.

Usually the residual adhesive on the door is plenty to reinstall, but if
you have cleaned it off (for repainting or some such) then there is a 3M
spray trim adhesive that works dandy.  As I remember it comes in regular
and Mongo! strengths.  I bought the regular as I want to be able to remove
anything I install and it has worked just fine.  Be sure to mask
thoroughly, as that stuff is a bear to get off.
