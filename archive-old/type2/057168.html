Subject: Re: fuel injection part / opinions needed

  I then pulled the plug off of the #2
&gt;injector and hooked my test light up to the plug.  When I turned the 
engine,
&gt;the light didn't flash as it should, signifiying that my injectors 
weren't
&gt;being told when to fire.  

  Now I pulled the plug off an injector
&gt;again.  The positive power that comes from the double relay was fine... 
with
&gt;the light hooked to it and a different ground, it lit up.  The ground 
side
&gt;that comes from the electronic control unit didn't make it's ground
&gt;connection that is supposed to make the injector fire.  I checked 
continuity
&gt;of the wire form the #2 injector to the harness on the ECU, and there 
was no
&gt;break in the wire.    My
&gt;diagnosis of the problem is that the part of my ECU that makes my 
injectors
&gt;fire every other time the points open is fried, but the rest of the ECU 
is
&gt;still functioning.  Is that possible?  Do I need a new ECU as I so 
strongly
&gt;suspect?  Does anyone have a used one laying around as described above?

Well ECU failures are very rare but it sounds like that's what you've 
got.  There is only one part to the ECU and that is the part that fires 
the injectors.  The ECU does nothing else.  

So when you connect your multimeter to the terminals in the injector 
plug (red lead of meter to one of the connections in the plug, black 
lead to the other connection IN THE PLUG and NOT to a separate ground) 
and crank the engine, you should observe a &quot;flickering&quot; voltage on the 
meter (this is probably easier to see with a test lamp) as the ECU 
grounds and ungrounds the injectors.  You should NOT see a steady 
voltage reading if the engine is cranking.  In fact, if you have hooked 
the meter up correctly you should see no voltage reading if the engine 
is not cranking.  You should see the flickering reading if the engine is 
cranking.  A steady reading while the engine is cranking (indicating ECU 
is constantly grounding the injectors, holding them open) or no reading 
while the engine is cranking (indicating the ECU is not grounding them 
at all) would indicate to me a defective ECU.  

The ECU gets its engine rpm info from that connection to the negative 
terminal on the coil, so make sure that wire is on the right side of the 
coil.  Hate to replace the ECU just because the wire was on the wrong 
terminal!

So it sounds like your diagnosis is pretty well correct.  You may want 
to try opening up the ECU, you may get lucky and find a broken solder 
joint that can be easily repaired for $10 to your local electronics 
buddy :-)

Anything I'm missing, listmembers?
