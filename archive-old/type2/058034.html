Hi everyone 

well this is the first time I have posted to the list. Usually I just 
use all of you as a great reference but... 

I have been on the middle of a road trip across Canada and now I am, er 
was, heading back when I ran into a little problem. 

It seems that just after I had ran out gas (the gauge is 1/2 broken) and 
was pulling back on to the freeway when I heard a loud crack, sort of 
like a bungee cord 
snappimg and whacking a piece of metal, but from the rear of the car.  
So, knowing this was a bad noise I stopped and pulled over again.  Well, 
I looked around 
and saw no problem so I got back in and pulled on the road.  1st gear 
was OK, 2nd OK, 3rd OK, 4th... sounded like trying to run it with the 
clutch out and grinding 
the gears on purpose.  So, as I was about 100 miles away from refuge I 
limped 'home' at 35mph and noticed a high whine that wasn't there 
before.  The situation got 
worse and by the time I got back the noises were getting worse ( whine 
to small grind at times) and, at the very end, 3rd started to seize up 
too. 
 

So anyone have any ideas on what the problem is?  I know I will need a 
new tranny but I just like to be informed. 

Background,  I had been told for a while that I had a noisy bearing in 
the tranny (but which one I don;t know) and it did seem quitier after 
this crack. (except for the 
whine but still).  Item 2, the previous 3 days I had travelled about 
2000 miles including about 800 miles the day before at 70 MPH. 
Item 3 :  I had recently changed the fluid, put in an additive. (Fluid 
level was ok after noise too) 

Item 4: I did this because it was not wanting to go into gear at times. 

Item 5: Turned out I was an idiot because item 4 was horribly adjusted 
clutch that I can't forgive myself for not noticing. (ie right to the 
floor to engage and I wonder 
why I have problems shifting, argh) 

I gues I'm looking for two things. 1) what happened and should it have 
happened that suddenly. I thought that this bearing would start to make 
more noise befiore it 
went, thats why I didn't get it fixed before this )would be) 11,000 mile 
trip. 

Seemed like a good idea at the time. 

2) can anybody recomend a place to get a new tranny for a '76 bus, and 
the price. I'm in Canada (Toronto) so any supplier up here would be 
good. I really don't 
really know the area, though I'll soon be looking into who's around. 
 

Thanks, 

Graham Facer
