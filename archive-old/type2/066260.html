Subject: request for advice:  should I keep the Jetta too?

This message is sort of type2 related, but feel free to skip along if you 
don't feel like listening to me ramble...

I have a question to put to you as fellow bus owners.  I currently own 
two vehicles:  Spike, my '74 Bus and Meuller (can't type the umlaut), my 
'90 Jetta.  (Actually my Mom's former '90 Jetta that I recently finished 
paying for).  I just moved from NH (where insurance is not required, and 
hence is fairly cheap) to NY (where insurance *is* required, and is quite 
expensive).  In NH, I could have added the second car to my insurance for 
a fairly minimal amount.  I don't think that's the case here.  I think 
you're beginning to see where this is leading:  I can't afford to insure 
two cars.

Here are the specifics:

Spike:  '74 Bus, 114k mi, orig. engine, runs great, minor rust.
Plus:  I think I can rely on it.  Easy to fix when things go wrong.
Minus:  As old as I am.  Has a bit of rust.  Parts can be tough to find.

Meuller:  '90 Jetta, 130k mi., auto (yuck!), good cond. overall
Plus:  Has been pretty reliable.  I'm kinda attached to it.
       Unlike Bus, can be driven somewhat aggressively on occasion.
Minus: Parts are #*_at_*! expensive!  Has had starter problems.  Will
       probably begin to deteriorate from non-use since I'm driving 
       the bus almost exclusively.

I guess I'm basically looking for a little input on the experiences y'all 
have had relying on your bus as a daily driver.  Right now I commute 
about 3 miles to work.  If all goes well, by the end of the month my job 
will be across the street from my house and I'll only need to drive if I 
have to go off-site.  If that doesn't pan out, I may end up commuting 
again.  (I may end unemployed too, but that's another problem entirely...)

Well, waddya think?  Writing this down has helped me think it through a 
bit better, but I'm interested in hearing from people who have been/are 
in the same situation.

 - Tom
(Oh, if I didn't make it 100% clear, getting rid of the bus is *not* an 
option. :) )
