Subject: Back on the list, but now we have twins
Mime-Version: 1.0

We dropped off the list back in June before we headed out on
a 3 week road trip from Atlanta to New Hampshire and back in
our '72 Bus, bedecked with magnetic daisies.  The bus has been
in daily service since then and never gave us any problems 
so I never had a major incentive to get back on the list,
although I've been reading it from the web page.

But, this past weekend we swapped our '80 Rabbit diesel pickup
for another '72 Bus!  The 'new' bus doesn't run, but it did
a month or so ago.  It was a gamble, but we'll see.  Anyway, I 
checked the ID plate and it turns out it was made 5 days after
the other '72 Bus we have!  Our blue one was made on May 2, 1972
and this new one was made on May 6, 1972.

The new bus has headrests on the middle bench (2 seater), insulation on the
walls and a clock in the dash.  Our blue bus
has none of these.  I still have a few other small projects to complete
before I can play with the new bus, but hopefully I can get to it fairly soon.
