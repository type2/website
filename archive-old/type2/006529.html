Actually, it varies from company to company and there's little consistency.

Agents contracted to/employed by a single company, like Allstate, State
Farm, etc. have to work within the confines of that company's underwriting
rules and policies.  There is little, if any, flexibility or discretion at
the agent level as to how a vehicle is categorized and insured.

If you want to insure your bus/camper/transporter in a certain class or
category your best bet is to work with an insurance broker that specializes
in automotive/vehicular coverage.  The broker can place your coverage by
shopping it around to several different companies and find one that offers
what you need/want at a rate that's acceptable to you.  In theory, an
independent insurance broker works for you rather than for an insurance
company.

&gt;&gt;  ...my Allstate Agent tells me that the Insurance Industry considers the
Westy a station wagon, not a &quot;Temporary Dwelling, &quot; or an RV of any kind.
Guess it varys from state to state.  &lt;&lt;
