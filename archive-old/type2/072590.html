Subject: I don't remember seeing that there

Sorry for the less than informative title, but that describes my thoughts
as I walked out to get the paper the other morning.  Lying on the driveway,
in the 2 foot gap between my '71 Westy and my wife's new Honda, was the
sliding door.   By some miracle, it arrived there without gouging the
Honda.

In retrospect, I recall hearing a sound in my sleep that night and thinking
through the haze that another big limb must have fallen.

That door was one of the (few) joys of my very rusted bus.  Until last
week, it opened and closed with the touch of a finger.  Then last week, it
required an effort to do so. The evening of the incident, I had pulled it
back and forth several times and made a mental note to get around to it one
of these days.  That day is now.

Engines, not body work, are my thing.  I hate to say it, but I don't have a
lot of interest in unraveling the mechanisms that control that door.  I'd
like to replace them and move on. There is exactly one vw junk yard in my
area and I know they have no '71 busses.

So my questions are:
1. What years other than '71 share the upper and lower roller assemblies
and the sliding mechanism?
2. Are these available from our usual suppliers?

Thanks, Jack
