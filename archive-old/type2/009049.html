&gt; I seem to have run into a stumbling block on readying my '72 westy for
&gt; this years camping.  The 2 1/4&quot; fuel filler neck is no longer
&gt; obtainable  from VW.  I searched the archives and found mention of it
&gt; several times yet havn't seen a replacment or alternative solution. 
&gt; Since its hard to inspect the 90' bend area next to the tank i'm leary
&gt; of using standard straight Gates hose with a 90' elbow of some type
&gt; although thats about the only solution other than going strait and
&gt; cuttin a hole on the body for a new gas cap fitting.  Has anyone
&gt; retrofitted or otherwise found a solution for this problem?

The best solution seems to be to make up a metal filler pipe and then
to mount it using short lengths of the Gates hose.  A muffler shop can
supply bent lengths of tubing and if their bends aren't sharp enough
you can simply cut the tubing at an angle and then braze the two
pieces together to form a &quot;sharp&quot; angle.  The idea is to get about a
1/2 inch gap at either end of the new filler pipe and then to use
about 3 inch lengths of hose and hose clamps to attach the new filler
pipe at each end.  These connections don't have to be inspected all
that often, as they are normally not under pressure or even under the
fuel level.  The Gates hose is thick and tough and should last for a
decade or more.
