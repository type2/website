    I searched the Library and the Archive and I only found 5 Matches which
didn't cover what I need (Timing). I've got an AS-41 Mexican Engine and I
can’t find much out about them. All I have found is that because of the
difference in the metal content there supposedly better for building large
engines out of. Other than that nothing. If any one has some spare time or
knowledge would you please fill me in or help me find more out about these
engines. Timing, Differences, anything. There is no engine numbers stamped
anywhere on the block. Believe me I've cheeked. On the sump it says AS-41
and has the VW part number and MEXICO.
Thanks in advance to all.
