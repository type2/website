&gt;OK, so this may seem a totally lame question! My excuse is that I am new
to vehicle mechanics and to the wonders of the T2. Is their a specific
type/grade and manufactureer of plug that anyone would care to recommend? 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks alot.

Bosch Supers, standard coppers. Nothing else makes sence miles/dollar wise,
nor from the standpoint of proper function at all times for the T-II, any
year. NAPA sells them for 99 cents at least three times per year. Use the
grade shown in the Bosch book for your puppy.
