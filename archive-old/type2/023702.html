Subject: Westy stool and curtain swap?
Message-ID: &lt;65223fbe.2498957a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Greetings from under the Orange skies of SoCal---
	Attended the big VW jamboree thang last weekend, and spent most of my 
time in the swapmeet area getting parts for other people's older buses---is 
it just me, or is there virtually no late bay stuff for sale at these things? 
 I did get a new primered front bumper (probably Brazilian (how do you 
tell?)) for $24, but no rears available (the PO installed deluxe chrome ones 
on my '77 Westy).  
	I did happen to see a late Westy stool, but the owner said he 
couldn't sell it since his daughter was using it for a swapmeet chair!  He 
was a nice guy, though, and said to call him after the show, which I did, and 
I now have a stool.  It's not in particularly great shape, and it's not even 
correct for my model, but I always sort of wanted one, so what the heck.  I 
think that this came out of a '78 brown and white Deluxe---the plaid is sort 
of green and brown.  Anyway, when I get it home, inside is a pristine and I 
mean immac chocolate front accessory curtain (the one that covers the 
windshield and door glass).  My bus is chrome yellow with the 
green/orange/yellow plaid and mustard curtains.  I've been trying for months 
with no luck to find the original type of material to make a new set of 
curtains, and lately I've been looking for a good set of accessory curtains 
in my color that I might re-cut.  I'm posting on the WAY long shot that 
someone might have a nice set in my color that they might want to swap for 
the chocolate one.  Ditto for the stool, although I do have some extra plaid 
I got from Ron in my color that I can recover it with.  If no one has 
anything to swap, the curtain is most definitely for sale cheep.

Thanks!  Matt Q.  Laguna Beach, CA
