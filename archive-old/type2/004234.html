Hi Volks,
I can't seem to finish the brake job from he**.  70 bus, stock drums.  I
have replaced all wheel cylinders, shoes, rear drums, rubber hoses and
finally the master cylinder.  I have bled the system more times than I can
count, on my 4th quart of DOT3.  I've tried all the methods of bleeding from
all the manuals and tried a few tricks from the archives.  The pedal still
goes to the floor, but a couple quick pumps and it gets good and firm, up
where it should be. This means air in the system, right? The fluid comes out
clean, no bubbles.  I adjusted all the shoes, tight minus 3 or so clicks.  I
see no evidence of fluid leak. Am I missing something?  I wonder if the only
way to rectify this is a pressure bleed.
I also want to thank Steve Dolan, Ken Hooper and the rest of the List
Administrators.  You handle this diverse bunch of bussers perfectly.
