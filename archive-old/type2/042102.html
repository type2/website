Subject: HELP!!! Ignition Key Lost!!

Hi Volks,

in an act of overwhelming ineptitude, I have lost the only key to the
Über-Kamper's ignition. &quot;Luckily&quot;, it is safe at home in the driveway at the
moment, and all of the exterior locks have been swapped with the handles
from my 73 westy, which I have a spare key for. The truck is secure, but
immobile.

It's a 79 Transporter. I also have the ignition switch from the 73, but I
can't seem to get it out of the housing (which was removed with a hacksaw.)

I've looked over the archives and checked out the lock FAQ, but I don't know
where to find a take-apart diagram, and I have no Bentleys handy. The local
locksmith wants $150 to re-key the  lock, but I'd rather have it keyed to
the 73 ignition if possible.

Suggestions are VERY WELCOME! I have another car, so it's a non-emergency
status at the moment.

Thanks
