Subject: Boston Bob dyno updates.......

------=_NextPart_001_0005_01C19376.7BF36FE0



Bob asked me to pass this on.
I chassis dyno tested the big valve engine I had built, to promote the in=
crease in power it makes. But as of yet the I have not been able to make =
the engine produce the power I am sure it is capable of due to a lean run=
ning condition. I have learned allot along the way and will retest once t=
he engine is sorted out =20
     I had briefly hooked the tail pipe to a exhaust gas analyzer and the=
 engine was running a little lean I thought the converter was doing a gre=
at job and knew when the engine had a few more miles on it I would need t=
o go back and fine tune it and I left it at that. =20
    When It came time to chassis dyno test on 12/19/01 the air fuel ratio=
 meter on the dyno went from lean to very lean (air fuel ratio 15.00 ) as=
 the engine warmed the engine leaned out (air fuel ratio 17.00 ) (I think=
 13.5 is Ideal) and the power dropped  almost 25 % at 3000 rpm ( 9 hp)  5=
0.68 first run verses 41.73 warmed up. At 3500 rpm the difference was 61.=
19 hp verses 53.84 hp warmed up. At 4000 rpm 4500 rpm first run 77.07 hp =
verses 70.23 hp warmed =20
I also tested my almost stock 2.1 1984 plan Jane 7 passenger van (blue be=
ll)  with 40 k on the engine as a stock engine base line with an air fuel=
 ratio of 13.5 it made 55 hp at 3000 rpm 62.84 hp at 3500 rpm 69.86 hp at=
 4000 rpm and 73.89 at 4500 prm =20
  =20
what's new
I have braved the cold this past week and looked over the fuel injection =
system in my 84 camper with the big valve engine. As I previously reporte=
d I inspected each sensor and every wire as I installed the engine and al=
l of its components. I carefully cleaned and installed the ground wires o=
n the drivers side head and I would have replaced the connectors if I had=
 thought they looked at all like they had a problem. (can you see where I=
 am going with this) I did the pin test in the Bentley book page # 24.20 =
as recommended by Greg at Greg's repair and I found that the ground wire =
from the NTC coolant sensor was not grounded to the head causing the engi=
ne to run lean I hope. the connection looked great the terminal it was ni=
ce and clean and I could see there the wire was neatly crimped but it was=
 as if the terminal was not even touching the bare wire. Once the new ter=
minal was crimped and in place and retested I took the van for a drive an=
d the seat of my pants impression ( that by the way has been wrong consis=
tently ) was that the engine has more power after warm up and less thrott=
le is needed as I go threw the gears. I will now check the mixture and re=
port back ASAP

  I'm sharing my learning curve with the list to point out a couple of th=
ings. First I am sure the engines with poor connections and the lean sett=
ings is not that uncommon!!!!!!!!!! Pin test pin test pin test. Second  m=
y mileage has been in the 15 16 and 17 mpgs on the highway and with the p=
roper air fuel ratio and the increase in hp that goes with it I would thi=
nk my mileage will increase. The reason would be less pedal for the same =
amount of work and lastly the engine has a better chance of staying toget=
her longer because the chance of abnormal combustion from the lean condit=
ion hopefully has gone way down. Can you imagine how long an air-cooled v=
an would last if the engine was left this lean with the higher head temps=
. can you say melted piston.
    =20
stay tuned pun intended =20
