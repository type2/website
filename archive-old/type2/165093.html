Subject: 411 Engine dissection... 0,27,125,100

Greg,
        Based on your compression figs, 0,27,125,100,  I wonder about the 
piston ring diagnosis.  Of course something could have gone wrong in one 
cylinder, but then you would probably see scoring on the piston wall [since you 
say there is no burned crown].  Why do you say, &quot;A leakdown test indicated the 
valves were good...&quot;??  Before you commit to rings, why not pull the valves and 
examine their contact area with respect to their seats?

Good luck!
Glenn

========== REF ==============
Tonight I put on some gloves to keep my fingers clean (I have a job  
interview tomorrow afternoon; wish me luck) and set into pulling the  
1-2 head off the engine that failed on me back on Thursday. We did a  
compression check on this engine and got 0,27,125,100.  A leakdown  
test indicated the valves were good, and the rings were the culprit.  
(or a holed piston, but luckily that was not the case).

I can't say I've ever seen a cylinder head as clean inside as the one  
I removed.  But then again I haven't pulled engines with only 1000  
miles on them before.
