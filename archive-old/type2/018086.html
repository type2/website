&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Matt Callahan and i recentl pursached a 1969 camper from ohio
&gt; about a month ago.  It was towed on a trailer back here with me in
&gt; Rochester, NY and will be here until it is running before i drive it with
&gt; me to Massachusetts.  However i have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; The Relay Lever shaft through the front axle beam is gone.  it is so worn
&gt; out that the shaft rocks back and forth when you try to turn the wheel so
&gt; therefore the front tires do not turn until you have already turned the
&gt; steering wheel at least a ahlf turn or more.
&gt; 
&gt; The axle has been removed as of this afternoon.  my question is, is there a
&gt; way to rebuild this shaft as it seemed to have been done by the previous
&gt; owner.  OR is there someone in this area that can sell me a complete front
&gt; axle beam assembly so i can do a quick swap and get this show on the road
&gt; as i return home to MA from college this coming weekend or next week?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt; Matt
Matt:
If replacing the entire axle beam assembly, bear in mind that only 68-69
will fit. 70 and later have much larger flanges and will not fit.
If you're just talking about the moving parts being worn out, this is a
normal repair item, comes in a kit and includes the pin and bushings and
seals. The whole bracket will eventually rust out and it may be
necessary to take it to a welding shop andhave it rebuilt. Good axle
beams are available from junkyards in AZ,CA,NM,TX, and so on. I paid
about $150 delivered in about 1991 for one from Phoenix (can't remember
the name _____ Brothers Salvage. Gave me excellent service, though.)
They'd be a little hard to find in the north.
