Where the heat exchanger sheet metal shroud connects to the engine cooling 
fan housing, there should be two miniature plates, each with two captive M6 
nuts, together with gaskets, to close off the gap.

The concertina hoses to connect the heat exchangers to the bodywork 
ductwork, no longer use asbestos linings, but ribbed rubber instead.
Why not fit the after market in-line booster fans instead, as found at 
Bluebird Customs, in Great Britain!
