Subject: Thermostat Question

I was under the bus (78' type IV 2.0) yesterday and poking around by the
thermostat when I noticed that my thermostat was rather squishy. I seem to
remember it being firm when I installed it. The bus was cold, sat all
night, there seems to be a little slack in the cable and I could squeeze
the thermostat together like an accordian. Should it be this squishy? Whats
the best procedure for testing one? Could this have any thing to do with my
230-250 degree oil temps when running at 70 on a warm day.

Thanks,
