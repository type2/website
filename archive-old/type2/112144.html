Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

&gt; darker tan color on top. Maybe the 77 was just
&gt; slightly different and in 78
&gt; they went full force in the 70's brown? No
&gt; intermittent wipers or anything,
&gt; but it is a Champagne edition with the chrome
&gt; bumpers. Hmmm.

Great! That's the kind of information I am looking
for! The VW-'literature' is not really clear on this
subject. Untill recently I didn't even know that these
buses were called 'Champagne Edition'. From the
M-codes list I know that there were two 'special sales
campaigns'. I also know that these cars have a special
colour.

Over here in the Netherlands there never was such a
thing as a 'special salescampaign' for the T2. And
with very few US-specs-T2's driving around in Europe
you might never see one of these special models on a
meeting.

Thanks to all of you that have responded so far!



yours,


Vincent
