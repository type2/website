ok i'm the one with the 009 dist and i need some bigtime advice. This is what
happened. This 70 bus is my first vw. In fact it is the only vw i have ever 
drove
or ridden in and i love it. So you can see how green i am. I bought this bus
two years ago and started driving it one year ago this month. I put in a 
rebuilt
engine and replaced everything on the engine as the bus had been stored for
19 years and i assumed everything was bad. The engine had a rod knocking.
The shop where i bought everything told me that the 009 dist was the best way 
to go. Probably didn't have a vac dist. I was very satisfied with what i have
until so many of you said the vac dist was better. I can't compair as i have
never driven another vw. I don't even know anyone with a vw. I still have the
vac adv dist. The bus had 71000 miles and i know that is right so the dist is
probably worth rebuilding only i don't know how. Mike said he would send
something on it and i would be greatful. So let me know if i'm missing some
thing by using this 009. sorry for the long list. I drive this bus every day.
Morris
