&gt; Don't think I'm defending harassing people because of their stickers,
&gt; because I think it's contemptible, but the fact is that if there is any
&gt; sticker in the entire universe that is going to be regarded as a flag,
&gt; it's one of those teddy bears, because of their provenance and their
&gt; metaphorical value...

Likewise, don't think of me as a militia-type person (because I most
definitely am not), but I do believe there ought to be a law that allows
us, as citizens of the United States, to express our opinions, however
much they may offend against the currently fashionable public opinion.
Indeed, if I was writing such a law, I would phrase it something like
this:

Amendment I
Congress shall make no law .... abridging the freedom of speech ....

I would probably follow it with a prohibition on using unpopular speach as
an excuse for conducting searches.  Maybe that would be phrased something
like this:

Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated

I don't know.... just call me a dreamer....
