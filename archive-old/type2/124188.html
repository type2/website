Subject: re: listees

I agree that the bays are the daily drivers now, whereas the splitties are the
simpler, easier to fix, less driven machines. It just makes more sense that
there will be more questions from the baywindow crowd.
I also agree with Old Volks Ronnie in that there are a lot of lurkers on the
list. I'm one. I read and read, and I pmail most of my responses. I do that to
try to respect other listee's very full Inboxes.
I don't enjoy some getting flamed for the same old questions, but I do enjoy
reading from the new unfamiliar names as well as from the wise old listees.
