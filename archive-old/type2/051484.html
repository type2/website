Subject: [T2] Exploring posibilities

		AS you know I have been looking for a Vanagon or late 70's
Westy so my family and I could go camping. After a long weekend of talking
with my wife we have come to the conclusion that VW just did not make a
camper that she would feel comfortable camping in with 3 kids and 2 dogs. 
		I also had a small Jap truck, it is in need of a few things
and it does not seat all of our family. If we decide to go with a pop-top
tent trailer I would need to get a new truck. I hate not having a Bus, but I
also need a truck, a work truck. We have 1.2 acres and they always need
something. 
		There has been a lot of talk about towing with a Bus and I
am wanting a little feed back on an idea. If I were to find a Double Cab VW
Bus, then get (or Rent) and pop-top trailer I could still drive a Bus, seat
all three Kids, and make my wife happy and still go camping. 
		This is still not the perfect solution, but so far the best
of any I have had. 
		So, am I crazy, would this work. I figure a 68-71 Double
Cab, or a Vanagon DC would work. I would love to find a 72-79 DC, but they
are rare in the USA(never imported by VW). If this is the way I go, I will
be looking for a solid, but not perfect DC. It will still see use hauling VW
parts, wood, gravel and other home improvement items. It would also delete 1
vehicle from the shop. I could have a Bus and a truck in just one DC.
(currently have a Truck and a Westy)
		Anyway, feedback would be good, I am wanting to do the best
thing for my family. 
		P.S. Could I still camp with the West Westies if I tow a
trailer with a DC?
