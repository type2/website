&gt; Okay, I found the right person to do the bodywork on my rusty 1969 bus.
&gt; I'm getting ready to purchase the following parts:
&gt;
&gt; Pas side rear corner and battery tray
&gt; Rear wheel arches
&gt; Rocker panels
&gt; Inner door steps
&gt; Front floor panel
&gt;
&gt; Who makes the best fitting replacement parts?

best fit, and best price find a donor bus with good pieces same year and
model (westy, deluxe etc)

&gt; For the pas rear corner, should I have a used one cut from a donor? I
&gt; seen larger, more complicated replacement pieces simply not fit well.

good used from a place like BustedBus or spend the $$ for new parts

Bus Depot has most if not all of the pieces you need. as you said he
doesn't make em only sells em and the fit can be hit or miss.

let us know where you got which and how they fit

Bob
