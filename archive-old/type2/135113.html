Subject: Coil connection block

I have a lot of connections going to my coil -- tachometer, dual 
battery switch, along with all of the stock connections (FI, etc.). I 
was thinking about mounting a remote connection block, probably on the 
reinforcement just inside the hatch, so that I can route just one wire 
(or at most three) to each side of the coil.

What I don't know is where to get a generic connector block. I want to 
use standard connectors; I don't want to make connections with screws.

Anyone know of a good aftermarket source of automotive electrical parts 
like this? Or know of some model/make/year of car (before 1990) that 
has something like this and could serve as a donor (from the junkyard, 
not from someone's driveway while they are on vacation)?
