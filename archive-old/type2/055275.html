&gt; Just an FYI, an old friend of mine had a 68 westy he bought off a couple
&gt; in northern Michigan, which the couple may have bought new in Canada. It
&gt; had a full size rectagular pop-top which popped straight up, with no hammock,
&gt; but with a panel which slid out and slept 2 upstairs.

That's not a Westfalia, it's a Riviera. Same basic thing, except that the
Westfalia conversion was done in Germany and the Riviera one was done in
Oregon.
