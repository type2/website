Subject: Re: [T2] stripped stud

First goto www.timesert_dot_com ... then get the insert
you need.... I think its a M7 or M8 stud... not
sure... find what size it is before ya order.... then
just drill the head with the right bit, thread it, and
insert the time sert (with loctite)... your ready for
the intake... I wouldnt use a helicoil, there not to
good of a design... and you cant loctite them in
place... it only &quot;locks&quot; in a airtight environment,
the helicoil is really a SS &quot;spring&quot; if you will....
if you use LT on it, it wont cure till you install the
new stud.... then next time you have to pull that
stud, for whatever reason, itll most likely pull the
HC with it...
 Just a note.... when you buy LT, the bottle will only
be half full or so.... thats how it comes.... if they
filled the bottle to the top (no air, just liquid) it
would cure in the bottle....
 Hope this helps... its a pretty easy fix...

&gt; Any ideas?
