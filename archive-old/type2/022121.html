Subject: Houston Welding
Mime-Version: 1.0

OK,
Maizey the MoneyBus needs some welding,
and although I very much wanting to try it myself so as to learn, and
have the sense of accomplishment at the finishing of the project,
maybe it might be just as well to look for a local outfit to do this
job, if I can make sure it is done right as to cost and quality.

I have the pre-fabricated pieces to weld in behind both front wheels,
and the bottom side panels, as well as a new battery tray.

Are there any Houston subscribers out there that have had good
experiences with local weld shops, or is there a Houston &quot;Elmer&quot; out
there that can hold my hand through the project?

Thanks for reading this post,
Bob
