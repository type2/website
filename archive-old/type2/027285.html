I own a 76' Westy and am looking into ordering racks for it soon.  Does 
anybody know for sure if the Yakima 1A Raingutter towers w/ the HiRise 
extension will fit over the fiberglass top when mounting the feet to the 
raingutter and not the pop-top?  I do not want to mount them on the pop-top. 
  I know that Thule has a system that will work like this, but would really 
prefer Yakima as I've owned Thule's before and did not care for the crossbar 
strength.  Thank you for any help.
