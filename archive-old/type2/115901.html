  troubleshooting

&gt; The only other major new items that I replaced were all the mechanical
&gt; lifters with hydraulic lifters - to include new pushrods.  I ended up
&gt; making my own pushrods and did my best to get them all the same length
&gt; per the hydraulic length spec.

christopher,

forget about vacuum leaks or mixture adjustments for the time being. this is
not a tuning problem that you have, i will bet money on it. it is almost
definitely a valve train issue.

on what or whose advice did you make this change to hydraulic lifters? i am
guessing that you did not split the case and also replace the cam.

i am very concerned about putting a new set of hydraulic lifters on an old
cam. this is not a good combo. unless the old lifters are completely worn
out, it may be better to use them along with getting some good used solid
lifter pushrods (easy and cheap to get) to replace the damaged ones.

i am using my spider senses to figure that you thought you broke the engine
in the first place with a bad valve adjustment, so you figured you would
eliminate future valve adjustments by swapping in some hydraulic lifters.

proceed very carefully, because you may be getting yourself into a pickle
with this combo you have, the cam may now wear very quickly and take the new
lifters with it. 

my 3 cents.
