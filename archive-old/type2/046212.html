Subject: What Gauge to use

To monitor my new engine. I had a oil temp gauge on my 71. I was going to
order one for my 79 and then talked with a few local shops and they leaned
more toward cylinder head temp and oil pressure. Any opinions out there???
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
