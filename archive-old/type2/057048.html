Well, folks, all good things must come to an end. Today I sold the Frosted
Pumpkin, my 1972 Bus. Lack of time was preventing me from really having any
meaningful interaction with the Pumpkin (it was more toy than
transportation), and so I found the Pumpkin a new owner, a young man from
East Texas who will take care of it, make a few mistakes here and there (I
made some good ones), and give it a great home.

Take me off the stats, Unca Joel, and I'll be sigining off, too. Thanks to
all of you for your help over the past two years. Josh, we need to talk
about you taking over the Bull Bars web pages, as well as How Not to Burn,
that info needs to live on. I'll still be stopping for ailing busses on the
highway, so maybe I'll see one of you down the road.
