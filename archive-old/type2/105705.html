Subject: Magical Self adjusting timing - dizzy problem

71 Westy, 1600 DP, Stock dual Vac dizzy.
I posted a couple of days ago about my timing getting
skewed. So then I checked dwell, it was at 60 (a month
earlier I had set it at 50). Two days ago I
re-adjusted timing and drove until today. Rechecked
timing today, it's off again. Re-check dwell today, it
has now gone from 60 to 75.  In trying t0 re-adjust
the dwell I discovered that the threads on the dizzy
advance plate where the points screw secures the
points is getting stripped allowing my points to be
moved open further and further, and dis-allowing them
to be tightened enough.  So how do I fix this? Can
this plate be replaced by itself? Do I need an entire
new dizzy? (I hope not, it took me nearly 2 years to
find the correct 205Q dizzy for my 71)? Looks like I
am going to have to go back to my spare 009 until I
get it worked out :-(  Any suggestions for me??
