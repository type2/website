Should have clarified. I'd give it a healthy dollop, not not fifty pounds.
It was probably closer to 1 cup TSP to 1 gallon of water.

&gt; This seems to be the way to go if you need heavy cleaning, but doesn't it
&gt; take the paint off completely?
&gt;
&gt; Which leads us to the question, how do you paint the interior of the fan
&gt; shroud?  I'd hate to have a nice shiny part rusting from the inside!!
&gt;

I did this with my engine and all the tin.  It does wonders for removing all
the
caked on oily gunk.  It also will remove the paint and you are left with
bare
metal, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I went to clean my license
plates
and didn't think about the paint removal aspect and it was the strangest
thing to
pull two bare metal plates out of the soup.

As for painting inside the fan shroud, a wide dispersal painting device
(rattle
can) can mist in paint in most of the cracks and crevices.  I don't think
that the
air will mind looking at the few runs that might develop using this method.

About the 50 pound bag..  I don't know if Ian dumped the whole bag in there
at
once, but I have found the stuff to go quite far on small amounts.
Typically, I
use about a cup of TSP to 3 gallons of water.
