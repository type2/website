Subject: Re: '76 Bus starts, then dies

It may be as simple as a disconnected vacuum hose. Check the hoses first. If
that doesn't help, the HTML FI troubleshooter on my website may be of
assistance (it will help you check other things, such as ignition, first).

&gt; home.  It runs great (usually) but yesterday after a short trip to town it
&gt; now only starts and runs for a couple of seconds then it dies.
