Kevin:
That could be a key piece of information. The alternator lite must be working
for the regulator to control the alternator correctly. It sounds to me like
you've maybe got a ground wire loose under the dash someplace. They are brown
and there should be several fastened to a 4-way ground lug welded onto a place
near the fuse panel. Make sure none are hanging loose.
