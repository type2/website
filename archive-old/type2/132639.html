Subject: Re: [T2] Gasoline coming out of tailpipe

CHeck that your Float isn't stuck in the carb. This could be one 
culprit. If the Float doesn't stop the flow of fuel into the carb I 
would imagine it would just keep'a'coming and this could be a symptom 
when the pump starts pumping.

Just a thought. This happened on my '65 Moped when I rebuilt it, never 
had it happen on my bus so it is a bit of a shot.
