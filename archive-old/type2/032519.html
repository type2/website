What type of wire are you using?I use 1/4 inch braded nylon rope and
liquid
dishsoap.It definately helps to have someone apply pressure to the area
the

  Frank, the books I've read say &lt;caps&gt; dont't use washing up liquid &lt;/caps&gt;(liquid dishsoap) as it contains salt and will eat your window rubbers. I use general purpose lithium grease (just a smear). Those damn side windows are still a nightmare to fit. When we did the sliding door glass, I had Diane standing on it to stop it popping back out again!!
