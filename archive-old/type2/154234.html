Subject: Dorper Top Woes

So ... I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to hold the Dorper Top
down on my 60. Originally it used a small bracket fastened to the top -
fastened to that bracket was a turn buckle. The turn buckle then, I think,
fastened on to another bracket that was screwed to the fibreglass thing that
attached to the roof. I wanted to used the rubber westy things to hold this
top down but I don't think it is going to work smoothly .. so it looks like
I'll be going with the turn buckle things ... so ... when I took the most
recent Dorper top off of a bus it had the hardware plus a leather strap .. I
can't figure out what the leather strap was for ... anyone know?

Anyone have pictures of a Dorper top installed on a bus ...

For those who don't know ... Dorpers were a Canadian conversion company out of
B.C.
