Ah stick to your guns Jerry. You just can't keep em all happy. Remember the
5-90-5 rule 5% will love you,90% are normal and 5% aren't worth the effort
to scrap em off your shoes. I would think if their useing a sunbrella
product,it would be lighter but stronger. I mean they only use it for
complete canvas on boats.

&gt; Just to answer a lot of questions--Dawn, of Phoenix is NOT making this
&gt; product. If you have any complaints about Dawn--Please do not send them to
&gt; me--The people producing the canvas for my 1960DC, may have a point about
&gt; dealing with some VW people--Since I posted this--Now I'm getting e-mail
&gt; blasting me,and other VW People. I felt really good about finding a deal
on
&gt; a canvas for my DC and passing it on to others--Now I have my doubts about
&gt; trying to help--
