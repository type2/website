&gt; In the air tube from the AFM to the air plenum I

Nope.  Probably not.  The crankcase ventilation hose feeds directly into
that tube.  It's the hose that runs to the box in the rear center of the
engine.  If you are getting substantial blow-by thru the rings/valves,
that feeds a lot of oil up into the intake stream.  I see that tube really
oily all the time, so I would not be *really* concerned, but it may be
time to take the engine to a mechanic who can do a &quot;leak down&quot; test on it
once you have it back together.  This will tell you the condition of your
rings.

&gt; I haven't gotten into a dissection of the AFM yet, but was wondering
&gt; if it could be cleaned of oily deposits if any are found and what
&gt; solvent would be best for this application.  Also, the plenium will
&gt; probably have its fair share of oil.  Would this affect opperation??
&gt; Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome.

Well, the AFM is probably fine, unless you have been doing a lot of back
firing.  The AFM is upstream of the injection point for that oily gunk.
If you do have a lot of oil in the AFM, that's a separate problem.  If it
were me (and I've never done it, but what I would do...) I would use WD-40
as a cleaner.  It's kerosene by and large, and should not hurt the
electrical parts while loosening the oil.

&gt;     I also need some push on terminals to replace the worn
&gt; out/corroded beyond recongition ones I pulled off yesterday.  They fit
&gt; on the side marker lights and are a small size.  Maybe some vendor
&gt; knows what I'm talking about.

I am not a vendor, I do know what you are talking about, and they are a
genuine PITA to find! I know that they are a seldom-used standard size,
and that AMP would be happy to sell you a box of 1,000, but getting just 4
ain't easy.  I wound up getting mine in an appliance repair place that had
them for use in attaching a heating element to some toaster or other.
Radio Shack does *not* have them :-(  Try a ham radio place or appliance
repair shop.
