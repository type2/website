&gt; Also while doing the valves today I noticed that the retaining spring on the
&gt; rocker arm assembly on cylinders 1 &amp; 2 is not clamped down at the #1 intake
&gt; rocker. It's just kind of hanging out. It is clamped near the other rockers
&gt; on that side and near all the rockers on the 3&amp;4 side. Is this a potential
&gt; problem? Would it be a huge project to undo the rocker and try to secure it?

If this spring is not clamped down properly or misaligned it can rub against
the pushrods.  I found when I tore down my engine that 3 of the pushrods had
been rubbing like this - one was almost worn through. :-O  It looked like
someone had put it in a lathe and turned it down.  Look for a polished band
about 1/4&quot; wide.

It's very easy to loosen the rocker assembly and push the spring into place,
provided it isn't bent up.  Recheck your clearances afterwards to make sure
nothing is awry.
