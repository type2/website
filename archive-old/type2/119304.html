Subject: door seals

I hope I'm not starting a FART.  I've done a lot of reading in the
archives, but don't have the answer I'm looking for.

Okay.  Door seal nightmare.  I can't decide if the ones I have are
Brazilian or German.  If I go by the numbers on Bus Depot's web site
they are Brazilian.  If I cross reference to the numbers on WCM site, I
can distinguish between German and Brazilian.

Anywho...these suck.  They are too long, too fat and are not at all
like OG stuff which is still on my '69 and my '68 parts bus.  I
couldn't get the set off the parts bus in a manner I felt would allow
them to be put on the DC.  Greg Potts mentioned something about
modifying his with a razor blade in a post to the T2 list.  I'm not
sure I have enough patience for that maneuver...especially if the
number one helper is on duty. (grin)

Anyone have experience with the German set Ron at Bus Depot sells?  I
know they are also not like the OG stuff, but if they fit better than
what I have I'm okay with spending the $60 per door.

I also noticed Ronnie has some from WCM for about three times the
price.  Does anyone know if they are like OG?

Anyone have any other thoughts?

Thanks,
mjr
