&gt; Subject: What type of OIL, question?!
&gt;
&gt; For a BUS motor that has less than 1,000 miles, WHAT weight oil do you
&gt; suggest I use?

I remember not long ago someone on the list suggested that our Busses are essentially SUVs. Well, over the weekend I saw a commercial, I think from Pennsoil, for their new SUV oil. The only logical reason I can think of is that SUV drivers are always out in the fast lane pushing their beast to the limit.
