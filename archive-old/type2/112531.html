Subject: Worm&amp;Roller Gearbox?

When I had my bus dipped there was one part I could not get off before I hauled 
it to the facility that did the job for me. Needless to say my steering gearbox 
looks like it was buried for a thousand years, on Mars. All of the manuals I 
have consulted say the worm and roller is a part that is relplaced only. Does 
anybody on the list have any experience attempting to repair/restore one of 
these gearboxes or should I just hang it up and accept the fact that I will 
have to fork over the $$$$ for a used or rebuilt one.
