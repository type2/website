Subject: Re: [T2] Tale of Joy and Choke Question!

Hey  You need to tell everyone the year of your bus and the type of carb
setup you have. For example my carb is a single weber with electric choke,
so the problem could be electrical for me, but not for you.

Congrats on the heat!!

Subject: [T2] Tale of Joy and Choke Question!


&gt; Hiya Everyone
&gt;
&gt; I want to share my joy with some folks who may appreciate it (unlike
&gt; everyone else I have told, who just muttered &quot;big deal&quot;).
&gt;
&gt; I decided today I was going to find out what the knob below the driver's
&gt; seat was for.  Although I knew it was heat related, it's actual purpose
has
&gt; had me beat since I bought my camper almost a year ago.
&gt;
&gt; The knob was too stiff to move at first, but after spraying with WD40,
till
&gt; I thought the smell would kill me, I got it free.  While my daughter
pushed
&gt; it in and out (each move accompanied by the whine &quot;Can I go back in now
it's
&gt; cold?&quot;), I got under the bus to see what it did.
&gt;
&gt; It turns out, the cable was still there, (and working - just about), and
it
&gt; joined to the centre heating channel.  From this, there is a black
&gt; flexi-pipe going somewhere into the camper..  So where the hell did this
go,
&gt; I wondered?  I followed a straight line from the pipe out from under the
&gt; side and into the back of the camper.
&gt;
&gt; Imagine my joy, when I discovered a heater vent going side-to-side, from
the
&gt; driver's seat to the passenger seat, aiming towards the back.  It has been
&gt; hidden by the carpet all this time.
&gt;
&gt; Five minutes later the carpet is trimmed, the knob is pulled out as far as
&gt; it will go and I took it for a test run - YIPPEE - heat in the back.  Now
&gt; the kids won't freeze everytime we go out.  Okay, so it's VW heat - the
kids
&gt; will still freeze - but they might get away with a few less layers :-)
&gt;
&gt; Now onto my problem.  The automatic choke isn't going off all the way -
even
&gt; when the engine is warm - it is still staying on one notch.
&gt;
&gt; At the moment, I am just getting out after a few minutes and knocking it
off
&gt; manually, but I know it can be adjusted somehow on the side of the carb.
&gt; Trouble is, that is all I do know.  So, can anyone give me details of
&gt; exactly what I need to do or send me to a site that explains it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, and Merry Christmas to all
&gt;
&gt; Tammy
&gt;
