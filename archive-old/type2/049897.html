Good point. I do have the stock set up, upright with generator. I called IPD
to find out amperage/wattage draw from the kit. Unfortunately, they didn't
have one in stock so they couldn't tell me. They said the kit might work,
but this would definitely be something to consider before purchasing. I'll
have to call back or go there in a couple of weeks.
