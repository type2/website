Subject: Re: [T2] Starter solenoid problem

The bad news?  Yesterday..... lights came on, no
&gt; clickety-click.  Assuming it's solenoid again - have
&gt; not had a chance to look at it yet.
                                                    
sounds like you have a wiring problem, need to install
one of those hot start kits to bypass all the wiring.
