&lt;&lt; rear upper hatch:
I don't know but I believe that the shape of the rear hatch was stable
from 1968 to 1979.  I worry that the shape may have changed from 1971 to
1972 with the change in engine hatch shape. &gt;&gt;

I used a '71 on a '79, but the mounting holes and captive nuts for the
hinges are different...
