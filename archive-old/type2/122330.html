Subject: 091 nose cone

I'm having trouble locating part numbers for the 091 nose cone. ETKA has
co-mingled the 002 and 091 parts and other sources are primarily for the
002. I know several folks have rebuilt their 091 according to the archives
and I was hoping someone would share some part numbers with me.

This is what I've figured out:

hockey stick - 091 311 541
nose cone gasket  - 002 301 215A
shift ball joint  - 004 301 241A (steel ball is 241As)

This is what I'm confused on:

front seal ?
front bushing ?
inner bushing with balls ?

The last item appears to be a roller bearing of some kind. Here's the
diagram showing the two bushings and the seal:

Based on the price of the hockey stick alone, do people just purchase a
rebuilt 091 nose cone from a transmission rebuilder and send in theirs as a
core?
