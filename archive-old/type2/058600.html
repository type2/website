Subject: Lucas-VW coil

Hi folks,

I came across a 1600 DP bus engine sporting a Lucas ignition coil.  The coil
casing is aluminum and the flat end is stamped with a large VW symbol as
well as an &quot;043&quot; prefixed number that appears to be a Bosch part # (?).  The
plastic side of the coil has the Lucas name and in small print along its
rim, &quot;VW&quot; initials.  

I'm curious about the business relationship between Lucas and VW--I thought
that on all VWs sold worldwide, ignition components were made by Bosch.  Did
Lucas provide VW approved replacment coils for VWs in the UK, or was this a
stock, factory part in certain countries?  An archive search reveals a
mention of someone who had a Lucas coil on their VW, but VW markings on the
coil aren't mentioned.
