Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent zipper fixes?

My advise would be, if you would like the zipper's to be right, woud be
to take the tent to a boat canvas shop.

They stock all kinds and colors of heavy duty zipper's, and will install
them for you in a professional manner.

And the bonus is that at this time of year they are usually slow, as the
boating season is winding down, and they could probably knock the
zipper's out for you right away, and cut you a deal too. 

Later,
