my bus loves the climb.  i often find myself waking up in rocky mountain

after my climb and shoot I often drive back home the long way...over
trailridge road and down to winter park and over berthoud pass.  it's one  
of my favorite drives.  the bus does great and has no problem climbing
mostly in third gear with the occasional drops to second over the switch
backs.  the GWB may not handle it so well though.

if you do find yourself in RMNP you must make the climb up trailridge
road for sunset...no matter what vehicle you're in.  often you'll get
some cloud cover over the neversummer range and the glow from the setting
sun is amazing.
