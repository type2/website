&gt; Sean,

&gt; Sorry to post at the last minute in your decision making process.  Last year I
&gt; put 4 Cooper SRM II tires on my bus.  Load rating D, (1845 lb load), 8-ply,
&gt; etc.  185 14 size.  I'm happy with them, but they're definitely highway tread
&gt; tires.  I have not had any problems, but also haven't put that many miles on
&gt; them (maybe 3000).  I did notice a tremendous improvement over the too small
&gt; passenger tires I was using.  Nice stiff sidewalls and tall enough.  I think I
&gt; paid about $75 each, just over $320 for mounted/balanced, etc. (but no sales
&gt; tax here in MT...gotta love that - so remembe to add your state's X.X%).  I'd
&gt; say give 'em a look, the load rating and price are right.
&gt; 
&gt; If $$$ was no object, I'd probably put the Agilis on my bus, but I couldn't
&gt; justify an extra $30 per tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt;

Greetings, all!

We've had the Cooper SRMII's on our 76 Hightop (aftermarket) Westy for two
trips from Wisconsin to Yellowstone and back. The stability seems to be
good, and the ride is not harsh. We haven't gone off road, but in the wet
dirt/clay roads of the Black Hills they handled well (while making a mess of
the bus!). The stable ride is especially noticable descending the mountain
passes, including Powder River/Tensleep in the Bighorns in thick fog and
rain and Dead Indian north of Yellowstone in a June snow storm last year.

We don't put many miles on them other than camping, but they have about 6000
miles on them so far with no undue wear. I'd buy them again, based on my
experience with them so far. The price I paid was similar to that of Markus,
with the sales tax of Wisconsin added on.

YMMV,
