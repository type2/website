I post with anxiety.  As many know, my family and I are planning to move
to Boise, ID this Saturday.  Well, apparently not.  Yesterday the bus
broke down on me.  Seems I dropped yet another valve seat.  This time I
managed to make it good buddies with the cylinder.

So, I can either spend a few hundred or I can try and get another engine
or bus.  I live about 45 minutes East of Asheville, NC.  Is there anyone
that would happen to have an engine or bus that they would be willing to
get rid of for no more than 1 grand?  The engine needs to be in running
condition.  I am looking into getting my engine rebuilt also but want to
pursue all options.  Thank you for your help.
