Subject: New front brake discs/squeal

Hello Listers:

I just installed new front brake discs and pads on my '76 Campmobile.  I 
applied the anti-squeal goop on the backs of the pads.  I wiped the new 
brake discs as clean as possible (did not use a solvent) before 
installation.

I didn't experience any squeal the 1st day after installation.  Now I'm 
getting an ear shattering squeal when stopping in reverse and an 
intermittent squeal when forward braking.  Braking is otherwisde sure and 
solid.

Do I need to remove the pads and apply more goop?  Should I have cleaned the 
new discs with a solvent?  Will the pads seat themselves eventually?

The Bus is not my daily driver and does not receive high mileage usage.

I could not obtain an hit in the archive.  Perhaps I wasn't using the right 
key words; any help is appreciated.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
