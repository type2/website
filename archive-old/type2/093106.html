Subject: Re: [T2] if it ain't one thing...

Rebuild it yourself....

Get it apart and pull out the bearings and replace them. Any good parts 
house should be able to sell you the bearings if they are a standard size. 
Most have a large catalog that will cross reference sizes for their 
supplier's part#.

Chattanooga has one specialty bearing supplier called Dixie Bearing that 
I've used. NAPA for example can get bearings as can many of the lesser 
FLAPS (but be careful of quality problems).

Often rebuilders will use cheap bearings (or not replace them at all) like 
Chinese bearings which don't have alot of longevity built into them. If you 
bought a Ural Russian motorcycle you might find yourself replacing all of 
the bearings for the same reasons.   www.ural_dot_com

The only reason I would return a generator or alternator for a rebuilt one 
is if the windings went bad. Everything else can be done by a shadetree 
mechanic.

If in doubt take it someplace local and have them rebuild it and ask if you 
could watch. Very educational. I live in a town of 25K and we have about 
2-3 electrical component services.

If you've got to have one soon then find a local used one to use in the 
meantime.

Give it a try, I think you'll be very surprised what some of your time 
spent can save you in the repair.





&gt;After a couple weeks of a gradually increasing
&gt;whinning noise my generator light came on last night.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't had time to dig into it yet, but i'm
&gt;guessing Generator bearings are gone. (?)
&gt;
&gt;need some savvy: Should I get it rebuilt or buy a new
&gt;one?
&gt;
&gt;What bugs me is the generator is relatively new (two
&gt;years and about 20,000 miles).
