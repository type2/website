&gt; Hello Everyone--
&gt; 1980 Vanagon CA model. Just had the 3/4 cylinder
&gt; head replaced. When I
&gt; park backward in my fairly steep driveway, a lot of
&gt; oil appears to be
&gt; leaking from the area of the tin near the 3/4
&gt; cylinder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[...]Pull
your bottom air deflector from 3&amp;4 clean it good, run
it, park on the hill, look for the leak. If this does
not help, do a compression test, a piece of tin could
have gotten pinched between the head and cyl during
the head change. This could give you blowby which will
look like a oil leak. Good luck Phil
