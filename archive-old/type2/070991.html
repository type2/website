Hey fellow VW nuts,

I have a really simple question for most people that I just can't get...

Does anyone know where to spray starter luid in the engine if the bus won't
start?
I have a '78 standard Microbus with AFC fuel Injection if this helps.... I
called my mechanic and he said to &quot;just spray it in the black hose&quot; simple
enough huh.... 

Any help appreaciated, Thanks again.
