Subject: Re: [T2] Somewhat silly question..

Thanks for all your responses.  I just got too many replies to thank you all
personally.
The &quot;shortest&quot; bay available in the barn is just over 8 feet so I should be
fine regardless.
Thanks again all!

&gt; My 1973 camper is currently at the previous owners
&gt; house, a couple hundred
&gt; miles from me.  A friend of mine is offering a space
&gt; in his barn for me to
&gt; keep it closer/work on it/etc..
&gt; However, he needs to know the approximate height in
&gt; order to figure out
&gt; which &quot;bay&quot; of the barn to put it in.  Since I'm not
&gt; near my camper, and I
&gt; don't have my bentley, or any other manuals with
&gt; me..could someone give me
&gt; an approxmate measure of how tall a 73 camper is
&gt; (with the top closed)?
