Scott,
No it is not a typo.  It is a different type than what you are thinking of.
It is used in houses and RV's to detect CO.  There are all sorts of rules of
where and not to mount it and near an engine was definitely a place not to
place it.

&gt; 40F???  Could that be a typo?  CO detector = exhaust = HOT.  The air/fuel
ratio
&gt; detectors usually want to see temps around 600F and I could see a typo being
&quot;do
&gt; not mount anywhere the temp gets below 400 degrees F&quot;.  That is why you will
&gt; usually see the detectors mounted on the exhaust pipe, right after the
&gt; collectors.  Are we talking the same kind of detector here?
