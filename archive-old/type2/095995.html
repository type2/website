Subject: Getting cheaper every year



I swapped my 73 sun visors for some 71's this weekend.  The plastic had
cracked and they were no longer supported properly.  I was interested to
find that the '71 was made with metal instead of plastic- and makes me
realize that even from '71 to '73 cost cutting had already began to take
effect on things so little as the sun visor.  Almost 30 years later it is
precisely these cost-saving things that end up breaking!

Shawn
