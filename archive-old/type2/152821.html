Subject: Need Help in Redding, CA - Non-VW Emergency

Hello everyone,
I am in a kind of weird situation, I am here in Portland, OR and my mom is
in Redding, CA. She had to have her 91 Subaru worked on in an attempt to
pass smog. She has been hassled by this guy who is charging her an arm and a
leg to do unnecessary work (as so I believe). when she had him &quot;look&quot; at it,
to see what needed to be done, she comes back and he tells her her car is
all apart and that she has to pay him to do the work (estimated at $350-400
to replace the O2 sensor and EGR sensor) she didn't know what to do, and let
him do it. Then he comes back to her, saying that the EXHAUST manifold is
completely clogged, and he has to replace it (+ $125) then as he was running
it the timing belt &quot;broke&quot; and now he claims that the engine block is
cracked, and he &quot;fixed&quot; it. Then he said that the valves were also cracked
and broken and that he had to remove the head and resurface the head and
replace the valves.....this all started because she wanted to pass smog (to
trade a fellow her Subaru for his vanagon westy) &lt;---VW content! --

Keep in mind her car was running FINE when she left here last friday, a
slight oil leak, and a place where the muffler was hitting the body and
making noise, and could have used a valve adjustment if you were really
wanted to put money into it, but I really think he is using my mom for money
because she doesnt know much about cars (I taught her to check fluids, and
listen for weird noises). She has paid him $500 towards the $1000 he wants.
She is supposed to pick up the car today - and I told her to get a receipt
of everything that was done, and what his diagnosis was...but I was hoping
that someone in the Redding area *might* be able to go down with her and
make sure everything that he claims to have done is at least done...i.e.
look at the &quot;exhaust manifold&quot; make sure its new, look at the &quot;Crack&quot; in the
engine block - receipts for having the head resurfaced and valves done by a
machine shop - and obviously look at the engine to see if shows a little
cleanliness showing he even removed the head, and that kind of stuff.

Ugh - I am very frustrated, and usually wouldn't post something like this to
the list, but I have a really bad feeling that he is totally ripping my mom
off - and either saying that unnecessary work needs to be done, charging her
more than necessary....and I cant be down there to help her.

It reminds me of a joke I tell people when talking about cars - or want me
to diagnose their car &lt;jokingly&gt; &quot;....I bet your muffler bearing is out...&quot;

If you have time today and are in the area please give her a call at her
friends house:
530.241.4588
Her name is Araya (Ah-ray-Ah; think of a &quot;ray&quot; of light)
My cell phone is 971.533.5240 if you need to reach me

The shop she is having the work done is &quot;Frank _at_ F&amp;S (530) 241-2800&quot;

Any help is much appreciated.
Thanks!
