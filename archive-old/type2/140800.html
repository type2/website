Subject: Time to work on bus

Some folks at church gave us a 1995 Chevy Astro.  Guess they were concerned 
about the heat in the bus. :O)

This will give me the opportunity to do some work on the bus without having 
to worry about losing my daily driver.

I need to get the starter to work properly (I think it's the wire to the 
ignition switch) and fix the heat.  Needs a new muffler, headliner, and the 
square rubber thingy on the steering wheel where it goes through the floor 
(was down in there the other day and discovered it was torn).  Probably a 
few other things, too.  Well, I need to do the brakes...

I need to figure out why the driver's window on the Astro won't go all the 
way down.  The power window gets about 25% open, stops and starts to click. 
It clicks when it closes and after it reaches the top.  Sort of a pain when 
you go to the Post Office or a fast food drive through window.

It'll be good to get the bus in better shape.

Now as long as I don't get use to the heat in the Astro...
