Subject: FW: HP Calculations - HP and Torque, Part 2

And here's Part 2....

___________________




&gt; Actually, horsepower is a measurment of the amount of *work* being
&gt; performed, not power

Actually, HP _IS_ a measure of power, since power is defined as work over
time.  Moving 550 pounds one foot is a measure of work performed (550ft.lbs.

of work).  Doing that work in one second is a measure of power.

&gt; The 5252 is a constant that takes the place of a bunch of other
&gt; calculations, but the heart of it is that 1HP = 550lb-ft per second with
&gt; some Pi and some radians tossed in for good measure.

&gt;From a post on Usenet I made some time ago (in case anyone else is
interested in the gory details):

The formula HP=torque*RPM/5252 is simply an adaption
of Watt's original HP definition to a rotating crankshaft.  Let's start with
Watt's original HP definition, and derive the formula above:

1HP=33,000ft.lbs./minute

We need to produce a unit of ft.lbs./minute from our engine measurements.
Easy enough - torque is measured in ft.lbs., and speed is measured in
revolutions per minute.  Well, what's a revolution?  It's the distance
travelled around the circumference of a circle.  What's the distance of the
circumference?  2*Pi times the radius.  What's the radius?  Uh oh...  we
don't know that, because it could be anything.  We need a unit of distance
that's not dependent on the actual radius.  That's what radians are for
(among other things  :).  A radian is actually the ratio of the distance
travelled on a particular arc in relation to that arc's radius.  By using
radians, we cancel out the radius component of the distance measurement,
ending up with a dimensionless measurement of 2*Pi radians around the
circumference.

So - the distance travelled in one revolution is 2*Pi radians, or 6.2832
radians per minute.

Dividing 33,000 by 6.2832, we get 5252.1.  Round that off to 5252.

Therefore, HP=Torque*RPM/5252.
