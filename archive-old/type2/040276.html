Subject: Re: Replacing Wheel Bearings? (fwd)

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking that my problem is bad wheel bearings or a loose axle nut.

Yes, I agree 
(metoo! metoo! Sorry, just had to get that out of my system :-))

&gt; What can I do to further troubleshoot and identify the source of the
&gt; problem?  

First, pull the hubcaps and cotter pins from the rear wheels.  Take a 3/4&quot;
drive socket and drive bar (sorry, for this 1/2&quot; is a waste of time, IMHO)
and try to loosen the rear axle nuts with a twist of the wrist.  If either
comes loose, then that was the problem!  Tighten that pup back up to 200
ft/lb and put the cotter pins in and the hub caps back on.  done. 

If not, then loosen all the rear lug bolts and jack up both rear wheels.
Put the rear on jack stands with both rear wheels in the air.  Remove the
road wheels.  Grab the hubs and spin them.  Listen for the classic &quot;ballsy
rumble&quot; of bad bearings.  Try to move the drums up and down or side to
side. Play here in any direction is *not* good, tho there may be some.

&gt; How difficult is it to replace a wheel bearings ( I'm not really
&gt; looking to take them out, clean, and re-greage, but I don't know if you can
&gt; just buy replacement bearings)?  

It is a full day, but not too difficult.  Rear wheel bearings and grease
seals (you need both) are very available and not too expensive. Given the
difficulty of the job, I do *not* recommend regreasing used bearings here.
Buy the bearings, replace them.  The whole set is under $60 and there is
nothing like taking this settup apart and finding a dead bearing and
having to wait a week for a replacement to come mail-order. Get the
replacements &quot;in case&quot;, then install them because you have them.

You will need to:

lower the bus,
remove rear axle nuts,
remove the drive shafts (CV's), (at least the outer ends)
raise the rear of the bus,
remove drum and hub,
drive the stub axle out of the bearings (*),
remove two *hairy* big circlips that retain the bearings from each bearing
carrier,
drive out the old bearings,
grease and drive in new ones,
put it all back together.

It is more work than I describe, I assure you :-)

&gt; Should I replace all 4 wheel bearnings at the same time?  Any tips and
&gt; suggestions would be appreciated.

Yes, you should do both sides.  4 bearings and two grease seals.  On
wheels and brakes I am very strongly of the opinion that you should regard
an axle as the minimum work unit.  do both sides at the same time, get the
peace of mind, honest.

Tips: use a 3/4&quot; drive socket and slide bar to remove the rear axle nut!
Harbor Freight sells a nice set for &lt;$50 and I use mine extensively. 1/2&quot;
drive just does not cut it here, sorry.  Also, a 6' cheater pipe over the
end of the drive bar makes a wonderful torque multiplier.

(*) to remove the rear stub axle, the approved method is to find and use a
puller that will do the job.  I don't have one :-(  So... (flame suit on)
what I do is to reverse the axle nut on the shaft and screw it on until it
is flush.  Exactly flush, like with a steel straight edge.  Then I put a
2x4 on it and whack it with a sledge hammer.  A true mechanic would
blanch, but it does the job and I have not ruined any of the 4 stub axles
I have removed this way.  YMMV.
