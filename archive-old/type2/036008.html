Subject: REAL DATA was &quot;One-man brake bleeder&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;Have I got it right? Because if I do, some clear hose, a jelly jar, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;one of those pumps that fits on a drill chuck (8.95) will do the same
&gt;job.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That's an idea that deserves an experiment. Carefull you don't suck the
&gt;&gt; reservoir dry in 3.14159 seconds.

Piety!! Piety!! I'll have you know I stole that fair and square from Harry
Pellow, the Maestro of 356/912 fame. If you like inane and subtle
underlying meanings and Plato is to much for you, do read Harry's books.
Lots of very good ideas and tricks and REAL DATA about air cooled 4
cylinder mechanicals applicable to any maschine as well, more especially
the VW T-I/II/III/IV. Big on metalurgical investigations, failure modes,
stress risers, &quot;what went wrong, went wrong, went wrong!&quot;  Tell him Doktor
Tim sent you. Search the web for HPC Research or Harry Pellow.
