Subject: Re: [T2] avp longblock..thanks...and more

&gt; For instance..the front(front is front) 1/2 cyl lower cylinder cover
 piece has a square hole in it!..and I am missing the tin that goes above
the 1/2 cylinder in the rear(have lower piece).

Correct for 72-74 for the hot air duct going to the air cleaner. For FI, you either have to find 79 Fed
version only or make a patch to close it.

&gt; *no* thermostat parts at all.&lt;sigh&gt;..no flappers, roller..nothing.

I have extra flaps. Do you have the pulley and special bolt? If not, I have one. The thermostat is a different
story......

&gt; The fan has two blades missing..but I *did* find the rear support bar!

I have an extra fan.

&gt; Fer instance, how do you put the fan shroud together with the oil stick
 guide at such an angle(it is bent wrong right now also)...Do you put the
 oil filler tube in first and then the fan shroud? ...still playing with it
 and test fitting parts.

Put the housing together as one piece, slide it partially on the 4 studs, put the dipstick rubber hose on the
tube on the back of  housing, put the oil filler pipe on the end of the hose. As you slide the housing in on
the studs, line up the oil pipe on the lower stud [don't forget the gasket].
