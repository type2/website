All of a sudden the Mothership starts acting up.  

Today I pulled up to a stop sign, and it wants to choke down on me.  I cranked it back up, it ran fine, I pulled out onto the highway.  As I am running along about 60, I took my foot off the gas pedal, when I once agian accelerated, it wanted to lurch and jump.

It does it sporatically and without apparnet prompting.  It doesn't do it everytime I stop either.

It is a 1979 with a pancake.

Any advice form you more learned volks?
