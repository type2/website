John vwbus is too hard on the $3500 engine price, but right on as far as
doing one's own work.  

Re: $3500 -- People want it both ways.  They want a &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine for
$800, and then are surprised when the engine stops giving good service
at 11,000 miles or 20 minutes out of warranty, whichever is sooner.  The
right parts and no-shortcut procedures are hugely expensive and VW isn't
even the worst of it.  I just paid $165 for the gasket set for a 77
Porsche engine.  Head studs (24 per engine) are about $15 apiece.  P&amp;C
set is over $1000.

Re: your own work -- It's the only basis on which I can afford to enjoy
German cars.  I admire, without wanting to emulate, those who choose
these old busses as their &quot;gotta run on Monday&quot; cars.  Even when I can
put in the time to do the job myself, I can't put it in on a schedule,
so I have to have the Japanese cars that are useful, and affordable, on
a non-hobby basis.  And as John vwbus points out, even doing your own
work is not going to make old busses sensible in terms of return on
investment.
