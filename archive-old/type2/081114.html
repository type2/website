Good to see you made it home Jason  :)  One more question.  The short
fuel line going to the injector....i cant get the thing to come off of
the injector and I have pulled pretty hard.  These do come off right ??

If I remember correctly between the pump on one end &amp; the pressure reg
on the other there isn't much fuel that will spill out. But.....you're
not going to stop with only those lines, are you? I would highly
recommend replacing the entire loop of rubber. That includes the lines
that connect the tank to the pump/filter/press reg. You won't have to
worry about it after doing this. If you are feeling froggy, you can
also install a cut off valve on each of the tank connections (this is
how I was able to change my fuel pump at EB &amp; only slightly smell like
gas, which was an improvement from my prior smell (: ) Good luck.

or
&gt; keep dripping until I plug them? For everyone else, this is a 78 with
a
&gt; typeIV. Thanks again.
