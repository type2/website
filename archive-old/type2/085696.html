But it is!!! It is west of the Mississippi!!!  I saw it tonight.  I believe 
it is headed even farther west over the coming weeks and months.

&gt; &gt;I must have missed it. Who ended up w/ the hubcap after
&gt; &gt;EB this year?
&gt;
&gt;I don't know, but I'd be willing to bet it STILL hasn't made it's way West 
&gt;of
&gt;the Mississippi and probably never will :(

I wake up every morning determined both to change the world and have one
hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
