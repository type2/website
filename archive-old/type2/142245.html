Subject: Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

I am helping a friend try to install a set of CB performance carbs on his Type
2 bus. I have the same set, but never installed them, currently running stock
carbs. We got them on and the bus started. After it ran for about 2 minutes or
so, I turned it off. It ran ok, but was somewhat erratic at idle. I noticed
that the right carb manifold was hot and the left carb manifold was cool to
the tough. The only adjustments that we have had time to make is to set the
volume screw two 1/2 turns out on each carb and some basic syncing of the
carbs. They are still not synced, but I wanted to get feedback about the heat
before we run it to long.

What does the hot manifold mean or maybe the cool manifold mean? I think the
hot side is probably the problem and not the cool side. It did not run long at
all. I thought maybe it was running lean on that side and creating more heat?
We hope to work on it again this week, anything else I should be looking for
besides the volume screw and the sync of the carbs. This bus was running fine
before the carb switch, but like me they are replacing a weber progressive
carb. Got some basic troubleshooting techniques for me?

Also, anyone have good or bad experience with the AJ Sims Kadron carbs? If
these carbs have problems we will be needing another set and the Kadrons from
AJ looked nice with him setting them up.

Thanks,
Corbett
