&gt; That makes my blood boil. Absolutely inexcusable.

I'm willing to bet that the black handles are repros and the brown are
made by VW.  Often the repro manufacturers syphon off the business for
the most common parts, leaving the odd parts to the OE manufacturers.

I wonder what the black handles would cost if you got them from VW?
