&gt; Don't know... I've never had the oil drain plug out.  I'm a bit too

&gt; &gt;One other question - my oil drain plug is really hard to get out (it's one
&gt; &gt;of those allen wrench ones) and I'm not sure how hard I should try to get
&gt; it
&gt; &gt;out... could I possibly do other damage to the case?

some years ago I overtightened the oil drain bolt and it broke, managed to
find a longer bolt to grab some threads and pulled it carefully tight.
that's been well over 5 years ago and I haven't touched it since, do all
my oil changes thru the drain plug, and yes it was a real bear to get
loose the first time.  basically just put a good bit of pull then push
then pull on the socket handle til it finally came loose.  I suspect those
threads can take a lot more abuse.  sort of figure the oil filter will
grab anything worth talking about and as long as my oil presure stays up
(I have guages) I won't worry about it....
