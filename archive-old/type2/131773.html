Subject: Pulley Woodruff Key, 2.0L Size

Anybody have the size/deminsions of the Wodruff Key on the Crank for the 
Pullet, on a 2.0L engine. I think the part number is #113105249. I want to 
find one at the locally but I don't have the old one and nobody around here 
stcks it. All the stores that carry stock woodruff keys can't cross 
refference them.
