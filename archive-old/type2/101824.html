Subject: Re: [T2] can't figure out where this hose goes!

&gt;While trying to get through some stuff to make my 76 bus pass smog I ran
&gt;across a small hose underneath my bus that had been cut and had a screw
&gt;stuck in it.

Pictures would really help.  All of the FI hoses that I'm aware of are contained within the engine compartment. The brake booster hose leaves the engine compartment from the left side of the air distribution box and goes through the firewall also on the left. It has a valve in it and I think a tee if you have an automatic.

Did the bus originally have an automatic transmission? Does it now?

&gt;From what I can tell it has something to do with the fuel injection, but
&gt;I am unable to determine where it should connect.  When I take the screw
&gt;out it sucks air.  Also it is a side shoot of a larger hose that goes
&gt;into what I think is the fuel injection part of the engine.  When I pull
&gt;this hose out of the socket the engine dies.  Does anyone know what this
&gt;hose is or have any suggestions how I can figure out what it is.  I have
&gt;3 VW manuals and even using these I am unable to determine what the hose
&gt;is.  If anyone can help me I sure would appreciate it.
