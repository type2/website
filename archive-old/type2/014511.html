Hello, I'm new to this list.  I live in Southern New Mexico, and have a 68
bus.  My question for today is about the doors.  My passenger door won't
open.  When it is in the unlocked position, the mechanisms inside the door
move to a position that prohibits the push knob(with the keyhole in it) from
being pushed in.  When the door is locked the mechanisms slide out of the
way of the push knob, but the door won't open as it is locked.  Anyone else
ever have this problem or know of a solution? Any suggestions would be
greatly apreciated as I have spent many hours watching my door lock and
unlock repeatedly with glazed eyes... 
                        
Letting my friends in from the inside...Matt
