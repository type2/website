Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Denver: High road or low road?

This makes sense, but going south to El Cajon and over the mountains on 
the 8 doesn't. Take the Riverside Freeway out of OC to Riverside, catch 
the 10, leave it in Indio, and skirt the Salton Sea to El Centro. Pick 
up the 8 there.

&gt; Los
&gt; Cruces you are travelling along the Rio Grand and it has very little 
&gt; slope
&gt; until you exit Albuqueque.
