&gt;can get get NYC in less time than a trip to the west end of the upper
&gt;peninsula) that cleaned and lined my bus tank.  It cost me $165, and I
think
&gt;he gave me a break, but it's cleaned and coated inside and out with miracle


Not that much of a break, going price around me (in BF nowhere WV) is about
$65 for the boil, then about another $40 if you want it coated, depending on
tank size, those numbers for a '70 Bus tank.  Of course the problem with
&quot;lifetime garantees&quot; from gas tank shops is they are only good usually till
the feds start tinkering with gas formulations again.  And if you've been
doing this for even as little as about 10 years, you start to note that soon
thereafter a lot of times these places go bankrupt then open &quot;under new
management.&quot;  Hard to fault them really, most formulations are durable
enough if acid ethced well first to totally clean, just can't predict the
future.  Failure of past formulations in my experience has been the ones
that dissolve to a gooey mess with alchohol gas and others than begine to
splinter and delaminate, either WAY not good.

FWIW radiator shops in general also do gas tanks when people look in the
yellow pages.  And of course with some new tanks running in the $100 range,
shop around carefully before having something coated.
