Subject: Owner's manual.

I have all the maintenance manuals I need to completely disassemble and
reassemble my 75 adventure van, but I don't have a simple owner's manual
which tells you how to do things like add oil to the engine, hook up the
water tank, operate the refrigerator, etc.

Any recommendations?  Books still in print?
