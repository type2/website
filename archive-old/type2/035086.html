Subject: BBB IV

I'll be heading to BBB. Camp Friday night in the desert, Saturday at
Quartzite for the rock and gem show (my wife is a geologist), and then
arrive Saturday afternoon at BBB. Will be driving my '79 beige Westy,
freshly painted pop top, Sunbrella blue striped curtains, and CA whale
license plates 2TDF. 

I'll be on the lookout for list members.
