Subject: Re: [T2] Belt-eating crank pulley

Those pulleys can be a bitch to get off. I recently bent one into a banana 
shape with my vw crankshaft pulley puller, ruined the pulley and the puller, 
and it was still there. Mark Dearing suggested using a chisel.  Remove the 
bolt and washer, hit the central inside part of the pulley with the long 
chisel, right on top of the Woodruff key(that part is important). Not so 
hard that you damage anything, lots of little hits. It worked. Avoid hitting 
the cases or prying on them. That'd probably bitch what's left of the 
pulley, but it's not great anyway, right?
I bought a new Bruck pulley from CIP-it's nice.

Still working on this 1500 SP. I noticed that the
inside surface of the crank pulley is pitted and rough
from sitting so long before I got it.  It tends to
shred belts! So, is putting on a new crank pulley as
easy as putting a flywheel lock on, removing the
pulley bolt and simply slapping another one on, or is
it more involved??  Anybody have any tips for this
job??  How many PSI is that sucker supposed to be
cranked to??


Peace, John Baker
