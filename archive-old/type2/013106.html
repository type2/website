Hi type2 list, 
  I'm mostly a vintage bus list person but am a long time lurker of the
type2 list and a big fan of all buses everywhere. I just thought somebody
on this list might be interested in this bus, it's in Fort Worth, Texas. 
The guy selling it is the 2nd owner and it has only 59,766 actual miles.
It has 4 new tires, 4 new shocks, 4 new tie rod ends, new drag link, and
all wheel cylinders and master cylinder are rebuilt. CV joints are
repacked and they have new boots. It has extractor exhaust and a degreed
pully wheel. The original owner installed a small crank open skylight w/
electric fan. There's also an AM-FM radio and genuine 8-track player. The
price is $2200, if you're interested call Doug at (817) 457-1471. Tell
him Chris the lawn care guy in the old bus told you to call :)
