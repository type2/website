Subject: T1 Oil Dipstick tube - came out!

Hi All -

The obvious question is: How do I re-secure it?

Caveats: It is an AutoLinea aluminum case. The tube itself looks to  
be aluminum as well.

I measured a standard (brass?) tube on a standard AS41 case, and it  
hangs out 1.5&quot;. I tried to remove the standard one out of the  
standard case, but can't get a grip on it due to it crushing.

So I know that the collar on the dip stick needs to stop 1.5&quot; from  
the case to be accurate, right? Assuming that the part of the  
AutoLinea case is consistent with said part on an AS41.

Ideas?

Mike
