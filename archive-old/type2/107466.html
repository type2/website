Subject: balast resisters?

Hello,

I installed a Crane PS20 fireball ignition coil, and the directions said
that if you had a Bosch blue coil before, you needed to install the
included ballast resistor between the ignition and the + side of the
coil.

I did this, and it seems to work ok, but the ceramic casing for the
ballast resister is getting really damn hot after only about 10 minutes.
Is that a normal reaction for a ballast resistor, or a sign something
may be wrong? 

Thanks for any advise you can throw my way...

BTW - I will be attending the Busses In The Shop show this weekend in
San Jose. I hope to see a few other bay owners there as well.

Christopher
