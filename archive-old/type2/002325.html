    A friend of mine has a 72 Dormobile and she is missing the right Rear
Emergency Brake arm that is under the hub.  Anybody have one at a =
decent price?
The local used Import Auto parts has busses and I was quoted a price of $20
bucks over the phone but when I got there he says &quot;Have you ever had to pull
one of those hubs?&quot;  I raised the Left Rear piece to show him I had.  Then
he says&quot;You know those VW's have been sitting in the dirt for over 5 years?&quot;
I said all I want is the part not the life history of your VW's.  He says&quot;
I'll have to charge you $100 if I send my guy out there to pull the hub&quot; I
said I called and you quoted me $20 for the part  No it will have to be $100
As I walked out as I thought of the list.  I know that one of you has a bus
that you are parting out and I need the Right Rear emergency brake arm that
is inside of the hub so that the bus will have emergency brakes.
Thanks for your help
