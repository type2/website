&gt; 20 years ago,, after experiencing many of the pump problems described on
&gt; this list, I stopped depending on my in-bus pump.  When we travel, we just
&gt; carry a few gallons of distilled water in plastic gallon jugs. We lift the
&gt; jug from the storage cabinet to the top of the sink, take the lid off the
&gt; jug and tip it up, and water runs out until we change the jug's position
&gt; and put the lid back on....gravity rather than a mechanical pump. Works
&gt; really great every time and has no additional initial cost. Maintenance is
&gt; near zero, just recycle the empty jug. We get a new jug with each gallon of
&gt; distilled water, usually about 65 cents at Wal-Mart. And that includes the
&gt; water.
&gt;
&gt; If you like the simplicity of air-cooled engines compared to water-cooled,
&gt; consider using disposable water jugs in your bus instead of relying on the
&gt; complexities and responsibilities of a mechanical plumbing system involving
&gt; a water pump and tubes and gaskets and annual maintenance to keep it from
&gt; freezing, not to mention the potential electrical problems if it is battery
&gt; operated. And if your budget is incredibly tight, refill the jugs with tap
&gt; water and use them over a few times.

Another approach is to use 5-gallon plastic carboys like are used in
science labs.  These are big poly jugs with a 3 inch or so fill opening
and a tap at the bottom.  You can secure them next to a sink to provide a
pumpless source of water.  They can be refilled in place with a hose or
easily carried to a source of water.
