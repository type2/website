&gt; So what is the actual configuration of a 1500s...in other words, what
&gt; makes it go 96hp?

VW designed it

. 1492cc
. 12.8-1 compression
. twin 34PDSIT carbs
. Cam???

it was designed for the type 3 Karmen Ghia/formula 3/formula V vehicles.

the Avenger weighed 1,111lbs ready to race config  formula 3/grp 3

a very few of these engines showed up in the USA in the mid 60s on type 3
cars they could be identified by a roman letter S following the 1500.
engine serial numbers began with the letter X.  (they are not in the
regular motor fiche's only a few places had the correct fiche with the
parts

I picked mine up in Germany and &quot;snuck&quot; it into the country as the engine
in my vw, when I brought it back with me when I was being shipped home in
the army.

dang thing needed 102 octane gas to run right!
