Subject: Re: [T2] Water tank removal ('79 Westy)

Wayne wants to know:


 My water tank is leaking in my '79 Westy... not sure if it is pump, drain
valve or the tank.  So, I thought I'd remove the water tank to make it
easier to isolate and repair the problem... so, what's the easiest way to
take the tank out?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It takes a little work but it does come out.

Gently remove the filler neck [a claw hammer works if you are careful]
Remove the little plastic nailed in stops holding the wood wall in at the bottom. [wire cutters work if you
are careful]
Gently remove the wall.
Loosen the 2 clamps holding the pump and the drain hose. Unscrew the drain fitting. Then unscrew the pump.
Now remove the phillips screws holding on the black rubber things.
Tank slides out by lifting the back end so the two holes clear the shelf.

Cracked tanks are not really sealable. I hace not found a glue that bonds to it for long.....

I have a good used one if you need it.
