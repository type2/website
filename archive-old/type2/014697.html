George,

I kinda disagree with you on this issue.

My 74 Westy has had a K&amp;N for 33,000 miles, or all it's life.

My 85 GL has had a K&amp;N for 177.000 miles or half of it's life

My 86 BMW 325E has had a K&amp;N for 227,000 miles or all of it's life

My 86 Honda Goldwing has had a K&amp;N for 123,000 miles or all of it's
life.

If a vehicle is used for traveling down the big asphalt ribbon, the
chances of ingesting mass doses of abrasives is limited.

None of my vehicles present or past have been without the benefit of K&amp;N
filtration.

And none of my current vehicles use one ounce of oil between periodic
maintenance.

One more thought----My 76 TT 500 Yamaha dirt bike has had a  K&amp;N since
it was new, and the upper end has never been apart due to filtration
failure.( or for any other reason either)

K&amp;N filters, has been an excellent addition to any vehicle I have ever
installed them on, when properly maintained.

Later,
