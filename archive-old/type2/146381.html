Subject: Rattle Can Epoxy Primer

Hello,
I've used High Build Primer from a can. It is not a Lacquer Primer.  The 
propaganda states it is not porous.  It wasn't cheap.  Worked fine for a small 
repair.  Since it's not Lacquer Primer isn't this Epoxy Primer.  This requires no 
mixing.

Like all Wurth products I've used in the past they are great, just abit 
costly. I had a small repair from last fall that is still primered with no rust 
coming through from underneath (never got to it before the cold).

My bus was taken down to bare metal and PPG DPLF Epoxy Primer was  
used. That was one heavy can of paint. I mean really heavy!
