Rick,

My JC Whitney Catalog has a Heater Blower Kit.  Part 54XW1272R at 
1-800-867-4227 or www.jcwhitney_dot_com.  Let me know if it works.  I hope to 
install myself in the near future.

&gt; But I now cannot find the emails I thought I had saved.  For those of you
&gt; that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would you please send me a
&gt; source for them so I can order one?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
