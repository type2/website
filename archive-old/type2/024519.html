&gt;RMMW catalog shows the following for buses:
&gt;68-69 (to ch#219060788)     3670mm/144.49&quot;
&gt;69-71 (from ch#219060789)  3680mm/144.88&quot;
&gt;72         3700mm/145.67&quot;
&gt;73-74    3655mm/143.90&quot;
&gt;75-79    3458mm/136.14&quot;

Any idea about the length of a 73 bus with a Holley carb conversion? mine is too long and the pedal is bottoming out
and the rpms wont get up high enough.

Also there's a spring under the gas pedal, - very rusty and weak - looks like you have to remove the rusty hinge pin
in order to change the spring - anyone have any fixes for this?
