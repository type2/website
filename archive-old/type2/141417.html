Subject: Re: [T2] Hubcap Story...

I had a continental tire disintigrate on me last aug.... on the way to Buses of
the Corn.
That tire left a few inches of the sidewall on the rim,, the rest ... who
knows....
but we didn't suffer any wild ride... no excitement... I just steered to the
shoulder,, and brought it to a controlled stop.
Got out and dropped my JAW,,, as I thought it was just flat......
I was stunned as I had just checked tires less than an hour before...

Most damage was to the fender lip and inside the wheel well...

I thank my lucky stars.......  maybe that is the difference of a Bay bus at
75mph,, and a Split.....

But,, in my search of replacement tires ... I found that tire was at it's rated
age,, and milage,,  5 years. 50,000 miles.. even though it had tread left.....
it was tired,,no pun intended

I have seen plenty of good tires turn bad as soon as you put them on ..... just
simply tooo old.
That old spare your carrying,, just in case you have a puncture,,,  it may only
be good enough to get you off the highway... not safe to drive that last few
hundred miles

ymmv

&gt; Out of curiosity I'd like to know the load rating of that tire although from
the report age seems to be what's been blamed for the failure.
