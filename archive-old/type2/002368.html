As for your poptop, put a good coat of wax on the top after the x14 bit and
you will be amazed! The wax fills in all the millions of scratches in the
fiberglass and returns the top to a uniform white(x14 leaves the scratches
noticeably darker). I just did this a few weeks ago and it looks fantastic.
Paint the hardware while you are up there and it won't rust stain the top .
Now if you can find a cleaner to cut the mold on the inside of the poptop
(felt) I'd like to hear about it.
For the front carpet, you might try 3M spray adhesive of go to Lowes or Home
Depot and you'll find a good cure in a caulk-like tube.
