&gt; Mike (TGIF):  the casting fool....
&gt; How about a repro'd  HORN BUTTON with an embossed/or/engraved . . .

If I can ever figure out how to remove the horn button without destroying it
or the steering wheel, I'll add it to the list of &quot;Things to Busify in
Resin&quot;.

&gt; 1) Wolfsburg Crest
While I really like the 1951-1959 bug crest, but no can do.

&gt; 2) Funny Type 2 bus logo/picture...
Could do this, but would have to tiptoe delicately around copyright issues
(what's a &quot;tear bus&quot;?).

&gt; 3)  Script saying   EJECT  or  PULL  or  LOJAK    or   TYPE2_at_TYPE2.COM
Another &quot;can do&quot; (what's a &quot;LOJAK&quot;)?

&gt; 4)  an inverted VW logo...
Cute, but again, copyright... (and the potential liability problems with
drivers who say to passengers &quot;Hey!  Wanna see what my neat horn button can
do?&quot; [swerve-skid-crash-beeeeeeeepppppppppppp]).

&gt; 5)  the stick shift pattern so the valets at the Hilton or Ritz can find
&gt; reverse...
Now THIS is an intriguing concept, as well as practical, too.

&gt; 6)  Road Kill count . . .
I'm owned by a bunny (Eastern Cottontail, and yes, his name is &quot;Peter&quot;), so
I'd have to consider maybe possums for tally marks... or mailboxes... or
maybe disposable diapers...

&gt; 7)  'Get out of jail free' dude from Monopoly
Not even going there, Milton Bradley would have my hide.

&gt; 8)  Anything scribed in braille
(Mind, I have friends who are medically blind, so this is not meant as a
slight or as a disparaging remark.)  Like maybe &quot;If you can read this, what
are you doing driving my bus?!&quot;

&gt; 9)  A note saying   'The key is under the mat'
Or, &quot;Press 3 Times to Disarm Alarm&quot;

&gt; 10)   {{  Anyone else ? ? ?  }}
- Buttons of just about any color, including colored translucents.
- Button with a phone jack in the center with the word &quot;Network&quot; just above
it.
- Button with a grounded 120 volt (or European) receptacle in the center.
- Button with camera lens centered in it (for Mulders everywhere, &quot;They're
watching you.&quot;)
- Button with tiny spikes for those who need a gentle reminder to lay off
the horn...

Remember, placing new casting ideas in the head of a guy who makes his
entire living from making toys can be hazardous to his work load... :O)
