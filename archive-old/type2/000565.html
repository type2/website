&gt;    Is there a way to inroduce a Reverse light indicator to the dash? Would
&gt;this just involve running a wire from dash light to the reverse light so
&gt;when it is engaged the light on the dash will go on?

Should be easy enough. Just take a wire from downstream of the fuse that
serves this circuit, run it to the dash light then back to ground. it will
come on and off with the rear lights.

On mine the fuse is in line in the engine compartment as it was a later
addition.
