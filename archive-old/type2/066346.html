&gt;Hi Pete,

&gt;Considering the effort involved in pulling the engine, I would replace
&gt;everything but the kitchen sink inside the bellhousing: Clutch, pressure
&gt;plate, throwout bearing, engine front oil seal and pilot shaft bearing. Get
&gt;the kit from RMMW, it has all these parts and they
&gt;carry the top quality german SACHS clutches. Also get a new flywheel o-ring
&gt;(not oncluded in the kit and almost always worn out...).

I disagree - only replace the clutch, t/o bearing, and pressure plate if
there was something wrong with them, or if you have money growing on trees
in your back yard.  As has been mentioned here before, pulling the pilot
bearing can snowball into a really long hard job so unless you've done it
before and are confident you can do it, I'd leave it be (again, assuming it
is in good condition).  Replace the seals and put it back together and the
clutch will more than likely outlive the engine.  My two cents.
