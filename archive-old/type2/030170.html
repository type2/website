&gt; &gt;But I am concerned about the discussions on load rating though.  I'm looking
&gt; &gt;at the BFG A/T's which have a load rating of C and max load of 1515 _at_ 50psi
&gt; &gt;according to their web site.  Would this be acceptable for a bus?  Also, are
&gt; &gt;there any personal experiences with this or any similar tire in this size?

VW's minimum load rating is 1540 pounds for my '71.  Perhaps you should
look at a &quot;D&quot; rated tire.
