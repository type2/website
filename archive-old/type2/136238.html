Subject: Re: [T2] Degreasers

&gt; I've found that the most effective (and cheapest) water-soluable
&gt; degreaser for both parts and hands is liquid Tide (the blue stuff),
&gt; full strength. More effective than the citrus-based cleaners,
&gt; unfortunately. Rinse with water and dry.

Palmolive or other liquid dish soaps is pretty effective too.
I still like the smell of simple green though.&gt;
