Subject: Re: [T2] Running problems with a 78 fuel injection Bus
Content-Disposition: inline

About two weeks ago I wrote and told you about my bus that runs fine until it warms up and then runs like crap, if I can even keep it running.  Many responded back and said replace the sensor by cyclinder #3.  Well, I got my replacement sensor and installed it last night but it didn't make a difference.  

So, I am asking again for any suggestions.  

I did do the test someone suggested and ground the sensor wire and that didn't make a difference either but I thought I'd try a new sensor anyway.  

Any help would greatly be apprecited.

Thanks.
