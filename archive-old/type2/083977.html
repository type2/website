Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank venting

If there is enough vacuum to pull your plug into the tank, maybe that
same vacuum is preventing enough gas from leaving the tank when your
engine is running at higher speeds.  Try removing the gas cap next time
your experience this problem.  If it disappears, then the excess vacuum
in the gas tank is causing your flow problem (in which case you should
consider replumbing the vent lines).

Take care
-Roger

&gt; where I started.
