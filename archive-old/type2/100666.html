Subject: RE: [T2] Back door cargo rubber ?

&gt; &gt; So in either case, $79.95 gets you the best available quality.
&gt; &gt; Our part # 211 829 193E.


&gt; Ron, are you sure about this part number?
&gt; On your 68+ listing, you list 68-79 as all being the same.
&gt; I believe 64 to 71 is the same, but 72-79 is different


Yes, I'm sure.  Technically you're right, 64-71 and 72-79 list different VW
part numbers. But despite this distinction in part number, the actual seals
are virtually identical.  In fact, many vendors (i.e. Just Kampers) don't
list the 193C at all, and just list the 193E for both applications.  I list
the 193C on the website just for the convenience of people who have found
that number on another site and do a part number search.
