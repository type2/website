Subject: big trip maintenence

Hello,

Any suggestions or thoughts on what types of maintenence to do to your bus 
before a really big trip? 3 weeks on the road, going up and over 
mountains/etc.

Just the usual, or anything &quot;special&quot; ?

Hydraulic lifters on the motor in my bus, do you adjust those ever?

I am going up to see a new friend at Valley Wagonworks in San Anselmo on 
Sunday morning and going to go over some things and make sure everything is 
up to par. This will really be my only chance to really get everything 
ready.
