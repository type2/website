&gt;And so far the HF Chinese one has outlasted the high $$ one!

The Sears jack I bought 4 years ago seems to be the best value out there. It's made in China as well but the cylinder will probably last longer than the average HF jack.

I believe all Sears jacks have a 1-yr warranty (maybe less) unlike a lot of the other tools they sell.

My only beef about the jack is that it weighs 90 lbs. I haven't seen an aluminum jack I'd like to buy either.
