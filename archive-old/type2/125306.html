Subject: RE:HCBF

HCBF is always the last weekend in July.  Sometimes it rolls over into Aug.
as it does this year.
Website is http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~contecmidwest/ but hasn't been updated
yet.
Correct dates are Thursday July 29 - Sunday Aug 1, 2004
near Boone, NC

Hope this helps.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
