Another option - I used to work for a sign shop where we used regular 
automotive enamel and applied it with a foam roller on signs.

On flat metal I could get very, very good smooth gloss.

The trick is to not thin it. Apply it and smooth it out will increasingly 
light passes. Final coats with almost no pressure on the paint (once it had 
begun to harden - maybe 10 minutes?).

Always wondered if I could do a car or bus this way.

Not bad for a paint job without a spray gun.
