My clock kept draining the battery over a couple of days when the VW was not
driven, so I disconnected it.

Would this be easy to fix? Could it be that it was permanently being
rewound?

&gt; Most of these clocks are driven by a little spring device. As the clock runs
&gt; the spring winds down and these two contacts inside the clock make contact,
&gt; when they do, a solinoid kicks the spring and contact back, winding it up
&gt; for another 10 minutes.
