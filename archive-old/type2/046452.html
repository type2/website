&gt; Yeah, I'm with ya there. I've got all kinds of tabs and posties and sh!t
&gt; hanging out the sides and top, and pertinent list posts printed-out for
&gt; bookmarkers in appropriate sections. I'm gonna need a bungee cord to hold
&gt; the thing together soon. I really need to get to the stationery store and
&gt; get some of those page-edge stick-on permanent tabs for notebooks and make
&gt; my Bentley all nice and neat.

I'd be even happier if Bentley manuals had 5/8&quot; in the gutter, so I could
three-hole drill the manual, cut the glue binding off and put it in a
three-ring binder.
