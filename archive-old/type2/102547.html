Subject: Re: [T2] was 1974 VW Bus...now fuel line rant

Hi Volks,

For those with carburetors on their buses, I would recommend visiting 
the local motorcycle repair shop. They usually sell clear fuel lines in 
a variety of sizes.  Clear line can be quite helpful in diagnosing fuel 
flow problems, as sometimes happens with bad pumps and/or clogged 
filters.

I haven't heard of many problems with the 72-74 fuel pumps (yet), but 
since these are virtually NLA a lot of people are switching over to 
electric pumps.

Happy trails,

&gt; Wakanska, thanks for that line!  I am having the same problem...
&gt;
&gt; I buy *new* line at the local vwflaps and 1 year later it leaks!!!
&gt; This line is marked &quot;made in Germany&quot; and looks exactlly like it always
&gt; does.
&gt;
&gt; Fired up my 68 bug last weekend(sitting for 3 months)...and it cranked 
&gt; up
&gt; pretty good.BUT!  Went back to check the engine and look it over while 
&gt; it
&gt; warmed up and the fuel lines that I put on last fall were already 
&gt; leaking.
