Subject: Re: [T2] oil galley plugs

What type of plug did you use? I mean what type of metal? I have read
somewhere
that it would be best to use brass as that has a thermal expansion
coefficient
close to Aluminum.

Any suggestions for the best way to remove the plugs?

&gt; You should be able to buy generic freeze plugs for this.
&gt; You may have to shop for metric sizes but they should be a generic
item
&gt; at FLAPS...
