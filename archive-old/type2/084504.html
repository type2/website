Subject: steering question

--=====================_3432725==_.ALT

After spending mucho $$$ on complete front end rebuild, the front end is 
nice and tight!....as a matter of fact, it's TOO tight....after turning a 
corner, the steering wheel does not return to normal forward position 
easily.  What could be causing this?  Is the whole front end just too 
tight?  The mechanic and I have adjusted the steering box in both 
directions with no effect.  Any opinions?  tx...
