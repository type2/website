Subject: Anyone Interested in mechanical injection for type 2?

Hi,
I have been discussing mechanical fuel injection conversion for my bus with 
Gary Miller of miller fuel injection [check out his webpage-address at the 
end of this note] and I recieved the following reply regarding his producing 
a kit to fill our application and allowing us to scrounge our own parts. He 
asked that I pass it on so here it is.


Gary,
&gt;  Have you thought about making a kit to convert Type2 EFI to CIS If you
&gt;sold the runners brackets and lines etc. and let the owner scrounge the FI
&gt;stuff it would be in reach of the budgetarily challenged among us who own 
&gt;these things.
&gt;I think that due to the rising costs of maintaining EFI systems[less
&gt;junkyard parts] and the fact that they will leave you on the side of the
&gt;road from time to time pretty much means that if you could put together a
&gt;kit for say $250.00 to$300.00 it would be competitive with a Weber
&gt;replacement[assuming you can get the FI stuff for about$100.00] It would
&gt;also give you a wider audience for your higher performance products. I 
&gt;don't
&gt;know if you have ever logged on to www.type2_dot_com but they have 50 postings 
&gt;a
&gt;day so there are alot of these things still alive out there.
&gt;  Live well,
&gt;  Pat Price

First off, thanks for the contact and interest. Please post his reply
wherever you chose, I need you just as you need me.
I welcome all inquiries, e-mail is best. Scrounging in wrecking yards is my
least favorite part of the business, so I hear your point.

Type 2 is sort of nondescript, to me there are T1, T4 and waterboxer buses
(and pickups, vanagons).
I have converted several T1(done)  and T4 (soon) motors in Bus vehicles.
Since I can't fit into Bug or T3,
Bus(all), 914, Thing (181) and Ghia are my best street applications.

The majority of the cost is in the custom parts you describe, but there are
some mods to
the FI setup.  I want to make sure people aren't frying themselves
with incorrect fuel lines and
sueing me, so I have to be a little careful.

Note the T4 conversion is less than the the T1 stuff, less breather mods to
deal with...

How many of you would rather find the unmodified parts on your own,
includuing new fuel and air filters?

I'd like at least 20 replies, hint hint.

Gary
PS. CIS is Y2K compliant.
