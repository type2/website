Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic...


&gt;&gt;&gt;Looked at the flourescent trouble lights and wondered if they were
really better.

The question is...who uses what and why?&gt;&gt;&gt;


I use the flourescent ones that screw into my regular shoplight.  They are =
just household 'money savers'.  Since I'm still in the U.K. I can't run =
out and look for you, but they are the kind that come to a point.  Avoid =
the ones that are two &quot;loops&quot; because they get broken fairly easily when =
you drop things on them.  They cost more than the heavy filament bulbs, =
but they last significantly longer.  I find them bright enough for me, but =
still manage to drop the upper engine to tranny nuts into impossible =
places to see.

Cheers, Mark=20
