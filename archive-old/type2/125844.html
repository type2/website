Subject: Spray Guns was DIY Bus Painting

Britt, and others posting on this topic --

Now that I'm retired, I am looking forward to painting again.  It may be 25 
years since I did my last complete -- a Splitty in blue and white that turned 
out just fine.  Well, maybe not Pebble Beach concours, but pretty nice.  Sorry 
to note Centari seems to be off the market.  Also used to like shooting Sherwin 
Williams but haven't found a dealer where I live now [Washington/Baltimore 
area].  Anyway, can you help me out with SATA...  What does the acronym stand 
for?  Should I think about upgrading from my trusty old Binks and Binks clones?

Incidentally, reading for the last few weeks, I don't see that anyone has 
touched on the matter of scaffolding when painting roofs.  It is so much nicer 
to be able to walk the length of the Bus, than to have to move a stepladder 
(and scar-up the raingutters).  Any disagreement?

Thanx,  Glenn

The paint shops in Cali have SATA knock offs for about $150.  I can't tell
you how much easier my SATA was to use. No color sanding or buffing. It
really helps in areas like the vent grills on a Splitty when it's nice after
you shoot.
