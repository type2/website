&gt;By the way, that warning light is spring loaded.  Pressing it should cause
it 
&gt;to light.  That serves as a check that the warning system is working.

BTW that little tidbit is only good till sometime in the early 70's and may
not
be the case by '72.  I remember the first time sombody told me that I thought
they were crazy (Dolan, and he is too) as I had at the time only mostly owned
post '74 Buses and had never tried to push it in.  Definitely the spring
loaded
light (which I guess is a bug part) is gone by about '74 and maybe earlier.

Most likely cause of this as mentioned is the parking brake switch, but
when that light comes on, if jiggling the brake doesn't turn it off, STOP
immediately, check fluid level, go home stop and check for leaks.

Brakes is #1 system on any car volks.
