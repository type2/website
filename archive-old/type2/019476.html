Subject: RE: [T2] Hello, I'm new!

Welcome to the club, Jason!

A '69 Westy is a fine bus. Easy to work on, fairly easy to find parts
for. Yeah, those later pancake buses are faster and cushier, but not as
easy or cheap to fix...

I normally post to the VintageBus list, I'm just here to catch up on the
latest about Kristen's tragedy...

You may find the VintageBus list to be helpful, instead of or in
addition to this list, as we use the same type of engine your '69 has.
Also, check out the A.I.R.S. site, and you will find lots of helpful bus
friends there. You may want to find another bus person locally to look
at your potential new bus, just to make sure you know what you're
getting into...

Get the Muir Bible, then get a Bentley manual. Go to some bus
gatherings!

My first bus ('71 Westy) was the best thing that ever happened to me,
and it just keeps gettin' better with my current one ('67 Westy). Baby,
once you've owned a bus, you never go back!
