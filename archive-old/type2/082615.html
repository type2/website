Well, ok -one list member. What follows is a message David Bell sent me.
David - forgive me for posting this to the list without your permission, =
but i
feel it is good info that can only help to clear the air...and maybe sell=
 some
distributors for John.

Without further ado:

&quot;My bus came to me with a failing 1700 and a brand new AVP 1800 long bloc=
k
which I installed shortly after the purchase. The original motor had been=

fitted with a single can dizzy which, judging from the numbers, belongs o=
n a
Beetle. When I built the 1800 I installed an 009 because I could get it a=
nd
because I can usually get any a/c VW to run with one. The 009 did give me=
 the
usual hesitation and soft top end due to the short advance curve. I avera=
ged
about 12mpg in town and 16-17 on the highway.

I bought the Bosch SVDA from John at aircooled_dot_net and haven't regretted =
it
for a minute. The hesitation is gone, acceleration is improved, hills are=

easier, and mileage is up to 15 in town and a solid 20 on the open road u=
sing
87 octane. I set the timing to 6 BTDC at idle and have a maximum advance =
of 42
BTDC at ~3000RPM. (My tach/dwell only reads to 2000RPM!)

I've never run a dual can on anything so I can't compare them to the sing=
le
can, but I can definitely recommend the single can as a big improvement o=
ver
the 009. I still carry the 009 in the spares kit. It's all set up with po=
ints
and condenser just in case. In a pinch I know I can make her run well eno=
ugh
to get home.

Aircooled_dot_net has gotten good reviews from
listmembers. =


Thought the aircooled_dot_net guy said it's for type
1 engine only.  I assume that means insufficient
advance...
