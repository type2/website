Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Relief Tool

&gt;From: &quot;Phil Trenholme&quot; Desk looks like another Civil Engineer/Land 
&gt;Developer destroying the environment:&gt;) I worked 41 years in the Santa 
&gt;Clara valley and played a major role in razing many orchards and paving 
&gt;many square miles with concrete and asphalt.
&gt;Phil :&gt;)

&gt;Think the tool is called a drag link socket


Yep you are correct on both accounts. That is what it is called. I am a 
Civil Engineer but work as a Construction Project Manager for a site 
developement company. I hate my boss has a dream of paving the planet &quot;Make 
'er Black&quot;, he says. I myself will turn down a McDonald's or Clear Cut 
Subdivision bid everytime they hit my desk just because of what they do to 
the environment. He is coming around to the whole &quot;Green&quot; attitude of 
building. I have him interested in a Pinetar Emulsion Pavement Mix that goes 
down basically the same as asphalt, but lasts longer and is more eco 
friendly than a paper napkin, well when you look at the product and not the 
placement. You still have to place it with diesel powered equipment. But I 
am trying to talk him into converting one of the older pieces of equipment 
to Veggie Fuel. &quot;People could pay you to take fuel, your equipment runs for 
free and get a tax credit.

&quot; You can't teach an old dog new tricks, but can you trick him to learn them 
himself&quot;. MTK
