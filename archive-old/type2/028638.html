Tyler,

I have a 1979 Westy Automatic.
I'd like to help but sort of having the same problem.

I don't think it's the breaker points. They are either working or not at
all.
That screw you speak of is loose in my dist. also.
JB weld is an OK idea maybe a little silicone is less permanent.


Try this as a solution:

At idle, I have to set my timing to 20 to 25 degrees(to the left of the ZERO
mark) = 20 BTDC.
After locking the parking break, I put the bus in Drive.  The idle now drops
and I re-adjust timing to 7.5 BTDC or more to
Attain a proper 900 RPM. (Can any one confirm this?)

Do you have a manual transmission? If so then, I would just set the timing
20 to 25 BTDC and see if it runs better.
My car still runs a little weird and I am still trying to find the best
(HOT) valve adjustment.

I read today that the timing at idle should be set like this:

&quot;Two suggestions Will. First, check to see if it is advancing too far.
Connect your
timing light and tach/dwell, and see what the advance is at 3300 RPMs when
the
engine is warm. It should be 28-30 degrees advance max.&quot; - David and Anna
