Subject: Re: [T2] Snake oil cooling info???

&gt; I browsed this article but didn't read it yet. I got a little nervous about the advise because putting anything in the way of the suction side of the oil pump can have possible side effects. the pickup tube on an automotive oil pump is purposely short. The type of pump used in automotive applications is designed to produce pressure and hopefully volume
&gt; on the output side of the pump. It is not designed as a very efficient vacuum. I am suspicious that as the filter does its job of getting clogged with debris from the oil, some restriction would be applied to the intake of the oil pump. The article did point out that there is a bypass built into the filter to allow oil around the filter if it should get
&gt; clogged. The problem is the bypass of every filter I have seen depends on pressure differential overcoming spring pressure to open the bypass. My concern is that before the differential is great enough to open the bypass valve, it may be great enough to effect the output of the oil pump.
&gt;
&gt; Keep in mind that it is highly recommended to prime a new oil pump with oil while installing it. This is because the design of the pump does not lend itself to sucking oil from the sump with efficiency. The fear is that an air filled pump may not produce any output pressure before the engine starts. I suspect that as the filter in the sump collects
&gt; debris it may restrict the intake and reduce the output oil pressure or worse yet cause cavitation in the pump and permanently damage the pump.
&gt;
&gt; I would recommend getting a standard deep sump and a full flow oil cooler if you are concerned about oil cooling/cleaning. The additional quantity of oil provided by this small sump is a pittance compared to what you will get from a normal deep sump. Putting a filter on the pressure side of the oil pump is the way to go to prevent oil starvation,
&gt; cavitation, and pressure problems.
&gt;
&gt; One quick example of the problems associated with the sump filter. Imagine the difference sucking your favorite drink up a standard straw versus a tiny swizzle stick straw ( like a coffee stirrer straw). The regular straw draws a larger quantity with less effort.
&gt;
&gt; I hope my explanation is understandable. Physics says filter the pressure side not the suction side.
&gt; Hope this helps and if someone disagrees please be gentle. this is my first time posting a technical opinion to the list.
