Hi Volks!

&gt;Does anyone have a URL for a site that lists all models of VW's,

&gt;what years had diesel engines --- asked on the vw-diesel and vanagon
&gt;lists, but got no response.

&gt;I've only heard of diesels c. 1982-83 but what do I know...

Well, they *made* Diesel versions of the Golf (Rabbit) and Passat
(Dasher) from ca. mid-70s on, of the Bus/Transporter (Vanagon) from 
1982 on, of the Polo from ca. late 80s on, and of all models since 
introduced.  The question you seem to be asking though (I presume),
namely which ones got imported into the US, I am not fit to answer.

Today you can buy a Diesel engine in any Volkswagen model, including
the Eurovan, just like in any Audi model except the TT.  Sorry if you
you didn't really want to know that.  :-)

About the T vs. Type thing: well, poke all the fun at me that you
wish but I will keep pestering you in regular intervals.  And nope,
I am not offended.  Try harder.  ;-)))

Airhowlingly yours,
