I will add, primer will not seal the metal. It is the top coat enamel 
that does the sealing. If it has had only primer on it through only a 
few days of humidity, expect problems if you don't remove the primer, 
then use a metal prep to condition and seal the metal. So sad that 
your efforts are for naught. I must also suggest that acid dipping 
for a unibody chassis is a problem. It is impossible to remove the 
acid from the seams or neutralize it all. Within months to a very few 
years of repainting, expect paint failure at the seams and rust in 
there that you can never get out.

&gt;Hey Seth --
&gt;              I wish someone had told you about the rattle can stuff,
&gt;considering you went to the work plus $$$ expense of dip-and-strip.  In my
&gt;experience, automotive primers/paints do not adhere well (if at all) when
&gt;applied over rattle can primer.  Rust-Oleum is bad news in that regard.
