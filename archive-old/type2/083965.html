Subject: Re: [T2] More vac from a prog?

Clark,

There is enough vacuum from a Progressive to run your stock
distributor.  I have a Progressive on my bus (PO); over the weekend I
pitched the 009 (PO again) and replaced it with a dual vacuum
distributor (with thanks to Karl).  Much better low-end pull; no more
hesitation off the start.  A good outcome from a carburetor that
'sucks'.  (pun intended)

&gt; So, the question stands:  does the progressive throttle body vacuum port
&gt; *allow the engine* to pull enough vacuum pressure to actuate the diaphrag=
&gt; m in
&gt; a stock (74-75 bus) dual vac distributor?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
