&gt; A fellow came to my work place today. He heard I was the local &quot;Bus guy&quot; and
&gt; needed help. He is stranded just across the state line in North Carolina.
&gt; 
&gt; History: He was up here many months ago and fried the points somehow. No
&gt; parts available and had to leave the bus and hitch home. He now is back and
&gt; has replaced the points and she idles fine but (his description) &quot;bucks and
&gt; sputters&quot; at anything above 20-25 miles per hour. Who knows how the points
&gt; were set.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds fuel related? Anyway, if it aint a 1600 upright, I am not much help.
&gt; Know nothing about FI. Supossed to be a stock setup. Might be coil related?
&gt; My 71 did something like that once. Will one of my coils work?
&gt; 
&gt; At any rate, am going to drive over the mountain in the morning and drive it
&gt; so may be able to give a better description tomorrow. Anything obvious to
&gt; check? Please if you respond with any FI stuff, tell me how to check and
&gt; where it is! :-) It will have to be obvious or he will remain sitting.
&gt; 
&gt; Just trying to help another brother bus owner.
&gt; 
&gt; Marv, wanna come help?

Ric:
The points HAVE to be right to have the right timing. A person could
eyeball the point gap to within .005 inch, but that could be a
difference of 15 degress in the timing. The points also have to function
for the FI to work. Well, it's obviously functioning. 
Take a dwell meter (or feeler guage) and a timing lite, that'll fix 90%
of the problems.
