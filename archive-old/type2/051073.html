 No, mine are doing fine.  Recently had the honor of assisting a fellow buser 
 with a brake job.  He was having problems stopping and his e-brake wasn't 
 working a-tall.  After procuring the correct cables and the the wrong brake 
 shoes from an establishment that posts often to the lists we proceeded with 
 the operation.  &gt;&gt;
was it a 63 wit the optional big brakes?   shops often get that wrong.  cool 
that you found what the DPO did.

I am having brake woes with my 65 westy.  pulls to left.    new MC last 
spring.  rebuildt all wheel cyls and new front shoes about a year ago.  no 
leaks in front.  took off the front hoses to double check them- there were 
clear (new a few years ago).   drums look okay but I am thinking of getting 
them turned.  the right front wheel makes a scraping  noise as I push the 
pedal down lightly as the drums rubs the shoe it sound like (not metal 
squeeking)   the sound started happening a couple days before the pulling 
did.   I took off the drums, all looking great in both fronts.  peel back the 
dust covers and the cyls are not leaky.  had a friend press the brake pedal 
and I watched the pistons push out, and then snap back when he released.  
like they oughta.  lying underneath I can reach the brake lever with one hand 
and spin the tire with another (when it is jacked up) and it seems the right 
wheel just doesnt stop so good.   which makes sense with it pulling left.  
anyone had this?  I know some people swear by drum turning, but I would 
rather not take more metal off the drums unless it really needs it.   no big 
grooves.   I use 80 grit sandpaper in the drums perpendicular to the 
direction of spin to break any glaze. hm what are the specs on min thickness?

it is confusing cause when there is a brake woe, I am used to it being 
obvious what the problem is (seeing something leak, worn shoes, no fluid 
coming through, etc.)
