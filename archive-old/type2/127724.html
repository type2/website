Subject: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

&gt;Nobody stocks new 50/50 or &quot;safare&quot; windows,
commonly refered to as jalousie windows. 

The Captain contemplates how much fabrication
would be required to put jalousie windows in the
drivers and passenger door of a 76 bus.... but
then decides just to have a few chips.
