we're only 6 with the addition of the mother-in-law and my niece, so
we're covered at the moment.  i'm sure i made all the mother-in-law
comments that you guys can think up, and in the end the wife won and i
did finally bolt the middle seat in :)  2 bolts will hold it right?  the
other 4 are spares?

muwahahahahah
