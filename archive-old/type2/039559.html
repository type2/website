Subject: Re: need '79 sliding door interior handle

I bought one from the Motorworks catalog.  Rocky Mountain Motorworks in
Colorado.  I'll bet you can get one from busdepot_dot_com as well.

Before I replaced mine, the PO had a pair of Vice-Grip pliers she was using
as a handle.  It wasn't pretty but it works.  And I was able to put a new
tool in my toolbox after buying the bus and replacing the handle.  Bonus!

Subject: need '79 sliding door interior handle


&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; I'm missing the interior handle for the sliding door on my '79 bus. More
&gt; accurately, I'm missing about one third or so of my handle (the remaining
&gt; two thirds was in pieces on the floor when I bought the bus).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, if someone has a spare handle I'd happily be willing to purchase
it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
