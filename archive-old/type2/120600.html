Subject: paging Brandy

Pardon the bandwith:
Brandy call me at 503-772-2119. Lost your number.

Bus content:
Replanced rear break shoes (and wheel cylanders). Got
two new toys: 2 1/2 ton SUV (hi lift) jack
w/jackstands, and a brake bleader. The jack/stands
were great, the bleader less so. I really enjoyed
feeling safer while working on the wheels w/ the
stands and the jack is very usetr friendly (besides
the weight). The bleeder is the kind that sucks fluid
out the end, and I pumped 4 oz of fluid through each
cylander and they still feel mushy.
