Subject: '71 windshield

I replaced my windshield this summer, but I had professionals deal with all
the window installations.  The one key though is that we had to go through
3 windshields to get one that fit, and that final one only fit because the
professionals cut about a quarter of an inch off of each side.  Otherwise,
they would break, which is what happened with the first two from RMM.  Good
luck.  Dallas
