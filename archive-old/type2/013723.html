Dear friends, Well, its been an interesting trip so
far. I am now in Ashland, Oregon. I have had my share
of hassels with my bus but the experiences have taught
me so much about her inner workings. I can remember
the first time I contacted you folks about the
possibility of becoming a type 2 owner. I was gun shy.
The engine looked like a huge monster in a cave. There
were wires hanging everywhere, and strange noises,
and... Things don't look so ominous now. I have been
over that bus from the wheel to the exhaust (rooter to
the tooter). I think shes running fairly well.
Yesterday I changed out the cylinder head temp sensor.
I had to fabricate a special socket to do the job. I
found a deep well 13 mm and sliced a groove for the
wire. Worked well. Its so incredible how much help I
have been blessed with along the trail. To different
shops here in Ashland have been lending there advice
and shop space. I am doing the work. I had to tweek
the air flow sensor (This had been done previously in
Boulder by a certified mechanic). The top of the box
was loose. She was idling poorly but when I moved the
arm in the air box she mellowed out. I adjusted the
black notched wheel till she purred. I have more power
and the idle is good. I had to replace the directional
switch yesterday as well. I contacted my good friend
Joe at BustedVW. He had one out for me right away. Joe
has been such a great asset in this journey. While in
Boulder we became good friends. I value his enthusiasm
and dedication. He has almost any part you may need
for your bus. He will clean the part (often paints it)
and send it out immediately. He can be found on the
web at BustedVW_dot_com. Check him out for those hard to
find parts. Thanks Joe. I also want to say thanks to
the many other friends I have made here on the list -
THANKS! Your all fantastic!
