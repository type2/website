Subject: distributor smoke!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Everybody,
 
I have a 71 volkwagen bus, just got done tearing the
engine completley down to replace a weber carbrator
with a stock solex.  
   when I went to start the engine it cranked but
never turned over, I went back and saw smoke coming
from my distributor!  looked inside and the insulated
cable was fried.  what happened?
I realize that I will need to replace the distributor
but I don't want the same thing to happen with the new
one.  Any Ideas?
            Nick Moran
