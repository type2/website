&gt; &gt; Prices may be steep, but everything comes with a lifetime
&gt; &gt; warranty, which I am unable to find elsewhere....

And if you buy something in California with a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot;, unless it
specifies an exact length of time, it is 7 years. Not the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the
part, not the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the original purchaser! California law says a
&quot;lifetime&quot; is 7 years. This was passed into law here sometime in early
2000.[?]
