&lt;&lt; 've a 1600 DP bus that has a leaking extractors....real bad.The studs and 
 nuts holding them to the engine barrel are rusted and removal is impossible 
 with proper tools. WD-40 didn't work too. What can I do? &gt;&gt;

contrary to popular belief...wd-40 is not a penetrant. (it may free an 
occasional nut, but its purpose is not to penetrate rusted nuts/bolts).  wd 
actually stands for water deterent.  which is why if off roading, and your 
engine stalls after going thru a large puddle, you can spray wd-40 on and 
around your distrib.,coil, wires, etc. , it will *dry * them and allow you to 
start your vehicle.  either try a REAL penetrating oil (spray it on and let 
it sit awhile) or ask the list members for a description of the *hot wax 
trick*...i'd try to explain it but i have yet to personally try it and would 
probably leave an important step.  have fun....
