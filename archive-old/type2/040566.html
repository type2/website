Travis,
I don't have first-hand experience what you have described, but archival 
posts have pointed out the possibility that the pointer which is attached to 
the air flow monitor's moveable flap may be sweeping over a track which has 
developed poor electrical contact over the years, which results in a 
momentary loss of signal to the ecu.  The fix was to bend the pointer so it 
moved over a slightly new track on the electrically conductive surface. 
Others with more FI knowledge may suggest something else, but that is one 
possiblity to look into.
