&gt; &gt;I would not expect clearance problems unless you get
&gt; &gt;_way_ off of the beaten path.  Mexican topes (and bordos) are
&gt; &gt;certainly attention-getters, but they are seldom more than 3 inches
&gt; &gt;tall.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not so much the roads that are horrible so much as the
livestock in
&gt; them...
&gt; 
&gt; Traveling in Chihuahua state (well off the beaten path but not way
off) we
&gt; had a lot of trouble with these huge rural concrete drainage
ditches. They
&gt; are just as meticulous about marking these as they are about marking
all
&gt; the other hazards. 8)

Yes, there seems to be a different philosophy about marking hazards in
the land south of the border!

A Mexican friend put it this way:

In the US, if you have a crack in the sidewalk in front of your house
and someone trips over it they hire a lawyer, take you to court, and
extracts several thousand dollars from you, most of which goes to the
lawyer.

In Mexico, if you have a crack in the sidewalk in front of your house
and someone trips over it they say &quot;Darn, I should have been watching
where I was going!&quot;

The second philosophy seems to be the saner to me.

It's true that you have to be more careful in Mexico, as they don't
tend to put up a lot of signs.  The idea is that you shouldn't be
going so fast that you cannot see the hazard.  I tend to keep the
speeds down in Mexico, especially when I have just crossed the border
and I'm not used to the conditions yet.

Cattle are an obvious hazard, and for this reason I _never_ drive at
night anywhere there is open range, including in the US.  I've found
that US cows are just as black at night as Mexican cows!  After seeing
what a cow strike did to a Dodge Ram Diesel Road Tank I don't even
want to think of the damage to the bus and me from hitting one.

Vacation is a good time to slow down and enjoy the scenery.

Don't get me started on Mexican buses... Tres Estrellas de VOOOOOMMMMM!
