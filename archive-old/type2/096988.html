Subject: Flywheel Assembly Balance

The archives have left me with the impression that having the flywheel
assembly balanced is generally good...

Background:  Rebuilt '77 2.0L.  Flywheel is on, but I forgot to mark the
original position of the pressure plate when I removed it.  The pressure
plate and clutch disk are in very good condition, so they're being reused.

Situation:  The flywheel has no asymetrical markings which might be a
balance mark, except for a tiny stamped letter &quot;H&quot; on the inner
(non-surfaced) face.  The Sachs pressure plate has two white paint marks.
One is a big blob, the other looks like a sideways number 8 with a capital
&quot;T&quot; superimposed.

Question(s):  Are these marks possibly balance marks?  If so, how should
thay be aligned relative to each other?  If I can't determine the original
alignment do I need to remove the flywheel and get them both balanced?  If I
just bolt the thing up as-is, would a lack of unusual engine vibration
indicate that the balance condition is acceptable?

One other...do I need to check end-play when re-installing the original
flywheel? I don't own the tool.


Any thoughts appreciated...
