Subject: Re: [T2] Shredded Hoses

go to your local hardware store and buy some cheap hose that's
relatively easy to cut/slit lenthwise.  That clear hose that has a 3/8&quot;
opening would probably work fine.  You don't want hose with a huge
diameter because then it won't bend around the curves easily.  Try a few
different sizes.

I had to do this for an opening I cut into the engine bay.  All I had
on-hand was fuel line, but that's a waste of money to be using
high-pressure hose to make a hole grommet.  It's not the prettiest thing
in the world, but hey, it works and nobody's gonna see it anyways ;)

&gt; 
&gt; What kind of hose?? Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can slice some hose lengthwise and use that as a grommet (is that
&gt; &gt; the right word?) around the opening.  That should protect the hose
&gt; &gt; nicely.
