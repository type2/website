I now ALWAYS replace the brake hoses.

Basically if i didnt install them i assume they are 20 years old and
blocked or about to rupture.

At less than $6 each, there is barely any reson not to.  Unless you have
upgraded or have a 67 with dual circuit, you will loose ALL brakes if any
part of the system fails.

There are plenty of places to cut corners in a bus, but brakes isnt one of
them.

take care,
