Subject: Re: [T2] Not likely.....and ramblings..Re: [T2] Re: Can a bus
  tow a Geo  Metro?

Enough of the scare stories.  Britt Grannis (remember Britt?) has hauled 
buses back and forth across the country using the Roadcow.  I don't know 
if I'd recognize Roadcow without another bus hooked to the ass end. It 
can be done. Just keep your thinking cap on and realize that you're 
going to wear your bus out faster.

What's Roadcow you ask?  Google it. Only the most famous bus on the net.
