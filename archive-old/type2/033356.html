Subject: '71 Westy luggage rack seal

I'd like to install a luggage rack seal of the 74 + variety on my '71 to 
finish off my poptop resto.  What mods are involved?  I've read it could 
cause drainage issues, since it didn't come with one stock.  I've ben 
kickin'around in the archives for over a year now, and have gotten tons of 
info on my resto here - thanks.  Finally able to join list.
Thanks

Don J
