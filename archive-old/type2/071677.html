Subject: oil light flickers on
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, djspn2_at_hotmail_dot_com

Logic sequence: If the oil light flickers on/off or, worse, comes on and 
stays on while the engine is running at all, then you are (obviously) losing 
(or not creating) oil pressure somewhere. Oil pressure in the VW is only 
maintained for a short travel from the oil pump to the crankcase. If there is 
oil in the engine, if the pump works (it usually does -- it's very reliable) 
and there are no major leaks between the pump and the case, then the next 
logical place, and the normal place where the engine loses oil pressure, is 
at the big crankshaft journal holes. Loose case nuts create the same symptom, 
but then the case leaks and the engine pounds like a drum.

When the main bearings start to break down, when they lose metal shavings 
like those described earlier, the effective size of hole the oil is forced 
through at the big bearing journals increases, and the oil pressure 
decreases. As if this in itself weren't bad enough, the engine is then prone 
to overheating at the cylinders and heads because oil is a big part of 
cooling in the VW, and less oil is being splashed and sprayed up there where 
it's needed.

The vw engine can take an amazing amount of abuse, though. One of mine ran 
for no less than 30K, including three cross-country trips, with the oil light 
flickering on at every stop light after a long run. Finally the heads went. 

So what you do is decide you need to rebuild the bottom end eventually, and 
manage life and moohlah so's you can do this. The sooner you do it, the less 
likely you are to need hundreds of dollars of pots and heads as well as the 
fourty or so dollars of main and rod bearings and eighty dollars of gaskets 
it takes to rebuild the case. A good home-done bottom end rebuild is better 
than most shop rebuilds, and I recommend it if your engine is original. A bad 
home-done bottom end rebuild is a huge waste of time and money. The 
occasional type II commercial rebuild lasts for more than 60K. You get what 
you pay for.

And yes, I teach college, so long winded dissertations come naturally to me. S
orry.

Good luck.
Mick
