Subject: Re: Tom Noble Engines in seattle

My guess is that he sold that property for a profit and moved.

Is that address anywhere near your?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I put a Tom Noble engine in my bus soon after I bought it in 1989, and it
&gt; went strong for 120K.  When I needed to replace the engine last year, I
&gt; tried to find Tom Noble, but I was told he was no longer in business.  Too
&gt; bad.  He did nice work.
&gt;


I drove by there yesterday,  I am sure I could go into the safeway that is
there now and find someone who knows someone with an aircooled VW, but I
doubt they would be much help :-)

Sounds like the engine is a winner,  I guess the only thing that is
concerning me at this point is the fact that I have all the reciepts but no
idea what would have possesed someone to replace the engine.  I have a
reciept for work done in 92 which shows that the original engine was a
1700.  Compression was 140/140/140/130 which IIRC is pretty darn good.  The
ODO reading was 31397 and the work was done by Fat City.

The Tom Noble paperwork is dated 5/95, and states remanufactured longblock
to fit/1975 VW bus STD Trans/Serial Number/Build to 2.0 liter/solid lifter.
I know what most of this means, now I was told by the PO that it has Mark
Stephen Phase 1 Heads but not sure what this means exactly and I am trying
to figure out if Tom Noble did the work or one of the previous owners did
since I seem to have an oil leak that I am trying to track down.   Seems to
be mostly on the right side...but its hard to tell.   Might be the oil
breather seal, distributor seal or pushrod seals.  Might even be the oil
cooler.

At any rate, thanks for the info everyone.  Looks like my bus really only
does have 41k miles on it.
