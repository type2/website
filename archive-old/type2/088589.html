Subject: [T2] PS-  Lugless engine into Bus

By the way, it's a 1970 bus.
Hi all, I was wondering if there is some way to put one of these engines
without the mounting lugs molded into its rear into the bus.  I have managed
to get not one but two rebuilt examples of these. I put one in there and it
wasn't until I grabbed the cross member to install it that I realized what
I'd done.  Boy is that ever a heartbreaker, it fit right in there just right
too.  I think maybe if I get the mounting pieces from whatever VW this came
out of and chop them up then maybe I can weld soemthing together to make it
all work.  Glen Ward
