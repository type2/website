Subject: Re: Evaporative engine cooling

I've been toying with the idea of running a small water line from my water tank
inside the campmobile to the engine compartment.  Mounted somewhere in the line
would be an after marke windshield washer pump.  In the engine compartment
would be one of those mister nozzles that are sold in kits for cooling off
large outside areas.  If I remember correctly these nozzles pass about 3
gallons per hour.  These nozzles create a very fine mist that would insure no
areas in the engine compartment get totally wet.  Anyway, I imagine that on a
100 degree day that wouldn't be a problem anyway.  If mounted correctly, the
fan would probably suck all the mist through the cooling system.  Would this
nozzle pass enough water to effect a 20 degree drop in temperature?  I'm also
not sure if the windshield washer pump would create enough pressure to mist the
water at the nozzle.  If I can find the misting system this time of year I'll
conduct a test and let everyone know.
