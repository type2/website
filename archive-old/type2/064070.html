&gt; Not to mention that the most spectacular parts of Texas are hidden; it's

Roy brings up an excellent point, and one of the main reasons I try to 
avoid interstates (even paved roads when I can--ask the long-suffering 
Inuvik people about the consequences of this...) whenever we travel for 
fun.

I used to hate driving across South Dakota, since we'd always drive the 
I-90 corridor, where the only halfway interesting things are the Badlands 
and Wall Drug (hoping to get some flaming from SD folks here...).  Last 
time through, we couldn't avoid I-90 entirely, but where we did break off 
we had a great time.

Good route #1: In the past I'd driven I-35 up to meet I-90, then spend 
all day pointed west on the interminable I-90.  This time, we broke off 
right after the Missouri R peeled off to the west, heading west through 
southern SD following the escarpment of the Missouri River valley in what 
is really very, very nice country!  We worked our way up west then 
North, then west, and so forth, holding off I-90 as long as we could.
Great place names, too, like &quot;Gayville.&quot;  Certain words have changed 
meaning in the last 100 years, so they now have a wonderful HUGE sign at 
the entrance to the sign &quot;Welcome to Gayville&quot;--even the design of the 
sign is naively campy.  Fabulous!  I would have stopped to get a picture 
for my cousin and for Ron, but it was pouring rain.  :-(  Countryside 
looked particularly dramatic as we were driving in massive electrical 
storms for a couple of hours, including at least a dozen strikes within 
1/4 mile of us.  Intense driving, man!

Good route #2:  This one is great for VW bus drivers, since it actually 
cuts about 100 miles off the usual I-90 Rapid City - Billings run, where 
the bus wouldn't be running that fast anyway.  Westbound, head N from 
Rapid City to Belle Fourche, then W on US Hwy 212(?) to pick up I-90 
again at Crow Agency, MT.  Very nice country, and liitle traffic on the 
roads--but watch for crosswinds on the plains near Belle Fourche and 
west across the tiny bit of Wyoming!

Just my CDN$0.02,

Tobin
