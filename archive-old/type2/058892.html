Subject: Re: Hoover's bulkhead fitting

Whoops, no. I had given a URl where you could uncover all the messages
pertaining to Hoover's bulkhead fitting but I was not right.

I cannot find the original in the archive despite about an hour of poking.
The reason for its absence is a mystery but I'm pretty sure it is not there
at all. I hope Bob isn't upset with me for this but the URL of the original
article is here, this appears to be the only place it exists:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/sermons/_liturgy/engine_fires.html

For more illumination go back to &quot;complex search&quot; and key in &quot;bulkhead AND
fitting&quot;.
