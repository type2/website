Dear Steven.

Thanks for your e-mail regarding the oil-temperature gauge sender unit 
thread size being M14 x 1.0mm and its part number.

Which engine type (1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2 or 1980~83 VW 2000 Vanagon) 
have you installed it on and what modification if any, had to be made to the 
oil dipstick, to prevent it fouling the sender?

For the VW 411LE Variant engine, in my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, I suspect that 
some shortening of the dipstick would be necessary. I too might be 
interested in obtaining one of these Porsche 914 engine plates, with 
oil-temperature sender fitting boss.

However, I am currently waiting to see whether I can obtain from an 
acquaintance of mine in Great Britain, a 220V AC mains, oil sump heater, 
which replaces the standard plate.

Looking at your pictures of the oil-pressure gauge-sender installation, 
without any spacer mast or adapters, I wondered how you screwed it into the 
crankcase, suffiently tightly, to get a leak-free seal and prevent the 
sender unscrewing itself. Did you first have to remove the inlet manifold 
pipes and the large cover-plate, which covers cylinders 3 &amp; 4?

I tried out your method of installation, using some old junk cover plates, 
requiring an enlarged hole of &gt;43mm diameter, but rejected this method in 
favour of the spacer mast and banjo fittings.

The problems I identified, were those of sealing around the hole in the 
cover plate and the inconvenience of removing the inlet manifold and cover 
plate, in order to remove or replace the sender.

Regards.
         Nigel A. Skeet
