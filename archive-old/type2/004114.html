Folks have been known to carry the disposable propane cylinders outside, on
the luggage rack, inside an inexpensive cooler.  This should give some
protection from temperature extremes.

An alternative is to use a small bulk tank.  Even a  5 lb.. tank will last
for a week or two, depending on how the stove is used, and the fuel is less
expensive purchased in bulk.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I am trying to figure out the best way to handle the cylinders for my
propane portable stove.

The instructions say not to subject the cylinders to high temperatures or
store in areas used for habitation.

Well, I looked at the alternatives, and they were not great either. The
liquid fuel fired one can spill, at least
I can perhaps secure this one in a cabinet or something where it will be
safe.

I am refering to the 1lb Propane canisters.

Looks like the safest alternative to me.

Of course I would never use the stove in the camper, the problem is the
transportation of the fuel in my
westie.  &lt;&lt;
