Subject: automatic, 1st gear
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.10106291037190.3956-100000_at_kiss&gt;

Hello all -

I'm new to the list, and am expecting to own a '73 aircooled bus, which I
gather is a transporter and not a westy, though I'm not entirely clear on
what each entails (any pointers to bus faqs or tech info pages welcome).

Anyways, it's an automatic, and the guy I'm buying it from says that it
doesn't go into 1st gear when you have it in drive, but you can get it
into 1st by putting the tranny in a lower gear manually.  He says a
mechanic told him there's a switch on the tranny that controls that that
needs to be replaced.  Anyone know if this is true, whether it's easy and
cheap, and whether it's worth the trouble?  I drove it a bit, and it
seemed to get going reasonably well (at least, for a bus:)

Jeff
