Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA supports AIR cooled community

Hi Volks,

I got an email yesterday from VWOA. It was to informing me of the
&quot;Enthusiast Licensing Program&quot;. The email told me:

&gt; The Internet Licensing Program is a free program and offers VW Clubs 
&gt; and Enthusiasts the opportunity to apply for a license to use 
&gt; Volkswagen trademarks and service marks on the Internet and in 
&gt; Internet domain names if certain conditions are met.

&gt; If you are a Club or Enthusiast and have any intention of using 
&gt; or are currently using any Volkswagen trademarks, you must
&gt; apply for a trademark license. If you are currently using Volkswagen 
&gt; trademarks on the Internet or in a domain name, this email does not 
&gt; constitute any agreement or acknowledgment that your uses adhere or 
&gt; conform to the Licensing Agreement. The Licensing Application Process 
&gt; will describe the program in detail. We look forward to hearing from
&gt; you
&gt; and to your participation in this program. Once you are licensed, you
&gt; will 
&gt; obtain benefits only available to licensees such as listing your Club 
&gt; Events on Volkswagen of America's Club Event Calendar. 

So in exchange for 20 minutes of tedious forms-filing, I get to list my
event (Buses Of the Corn) on their web calendar. Not gonna happen. Last
year I listed BOTC with VW_dot_com and it only took about 90 seconds.

In my response I told them that it was too much trouble and that they
were spending too much energy on copyright infringement instead of
supporting the enthusiasts. I expect other event planners will boycott
the VW_dot_com event calendar for the same reason; unless you're already
required to acknowledge a VW copyright it just isn't worth the hassle.

But now this.... Is VW actually turning the ship in a new direction?

Like George said... I'll wait and see if they rein in the lawyers
before I consider this battle over and done with.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; but I got a letter today from VWoA,  really nice VW letterhead and
&gt;&gt; envelope.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; it was a promotion for the Michigan VW Club annual event which VWoA is
&gt;&gt; getting involved with.
&gt;
&gt; Me too. I was impressed that it was on VW stationary.
