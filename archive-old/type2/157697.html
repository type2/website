&gt; The subaru engine mount bolted on the trans end, one bolt in the bell

You might get some inspriation from the Smallcar mount for the vanagon.
It bolts to four locations on the bottom of the engine and extends
rearward to accept the standard moustache bar.  It won't work in the Bay,
but the same idea might be applied to provide a rear mount.

Scroll down to see the mount.
