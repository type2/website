Hello everyone. Some of you will remeber me as the guy who came on a couple
months ago knowing nothing about busses, not a lot about engines in general
and expecting to do a complete rebuild on a '72 on three weeks and $500.
Well needless to say I learned that I was crazy.

So now I've settled on spending a good portion of my time on trying to get
it done in four months. I'm taking pictures all the way, when I get done
I'll write a guide &quot;by an idiot for an idiot&quot;. I got the engine pulled (and
almost dropped it on my foot when one of the jacks tipped... don't worry, I
didn't let it fall). I've got most of the paint stripped from the engine
compartment in preparation to painting it (a little surface rust and lots
of gunk). Noticed that the CV joints have half the bus-style screws and
half the Porche style ones. I've also got the engine halfway stripped.
Remeber that I have no idea how long since last rebuild. 

The heads, to my untrained eye, look very nice. No dropped seats, no play
in the valves, no cracks, ect. Depending on how money looks two months from
now and the opinion of my machinist I'll either just get the heads cleaned
up or get two new heads from MSHP. If I'm gonna do it I might as well do it
right. By the way, neither Muir or the Haynes manual mention that you have
to unscrew the heat deflector (I think... it's a peice of sheet metal that
screws to the head and the case) before pulling the heads. 

The pistons and cyls look surprisingly good, but some of the fins are
slightly bent (not my doing...) and there is a wee-tiny bit of scoring on
the cyl walls of one cyl. So I've settled on new P&amp;Cs, considering they're
not unbelievably expensive. 
Now as for the bottom end, I haven't cracked the case yet, I'm waiting for
another full day that's not already called for. I found, however, when
removing the flywheel, that the engine will not rotate, and appears to be
locked up (CTRL-ALT-DEL didn't help either...) YES, I should have noticed
much sooner. With the heads off I could get the pistons to move about half
an inch each and then they stop. So I'm assuming a thrown rod or something
equally hideous. I hope I can save the case, I'm already calculating for
all new rods, cam, and crank, aside from bearings etc. 

So the plan is to strip everything down including interior (needs some
paint) and rewire (M-I-C.... K-E-Y-....) as well as all the other odd stuff
best done with the engine out, do the engine work, and have the engine
broken &amp; all the kinks worked out in time to move north in the spring. I'll
be living in it for a month or so untill I save up some money from my new
job, so I HOPE it runs : ) If nothing else, I'll tow it up and park it. 

Okay, on to questions. 

What do I need to do to upgrade to an 1800, since (unless I'm confused)
they use the same case? Suppose I put the larger P&amp;Cs in, would I need/want
different crank and cam? Heads? Since I'm replacing all that stuff
anyway... what other things would I have to replace? What about hydraulic
lifters? Do I just need lifters and camshaft?

Oil cooler... this one doesn't have any major leaks showing and is clean
and solid-looking, but I understand that metal particles can get caught up
and cause another engine failure. Is there a reasonably sure way to
clean/test it? The replacement is a little bit expensive... 


Paint. I'm painting all the sheet metal... is it necisarry to use
high-temp paint? If I can find a cheap powder coating place, I might, but
I'm not exactly made of money. 

Fuel pump. This car came with an electric fuel pump mounted above the front
of the engine, middleish. Isn't a '72 supposed to have a mechanical pump?
I'm a little confused, 72 being kindof a border year and all.

Electrical. I'm sure I can handle all the rewiring for the existing stuff,
that's easy enough, so long as I remember to keep track of everything and
consult my handy witing diagram. I plan to install a second battery (for my
three stereo amps totalling 1000 watts... gonna be about the loudest bus
around) but I'm also thinking about eventually setting it up for 110-volt
so I can plug in my TV and all that fun stuff. The hardware is out there
and available, but what are the legal considerations for this? And the
practical considerations? 

Alternator. Anyone know of a high-power alternator for a bus? All that
electronics is bound to end up being too much for the stock one. 

Water. I need to find a water tank. Is this a junk-yard-only part or can I
get one from busdepot or a camper supplier?

Pop-top. I'm a little confused about my pop-top. It's 4-sided (raises
straight up evenly, all four corners) most of the ones I've seen pictured
are slanted forward. Is this an aftermarket replacement?

Okay, that should be enough to keep me busy for a while. Thanks everyone!
