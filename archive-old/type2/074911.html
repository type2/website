Sorry to hear it. I think your assessment is correct. Can't be fixed
without teardown. Might or might not last who knows how long. You just have
to bite the bullet and scrounge the bucks to budget a motor R&amp;R. I would
consider sending the GEX in as a core to a proper rebuilder for a long
block sitting ready on the shelf. Who knows what else is GEXed up in there. 

Consider NW Connecting Rod, Seattle. The have the right equipment and
skills to reweld cracked aluminum properly. Every remanufactured long
block/short block/head/flywheel they have sent me has been just gorgeous,
with no comebacks at all. As well, they have 2 generations of VW
experience, and do VW motors only, air or water cooled, gas or diesel.

&gt;went out this morning to do a regular oil/filter change.  pulled the nut
&gt;off the strainer and drained the oil. looked ok, looked at strainer and
&gt;there were two good sized hunks  of metal, knew instantly what they were..
&gt;  they were curved and sort of triangular.  and had threads on the inside,
&gt;it was part of the boss that holds the oil strainer stud..
