&gt; Ok. I'm done now.

yep, so go get drunk or whatever, take a week off

&gt; I made the effort, tried to make this bus worthy of my family, to no
&gt; avail. I've put way too much $$ and time into it with nothing to show.
&gt; I've taken too many days that should have been spent with my family
&gt; and dumped them into this bus.

take your wife out to dinner or have pizza delivered.
&gt;
&gt; Plus, with my wife having Lupus (sp?) and not working, I don't have
&gt; the funds to keep going.

sounds like you have most of what you need, and your wife is probably
looking forward to cruising in the bus

&gt; AND the jackstand that was under the jack point. I WAS UNDER THE BUS
&gt; WHEN THIS HAPPENED!!! I had just popped my head out of the wheel well

thank the god you believe in and consider it a sign from your bus that it
likes you, but want's you to take a break

&gt; So. The first person at my door with $500 can have the 73. I'll

nah, more than that if you have to.

&gt; Maybe life will deal me another bus in the future when I can afford
&gt; the time/$$. I really love the bus and the community, but the
&gt; trade-off just isn't worth it at this point in my life.

so slow down work on it as the spirt moves you but I really think you'll
regret any rash sale.

hang in there
Bob
