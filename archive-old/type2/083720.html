&gt; Well, after getting the engine in my 69, I realized my throttle cable
was not put in beforehand.  Seems to be 2 holes in my firewall, one that
looks close enough to be the one the throttle cable goes through.
But......  the engine seal is covering the hole.

There is a tube with a flanged end that goes in from the carb side,
thrugh the shroud, throught the front tin, and which holds the seal away
from the throttle cable that is guided by the tube.  I like to put a small
hose clamp on the tube in front of the fan shroud to make sure the tube
stays put.  Make sure that this tube is present and completely in before
you start cutting on seals!
