Now that I've corrected my typo let me begin again: (thanks for your
patience list members) I have a 1974 transporter with an earlier 1.7 L
engine. I presently have a progressive Weber and I would like to get rid of
it (I think most of you know the reasoning) in favor of the L- jetronic fuel
injection system from a later model bus. Is there a method to adapt a 2.0 FI
system to my 1.7 engine? I have a set of 1.7 injectors from a 914 that could
be used, but my concern is with the Electronic Control Unit compatibility.
Have any of the list members had any success with this sort of conversion?
