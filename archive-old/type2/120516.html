Subject: Re: [T2] FOULED WIRE?

I downloaded a bunch of Weber related white paper a bit ago for my '72.
According to them (RedLine, I think), if it's carb related, your
condition should be traced to one of 2 things. (I admit I only skimmed
your earlier message, so if this was already suggested, I apologize for
repeating).
from the white paper:
1 - test choke and throttle linkage: check for full free movement at
carb while someone operates the controls. Experience has shown that
many carb problems result from over-tightened throttle levers.

2 - Test fast idle adjustment: with engine cold, press acclerator to
the floor once and release completely. Start engine, engine speed
should be 1000 to 2500 rpm after 10 seconds. Switch off engine. To
adjust - turn fast idle adjustment screw (edit:#36 on exploded view)
one half turn without disturbing carb linkage. turn in (clockwise) to
increase rpm, turn out (counter-clockwise) to decrease rpm; do not
touch accelerator pedal and restart engine.

I hope this helps. I remember having to cycle the different levers when
I disengaged my choke. Somehow it got hung up on something when I first
did it. I figured it was a rook error, but it could be a typical
problem with Webers after any fiddling.

Good luck,

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently posted a message about revving high.
&gt; Could a fouled spark plug increase the revs on the engine.
&gt; or the point gap or a worn distrubutor shaft.
&gt; grasping for reason!!!
