Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Refer Compressor unit for a T2 westy

Karl,

&gt; b) Or do you have a 2 burner stove to the right of the sink, under a wood cover? [P-27 model]

It is answer B. The wiring and &quot;control panel&quot; for the absorption unit is
still there. But, the unit is not.

Thanks for the link to the manual!

J

&gt;
&gt; If you have a, then you have a cooler.
&gt;
&gt; If you have b, then you will never find a compressor. The fridge is a
ammonia absorption unit. It has no
&gt; moving parts.
&gt; Simple explanation:
&gt; Under the left lid is the heating element.  With an ammonia system, you
heat up one end and the other end gets
&gt; ice cold.
&gt; And yes, the Westy fridge WILL make ice cubes in the 2 small ice cube
trays.
&gt; The aux battery is ONLY there to maintain the temp when you are
driving. When parked, you plug into 110V.
&gt; Here is the owners manual: http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/csmanual.htm
