Subject: 1969 Westy Turn Indicator Problem

Hi all,

I have an electrical problem with my &quot;new&quot; '69 Westy. 

Any time I use the turn signals, all of the following happens:

1. They audibly click merrily away.  

2. The turn signals blink outside the vehicle.

3. The turn signal indicator in the dash comes on and stays on without
blinking.

4. After I go around the corner, the blinkers go off, the audible
clicking stops, but the indicator in the dash stays on. The only way I
can get the turn signal indicators to go off again is to turn on the
headlights (if they aren't already on) and flash the highbeams. This
resets the indicator.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
Bob
'69 Westy (at least you can SEE the blinkers)
'59 Single Cab (you can't on this one.)
