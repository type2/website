Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to 
  your bus

&gt; In a stock RPM , road driven engine under 100 hp an over balanced ( more
&gt; than the mfg. does at the time of building it ) pressure plate is not
&gt; necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if your running a 502 Chevy mid engine powerplant in your type
&gt; 2 then I would advise to have the pressure plate checked anyway--prior
&gt; to it blowing outa the scatter sheild.
&gt; 
&gt; My buddies ran blown , Mopar, top fuel rails, and after a run dropped
&gt; the clutch assemblies, and popped a pressure plate and a disc fresh outa
&gt; the box back in the car.
&gt; Balanced only from whoever they got them from.
&gt; Hayes, is one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Not too common of a thing to beyond what ever the mfg. has done.

hey terry  I inderstand how that is and normally the plate will be very 
close. I have never been much for drag racing but I do a lot with the Formual Vee 
guys and these guys take balancing very seriously and in the heat of fixing a 
car so that it can race the next race worring about the balance of the pressure 
plate isn't worth  thinking about. They will worry about something like that 
if and only if it gives them a problem in the race. The Vee guys use a 40hp 
motor that is mostly stock and that they will tweak them  to get 62hp from and 
run these little suckers up to 6800rpm.  later  mark dearing
