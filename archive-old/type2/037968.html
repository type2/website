I used a hole punch as you describe to cut holes in my dash.  It gives a
much better finish than a saw.  You will want to borrow one if possible,
they are expensive (about 20 pounds).  If you do decide to saw it, don't
bother getting one of those multi-size spring steel things, they are as
useful as a chocolate teapot.  Get a proper hole saw.
