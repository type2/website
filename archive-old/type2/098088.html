Subject: Re: '78 Westy FI

Yes I do have a vaccum tester but I was trying to test by covering the
hose while engine was cold to check for vaccum and no vaccum when engine
warmed up. I don't think this is the problem with the gas but I am
checking(or trying to) all components. The injectors and cold start valve
all check good. Also the thermo time switch and the double relay test
good. Purchased a fuel pressure tester today to help with other test.

Thanks
