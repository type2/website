Subject: &quot;Rescue&quot; Missions

Though Richard's purchase of Joel's Crew Cab my not be a rescue from the 
crusher, it could still be a &quot;rescue&quot; from restoration limbo.  I'm not 
sure how to define an official limbo state.  Maybe a project that's been 
neglected for over 5 years?  My '60 DD Panel was recently saved from an 
eternal storage fate when I passed it along to someone else.  Hopefully the 
new '64 Deluxe will come out of the garage soon (no, no ... I'm *not* 
selling it).

I will be checking out a '64 Bus in the morning that *is* parked next 
to a crusher.  I'll report on either its rescue or the next ACS&amp;R mission 
for y'all when I return from the Mo-Kan swap meet Sunday evening.

BTW, I've received several complements on the ACS&amp;R shirt that I'm 
wearing today.  Very nice ...  :-)
