Subject: RE: [T2] Tires

&gt;From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot;


&gt;For those who don't mind mail ordering, for the same price as these
&gt;off-brand tires, I have the Hankook RA08 tire, which is made by an OEM
&gt;supplier to Volkswagen. In a head-to-head comparison, the German magazine
&gt;ProMobil-Extra rated the RA08 above the Michelin Agilis in every 
&gt;performance
&gt;aspect - despite the fact that it's 40% cheaper than the Michelin.  I have
&gt;been using them personally for years and recommend them highly.

&gt;For more info on Bus tire selection, see:

Hey there Ron,

These tires look great. I don't see mention for offroad or mud use on these. 
I live in Texas and although it snowed here during Christmas near me, I 
don't need snow tires. I do however need something that is good in the mud 
and dirt. I do a lot of off road driving daily in my Vanagon going places 
that amaze the 4wheel driving construction workers I am going to see. Civil 
concstruction, lots of dirt sometimes lots of mud. I don't have a Syncro, 
just a GL. Got anything to fit my ride?
