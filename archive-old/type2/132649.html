I have the solution, although I haven't sized it up to see if it would 
work.

As I mentioned earlier, it seems the heater is designed to be installed 
ABOVE the fuel tank.  Installing it in the cabin is probably not best, 
and I'm not sure how loud the thing is, but this is the plan:

Install the heater in the closet and put a false bottom in above it.  
Run the exhaust into the rear wheel well (as in the beetle front wheel 
well).  Combustion air would be drawn from the engine compartment,  
fresh air from the rear of the cabin.  Heated air would be ducted down 
the front of the wheel well (through the closet) and out underneath the 
closet door.  Fuel return line would be routed into the gas filler 
neck.  I don't know yet where I would put the switch - perhaps by the 
warm air outlet.

My stock heater works fine, but is good only for the cockpit, really.
