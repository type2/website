Subject: head 73 bus: trade I have 2.0, want 1.7

Here is a reference on cylinder heads.
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/cylhead.htm
It's best to match the part numbers.
There are several types of 2.0 Heads.
Vanagon has 2.0 Heads, they won't fit, they have square flat exhaust ports.
I have one good head that will fit your engine.
