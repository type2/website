[...]

Well I agree with all these comments.  However, in my reality we never
stay in one place more than two nights and even when we do stay for two
nights we usually arrive well after dark, are away surfing the entire
next day, and pack up early the next morning to head for the beach again
to surf some more before leaving for home.  The rest of our vacations we
usually only stay one night in any given place.

So in the 2 years that we've owned our Westy drive-away tent we've only
used it once.  When we did use it we loved it because we went camping
with my wife's sister and we stayed at the same campsite for about 6 or
7 days.  Especially with 3 people, we found that having an extra room to
store gunk in was excellent.

The tent I have is the drive-away model that attaches to the drip rail
of loafs (and probably splits and vanagons too)..  You can see a picture
of it at Joe Clark's Tent Page (the first one on the page titled &quot;The
Drive Away&quot;):

I purchased it 2 years ago from Rusty VanBondo.  It had a couple
pin-holes in the ceiling and a small tear in the side where the sliding
door opens.  I have fixed both of these.  The screens are intact.  All
poles are present and accounted for.  The downside is that the zippers
need to be either repaired or replaced.  Both the zipper around the
large &quot;hatch&quot; that opens up to give you access to the sliding door of
your bus and the main entrance zipper aren't working.  I guess Rusty
hadn't used it for a couple years and the plastic zippers failed shortly
after setting it up the first time.  Other than the zippers, the tent is
in excellent condition.

I'm asking US$300 plus shipping although if you live in the Bay Area
you're welcome to drop by and check it out.  I live in Cupertino.  I've
already paid once to have this tent moved from Vancouver to Silicon
Valley.  I don't want to pay to move it back to Vancouver at the end of
the summer just to put it back into storage again.

I f you're interested, let me know.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My experience has been quite the opposite.  The main advantages are
&gt; that it gives us a &quot;place to put our
&gt; stuff&quot; while clearing out the Westy to make it a living space, and a
&gt; larger
&gt; area to hang out if it's raining and we're staying under cover.
&gt; Considering
&gt; that the Westy interior is already a high-traffic area serving as our
&gt; &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bedroom,&quot; it helps to also have a semi-detached &quot;living
&gt; room&quot; if there are a few visitors around, or if we have inclement
&gt; weather. 
&gt; Plus if we leave our site we can leave the tent behind to save our
&gt; spot. 
&gt; On the other hand, for overnight stays in one place (where we wouldn't
&gt; be
&gt; spending time at the campsite) it's not worth the hassle.  Now that
&gt; our
&gt; first child is on the way (in 2-3 weeks!!), we expect to use the tent
&gt; as an
&gt; area to put the collapsable crib/playpen, etc. so that the baby will
&gt; be
&gt; nearby but protected from the elements when we are at the campsite.
