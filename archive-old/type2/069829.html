&gt; the major impracticality is that I only ever seem to get a few weeks driving

&gt; for longer). I'm hoping this will get less as I do each job well (it'll be
&gt; easier
&gt; next time if there is a next time), and as my skill improves (I'll get it done
&gt; faster).

I'm not a splitty owner, but I second that emotion! What would anyone
expect from 25-30+ year old vehicles? Each new job brings me closer to a
VERY practical vehicle. One which can haul people, pets, produce, and
provide shelter at a moment's notice. Heck, I lived out of a '70 westy for
three months between contracts one time. Pretty cool...sleeping out where
I could actually hear what was going on around me instead of being
isolated by four thin walls. Late Fall, no heat, just two thick sleeping
bags. I loved it! 8) Joe
