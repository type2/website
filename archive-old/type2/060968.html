&gt; On a side note... Harmon, how did you mount the decel valve?  I had a late

&gt;

        Well, mine's a little different, since I ripped all my FI parts out
of a '81 vanagon -- anyway, I had the decel valve mount, and just screwed it
onto the firewall like the relays and that other electrical thingy whose name
escapes me at the moment.
      Lucky you to have the '79 mounts -- I took the mounts for the airfilter
and CU out of my '81 too, but they weren't of much use, too different a body.
Oh well, my '73 is pretty rusty anyway, I'm going to find a better westy body
one of these days.
