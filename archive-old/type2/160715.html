&gt;I just installed new tie rods and I went to have it aligned.  I come

&gt;different side to side and I know this is now centered at the wrong spot 
&gt;inside the steering box.

After the tie-rods are adjusted to set the proper toe at the wheels, jack up the front wheels and turn the steering wheel all the way left, then counting rotations, all the way right. Then go back half of what you counted and this should center the road wheels.

Disconnect the drag link from the steering box pitman arm and recenter the steering wheel (all the way left, then halfway right just as before).

Now that the steering box is centered you can adjust the drag link at the pitman arm to fit. All done.

If the steering wheel isn't perfectly straight you can now (and only now) pull it off the column and adjust it. You will see two lines marked on the wheel and the column to show where the factory thought the parts should have been aligned.
