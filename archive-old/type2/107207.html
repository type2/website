&gt; The first is the LR taillight assembly. All the lights on it are dimmer

&gt; connections at the lights and at the brake booster (cleaning as I went). No
&gt; luck. My next thought is to check the LR ground wire, thinking that the
&gt; ground wire is some thing that the LR turn signal, brake light and,
&gt; taillight all have in common. Beyond that I have no idea where to look.

Just a shot in the dark, but the bulb housing corrode also and I've found
that situations like brake lights or backup lights but no both can be cured
by a new bulb or cleaning the contacts on the bulb.
