Subject: Re:[T2] alternate fuels

i have heard of peroxide powered cars, i know a guy who has a patent for a
peroxide engine, but mostly when someone says peroxide powered car they are
talking ROCKET powered, not what you typically see in a bus :-)  the peroxide
engine the guy i know designed is essentially a type of jet engine .  Ii think
this guy is either misleading you and he has a water alcohol injection on the
intake, which does nothing they are claimed to increase gas mileage etc. etc.
but i have researched this and the consensus is it doesn't really work,  or
just maybe he pulled something off but i'm a skeptic.
