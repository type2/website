Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Fuel injection question about 76 two liter

Hello Andy  :~).....Good question. Silicone might have been a better 
choice, but not for engines with Lambda sensors.. I'll never know  unless 
someone else tests it. You certainly deserve a complete justification for 
my obviously unusual selection of emergency repair materials. Here we go......

Silicone rubber might have worked for a little while, but it sets up pretty 
firm, and might not have been very adhered to what I think is a slick 
molded plastic surface.  And I calculated that the patch needed to have 
some degree of flow capability to cope with constant flexing at the point 
of duct failure. Wide open, the crack was about an eighth of an inch wide 
and over an inch long. Closed, the width was zero. This crack developed 
because the engine throttle body connects to the lower end of the duct, and 
it bounces around a matter of inches, about a million times a day, and the 
air meter box at the top of the duct is firmly tied to a fixed chassis 
member by way of the air filter assembly. I tested this design for about 26 
years.

26 years of flexing a million times a day (but not every day) has revealed 
the failure mode of the material, and the resulting failure degraded its 
function as a closed duct for induction air. So, using materials at hand, I 
invented a highly flexible and reliable patch, (they make footballs out of 
pigskin) and I expect the crack to open and close about a million times a 
day for the next few weeks, until I get a replacement duct....which I hope 
lasts another 26 years. At which time, incidentally, I will be 97.

The body filler and rope just stabilized the area above the crack, and were 
probably not necessary. In doing it again, I'd probably leave them out. 
They were part of the first attempt at this repair. They didn't flex with 
the duct. Rather than risk cutting them out, I just worked around 
them.  So, I looked for something that WOULD flex....something that would 
flow just a bit while sticking to the slick plastic moving surfaces. That 
was the Mortite*. Then I came up with the pigskin to hold it in place and 
serve as a secondary seal and provide a non-flowing outer skin. The cable 
ties held it in place above and below the crack.....creating a deflated 
balloon around the duct. Even if the Mortite failed at the crack, it helped 
seal the balloon, and the balloon would prevent much extra air from getting 
into the measured induction stream. And since the Mortite never set up, it 
would deal with backfires and be around to get pulled back into the crack 
by vacuum. It flowed a little bit. Silicon would set up and become a 
lump....which might also work just fine.

Possibly someone will design and package a small emergency  repair kit 
containing such materials, and it could be marketed through VW dealerships, 
The Bus Depot, and a dozen chains of auto parts stores. It would save 
people running around to hardware stores and Goodwill outlets.  Good luck. 
I have other things that interest me.

*Correction...In my post, I called the patch stuff Cordite and when I 
looked at the box later, it said Mortite. (I'm happy with whatever memory I 
have left.) Not that it matters, except cordite is an explosive, and I 
wouldn't want anyone to think I was fixing my engine with an explosive. 
Please register that correction, all those who wish to follow in my 
footsteps as they cope with similar emergency repairs. There will be some 
that need it.

I don't know how many 1976 Westies are out there yet, but I'll bet a LOT of 
them are developing similar part failures, as well as Vanagons through 1983 
and other loafs that used FI. Get some Mortite and some pigskin and some 
cable ties, and you are ready for that contingency. It works. Don't know 
how long.......but you only need about a week, to get the replacement part.

And I'll leave it to Andy to test the adequacy of Silicone Rubber under 
similar circumstances. Might be just the thing. I wouldn't want it if I had 
a Lambda sensor....but I don't. I only have one test mule to work with, and 
it is committed already.

Regards and good luck,   Doyt Echelberger    Surviving in Ohio, where it 
has been raining every day. And I am enjoying every minute of it.

Lets see you have body filler wrapped with rope jammed around with cordite
wrapped with pigskin held on with cable ties....
Silicone might have been a tad easier.
