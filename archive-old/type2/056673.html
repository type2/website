Subject: Re:removing the closet

hi volks, how hard is it to remove the closet from a 72 westy? the wife wants
to put in new curtains.

Marty,
  Sorry to tell you this but you have to first remove the icebox/sink, the
jumpseat behind the drivers seat, the folding rear seat, the overhead
storage compartment, then you can finally remove the closet.  None of this
is very difficult, just time consuming (which is probably why you see so
many faded curtains in the window that the closet blocks).
