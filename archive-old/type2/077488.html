Subject: Re: [T2] cloth seat covers?

Standard 78 buses came in vinyl.
Westfalia's came with plaid cloth inserts.
Champagne Edition buses came with brown cloth inserts.
Or do you have later Vanagon seats in yours?

 
&gt; On my 78 bus, I have seat covers that are partially cloth....any leads on
&gt; where to get replacements that are not all vinyl?
&gt; 
&gt; The only replacements I have found so far are all vinyl.
