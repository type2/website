Subject: Re: power loss, idle trouble [1600DP, Solex 30] [a little long]

[...]

I have this same exact problem.  New battery and all.  I put in new plug
wires today and a new dizzy cap as my old ones were bad... actually I got new
plug wires because the connectors kept breaking on my old ones....  Lifetime
warranty is nice ;)
I spent an hour today in the Autozone parking lot getting my bus started.  I
even tried the old screwdriver on the solenoid trick.... only got it to spark
once in a while...I guess I'm not talented enough.  So I push started my
bus...by myself!!  It took me about 5 tries...back and forth..back and
forth.  I got my workout! my knees feel like rubber bands.  anyways... the
very low idle thing is still persistent.  It doesn't do it when its
warm...but anything under thirty degrees...and I'm screwed.  its not carb
icing either.

please help....this really sucks

&gt; Hi folks.
&gt;
&gt; This problem started recently.  I've been out of town
&gt; and driven the bus little since mid-December, so I'm
&gt; not sure exactly when it came on, though it seemed to
&gt; be fairly sudden [say, within about one week/one tank of
&gt; gas].  I had trouble accessing this list for several
&gt; days, so this report has grown with my trials and
&gt; errors.
&gt;
&gt; Original symptoms: Low power.  Low top end speed.  Warm
&gt; idle speed abruptly switches between 900-600 or lower,
&gt; despite repeated readjustments to 850-900.  Nasty
&gt; backfiring. Suddenly deciding to die at stop lights--
&gt; sometimes. When it did die it was very hard to start,
&gt; and would only catch when I cranked and cranked with
&gt; the accelerator to the floor. [3-year-old battery is
&gt; sending me hate mail over this, as were the cars in
&gt; traffic behind me.]
&gt;
&gt; What I've done so far: I checked and rechecked valves,
&gt; dwell, and timing, and checked carb settings. Valves
&gt; and timing were due this week anyway--this is the new
&gt; Mexican engine I got last summer.
&gt;
&gt; When I went over the carb, I found that the idle
&gt; mixture adjustment screw was WAY off--don't know why,
&gt; since a friend and I checked it out in October. [The
&gt; carb is a Solex 30, with an adapter for the 34mm DP
&gt; intake.] I also found and tightened a couple of loose
&gt; exhaust clamps. After all this, I took it for a 4-5
&gt; mile test drive, featuring up- and down-shifting and
&gt; hills, and it seemed to be running fine.  Sounded and
&gt; felt great--I figured the carb settings were the
&gt; culprit.  Power okay [well, within reason, folks],
&gt; acceleration okay, idle good, no backfiring.
&gt;
&gt; About 3 hours later I took it on a run to someplace
&gt; about 10 miles away, and after about 2-3 miles it had
&gt; all the old bad symptoms again, except for backfiring:
&gt; low power, low top-end, low idle, death wish at stop
&gt; lights.
&gt;
&gt; Pause two days here, while I wait for a break in the
&gt; Oregon rain.  Today I replaced the points, plugs, and
&gt; coil and checked all the ignition connections [working
&gt; by myself, I couldn't test for a good spark from the
&gt; coil so I swapped it out].  I went over the thing
&gt; looking for vacuum leaks, found nothing that struck me
&gt; as a problem.
&gt;
&gt; At the end of work today, it starts easily enough and
&gt; will idle tolerably well but now it refuses to rev.  If
&gt; I open the throttle fairly quickly, it coughs and will
&gt; die if I don't let off the throttle again.  If I inch
&gt; the RPMs up very slowly, I can get to about 1800 before
&gt; it coughs and gives out.  Occasionally it takes a
&gt; rhythm, cutting out, picking up, cutting out, picking
&gt; up.  At 1800 RPMs that happens about one beat per
&gt; second.
&gt;
&gt; I'm stumped. Other than fixing the backfiring, I've
&gt; made no progress and even lost some ground. What am I
&gt; missing here?  Any suggestions would be very welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah--happy new year everyone!
