Subject: Re: [T2] 71 engine into a 65 Not!!!

&gt; Well ran into a job ending snag and really don't know what to do to solve
it.
&gt;
&gt; I have the doghouse cooler setup on the 71 engine. So I had to use the
71's
&gt; fan housing.  When I went to bolt it on, the pulley for the generator
doesn't
&gt; line up.  I found out a while back that I have a bug generator with a bug
&gt; backing plate.

The bug generator and the bug backing plate were from the 71 fan housing.
