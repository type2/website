Hi,
 
I've got a problem with my 1975 T2b bus. It doesn't accelerate anymore. When i push the accelerator pedal it stops accelerating at a certain speed (in 3th gear at +/-50 km/hour and in 4th gear at +/-70 km/hour) when i try to accelerate some more, the engine makes a lot of noise (number of revolutions is increasing, while the speed remains the same). Also, when I slow down on the engine, the exhaust pipe makes some noise, which wasn't there before.
 
What could this be?
 
Greetz,
 
Wietse
