David

this is a hard topic to discuss,, Your right, the stock method may not be
the best.
I tend to suggest first,,, then listen to the alternatives,, most of the
alternative idea's I've heard are not what *I* would use,   each to their
own.

&gt; Not entirely correct either.  It takes resistance AND current to generate

You got me here,, and I was going to say it does not really matter,,, but,
your still right.
We are talking simple here,, but this circuit has a percentage impedance
with the resistance.
It is impedance that holds back the current. Impedance doesn't effect the
heat.
All things in the world have many factors that effect them.

&gt; Flawed logic.  A tungsten wire in a vacuum will not burn!  A thin,

I wasn't talking about the tungsten,, I was trying to demonstrate
-thinking that you can push current is flawed-
In this case, the voltage is relatively constant,, so the LOAD determines
the current... in this example, the starter normally draws a large amount
of current,, but the thin test light wire won't allow it to pass ,, and
the lamp is part of that circuit.

your right,, not a perfect example,,



&gt; &gt;If you connect a dead battery to a fully charged one using #12 wire,
the wire
&gt; &gt;will *not* burn up.
&gt;
&gt; Under the right circumstances, I think it would be possible.  A dead
&gt; battery has very low internal resistance.  If it's dead enough it will be
&gt; like a short to the charged battery.  Lots of current will flow.  No light
&gt; bulbs in the circuit to protect you.


Nope.... unless the battery is shorted,, it won't draw enough current.
But ,, your correct again,, the circumstance that can cause grief could
exist..
btw,, the copper does not burn,, the insulation does, so that is why a
loom surrounding the #12 is important.
insulation is part of the factors determining the current capacity of wire.


&gt; In one of my previous messages, I said something like &quot;in real life&quot; the
&gt; smaller wire probably wouldn't be that dangerous.  That's because in real
&gt; life the high current draw only lasts a few seconds.  With a very dead
&gt; battery, the #12 wire would probably heat up, but the current would
&gt; probably drop to a safe level before it melted and caught
&gt; fire.  Probably.  But why risk it?

Well,, There is no real risk,, using the  #12 wire with a loom, a relay
that closes, to join the aux and the starter battery, after the starter
current is disconnected, and the alternator is making voltage.
The impedance will choke any high current effectively


&gt;And the main reason not to use the
&gt; smaller wire is because the battery won't charge as well (more on this
below).

Hmm,,, reply to this below

&gt; Utilities understand that short circuits happen from time to time in your

David wrote:
&gt; Nope.  They use circuit breakers to protect you.  Those small wires could
&gt; and would burn if not for that.  By your logic, they shouldn't need circuit
&gt; breakers if the wire limits the current!  So tell me, why do they have
&gt; circuit breakers?

Actually,, most utilities DO not use breakers,,, or fuses... none!
Well,, that isn't exactly true,, there is a primary fuse,, protecting the
100kva trans.
A 20 apt complex might require 100kw for all 20 units, this at 27,000volts
would need a fuse 4amps
that fuse does NOT provide any protection to the secondary single apt
breaker panel.
It sort of protects the transformer, but not the feeder conductors going
to the 60 or 100 amp house panels
even then, the #6 or #3 wires don't burn up with 400 amps fault current,
it is the breaker or fuse that fails in a destructive way.
The secondary power in = power out says there is well over 400 amps
available normally, and under short circuit conditions,, it is feasible to
see 10,000 at any installation,, in a downtown radial loop, our
calculations turn up 500,000 amps available ,,
If a fault happened between the breaker inside the house, and the
transformer,,  and the backhoe happens to dig into that cable, .. I'll see
if I can find the photos of the vapourized bucket.

If a really good fault happened inside the house ,, the breaker is slow to
react, this can explode a breaker, or a fuse. Most breakers fail at about
25,000 amps,, and fuses will handle 200,000 amps.

My point is ,, it is normal practice to ensure the wires are long enough
to provide enough impedance to effectively choke and reduce the available
inrush current to a level that the protection can operate at.
If an apt is tooo close &lt;along the conductor path&gt; ,then more conductor is
added.  As simple as winding up 25' of conductor and laying it in the
bottom of the electrical enclosure.



&gt; Another thing - undersize wire will cause voltage drops.  If you were
&gt; really limiting the current with wire size, you would have zero voltage at
&gt; the limit and nothing would operate!  The wire would be absorbing all the
&gt; power in that case.

That is taking it to extremes,, but that principle does have applications.

getting back to batteries,, current thru undersize wire_will_cause a
voltage drop along the resistance.. thus limiting the current, any rapid
change is opposed by the magnetic effect it created also limiting the
current.
This is the impedance part,, the alternator, and the fully charged starter
battery are still at 12v
as the voltage rises at the aux battery, the current will taper off, the
voltage drop will diminish, and more voltage will appear at the aux
battery terminals.


&gt; &gt;Older cars used to be wired with huge welding cable wires off the positive
&gt; &gt;terminals
&gt;
&gt; They also used to be 6V.  Lower voltages needed thicker cables.

Well,, I wasn't trying to compare 6v vs 12v systems,, I wasn't clear about
that tho,
When safety started to become a factor,, they tried fused links,, but they
were a maintenance problem, so cable size was reduced to limit the
available current,, as well as higher internal resistance batteries.



&gt; &gt;Back to volkswagen,, for all you who fear undersized wire, Do not, Do not,
&gt; &gt;Do not, look at the wire from your alternator to the starter, I suspect
&gt; &gt;you will think IT is undersized.  As it is ONLY a ~ #9 size wire! [6.0]
&gt; &gt;The main charge conductor! Just slightly larger than a #10 awg!
&gt;
&gt; That is because it will never, ever have to carry more than 55 amps!!!  And
&gt; I guaran-friggin-tee you VW made sure it would carry 55 amps without
&gt; burning up.

See,, your stating a number that is from a rating,,55amp alternator,, but
if that alternator gets full field, because the regulator failed,,  you
can hear the HP drain on the engine,, more than 55amps
If you use a wire 3 sizes larger,, instead of a #8, try a #2 or a parallel
two #8's, and then full field the alternator.  you will see that same
source put out much more current.
My point is that small wire size does limit the current.



&gt;
&gt; &gt;when you use #12 wire to the aux system,, it limits the current to less
&gt; &gt;than ~20 amps,, a very good value for battery charging,, IF the load you
&gt; &gt;have connected draws 12 amps,, then only 8 amps will be left to charge the
&gt; &gt;dead battery. ,, well not really as the voltage will drop off, and
&gt; &gt;therefore the current will drop off,, but the battery doesn't care, it
&gt; &gt;loves current to get it back to charged level,
&gt;
&gt; What?  Jamie, I'm beginning to think you have some misconceptions about the
&gt; fundamentals of electricity.  If your battery is dead (say, 11.5V) and you
&gt; are trying to charge it with a small wire but there is still a 12 amp load
&gt; on the battery (using your example above) the voltage at the battery is
&gt; likely to be at or below 11.5V and the battery will not charge.  This is
&gt; because there is likely to be a 1.5V drop across your #12 wire with a 12
&gt; amp load on it (I haven't done the math but I bet I'm close).  The battery
&gt; will only charge if the voltage supplied to it is higher than it's own
&gt; voltage - it doesn't matter if you have a million amps available, it will
&gt; not charge unless this is true.  You said the battery doesn't care, but it
&gt; most certainly does!

If there is any current flowing into the battery that means the voltage is
higher, current will only flow from the highest potential to the lowest.
There must be a potential difference for current to flow.  What I was
saying was just for example,, but the point I was making was the small
wire limits the current to some value, say 20 amps, the battery will draw
about 5 - 20 amps to charge it.  If your load is about 12 amps, then only
8 amps would be available to charge the battery,, lengthening the time to
charge the battery.

The comment I was trying to address was from Jason wrote:
BUT! consider this situation. typical hella relay setup w/ 12ga wire
between batteries and relay. Camper kills battery listening to tunes
while camping w/ friends at BBB and burning the cabin lights. The
camper still has on all the accessories when he starts the bus. What
will happen? I dunno. I suspect that everything will try to pull as
much power as is needed through the little relay and wire, but I am
not sure. anyone have any real input on this? i.e. actually have some
books to back up everyone's claims?


This is true,, the load will still try to draw the same power,, if the
load is less than the alt output, then the battery will get some charge,,
if not,, the aux battery and the starter battery and the alternator will
all attempt to supply the load, and you will soon be in trouble again.
You will have to turn off some of the load,,

Ron Soloman pointed this out while trying to explain the connections of
the Hella relay kit
Ron wrote:
It's a matter of simple math.  The alternator (via the relay) is delivering
a fixed amount of current to the aux. battery when you drive.  As long as the
amount of charge going into the battery (from your alternator while driving)
is higher than the amount going out (being consumed by your accessories
while driving), the battery will charge.  The higher the ratio of current
going in to current going out, the faster it charges.  If you are not
running anything off of the aux. battery while driving, the battery will
charge at the maximum rate that the setup allows (which is what the
instruction sheet is trying to say).  The more stuff you are running, the
slower it will charge.  If you are running so much stuff while driving that
they are drawing as much as the current going in, the battery will not
charge at all.  If you are trying to run stuff that draws _more_ current
than the battery is taking in (such as a huge sound system), the battery
will actually discharge even if you are driving (but at a reduced rate), and
if you are doing this often, you need to consider a different alternative.




&gt;
&gt; &gt;The relay is the best way to go,, an electronic isolator &lt;diodes&gt; creates
&gt; &gt;it's own problems with charge levels.
&gt;
&gt; Here we agree.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; I've been in this game a long time, and I've tried lots and lots of
&gt; different things.  Once upon a time I used thinner wire to connect the aux
&gt; battery and found that it did not charge well.  Part of that was probably
&gt; due to the stock mechanical regulator limiting the voltage to less than it
&gt; should have been, but part of it was also due to the voltage drop across
&gt; the small wire.  If you have #4 cable from the alternator to your starting
&gt; battery, and #12 from your alternator to your aux battery, your aux battery
&gt; will NEVER charge as well as your starting battery.  If you run the #12
&gt; wire from the + terminal of your starting battery, it makes it even
&gt; worse.  I decided to eliminate that bottleneck.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line for me is that I know for a fact that what I have works
&gt; well.  I use #4 (4 gauge) cable and a high-power relay to isolate my
&gt; auxiliary battery and anyone who knows me well knows that my lights always
&gt; work, my fridge is always cold and my bus always starts.  To those who want
&gt; to duplicate the stock Westfalia system, more power to you, but be sure to
&gt; include a circuit breaker or fuse to protect yourself, and carry a spare
&gt; relay.  Remember that just because it was stock, doesn't mean it was
&gt; optimal.  VW and Westfalia made lots of decisions based on cost, packaging
&gt; constraints, what was available to them at the time and other variables
&gt; that may not be relevent now.  My motto is to use materials that are
&gt; appropriate for the job.  In my bus, that meant large cables capable of
&gt; handling &gt;100 amps with very low resistance.
&gt;
&gt; -David



Well,, I hope it doesn't seem like I am arguing with you, I do disagree
with a few points,, but in effect what your doing isn't toooo far off what
I call correct,,

I wouldn't use #4 cable....
Until this discussion,, I wouldn't have recommended a fuse or breaker
either,, I don't see any use for it.
But there is a bimetal breaker available for large battery chargers,, that
might be an asset.
If you get a self resetting breaker,, or a short circuit operating fuse it
will give you piece of mind , and not nuisance tripping
