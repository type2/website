&lt;&lt; ought two today for $79 each from Auto 
 Zone locally. They have a lifetime warranty and the manager assures me that

 warranty. I told him about the last set of boots I put on my old axles self 
 destructed in a year. &gt;&gt;
Has anyone seen one of the auto zone stores in the nw? or maybe a nw counter
