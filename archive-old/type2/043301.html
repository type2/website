Subject: External Oil Cooler

I was driving yesterday in So Cal up a steep grade on I-15 and when I
reached the top I had to stop for a border check point.  Anyway, when I
stopped and the motor went to idle, the oil light flickered on and it wanted
to stall.  I blipped the throttle and eventually it died.  Did it get too
hot?  Do I need an external oil cooler?  Does anybody use external oil
coolers?  I am heading out on a trip to Yellowstone and DO NOT want to fry
the motor on the way up.  It was 80-90F yesterday and would not have
expected the bus to heat up.  I will be driving through the desert where it
might be hotter that 115F.  Is this suicide for the bus?  Can you tell that
I have no confidence in my bus?  Anyway, I want to have a fun trip and spend
it camping and not wrenching.  Any tips appreciated.


BTW, I have an Empi header.  Could I be running lean?  Do I need to re-jet?
