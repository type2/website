Y'know, I was just thinking about that last nite...  I'm pretty sure
that the ONLY vehicles I've named have been Volkswagons.  Zelda was my
very first car, an early beetle, light blue, with the rectangular canvas
sliding sunroof.  Her career with me was rather shortlived, due to an
unfortunate altercation with a black angus steer.  The steer walked
away.  Zelda was towed and sold.  Now I have Sally, the '72 camper.

Then there was a '65 6 cylinder mustang, a '56 Dodge panel with a slant
6 (boy, was this ez to work on!  Here's where I started cutting my
automotive incisors), a plymouth belvedere with pushbutton transmission
(in a few years they'll be putting those into spaceships), a '78 or '79
toyota pickup that had been chopped into a convertible with a soft top
and roll bar, then a '56 Ford Country Sedan 6v, red and white (oh, wait,
the exception, not vw and not female, Tommy), a nondescript toyota, an
'84 subar gl...

I think I named Tommy because he was such a poor ol' thing when I got
him.  The PO hadn't understood that the system was a positive ground -
so figgered the charging system was posessed.  I picked him up for $100
or so...  He was practically falling apart, but I finally sold him to
someone who promised to do a nice resto on him.  Sure wish I knew what
finally happened.

Thanks for the trip down memory lane!  

Teri
