Subject: left over parts from '71 offered for sale

I have the following parts left over from a recent restoration of a '71
Westfalia:
v
seal, rear cargo door 68-71  WCM#211-193C  - (good used, never glued in)-$25 
original VW front bumper step pads  VW#211707-291 and -292    -------$25  
     (not as good as new, but cleaned up much nicer than expected
      after buying WCM replacements --68-72)
original sliding door curtain, yellow,brown and white, a little faded
--free if yours is missing.
new WCM louvered window seal -black #241-522-L/R ----------------------$10
new left and Right door seals (but JCwhitney aftermarket Brazilian)
------$10ea.
     (I liked the rubber that came in the WCM door kit better--even though
      one was bad and they replaced it)
new WCM rear window seal 68-79   261-521C--------------------------------$10
     (The window installer liked the side window seal better for 
       some reason, and I forgot to get this back into the return shipment)
  v
can trade for parts needed: sliding door inside handle, left front turn
signal lens 
(hella), air conditioning compressor and mounting bracket for an upright
engine.  
I would prefer to stay away from york compressors in favor of the more
efficient 
units often sold in aftermarket bug air conditioning kits. I have all the
like new air 
conditioning parts out of a 78 brown and tan 7 seater.  gear shift
extension lever 
that used to be available from Gene Burg and CB performance.  transporter
cover 
that won't hold moisture or cost a fortune.  an old ratty drive-away tent
that I could 
use as a pattern for building a tent boot to a more modern lightweight (and
cheaper) 
standard camping tent.  a Westfalia cabinet handle. a spare head-light
relay.  The 
little clip the horn wire attaches to at the bottom of the steering tube ,
so that I can 
get my horn to work.  Soldering the horn ground wire to the base of the
steering 
column didn't help much. hints on a comfortable highback seat that is
easily adapted 
to '71 tracks and won't put my eye level any higher.  seeds to Tabernanthe
iboga.
