OK, I finally got my brake parts in from Bus Depot
and found that I have one defective rear cylinder -
it's missing the hole for the bleeder valve. No problem
I'll just take it to work and have the tool room
put one in for me. No offense to Ron, I know they can't
inspect every part that comes through the door.

The question that I do have is about the master
cylinder. The one I received has two ports on the top
for the resevoir. My current MC (which is shot) has
only one connection from the resevoir to the MC. Can I
use this MC? I could tap the front hole and block it
off, or should I check my donor bus and see if it has
a resevoir that will work? Any suggestions are
appreciated. I would rather not have to send it back,
as Everybus is coming up shortly and it would never
make it in time.

TIA
