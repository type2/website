Those in the North still have plenty of time,
but those of us in the South...........
Remember to buy your big box of artificial fire logs before the grocery
stores run out for the season.
Always nice to have a 3 hour fire log readily at hand on those late Spring
, Summer, and Fall campout nights.

I generally go through 2-3 boxes over the season before they start to show
up again in the grocery stores around November.

Better to have a nice fire 'a-going and a cold brewsky in the fist while 
you sit beside the old type 2, than to have to go around grubbing up scrap
bits of broken twigs and limbs than you can manage to find near the camp
site.

Just a reminder.
