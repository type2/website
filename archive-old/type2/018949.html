Subject: Isaiah needs calipers
Message-ID: &lt;3804E84B.5A0D649C_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

hey all...upon removal of my calipers today I found that the pistons
were stuck (not all of them) and I really would like new or rebuilt ones
as I don't have the time to monkey around with rebuilding them.  Does
anyone have any calipers that would fit a 71 just lying around?  I don't
have $200 to drop on new ones...
please help me out with this asap as I need to drive my bus to the
campout next weekend...
thank you!

Isaiah
ps I will trade you my old calipers and some cash if you can get them to
me...my calipers are very rebuildable...as I said before...I just don't
have the time
