Subject: Nathaniel's 78

&gt;and your problem is likely to be carb icing. Subject: [T2] '78 bus

&gt; HelloSorry about the first mail. That was an accident

Five bucks says that this was the standard VW shop late bus treatment:
Remove the allegedly 'seized' engine, replace it with a type4 of question=
able
lineage, pop a weber progressive (or a motocraft clone) and 009 on it and=
 send
it on its way.

Nathaniel, its a long shot that your problem is icing - although it is
possible. Have the bug shop put at least the right distributor on the eng=
ine.
Look up your bus here http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm and you wi=
ll be
able to hand them a part number. They will give you a hassle about the ne=
w
part being extremely expensive.  Advise them that the original engine sho=
uld
still have this part on it.  If they do this conversion alot, they'll hav=
e a
few of the correct distributors laying around - thinking they are inferio=
r to
the 009. Make sure that when you suck on the vac port (yes, with your mou=
th)
that it moves the plate inside the distributor. This means that the vac
canister is still good. You will see an improvement in take off. If they =
can
replace the single carb with either the FI system from the original engin=
e (if
it still had FI) or run a set of dual carbs, you will see a serious
improvement.  If they can't swing the dual carbs, have them go rebuild th=
e
existing carb and make sure there are no vac leaks anywhere - including w=
here
the intakes meet the heads.
If they charged you a grand or better to do the job they owe you these th=
ings
i would think.
