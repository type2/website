Subject: Re: [T2] the mechanic's full notes on Alice

sounds funky there about alice T....

the mechanic sounds like they dont need to work on anything else really...
i know it is frustrating but it ought to be a challenge to the mechanic to help you out...

sounds to me like there is still a vaccum leak somewheres but i dont know ...
sounds like you might want to check the intake boots right up under the carb and also might want to check the brake booster hose...
there is a little plastic piece there in the brake booster hose more towards the engine compartment that is hooled into the hose did they replace that?
easy way but not the safest to check intake boots is to crank her up and let her idle and then take a can of carb spray very careful remember it is flamable....
and spray it towards the intake boots if the bus idles up then there is a leak in the intake boots...
just a thought .. one more thing to check on the list,...
if there is a vaccum leak you will have loss of power as you have talked about and also alice will run like crap...


are you sure these guys know what they are doing...?
patience is in working on the air cooled engine..
they couldnt get it right so they gave up..
so glad that i havent had that experience from mechanics,...
i know its frustrating but like going to the doctor you might want to get a second opinion from another local mechanic..
honestly i dont want anybody that is so easy to give up working on my Grace...
shes my baby bus and i tell you time and time again i have wanted to give up but couldnt...
from the help of the list here and some locals she got up and running..
she has a sucked valve now and possibly a burnt piston/s?
not sure but i will get it handled...
this was all from previous ownership.. the PO very much neglected Grace but that is another story...
i have replaced everything on the outside::;;; now for the inside to be redone..
sorry to hear that you are haveing so many problems,..
i hope the best for you and alice...
btw next time you get a chance 
take another one of the glossy 8x10 's LOL...
and then begin to tell the story again of alice LOL...
holler back T
i dont kow alot but have been through a good bit so far with Grace..
peace
