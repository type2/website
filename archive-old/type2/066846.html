Subject: Bug muffler on '71 bus? Need quick yes/no

Quick one - 

I'm ordering parts right now - need a muffler, have decided I don't need
some fancy extractor header dealy-bob. So - I can use a bug muffler,
right? I don't need to get the stock 1-tailpipe design, right? There's a
bug muffler on there now, it don't quite fit right, but the PO so
seriously mangled it before installing it (cut parts off, didn't use any
hardware) that I don't think its not fitting necessarily reflects
reality. I'm running a stock 1600DP.

Thanks,

Anton
