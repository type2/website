&gt; Thanks for your input Dave.  I'm wondering though - what about the
gross
&gt; discrepancy between the rod journal sizes listed in the Tom Wilson
&gt; book?  The 2.0 specs they show a 1.5xx&quot; rod journal for the Vanagon
and
&gt; the rod journal on an older T4 baywindow 2.0L is listed as a
&gt; 1.9xx&quot; something or nother.  Does this mean the journals on the AC
Vanagon
&gt; engines were smaller and thusly weaker than its baywindow
&gt; counterpart

VW used the same crank in the early Type4 engines (1700/1800) as was
used in the later (2000) engines.  The larger displacement was
achieved by using an &quot;offset grind&quot; on the crank.  The result was a
longer stroke, and a smaller journal.
