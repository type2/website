Subject: Re: SMoke and timing

&gt;Hello Hello,
&gt;Well I am continuing to have problems with my new bus.  Nothing big 
just a few
&gt;small things.  For one, I can't get that dang oil drip to stop.  It 
still
&gt;looks like it is coming from between the valve cover and the head.  I 
replaced
&gt;the valve cover gasket yesterday, but it continues to drip.   Could it 
be
&gt;something else?  I would like to get it fixed so I could stop having 
smoke
&gt;come out of the defrost vents.

It is possible that it is still coming from the valve cover gasket.  
When you replace the gasket, you must be sure to make the sealing 
surfaces very very clean and smooth.  Use some steel wool or perhaps 
some fine-grit sandpaper and go over the surface on the cylinder head, 
removing all the old gunked-up oil and bits of past gaskets.  Also get 
the surface in the valve cover as clean and smooth as possible.  Then 
when installing the gasket, coat both sides of the gasket with a light 
even coating of wheel bearing grease.  And finally, make sure you have 
the valve cover fully seated on the head when you are done.  


&gt;
&gt;Also,  I am trying to time the bus but I don't know what to time it to. 
It is
&gt;a 79 that  was converted to a weber carb.  By the way, on the timing
&gt;scale...what is BTCD and AFTDC .  Is BTCD to the left of the zero or 
the
&gt;right.  Just wondering.  Trying not to drive to much until I get the
&gt;overheating problem done.

The carb doesn't matter so much as the distributor does.  If you are 
still using the stock '79 distributor, and it's not a California model, 
then the timing should be set to 7.5 degrees BTDC.  You can work from 
there.

On the plastic timing scale, BTDC is to the left of the 0 (think about 
it, the engine turns clockwise, so before TDC would be before the 0 and 
ATDC is of course after or to the right of the 0)

Good luck
