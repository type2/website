&gt;Thanks for all the replies guy and gals, buskatiers alike. Another question I 
&gt;wanted to ask was about my ols plugs. When I took them out they were real sutty 
&gt;black and the #4 plug had a little oil on the threads. What kind of sign is 
&gt;this? 

FI plugs should look like this: greyish with only black on the edge. They run leaner than a normal carb setup so don't freak out if you are reading any &quot;standard&quot; plug reading guides with pictures.

Here's another picture of my plugs when the thermostat cable broke and the engine wasn't heating up properly. Even though  it ran really rough the plugs still didn't foul that badly:

When there is oil on the threads it means it was probably only loose in the head. 22 ft lbs. IIRC.

BTW y'all, I picked up the thermostat cable at the dealer. They actually had it in stock and I almost fainted.
