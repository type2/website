Subject: Exhaust leaks

Hello,
I am trying to close up some exhaust leaks on my 78 westy (California,
cat under rear bumper). All parts (except motor, AVP rebuild) are
original w/125k miles. A few months back I replaced the motor and in
doing so unassembled, cleaned up and reassembled heater box/exhaust
system. I now have some leaks. I know I will have to take apart and work
to flatten and square all the parts to each other. The problem is that I
did this when I put it back together (not as well as I could have,
admittedly) the first time. I will do this again, and work harder to get
it right, but it sure would be nice if there was a product or procedure
to help when the surfaces just don't mate quite right. Is there such a
thing?

Thanks to all!

Kindest Regards,
Chris
78 Westy, the Troublemaker
