&gt; Not to devalue the elegant bottle/needle system, but I have a buddy with a 
&gt; turbo SAAB that has operated for nearly 20 years using a windshield washer pump, 
&gt;
We run 15 gallons of water over an intercooler using a sprinkler with a tiny bottle of nitrogen, that works really good, it is signaled by turbo boost at 70psi.
