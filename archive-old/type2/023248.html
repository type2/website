Subject: my tires arrived...but i still have a question.
Mime-Version: 1.0

okay,
the other day i was asking about tires.  currently, i have cordovan 
185/70R14 on my 1975 Westy thanks to the PO.  so, i bought 4 new 
tires....Yokohama 185R14 Load Class D.

well, they arrived (in lightening speed i might add) yesterday.  so, i'm 
looking at the old tire and the new tire.  the old one (185/70R14) is much 
wider of a tread than the new ones i just bought (185R14.)

are these new tires going to fit on my old rims?  the old rims, i believe 
are original.

please tell me i didn't just kick myself in the head!

thanks

missy:)
