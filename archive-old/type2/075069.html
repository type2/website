Subject: Re: Upper cot

The entire cot with canvas will still be offered for
another day but the canvas has already been spoken for
if nobody takes the whole shebang. Thanks.

&gt; Thanks to Rob Henley for the free sink top for my 69
&gt; Westy! Much needed and much appreciated. So, as to
&gt; prevent the karma factory from going four paws
&gt; north,
&gt; I would like to offer a freebie to the listees. I
&gt; have
&gt; a perfectly lovely upper cot with tear-free, tan
&gt; canvas for 68-72's. As shipping is prohibitive on
&gt; this
&gt; unit, the offer goes something like this:
&gt; If someone would like to pick it up, great! If
&gt; nobody
&gt; needing the whole unit is close enough to pick it
&gt; up,
&gt; I will ship just the canvas to the grand prize
&gt; winner.
&gt; I am in York, Maine. Please p-mail. Thanks.
