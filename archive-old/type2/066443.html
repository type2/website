Subject: Re: Type IV Cases - availability?

&gt;Anyone know about the price and availabilty of _new_ Type IV engine cases?
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine is looking for one for a 914.

Have him give these guys a call:

Automobile Atlanta Inc
505 S. Marietta Pkwy
Marietta, GA 30060-2250

(770) 427-2844

They're an all 914 shop/parts place. Cool catalog too. If they don't have 
a lead on a new case, I'm sure they can give him a source.
