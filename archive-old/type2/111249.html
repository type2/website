Subject: Re: [T2] Painting a Bus

very awesome ... i live about 3 hours from the beach maybe 4 in the bus....
i use to visit there often till i got married and settled down...
even lived there for over a couple of months or so once...

what i might do then is just get the bus painted solid white and take a drive down and spend a week or so after looking this guy up.../

great idea.....
peace!

&gt;&gt; for all those that paint how do you paint a bus Tye Dye....
&gt;
&gt;I don't know how close you are to Myrtle Beach...
&gt;
&gt;At &quot;Broadway on the Beach&quot;, there's an open-air artist who does the most
&gt;amazing things with ordinary spray paint and an odd variety of &quot;tools&quot;.
&gt;Absolutely fantastic scenes and space scapes, things that you wouldn't even
&gt;imagine that you could do with spray paint.  I'm not kidding.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone might have an idea of how to simulate the effect of tie-dying on a
&gt;car, it might be him.
