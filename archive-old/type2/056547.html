Subject: hot start quick fix

Rodney- still puttin'?  My 78 has 194K on it now!  The hot no-start problem
was getting worse (first time kickin' it with a jumper under car wouldn't
let me start it when climbin' back in the seat)- So I pulled one of the 2
upper wires from the terminal and ran a 4 gauge wire from this right thru a
hole drilled thru the body under the bed-seat left of the seatbelt mount.
Using a microtorch, I soldered a push on &quot;male&quot; end plus a VW female
terminal to the 4g wire first, then ran it thru the hole under the seat
from below.   The wire is protected by muchos turns of plastic tape at that
spot; then silicone calk is put over this on both sides so it can't vibrate
around.
Then I wired this end to  a starter switch I had bought for my tractor (see
WalMart, the kind with a plastic key and HUMONGOUS screw on terminals!)-
the other end feeds back to the battery terminal either on the solenoid or
a big wire I already had feeding an Inverter under the seat.  Then plug the
big wire to the upper solenoid terminal, push back on the wimpy + wire from
the ignition switch, and my &quot;never lie on your back again&quot; switch was in!
Yes I could have fed it all the way up front, but I wanted to keep things
short and now my daughter has something to do when it won't start!   Yes
you can feed it right next to your batttery in the engine comp., but I
often carry stuff like bikes back there and wanted something you don't have
to go outside for.  MB
