Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy


&gt; For camper aficionados: is there sensible reason why the interior is
&gt; Westfalia camperized but there is no poptop?

It is a non-poptop Westy. Westfalia made 3 models:
P-21 has no poptop. Has sink, cooler, bed in back, main table in rear, childs
cot in front.
P-22 has poptop. All of above, and bed in top.
P-27 is the deluxe Westy. All of the above plus 2 burner stove, fridge instead
of cooler, front table, storage container/stool between front seats.

That 77 has a few things wrong:
It is white, appears to be originally white because the front interior is
white. Pastel white is correct for the 77 P-21 Westy. But the green plaid is
wrong. Supposed to be yellow plaid. The yellow curtains are correct.
Not sure about the &quot;signature edition&quot; headliner......
