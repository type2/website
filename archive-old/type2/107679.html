Subject: I can't get my reverse lights to work

76 westy

I've tried and tried to get my reverse lights to work, but nothing. The
Bentley doesn't help much. I looked at the wiring diagram and it helps a
little, but not much. There are too many loose wires running around in the
back end- years and years of other POs fixes.

I checked the bulbs with a volt meter, and they are good. I cleaned the switch
on the transmission. I still have nothing.
Can someone give me the run down on the complete system from light to...? I
don't know what is forward of the transmission switch. I'm not very strong
with electrical stuff to begin with as far as troubleshooting goes. I'm to the
point that I will wire a manual switch and just flip it when I go in reverse.

Can someone give me a VERY basic run down of the entire reverse light system-
I know it's in the Bentley, but that doesn't help- I need visuals.

Also, The little relay behind the heater blower fan has a couple of wires
hanging out with no place to go. I have no idea where these should go either.

Thanks,

Nik
