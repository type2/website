Subject: idle changes in neutral on 77 automatic
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9906292123280.2903-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

The title line pretty much says it, I just got my 77 van running
with a totally stock 2.0 L engine which I've rebuilt.  The engine 
runs smoothly, and gives great power.  I have noticed that when I
switch the automatic transmission to either neutral or park the idle speed
goes up several hundred RPM.  Why is this?  

PS I may still need to add some transmission fluid, though it should be
pretty close.
