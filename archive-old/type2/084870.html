Subject: Re: [T2] Westie Brackets?

The brackets on the door pillars - in front of and behind the doors are for 
the child's cot.

The bumper brackets are probably left overs from aftermarket foglights 
somewhere in your van's past.

&gt;hi there everyone..this is my first time posting to the list. thanks for 
&gt;the resource.
&gt;
&gt;anyways..i have a 1970westie. my first vdub.
&gt;
&gt;and i'm curious about a couple oddball parts on my bus.
&gt;
&gt;i've already searched the library and didn't find any clues there, 
&gt;so...i've come to u all.
&gt;
&gt;first off, i have an inside bracket on each side of both of my front doors.
&gt;
&gt;what went here? it looks like it's a factory option. and that they've 
&gt;definately been used in the past. possibly supports for a child's cot?
&gt;
&gt;also i have a strange bracket of sorts on my front bumper on the driver 
&gt;side. and it too looks like a factory option. any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;a gr8ful peace out to u and yours, -chris in E.Oregon
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;btw; lovin my virtually new 1600longblock from BAP.
