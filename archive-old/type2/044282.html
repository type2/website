Subject: [T2] Looking for exhaust &amp; heater help
Content-Disposition: inline

Has anybody heard of 'electric in-line heaters' for buses?  I have a 77 westy that I am thinking of cutting out those useless rusted heater boxes, and would like to replace with a 'engine to muffler' combo.  Has anyone heard of such a thing?

A friend showed me the electric heaters in a catalog about a year ago, but neither one of us can find that catalog now.

Thanks,
Mike
