Subject: Re: Doghouse &quot;weatherstripping&quot;?
&gt;As I anticipate pulling the engine to get a the clutch, I'm making 
&gt;a mental list of things to do. When last I had the thing out, I 
&gt;noticed that the 2-piece vent for the oil cooler had some slop in
&gt;it and had a rolled edge, like there might have been some sort of
&gt;welting there to seal it up once upon a time. Is this true, and if
&gt;so, what can be used for the purpose?

Hi Todd,

You're right, there should be a rubber seal that fits around the top edge of
the lower piece of the oil cooler vent.  You might try WCM or who knows, the
VW dealer might still carry these.  I'm sure Berg sells these but you'd
probably have to place an order of $50 + just to get it.  Another item that
is usually missing, often forgotten, and that I haven't seen for sale
anywhere is the foam that wraps around the '71 doghouse oil cooler.  The
original foam is usually disintigrated and people usually rebuild their
engines without this piece.  I'm not sure if it's there to protect the
cooler from rattling tin or if it serves some sort of airflow purpose.  

If you are looking for other little tidbits to replace, here are some engine
rubber etc. items that are often ignored/forgotten because the engine runs
without them (some of these are missing on my engine and I just never get
around to replacing them).  Unmentioned are the obvious necessities like
spark plug air seals, engine seal etc.

    Oft-Forgotten Parts Checklist (I probably forgot some others...)

1.  The oil cooler foam previously mentioned
2.  The rubber around the top lip of the cooler vent you mentioned
3.  Rubber seal that fits the lip in the front tin where the oil cooler vent
passes through
4.  2 rubber boots that fit over the live terminals atop the generator
5.  2 plastic generator covers that conceal the brushes/commutator
6.  Small rubber seal around the accelerator cable tube that passes through
the fan shroud
7.  Spark plug wire clips that snap into the shroud and organize the routing
of the wires
8.  Rubber boots at the base of the hot air hose on the lower rear engine tin
9.  Rubber boot that fits at the base of the breather tube off the oil
filler pedastal
10.  Assorted rubber grommets (for fuel line through engine tin and brake
vacuum line through
    bulkhead)
11. The asbestos gaskets that fit in the tin at the base of the heat riser tubes

There, now you should be able to place a $50 order with Berg ;).  

Your clutch cable symptoms do sound like weak or broken spring fingers on
the pressure plate to me. 

Good luck,

Ron
