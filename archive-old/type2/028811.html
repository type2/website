&gt; as promised here is the link to my page on converting from later style
&gt; to 72-74 style heating system
&gt; http://people.bu_dot_edu/jbaldwin/heatexchanger.html


A couple of notes here:

First of all, the best option for an exhaust on this conversion is actually
an original-equipment style '72-74 exhaust (unless you are in California
where a cat converter is required, or still want to use an EGR filter, which
the '72-74 setup does not provide for). That is actually the setup that was
used in Europe straight thru '83.  Compared to the U.S. '79-83 setup it is
much cheaper and simpler.  You can even get one in stainless steel, at a
very reasonable price.

Secondly, for those interested in doing this conversion (or for those who
already bought one of my N.O.S. genuine VW right-side 72-74 heat
exchangers), I will have (in about 4 weeks), N.O.S. genuine VW 72-74 LEFT
side heat exchangers, at a very good price.  In addition I will have about
half a dozen more right-side ones (the last I am likely to get), so it will
be possible (perhaps for the last time ever) to buy a complete, brand new
pair of genuine VW heat exchangers (for less than the price of Dansk ones,
to boot).  I will post details and pricing when they arrive.
