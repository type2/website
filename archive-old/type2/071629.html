Subject: Need seat tracks 70 Bus
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

The previous owner of my van chiseled off the seat tracks welded to the body.
I want to put back in the original seats. Does anyone have a parts van and way
of cutting the brackets off for a reasonable price? The bus is a 70.

Regards,
Bill
