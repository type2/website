Subject: Re: Flaps or No Flaps

Granted, I asked this question, but my thinking is along the same lines as
Harmon's on this one, although I am not sold on the &quot;unsealed engine
theory&quot; yet. :-)   I was leaning toward removing them when I posted my
question.

I cannot see the difference between having flaps fully open and having them
removed.  As long as the side tin is on, the air is routed the exact same
direction, toward the heads.  If the flaps are closed, then granted there
is a difference but I think open is open.

And as far as warming up, I let the motor warm up before driving off
anyway, as Muir and most suggest.

Didn't mean to start such a thread, but thanks for the opinions.

Derrick
