Subject: Last year ofr U.S. import of SC/DC trucks?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10101222057420.12460-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Volks,

I received an inquiry about the history of VW SC and DC trucks.  Now I
know that VW never stopped making those models, but because the U.S.  
passed a very high tariff in the late 60's/early 70's, they stopped
importing them into the U.S. I also know that they were imported into
Canada straight thru and that many of those Canadian buses have found
their way south.

What I am looking for is the &quot;official&quot; end of SC/DC import into the U.S.,
with extra points for info on the tariff that ended import.

Anyone?

                           H Steven Dolan
