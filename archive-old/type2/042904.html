Subject: oil leaking

I've been noticing a lot of oil collecting on the left side of my duel port 
just under the oil pressure switch. I replaced it but oil is still 
collecting, it's also seems to be spraying on to the back engine cover metal 
and inside the hood door. Any ideas. Could this be coming from bad oil cooler 
gaskets?
TIA,
        Andy
