Subject: Re: [T2] Why would I get tight valves on 1E, 2E, &amp;amp; 4E?

Nick,

When you put the boots on did you:

Check for proper thermostat/flap operation?
Check for the presence of debri around the heads/cylinders(blocking air 
flow)?

I can't imagine why just 3 valves might be doing that except for the debri 
part.(or spark plug seals not sealing well on just those 3?)

Other than that, it doesn't sound like it's too bad yet.

How many total miles on the heads?

Bottom air deflectors on and tight?(the ones between the cylinders)

Same plugs all around?...yes I know, some of these are silly, but 
IBTDT.

Cheers, dave

Lots snipped here

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Now, after nearly 30 years of driving and maintaining these things, I've
&amp;gt; always found that if there is an overheating problem, it'll be the number 3
&amp;gt; exhaust valve that gets tight over time.  But in this situation, it's all the
&amp;gt; exhaust values except 3E.  Intakes are fine.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Any ideas?  The curious thing is that just these three cylinders are to blame.
&amp;gt; I suppose I'm going to suck a valve at some point but I'd like to know why
&amp;gt; first.
