in looking at bus ads in the classifieds, i see a lot of them have very
recently  rebuilt, new or replaced engines. often these have less than 5000
miles on them. am i being paranoid, or is this something to be suspicious
of?

if i look at a bus with a really new or very recently rebuilt engine on it,
what kind of warning signs should i look for when test driving it?

thanks,
