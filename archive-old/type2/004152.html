Greeting listees,  Three years ago I tried using a Ford starter solenoid for
a battery isolation circuit switch,  it didn't last!  I called a friend who
worked at an RV center and he had a battery isolation relay/switch for $12,
WOW what a bargain.  I hooked a cable to both large posts on each side of it
and connected these to my two battery positive posts.  Then i mounted the
thing to metal (it must be grounded to work).  The small terminal I hooked
up to my ignition switch.  When you are camping (ignition switch is off) the
contacts are open, and you are running your camper off of the second battery
only, and when you are starting or running the engine, then they are
connected!  Works great!    Jeff Adams,  71 Riviera Penthouse

Subject: [T2] Dual battery System isolator vs. separator


&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about adding a second battery to my 77 Westfalia for
&gt; auxiliary camping purposes.  I found a pretty good deep cycle battery that
&gt; will fit on the left side of the engine compartment, but before I proceed
&gt; I'm trying to determine the best way to hook it into my charging system.
&gt;
&gt; Through some research there seems to be two major options, First being the
&gt; diode isolator method.  In this approach two diodes are used to connect
both
&gt; batteries to the alternator / voltage regulator system, available at any
&gt; FLAPS.  In doing this the batteries are isolated from each other and both
&gt; obtain a charge as the engine is running.  I'm not sure if I like this
idea
&gt; considering that a diode is a semiconductor which will knock my charging
&gt; voltage down considerably (~ 1 volt).  Hence the batteries might never
&gt; receive a full charge and the life of the battery might be deprecated
faster
&gt; than normal.  Additionally, I'm not convinced that my 55A alternator would
&gt; be very happy under these conditions.
&gt;
&gt; The second option is to employ a separator,  this system is more
&gt; sophisticated in that it uses relays and a simple circuit that monitors
the
&gt; charge of the batteries.  As one battery becomes charged it will switch
&gt; charging to the second battery.  Because this is a dynamically switching
&gt; system you can also manually switch both batteries so that they are
working
&gt; in tandem to give yourself a jump start or for another similar purpose.
&gt; This system seems to be the way to go, at least with serious 4WD
motorists,
&gt; however  at about $150 it is much more expensive and I have not seen any
&gt; recommended manufacturer installations for VWs.  I suppose the initial
&gt; expense will be retrieved in possible early battery replacement on the
first
&gt; system.
&gt;
&gt; I've checked out the faq which describes how to build your own system.
I'm
&gt; considering doing this but would like to run these ideas past someone who
&gt; has some experience.
&gt;
&gt; I'll summarize all responses and write something for the FAQ once I'm
done.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Brian Goldin
