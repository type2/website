Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

That makes some sense, actually.  Never thought of it before but I  don't work in stock car racing.  Yet.  Thanks...KR

that the airflow actually improved with the spare tire
up front. Any notes on the subject are long gone, sad
to say, but I really did make comparisons. I also
tried mounting underneath with a chain capstan from a
pickup truck, but was unable to really get it where I
wanted it due to obstructions. I'd like to mount it
underneath the nose. It's possible but I never got too
into it  with all the plumbing I have up there now.

&gt; The 77 Westy has the spare attached to the nose ,

&gt; how bad is that for fuel milage ?
&gt;  
&gt; it really takes up too much space inside but what
&gt; else do you do ?
