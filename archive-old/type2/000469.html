Any tips on putting oil in a Type 2 (Vege Engine)

Whatever I do I seem to get it everywhere, is this the same for everyone or is there some magic solution I'm missing :-&gt;
The only thing I haven't tried is little tiny bottles of oil, but this seems to be a pain when I have 5 litres already in the Van.
