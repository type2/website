&gt;1. What would be the best way to confirm that we have a dropped seat without
&gt;doing any more damage?

Compare the heights of the valve stems. Unless they have all dropped by the exact same amount (unlikely) you should have an indication.

&gt;3. Are the 1/2 heads different from the 3/4 heads? i.e. head temp sensor -
&gt;only on 3/4?

They were from the factory but not anymore. I suppose it's possible to get a set of heads from a rebuilder that lack the hole for the temp sensor II but you can always tap it.

&gt;4. Would prefer new head(s) - which brands are available? pros/cons of each?
&gt;      Bus Depot - German Heads - $415 each

New heads from the vendors usually come from AMC in Spain. Where did you see German heads unless they were a unique NOS pair?

&gt;5. What would be the downfall of having one new head and one used head (even
&gt;if the used head was in great condition)?

If you just bolt the head on you might have different compression ratios L to R.

&gt;6. Rebuilt heads - opinions? I am thinking that because this engine
&gt;supposedly had 1500 miles on it when we bought it that they put rebuilt
&gt;heads on the engine and that is why we are having a problem now - there is
&gt;probably about 2500 miles on it now.

YMMV. Some heads fail prematurely because of poor workmanship. Others are great but with the engine out of tune they burn up anyway.
