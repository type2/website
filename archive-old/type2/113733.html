&gt;&lt;&lt; For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it
&gt;as a &quot;new car&quot;....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with
&gt;metallic paint though. &gt;&gt;

What's steep about $11,500 for a new car?  Compare it to all the consumer
crap out there for under twelve grand.

&gt;OK, but the problem is that it's registered as a 19... Beetle. Is $11,500
&gt;the insurable price even as a completely restored 19... Beetle? After
&gt;all, you can't tell the insurance company what it really is, they take
&gt;a dim view of insuring a technically illegal vehicle...

What's &quot;technically illegal&quot; about it?  It's just a registered, whatever year,
frame (legally imported to the US) that's been restored, using new parts.
You would insure it for whatever a restored bug is worth.
