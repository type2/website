Subject: Re: [T2] Shuddering problems...


have you tryed checking if your distributor is adjusted properly?  my guess
is that this is your problem!

- shawn


&gt;So, I just got the bus out of the shop out of 4 months worth of work (body
&gt;and engine). I've run it for 2 days (less than 4 half hour drives) and it
&gt;has run like an absolute dream.  Until yesterday. About 45 minutes into
&gt;the drive home it starts shuddering. It does it mainly if I have the gas
&gt;pedal down a ways. If I push it to the floor, it gets worse. If i let up
&gt;on the gas, it stopped for a bit but eventually started up again. These
&gt;were pretty good shakes too. Lurches more like.
&gt;
&gt;I let it sit for 45 minutes with the lid open. It starts up fine. I drive
the 2 miles
&gt;home with no problems what so ever. Start it up this morning. It idles
fine.
&gt;
&gt;Here is what got done during the 4 months (after the thing sat for 4
&gt;years). New ECU, New AFM, New Gas tank, New Axle Beam, tune up, timing,
&gt;oil change, new injectors, new fuel lines, new hoses.
&gt;
&gt;It's a late 77 bus with a 78 engine. I'm thinking the obviously missing
&gt;duct work (duh) and a new fuel filter might fix it. Any other things I
&gt;should investigate? Electrical maybe?
