Subject: [T2] Slider Windows...

okay,

I really like the slider windows too, i have even acquired a set for my
71.

BUT, be aware that there is a left and a right one, and they are
different!  Either left or right will fit on either side, but when they
are on the correct side the latch for the sliding portion will be forward,
so you can operate it from the front seats.

I have had my drivers side slider for about a year, and just found a
passenger side one a couple of weeks ago... I think they are harder to
find as they tend to a) get sold with the door or b) get broken when the
door falls off at the junkyard and somebody drops a brick on it or drives
over it or c) ???

take care,

Steve
