Subject: Re: sagging rear info

My bus also sags in the rear so that the front is a couple of inches higher.
I guess that I will be doing a rear heightening in about September when I get 
back my singlecab.
Could someone post their results in a webpage when they get theirs (SP?) done 
before me.
TIA
