Subject: RE: [T2] Repair shops in the Denver/Colorado Springs area

Troy,

This is what I know and what my network of VW people have said. This is only
opinion...

Painter's Grinding
Phone: 303-722-5573
Address: 831 S. Jason St., Englewood, CO 80223
Specialty: Engine Rebuilds and vehicle repair
Ups: Can build a longblock for a reasonable price and is local
Downs: Some spotty quality work
Rating: 6
Reason: I have heard he can get sloppy. You just have to watch him closely

Blazer Automotive
Phone: 303-722-3032
Address: 3718 S. Broadway, Englewood CO, 80113
Specialty: Any and all VW Vans and Vanagons
Ups: Local and good reputation
Downs: None Yet
Rating: ? My only experience was they got some friends from Alaska on the
road really quickly when their Eurovan Westy took a 5 cylinder dump. They
let them stay on premises while repairs were done.

Eurosport Automotive
Phone: 303-423-3715
Address: 5615 Lamar St., Arvada, CO, 80002
Specialty: General Automotive Repair. VW, Audi, Porsche. Mostly performance
tuning.
Ups: Friendly staff and good communication with vehicle progress
Downs: Seem to have some personnel issues
Rating: 8
Reason: They were a 10 until they cracked my perfect 1970 DC steering wheel
when doing a shoddy alignment. They did not offer to replace it, redo the
alignment or offer or admit to it. Probably was a bad technician.

BustedBus
Phone: 303-545-5084
Address: Private, web only. Parts_at_bustedbus_dot_com
Specialty: Soft to full restoration work. Typically specializes as a parts
reseller, but he does do quite a few soft restos.
Ups: Specializes in Late Model Bays and has the knowledge to match
Downs: Currently only has part-time helper
Rating: 10
Reason: Always honest and informative. Contact through email only.

Wright's German Motors
Phone: 303-420-2123
Address: 5609 Lamar St., Arvada, CO 80002
Specialty: Full VW and Audi service
Ups: Completely up on Type 2 trivia and nuances. Cheapest found yet.
Downs: Some strange personality issues
Rating: 10
Reason: Did a perfect alignment and some diagnostic work. Fair price
although the front desk guy is a little crusty to deal with.

Injection Labs
Phone: 303-404-0515
Address: 10900 West 120th Ave. #C, Broomfield, CO
Specialty: Aircooled Porsche and VW motors. Fuel injection conversions,
repair and tuning. High performance and Race engine building.
Ups: Incredible knowledge and engineering for engine tuning and building
Downs: Small shop, one employee = a longer than average wait
Rating: 10
Reason: As an engine builder, EFI specialist and turbo specialist, no
Porsche enthusiast &quot;in the know&quot; will take their rig to anyone else.
Expensive, but he might be the only person in Colorado that can build you a
100K+ mile motor. He is also the only builder in Colorado that can properly
rebuild a VW Type 4 cylinder head.

Verner's Automotive
Phone: 303-444-8307
Address: 3280 Valmont Rd., Boulder, CO
Specialty: All VW's, all repairs and rebuilds
Ups: Has a good following and plenty of years of good reviews
Downs: Some recent honesty issues. Hope it isn't a trend.
Rating: 5
Reason: Recent reports have been Verner's is getting very sloppy with Bay
Window and Vanagon owners in particular.

Pine Beetles
Phone: 303-838-7218
Address: Private, BFE, Pine Junction, CO
Specialty: Transmissions
Ups: The only guy in the state to trust your tranny and auto tranny.
Downs: He is really remote in Pine, CO. Hard to get a hold of. Not cheap.
Rating: 9
Reason: Not perfect quality, but 90%. Too remote a location for the casual
enthusiast. BustedBus does a frequent tranny run to Pine, so it is easier to
sub it out through them.

Abra Auto Body and Glass
Phone: 1-888-USA-ABRA (request Westminster Auto Glass)
Address: 9100 Pierce St., Westminster, CO, 80021
Specialty: Bus Glass
Ups: Fast Service and VW Bay knowledge
Downs: You must request a tech that knows buses.
Rating: 10
Reason: They spent extra time to install the glass at no charge. Very easy
to work with and the price was very reasonable.

NuVintage Parts and Restorations
Phone: 303-422-4237
Address: 5595 Sheridan Blvd, # 2, Arvada, CO 80002
Specialty: Bugs and Aircooled parts, interiors.
Ups: Local, good inventory and good hours
Downs: Not really interested in Bay Windows.
Rating: 8
Reason: They begrudgingly did my DC interior, which turned out spectacular,
IF you can convince them to do it.

Denver Bumper Works, Inc.
Phone: 303-623-3610
Address: 830 Wyandot St., Denver, CO, 80204
Specialty: Uh, bumpers
Ups: Will straighten bumpers and mounts, fix &quot;square holes&quot; and will
re-chrome
Downs: Really inconsistent pricing.
Rating: 9
Reason: The only place in Colorado for VW bumpers. It is better to go
through BustedBus since he has fixed pricing.

Twins Autobody
Phone: 720-297-2739
Address: Private, North Denver
Specialty: VW paint and restoration
Ups: The most honest paint guy you will find in the state. Period.
Downs: You have to watch him closely with a bus and let him know exactly
what you want and what your expectations are. Some spotty paint quality, but
he guarantees his results.
Rating: 9
Reason: Complete honesty and integrity. 100% quality guarantee, but pricey.

Mitchell Motors
Phone: 303-794-6269
Address: 5794 Datura St, Littleton, CO 80120
Specialty: Classic Automobile Restoration
Ups: They are one of Denver's oldest Restoration Shops. Reasonable price
Downs: Huge backlog of vehicles. They can be jerks.
Rating: 7
Reason: Just not VW specialists.

Bart's Auto
Phone: 303-931-2317
Address: Private. Englewood
Specialty: Restoration
Ups: Small one-man-show
Downs: Small one-man-show
Rating: ?
Reason: Not enough info to Rate.

Chris Hank Insurance (American Family)
Phone: 303-987-8669
Address:
Specialty: Classic Vehicle Insurance
Ups: Will insure any VW
Downs: None
Rating: 10
Reason: I have used him for all my policies, always cheaper than anyone
else. They love classic cars.

AMC Classic Auto Appraisers
Larry Mitchell
Phone: 303-428-8760
Address: 7963 Depew St., Arvada, CO, 80003
Specialty: Classic Vehicle Appraisals
Ups: The ONLY option if you want a fair appraisal for sale or insurance

money.

OK that taps me out. I won't even include my parts and vendor ratings.

Contact me off-list for specifics.
