There seems to be a lot of confusion/questions related to this subject.
Volkswagen controls definitely aren't rocket science. Bus driver's seats
should have two adjustment controls. Both are attached to the lower front of
the seat. If it's not attached to the seat it's not for seat adjustment. One
is a lever. When lifted the seat can be moved forwards or backwards. The
other is a large black knob. This is turned left or right for seat back
adjustment. 
Directly below the drivers seat is a small knob. When pulled out, a meager
amount of warm air is directed into the rear passenger area. Another heat
directional control can be found below the dash to the right of the driver's
side kickpanel. Push down and heat is directed to the defroster vents. Push
up and heat is directed to the lower vents.
I use a wax like material that is made for lubricating door strikers to lube
the seat rails. I can't remember what it's called, but it comes in a push-up
stick. I got it at NAPA. This isn't as messy as grease or WD-40.
