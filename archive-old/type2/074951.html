Subject: Re: [T2] wheel cease

Hi Ian,

&gt;Sounds to me as if the parking brake has locked up on
one wheel.

I agree.

&gt;The clunking sound you mentioned tells me that it is
much more likely 
to be
&gt;the parking brake. I would recommend having someone
press as hard as
&gt;possible on the (foot-operated) brake pedal and
release repeatedly at 
the
&gt;same time that you hit the offending brake drum a few
nice hard whacks 
with
&gt;a BFH (very large hammer).  The drums are pretty
solid, so don't be 
afraid
&gt;to let out some agression with that hammer.

this is where you have to be careful. I have seen
people bust drums into pieces when using a BFH in the
wrong place on them. the only place you should hit a
drum with a hammer is BETWEEN THE LUG STUDS. dont hit
the lug studs either or else you'll have a heard time
getting the lugnuts back on, and may warp the hub
beneath them if they are composite drums (hub seperate
from drum). otherwise you may definitely warp your
drum (which will cause a pulsating brake pedal) or
bust it apart.

&gt;If this does not loosen it up then you've got to work
on replacing the
lines.

the other thing i would try is taking the wheel off
them put 2 adjacent lug nuts back on. put a pry bar or
somthing between the 2 lug nuts and stand/jump on the
end of it (hold on to something) or beat the prybar
with a sledge hammer to break free. not really sure if
someone in the bus pumping the pedal would really
help, but couldnt hurt.

whatever you do, dont spray penetrant or ANYTHING
inside the drum unless you feel like replacing the
contaminated shoes. this will cause grabby brakes.

just my $.04

peace!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '72 Kombi in *running* condition. I left it
for two or three 
weeks
&gt; over winter (no extreme cold, just wetness so far as
the weather 
went) and
&gt; now it will not move. The engine will run and sounds
and works fine, 
but it
&gt; is as if there are imaginary blocks behind the drive
wheels. I gave 
it some
&gt; gas in reverse and the right rear went &quot;clunk&quot; and I
could feel the
&gt; resistance go away from that wheel. But, no matter
what i try the 
left rear
&gt; is locked. Is it ceased? Could it be transmission or
brake related?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; - Ian
