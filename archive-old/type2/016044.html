Subject: 80 Vanagon overheating
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

I posted on my 80 Westfalia apparently overheating before and now that I have 
an oil temperature gauge, I know it. Down the highway/freeway it indicates 
220 + in our 100 degree ambient temperatures. What really surprises me is the 
way it climbs to an indicated 260 + when on surface streets and idling. My 70 
cools under these conditions. It also has done some missing when really hot. 
It had one instance where it suddenly surged in perceived rpm. I drove back 
to my work location ( I am 150 miles from home and most my tools) and tried 
checking it out. I checked the plugs and all looked fine. I put new plugs in 
and wires as I had them already. I do have the Haynes manual with me. Their 
troubleshoot guide suggests mixture or timing. I have 15W-50 synthetic oil in 
it and its level is right on the mark. I tried adjusting the screw identified 
in Haynes as the place to set mixture. I moved it back and forth with no 
seeming affect and got it back where it started or real close. When I tried 
to test drive it, I had a distinct lack of power and miss. I reparked in the 
station lot. I will tackle it tomorrow while on duty if we aren't busy. I may 
be looking for a good VW repair shop in the Northwest San Fernando Valley of 
LA on Monday. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. It was running 
smooth and had good power before my attempts at adjustment except when it got 
real hot. 
 
Sorry for the long post but I wanted to provide enough information in the 
beginning to save questions.
