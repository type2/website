DON'T LET THE INSURANCE COMPANY TAKE HER AWAY!!!!!! 

Buy her back and fix her.  You'll have a Westy and be money in the bank.
 Change all lubricants, pull the plugs and crank her over to blow out
any water in the cylinders and then fire her up.  Take her to the car
wash and wash off the worst of it.  Pull the cabinets and let then dry
out of the sun.  Put it all back together.  Might take all of two
weekends and you'll save her from the boneyard.

She's not dead, just dirty!
