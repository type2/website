Subject: [T2] some dim alternator light

list, can ya help with an electrical concern? the alternator idiot light
becomes dimly lit with the combination of the headlights on, and either
turn signal blinking. can any illuminate for me? the red light goes on when
the turn signal is pausing, and goes off when the signal blinks. again,
with headlights only.
perplexified,
