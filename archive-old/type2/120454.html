Subject: Re: [T2] crazy turn signal light

Hello Rus,

I think they are suppose to do that. My 68 does the
same things. I thought that it was an electrical
problem until I pulled the dash pod and noticed that
they were wired together to blink at the same time. If
you find out differently, please let me know. They are
not very useful as indicators for the driver. Thanks!

Regards,
David Kelly
