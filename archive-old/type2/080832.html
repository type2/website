Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top web site

Well I am awake, but I don't claim to know which sites are supposed to be in
the archives. Here are 3 that may or may not help:

http://www.poptops_dot_com/

http://www.72camper_dot_com/poptop1.htm

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/canvasre.htm

Subject: [T2] Pop top web site


&gt; Good Morning,
&gt; Anyone awake that would have the web address for  the pop top site?  There
&gt; is a page or two that has all the step by step instructions for removal.
I
&gt; have it on my PC at work, and I have not been successful as of yet finding
&gt; it in the archives.
&gt; Just hoping one of you fine folks have it handy.
