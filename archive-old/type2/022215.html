Comment,
Mary Beth and I have had several occasions to take in road warriors as
they come through Houston on their bus journeys or have road problems.

Evening chit-chat, a few beers, morning breakfast, handing over a few
bucks to those that we could see were on the poor side of town, sometimes
hiding a few dollars on the bus for them to find later so as to not
embarrass. It has all been great fun and warmth.

One thing that often is a source of discomfort as a result of these
meetings is that on several occasions we have failed to receive a card or
note letting us know how the trip went after the bus left our house.

I know it is not a mandate to send post cards or stay in touch, but we
always want to know how the person(s) we helped made out. 

Next time you spend some rest time or &quot;down&quot; time with a fellow busser,
remember to drop that person a line later on down the pike. 
You just might find that it will make everyone feel a lot better about
helping and being helped.

Bob in Houston
