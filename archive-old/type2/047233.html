Jes' can't seem to shut up today...

Attention all listees who've contemplated that first or returning visit
to Black Rock City!!!

Full Contact Croquet League &amp; Nude Bar-B-Que Society is now recruiting
for Burning Man 2001.  We plan to operate in conjunction with the Playa
Game Show Network and Yes Camp to construct a camp of lavish proportions
and unsurpassed hospitality.

THRILL at the monstrous fireballs!  DUCK the oncoming fireworks!  PAINT
your bus (and your campmates) with glow in the dark arcane symbols so
you can find them at night!  CREATE your magnum opus, and then TORCH
it!  SEE Sally at Burning Man 2000:

All inquiries welcome.  Whiners need not apply. YMMV.

Teri
