Volks &amp; Jim Arnott:

The Passat does use 15&quot; rims (now). But it's only the recent
models, '98 and later (I believe).

Since the Breadloaf Bus and the Vanagon have the same bolt
pattern and rim size, one can get a &quot;boat load&quot; of
commentary on rim types and sizes in the Vangagon List
archives. (The archive server is a bit slow, however.)
