&gt; That picture is great for my question, can anybody tell me if you can remove
&gt; the large round black thing just to the right of the voltage regulator? I

it just pops out and snaps back in, use a fine blade screwdriver under an
edge, work it around until it pops free.

&gt; assume that it is there to allow access to the filler tubes, since mine
&gt; should be right behind it. How can this be removed and put back in? Any
&gt; other way to get to the filler tube?

well the Elctronic control unit ECU is behind there too, so you would have
to remove the ECU to get to the filler tube, I replaced my filler tube
when the engine was out and I could also get to it from beside the tank
with the firewall removed.,   but of all the jobs I have ever done on my
bus and I think I have done most of em, this had to be the biggest PITA
job with the highest _at__at_**#*$&amp;_at__at_ language rating...simple job in a gawd
awefull location,  give yourself plenty of time, like all day, and take
your time,, take breaks, and have a 6 ppack cooling for when finally
finished.  and stubby screwdrivers were a blessing, get some new ones 
that are nice and sharp and square and free of blemishes


good luck
