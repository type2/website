I'm not sure of RPMs, but I take my '76 Riviera automatic to 70 (or a little
above if the temp is cool sometimes) or 42-43 going up hills in second (I set the
pedal so it shifts up at 37 and back to 3rd at 42-43, sounds about right).

I have to say, I love having an automatic (7th bus, 1st auto), except for going
downhill on windy roads when I have to use the brakes much more than I would
like.

&gt; folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming near red-line, for any reason? Never
&gt; exceed 60mph? Now I'm very curious...
