my .02 as this thread goes on...

14 years ago as i headed out on a trip ( on 2 wheeled ac) , i had two
good legs. i inspected them regularly and maintained them well. along
the way , i lost one of them due to life, murphy's law or whatever you
believe in. s*_at_t happens.

so , yes, i carry spares and go prepared as needed even tho i maintain
my bus very well. as going thru life with one leg keeps you on your
toes( what's left of them).

so play them as you're dealt them , whatever way you choose.
