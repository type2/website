&gt; &gt; seeing this was a replacement AVP head with less than
&gt; &gt; 7000 miles on it.  it has not been overheated at all
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I would CERTIANLY call AVP and make them aware of this.  I dont know what
&gt; the warrenty is on the heads, but call them anyway.  7000 miles is
&gt; unacceptable.



It's 12 months/12k miles.  I have always seen AVP be _very_ reasonable about
warranty coverage, even to the point of going well beyond what was required.
In fact I've alway seen them give the customer the benefit of the doubt.
The only cases I've seen where they denied coverage were cases of severe
abuse or damage that was obviously due to external conditions.
