&gt; I've got a non-U.S. 69 Westy, and the available schematics in the Library

&gt; I've got 10 fuses in my fuse box, and my Bentley's is in the shop with my
&gt; 73. Can someone tell me which fuse goes to what in the 69? I tried to
&gt; extrapolate from the available schematics, but that didn't pan out beyond
&gt; &quot;the big red wire is hooked up to the far right fuse.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; As I'm trying to troubleshoot my lights (no brake, backup, only left turn
&gt; signal/emergency flasher, one hi-beam out), I thought I'd test at the
&gt; bulbholder with my multimeter. Which setting do I use and what do I look
&gt; for? I tried DC voltage and continuity, and neither one gives me valid
&gt; readings.

Nikki:
This is a case of less is more. I feel the best diagnostic tool for your
situation is a test light (NOT with an LED), just a regular old one with a
sharp probe on one end, a 30 &quot; lead and an alligator clip. If working without
an assistant, it's easier to tell if the test light is on rather than getting
a reading from a dial (especially if you're upside down with your head under
the dash!)
From the German shop manual  I deduce (I could be completely backwards here
as I'm just looking at the schematic):
    1= Brake lights, turn signals, horn
    2= Windshield wipers
    3= High beam left (and indicator light on the dash)
    4= High beam right
    5= Low beam left
    6= Low beam right
    7= Parking lights front, right tail light and license light
    8= Tail light left
    9= Emergency flashers
   10= Radio
Backup light has its own fuse in a holder hooked up to the hot (15) side of
the coil
Test the tops and bottoms of the fuses, if you have power on one end but not
the other, the fuse is bad.
Sometimes these fuses are just no making contact; give them a twirl to make
them seat better.
Hope this helps!
