the auto tranny should not be a problem, since it will automatically
downshift when you need the extra power, in fact it is likely to work
better than a manual in many situations since you won't be tempted to lug
the engine.  

the owners manual does not give any extra restrictions as long as you stay
within the weight limits... I have towed intermitently with my 78 auto bus
and have not noticed any extra problems..

BTW I have no idea how to put a remote tranny cooler on, have looked into
it but design and location of the pump make it very hard.  if anyone has
done it I would love to hear how it was done
