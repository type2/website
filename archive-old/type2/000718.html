Subject: AIRS update
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well i finally got the AIRS site caught back up. Got nailed by the
&quot;christmas rush&quot; of  200  people sittin home on vacation with nothin better
to do except sign up =) Now at over 900 members!
Decided to finally divide California up into 3 sections (north central and
south) in attempt to make it easier. Also added mini maps to each state to
help when your plannin a route and want to quickly figure out where
&quot;Alomoicious, RI&quot; or etc is.
Workin with a guy to make up some stickers and possibly some pins. More to
follow on that
Thanks for all the support
-Wade
