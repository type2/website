Subject: Rusting From The Inside Out
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Folks,
     This probably won't come as a surprise to most: your bus may be rusting 
from the inside out. When I bought my current Westy, a '77, I was impressed 
at the lack of rust along the rockers (doglegs had the usual, just welded in 
a new cab step on the passenger side). Mine (as do most) has a small rust 
hole in the right front wheel well right behind the tire. Using a small 
flexible neck flashlight, I was able to look down the length of the rocker 
panel under the sliding door-what did I see? Rust! To stop this, I took an 
old pump style oil can (cleaned very well on the inside) and filled it with 
Corroless (a product very similar to POR 15 ) and attached a piece of clear 
tubing to the spout, stuck the tube into the rocker panel and pumped it full 
of Corroless, until it ran out the weep holes along the rocker. Did the same 
to the drivers side rocker, as well as the drivers side cab step (which was 
intact, but has a small hole with a rubber plug). Will this stop my beloved 
Westy from rusting any further? Don't know for sure, but I figured it was 
worth a try. Has anyone else taken any steps to stop this? I'd be interested 
in hearing any other ideas. I also started stripping off the crappy white 
paint job that was applied over the original color, Marigold. Not an easy 
job, but the paint is of such poor quality I don't want to paint over it.
