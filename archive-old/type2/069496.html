Subject: RE: Anyone heard of J-tubes to replace heaterboxes on 78?

They work ok on my 1600SP, a little louder that heat exchangers - dont see them on RMMW catalogue for a 78 tho....anyone know for sure?

Has anyone seen/heard/have/know of a company that is selling or manufacturing J-tubes to replace the boxes?
