They are a daughter company of Custom and Speed Parts AB of Sweden. I buy
from them on occasion. They have most of the usual parts you would expect. I
most recently picked up some trunk/engine compartment rubber (Brazilian) for
my '65 beetle project as well as fender beading (Bug pack). Good assortment
of bus parts including sheet metal. T1, T3 and H2O as well.They state that
they also have used parts although I've never tried to purchase any.

Catalogue available in Swedish/English. The price list is separate and a
royal pain in the backside-sorted by part number(sometimes) and in very
small print. Better to call and get prices.

To contact them in Sweden: +46 (0)42 22 59 40 telefax: +46 (0)42 22 59 44
