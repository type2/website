Subject: Re: [T2] No idle/hard restart at operating temp - the saga
  continues... UPDATE

Fixed! I replaced the temp sensor and the fuel filter this evening...
it runs like a top! I drove it around for quite awhile (air temp was
still 95: at 9pm) and had none of the previous stalling or hard
restart issues. Thanks for the advice, and it's always nice to fix the
problem the first time around.
