Hi Steve,

I was telling that to my Godparents just last night. They want a new 
camper and are shopping in the $30-$40K range. ($CDN)

I told them 1990+ campers are an investment that will depreciate. 1990 
and older will hold value, if they're looked after.
  My advice was to shop around and get TWO 1970's campers and equip each 
with a glove box containing $5K in traveller's cheques.

My bus was &quot;Free to a Good Home&quot;, but to anyone else it would have cost 
$3K to make it a runner. I had a rusted out 73 westy donor to pull the 
driveline, trim and interior from, so it was mostly sweat equity in my 
case. YMMV.

What's it &quot;worth&quot; ? I don't care, cause I ain't selling!!!

Happy trails,

&gt; I've been reading along on this and I don't find Doyt's costs way out of

&gt;
&gt; At the same time, consider this thought experiment.  Say you decide that
&gt; the car of your dreams is a showroom fresh 1978 deluxe Westfalia with
&gt; tent.  I seriously believe that if you set your budget at the $40,000 
&gt; that
&gt; a new EV camper would cost you that you could have TWO of your dream
&gt; vehicle and still have money left over.  I do not believe that it is
&gt; possible to spend $20K on restoring a VW bus  (OK, it is possible...
&gt; *anything* is possible :-)
