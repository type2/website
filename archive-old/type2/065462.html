Since it involves a border, I feel that all countries that share that border
should be concerned.  It takes two nations to make a border.  It doesn't take
much to cause conflict between nations, even war.  I'm not trying to pull any
radical strings here.  I often get harassled just because of my vehicles, hair,
stickers, etc.

I make it a point, a little game if you will, to have meticulously correct and 
complete documentation on a clipboard when travelling.  When (not if..) I get 
pulled over, I confront the officer with Vehicle registration, insurance, insurance
receipts, license reciepts, drivers license, voter registration card, social 
security card, a copy of the vehicle title (not negotiable, it's actually a 
violation to drive in Texas with your title in the car!), my shoes are on (it's
actually a violation to drive barefoot, there are sandals on the floorboard for 
this reason) everybody is wearing their seatbelts, and anything else I can think 
of.  My last trip, I had a copy of the US Constitution on the clipboard, as well
as a copy of the US Forest Service regulations (I was going to the Rainbow Gathering,
which is particularly high risk for harasslement.)

I've used this technique a few times, and it always frustrates the police person.
It's important to note that I do not drink at all whatsoever, and I never travel
with any drugs or paraphenalia of any kind.  The reason I prepare this way is because
I know that sooner or later I'll be (illegally) searched, just because the cop is pissed 
but perhaps the unconscious hippies in the van behind me will go hasslefree.
