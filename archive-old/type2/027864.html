Well, I finally got out to take a closer look at the 69 Westy today and 
found the cause of the &quot;sticky&quot; shifting.

I disconnected the tranny at the coupler and it still took the strength of 
THE HULK to move the gearshift. Then I disconnected the front shift rod 
coupler (about 24 inches behind the gearshift) and the gearshift moved as 
free as a bird.

While under there I also noticed that the front shift rod boot (where it 
enters the tunnel) was completely gone and a HUGE glob o' grease -- or 
something -- in prehistoric hardened ooze formation was encrusted at the 
bottom of the opening, resting atop the heater duct, as hard as dried 
roofing tar.

So, I can only imagine that the rest of the grease is like that all the way 
down the tunnel.

Now what?



Also: Do baywindows have M codes like splits? My westy has the plates on the 
passenger side dogleg and the bedseat base, but it looks like a bunch of 
serial numbers. The plate behind the passenger seat looks like vin# and not 
much more.
