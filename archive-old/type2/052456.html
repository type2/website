Subject: [T2] Underbelly gas heater in a '79 bus

Greetings,
     I have a chance to buy a '79 bus (no motor or transmission) with a
under-belly gas heater (BA-6??).  Anyway, the heater system is complete.
What is involved in pulling the heater and transferring the complete heat
system into a '76 Westy?  Also, what is the going price for a complete
under-belly gas heater system?

Thanks,

Stuart Neil
