&gt; What this says to me is a timing problem.

my timing is dead on, Pertronix and strobe 

&gt;  Are your vacumn hoses on correctly?

same places they've been for years
most replaced within the past few years

&gt; Ported vacumn line from the throttle body to the dist.  Vacumn line 

yup

&gt; from the center of the air distributor to the decel valve, FPR (fuel 
&gt; pressure regulator).

no decel valve (PO) and yes to pressure regulator

&gt; What is your timing, idle, dwell set at?  Does the timing advance 

timing at 8btc  dwell 50 (pertronix remember they are set at 50) idle is
where my problem is, won't idle correctly I have been trying to get 950 or
so (Auto tranny)

&gt; when you accelerate (use you strobe light to see whats happening here)

timing advances smoothly to it's full range (stock vacuum advance)

&gt; not sure what it tells me except that after all this work it is
&gt; essentially worse....  my Hydrocarbons went through the sky, Why????
