&gt; 
&gt; Your annual service ritual (the one where you change the hypoid oil,
&gt; readjust the clutch cable 'cause you know it needs it, tighten the parking
&gt; brake cables and so on) should include pulling the CV halfshafts, tearing
&gt; down and relubing the CVs, and reinstalling the halfshafts.

Yow!  That's a lot of work!  I'm not sure that I wouldn't do more harm by
tearing the CVs apart and cleaning than I would by leaving it alone.  It
is virtually impossible not to introduce grunge into the CV in one way or
another if you pull them.

If the grease remains uncontaminated, then it would probably be better to
leave it alone.

&gt; This does three things for you--it makes sure you have nice clean grease in
&gt; them on a regular basis (there is a special CV grease, but Valvoline
&gt; SynPower is also good), it lets you inspect the balls--any marking on the
&gt; balls and that CV needs to go away),

I reinstalled one questionable CV (it had some pitting on the balls) when
I couldn't get a replacement in time.  I put the replacement in the parts
box for when I got around to putting it in.  two years later, I had to
replace that CV's boot, but the CV was still noise-free.  I put it back in
because I was curious about how long it would last.  Six years later I'm
still curious!  My feeling is that if you carry a spare and can install it
on the road then you should leave things buttoned up unless a boot is
torn.

 and it lets you get up close and
&gt; personal with the boots.

If I pull the axle, the boots get replaced. No sense in doing this nasty
job and then doing it again a few months later.

&gt; Okay, okay, it also keeps the bolts from rusting in. Important, but not the
&gt; only thing.
That's what anti-sieze is for!
