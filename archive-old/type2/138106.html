Okay guys, I need some help again on my 71 bus.  The  last two days I have 
been having a difficult time getting the bus in  reverse.  When I think I have 
it in reverse, it's really in second.  I  let the clutch out and it moves 
forward so I disengage the clutch and have to  push down hard and move the stick to 
the left almost touching my right leg and  then it will go in reverse.  Today 
I noticed that when I went to put it in  first I heard a &quot;popping&quot; sound.  It 
sounded like when your knees pop when  standing up after crouching for a long 
time. It makes this sound just  about every time I put it in first.    I 
think this may be more  of a linkage adjustment than the transmission but am open 
to any  suggestions as to what's going on!  Help!
