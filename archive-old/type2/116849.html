Subject: my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

Why do i get comments about my bus relating to Scooby? My bus is not a 
&quot;ScoobyMobile&quot;. I don't want people to sing the scooby song when they see my 
bus.

Arrgh, and also i hate it when people call my bus a van. It's not a van. 
It's a bus.

Thanks for letting me vent,
