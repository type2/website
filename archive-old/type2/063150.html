&gt;
&gt;&gt;All the faying surfaces are totally black
&gt;
&gt;What is a &quot;faying surface&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Is that a verb, &quot;to fay&quot;? Does &quot;fay&quot; mean &quot;to hold a bearing&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;(I am not kidding so if you guys are going to amuse yourselves at my
&gt;expense then at least answer the question while you're doing it. ;)

  I was going to call it &quot;Fey cases and faying surfaces but I figured 
 there were too many PHDs on the list.

 You know that thick comic book on the bottom shelf? The one your 
parents got you but don't have any pictures?

 Mine says fay is a verb and applies to closely mating parts.

 &quot;Fey&quot; on the other hand means &quot;fated to die&quot;

 The word faying surfaces is common nomenclature in Engineering,
Welding and Ship-building. And Type 2 list talk.

 On a more serious note I was just over at &quot;Volkswebbin&quot;
and there is no reference to the type 2 list. Tho Vintagvw and 
Vanagon are there.
 I often refer people to that place to find out how to join.
Saves me having to spell it out. 
 Maybe you could get us added up there?
