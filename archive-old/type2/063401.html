&gt;   A long time ago in my '78, I helped a friend move his dorm loft, which
&gt; consisted of a bunch of 8' 4x4's and 2 wooden bed-sized platforms. those stuck
&gt; out a good 2 and a half feet, for wuite an interesting ride across town...
&gt; :)

I've moved my loft in my '78, and was able to keep everything inside the
bus, tho I did remove the middle seat and fold down the back seat.  Not
only did I get my entire loft in there, but everything else I had at
school too, for the ride home and again this fall for the start of
school.  

Bus holds a lot of stuff!
