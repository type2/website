Subject: Re: [T2] odometer not working - replace plastice gear

&gt; reading the recent thread, seems as though I probably
&gt; have the same problem of my spedo working and odo not
&gt; working.  can you just buy the little gear in there to
&gt; get it working again, I think it would be hard to find
&gt; another working unit for my bus.

The gear is probably still in there but probably in two pieces by now.  You
are going to have to glue it somehow or find a matching replacement part at
the local VDO speedo repair guy's house in his assorted speedo parts bin.

We have a local guy in town, &lt;http://www.speedometer_dot_com/&gt;, but I've been
able to DIY so far and have never used him.

This is how the gear fails: a fracture appears between the teeth and grows
down to the hub until it breaks...

I bet it would be hard to find a gear in anyone's bus that isn't cracked a
little unless it's low mileage. In fact if someone is selling you a bus with
50,000 &quot;original&quot; miles I bet the state of that gear would settle any doubt
as the whether it was 150,000. Of course if you find a broken gear...

This image was from a broken speedo that I stole the face from for my KM -&gt;
Miles conversion.  I noticed the same crack in mine and hopefully
strengthened it a little.
