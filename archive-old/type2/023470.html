I twisted gently back and forth until I could make them turn, then I folded 
one of those rubber jar lid removers around the tube, grabbed on very gently 
with a pair of pliers and pulled towards me until they slid out.  It took a 
while and a lot of swearing, but I removed them all and only dented one 
(which I replaced).  

I have the same motor.
