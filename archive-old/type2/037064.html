There are two ways to keep corrosion at bay. One is a &quot;permanent&quot; sealer, 
and the other is a metal polish. Neither is going to last forever. I have 
heard that Krylon clear coat lasts several years and doesn't yellow, but 
that's just hearsay. I suspect the proper way to go -- and this isn't for 
the lazies on the list ;-) is to polish with a propietary metal polish 
(it should list aluminum on the label) once a month, or at least with 
every oil change. However, the great beauty in polishing the frame with 
rouge is that there is a minimal surface on which corrosion can get started.
