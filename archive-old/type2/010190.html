Hello all you Bus nuts!

***************************************************************************
**************************
new location!   new location!   new location!   new location!   new
location!   new location!
***************************************************************************
**************************
Well, its time again to make plans to attend the premier Midwest VW Type 2
camping event!  We were delighted to host 130 Busses last Fall, and with
the recent BBTA event coverage in the Aug. Issue of &quot;VW Trends&quot; magazine,
the response for this year has already been terrific.  So come join us for
the upcoming &quot;Busses By the Arch&quot; camping weekend sponsored by NEATO &amp;
LiMBO.  This family camping event will feature a gathering of VW
Transporters of all types and eras from all over the USA.  We are looking
forward to seeing both you and your Type 2 amidst all the &quot;Split-windows&quot;,
&quot;Bubble-windows&quot;, Vanagons, Eurovans and other VWs this Fall.

&quot;Busses By the Arch #15&quot; will be held rain or shine on Friday thru Monday,
Sept 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6th, 1999 at a new location for this event!  We will gather
at the group campground at &quot;Indian Creek Recreation Area&quot;.  This US Army
Corps of Engineers group campground is located right on 18,000 acre Mark
Twain Lake , about 30 miles southwest of historic Hannibal, Missouri.  This
is a beautiful Federal run campground with paved roads and pads, and nice
facilities.  Most conveniences are available in nearby Monroe City or
Hannibal.

Henry De Kuyper from VW Trends is planning to attend again.  On both Friday
and Saturday evenings we plan to have campfires, live music, unusual door
prizes, and part swapping in addition to the &quot;site-to-site&quot; socializing and
&quot;Bus-banter&quot; that this NEATO/LiMBO event is famous for.  On Saturday
morning were planning another of our famous Bus caravans over to historic
Hannibal, boyhood home of Mark Twain.  You'll have lots of time to explore
the haunts of his hometown, or tour &quot;Injun Joes cave&quot;.  You wont want to
miss it!  On Saturday night, owners choice awards will be presented in
several Type 2 classes in addition to vendor and participant donated door
prizes.  If you have a neat VW item to donate, bring it along.  On Sunday
youre free to enjoy the lake or visit other regional highlights.  It should
prove to be a relaxed, fun weekend full of great Volkswagen experiences and
new friendships.

The camping facilities at Indian Creek include our own large, private
&quot;Busses By the Arch&quot; group area with many more electric hook-ups (first
come, first served), fishing, water-sports (bring your gear), playground,
huge pavillion, toilet and shower facilities and a nearby boat ramp.  New
this year will be a new, lower all inclusive event fee of $25 for the
entire weekend.  Only VWs  that are registered and camping will be admitted
into the BBTA group area!  Now, please read that last sentence again! 
Campsites within the BBTA group area cant be reserved in advance.  Our
group campground will be opened for arrivals and site selection at about
noon on Friday.  If you arrive earlier, you could stay nearby in the
regular Indian Creek public campground.  Although there will be plenty of
room, the earlier you arrive the better.

Were looking forward to your arrival for a full holiday weekend of
Volkswagen fun.  Please pass the word around to your VW friends about our
NEATO/LiMBO event, and especially about our new location change!  Then wipe
down and pack up those Transporters for the cruise to Mark Twain Lake for
the &quot;Busses By the Arch #15&quot; campout on Sept 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6th, 1999 near
Hannibal, Missouri.

If you need an event flyer (says essentially the same as above) send your
name, full postal address, phone # (and for fun the VW's you own and clubs
you belong to) to:   BussesByTheArch_at_compuserve_dot_com   and I'll get a flyer
out to you as soon as they're back from the printer.

We hope to see you around the campfires in September!

P.S.    Could someone please forward this to the &quot;Vanagon List&quot;, and any
other VW lists that you think would appreciate the updated info.  Thanks!
