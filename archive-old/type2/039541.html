&gt; &gt; I brought it back to the mechanic who said it was 105.105.105.105
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions how to determine the &quot;real&quot; compression?

Uh, buy a gauge and do it yourself?  It's not very difficult or expensive, 
especially on a Vanagon where you have such nice access to the top of the 
engine.
