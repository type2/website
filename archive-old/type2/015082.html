&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I had a kind of strange experience this past weekend. I was driving my 70
&gt;Westy down on Cape Cod Saturday when I suddenly felt and heard a banging
&gt;noise coming from the front end. Oh great, I think, It must be a wheel
&gt;bearing gone or maybe the bearing retainer nut has backed off. I pull over
&gt;to the first available spot and check things out. The left front wheel has
&gt;all the studs backed out quite far. Now, I had done some brake work on the
&gt;front end about 1k miles ago, and I am sure that I tightened everything back
&gt;up when I was done. I am picky about things like that. Has anyone else had
&gt;this happen to them? Not that I'm paranoid, but it just seemed strange that
&gt;all of them were out so far. I only drive it on the weekends, and I think I
&gt;will check them before every trip. Any tips for keeping them tight? 
&gt;
Happened to me once too.  Tightened em up, hasn't happened since, in 10,000
Km.
