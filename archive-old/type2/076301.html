Subject: was fi guru's...the answer

sigh


78 2l fi stock
Parked for 8 years.

The answer to the no power after warm up question was a plugged filter.
Yes, I know I should have cleaned the tank, but just didn't want to pull
it all at the time.....I'm gonna pay for this&lt;grin&gt;.

I have 2 filters on this one since I knew that the tank was going to have
lots of gunk in it.  The first filter was plugged after about 75
miles...went ahead and replaced both filters(the original type and the
aftermarket).

The aftermarket filter(first from fuel tank) was full of crud, but the
&quot;vw&quot; (next in line from the fuel tank) was relatively clean.

After I hooked up the fuel pressure gauge and warmed up for a while, the
fuel pressure went from 30 at idle to about 20-17 before it died(last
night).

The vacuum is 16.5 psi at idle and steady....up to 24 after blipping the
throttle and backing off.

Tonight, the fuel pressure was 32psi at idle.  It held 20psi for 24 hrs,
so I know my injectors and cold start valve(rebuilt/new) are *not*
leaking.

I went ahead and replaced the plugs, wires, rotor and cap this
evening...sounds good and idles good.

Compression was 

90 #3		90  #1
150		150

I think the lifters are causing most of this as it seems to run fairly
well and sounds good if you can ignore the exhaust leak(to be fixed
soonest).

Thanks for all of the responses.
I will see how much mileage the filters get on this next round.

Cheers ,dave
