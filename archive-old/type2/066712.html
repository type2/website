Subject: '71 muffler - stock or extractor?

Advice request coming!

I was crawling under the bus today, wiring the heat exchangers open, and
I noticed that the muffler is indeed as cruddy as it sounds. And the
heat risers are kind of messed up. So it's time to replace...

I see all the ads for extractors, headers, etc. I know you can get an
extra couple of HP, and the engine might run a little cooler if you
lower the back pressure some... my question is, is it worth it? I'm not
desperate for power - I sort of like cruising at 55 - and I'd rather not
have a hassle installing it; on the other hand, the my engine runs kind
of hot - I don't think the last rebuilder cared about octane levels,
compression ratios, etc. - and I'd like it to run a little cooler so I
can get another 20K out of this engine before a rebuild. 

So what's the price/convenience/performance ratio on this? And where
should I buy it from?

Many thanks,

Anton
