Subject: Re: [T2] Altenator

Jim, 

I don't have my later bug manual in front of me, but I'm going to take
stab at this for you.  Subject to correction by the more informed...

Before we go any further.  You need to confirm how what terminals you
have on your alternator, or a part number marked on the alternator.  I
don't think it has been established for sure that you don't have an
internal regulator and therefore need the external one.  My internal
regulator alternator is something like a AL82X and has two terminals
plus a ground.  One is the large lug with nut marked as B+ and the other
is a push-on marked (I believe) 61.  B+ (BIG RED WIRE) goes to battery
and 61 (thin BLUE wire) goes to the idiot light.  If you have a DF and a
D+ (lug?) terminals, then I think that would indicate an external
regulator alternator. That one should be marked AL75X

&gt; What are the 2 wires on the B+ terminal on the altenator?
&gt; One is a heavy gauge Red &amp; White wire - I am told and am pretty sure it goes
&gt; to the POS Battery, but do I wire it directly?

This would be correct if it's an internal regulator.  It is the wire
that charges the battery and supplies the rest of the system when the
alternator is carrying the load. However, it it's an external regulator,
neither of the terminals go to battery.  Both go to matching terminals
on the regulator.


&gt; 
&gt; The other is a small black wire - I have no idea about this one. I thought
&gt; it was for the light in the speedo, but the wire for the light appears to
&gt; plug in by the VR (in a connector on the D+ wire) and not the Alt. Also on
&gt; the wiring diagram I looked at for a 74 Beetle, it has a 14 in an orange
&gt; cirlce at the other end. I do not know what that orange circle refers to.

The numbers with circles around them on the wire diagram go to the test
plug (T20) and a black wire with the number 14 is the correct one for
B+. The note on the wire diagram is under the title &quot;Test network&quot;.


&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, am I correct about where the wire plugs in for the idiot light? In
&gt; the connector for the D+ wire.

If you have an external regulator, then the idiot light (little blue
wire) goes to the regulator &quot;61&quot; connection.  
 
&gt; I really should have paid more attention in my electronics classes.

Don't worry, it probably wouldn't help a lot, even for reading the
diagrams.  Different language than my electronics. (now 27 years
experience).


Good luck and ask if this raises more questions.  I'll give it a try.
