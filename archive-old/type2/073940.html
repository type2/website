Subject: Gas Tank Issues

&quot;First I noticed that when the tank was over half full, gas
spilled out(the bottom) of the passenger side of the
vehicle whenever I made sharp left turns at speed. I popped
the engine lid and to my dismay saw gas running down
the inside wall(and coming out the bottom of the
vehicle). what the hell is going on here!!!???&quot;

I too have this problem, specifically when I fill the tank.  For some
reason, the pumps here in NJ don't register when the tank is full
and I end up having gas spew out of the driver's side bottom.  I=20
Don't fill the tank past 3/4 and that seems to address the=20
issue, although there are still fumes.
