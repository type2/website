Subject: Lights

So I'm on my way to WalMart this evening and Some doof in an SUV is coming
at me with his brights on full. I go to flash my brights and pull up on the
switch arm *click* the brights are on.
*Click* again and the brights are off. Then the low beams go ff for maybe
half a second, then they come back on, then they go off, back on, off again,
then back on and they stay on. The panel lights stayed on through all this
and nothing else seemed to be affected. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Dave
