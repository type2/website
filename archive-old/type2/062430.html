Subject: clattering '72 noise--further investigations

well, i did some more digging:

the compression is still 130psi all around, with or without #4
functioning

#4 has miraculously come on line after i played around with the plugs

the plugs all have a pretty good colour

i looked at the valves; the rockers are not broken, they are adjusted
pretty well, and both go up and down when the engine is running

furthermore, when i disconnect the #4 plug wire, the noise goes away,
instantly, and can be reinstated upon connection of the wire.  this
leads me to believe that it is definitely combustion related, but what
is it?  it kinda sounds like an exhaust type thing, but more metallic.

are there any more tests i can do on this thing--so far compression,
timing, vacuum all test out okay.

arrrrrrgggghh!  this is really becoming annoying.  

help is always appreciated.
