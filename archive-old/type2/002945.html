+AD4-It has done 93,000 miles but the first problem is an oil leak that only
seems
+AD4-to occur on the road but it drips onto the exhaust somewhere and creates an
+AD4-awful stink in the cabin. Any common causes I can investigate?


Pull off the two tin plates which fit between the heat exchangers and engine
block and you may be able to get a better view. The most popular causes at
least on my van have been push rod tube seals, valve cover seals and fuel
pump seal. All relatively easy to fix. Hopefully it won't be the crank as
that is a big job.
