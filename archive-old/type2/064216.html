Subject: Price of a barn-door bus?

Saw this on the vw.aircooled newsgroup this evening...
Somehow I doubt he really has found a barn door (indicators?
fresh air intake unit?) -- I suspect he is confusing the term with cargo 
doors...
Anyway, thought you might be interested.

g6ya_at_unb_dot_ca wote:

&gt;I found a barn-door panel van bus in the junk yard and am wondering what it is 
&gt;worth if it were spotless. I also need to know the year of it. It has nipple 
&gt;type front signals, small rear window, small rear stop lights, horizontal 
&gt;cooling lines on the rear and some kind of liitle compartment or something 
&gt;between the heads of the driver and the passenger.


Could you could have the 'air-conditioning' unit as an optional extra 
before 1955? In which case, would there be an interior unit similar to the 
later split ones ?? Thom and/or Clara will know...
