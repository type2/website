Subject: Questions on a 72 Westfalia

I'm helping out this guy by email with his 72 Westfalia and he has a few 
questions for me, some I will be able to help him out with, and some I can't.  I thought 
the members of the list might have some information I don't have. His email is 
soyboy_at_sprynet_dot_com if you want to email him directly or mine is tiwatson_at_lynx.neu_dot_edu
Thanks for all the help.

&quot;One question I remember is, do your tail lights have amber colored turn signals?
 Mine has red on the driver side, and amber on the passenger.  I bought a used lens to
replace the driver side.

Have you ever torn down a drive axel?  I need to replace the CV boots, and the book
says not to put back on the washer type thing behind the cv joint (know what I mean?)
Do you go by the book, or do you put the washer back on?

I heard from the user group from a guy who suggested I checkk the Haynes Porsche 914
manual for engine codes.  The manual does describe engine codes for the 1700 cc engines
starting with EA (His starts with EA which seems to be from a type 4 412 VW).  But there 
is a discrepancy in the description of where I am to find the engine code on a 1.7 l .  
My engine code is in a place better described by the book where an engine code from a 
2.0 moter should be.  Any more clues would be great.

I would like to know basics for my engine, i.e.  what plugs do I use?  Do you run 20w50
oil in your bus, or 30 wt or what?

I am guessing that the valve clearance for my motor is .006 inches.  What about you?

If I have a 2.0 motor, I think the valve clearance would be different.

I am guessing that the dip stick in my motor is not stock.  It looks like a FORD symbol
on it?!?  I have no idea what the carb. is.  I see a bunch of numbers on it, but no
name.  A guy at a NJ VW shop named a couple of different carbs that people use,
including some US makes, i.e. Ford.

The rear engine compartment lid has been replaced with I don't know what.  I'm quite
sure it is not stock.  I quess it's no big deal.

What size tires do you run on your bus?  I think what is on mine now are 195/75r14.
The tires are all different, with different amounts of rubber on them.  I would like to
eventually get new ones, or some aftermarket rims, i.e. 15's.  Any hints?

There appear to be AC hoses running from the engine compartment to the front, beneath
the driver side dash. Was AC an option?  There definitely seems to be no compressor on
the motor, but, this is not the original motor.

Also, someone added a second fuel tank, bolted on the undercarriage in front of the
trans.  Was this also an option, and if not, I guess someone figured out how to add it
without causing too many problems.  It seems to hang a little low.&quot; soyboy_at_sprynet_dot_com
