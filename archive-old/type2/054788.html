shelby-
the thread is indeed 9mm- there is no 9.5.
www.timesert_dot_com
lists this size, and i believe the helicoil for an 8mm
bolt may be 9mm o.d. , and they may supply a tap
special for that, none of which will help you, since your
head is more than likely trash by now...why not weld it
and then tap to the stock size ?
