Subject: re: warming up the van...

well, if it's cold outside i'd definitely let the van heat up. otherwise you
may be putting some rough wear and tear on your engine. even in north carolina,
when it gets chilly (like it is nowadays) i let the engine warm up for about
5 minutes. but when it gets really cold (to me below 32F) in the morning i
usually let it warm up while i drink my last cup of coffee. of course, i'm
talking about an engine with a carb and yours is fuel injected. still, it
can't hurt to give your engine a good amount of time to warm up when it's
cold. it may extend the life of your engine.
