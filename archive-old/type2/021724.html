Subject: Re: [T2] aux. battery wiring...still

From memory (I have a 78 Westy deluxe)
The Deluxe Westy switch panel for the fridg. and spare battery is just a
single pole double throw switch to move the fridge blue wire from either
the spare battery + or the converter + (14 volts).  The &quot;charge&quot; timer
switch connects the converter to the battery to help charge the
battery.  The voltmeter hooks to the battery + (and ground) to let you
have an idea of the health of the battery, to see if it's being charged
via the relay, or if it's being charged by the converter.  
     The stock relay was screwed to the wall just before the left
parking light assembly.  It has a primary curcuit powered from your
ignition + terminal on the coil and going to ground by a brown wire
being screwed right to the same wall.  When it gets current from the
coil (key on) it shuts the relay and acts like a simple switch to
connect a wire (about 12 gauge) from the spare battery + to the positive
on the main battery. If it has side terminals you can use those for the
extra wire, using small cap bolts with the same thread (5/16&quot;??). Any
relay will do if it is rated at 12 volts, can carry the amps your wire
will handle,  and for being CONTINUOUSLY ON.  Bus Depot sells the Hella
relay kit.     
    Me, after the relay burnt out, I used the largest capacity (amp
hour) battery that will fit in both sides, and wired them together with
the connecting wire so they are in series and give twice the usable
accessory time.  I use an in line digital voltmeter (plugs into lighter
outlet) to let me know when the voltage drops to 11 under load and then
start the bus.  My normal habit is to keep the fridge on when driving
(IO got rid of the ammonia frig, put in a 74 triple seat bed, and have a
removable electric fridge), and disconnect it if there is no house
power, keeping ice in it.  I have one of those devices that plugs in
line with my biggest drawing device (4 amp frig) and cuts the power at
10.5-11 volts, available at a good FLAPS or any RV shops. This saves the
batteries when stopping for 3 hours to check out a tourist spot.   When
camping with no hookups, I carry a small spare starting battery that
fits in the sink cabinet as insurance.
