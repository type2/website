Subject: Clarification on Weber 32/36

Hello again list,
	I thought I would clarify some things about my current setup. I am
running a 1700 CC type 4, pretty stock, new heads, compression 120 all the
way around. The carb is a brand new Weber 32/36 from
www.webercarburetors_dot_com. It makes no difference whether the brake booster
line is plugged or not. Otherwise, the only other vacuum line goes to the
Bosch Vacuum Advance Dizzy. I've also used two other 009's w/ vacuum line
plugged. The coil is the third I've tried. The spark plugs is the third
set of Bosch's. The plug wires are the second set of Bosch Plug wires. The
entire ignition system is brand new, and timing is dead on with a max
advance of 32 BTDC. The primary metering jet is now a 140, it was a 137.
That seems to have helped significantly. The secondary jet is a 140 as
well. The primiary idle air correction jet is a 50, and the secondary 60.
The ignition spark is a very healthy bluish white, so I really don't
expect it to be a problem. The valves are adjusted properly, with even,
and pretty good compression.

It seems to have a miss at idle, and sounds quite like the racing cars
with a high lift cam, although this is a stock engine. The most
frustrating problem is when I put my foot on the gas, the engine boggs
down severly and then goes, and not too well.

Thanks again for listening.

John
