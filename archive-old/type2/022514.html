Well, I am about to embark on my first significant repair of my bus and I
could use all the help I can.  I have a '73 with a '72 engine put in by a PO.
I have been smelling fumes in the bus, especially after filling up.  After
seeing all of the warnings on the list, I decided to take a close look at it
today.  Well, heres what's up.

After removing the tin covering the fuel tank, I noticed that the rubber hose
connecting what I believe is the fuel vent to the tank appeared to have a
leak.  Although I could not see any cracks, there also was some residue on the
lip of the tank below it.  I then looked under the vehicle where the fuel
enters the pump and noticed a lot of residue on and around the exit.  The fuel
line, though clamped, was not tight and could probably be removed by just
tugging on it.  What is disturbing me most is the fuel pump.  It has three
lines connected to it, one from the fuel tank, one going to the engine
compartment to the carb (I have a single carb conversion) and one that leaves
the lower part of the pump.  Then line the goes into the tin under the engine
and ends.  I don't know if fuel is exiting out of this port or what.  Can
anyone please tell me if these things are of concern and what do I need to do
to fix them?  I don't want a fireball on my hands.

I am also reconverting the bus back to dual carbs (Solex 34 PSDIT's).  Anyone
know of any good pictures showing the installation of these on an engine?  I
have found plenty showing the breakdown of the carbs, but not the connections
while on the engine.

Any hints on anything about this is highly, highly desired.  I am new to the
vehicle repairs and I want this to go right.  I am trusting that Muir is right
in saying that these repairs can be completed by a compleat idiot.
