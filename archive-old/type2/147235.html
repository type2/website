Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

Really? Wow, never tried brake fluid on it. It's been exposed to oil and gas
 but not brake fluid. Will have to try this out. But realistically, how
often is brake fluid going to spill on the pan of a VW?

Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal
 
I love por 15, but it's not &quot;inderstructible&quot; I was sad when i saw how it
got soft and loose after it was exposed to brake fluid due to a brake line
leak.
Good but not perfect.
