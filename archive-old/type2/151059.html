Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Carbs

Michael,

Ok, basically what you want is something that works...Fi not an option.

*If* you keep your bus in Alabama, you can probably put the weber 
progressive on it.

The problem is this....some of these carbs are for the &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; crowd 
who are willing to put up with a little pain in order to get the 
power....and to pay the big bucks forthe &amp;quot;performance part&amp;quot;.

The general probem with a single centermount on your bus is carb 
heat...you will never be able to live with it in a cold climate as it will 
start freezing up on you....and when you get down in the 30's in alabama, 
you will probably be walking.

So, what I hear that you want is something that just works well for 
everyday driving.

The only other thing I can think of would require dual carbs....would work 
much better in the winter, but then you have to buy linkage and *TWO* 
carbs instead of just one.

You can get those here:
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=C13%2D43%2D5207
+ carbs.

Or the dual Kadron set up which would be about the same.

I've seen somewhere that someone made a kit for the T4 engines for them.

http://www.aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=FSC0014&amp;amp;cartid=
+ carbs

Tell John at aircooled what you want and it will arrive set up and ready 
to go for *your* engine.

Price varies, your mileage *will* vary.

Forget the 34pict-3 on a T4 engine.


Good luck ,dave

 OK..OK..  I won't get into the whole carb vs. fuel injection debate on
 the later model 70 buses.  I know the consensus is that the fuel
 injection was the best thing in the world.  However, that isn't an
option with me (mine is gone on my '76 and I can't afford to replace
 it).
 
&amp;gt; As I understand it, the other options for these buses is dual carbs or
&amp;gt; the Weber progressive single in the middle (which is what someone had
&amp;gt; put on mine).
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; So, is it possible to put a common carb like the 34PICT-3 on the single
&amp;gt; (formerly Weber progressive) setup?  What other options (especially
&amp;gt; single carb) would exist for these later 70 model 2000cc engines?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Thanks,
