David at BugJunction sends:

&gt; Is there any way to remove the gas tank in a 79 bus without having to pull
&gt; the engine?

They tell me you can remove all of the accessories from the engine to give
yourself clearance, but dropping the engine will be quicker. And remember,
you don't have to take it out from under the car...drop it to a little
stand, do your gas tank stuff and put the engine back in.
