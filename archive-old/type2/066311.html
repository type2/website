Hello all.  Below are the classifieds from the Sunday Washington Post,
in no particular order (well, sort of).  I know nothing more than what
the ad says.

'90 Vanagon GL, auto, 7-passenger, good cond, 76K mi, Manassas.
703-369-2277.

'90 Vanagon Carat, dual a/c, dual heat, excel cond, beautiful maroon,
90K mi, $10,500, 703-836-1366.

'90 Vanagon GL, 5-speed, a/c, like new, $5450.  AF 703-525-3783.

'87 Vanagon GL, 116k mi, auto, grey, $3000, needs some work,
301-871-6409.

'85 Vanagon, 68K mi, good condition, runs great, $3300, 301-365-2533.

'81 Vanagon Westfalia deluxe edition, 17K mi on new engine, $3500.
410-313-8593.
OK, I looked at the Vanagon above.  It is located in Ellicott City, MD
and it's not a bad bus.  Top is mildewy but canvas is in really good
shape, interior is nice, there is a lot of surface rust (little spots
but a lot of little spots) mainly under the windows, some rust-through
on the bottom of the sliding door.  Interior is OK, everything seems to
work, front seats have been recovered with some generic vinyl
seatcovers, they don't fit too well.  The rear seat has three different
cushions, the lower one (that you sit on) is the same generic black
vinyl as the front seats, the seatback is a tan cloth and the cushion
over the engine is covered in a brown cloth.  The upper bunk is in good
shape and all the camping stuff inside is in good shape.  There are a
couple extra lights installed that look factory but I haven't seen them
in other Westies plus a nicely installed electric 12v fan that has a
nicely installed pull-chain to turn it on and off.  It's an overall nice
bus but not $3500 nice tho the owner said he is not firm on the $3500
price.  It's got a little too much rust for my taste so I will pass on
this one.  

Other VWs:

rust, paint excellent, must see, serious buyers only, $6995,

'78 Karmann convertible [I'd like to see that, seeing as they
stopped production in '74.  Maybe a European model?  Wait a minute, the
ad says Karmann convertible, I guess he means a '78 Super Beetle
convertible, which has the little Karmann badge on it.  My fault],
