Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leak

That sounds like a great idea, I'll try the feeler gauge method.
A few weeks back I bolted the muffler and heat exchanger together
(without the gaskets) and filled down the high spots but i remember
being able to see through, as in the feeler gauge would fit the flange
gap in many places. It wasn't a large gap though, although i know
its more of a concern now.

As for your question about torquing the nuts to spec. I've got this
wimpy 4 inch wrench so I can't get much leverage. Now I only use that
on the top nuts as any other wrench is to long and wont fit without
smacking the tinware. On the two lower nuts I can fit a normal sized
wrench on and get proper leverage. I'd of used my torque wrench but
it won't fit into the opening behind the nuts.

&gt; Try bolting the muffler to the exchangers without gaskets and tighten 
&gt; everything up. Using a feeler gauge, work around the joint searching 
&gt; for openings. If you don't find them with the feeler gauge (and I 
&gt; suspect you will), then use a very fine needle.
&gt; 
&gt; Somewhere in there, the flanges aren't meeting. Are you torquing to 
&gt; specs?
