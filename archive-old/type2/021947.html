Anybody know where I can buy, trade or get a tent for the rear hatch area? I
saw a picture of one and could never track it down.  To all those who asked
about the &quot;PACE&quot; flag, I am still trying to work out the logistics of
getting these. I suppose I could also use some replacement snaps as well.
Thanks for hearing me out.
