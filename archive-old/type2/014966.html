Subject: Massive oil leak

Roconante got towed home tonight.  The '72 1800cc engine has but 3,514
miles on the total rebuild.  The engine has not used or leaked any oil
since the rebuild.  After a cold start the oil light comes on about 100
yards down the street.  I shut down the engine immediately.  By the time I
get out and walk to the back, there is a quart of oil on the ground.  I add
two quarts then restart the engine for 20 seconds; the oil light never goes
out; now there are three quarts of oil on the ground.  Oil is streaming,
not dripping, streaming from the area of the oil cooler/oil filter.

Suggestions?
