Or you could take the glove box cardboard and support strap out completely 
and cut a piece of plywood to fit onto the inside lip of the dash at the 
back and onto the metal air duct at the front turning the whole right side 
of your dash into a glovebox.  I did this...

I cut the biggest piece of plywood that would fit into the glove box opening 
while still being wide enough (measured front to back) to rest on the front 
metal air duct and the lip of the inside of the dash.  I had to remove the 
centre and right plastic airducts and cut the wood piece to fit around these 
when they were re-fitted.  I then stapled a plastic lip on the left and 
right sides of the plywood to stop things from falling out when I take 
turns.  I have glued green fuzzy felt to the wood to give it that OEM feel.  
My glove box is now big enough to hold my Rand McNally flat on the bottom 
along with all kinds of modern conveniences.  I'm toying with the idea of 
screwing a CD shuffler into the bottom so tunes will be right there for easy 
access (that is, if I ever get this engine in my spare bedroom rebuilt).

&gt;  . Anyone got one?
&gt;
&gt;If you have the old one you can make a new one via the
&gt;paper mache method.
