Subject: Re: [T2] fiberglass dash

Hi Richard,

Here's my Dad's answer, he built this for his Vanagon westy to house 
his Nikon, CD,s and toll change.

DEFINITELY a one-off, but repeatable if someone wanted a clone made. If 
someone wants to pursue that email gord_AT_pottsfamily_dot_ca. He and mom 
are tripping south to Florida with the Vanagon in a few weeks, so an 
east-coast delivery wouldn't be too hard to arrange. We'll also be at 
Everybus in April.

In the second pic you can see the gimbaled cup-holders neat the shift 
lever. Using those you never spill a drop!

Happy trails,

&gt; This is one of the coolest accessories I've ever seen for a Vanagon:

&gt; It looks like a custom one off but I'm not certain. Can anyone with 
&gt; fiberglass experience give an idea of how much work it would take to 
&gt; create something like this for the baywindow?
