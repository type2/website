Hi, folks--

Sorry to suck up the bandwidth to reach someone who's probably within five
miles of me right now, but I unwisely deleted the recently-posted list of
FS buses from the Oregonian and Willamette Week--I wised up only after the
point made by some list member that it's a good thing to have handy for
insurance purposes.  Could the original poster send me another copy
off-list if it's still available?  Thanks.

Shameless attempt at obligatory bus content:  

Several weeks ago I posted about my engine suddenly losing power and
getting noisier--and the local VW place that made a straight-faced offer
of $3400 to replace the engine. Well, that place is no longer in the
running, but I've got a guy I trust who's going to go over it with me and
give me his best appraisal.  To get ready for that--and not sound like too
much of a rookie--I checked the valves and brought them in a little,
checked points and plugs, and rebuilt the carb. I also set out to do a
compression check, but that's when I found that the plugs for #1 and #2
were REALLY jammed in there.  [I pulled, checked, and replaced them 3
weeks ago.] I used a lot more elbow pulling than I used to put them in,
but they still didn't break free. I didn't feel lucky/crazy enough to
force them.

Advice is welcome--what's it all about with plugs #1 and #2?  Plug tips
didn't look bad when I pulled them before.  I suspect I've lost a lot of
compression in #1 and/or #2 but can't tell until I get the plugs out.

thanks
