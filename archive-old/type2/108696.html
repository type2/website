Subject: Re: FRONT Window Defogger Idea?

&quot; I was considering
breaking the vent wing, but then another idea struck me.  I unzipped my
trousers and directed a stream of warm steaming urine at the door handle.
Well, it wasn't pretty, but it did melt the ice and I was able to open the
door.&quot;
