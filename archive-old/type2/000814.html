&gt; Just wondering who all these people are that own Busses,,,,
&gt; Kind-of a what you do for a living that you can afford to drive these
&gt; things????

I'm a self-employed IT consultant (living/working in The Netherlands). I run
two of my buses as a 'company car'. That means that for every dollar I spend
on the car the tax man returns about 60 cents. Hey, not a bad deal!

Having one bus is OK, however as soon as you have two they tend to multiply!
