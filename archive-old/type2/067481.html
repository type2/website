Subject: Help w/ Jetta purchase

I know, this isn't bus related, but I know there are some Jetta owners out
there too, and I need some advice!  My daughter is looking at a Jetta diesel
today (she doesn't even know the year...)  as she needs a daily driver for
school.  She loves the mpg, the body is dinged up and interior is so-so.  Now
I have never even _looked_ at a diesel engine - what should she be looking
for besides standards like compression, transmission (it's a shift) odo
miles, repairs done...?  Is the Jetta a good sturdy vehicle?  Asking price on
this (&quot;it's a '70-something&quot;) is $1500...

I'll know more later today...

TIA
