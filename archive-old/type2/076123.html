Subject: Shift Plate 75-79

Does anyone know where I can get a shift plate for a 1975 bus?  It's not the 
same as the 69-74 and I've tried a few place and with no luck.  Maybe 
somebody has a good used one?

Also, not type 2 related, but does anyone know have or where I could get a 
good front clip for a 74 super bug?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!!!
