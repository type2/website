One of the areas of interest on my '63 crew is lowering some of the inherent
design risks in the drivetrain.  More specifically, risk that I made a
mistake somewhere :)

I'm sure by now I'm well established as a novice on all things mechanical.
I'm doing my first tranny swap, first engine longblock up assembly, and so
forth.  There is always that wonder if you didn't do something right.  Some
not so obvious... other more obvious.

This is an all new Mexican longblock, new carbs, new alternator, all cleaned
and painted tin, new muffler.  You get the idea.  Nice to work with clean
parts during assembly, but then again -- I'm still new at this and trying to
make my

Even found a Hoover Bit (bracket around oil cooler).  Decided to get real
sophisticated and even see if I could put together a thermostat system!
Started to think back to the discussion last year about thermostat failing
open or failing close.

Starting thinking more about the fact that I'm doing a lot of critical
tasks, and you know -- what if the thermostats failed.  Maybe just because I
used the wrong kind of paint and it melted and gunked up the flaps?  That is
the type of mistake within reason of a novice...

Then I remind myself that this is why I put the oil temp and oil pressure
gauges in... if I were cruising the highway for hours, I tend to watch these
and would notice a failure.  But quick enough?  And what about having
someone else drive... do I make them keep there eyes on gauges just because
of the fact I installed myself and could have made a mistake?

 == Engine over-rev ==

First comes to mind is a governor to prevent over-rev.  Either it be a
missed shift, broken tranny, failed clutch... you get the idea.  However,
I'm going with dual carbs.  Electronic ones that work with the distributor
seemed best choice, and I'm going to experiment with one.  I'm curious if
anyone has gone this route... the one I have looked at should work with any
type of dizzy, and it just cuts out points trigger until RPM drops back to
set level.  So far, I've only found such devices intended for racing and
they aren't cheap.  Anyone know of such a device for under $100?

 == Engine overheat ==

Second is overheat warning.  I have stock VDO gauges, which don't even have
a red line on them.  So not only does a guest driver have to watch this,
they have to know what &quot;too hot is&quot;.  Then my memory comes back to the
$11.00 Gene Berg dipstick device that you wire to your idiot oil light.  It
flashes as it nears 230/240 and goes on solid at 240 (degrees F).  Ok, that
is a warning... but do you always notice that little red light?

So then I realized how simple the Gene Berg devices is... all it does is
provide an open ground then closes to ground when the temp is too hot.
Entirely mechanical (expanding metal rotates part of stick to touch a
conductor on the case).  Who says I can't go get a 12v buzzer and attach
this ground wire instead of the oil pressure light.  Nothing... that will
work.

And this would be a buzzer that only comes on when there is a problem, not
like annoying car buzzers that comes on every time you get in.  I will just
make it part of maintenance to check and test (short out the sender wire)
every month or so.

 -- yep --

Paranoid -- yes.  I'm a real novice at all this, and I enjoy the
satisfaction of a job well done.  Then again, I'd also hate to loan the
truck to someone and have them blow the engine.  Especially due to my lack
of experience...
