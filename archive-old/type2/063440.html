Subject: Re: What's the biggest box you've fit in

Well, the biggest was one of those giant fold-a-bed couches that we put
sideways across the roof, and ran ropes all the way down under the bus and
back up- looked just like an airplane heading down the road.  For the
mostest weight, we once moved (NJ to Syracuse NY) and carried all 1000 of
our 12&quot; records along with God knows what else (back in '73) in our 71`
Westy; may expain why ever since then  the rear wheels toed out at the bottom!!!!
