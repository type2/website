Subject: Free Westy pop top in NH

Bussers,
I have a 1970 vintage Westy poptop roof free if you need it, please not for
resale.  It's all there, currently mounted.  Needs canvas.  If you help me
remove it, you can take it away.  Other Westy stuff, including Z- Bed and
rear facing bench in green vinyl available at reasonable cost.
