Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Relay Testing

Find the in-line fuse holder on the left side where a second battery would be.
On the back end will be one black wire going towards the back of the bus, the
other wire goes to the double relay. Is it connected to the + side of the
coil? Or is the wire just sitting curled up behind the taillight? [The other
wire coming out the front end goes to the backup lights]

PS, buy a Bentley bus manual!

&gt; I just performed the air vane test with the ignition on and the fuel pump
&gt; did not run. So there is the problem. I also disconnected the fuel injector
&gt; signals just for fun and as expected the van only ran a couple of seconds
&gt; and died. Therefore we ca conclude that injectors are not the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Now to test it further I traced the two fuel pump wires to a relay in the
&gt; back of the engine compartment. I found the fuel pump signal and connected a
&gt; solid 12 V from the battery. The pump worked. So it's not the pump that's
&gt; dead. I have disconnected the relay. It's the one that has two 6 pin sockets
&gt; connected to it. Now I need to find out what are the terminal connections
&gt; and test it. Do you have any clue of what they would be? I have not been
&gt; able to find it in my Haynes manual.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody know this info?
&gt;
&gt; Also remember the test that I did on the air sensor. I had found that all
&gt; the impedance values were good. So can it really be anything else that the
&gt; relay? Is there anything mechanical that could cause the sensor to
&gt; malfunction and not be detected electronically.
