I think some PO was halucinating during assembly.  The stock, tri metal
compound 8 MM studs have superior heat expansion charactoristics and involve
the use of case savers.  If the 10 MM studs were a fix for striped 8MM case
savers, convert all to 10MM with case savers.  Either way you choose, or are
forced into, make them all the same on both sides of the engine.  After
market &quot;Super studs&quot; have no stretch and their expansion rate is not in tune
with the rest of the engine.  Good for racing but not for longevity.
