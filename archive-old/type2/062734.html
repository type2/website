&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; i'm writing this as Hurricane Fran bears down on the NC coast. i've
&gt; obviously cancelled a day trip to Wilmington i had been wanting to take.
&gt; seeing as they have evacuated wilmington. the storm should hit the coast in
&gt; about 3 hours or so...then towards raleigh around midnight. last forcast i
&gt; heard was gusts of up to 50mph + 10-12 inches of rain expected. tornado
&gt; warnings all over the place. i get off of work about 12am-1am.
&gt; 
&gt; i can't imagine a class III huricane packing 115mph is gonna be all that
&gt; weak when it heads 2 hours inland. hmm, question is, will Rumba the 74
&gt; Retrowestie get me home without being blown off the road. anyone driven
&gt; a van in a hurricane before and are still around to talk about it? :-)
&gt; maybe they will let us go home early? i don't think a van is what you
&gt; want to drive if you have to drive in a storm like this.....

Don't do it! I've been blind sided by gusts of this speed, and it's 
knocked me half way into the next lane of traffic (fortunately no one 
was there at the time)... when I was going 50. A bit down the road, a 
big gust lifted the right tires off the road. If you do encounter these 
winds... DRIVE SLOW!
