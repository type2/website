Subject: Re: [T2] re: correct carbs for 73 

Hello Guys  I'm going to put in my 2 cents here  the dual stock solexs 
weren't very good to begin with with that dumb idle circuit only on one carb, the 
egr circuit that was hooked to a blower that always froze,  the crosshafts 
wearing out, and the no longer to be found down tubes that were famous for getting 
sucked into the motor, I saw one that had pinched the rings on the piston.  
Webers are a lot better , the aftermarket solexs have their problems mostly with 
that cheap crap linkage that they copied from those junky Kadrons,  The best 
were Dells  they had roller bearings on the crosshafts, re jetting was way too 
easy , right on top just remove the air cleaners which were cleanable K&amp;N .  
If any of you that love the OE solexs let me know I have a shelf of them which 
I will gladly sell   Later and have fun  mark Dearing  salem Import Service  
salem va       PS  I have at this moment 5 vehicles running dual dells, one 
set on a hot rod bug for over 15 years and haven't touched them
