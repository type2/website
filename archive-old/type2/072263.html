yep i see. lugging in this case i think i prolly wanted to use hesitating
or missing. if i had it over i'd say bucking. it was more bucking than
lugging. i guess it was lugging 150 miles ago when it seemed driving the
bus had moments, usually at 40mph, similar to a time someone pulled my belt
loop from behind while i was walking when wearing 501s. within 150 miles it
went from gently bucking, to full on bucking. i even got a backfire in
there today.

the choke not opening up is a function of the ceramic element(?) i have
doubts about mine. i have two of them: one has a rusty ring and a rusty
spiral coil on the inside, the other had caked carbon crud i had to pick
out. (did i say i found this bus in the trash?) either way, i am ashamed to
admit i still don't have the thermostat and all that goes with it
(flappers), and am looking to trade for one when i get my vw weblink up and
whirling.

i took another brief spin this evening but will need more data. i'll run it
tomorrow morning, putting it throught the drills, and see if in fact that
choke/element is a problem. i suspected it before, and went for the
replacement element this morning while refurbishing the 30/31.
NBIGthanks one and all. you've been a great enormous help.
