This morning as I drove my 71 bus, I noticed a new noise, a clunking
sound. I bought this tranny from David Schwarze five years or more
ago when he lived in San Diego. It has performed just fine until now.
The engine is fairly new, and does not make any weird noises with the
clutch in, even at high rpm.

Anyway, am I correct to blame the tranny?   Other clues:
1. clunk appears to correspond to one rotation of the wheel.
2. clunk can be felt anywhere in the bus, especially on the gear shift knob.
3. clunk goes way when coasting (clutch in).
4. clunk is worst when down shifting when the clutch pedal is let up.
5. clunk is also bad when accelerating or going up a hill.

So, the clunk happens under load, downshifting or accelerating.

Possible causes:
1. ring gear?
2. CV joint?

All the CJ joint bolts are tight. I did replace a broken
boot about 6 month ago, and the CV joint was nearly dry.
Maybe its dead.

I plan to drain the tranny to see if any gear teeth come out. If
that is clean, what else could be wrong?
