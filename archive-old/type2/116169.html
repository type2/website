Subject: Electrical + Starter Wiring

Hey guys,

	I'm going to really attempt to get this sucker running this weekend
and I was hoping you guys could help me.
I honestly have NO patience whatsoever to look at charts, diagrams, flow
charts, and wiring schematics. I do this kind of crap every day (except the
wiring schematic part), and the last thing I want to do is read this stuff
out of the manual on my weekends.

If someone could give me a no BS, layman's wiring diagram in text, I'd
appreciate. From what I gather, the alternator has a separate voltage
regulator.

If someone could explain the connections between A) The battery, B) The
Alternator + Voltage Regulator, C) The STARTER, and D) the IGNITION.... I'D
REALLY appreciate it.



Thanks!!!
