Subject: Re: Air Intake Elbow Boot

Hi Sage

On 10/02/03, you wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is off a late bay.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; BTW, what is a &quot;late bay&quot;?
&gt;&gt; 

&gt; Sorry, Wil (who has a 1980 Vanagon)

&gt; I guess I just use that term to distinguish two general categories
&gt; of bay window VWs.

&gt; I don't know if there is a formal year breakout, but in the terms we
&gt; are discussing, the late bay would be the fuel injected models. (Air
&gt; Intake Elbow Boot)

sure....

snip...

&gt; So, whatever the item, there seems to be an early version and a
&gt; later version in the bays.

...but the main theme is refering to the windshield? vs. the split
window?

&gt; If there is no distinction, like the windshield, it would be silly
&gt; to try to distinguish the bay window model, and when the bumper has
&gt; a unique year factored in, like the 1972 rear bumper mounts, then
&gt; you cannot make a distinction between the items as early/late bays.

&gt; Another popular distinction is California or Federal. Of course we
&gt; are neglecting those bays which are not USA models (as we have done
&gt; re: upright and suitcase/pancake engines).

mine seems to be Federal/non-CA...  If I move to California do I have
to sell it?

&gt; I'll try to get the item out to you this weekend.

Thanks.

&gt; I am sending this CC: to the list to generate a few flames...

Ha!!!


Sincerely,
