Im not even going to post the recent mileage difference between my bus and
the Durango.  Lead foot or not.  Let's leave it at this, once the BN4 is in
the bus, we'll be driving it more and more often.  The wife has shown
interest in dumping the Durango for a well kept Vanagon Weekender though ;)

Currently reporting a 20+ mpg average though in town on the fresh rebuild.
So far so good.

&gt; My v6 Explorer gets about the same mileage on the highway as the Guac.
&gt; Low 20's. Around town it does worse, mostly because of the taller
&gt; tires.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, driving habits make a world of difference. There's a guy on
&gt; one of the Explorer boards got over 30mpg with a 2wd Explorer with
&gt; cat-back exhaust replacement and free flowing air filter. I suspect he
&gt; drives like the pedal is stronger than his leg...
