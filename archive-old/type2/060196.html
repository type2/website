Those wires are probably fine.  Sounds like the original wires were the
wrong ones.  You want the ceramic type with the seals around the holes -
well, maybe I shouldn't say that for sure since I don't have a type I, but
for my '73 bus with type IV, those are what you're supposed to have.

&gt;&gt; &gt; wires. After I replaced the plugs and wires, it didn't have as much
power,
&gt;&gt; &gt; would lose speed badly on hills.

That's very strange - I find it very hard to believe that wires alone would
do this.  My guess is that you also changed something else when you
replaced the wires, and that was the source of your problem.  

&gt;So, what would happen if I had hydraulic lifters, and I'd adjusted them to
&gt;.006, because I didn't KNOW they were hydraulics?

It would be a little noisy, but I don't think it would affect your power
that much.  Whatever you do, don't tighten them unless you're SURE you have
hydraulics.

&gt;Set it to where it was happiest by ear, once we got it running, and it did
&gt;end up right around 10.

As long as there is no detonation, this should be okay.

&gt;&gt;             275 isn't extremely hot, and you're never going to see 125-158,
&gt;&gt; more likely 200-225 or 250 normal running.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Really!? Wow, that's good to know! &lt;smile&gt; Uh, can I get a second opinion
&gt;on that? I was under the impression that the oil would start to degrade
&gt;over 230... &gt; 

Here's a second opinion:  Whoever told you that normal was 125-158 was dead
wrong.  &quot;Normal&quot; is a matter of much debate but it is generally accepted
that your oil temperature should be at least 180 in order to lubricate the
engine properly, and temps up to 230 are not extreme.  I have seen 250 on
my bus in very hot conditions with no observed problems, although I start
to get nervous at that temperature.  If you're seeing 275, your engine is
running too hot!  My advice is to do what you have to do (slow down,
downshift, whatever) to keep it under 250.  With respect to Mr. Seaver's
statement, 25 more degrees is probably not going to kill your engine, at
least in the short term, but I would argue that 275 *is* extremely hot, and
I wouldn't ignore it.

&gt;That's a really good idea, but it can be a little harder to do when you
&gt;don't have any help, and you don't know what you're doing. My housemate's
&gt;response to anything I try to do with my bus, is to tell me I should 'just
&gt;get a real car', I can't even ask him to turn the key for me. 

I'd get a new housemate.
