&gt; For years I've heard of these as the conversion engines and someone
described
&gt; them as &quot;boxer&quot; engines the other day. Anyone on the list actually
done or
&gt; seen one of these?

Check with:

They have all sorts of adapters.  The 2.2l Legacy engine sounds neat,
but they don't seem to fit into Bays.  They say that they fit
wasserboxers fine.  This would seem the ideal solution to a
wasserboxer owner who already has a cooling system installed.
