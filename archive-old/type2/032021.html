&gt; &gt;If you don't like the newspapers &amp; tiptoeing through the tripfalls on the

&gt; &gt;wires, very efficient.

Since I'm painting some tin currently I'll mention what I did in this 
regard.  Went down to the hardware store and got one length of small PVC 
pipe and 4 elbows.  Cut the pipe into lengths (I did two 2' and two 3') 
and made a &quot;painting frame&quot; out of it.  I use the screw holes in the 
tin and thin wire to secure the tin to the painting frame, and then paint 
away with my spray can.  Using the frame I can twist and turn and flip 
and flop the tin to the right angle and get good coverage without having 
to contort myself into weird positions.
