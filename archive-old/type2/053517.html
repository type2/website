RMMW sells an &quot;end play tool&quot; for $28.50. I'm wondering if this tool works
adequately? I also saw it in J.C. Whitney- but I can't locate it in the
catalog I'm looking at now. I thought it was much cheaper. Has any one used
this tool? Or would it be cheaper to get a dial gauge?

&gt; &gt;Hello all,
&gt; &gt;    Just got the drive plate off my old block and I'm in the process of
&gt; &gt;putting it on new longblock. The question I have is there some way to
&gt; &gt;measure the end play without a dial gauge?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, there is. You can use any flat metal stock, a bolt, 3 nuts, a few
&gt; washers and a feeler gauge to make an endplay measuring tool.
&gt;
&gt; What you do is attach the flat metal stock to the bolt securely; then
&gt; attach the bolt to one of the engine-to-tranny mounting points; position
&gt; the metal over the flywheel (close but not touching); then measure the &quot;in
&gt; distance&quot; and the &quot;out distance&quot; of the flywheel to the metal bar. Use
&gt; basic math (subtraction) to calculate the difference and you have end
play.
&gt;
&gt; The trick is to get the right size metal stock (length-wise and wide
enough
&gt; for your bolt), make sure it's straight, and make it mountable to the bolt
&gt; you use (e.g., drill a straight hole in the metal bar stock if you have
to).
&gt;
&gt; You're only talking about a few thousanths of an inch when you're looking
&gt; at end play. It's likely not going to be perceptable if you're *looking*
&gt; for movement. You can *feel* the movement of end play, but it's not enough
&gt; to really *see* it. You really should measure it, though. Someone may have
&gt; a drawing of the end play tool. I want to say I think there might be one
in
&gt; Muir...but I might be wrong about that too.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck! Joe
