Subject: Trans Troubles  It is always something!!!!!!  Omaha VW show this Saturday!!!!

This morning drove about 5 miles and the transmission started making 
horrible noise in 4 gear.  Grinding and a whining noise.  Drove home in 
3rd but the noise was still there but not as bad as 4th.  I believe that 
it is time to look at a new transaxle for a 72 Westie.  What do I need 
to think about and who does a good rebuild job or should I just order a 
Trans from someone?  Who is good on rebuilding and who sell the most 
transaxle for the money?  Looking for Listie input.  Clue me in please  
Also our show is this Saturday so here are the particulars   Probably 
will not be in the 72 Westie but please look me up anyway?   Probably 
hanging with NQ at his '67 bus
