Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle history report pre-81

&lt;&lt; My eyes are on a '71 and I have the VIN for it. However it is a pre-1981 
&gt;10-digit VIN for which Carfax does not work. ( Since 1981 VINs are 16digit) 
&gt;&gt;

I'm just curious...What exactly does CarFax report and how does it know...?-(
After a vehicle stops going to the dealer for scheduled maintainence or re-
pairs how would it know what repairs or alterations an owner did either him-
self or at a private garage...Other than accident reports, I can't see how it 
gets its info...
