Subject: type IV oil strainer unit loose in case
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Situation:
The engine is out of the bus, on an engine stand and there is no oil in the 
engine.  I am installing it into a new bus, there is nothing wrong with it.

I removed and cleaned the oil strainer screen tonite.  I reached up into the 
case through the hole and discovered that the cup shaped part with the stud 
in the middle of it is loose! I can wiggle it with my fingers.  This is the 
part (I believe) shown in figure 16-4 on page 56 of the engine and clutch 
section of the bus 1968 through 1979 Bentley.

Before I do something either dumb or silly, is this a common situation and 
you simply take up the looseness when you tighten the bolt that fits through 
the strainer and round sump plate?

If NOT, how do I tighten this part up?  I temporarily put things back 
together (loosely) to avoid further dripping.

any advice will be appeciated!
