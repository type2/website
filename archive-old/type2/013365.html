&gt; I have installed a temp sensor from Gene Berg in my brand new Mexican

&gt; This is driving me nuts because it's nicer and cool outside still. Any
&gt; ideas?

First question:  what does &quot;cool outside&quot; mean (what ambient temps)?

List of things that would contribute to overheating:

potential issues:

1) your timing/point-gap is off
2) you're running your carb too lean
3) valves need to be adjusted

things which are small by themselves but can easily add up:

1) you need to clean off your cooling tin so it can effectively lose 
heat (not a bad idea anyway)
2) you are missing an engine or engine hatch seal
3) your tires aren't inflated properly/bad alignment and the engine is 
working
	harder to move the bus
4) your oil is low and you need to top it up

HTH,
