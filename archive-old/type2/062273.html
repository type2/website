&gt;What is a tappet?
It's a valve lifter.

&gt;What does it look like?
It looks like a steel cylinder.  One end is cupped to accept the end of a
push rod.  The other end is flat and may be of a larger diameter than the
rest of the cylinder.

&gt;Where does it go?
It (along with the other 7 tappets) moves up and down in a machined bore in
the engine case.  The flat end rides a lobe of the camshaft; the cupped end
moves the pushrod.

&gt;What does it do?
As the camshaft revolves, the lifter moves up and down.  This motion is
transmitted through the pushrod and rocker arm to the exhaust or intake
valve, opening and closing it.
