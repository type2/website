Subject: Re: '79 Cal bus - EGR filter?

I read somewhere that The 1979 cal. models had oxygen sensors but not egr
filters and that the Federal models had egr setups but not oxygen sensors.
I have a 79' federal model and I know that I had an egr setup and no o2
sensor.  However I recently had the egr pipe sealed because of the cost of
a replacement filter(over $200).  I am not sure but I think I read this in
the Bently manual.  Possibly under the Fuel injection system section.
