Hmm- starts, runs for FEW MINUTES, quits, won't start again....for how
long??? Long enough to let engine get cold again?  Moving the switch from
start to just ignition relies on the contact in the air sensor to keep pump
running while air flap is open (due to engine vacuum) while engine is
running, so I assume it can't be the fuel pump contact as was suggested.  A
leaky cold start valve could cause problems after engine warms and cause
flooding during restart...the Bentley method is more complicated (pulling
the valve) so the Bosch manual is better- just clamp the fuel supply to the
valve and see if this stops the stalling/poor restarting.  If it does,
you'd have to check the thermo-time switch as well as the valve.
   The other things I'd check are the correct values for the cyl head temp
sensor and the air temp sensor in the air meter.  The 78 should have 7
terminals on the air meter; check ohm value between 6 and 27- this should
be high when cold (I put mine in the freezwer; went up to 6000 ohms.  This
should drop to around 2500 at room temp.  The head sensor wire tip ohm
value to ground should be around 2500 at room temp and I believe lower when
hot (200?)  and higher when really cold.   Check all that out and let us know!
