Subject: windsheild repair

Hi all,

     I took my windshield out to fix the rust &amp; I am out of my league.  The
lip that holds the seal is missing in some places.  So far there are no
holes in the nose.  Does anybody have any experience with a body shop in the
SE Portland area?  Since I do not weld, I need some help.  Maybe even
someone with more body work experience then me to come &amp; take a look at it.
Help.
