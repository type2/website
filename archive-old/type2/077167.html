&gt; Tom, I pmailed this to you last night, never heard back. Maybe you didn't get

&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; I want you to do a couple of things [ok, more than a couple] and send me the
&gt; results:
&gt; 
&gt; What are the numbers stamped in the body of the dizzy?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a timing light with an advance dial or a degree wheel on the crank?
&gt; 
&gt; At idle, do you have vacuum at the inner port of the vacuum unit?
&gt; 
&gt; At idle, disconnect the inner port hose. What is your timing now?
&gt; 
&gt; Leave it off and plug the line. Run engine to 3500. Read timing. What is it?
&gt; Disconnect outer hose.
&gt; Read timing again at 3500. What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Take off the dist cap. Look on the arm of the vacuum unit just before it
&gt; attaches to the breaker plate. There should be a 3 digit number. What is it?

Karl,

After a long weekend, I finally got a chance to sit down and play
with my bus, so I finally have some numbers/results.  However, before
I even got to the testing stage -- that of pulling off vacuum hoses,
etc. -- I threw an old dual-vacuum adv. dizzy that came in a box of
parts included with the bus, in to check out how it performed.  I had
previously not used this dizzy because it was a big question mark and
I had not been able to get it to work previously.  This time I was 
able to get it working (new cap/points might have done the trick) so
I'll include the numbers on that too.

For those just tuning in, last Friday I posted:

&quot;My dual-vacuum advance dizzy has a total advance of ~54 degrees, i.e.
	at idle it's set at 5 deg ATDC and _at_3500 rpm it advances to
	~48-49 deg. BTDC.  This is on a stock 1600DP in a '71 bus&quot;

So:

1) I have a degree pully

2) The numbers on the dizzys are:

rebuilt dizzy i bought (the one with ~54 deg total advance):
   &lt;-  JFVD4
   0 231 181 005
   
   vacuum arm has: 2605 stamped on it

parts box dizzy, possibly original:
    JFUDR 4  &lt;-
    0 231 173 001
    211 905 205Q

    vacuum arm has: 853 stamped on it

Right.  So, when I popped the parts box dizzy in and timed my bus
(5 deg ADTC _at_ 850 rpm) and brought it up to 3500 rpm, lo and behold,
it advanced to ~29 deg BTDC, exhibiting ~34 deg TOTAL advance, which,
according to earlier dissertations on distributors, seems to be
what is expected for a 1600 DP!  A quick run up a couple of big
hills nearby (Mt. Soledad, specifically) showed oil temps ~8-12 deg F
cooler than what I had previously seen.

If I read the facts right, it would seem that I had the wrong dizzy in my 
bus, one with too much total advance.  As necessary, I can pop the
&quot;new/rebuilt dizzy with ~55 deg total adv&quot; back in and check out how
it performs under the other tests you mention, but I'm not sure what
that will tell me.

Thanks for your help!
