ALL rear windows from 64-79 are the same size(regular Bus, not SC or DC).
There may be some strange mutations like an ambulance or oddball special
purpose van, but all standard type 2s with a rear hatch window are the same
size 64-79.

Greetings to the List.............

I was just wondering..........Is the rear window in a 1970 Bus the same size

(basically the same window) as one found in a '78?  I'm not too concerned 
with defroster grids or tints, just measurements.

Thanks All!

Mike
