Several people have protested to me that it is too spelled &quot;karma&quot;, and
some furnished citations, which I did not check because I took to heart the
admonitions that it does not MATTER THAT MUCH HOOPER so okay then. I
apologize for shooting off.

Now, let's see if we can make up for some of that. This is the season when
we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the magic pumpkin to the Feral
Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On Earth and six more weeks of
winter. In the spirit of holiday giving, therefore, we give you the
inestimable work of Chris and Gina. This is the best thing since the
Flannel Bus Underwear (which by the way really is for sale at Target in the
United States, we kid you not). Go here:
