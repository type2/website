Subject: Re: [T2] belly pan, BA6 and painting

My Westy has the heater hiding behind the belly pan. The outside of the 
pan has undercoating on it but the inside does not, nor does the 
underside of the floor. I don't think this has anything to do with the 
heater though. If the heater is running and installed right it should 
not warm up the undercoating enough to worry about as long as you have 
some air flow clearance between the heater and any flammable materials.

&gt;I removed my belly pan for the first time today. Apart from the usual amount
&gt;of rust on the other side and the sandblasting media that just keeps turning
&gt;up I was quite shocked to see how my rust existed.
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking of applying some undercoating but I thought about the BA6 and
&gt;was wondering if it will get too hot for the undercoating.
&gt;
&gt;How have other people painted under the center of the bus with a similar
&gt;configuration?
