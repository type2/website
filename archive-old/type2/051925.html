Subject: [T2] engine removal

I think the Haynes manual shows pictures and explains how to remove the
engine using a rig set up from the access panel on top of the engine. My
Haynes covers the 74 model year but since I'm not home dont know the other
years covered. But my guess is if you have the access panel in your bus go
look at a haynes manual.
