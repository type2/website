&gt; I simply used stick-on velcro fuzz all around the window frame, and 

For the mexico trip I made up some no-see-um screens for the front
windows of my 65 bus. I used magnetic strip and sewed it to the window
shaped pieces of netting all around the edges.Then just set them on the
window frames on the outside.  Worked great, but I only used them while
the bus was stationary.
