Subject: Re: [T2] Dual circuit brake safety?


&gt;As far as I know all VW's (air cooled anyway) dual circuit systems are 
&gt;split front/rear.
&gt;On Bus's with disk brakes (~'71 on I think) there is also a pressure 
&gt;splitter/regulator to vary the pressure front to rear. This may also be 
&gt;linked in with the master cylinder to regulate pressure when one side of 
&gt;the dual brakes fail.
&gt;I'm not sure why you see what you do on the master cylinder on it's own, is 
&gt;something preventing full travel of the master cylinder?

Richard,

No question there is a front and rear system on the bus. My measurements on 
ONE system (73 Datsun) indicate that when one circuit fails the surviving 
circuit loses some (most) of its normal pressure past a seal in the master 
cylinder so don't count on full up pressure in either curcuit in an 
emergency.

Chuck
