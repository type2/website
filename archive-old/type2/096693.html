&lt;&lt; Hi Volks,

Bertha's due for a new exhaust, whats new and breathes nice for a Westie?

(if I ask dumb questions I am VERY new to VW)

Did inherit a 100,000km watch of my uncles from his 50's bug.

Watch has outlasted car by 40 years!
 &gt;&gt;

Once upon a time VW dealers gave badges out every 100,000
kilometers...Now they hand you a new lease form...:-(
