Subject: a couple of things...

I removed the engine from my 79 (78 FI engine) last
night, and in my haste forgot to drain the oil.  I plan
to remove the heads and send them to the machine
shop for rebuilding.  When I remove the heads and pushrod
tubes, will the oil come pouring from the crankcase?

Also, I thought it would be a great time to replace all
my fuel lines and injector seals.  What size line should
I look for and is it commonly available at the FLAPS?

Thanks,

Rob
