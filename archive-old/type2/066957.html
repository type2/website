Ok, so its not Friday anymore.

I'd leave Yosemite, in California (where I live (^:) and drive south to
the Mojave desertt and across Arizon, up to Grand Canyon, thence across the
Navajo Nation towards Four Corners ans Shiprock, south to Route 66 and take it
up through Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.  Take in Dodge City, cross over to
Missouri at KC.  Down through Branson and the Ozarks of Arkansa toward Memphis.
Head south to peek at the strip of gambling joints on the Mississippi border
and then across Tennessee to the Appalachians.  Follow them north through
the Shennendoah.  Stop and see a bunch of Civil War battlefields (those
War-Between-the-States ones, for you southerners) and the Smithsonian. Head
north again through the Pennsylvania Dutch country, drive through NJ and NYC
in the middle of the night, and enjoy Conneticut (Mystic Seaport and the
Nautilus at Groton) and Rhode Island, heading up the coast. See Mass and
New Hampshire coast, up to Maine.  Eat some Lobsters and fried clams, maybe
a &quot;Frappe&quot; and turn back west, through the White Mountains of New Hampshire,
the Greens of Vermont and the Adirondacks of New York.  West across the great
farmlands of New York to Niagra, down through more farmlands of Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinios, Iowa.  Turn north at Nebraska up through
South Dakota to the Badlands and Mount Rushmore.  Hit Devil's Tower in
Wyoming, up to Custer Battlefield in Montana, down through Yellowstone,
wade in the flooded Bonneville Salt flats, across Nevada...

Naw, did that last year.  Did Alaska this summer.  Maybe Eastern Canada, where
I think Quebec is one of the prettiest cities in North America.  I'm
trying to talk the wife into perhaps buying a VW camper in Europe next
summer for a drive through, meeting customs agents from many countries...
