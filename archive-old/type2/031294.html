&gt; I'm flying to NY to pick up a '73 European Panel Bus tomorrow night.
&gt; 
&gt; The plan is to drive it back to St. Louis.
&gt; 
what route do you plan to take?? having driven most of the different ways
let me offer some advantages and disadvantages

I-80/I-71/I-70, 
. probably the shortest route.
. probably the least hilly

. the streach through central to Western PA is the most isolated, not many
gas stations or help
. fewer AIRS members


I-95/I-78/I-70
. maybe the most AIRS members
. lots of service and help along the way

. NJ turnpike
. PA turnpike
. OHIO turnpike
. some pretty stiff grades

I-78/I-81/I-70/I-68/I-70

. pretty level run 
. still civilized country but away from most traffic
. this is the truck route
. avoids the turnpikes
. prettiest route, fall colors will be beautiful

. this is the truck route
. one stiff grade, in MD (Sideling Hill)

I-78/I-81/I-40/I-24

. most level route
. truck route to South West
. pretty route

. longest route
. some parts pretty isolated
. some long steep hills
. weather can get pretty bad in the Mountains


personally I would probably take the I-78/I-81/I-70/I-68/I-70 route
(that detour over I-68 in the middle takes you around the PA turnpike and
a few very stiff grades)


good luck and have a great trip

Bob
