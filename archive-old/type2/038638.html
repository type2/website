Subject: 77 REAR DRUMS

    My 74 does not have the spring things in the middle of the shoes/plates
BUT I recently ordered 2 new backing plates (from Just Kampers) one came
from Germany with the holes drilled and one from Brazil WITHOUT the holes
drilled for the springs. Do I use srpings or not? Does it matter anyway my
74 hasn't got them and seems to stop fine.
