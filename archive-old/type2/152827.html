Subject: Re: [T2] heated clothing

Hm - dual use! I think I may have to look into that - not that I do much
riding in the winter anyways - one of the reasons - ITS TO DARN COLD to be
riding a motorcycle everywhere :)

A cheaper fix for heat may just be a &quot;Mr Heater buddy&quot; just got one for xmas
- and heats up the bus REALLY nicely when driving..

&gt; In my more carefree days, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, in
&gt; addition to driving Type 2s all over, I also chose to ride and tour on a
&gt; H*nda GL1100 Interstate.  Widder was and still is a very popular,
&gt; quality outfit when it comes to heated gloves, vests, jackets, chaps,
&gt; pants,
&gt; socks, etc.  Been using their products for aeons.  Now that I drive a Type
&gt; 2
&gt; with a REAL heater, I don't use them as often tho....

&gt; &gt; I was at the motorcycle show in Toronto Canada this weekend... and came
&gt; &gt; across a company with heated clothing...  http://widderca_dot_com
&gt; &gt; The sales guy said they can sew the heaters into what every you want...
&gt; &gt; seats.. pants... so if you can't find an off the shelf item.. ask them
&gt; &gt; about custom ideas you may have.
&gt; &gt; I am not affiliated with this company at all..
&gt; &gt; I just found it interesting.
