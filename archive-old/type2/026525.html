Subject: RE: Obsessing on Dizzy, 009 timing (how far to set advance)
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8F91_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;with about 44 degrees total advance (not sure exactly since it's off the 
&gt;scale).  I'm sure an 009 cannot supply this much advance unless you set 
&gt;it to something like 15 or more degrees BTDC initial (which is way too
much)

Some very good points, David.  And I think you've hit the nail on the head
when you say the 009 will give you too much advance at low RPM if you set it
for 40 degrees max.  I'll still stand by my statement that you should never
advance an 009 to give you more than 28-32 max advance (OK, I'll go along
with 32 since that's where I ran my 914 2.0 for 3 years).  Otherwise, you're
gonna find yourself with 44 degrees at only 2700 RPM which will kill you.

&gt;but I bet you are losing a bunch of power from lack of advance.

And here, all along, I thought I was losing a bunch of advance from lack of
power!

What you said makes good sense - probably why all the 914 guys are running
050's instead of the 009's.  I think maybe I'll have to try one soon and see
what it'll do.
