Subject:      Front Door Rubber (was Re: Looking for Rr Bumper)

&gt;  Who *does* have correct front door to body seals now (for early
&gt;bus)?

The best door to body seals I have seen are the West Coast Metric
ones.  The profiles are pretty correct, but the color is wrong.
The Wolfsburg West front door to body seals I got a year or two
ago were the correct color, but every piece was the same contour
as the cargo door rubber.  I'll take the correct contour over the
correct color any day.

Can anyone comment on the correct-ness of front door rubber from
RMMW, BusBoys, Vintage Parts, etc.?

Dave
