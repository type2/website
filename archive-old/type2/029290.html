On Wed, 14 Oct 1998, Chematics wrote re. the heater/blower:

&gt; could anyone enlighten me on how this is wired?  In my 74 Westy, the fan
&gt; was there but disconnected and I cannot seem to find any wires that are
&gt; supposed to go there.  There are wires in the engine compartment that were
&gt; disconnected or cut and do not go anywhere (thanks to the PO), and I would
&gt; assume that at least 2 of these would go to the fan.  Any help is
&gt; appreciated.

The blower is connected to a square relay box that is wired to the middle 
heater-lever on the dashboard.  The wire has an in-line fuse - 16 amp I 
think.  When you push this lever all the way down it turns on, providing 
the ignition is on (later buses).

You might be able to pick up the relay from a junk yard, but you could 
easily make your own set up with a minimum on electronics know-how.  I 
personally don't like the lever operation, and am wiring in a toggle switch 
on the dashboard to operate the fan.

Check out the Haynes manual for a good wiring diagram.
