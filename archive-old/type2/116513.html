Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Window Defogger Grid

Well, I'll be curious to hear from you how it actually defrosts, when you
get to the point of being able to test it.  If your's is a success I will be
doing the same thing, although I'm not sure I want to take the window glass
out.  My bus now has good paint and a good seal, so I really don't want to
mess up either of those.  S'OK, I can stand under the open hatch and strain
my neck for a while if I know I can fix it.

Russ,

With my 78, the problem *was* multiple breaks in the grid lines.

They &quot;looked&quot; pretty good until you actually started probing them
with a VOM or looked at them through a magnifing glass.  Multiple
little valleys with no connection.

That is why i ended up doing all of them.

I gently cleaned off all of the oxidation with fine steel wool and then
used masking tape to match(as closely as possible) the lines along the
original.  Easy to then run a paint line down the middle and wait the
20 minutes or so for it to dry.

The only thing i should have done differently is to use the *really* good
paint type masking tape.  Easy to do while sitting on the porch with your
favorite beverage and good conversation(with the window out of
course)&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've been trying to solve this problem for years. I get proper voltage at
&gt; the terminals and busbars at the ends of the window when the switch is on,
&gt; but no current flows (checked w/ ammeter in series w/ grid).  I measure an
&gt; open circuit from busbar to busbar with the power off.  I probed the
&gt; gridlines with a voltmeter to try to find the breaks (meter leads on each
&gt; side of a break would show nearly full voltage - meter leads across good
&gt; grid line would show minimal voltage), but, I must have multiple breaks in
&gt; every gridline.

&gt; Took 2 $20.000 kits.
