Subject: 74 Westy for sale

I'm selling this for a friend...so here goes.
This bus has seen many years of Grateful Dead tour duty so it definitely has 
soul.
It's yellow with a near mint condition blue/green plaid interior, has sink, 
stove, tables, child hammock, bug screen, trash box, etc...
It hasnt been driven for 2 years so it needs some work.
Work needed: Unknown engine repair(doesnt run and I have a motor if needed), 
tires, driver's side rocker and dogleg(rusted), poptop seal,
The body and axle beam are very solid except for what I mentioned.
No dents or bondo. Very worth fixing. It would be easy to get this dog back 
on the road. She's seen so many roads...800.00 obo. Call me or email. 
Thanks, Sam 301-622-0311
