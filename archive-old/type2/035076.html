Subject: Re: $4000 is not enough (was major engine problems)

Gentlepersons-
                       ...Hmmm. Playing the odds, that would make a '71 (last 
year with up-
right engine, but with discs), the best choice for economy since most Bug 
engine re-
lated equipment is readily (!?), available, hence cheaper. A complete 
new/rebuilt en-
gine is often cheaper than the parts and labor for a major repair on an 
upright. Carbs
are cheaper/easier to work on than FI. An alternator conversion will supply a 
decent
stereo and a larger battery (go head splurge- get an Optima). OK, it's slower 
than the
'72-'79...Leave earlier.
