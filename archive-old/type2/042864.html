Subject: Overheating type IV after new head, Italy trip on FRiday!!

Hi,

I am planning to travel down to Italy over the Alps departing on Friday, and
am very concerned that my engine will seriously overheat on the mountain
passes.

I have a 1979 2litre with twin carbs. (CJ engine)

I replaced the left hand head with a complete new head a couple of weeks ago
(dropped valve seat No3 exhaust).

Since then the engine has been running hot.  You don't notice this on short
trips, but on long trips on the motorway doing a steady 55mph the engine is
about 10oC hotter.  This isn't too bad as the weather is slightly warmer but
as you hit stand still traffic or town the oil temp soars to a height I have
never seen before.

I have checked all the tinware, fans, valve clearances, plugs, ignition
timing etc and it is all spot on, also the fuel economy is best it has been.

Could the new head be the wrong type?  Someone told me that because my 79
Heat exchangers fitted it must be the correct head.

Could it be a clogged oil passageway?

Maybee I intrefeered with the cooling tinware somewhere?

If I can't get to the bottom of the problem I am looking for advice or extra
things I can do to keep the engine cool?

Leave the auxillary fan runnung and disconnect the hot air tube under the
cab?

Block the 2 passageways that let air flow from the main fan to the heat
exchangers. So that all the coolong air goes to the engine?


I would be most gratefull for any help as the whole familly is deperate to
go on this trip?

Thankyou in advance for any help.
