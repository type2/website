Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] Weber Progressive Tuning]

the proper timing for our SVDA is 7.5 BTDC at idle, which DOES result in
full advance of between 42-45 degrees, THIS IS NORMAL. Many people aren't
aware that the proper timing needs of the engine are VERY throttle
dependent, and light throttle timing is much more advanced than full
throttle. This is why the 009 has to be timed at a &quot;worst case&quot; setting, and
also why it's such a horrible performer at anything other than idle or WOT.
