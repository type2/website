Hi,

&gt; First off, the bus I'm going to look at is a 1968 -- that's a Type 2,
&gt; correct? 

 They are all type-2s, technically, but yes: the list called &quot;type2&quot;
is focussed on '68-79 busses.

&gt; It has a raised roof -- not a popup, but a permanently raised roof.
&gt; Is this classified as a camper? 

 Yes, but camper also covers poptops and hardtops: It's usually referred
to as a &quot;highroof&quot; or &quot;turtletop&quot;.

&gt; And if so, are there any problems specific
&gt; to that model that I should look for? 

 It's slower than the others (bigger frontal area) and more subsceptible
to crosswinds. Hightops have become more popular as power and suspension
have improved (most of the T4 campers I see are hightops), but that's
about all. It won't fit into a multistorey carpark/garage.

 Hightops are nicer to camp in but not so good to drive. Depends on
your priorities.

&gt; I looked through photo galleries on
&gt; more than a couple different web sites, and didn't see any others that
&gt; looked like this one, which led me to wonder if this was a factory
option,
&gt; or some aftermarket conversion.

 They are all aftermarket (though some are more aftermarket than others
:-).
 VW didn't do the conversions but had  a close relationship with some of
the converters, in particular Westfalia and a couple of the British
converters. I don't know whether the hightop you have will be from an
approved converter or not, but it probably doesn't really matter now.


&gt; I know that it doesn't run, although I have no idea what the problem
is
&gt; until I go look at it. If it's very simple, I'll fix the existing
engine,
&gt; although if it's a very complicated fix,  I'm thinking that I might
try to
&gt; pull the existing engine and replace it with one from a wrecked '83
Rabbit
&gt; diesel with a good drivetrain. Does anyone know if this is possible
-- am I
&gt; insane to consider it? I'm a pretty fair shadetree mechanic; however,
my
&gt; expertise is primarily in Land Rovers. I've never considered tackling
a VW
&gt; before.

 It's possible but IMHO it would be much more difficult than fixing 
virtually anything that could be wrong with your existing engine.
 To warrant doing it you would have to be gaining a lot (better power,
better longevity and better economy) The diesel might cost a little
less to run but the difference won't be huge with your gas prices
being so low, it might last a little longer but I don't think that's
a given and it won't be much more powerful.

Hope this is useful.

Cheers,
	W.
