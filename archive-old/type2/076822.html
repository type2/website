Subject: Re: [T2] crank holder

Hey! That is the ticket! ,, and it worked great!

A local group of folks got together last night to disassemble a T4 2 Liter ,,In
a party type or atmosphere,, beer and wings to start, then some serious
diagnostics, and questions,,  I was able to impress them with a few tips and
tricks I have learned,, and visa versa.
It was quite a learning experience for some folks,, 

I am really impressed with idea's that are &quot;cheap and easy!&quot; :-)

Thanks Kayaker!

&gt; I use the engine stand. I f you have a stand just bolt the crank to one of the arms where you normaaly bolt the case.  Rotates and allows easy access to all journals.
