&gt; No, it's on the FRONT rim of pulley (front as in toward the front of the

&gt; Just like the oil seal at the flywheel end of the engine is the FRONT
&gt; main oil seal and the oil seal at the fan end of the engine (Type 4) is
&gt; the REAR main oil seal, pretty much opposite of those folks with
&gt; front-engined cars :-)

   Uhuh -- nope, sorry, look in Bentleys or any parts catalog. The
*Rear* main oil seal is under the flywheel. The *front* main oil seal is
under the pulley. I know it doesn't make sense, but that's the way VW
calls the shots.
