Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal =&gt; Excessive Travel

Dear Barry,

Your tale of woe is familiar. I had terrible trouble with my 73 when I 
decided to renew the brake shoes at the rear. Basically, the problem 
came down to getting the correct shoe. VW seem to have used at lease 4 
different designs between 72 and 75. My particular vehicle has the 
rarest type which were only fitted for 6 months. Whenever I look in a 
manual the photographs bear no resemblance to my setup.
Anyway, problems were solved eventually by buying the correct shoes, 
chosen by getting my supplier to show me what I was buying, and 
comparing it with what was there originally. Buying by year was wrong, 
and buying by chassis number was even worse. After much head scratching 
and three sets of shoes, all was well. Whenever I had the wrong shoes 
(and the differences were in the activating mechanism - they were all 
the same friction surfaces and diameters), I had exactly your problems.

Probably completely wrong, but maybe this will help.#
