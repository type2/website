Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS help needed Bus Down!

Hey guys me and the bus are home, however we came on a trailer....:0(

We got some M8 bolts about a 1/2 inch long from a fastener place, however 
the flex plate was mangled and bent and the last bolt wouldn't go in. We 
chopped down a longer bolt and got it to thread and it cleared, so I drove 
it up and down the highway and it seemed ok. I left and about 6 miles later 
I heard a pop and the torque converter rattling again. Looks like an engine 
drop and I NEED A FLEX PLATE at the least. I haven't looked into further 
damage yet as I just got home.

Michael-my cell phone died since I haven't been home in two days. Thanks for 
all the help.

Rob Henley
