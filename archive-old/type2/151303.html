Subject: Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

Hoover said his late-90's experiments cost him about $1,600 up to the point 
of running an experimental engine on a test block. He didn't list what the 
$1,600 covered, but I'll guess that it was just the items that converted an 
existing type 4 (2180) to run on propane (LPG).....not the basic cost of 
the engine. He wanted to eventually build up a 1776 after experimenting 
with the 2180.
He mentioned that the owner of Boston Engines had some experience with 
propane powered VW engines in vehicles that were used to smooth the ice in 
big skating rinks, and that they ran at higher operating temps than 
gasoline powered counterparts.

Hoover said he would be looking for his parts mostly from sellers that 
supplied the fork lift community. Impco CA125-76-2 carb at $122.80 (which 
becomes the FB-125 when fitted with a 'feed-back' type diaphragm.)  The 
diaphragm's part-number is AVI-1447-2. ....  and the model J regulator at 
$73.79. Manchester propane tanks were also mentioned. He envisioned putting 
the engine into Grendel  and running her over the 10,000+ foot passes in 
Colorado and through the deserts of Death Valley. IMHO he was an incredible 
visionary that acted on his dreams.

He also mentioned that the CDI module already in use is suitable for an 
LNG-powered engine, but the stock VW ignition system does not provide 
sufficient energy for reliable ignition with gaseous fuel. He said the 
digital fuel controller needs a signal from an oxygen sensor, and that he 
used a Bosch p/n 13913, a three-wire sensor purchased at the 
FLAPS.  Earlier experiments with a single-wire type apparently indicated 
the VW exhaust system runs too cool for adequate response.  The Bosch unit 
uses a 12v heater element and responds immediately.

So, the envisioned combustion-control system consisted of an oxygen sensor, 
a dedicated
digital controller and a vacuum solenoid valve attached to the propane 
regulator.

He eventually mentioned (after some testing) that the Impco CA125-76-2 carb 
proved to be too much carburetor for the task.

In December of 1997 he was very frustrated and discouraged by the many 
roadblocks he encountered in trying to obtain parts and information from 
suppliers. Either they would not talk to him, or they only sold to 
distributors, or the parts were only available in big lots or through 
dealers. And then there were problems with the clean air act that seemed 
very treacherous to even look into.

Hoover spent years on his project and came away very frustrated, but he 
eventually did build and run a propane powered type 4 air-cooled engine.  I 
imagine the next guy that tries it will encounter a whole new and more 
difficult set of roadblocks.

Somewhere in my review of the Hoover letters I did notice mention of how 
much easier it would be to convert and install a water cooled engine in a 
bus and run it on propane. That might be a path for some to follow. The 
other thread was that it probably made more sense to go in the direction of 
diesel and specifically the TDI, to better power our buses. I think a big 
part of that was based on the difficulty of finding adequate space for the 
LPG tanks on a bus.

Better stop here.
