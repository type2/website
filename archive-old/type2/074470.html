Subject: Re: [T2] block heater

Michael:
I agree that a crankcase heater is good for cold starts. Really saves on the
wear in a cold engine, no doubt.
BUT, the main part of the viscosity equation is the AMBIENT (outdoor
environnment) TEMPERATURE.
So, drop down to 20w as the owners' manual says, or probably damned near any
synthetic. The 5w-50's are certainly tempting.
I've been well served by straight weight dino oil 40w in the summer, 20w in the
winter in all my gasoline powered vanagons.
Multi- vis, even 20w-50 will NOT keep the buzzer off on the late 2.1 waterboxers
when hot, and I don't think it does any better or even as good on the 2 liter
air cooleds.
Straight weight Shell for me.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; Hey with all of this talk about using different oil in the winter time I was
&gt; wondering if it might be worth it to install a block heater.  They have one
&gt; for a type 2 (71-79) at www.cip1_dot_com for $24.23.  It sounds pretty good to
&gt; me but I was wondering if anybody has had any experiences with this kind of
&gt; setup and if you would recommend it.  Cause with the block heater couldn't
&gt; you use the same oil all year round and then have the optimum viscosity
&gt; level for both start up AND also when the engine has warmed up.
