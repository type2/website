Hey Scott,
    Same thing happened to me here in Paducah, KY.  Van was sitting in the
backyard off the alley that ran behind the house.  Could not be seen from
the street or any of my neighbors because of a fence.  The only people that
could see it were the garbage men when they came down the alley to pick up
the trash.  One of our neighbors (the same old lady that turned other
neighbors in for not raking their leaves and having them blow to her yard!)
called the city and I got one of those dreaded yellow tags on the back
window.  Like your Bus, you could not see that my Bus was not operational
&gt;from looking at it.  Of course, if you raised the engine hatch, there was a
big hole where the engine goes!  Taxes were current and it was tagged.  To
make a long story short, I had a short, very personal discussion with the
mayor, and moved the Bus.  It was just to big a deal to the city to fight
over.  They WERE going to tow it, no matter what I said or did, so I gave in
and hauled it to the body shop a little sooner than I wanted.
    I guess the point is is that some cities have little Nazi's for mayors
and alderman.  Paid taxes be damned, if they don't like it, or receive a
complaint about a &quot;wrecking yard&quot; in someone's yard, it will be taken care
of, regardless.  Luckily, I live in the &quot;country&quot; now and can have 1,000,000
wrecks sitting around and nobody can do anything about it.  Well, maybe my
wife, but that is another post!
    Good luck in your fight with city hall.  Not to disappoint you or
discourage you, rest assured, you will lose and have to follow their
dictates.  Doesn't make  any sense to me, but that is just the way it is.
Take care
Brian Hayes

Subject: City Gives My Bus the BOOT!


&gt;I got a letter in the mail to day from my city watchdogs and it seems
&gt;that I am in violation of not one but three city sections by parking my
&gt;truck in the driveway.  I guess the clincher was the non-op German NSU
&gt;parked along side it and under a tarp.  I have 10 days to get them out
&gt;of the driveway or &quot;face further legal action&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;From what I gather, some neighbor complained about me and my next door
&gt;neighbor.  They claimed that next door was running an auto repair
&gt;business and I was storing vehicles for him.  The inspector showed up
&gt;and happened to run into my neighbor and he headed her off with respect
&gt;to his property (she's also the street sweeper ticketer and said she
&gt;goes by all the time and doesn't see any auto repair business going
&gt;on).  So the neighbor escapes and I get zapped.
&gt;
&gt;I have room on the side of my house  to move the NSU (its really small),
&gt;but  I have to tear down a new fence that I just put up two months ago
&gt;in order to get it back there.  I'm going to have to fight them on the
&gt;Double Cab.  Its currently registered, just waiting for parts from all
&gt;over the place to put back together.
&gt;
&gt;I think the whole thing stems from my neighbor's son who finds a bus
&gt;about once every other month, gets a few parts off it and then resells
&gt;it to someone else.  His buddies have been tearing up the neighborhood
&gt;with their tires as they come and go and someone got tired of it.
&gt;Teenagers! (yep, I was one once).
&gt;
&gt;I'm just pissed that I'm the one that got the violation notice.
&gt;
&gt;I guess its going to be a busy weekend not to mention that I'm going to
&gt;have to hurry up on that Type IV conversion I'm working on.
