Subject: Buses Of the Corn 2004 Update

Hi Volks,

Only five weeks to go until Buses Of The Corn 2004!

In case you haven't heard, BOTC 2004 is being held August 6th to 8th in 
Whitby Ontario Canada.

WEBSITE:
The news for this week is that http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com  is now 
back online and has been updated with a new page featuring pictures 
from 2003's extremely popular Tie Dye Workshop.

http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/TieDyeWorkshop.html


TIE DYE!
The Tie-Dye Workshop is the perfect opportunity to make your own 
souvenir, or to create your own personal work of art based on the 
official BOTC shirt.


THE SHIRT!
The official shirt is only $10 for those attending BOTC, and is 
available for $15 by mail-order. Did I mention that we're talking 
Canadian Funds? For more information, visit this link:
http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/T-shirts.html

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!

DRIVING TOUR
Another event has been added to our schedule.... AJ Welsh has 
volunteered to set up a driving tour of the area based on the popular 
Poker Run that he holds as part of the European Interest Car Show.  
More info on this soon... Visit www.europeaninterest_dot_com for more info 
on AJ's event.

SWAP MEET:
Since the &quot;Great Canadian Bug Show&quot; is taking a year off this time 
around, we are bringing the swap meet to BOTC. We'll start the swap 
meet right after the Burrito Breakfast on Saturday. Swap space is free 
to all registered campers at BOTC, but bring your own table. I 
mentioned this to some of the vendors at the recent June Jitterbug in 
Niagara Falls and got a good response so I expect we'll have some great 
type2 parts coming to this year's event.


Please forward this info to the other bus lists. THANKS!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
