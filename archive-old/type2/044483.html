Thanks to all who replied. I now have some other options. It seems fuel
injection and Electronic ignition will be some of the first upgrades.

I have another query though:  I read this in the archives:

snip&gt;
You can convert the stock 2.0-liter '77 Type IV engine to hydraulic
lifters (no more valve adjustments) fairly easily. When rebuilding the
stock '77 engine, replace the cam, lifters and pushrods with the '78-'83
hydraulic versions of these. Voila! Instant hydraulic-liftered Type IV
2.0-liter engine.
Unsnip&gt;

Can this be done to my 1700 motor?

Rob

Sorry for the stupid questions

I have run twin weber 34 ICT carbs and also twin weber 40 IDF's on my bus.
They work OK, for carbs that is.  I am getting rid of my current 40 IDF's in
favor of a conversion to Bosch CIS fuel injection as my long term solution
to
achieving the perfect bus.

Miller Fuel Injection, http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com/, sells a conversion kit for
just a bit more than the carb kits.  It is based on late 1970's rabbit/jetta
FI components and the kit has everything you need.  The parts are all
readily
available and have been in VW's and Volvo's since the 70's.  Lots of good
stuff out their in salvage yards. : )  Muir Production's Idiot's guide to
Rabbit/Jetta convinced me that it is a superior and easier to maintain
system
than my carbs.

I have had both a 74 bus with weber carbs and an 87 VW Fox with the CIS in
it
for about 7 years now.  The weber carbs or their linkage have needed
constant
attention.  I have not had to do ONE thing to the FI in the Fox.  I am
anxiously looking forward to this same level of dependability in my bus.
