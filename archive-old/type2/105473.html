Subject: windshield seal

Hi:

Its time for me to replace the windshield seal on my 79 bus. The old 
seal has a chrome strip &quot;embedded&quot; in it. The chrome strip is in pretty 
rough shape, but I suppose I'd like to reinstall it if I can. Is it 
generally the practice to reinstall the strip, or do most people 
dispense with it.

Also, does anyone know of a source for good quality seals that will 
accept the strip? Any special advice relating to installation of the 
seal with the chrome strip in it?

Thanks.

Rob Mead
