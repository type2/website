I'm very certain that the FI being too lean is not the problem.  I've 
checked it several times with the O2 sensor (at idle) and the engine has 
absolutely never run hot.  I've used the &quot;dipstick&quot; test after long 
freeway runs (though the car is basically an &quot;around town&quot; car) and the 
dipstick hasn't even been warm to the touch, let alone hot.

&gt; troubling would be that the FI is too lean, which would damage your
