John,

Thank you for the reply. The article helped me a lot. There is one section
that confuses me a bit.

&gt; TYPE 3 and 4 VEHICLES
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the need for manifold heat, I do not recommend centermounts for the
&gt; type 3 or 4 engine, since the kits available for these engines do not have
&gt; provisions for manifold heat. For the type 3 or 4 engine, I recommend dual
&gt; carbs (more info to follow).

The title line says Type 3 and 4 vehicles. I know that Type 3 vehicles would
be Fastbacks, Squarebacks, etc. I don't know what Type 4 vehicles might be.
In the body of the article it refers to Type 3 and 4 engines. OK, I know
what a Type 4 engines is. That's what's in my bus. I've don't know what a
Type 3 engine is.

I'm new to the VW world so I beg your patience with my ignorance.
