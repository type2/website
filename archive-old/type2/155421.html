Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

&lt;&lt; I find they gouge you horribly. They have little to no interest in
bargaining looking for that one sucker who will pay $120 for a used
clock or other very used part they don't care about.&gt;&gt;

Your right Richard---

However, the ame of the game at any swap meet, thesamba, or even E-Bomb
is to act stupid, and chop them up on their price.

This makes buying fun--especially at the end of the day at the swap
meet--they don;t ant tobe dragging them high dollar items home--wave
sonme green in front of their noses, and the guy who doesn't really care
will grab the dollars outa your hand faster than a speeding bullet.

I love a good dealing contest.--: )

And it can also be done on the internet just as it can be done in
person.
It's the gift of gab, and a bunch of BS.

Adios,
