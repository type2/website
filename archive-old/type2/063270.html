Subject: Split:Windshield Rubber Comparison

Splitters:

A week ago I started my quasi-scientific consumer reTorts effort
to provide some comparison on windshield seals for a split-window
bus.  I placed four orders within 30 minutes on Friday afternoon.
All vendors gave me a variation of &quot;in the mail on Monday&quot; theme.
Well, it's Friday again.  I have received three packages; one
Thursday afternoon, and two this afternoon.  All came UPS.  Still
waiting for delivery from the 4th.

Before I get into comparisons by name, I can provide this much.
Two came in boxes, one in an envelope.  Some interesting data
here, though:

        Vendor 1    Vendor 2      Vendor 3
Parts     24.00       25.90         26.00
S/H       10.00        5.95          4.00
Total     34.00       31.85         30.00

So...apparently the lower prices may end up costing you more
because the shipping costs are higher.  All windshield seals came
&quot;bundled&quot; which is fairly standard practice.  One set came loose
in a box.  One set came with rubber bands around them.  One set
came in plastic bags (one each).  I have done little more than
&quot;feel&quot; the rubber and unfold the rubber for general observation.
Once the 4th package arrives I will provide some more information
on seams, fit, moulding, etc.

I did get a thorough description/suggestion of testing the
elasticity of rubber after subjecting it to 2 weeks in an
autoclave (essentially a pressure cooker) which would simulate 40
years of aging.  I appreciate the idea.  I already have a good
idea of how 40-year-old rubber appears thank you, but will
forward the post to anyone who has an autoclave handy and a
willingness to put $30 in a shredder.

On second thought, I might get by with cutting a sample from an
inconspicuous &quot;inside&quot; location and do some boiling.  Maybe I
could get someone in the Biology Department at my place of
employment to place small pieces in an autoclave for a while.
Let's see 14/40 ~ 1/x, x = (40*1)/14 = 2.857142857142, so one day
in an autoclave = 2.857142 years of aging.

Also received some insight into the effects of bombardment by
radioactivity.  I think I'll pass on the glow-in-the-dark split
window bus, but who knows, it might just be the latest sano-rad
scene on the left coast.  AND!  At the top of the Top Ten Bus
Abuses a while back was a split used as a septic tank.  Maybe
subterranian split window buses as fallout shelters will make a
comeback.  I, of course, would prefer the Westfalia version.
More like an underground home.  Let's see Ziebart guarantee
against rust-through on that baby!

Will keep you posted.  Hope I've provided something to chew on in
the mean time.
