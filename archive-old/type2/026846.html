RE:Brakes pulling to the right.

don't overlook the possibility of restricted hoses [left side if pulling 
while braking, right if pulling after pedal released and brake smell 
present] especially if you disconnect them at wheel and fluid does not 
readily drain. if that's the problem, they probably all want replacement.
i learned a lot about 'power brakes' perusing the archives.
