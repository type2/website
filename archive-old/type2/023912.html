A question about stoves/cookers  (it's purely academic at present)

It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to fit one of those Coleman
(unleaded) petrol fired camping stoves into a 'bus.    
Is this safe ?  Is it a good idea ?  Has anyone tried it ?  

Yes, I know this subject is covered in the archives, but I'm confused by
some transatlantic language problems...specifically when the term 'Gas' is
used does it mean 'Petrol (UK)/Gasoline (US)' or Butane perhaps, or Propane
or something else like LPG or Methane or whatever...
