Subject: I'm afraid, very afraid (fwd)

 A little over a week ago I received a long block for my '81 Vanagon
 from GEX.  Just tonight I read through the archives and saw LOTS of
 negative comments about GEX engines, and now I'm VERY nervous.

 What can I do during the build up and reinstallation of the engine to
 protect myself if I got a lemon?  I'm doing the work myself, reading
 the Clymer manual carefully, and also reading the Bentley manual.

 I've pulled the engine on the van twice, once to redo the clutch,
 once to redo the heads, so I'm fairly confident I know how to remove
 and re-install the engine properly, but what constitutes &quot;proper&quot;
 installation from the standpoint of the GEX warranty?

 I got the engine with the flywheel included (extra $$$$) so measuring
 endplay should not be anything I should have to do.  Beyond using a
 torque wrench on all nuts and bolts which require it, cleaning every-
 thing before it goes back on, setting the timing properly, what else
 can I do?

 (If I'd read the archives _before_ I ordered the engine, I don't
 think I would have ordered from GEX.)

 TIA.
