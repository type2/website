Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

&gt;The term &quot;Deadhead&quot; has been used by cross-country truckers since the
&gt;1930s to denote driving their rigs from one point to another with no cargo
&gt;to pay the way.  A &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker in modern etymological parlance

[yada yada yada]

I thought a deadhead sticker was a &quot;Grateful Dead Productions&quot; sticker, a
means society uses to spot the &quot;hemp-challenged&quot; among us...
