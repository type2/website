Hello everyone!

Well, plans are currently underway for the 3rd annual Josh Rogers Memorial
Campout. It will be held once again at Turner Falls Campground in Davis,
Oklahoma. The dates this year are 21-23 Sept, 01 and we are going to move it
back to the upper campgrounds due to lack of space because of the number
people who showed last year.

I don't have the price per night yet, but it should be the same as last
year. We doubled the number of folks who showed up from the previous year
and I hope that we will grow that much this year. There are some electric
sites very close to the area that are first come, first served.

I will be going down there within the next two weeks to reserve the spot, so
look for more on this then!!
