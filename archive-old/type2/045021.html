Subject: [T2] Westalia covers

Hello Listers:

I noticed that The Bus Depot lists a cover for 68-79 campers.  Does anyone 
have experience with this or similar covers?

I want to protect my '76 Campmobile from the elements and have no room in 
the garage due to the daily drivers.

Thanks for your input.
