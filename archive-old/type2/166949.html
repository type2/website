Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Campout at the Rockies | Plans have changed

Ok, plans have changed for the last time.... seriously :)  I hit the  
send button a little quick on the last message and later realized  
that Golden Gate Canyon State Park was the primary area we were  
shooting for.  Chris (bustedbus) went and checked it out today and it  
looks like the place to be.  They have fire pits, electrical if  
needed, and other items.  Check http://calivw78_dot_com/wordpress/buses- 
by-the-rockies/ for more info.

Peace, Troy
