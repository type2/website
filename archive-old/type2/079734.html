Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank/fuel sender clues

Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am pulling my engine and gas tank tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; 78 t2 std trans
&gt; 
&gt; Does the fuel sender hole face the front or rear of the vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; If the tank is &quot;square&quot; does the sender come out of the top?
&gt; 
&gt; The point is, if it faces the rear or top, can I get it out with the fuel
&gt; tank still in the car and feel around inside the tank before I have to
&gt; take the whole thing out?...yes, I am lazy...if I can feel around inside
&gt; the tank without having to pull it, then maybe I can figure out what is
&gt; covering the hole to the fuel pump and just take it out.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, if such a thing is possible, and I feel all sort of
&gt; gunk in there, then I won't mind pulling it all anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I just have visions of pulling everything only to find a pristine looking
&gt; tank with a piece of saran wrap or something similar floating around in
&gt; it.....probably not a chance in hell, but I gotta ask.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
