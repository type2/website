Hi Volks,

&gt; ... I've struck a bit of a problem finding correct info for the
&gt; timing... I've
&gt; come up with somewhere between 7.5BTDC and 5ATDC for my 2 litre MANUAL
&gt; trans motor(CJ). From what I can work out most of the 76 2 litre engines in
&gt; the US were auto trans(7.5 BTDC) but here in Australia there were also
&gt; manuals , which some info suggests should be 5ATDC. I have never worked on
&gt; anything over 1600 previously so any help would be much appreciated.

 I think the issue is with the induction system rather than the transmission, though that probably confuses things even further.
 The US models after '73 were fitted with Fuel Injection. Despite what you read on the list this appears to have been done only for the US (or North American? No, maybe just US &amp; Canada) market(s). Everywhere else got carburettors (corrections welcomed, if required).

 I also have a CJ series engine- with the stock Solex PDSIT carburetion and distributor it should be timed at 7.5BTDC. Vacuum hoses off. This assumes &gt;=91RON petrol at sea level.

 Mine has a lable to that effect on the fanhousing and a dot at the appropriate point on the timing scale.

 That's the stock setting. Now, given that I'm using leaded petrol (at least for the next 18 months :-(  ) which is rated at 97RON and that I'm getting a hint of hesitation under acceleration (esp. when cold), should I try advancing the setting a few degrees? How do I tell if I've overadvanced it? Listen for pinking?

Cheers,
          W.
