Subject: Gas Smell in Oil on FI Engine
X-Sender-Ip: 146.18.173.200
Organization: E-Mail _at_ The Globe  (http://www.globe-mail_dot_com:80)

I bought a 2.0 liter FI engine last weekend. It's been out of a bus in the back of someone's truck for a while, but it was running when removed. The oil has a gas smell to it, which usually indicates a bad carb adjustment or leaky intake boots to me.

This puppy has some of the worst exhaust that I've ever seen, but I can't see how that would correlate with the gas smell.

Any ideas? I've never run this engine, but it's supposed to be a strong runner. Just want to get the right things checked before I install exhaust and put the engine in the bus.

A big part of my problem is that I'm an idiot when it comes to type 4 and FI engines.

Thanks! Joe
