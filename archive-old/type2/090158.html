&gt; The reinforced tire meets specs. A LR 'C' tire is probably adequate.

The key word here is &quot;probably&quot;.  It depends upon the tire size.  To be
sure, look at the &quot;Max Load&quot; rating on the sidewall.  If it's more than
that specified for your bus (generally 1540 pounds) you're good.

&gt; A
&gt; LR 'D' tire is definitely better.
&gt; LR 'C' = 6 ply rating. LR 'D' = 8 ply rating. I've run all three and the
&gt; LR 'D' tire is a *truck* tire. Was the best of the bunch.

I agree.

&gt; However, with
&gt; that said, if money is an object (as it is with me), a LR 'C' or
&gt; Reinforced tire works much better than a passenger car tire. The LR 'D'
&gt; tire just wasn't worth the doubled price TO ME.

Doubled?  Wow!  Last time I bought tires the difference between C and D
was $7 a tire for Bridgestones.

&gt; (I Currently have
&gt; Kirkland LT195/75-14 LR C tires on the Riviera and Uniroyal Larado
&gt; LT195/75-14 LR C (1435# _at_ 50psi) tires on the Vanagon. The Vanagon is
&gt; due and I'll probably buy the Contis for it.)

I tried the Laredos (before I realized that they were not strong enough)
and got really strange tread wear patterns on the front tires on my '71.
Replaced them with Bridgestones and they wear fine.  I kept the half-run-out
Laredos for use with tire chains as they are smaller in diameter and
narrower than the 185R14 Bridgestones.
