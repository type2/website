Subject: rattley, buzzy shift linkage

Hi All,


I am hoping that someone in VW land has a sure fire fix for the racket that
my 73 Westy's shift linkage makes at around 3500 rpm.

I have replaced the bushings/shifter and the linkage seems to be adjusted
correctly, yet 90% or the time I get this growling/rattling noise from
underneath.  In looking I found that there are two dust boots inline with
the shift rod, both are shot (I'm suspecting that there needs to be grease
in the shift tube and that these little gems kept it in and the dirt out at
one time).

Any sage advice would be greatly appreciated.

Rattling along,
Brian
