Ain,

I am happy to give advice, and will not condemn what I think you are
trying to do, but are you sure you would not be happier with a '76-'79
breadloaf?

The splits were never intended to do interstate speeds.  These days they
are totally impractical &quot;daily drivers&quot; in pretty nearly every environment
I can think of.  On the interstates, they are too slow.  In town they are
too easily damaged.  If I owned your bus, I would use it as the &quot;antique&quot;
it truly is and only drive it to local shows to knock the socks off other
VWer's.

But......

to get a &quot;modern&quot; drive train, one capable of keeping up with current
traffic, you should replace the following.

Front:  get a '73-'79 beam w/disks and power assist and swap it in.
(previously mentioned caveats about me not being a split-type person
apply)

Rear:  install a 1600 DP engine built out to 1778cc, an IRS tranny from a
'68-71 bus, and a &quot;straight axle&quot; kit to eliminate the reduction boxes.
If you try to push the reduction boxes past 65 on a regular basis, you
will chew them up real good and real fast.

All of these are bolt-in mods.  I don't know if the straight axle kit is
still made, but one can probably be found.  The problem is that these mods
will probably set you back more than 2 grand.  You can buy a decent 'loaf
for 1 grand and put the other into making the '59 body *shine*.  Thus you
have an OK daily driver and something to cause other owners to turn green
for the same price as making your '59 into a road-worthy beast.  All this
IMHO, of course.

If you decide to go through with the upgrades, I will be happy to help as
best I can with advice, but I do ask you to pause before you dive in.
