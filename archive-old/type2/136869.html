Subject: Re: [T2] How many different A/C units were available for the
  type 2?

I had 1 overhead ('72 type IV), 1 under dash ('78 Type IV), 1 behind the drivers seat ('73 Type IV) and 1 underdash in a '70. None worked but all needed slight tweaks, new lines, new gas. The '72 went away quickly. The '78 I still have and plan to revived the a/c. The '70 hardly ever moved under it's own power while it was at my house. The '73 was enroute the crusher but it stayed at my house for a while donating parts to me and friends.
