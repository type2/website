Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

&gt; Hello list, my '82 2.0 liter AC Vanagon w/ megasquirt went kaput last

&gt; suspect a valve seat let loose or even a broken valve from the noise
&gt; made while it ran for the minute or so in this condition.  It was
&gt;
&gt; Question:  Is it OK to rebuild by replacing one piston and cylinder
&gt; only?  If so, does anyone have one or where can I buy just one?

the answer is a qualified &quot;Maybe!&quot;  I have done it and the engine ran fine
for years, but officially it is an absolute no-no.  once when desperate I
pulled one cyl and piston without even taking the engine out of the 78
bus.  was a pain and was probably dumb luck that I found one that was
close to balanced.  you can probably find a decent piston and cyl (get
match piston and cyl from same cyl)from an engine that blew one cyl itself
and has 3 servicable ones.  some considerations, when you lost a valve,,
did you do any other damage??  unless you are very lucky I would not
consider this type of repair a long term permanent fix, although I ran
mine for 4-5 years and over 75,000 miles like that.  check your head very
carefully

&gt;
&gt; When I rebuilt it, I put in the Webcam 107i and their lifters. I could
&gt; never put any pre-set negative clearance on those lifters without
&gt; obvious trouble with some valves staying open. I ran zero clearance or
&gt; even .006 like a mech lifter, but then was not getting the benefit of
&gt; hydraulics.  I am thinking of pulling it and going back to stock (new)
&gt; cam and lifters.  The rebuild was totally with stock except for the cam.
&gt;
&gt; Comments on this?  Better breathing with this cam should have meant
&gt; cooler running, no?

changing a cam changes so many other things that you probably were doing a
&quot;test&quot; just by running it, and the problem could have been from something
totally unconnected.

&gt; Obviously before it goes back in the van there will be a thorough
&gt; reckoning of all factors leading to the overheating problem.

yes, I would do that first before the evidence is &quot;tampered&quot; with.

good luck
Bob
