Subject: Re: [T2] A really stupid question

Boy am I glad that Australia doesn't have the complications mentioned  
below!!  And AFAIK, FI wasn't even an option for Aussie Bays.  i  
believe the first FI models were Vanagons of the 80's.
The worst I normally have to deal with is twin carbs not working as one.
On the other hand, the supply of good SH or NOS parts is pretty  
limited here with nothing like the Busdepot, etc, that is spoken of  
on the list.  Most parts I've needed have been sourced from  
specialist mechanics who have gone to the trouble of getting hold of  
obscure parts.

Still even with that limitation, our 76 2 litre is almost completely  
restored.  Just had the sliding windows removed for me (while they  
replaced the rubbers for the rear window and sliding door glass) so I  
could dismantle, clean off the paint (!!) that the PO put on the  
inside aluminium frames, have the glass tinted and replace the  
sliding felt guides.  Now that that is done, its off to the spray  
painter to finally cover the undercoat with a two colour white over  
blue scheme.
Hopefully, in a few weeks we will be able to enjoy a 'new' bus!!

&gt; Federal is the opposite of California for some parts.
&gt; Busses sold into the United States needed to meet (and
&gt; continue to meet) polution control restrictions for
&gt; the model year sold.  All vehicles were either
&gt; certified with Federal emmissions tests or the tighter
&gt; California emissions tests.
&gt;
&gt; If your bus is 78 California model, then you would
&gt; order a `California` brain (ECU) instead of a Federal
&gt; one.  Likewise, your California model has an oxygen
&gt; sensor the federal models were not fitted with (until
&gt; a year later).
&gt;
&gt; How would this make a difference in part ordering?
&gt; You would select CALIFORNIA-specific part numbers when
&gt; the choice between California and Federal is shown.
&gt; Example:  The Brain, also known as the Electonic
&gt; Control Unit or ECU...California ECU Manual
&gt; transmission part number is 022-906-021AEX, a
