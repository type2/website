Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] It's Alive ! Volks-Air compressor

Hello Guys    I have been using one of these for years . I work real well 
sandblasting, the air will be hot and stinks some. I had trouble running some air 
tools like a DA sander as it would gum up the tool.I run mine at half trottle 
for serious blasting. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
