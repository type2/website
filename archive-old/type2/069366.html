deasterw} I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find 4 RUNS IN THE PAINT.  The painter 
deasterw} assured me that after the paint cured for about a week he would wet 
deasterw} sand and buff the runs out.  He then had the nerve to ask for the 
deasterw} $600 balance due on the paint job. 

For the record, deast, what was the agreed price on the paintjob?

deasterw} At 8:30am the Police arrived to tell me someone complained about the 
deasterw} five buses parked on the street.

You live in a far more tolerant place than I.  Here in Dallas Texas, you would be
cited just for having the five busses!  Even if they all ran!!  I had to get rid 
of my 1959 Impala, because the logistics of replacing the transmission delayed it 
beyond my neighbors' patience.  This car was on a DRIVEWAY!  Completely on my 
property!  Yet the law here says, if it is not running, it is junk.

Yes I'm moving.
