&gt;&gt; When I first fired up the engine and noticed the squeal (on the right side), 

The recently rebuilt engine I had here ,,, had a cyl head leak... it 
actually sounded like chipmunks,, or chickens... not a squeal or whistle. 

sort of a bawk bawk bawk bawk   or chirp chirp chirp 

The cyl barrel protudes in to the head about 5mm,, the head was about 7mm 
deep... so the cyl was sealing on the barrel shoulder instead of the top 
sealing surface. 

I had a machinist &quot;plane&quot; the top off the heads..
at the start, I thought that planeing 2mm off the head would eliminate the 
top fin altogether... but the head was actually shaped like a loaf of 
bread.. so the cutter took off material in the center mostly,, and didn't 
lose the fin at all. 

the head dimensions are in the Bentley for a dual carb and efi engine.. 
5.4-6.5mm.... the heads I had , the hole was around 7.5 mm deep.. depending 
on where you measured it.. 

The original owner of this rebuilt engine put about 8,000 miles on it afaik. 
before he realized there was a problem,, and he thought it was a dropped 
valve seat [again]. 

Check your head stud nuts for torque.. if they are loose at all.. I'll guess 
there is a batch of heads out there that have the same problem.
