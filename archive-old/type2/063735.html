Subject: grease for door slides

OK things happen slowly down here, but I finally got around to fixing the 
sliding door on my 75 kombi (which has been in desperate need of fix for past 
month or so - and I now suspect, minor need of fix for last few years).

After 4 trips to the parts store and 3 broken promises, the parts guy found 
the necessary wheel and plastic thingamajig that goes in the door slide. I 
thought this would be a simple job, but by the time I attacked the surface 
rust that develops in those surfaces that you never see, and painted same 
surfaces, most of the day was gone. I think it is called the &quot;might as 
well....while Ive got it apart&quot; syndrome. 

Anyway when I reassembled it I used wheel bearing grease in all the tracks on 
the door, but I really don't know if this is the stuff to use. I only used 
this because it was what I had from when I recently replaced the clutch cable, 
and it looked nicer than the cv joint grease that was my other alternative :-}

Is there any consensus view about what is appropriate? I checked through my 
manuals and couldn't find any recommendations.
