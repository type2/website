Subject: Auto in the bus

Marshall,

I'm no tranny expert, but far as i know, autos started in 73 in the bus. 
Early ones came with a vacuum module that is undesirable for some (buggy
runners, mainly) but works fine if the lines don't leak. The module might go
bad, but shouldn't be a high-dollar item. Screw right into the outside of the
transmission and is easily accessible.

A 70's VW auto in a bus should go 125 - 175k miles if serviced properly. 
Those are 'soft numbers', but I wouldn't want one (bus auto tranny) with more
than 150k on it.

I speculate further that the rebuild on one of these would be cheaper than on
a std tranny.

cuss/discuss?

&gt; Hi Volks:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) What years were the automatic available for the
&gt; Bus, and how well does it work? Don't bother warning
&gt; me about crumby performance, mileage, etc. These I
&gt; know about. What I want to know is HOW RELIABLE are
&gt; they.
