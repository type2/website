The short version: I adjusted the rear brakes just before Jerome, and it
took a couple of turns of the stars to get the shoes where they should be.
Now, a month later, the brakes are way out of adjustment again, like the
rears are almost non-existant. I've got time off next week, so I'll be
tearing into the brakes and replacing the shoes, and I do have alternative
transportation in the meanwhile.

My musing -- I know that at least one of the little bits of spring steel
that attach to the block that the stars ride in is gone, and others are most
likely weak. I also know that these blocks are NLA.

What do you suppose the odds are that the stars have turned back in on their
own?
What are the parameters (years, models) of these star blocks, if I were to
try and track a pair down at the junk yard?
Are there any other work-arounds?

sounds liely that the little clips that hold the stars from spinning are
broken off.  If the stars are properly greased, they will easily unspin them
selves, deadjusting the brakes.   You can make a little clip and screw it to
the backing plate.   That is easier than changing backing plates.   It will
have to be spring steel or the like so it will spring out will star adjusting,
but spring in to keep it from unravelling.   I did something like that to my
65 I think, when I got it, but I don't remember exactly as it was a while ago.
or you could put crudded up stars in it so it wont turn, but that is a shody
fix. forget I said it.  This does not affect the quality of the shoes, unles
they are worn or damaged it wont help replacing them.
