Subject: Beard Seats and decided on Carb...mabee

 Hello All!

 I just got a sales flier from Beard Suspension Seats and thought, &quot;Boy,
 would I love to sit my tail in one of thoes for a few hours worth of road
 trippin!&quot;  

 Question: Has anyone had any experience with these things?  Is it even 
ppossible to get a set of these things into my Westy?  I hope so cause they
 really look about a million times more comfortable then the seats that are
 in there as it is!

 Regarding my questions about the 34 ICT and distributor conversion, Ive 
 decided to stay with my tried and true 34 pict 3 and vacume advance dist.
 The bus always ran well and I dont want to ruin that just to get the look
 of dual carbs and chrome under the deck lid.  I have decided to snag a 
 Pertronix electronic igniton system as there was nothing but good things
 said about them in the archives.
