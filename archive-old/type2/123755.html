Subject: RE: [T2] Can't find timing any timing marks!

Heh, I'm something of a newb, but shouldn't you be able to find TDC of
#1 compression using the valves as reference, then look on the timing
gauge to see where your mark SHOULD be, and focus your attention their?
Maybe try sanding the back edge where the mark SHOULD be, and as you hit
the mark, the metal will sand to be shiney, but the gap, or mark should
stay dirty. 

Or if that doesn't work, just find TDC using the valves and put your own
paint mark on their? I'm probably missing something. It'll be
interesting to see what it is. :)
