Subject: Grim Reaper and friend

Wasn't it Click 'n' Clack who said the driver's legs were the first line of
defense in a head-on in a Bus?
In related incident...I was waiting for a light in my Bugeye some years ago
when a very inebriated gentleman stopped in front of the car. He looked
at it for a while then, placing one hand on each headlamp, he leaned towards
me.
&quot;You shouldn' be drivin' this,&quot; he said.
&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Too small,&quot; he said, &quot;Kill you. You wanna Buick. Tha' way, you have 'n
assident, is like it's in another country!&quot;
