Subject: Big Pistons Little engine part2 kinda long

I guess I'm going to loose my wallet as well as my mind! Thanks for the
info even if its not what I want to hear.

Here is the situation. I bought a 75 bus with a dead engine. Dropped a
valve guide into number 3 cylinder. Goodby head and #3 piston has a few
nicks . Found a new head same as old and had both rebuilt. Number
stamped in fan housing says it's a 75 1800. Pull it out and tear it
down, case number says it's a 76 2000.

Order parts for 2000. Stupid move. Should have measured. Turns out the
crank and rods are from an 1800. Busted P&amp;Cs probly are too if you are
right about the knob on the little end of the rods interfering with the
pistons. So far I haven't gotten a wrong answer from anyone on the list.
So now I'm almost stuck. It's been a long time since I bought the parts
and I don't know if the FLAPS I got them from will be so friendly when I
try to exchange them. Restocking fees and all.

Along the way I picked up a not so healthy 78 2000. Bad cam, on #3
intake and exhaust have been pounded out into the ports. Haven't
measured yet but crank, rods, case etc. looks good. If it all mics out
ok, here is what I'm thinking.

Using the best of the 2 cases, crank rods and new pistons for the 2000.
The cam from the 1800 is in great shape and the heads are freshly
rebuilt. Put it all together and what do I have? Will this work? OOPS!
Dr. Tim says NO, because of my 75 1800 FI.

Has anyone put a 2000 into a 75 and used the original FI? I brought this
up before and no one said anything about the 75 FI not being able to
support the 2000. I know, that doesn't mean Dr. Tim is wrong! :(  Please
don't take offence Dr. Tim, I mean no disrespect. Oh well, Maybe my luck
hasn't totaly run out and I'll find a ecm and afm from a 2000 cheap,
I've got the rest of the FI stuff from the 78 2000.

Or, should I just measure up the 1800 P&amp;Cs and reuse them on the
original engine. Do you think a few nicks in the top of the piston will
hurt anything for a year or two? Then once my wallet recouperates maybe
I could get the rest of the 78 FI stuff and rebuild the 2000 properly?

My ignorance is not feeling so blissfull at the moment.

All of your help and information is greatly appreciated, Thank you all
sooo much for taking the time to read my ramblings.

Tom

The snow is melting, the days getting longer. Soon it will be time to
enjoy my winters labors.
If I can ever get this ^!*&amp;% bus put back together!
