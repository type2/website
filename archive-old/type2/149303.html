Subject: FS: Wheels and Tires.

4 All Aluminum White 5 spoke American Racing (15x7) wheels and M+S All
Climate Radial tires (P205/65R15) with excellent tread.

 

Includes center caps.

 

Tires are mounted and balanced, and still on my 78 bus.

 

Tires are rated at 1400# each, more than enough for the bus, they drive nice
and grip well.
