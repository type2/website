Subject: Re: [T2] Last of the air cooled vans

&gt; engine
&gt; buses?
&gt; 
&gt;    More than you could imagine...Even if you bought one, the cost of &quot;trying&quot;
to bring it up to US specs would easily pay to bring a wheel to a 
professional
restorer and have a 70's bus built around it... ;-(
