Subject: time for a rebuild | Kadrons?
Message-ID: &lt;382DE09F.E2C9E266_at_home_dot_com&gt;

well, i've decided to have someone just rebuild the 1800 in my '74
westy, rather than put a 2 liter in. the extra cost just didn't seem to
justify the horsepower boost.

but now i'm looking for new carbs, since the single Weber on it just
isn't doing it. I've heard such bad things about the Webers, that I'm
thinking of going with Kadron. I haven't been able to find a good set of
the stock duals.

has anyone had good/bad experiences with the Kadron or Weber dual
replacements? 33/34 or 40's?

thanks,
victor
