This may be rude or stupid, but are you positive the bus in question is 
indeed a Westy original and not a bus converted, that would explain the 
differences in the location of certain items.  Also I've seen people go as 
far out as cutting the engine (attached metal) out and replacing other vins 
to bypass a rebuilders title or legal battle.  I know this may not be the 
case, but a lot of these items in question are explained by how I use to ship 
these things out of Germany, using the loophole system.  Any more questions 
feel free.  And I don't know about other states, but a lot of the California 
entry Westfalia Buses have a set of plates issued to them by the department 
of housing, like an RV, to show it has been inspected and is original at time 
of entry.  Now I know mine is a California rust free bus, but when we noticed 
the plates missing and ran the numbers it came back as the port of entry 
being Florida?  Go figure, But you've got to figure that for as many of these 
bad boys that remain on the road, many rules and ideas have been broken or 
invented to keep the (GOOD FEELING) buses on the road.
Peace Out
