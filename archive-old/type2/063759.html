Subject: FS's and other questions

FS- (i _think_ the p/n is 211 711 613H, check your parts 
manual) NOS &quot;splash pan&quot; for &gt;1968 busses (this bolts 
underneath the pedal assembly under the car to keep road 
debris etc. off the cables) $50.00/ or b.o. US plus shipping

Also does anybody know where to get a mixing code or a close 
match for a Light Grey (Licht Grau?) paint for my 1960 Kombi 
(i would like to do some touch ups)

Also looking for a very nice NOS or good used interior rear 
view mirror for my 60' Kombi (I know that they didn't come 
with them originally)

Also I am looking for a decent set of used (read un or 
minimally rusted heater boxes) for a 1600DP

Please contact me privately
