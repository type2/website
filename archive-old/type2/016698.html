Hi Mark,

I'm on digest and I didn't see a response to your query so...

Idiot light on with key off is a sign of the contacts in the voltage
regulator sticking.  This means that the battery is feeding 12v to the
stator in the alternator when it shouldn't be.  Usually, if one is quick
and disconnects the battery, no harm is done.  However, if one doesn't
disconnect, the alternator fries and the battery goes dead.  So... If
you scurried right out and disconnected the battery, you'll need a new
regulator.  If not, I afraid that you are going to have to replace both
the alternator and the regulator (which is usually a good idea anyway.)

Oh, and BTW, the alternator R&amp;R is a PIA.  Nowhere near as easy as a
Vanagon but much easier than an upright.  I guess that makes it about a
2.5 banana job.

&gt; Well, today on my way home from
&gt; work, lights got real dim, engine got a little jerky from what seemed like
&gt; lack of fuel, and then when I did get home and I turned the key off and
&gt; removed the key, the alternator light stayed on.  This seemed very odd.  So
&gt; I tried to start the ol' bus again and the alt. light went off (when it
&gt; should be on) and there was no response from the starter at all, but the
&gt; fuel pump did turn on with the key.  hmmmmmm. Any insight on this goofy
&gt; phenomenon??
