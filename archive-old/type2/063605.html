Subject: Brake Warning Light

Hi Volks,

While driving the freeway to work this morning, the brake
warning light came on ('71 bus), I tried the brake and all
seemed to be fine.  When stopping, the light would go out,
then would come back on again after driving a moment.
Got to work ok, opened up Muir's book to find nothing
regarding this problem (he mentions the warning light
coming on while braking), any ideas?
