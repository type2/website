Subject: Auto Tranny

    I have a 74 Westy with a stock automatic transmission in it.  I
having problems and wish to replace it with a manual.
    I was wondering if any one had done this conversion before.  I need
info on axle lengths, tranny mounts, clutch cable tube, and anything
else.  I am running a 2.0L with FI.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Frankie
