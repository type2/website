Any mechanic who insists the t-stat is unnecessary is someone you should
*never* take your VW to, unless you live in a 180 F climate.  They're
thinking caps are broken.

Yes your old t-stat is most likely fine...save it and sell it in a few years
for buku bucks ;-)

Hi Steve,
I guess the temp rating I got is ok, based on what you said.  I will indeed
adjust the flaps accordingly.  What I'm thinking now, is that the original
thermostat may have been ok, since I was testing it at 65C (when it's rated
85).  Oh well, if that's the case I have a spare now.
Indeed, a lot of engineering went into the design of these aircooled
engines, including the cooling components (ie. thermostat etc.).  Given that
I plan on driving it mostly in the summer, some people had said that a
thermostat was not absolutely warranted, and many rebuilders apparently
don't bother putting one on, but I felt that it's important to build the
engine as the designers intended, which meant to include the thermostat etc.
I gather they're getting scarce now.  VW Canada still have a dozen or so in
their national inventory.  NOt cheap: about $50US for just the thermostat
(no bracket, hardware or cable).
Regards,
  --RObert
