&gt; Nikki stayed the night with me and my wife last wedns in lubbock,TX on her
&gt; way to phoenix and I hadn't checked my email til today and saw all the
&gt; trouble she had. I feel bad now cause I almost gave her my 009 w/ compufire
&gt; cause I had recently put in a mallory. We got off the subject of dist. and I
&gt; had just plain forgot about it. :(  Does anyone know if she is up and going
&gt; again?  Does she still need a dist?  I can ship her mine if she is still in
&gt; need.  Let me know if you know anything. Thanks

Casey (and everyone),

As of last night Nikki's bus was running fine and she was going to leave
El Paso headed for Arizona this morning.  I have not heard from her today,
but as of last night all was well. She bought a new 009 and installed it
with the help of Leo Escandon.  My profound thanks and three cheers for
Leo!!!!
