Subject: Re: paint over por


&gt;This is completely true.  If you use POR-15, you either have to sand it to
&gt;rough up the surface, or use their special primer.  I chose to use the
&gt;special primer.  It actually works very well, and have used it over the
&gt;whole body of my bus.  It acts like a build-up type of primer, and
&gt;wet-sands really well.


i believe they also say you can spray a light coat of paint or primer over
the por15 WHEN SLIGHTLY WET to give it some tooth for the next layer.
