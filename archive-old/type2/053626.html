Subject: Re: Idle problem

Hi there Ted,

I have this happen to me every once in a while also with my '71 bus.  I run a
fuel filter between my fuel pump and carb, and after about 2000 miles it will
start giving me trouble.  When i put on the brakes to come to a stop, my idle
will drop considerably and the engine will even want to quit sometimes.  Try
replacing your fuel filter.

I seem to remember you were fiddling around with your idle cutoff solenoid in
Detroit?  Are the threads stripped out on the carb?  Mine are, and i had that
problem from about Chicago to Detroit and i finally figured it out the day I
left to come back to WI.

Hope this helps...
