Subject: Re: [T2] ATV jackstand for engine drop

I used a $59 ATV jack from Kragen to drop and install the engine for my '82 
Westy. Piece of cake.

You can also use the ATV jack as a work stand to strip the tin and other
component pieces off the old engine and to put the stuff back on the new
one. I went as far as installing the exhaust while the new engine was on the
jack.
