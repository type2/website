&gt; On one end of the thermostat is a brass &quot;nut&quot; that screws into the
&gt; thermostat.  One side of this &quot;nut&quot; is closed off, except for a small hole
&gt; in the middle.  Unscrew this &quot;nut&quot; and pass the thermostat cable through
&gt; this hole from the threaded side of the &quot;nut&quot; such that the small
&gt; molded-in barrel on one end of the cable is captured inside the nut.
&gt; Then screw the nut back on the thermostat.
&gt; 
&gt; The thermosat basically &quot;floats&quot; inside the bracket, that is the
&gt; thermostat and bracket are not attached one to the other.  The bracket
&gt; attaches to the engine with the 2 small studs that are there for that
&gt; purpose, trapping the thermostat inside.
Tom and Tom:
Uh, beg to differ with you, but the thermostat does not float in the
bracket! The thermostat is mounted solidly to the front of the bracket
with a short M8 bolt and washer. The rear of the thermostat then moves
the cable forward when cold and rearward when hot, thus relaxing the
spring tension on the shaft and opening the flaps.
