Hi there. I'm looking for the round &quot;support&quot; to be found at the base of the
steering column... its held in place by two screws and serves to keep the
steering column tube &quot;steady&quot;.  The one I have is rusted and busted out of
shape.   Trouble is, this part can only be removed if either the entire
steering column is removed or if the steering wheel is removed.  

If anyone has one to sell, or knows where I cab buy one, please let me know!
