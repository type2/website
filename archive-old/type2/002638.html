Sounds great the only problem I can see is if the extra feet of wire causes
increased resistance(which it should unless you place something to account
for the extra resistance with-in the circuit.) it would not operate exactly
on. I don't know if it does but if you have an O-scope you could check it to
make sure. I don't really know enough electronics to say more but I am sure
someone on this list does.

&gt; John,
&gt;
&gt; I am gonna take a shot at describing my experience with making a dip stick
&gt; temp gauge. I think it works great and cost me about $25. I believe there
is
&gt; a post in the library by Mike Benthin, which is where I got the idea. Mike
&gt; was glad to help me along.
&gt; You need:
&gt; 1. A digital meat thermometer. There are several types at Wal-Mart. The
one
&gt; I used cost $20. It is different than most in that the digital readout
&gt; screen is remote from the metal probe. The probe (imagine a stainless
steel
&gt; ball-point pen refill) has the sensor in its tip. two wires run from this
&gt; sensor and out the top of the probe. The probe is crimped where the wires
&gt; exit. The wires continue for about four feet and are molded into a plug
&gt; which looks sorta like a plug for headsets. The plug can be plugged into
the
&gt; digital read out box, which is about the size of a wallet. Now, the probe
is
&gt; not straight. It curves at its top, forming a handle for pushing/pulling
the
&gt; probe into/out of meats.  This needs to be straightened out, which I did
for
&gt; the most part by hand. I used the little side table on my Westy as a soft
&gt; vice to finish the job. Now, this straightening process may form some
crimps
&gt; which will be of no consequence.
&gt; 2. You need a piece of brass tubing, the OD of which will fit down you
&gt; dip-stick tube. It has to have a ID that will accommodate the
&gt; now-straightened probe. I found such a tube at only one place, a hobby
shop,
&gt; and they had plenty of them in different sizes. Bring the probe and your
&gt; dipstick with you when you go to buy the tube. This will ensure that you
buy
&gt; a tube of the correct length and diameter. The crimps might make the probe
&gt; slightly wider at points. Gently file these down if necessary.
&gt; 3. You need some 2 part, slow-setting epoxy.
&gt; 4. You need some wire which will be spliced into the 4 foot wire provided
&gt; with the thermometer. I used doorbell wire.
&gt; 5, You need a washer that will go around the brass tube and act as a dip
&gt; stick stop.
&gt; 6. You need a small piece of rubber hose that will go around the top of
the
&gt; brass tube and act as a handle as well as keep the wires that will run up
&gt; the tube from the now-set-in-epoxy probe from crimping.
&gt; I will describe the rest as briefly as I can. Cut the provided wire near
the
&gt; plug. Run the wires up through the tube. Epoxy probe into tube, making
sure
&gt; it is set to extend approximately 3&quot; beyond bottom of tube. Fill tube
&gt; w/epoxy as best you can. Epoxy washer at correct height to allow tip of
&gt; probe to stop its downward travel just sort of the bottom of the sump. Run
&gt; wires through piece of rubber hose then push hose onto tube. Splice about
12
&gt; feet of wire to wires coming out of probe. Run wires to front of bus then
&gt; splice wires to plug.  Plug into digital thing. Voila! Now you can monitor
&gt; you oil temp, you engine compartment temp, the ambient temp, and yes, even
&gt; your body temp!  Now, this is important. I said there were two wires, but
&gt; that is not exactly correct, although it did make it a little easier to
&gt; describe this process. Actually there is one wire inside a metal/mesh
&gt; sheath. The sheath itself acts as the second wire. The wire inside the
&gt; sheath gets spliced.  A wire must also be secured to both ends of the
&gt; sheath. I simply slid a piece of wire under each end of the cut sheath and
&gt; secured with epoxy. There are different types of thermometers and
obviously
&gt; different ways of making this thing. I had no soldering gun,  so
everything
&gt; got glued together. The design of the meat thermometer with its remote,
&gt; plug-in read screen out made it superior to those of uni-construction
which
&gt; involve disassembly and soldering some rather short, delicate wires. One
&gt; other point: I keep my regular dipstick in the engine compartment to take
&gt; oil measurements as I could not get a good reading off the brass tube.
