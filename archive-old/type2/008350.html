&gt; While I wholeheartedly agree with most of what you are saying I must
&gt; take exception to one part: Iowa has no procedure for getting a title
&gt; for a vehicle which has been junked. Several years ago one could work
&gt; around this situation with an Alabama title, but no more. I guess
&gt; legislators in their infinite wisdom wanted to protect consumers from
&gt; unscrupulous car dealers and figured if anyone said to the state &quot;
this
&gt; is a junk car&quot; they did not want the process reversed...

Wow!  Iowa seems to be out to lunch on this issue!  How do the antique
car folks live with this rule, since they seem to resurrect old Model
As and such from far sorrier piles of junk than most of us do buses?

The Iowa motor vehicle people would seem to encourage fraud by being
so restrictive.
