Well Andy as I write, all four flexible brake hoses on the bus had some sort
of bubble on the outside of the flexible brake hose.  If I pressed hard
enough, fluid would come out of the cracks. I am awaiting a fourth brake
hose that needs to be male on one end and female on the other. This is the
left (drivers side) rear.  In the mean time I have decided to take apart,
part of the exhaust were the CO2 sensor should be installed. Let me give you
a little background. This 79 load didn't have an engine and a hold lot of
other things when I purchased it 24 months ago.  I was able to get a few
months later a 2.0 FI out of another bus.  However this 2.0 didn't have any
smog stuff on it. Slowly I have been getting all the necessary stuff to put
back on it. A week ago I went through Washington State smog and the bus
failed the CO portion of the test. I quickly took the bus over to Halsey
Motors in Portland were they adjusted the unit and then it passed.  However
it just made it!!  Without the CO2 sensor in it, I don't think the computer
can judge the mixture. Thats just me speaking. Since I have been unable to
find the right exhaust piece for the setup, today I am going to go to a nut
and bolt shop, find a nut that fits the new CO2 sensor threads and have a
welding shop weld the nut in the exhaust piece. I am going to guess were the
correct position is going to be since I can't find any real pictures of how
or where this item is install, except that its on top of this y-corner piece
of exhaust.  Have you seen any pictures of an exhaust system 77-79 that
clearly shows were the CO2 sensor is positioned?? And thanks for your help
on the flexible brake lines.
