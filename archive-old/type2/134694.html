Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

&gt; I get the sense that maybe I'm asking too many questions.
&gt;
&gt; But consider the aim: I want a bus in my driveway that I could climb
&gt; into on a moment's notice and drive from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine
&gt; and back with just an oil change in Bar Harbor. No &quot;can it make it?&quot; No
&gt; calls on AIRS. Just driving, looking at the scenery, and listening to
&gt; Allman Brothers on my iTunes.
&gt;
&gt; And if I can do it, anybody can do it.
&gt;

&gt;
 I already have a bus like that--a 74 Riviera hardtop with an AVP 1.8ltr
long block. Except for new tires, I wouldn't hesitate to drive it anywhere

Relax a little; you should be enjoying this more and stressing less. Too
much paranoia can infect the engine so that it will never be right, no
matter how carefully you build it.

Regards,
Dave
