Subject: Hot Brakes

Greetings,
   I had the hot shoe syndrome on the '69 last week.  The right rear
wheel got so hot that I couldn't touch it and the grease melted out.
At first I thot it was a bearing, which can be a bitch to change.  But
upon trying to bleed the brakes I noted that one of them would not bleed.
It was the right rear of course.  That brake hose had gotten clogged like
all of them seem to do about the 25th year.  What was happening was that
just enough fluid was being forced thru to push the shoes to the drum,
but there was not enough pressure for the fluid to go back, thus holding
the shoe down.  It was kinda ballooning when the brakes were applied too. :O
  An interesting note about the back brakes on a '69;  the hose on the
right rear has two female ends on it, while the left rear has a male end
and a female end like the front.  These things do have their peculiarities.
I've had a hard time getting the right hoses down at the FLAPS.

  Drive on,  Chris  '69, '71 Westys etc.
