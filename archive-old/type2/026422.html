Steve Blackham responded with the correct answer to which of the injector-type connectors when where:

Thermo time switch     =    Brown
Auxiliary Air Regulator =    Black
Cold Start                  =    Blue

An interesting feature, as I mapped this out, is that the male ends on the devices themselves matched colorwise. Now I feel a little silly...so I thought I'd share with the other 3 or 4 listees wondering about this. You're out there; you know you are. ;) Joe
