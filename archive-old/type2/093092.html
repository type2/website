Good idea.  First verify compression.  A compression test would be best but 
a quickie check is the poor-man's cylinder balance test that Jason just 
described.  I do this all the time because it is a 10-second test that, if 
passed indicates that comrpession is even and spark and fuel are present in 
all cylinders.  That's a lot of good information to have.  If it fails the 
test, you have something obvious to go after.

If it passes this test, I'll be wondering if the cam timing may be off - I 
sure hope that's not it though.  Another possibility - plugged exhaust, any 
chance of that?  Do you have the old carb to try?

p.s. pull the plug wires at the dizzy, not at the plug.  Don't pull off the 
center wire.  :)
