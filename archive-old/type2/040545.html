Subject: First engine/tranny pull

Hey all!  My first message here today, love the list.  Also my first tranny
pull coming up this weekend.  Replacing tranny, my seals/synchro's
everything in the existing tranny about to burst like a beer left in the in
the freezer!  Gonna do the seals on the replacement tranny I've got and the
gaskets for the heck of it.  Question:  Anything else you all would
reccommend doing while I've got the tranny and motor out.  Maybe the engine
seal as well? How difficult is the nose cone seal to do-Iherd it was tough?
(How difficult is the rear tranny seal for that matter?) I heard someone say
something about this prussian blue stuff?  What the heck is that all about?
(I'm not much of a tranny buff) Oh yea, the stats:  My bus is a  ' 74.  The
engine is a 2.0L, Porsche 914 motor.  The tranny I'm putting in is a Volks
tranny.  The clutch plate was supposedly done when the new engine was, but I
have not seen it for myself yet.  Engine is a newly rebuilt one with about
6,500 miles on it.  SO..engine seal may not need replacing but I don't want
to miss anything simple like that I should do while I've got the motor
sitting in my driveway.   (I have read the transmission section in the
library on Type2_dot_com, but I'm green and I'm a visual type person who won't
really get it until I get my hands into it, but I would like to know a
little in advance what I should think about replacing.  Since you all are so
intelligent about this stuff.....HELP!)

Thanks all
Truckin' D in the ' 74
