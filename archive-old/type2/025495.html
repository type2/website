Ben Hirashima sends:

&gt; i'm also thinking about painting the fiberglass top. i've seen a few other
&gt; type IIs around town with a glossy finish on their tops, which looks pretty
&gt; sharp. anybody know how to achieve this effect? can it be done by an amateur
&gt; for cheap? are they just using new vanagon tops, or is the secret in the
&gt; paint?

You just use paint, Ben; hit http://www.sikkens_dot_net and download the
Polysurfacer (TDS 3.5.1) Colorbuild Undercoat System (TDS 3.2.18) and
Autosurfacer 940HS (TDS 3.2.12) technical data sheets. Those are the Sikkens
primers for fiberglass.

Then, if you can't get or can't afford Sikkens paint (which is expensive),
take these to the local paint store and ask if they have anything similar.
They should.
