1)    There are different sizes of stock crank pulleys.  Don't know why.  But
there they are. I think there are at least 5 sizes.  I personally like a
larger pulley as it turns the fan more.

2)what is all this peace and love hippy stuff- flame wars on!!!   who cares
about buses, or even self absorbbed trip reports?    I want screaming mad
emotion.  &lt;0&gt; yup yup uhuh.  just kidding.  Is everyone getting enough sleep?
 
3) a woman who is into buses (not because of her man) is a woman in a very
male area.   Yes, it takes an eccentric type to go there, to boldly go where
few women have gone before.   But it isn't really a choice.  I was born that
way.  Maybe I was raised that way.   I don't think I decided it.   I'm not a
feminist, I just like to work on my VW.  (to paraphase the Texan pro wrestling
women)  This may well be linked with other convention bucking characteristics,
and views of the world.   It does not, however, mean that she has an easier
time finding a good man.   Many guys, while thinking it would be kewl to have
a vw head girlfriend, may have to face the realities that 

she may wash engine parts by boiling them on the kitchen stove, 
not want him to work on her bus, 
may want him to help her with the bus,  
 she may  tell him to leave her alone and she'll fix it w/o his advice or
help, 
 tell him he needs to fix his bus,
 she suddenly wants to bring home another junky old bus,
  she uses the garage space for her car(s) and snakes his gear oil,
 she insists that the nuts and bolts be organised alphabetically, 
 he finds she had to deal with bad attitudes people have about womens and
mechanics and she may be a bit of a butthead or touchy in response, 
  or be upset because she'd rather go junkyarding than spend time with him,
 feel an ego threat if she knows more than him,  
feel she does not fill a vision of womanliness when greasy and suddenly
realise he doesn't like it he liked the idea of it and  it reality got old, 
or  that he has a lowered bus and she thinks that lowering is dumb and safaris
are too.

     believe you me, i have gone out with some guys who thought they liked me
being a VW head, but really didn't, or had issues.    

Then again, sometimes you can hang out in the garage and futz with the bus,
maybe drink a beer,  and have a good old time.  And  I've taken some
girlfriends to VW shows, who said it's a great place to meet hot guys.  :)

Hey Melissa, you rock!  It's too bad there aren't more Bitches w/Wrenches
around as it would be cool to do the VW things w/

4) This list feels like a community, in spite of (because of?) the bickering
recently.  Kinda like a small town.  Pretty cool.  Maybe it just brought out
that are a lot of familiar names on the list.    Hooray for the various
listmeisters who have made this possible!!!  I was getting into VWs in my
teens in California and was lucky enough to have friends into their VWs who
helped me figure out how to tune it up etc.   I had a hard time looking at the
idiot book and turning it into action.  The other books were way beyond me.
Thanks to the people who encouraged  (tolerated?) me, although I doubt they
are on this list.     hey- anyone though of making a &quot;how to tune up your bus&quot;
video?    That would be cool.
