OK, I know you are getting tired of me by now but I wouldnt ask these
questions if I didnt need the info.

I bought a complete gasket set for my 1800 to do the rebuild.  now it
looks like I will be splitting the case and putting new bearings in the
bottom end as well.  What other gaskets or seals, if any, will I need
now?  Is everything I need in the kit?

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
