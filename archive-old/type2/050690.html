&gt;&gt; I am in the middle of doing my rear brakes and CV's and I noticed that my

&gt;&gt; (besides having the wheel attached) ?

There is a bizzare possibility to explain the difference (other than the fact
that the splines may just be tighter on the one axle) that being a '68 it
may still have the original joints with the original dished spacer washers
under (towards the center of the axle) CV's.  Those should be deleted.
Like Gerorge said, they should slide back and forth.
