    Im all jazzed about this! One point...IM NOT SAYING THAT BLUE ISNT
ROADWORTHY but...... I do hear a slight rod knock that I will have to take
care of and SOON! Wich I beleive begs the ? What about the Bus impaired who
are currently in the middle of projects? It wouldnt be a bad idea to also
send to the RALLY MASTER or GATHERER OF NAMES the names of people willing to
pay their way and people willing to take a rider. Maybe something can be
co-ordinated with cities and single drivers looking for a passenger to
defray some cost and at the very least help with road repairs wich, dont get
me wrong, NEVER HAPPEN!!!!!
    That way even more Listees are involved, the more diverse the better!!!
DONT LET THIS GREAT IDEA DIE!!!!! ( i know it wont)
