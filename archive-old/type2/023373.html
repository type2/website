Subject: Our turn to help

    I have seen many people on the lists appear out of nowhere and comment
on the events of our nation and many that always post also comment.
    Do you think that it's time that those of us in the VW world ban
together and try to help the victims of this horrific tragedy??
    Is there a way all of the list could join forces, set up a fund, and
take donations from all list members and send it to the appropriate parties
on behalf of the VW community.

THINK about, WE cam help.
   
    Trying to help

ronnie

ps. Please forward this to any other vw list if you agree, it can be done
