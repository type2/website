Subject: Re: [T2] E Brake Warning Light Lens

VW# 113 919 233 B

This is the entire warning light assembly, lens was never available
separately.  Fits:

Std Beetles 72-77
Super Beetle 1972
K Ghia Late 72-73
Type 2 68-79

Not to be confused with 111 919 233 B Warning Light, which was similar and
you pushed the lens to &quot;test&quot; the light while the vehicle's engine was
running.  The electrical connections for this unit is different and not
interchangeable with the one you're looking for.  That one fit:

Std Beetles 68-71
Super Beetle 1971
K Ghia 68-Early 72

Time to hit the boneyards.  I'll have to check my stash and see if I have
anything, but it's been awhile.

&gt; Hey all. If this is old hat I apologize - I searched the archives but
&gt; cannot
&gt; find what I need.
&gt; This is probably the least of our worries but can someone point me to a
&gt; source for the Lens that covers the emergency brake warning light on the
&gt; dash? I've been told they are the same as a beetle but I'm not having any
&gt; luck.
&gt; Thanks ahead of time
