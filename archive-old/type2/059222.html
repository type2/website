Subject: Re: oil filter location on '71 bus

On my 71 bus years ago I put an additional oil cooler UNDER the bus between
the frame rails in the middle.  Used hoses that ran to pipes I welded to
the sump plate so the oil was sucked from the sump thru the cooler/oil
fiter and then up the pickup pipe, which had an extension on it to the sump
plate.
Since this setup was lower than the sump, I never worried about any
drainback!.   Reliable?  Well, it got me around a trip all around the
country, and ran cool enough in the mountains.....
