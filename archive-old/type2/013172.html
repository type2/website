Michael Benthin:

I sincerely appreciate your reply on Camper Conversion.

I just returned from a BugFeat at Texas Motorspeedway in Ennis Texas (35
miles south of Dallas).
About ten campers and busses were camped out at Bardwell Resivour Core of
Engineers park Staurday night.

Although ten campers/vans do not make up a major represenative block of
available combinations. Each van/camper owner seemed very pleased with
the specific functions his particular van offered. Almost everyone had
made the minor modifications to his van that matched it better to his
particular needs. 

There were only two 80-91 Westfalias there and I was there in my
aircooled 83. There was one 98 Euro Conversion and other Westy's and vans
going back as far as 1969.

The customizations consisted of liquor cabinets, microwave ovens, spare
tire racks, roof racks, gun racks, portable sinks, portable butane
cookers, ladders, awnings, supplimental tent assemblies, removable
outside showers, tube containers on roof racks for tent poles, modified
sleeping arrangements.

The only units without visible modifications were the EuroVan, my 83
Westfalia and a 87 Westfalia.

I am very pleased with what my Westfalia has as standard configuration
although I carry a small electric bathroom heater in chilly weather and a
small hang on window air conditioner in summer months when I know I'm
going to have electricity at my camping location. I use a small 12 volt
TV with built-in vcr and since I play guitar I have an input jack into my
car radio so I can use it as an amplifier when I practice on camping
trips. I also carry a WalMart $59.00 bicycle for those hurry up trips to
the potty. I also have 8x10 removable speakers that I can use out of the
van with long patch cords. So I'm guilty of customizing my Westfalia, the
portable speakers and new style radio are the only visible modification
you can immediately identify as non VW OEM.

There are normally only two people sleeping in my van but I carry an 8x8
four man tent and a half dozen moving pads when we're meeting others or
plan to be out for more than a weekend.

I'd like to find a good quality nesting cookware set and reduce the size
of my sppplimental gear box that normally resides outside when I'm
camping.

I've ridden out some major six and ten storms in my Westfalia, both while
camping and at roadside and I just wouldn't trade anything for the sink
and stove during these times. I usually use these occasions to thououghly
clean the interior of my van, shave, trim my beard, watch a movie or read
a book.

I find the swivel fron seats help to lessen the feeling of confinement
during the evening hours and those surprise cold snaps.
