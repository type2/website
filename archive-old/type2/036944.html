Subject: Bumper Bolts

I tried searching the archives on this but could not find specific advice.
The rear bumper on my 70 westy is mangled badly. I wanted to take the whole
thing off including the brackets mounted to the frame as they are bent. Two
of the bolts came off no problem. The other two just turn, turn, turn. Is
there a nut welded inside the frame that has broken loose? How do you
suggest I get these bolts out? Any help for this amateur mechanic would be
much appreciated.

Jeff and the un-named 70 westy.
