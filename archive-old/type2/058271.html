Subject: Re: Getting an out-of-state bus home?

&gt;If you buy a bus out of state how do you get it home

Here in Maine one can get a &quot;transit plate&quot; good for a one way, one time, 
14 day maximum trip from place of purchase to back home in Maine.  You 
must show evidence of insurance on the vehicle in question and fork over 
a $10 fee in order to get a transit plate.  Perhaps a similar arrangement 
can be had in Connecticut or other states.

Good luck,

Tony
