&gt; &gt;Part of the instructions for the valve adjustment is to chock the tires,
&gt; &gt;put the vehicle in neutral, and disengage the parking brake. What does
&gt; &gt;this accomplish as re: the valves?

&gt; 
&gt; well to set the valves you need to turn the crank by way of a wrench on the crank
&gt; pulley nut. If you don't take the van out of gear to do this, you will be using your
&gt; wrench like an old crank, trying to start the motor with the wrench, plus it's difficult
&gt; to turn the motor with the van in gear. So if the van is out of gear and you are working
&gt; on it without chocks, it might roll over you if there is an earthquake or some other reason like a car

of course if you have an AUTOMATIC, you can leave it in PARK...... since
the torque convertor will allow the engine to turn while it is still in
gear or locked up...


of course it is wise to ALWAYS chock the vehicle before getting under it
no matter what!

Safety, SAFETY, SaFeTy,,,,, first, last, always!!!
