&gt; Subject: Unleaded fuel
&gt; 
&gt; Hallo,
&gt; 
&gt; three years ago I wrote to Volkswagen for their meaning on using unleaded
&gt; 
&gt; fuel in the VW Transporter. They answered that all VWs since 1975 can use
&gt; 
&gt; unleaded fuel with no limitation. They had run new test on the engines. I
&gt; 
&gt; drive my 1975 camper (1.8 ltr) with unleaded fuel since then and the  
&gt; engine is running pretty well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
	  NOTE: The following  is only an opinion, not technical knowledge!
	There has been some talk about 'how well' a car will run 
	on unleaded fuel. When Canada switched, I did not notice 
	any differnece in how any of my cars ran. I also in all the
discussions
	with people I never heard anyone mentioned  that the switch
	to unleaded fuel affected performance in any way??
