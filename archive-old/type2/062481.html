Bob,

Canned compressed &quot;air&quot; is available at photo shops, for cleaning camera
lenses.  The quotes are because the contents were really freon (this was
back in the bad old days).  I stopped using it a while ago, but the photo
shop downstairs from my office says they still sell a non-freon version.
