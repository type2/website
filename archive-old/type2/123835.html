Subject: RE: [T2] bus stalling

&gt;&gt;&gt; stalls when i first start her up in the moring  &lt;&lt;&lt;

Ok, here's my GUESS. I'm sure you'll get a CORRECT answer soon. :) I'm
guessing that your cold start valve (basically a fifth fuel injector) is
either not injecting it's fuel, or cutting out too soon. It's controlled
by a thermostat. And if that thermostat isn't working, the cold start
valve won't start either. I'm betting theirs an easy continuity test to
do on a dead cold engine to make sure the thermostat is grounding
correctly. 

Now lets let a pro step in and see how close I was to being right. :) 

Cheers
