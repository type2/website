Subject: [T2] alternative power charging

hey volks,
being its friday and all i thought id pose a question
to some of the rather bright listmembers.   ive read
occasional posts on charging extra batteries with
solar panels now and again.   lately i have been
surfing around looking up information on alternative
power in houses since i have a friend currently living
sans electricity and running water.   where the bus
related part comes in is.....i was wondering if anyone
has thought about &quot;wind power&quot; to charge a battery.  
windmills can do a good job of supply electricity to a
home so why not some type of turbine, wind powered
generator on a bus.   driving down the road would
cause it to turn and could charge a couple batteries
for camp.   i do realize this would not work out so
well when camping but i was just brainstorming.   ill
stop rambling...
have a good weekend
