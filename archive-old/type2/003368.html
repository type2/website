Dave said look for a clean place. I can find no clean place.

I had to take some pics today. There is oil everwhere. How can it get from
the cooler to the tin abve all four jugs? How does it get inside AND outside
the fan housing? I am stumped. Look at the carb.

Take a look if you have a strong stomach:

Any input?

Subject: Oil cooler leak?


&gt; I finally got around to pulling the engine out of the 69 camper today to
&gt; look for the leak. I had taken it to the car wash and sprayed the
&gt; compartment down a bit last week, but still very dirty. When I pulled the
&gt; fan housing off, I thought it would be obvious where the oil was coming
from
&gt; but it is not. There simply is oil everywhere! The case is covered; the
tin
&gt; above the cylinders is covered. The cooler itself is amazingly clean. How
&gt; can I tell if I am on the right track? The cylinder fins are covered in
&gt; nasty oil. I would have thought my overheating episode would have burned
&gt; that off!
&gt;
&gt; What does a leaky front seal look like? There was some oil in the bell
&gt; housing. Clutch was dry. The throw out bearing was being held in by only
one
&gt; clip. I guess that is where that funny noise was coming from. I found the
&gt; clip in the little offset area in the housing where the starter comes into
&gt; the housing. Wonder how that got there!
&gt;
&gt; On the subject of over heating, I did find some garg on the fan. Fibrous
&gt; long hair like stuff caked in oil. Not enough to cause any blockage, but I
&gt; suspect enough to slightly decrease the efficiency of the fan. Does the
&gt; &quot;Hover bit&quot; bolt on to the front (fif) of the oil cooler? If so, I found
it
&gt; in pieces under the cooler, or was that some thing else important?
&gt;
&gt; Any input appreciated.
