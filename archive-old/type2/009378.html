&gt; About 11 months ago I went to Tires Plus and said I needed tires for
my '72
&gt; westy. &quot;I have just the tire for you&quot; He set me up with these low
profile
&gt; 195s with a load rating of 1120 lbs.  At the time I did not know the
&gt; difference --  My speedometer was off and these tire really did not
look
&gt; right.  When I took the van out of storage this spring one of the
tire was
&gt; flat, so I put on the spare.  This really highlighted wrong these
tires
&gt; were.
&gt; 
&gt; So here I am 11 months later with these tire I do not feel comfortable
&gt; with -- I decide to try to return them.  I spoke Charlie, the
manager tires
&gt; plus.  To my surprise he apologized, gave my full credit for my
tires and
&gt; ordered me a set of reinforced Michelin MX 185R14.
&gt; 
&gt; While I was disappointed that this happened in the first place, I
was quite
&gt; pleased at how well they took care of the situation.

That's a heck of a good tire store.  I'd go back there even if they
aren't the cheapest around!

&gt; The Tires? They ride nice, my speedo works and rated at 1520 lbs.

If your bus suddenly develops a mysterious vibration, be sure to check
your tires for tread separation, which shows up as heavily worn spots
on the tire or obviously lumpy tread.  You don't want to peel a tread
and wipe out your sheet metal!  While otherwise excellent, Michelins
do have a reputation for tread separations.
