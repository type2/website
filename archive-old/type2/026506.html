Subject: RE: difference between 914 tin and bus tin ?
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8EF1_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I got a 2l bus motor yesterday and the fellow had used it in a 914 
&gt;for motivation for a while and had put 914 cooling tin on it ( he said ) 
&gt;-- is there a difference between 914 tin and &quot;regular&quot; bus tin ??

I never saw this one answered.  The answer is YES, they are different.  The
914 engine bay is square and flat where the cylinder tin goes into the
corners to the left and right of the cooling shroud (rear in bus, front in
914).  Also, the 914 tin has a 90 degree lip around the outside edge of the
tin because of how the rubber engine seal works.
