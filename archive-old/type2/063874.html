Subject: re:Original license plates

A number of states will allow you to use plates from a particular year.  The
sitpulation is that you locate the plates yourself(check swap meets). You need
to have them with you at the time you go to register the plates, as they will
need to be inspected, to ensure they are up to standards (ie not rusted beyond
recognition), and that they are not currently registered to someone else
(stolen).  I am sure that there will be a small registration fee, but not
too much.

Hope this helps.

After seeing some of the older model type IIs at the VW Jamboree in Costa
Mesa this weekend I had a question concerning license plates I hope someone
could answer.  I saw quite a few vehicles with the original (black on yellow)
California license plates.  Did these people just get increadibly lucky and
purchase their resto projects with the original plates?  Or is there a way to
go through the DMV to get the original plate re-issued?  It seems like
re-issuing original plates would be next to impossible but states do seem to
be printing different variety of plates these days and maybe that's a new
option I'm not aware of.
