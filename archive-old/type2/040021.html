Subject: 12v elec files 2nd list send

Hi,
For everybody who didn't get in on the first send that went
out yesterday,
I'll do another send tomorrow 5/18.

It's 50 assorted help and info files on
batteries/charging/diagnosis/isolators,
and more, collected from all over the web, stuffed to about
350k.

The first list went to about 30 people.

Anybody else who wants on the second list send me an email
asap.
If you asked already you don't need to re-ask unless you
think you got left out.

Cutoff will be around noon.

Anybody having problems downloading and reading let me know
and we'll find some way to solve it.

be cool........... ;-)
