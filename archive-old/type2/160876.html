Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Ignition Issue

Hi,

Solved the jumpy timing issue. Replaced the cap and points. Cap had
some carbonization of the internal terminals. Installed a new one that
I received with the ACN SVDA (I kept the old cap on when I installed
the distributor originally, seemed to fit and work fine). Points
looked fine, they were the heavy duty ones with the black and white
lead. Replaced with regular points (with the black lead).

Timing holds steady now. Yay!

Still gotta track down the electrical problem that is preventing the
Hot Spark from working correctly when the headlights are off. Perhaps
tomorrow.

peace

&gt; &gt; Maybe my timing light is second rate combined with a weak spark is
&gt; &gt; causing the timing to &quot;appear&quot; to be jumpy. Maybe the spark is arcing
&gt; &gt; in the cap? Distributor/condenser grounded poorly? Any other ideas?
