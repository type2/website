&gt; &lt;&lt; The rear edge is curved to

&gt; 
&gt; There are a couple of profile reproducers available: One is a box section of
&gt; plastic or metal with about fifty metal sliding pins, mounted at a right angle
&gt; to the box. By pressing the pins against an object, a profile is created in 
&gt; the
&gt; leading edge of the pins. Another type is a plastic covered flexible bar; it 
&gt; is
&gt; stiff enough to retain the profile after being pressed against an object. Both
&gt; should be available from a decent woodworker's catalog or store. Rockler's
&gt; is one, but I'm sure there are others.

thisee might be useful, but the exact shape isn't that critical.  I just
cut the Naugahyde for the inside of the tray a bit long and let it lap up
onto the air duct.  this covers the small gap at the back of the tray.
