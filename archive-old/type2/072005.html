Subject: WTB Westy in Pac. NW

I've got a friend who's looking for a later model Westy (76-79)

He's here in Vancouver, B.C.; would prefer a Canadian machine, but will
look as far as Washington, maybe into Oregon.

Any sellers?  Reply backchannel to me; he's not on e-mail, so I'll forward
replies.

Thanks,

Roger
