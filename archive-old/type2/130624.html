Subject: Re: [T2] won't idle after warmed up

I have a '74 bus with the 1800 dual carb engine.  It has been running great
until recently.  Now, after the engine is warm, it wants to stall at idle,
and won't restart easily after stalling, sometimes requires a cool down
period before it will start.  This also seems to be getting progressively
worse.  I have a bit of repair/maintenance experience from owning a '69 1600
bus for several years, but haven't done much work on the '74 yet. A search
of the type2 database showed several folks with idle problems while cool,
but not much about after-warmup problems.  Any help will be appreciated.

Also, can anyone tell me what kind of gas mileage I should be getting?  I
only get about 12-15 per gallon and that seems low to me. &gt;&gt;

First guess sounds like a stuck choke...
