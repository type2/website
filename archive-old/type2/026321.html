&gt; &gt; I just recently purchased a '77 bus with a 2.0liter fuel injection.  The
&gt; bus
&gt; &gt; had been sitting for 3 months.  Anyway the bus was in good physical
&gt; shape
&gt; &gt; and the price was good.  I am wondering what things I need to check
&gt; before I
&gt; &gt; even begin to try to start this motor up?  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; two words... FUEL LINES!
&gt; 
&gt; i found that one out the hard way, it was a small fire but i dont want
&gt; to repeat it

	VERY GOOD POINT!! However don't check them by squeezing them, as
this can crack them causing 
	a big fire. 
	I would look at them, and unless they smell of gas, or look wet I'd
still go ahead and
	try the initial start. HOWEVER if they look sad, then I would put
repalcing them 
	very high on the list of thing to replace, probably on the top of
that list, and might
	even consider replacing them immediatley after the initial startup.
Yuo may want a helper
	watching those lines during the initial gas, and if gas is squirting
out STOP!
