Subject: Re: [T2] Fluid Vendor

&gt;Dear All:
&gt;
&gt;  I can't find anyone locally with GL 4 tranny lube and couldn't find
&gt;anything on the web that sold Redline (which appeared to be the list
&gt;recommendation)  Bus Depot doesn't have any listed in their web catalog,
&gt;Vintage Bus Archive didn't show a vendor, NAPA no...
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have a name and number to call?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks and have a great Memorial Day weekend!
&gt;
&gt;- Brian

Check out Pegasus auto racing. I've purchased redline products from 
them on two occasions. Quick and friendly, and they've got an online 
ordering system that seems to work okay.
