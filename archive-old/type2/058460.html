Subject: Re: Question:  Case Adapter Question

&gt;I currently have a 71 bus with a Type 1 case that has an adapter mounted
&gt;on the oil pump to allow it to mount to the rear hanger for my 71 Type
&gt;2.  I purchased the bus this way and I am having no problems with this
&gt;setup at the moment.  My question is if I should leave this setup alone
&gt;or if I should drill and tap the case to accept the rear hanger for the
&gt;71 Type 2.  Does anybody have any long-term experience with this
&gt;adapter?

I've used the adapter for several years with no problem (was there when I
bought the bus), so I think they work okay.  However, I would like to go
to a full flow setup with cooler and filter so I'm thinking of drilling the
case.  Does anybody have experience with THAT?  Is there some kind of template
or jig, or would it be obvious where to drill once you have the rear hanger
out of the way?
