&gt; Do you use the pop-top? Is it worth the extra top-heaviness when used

I love the pop-top on my Westy.  I don't think I could do without it.

The early bay Westies (with the luggage rack in the rear) I believe 
used a standard sunroof opening (they had a smaller sleeping area up 
top ... just a folding cot).  I believe the later bay Westies (luggage 
rack in front) have a different hole cut-out in the roof, with a 
reinforcing bar running across above the rear folding seat to provide 
stiffness.
