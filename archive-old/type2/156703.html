Subject: Re: [T2] funny sign

Speaking of Fridays, I had a good run in the Bopmobile yesterday.   Had to drive up to a recording studio for a session.  Gotta love  Fridays.  Only day of the week I get to run in the fast  lane.  OK, crawl in the fast lane.  Nah, I had a pretty good  run.  She really feels really good on those new Hancooks.  If  she keeps running this good (thank you, 009!) I'm going to have to  enter her in that NASCAR Bus Series I keep hearing about. :)  Have  a great weekend everybody....KR
