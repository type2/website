Subject: Clutch Slipping

My 71 Westy's clutch seems correctly adjusted according to what the =
Idiot book and Bentley says.  However in 3rd and 4th the clutch slips =
under hard acceleration.  I'm guessing that this means its time to =
replace the clutch, but I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do =
to extend the life a few weeks.  I've already stuck a few washers in the =
Bowden tube, and while theres now still some threads left on the clutch =
cable, I can't seem to get things any tighter.  Should I loosen things =
up a little to take pressure off the clutch? Or do I need to tighten =
things even more?

Hal
