Last week I wrote about the &quot;drive your VW to work disaster'. My '78 started
to make a load knocking noise just before I arrived at work. It was still
running but sounded horrible, like it was trying to drive the pistons thru
the heads at full speed in stead of reversing direction at top dead center.
So I parked the car and left it. On wednesday I went to collect the car. I
was planning to tow it home so I took one of my sons along as the extra
driver. Just to let him know what the problem was I started the engine. As
you might expect it was still sounding horrible. Then I revved it up a bit
in order to position the bus behind the Vanagon which was going to be the
tow car. And then a miracle occured. The noise went away! It sounded quite
normal. As driving is a lot easier than towing we decided to drive carefully
planning to stop when the noise would come back. As a matter of fact it ran
perfectly alright and we made it home without any further incidents. So now
it is sitting in front of my apartment, waiting for me to decide what to do
about it. Any idea's?
