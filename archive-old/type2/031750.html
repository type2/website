Subject: Re: [T2] also under my dash...

&gt; Also while I was under my dash I located some soft and hard plubming bits 
&gt; and what appears to be a refrigerant thermostat behind the passenger side 
&gt; kick panel.  The plubming goes back to the driver side of the engine 
&gt; compartment, under the floor.  Since I don't have the original engine and 
&gt; there's no vents or control box anywhere to be found, is there a build sheet 
&gt; or something that could tell me what these parts might have been for?  The 

air conditioner &quot;stuff&quot;
