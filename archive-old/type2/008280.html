Hi Volks,

Diane &amp; Dave Burden wrote to the List:
&gt; We're contemplating converting our new '72 Bus into a camper.  

At the risk of being a nuisance I say don't.  I've seen many a
retrofit camper and still can't get used to them.  Please don't
sacrifice more original non-campers, they're rare enough as is.  :-(

&gt; line on a '75 Westy that we can part out.  Installing the interior
should
&gt; not be that difficult, but what about the pop top?  I obviously will
have
&gt; to hack out a gaping hole in the roof of our '72, but are there any
&gt; reinforcements needed?  Did they reinforce the bodies or frames at
all when
&gt; making the Westies?

While not an expert on Westies, I believe they did.  The gaping hole
for the '73 and later pop top goes all the way from behind the front
doors to above the rear hatch; there's a sturdy piece of &quot;frame&quot; there
in Buses and Panel Vans (and pre-'73 Westies).  I am sure that they
had to compensate somehow; I don't know how though.

&gt; I'm also assuming that a '75 pop top (hinge in the back) will fit a
'72
&gt; Bus, which would have had a front hinging top.  Is that correct?

Apart from the reinforcements matter, it would fit.  They never
changed anything about size or shape of the roof throughout the Loaf
era (discounting the post-'91 Mexican and Brazilian models for a
minute).

&gt; Has anyone out there done this sort of conversion before?  Any tips or
&gt; suggestions?

As I said, please don't do it.  Sell the Bus you have, and get one
that's already been hacked into a camper, if the money won't stretch
for a real Westy. Dunno about the U.S., but original Buses have
already become awfully rare here -- as rare as original Panel Vans. 
Hacked campers OTOH are a dime a dozen.

No offence meant, though.  No really.

Oh and BTW: there'll be a VW Bus meeting and campout on the 2nd
weekend of April, at the VW Bus Museum in Salzgitter, Germany.  Those
of the interested who can read German may visit
http://www.bulli_dot_org/museum/, those who cannot please kick me to get
the translation done.  ;-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.

&quot;You mean there's such a thing as a VW Bus with rear side windows?&quot;
