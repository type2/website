Subject: Re: [Serious Help Request]

Rick,
Is the smoke coming out of the end of the exhaust pipe?
If so, my theory is a broken ring or piston. Does it lack power?  The smoke is
blue/white right?  If so, oil (lots of it) is getting into a cumbustion
chamber and its probably NOT coming in through the valvetrain.

I don't think this is head or valve related because if it were, the cylinder
in question would probably cease to fire - no smoke at all or very little
coupled with a significant loss of power and rough running - but all the time
- not just after it warmed up.

If the smoke is not coming from the exhaust pipe, you've sprung a serious leak
somewhere - a hole in a pushrod tube (or case-side seal) leaking oil onto a
hot exhaust?  The fact that it happens only after she warms up points more to
an oil leak, hopefully.

Hope not (i could be wrong and quite frequently am ;-), but my gut feeling is
you're looking at at least a partial top-end rebuild. Depends on your
mechanic...$150-500+?

good luck and keep us posted if u can - you are not the only one who doesn't
know what happened or (most importantly) why - your findings will be important
to the list.

thanks and good luck,

clark gordon

&gt; HELP!
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 72 Type II that has run great for several years.   A few days
&gt; ago my son told me he had trouble getting home and  the van was making
&gt; HUGE clouds of smoke.   Today, I drove it and it ran a little rough but I
&gt; saw no smoke until it got warm, suddenly I was making such a cloud of
&gt; smoke that the people behind me had to turn on their headlights!!!
&gt; 
&gt; It only made the smoke while the engine was under load.  With the clutch
&gt; pushed in, no smoke.
&gt; 

&gt; Rick
