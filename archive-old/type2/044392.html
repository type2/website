Subject: [T2] re: rear deck lid

Volks,

This reminds me strangely of a &quot;discussion&quot; that occured a few years ago
on this list... there was a vociferous debate that sprang up as to whether
the bellows on a thermostat module opened or closed as it got hot.  The
definitive answer was finally provided when Ken Hooper cut a new one open
and watched it expand.

There are some debates that can only be ended with actual empirical
evidence.  This appears to one of them.  George Lyle has volunteered to
provide that evidence in a week or two by hooking a manometer into the
engine compartment and measuring the pressure.  

It seems to me that further discussion on a theoretic basis is fairly
non-informative.  I think that it would be far more productive to await
George's test.  OK?

BTW, for those who (a) can't wait, (b) have a '73-79 bus, and (c) have a
friend; you can beat the rush to the answer:

Remove the rear cushion/pad from over the engine.
Station a friend in the back seat.
Drive the bus onto a convenient freeway.
Have your friend unlatch the engine hatch and attempt to remove it.

If the hatch springs right up when it is unlatched, then the air pressure
in the engine compartment is positive.  If it does not, and tugging at it
will not raise it, then the air pressure is negative.

Two warnings:
First, I don't know the answer, I'm just proposing the test.  That hatch
is a couple square feet and if the air pressure is strongly positive, it
is going to spring up quite forcefully!  Be careful!!!
Second, the engine is noisier than you think!  Do not be shocked at how
loud it sounds with the cover off :-)
