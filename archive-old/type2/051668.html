Subject: [T2] Support your local FLAPS

Since it's Friday, I thought I'd vent on supporting local stores.
Last week I burst a water hose on my wife's Vol^o, losing water I made it to
where for the last 40 years there was a FLAPS they had shut down! I filled
the car with water from another store (pet shop!) &amp; limped to another FLAPS
they too have closed down both within the last 2 months! As I limped down
the road I found why; a HUGE car part/accessories super store, did they have
my hose? No, but they could order it in, in 10 days! Both of the other store
would have had the part I needed.
Here in the UK, DIY Superstores, Food Supermarkets, mail order &amp; the
internet have just about killed all the smaller outlets. You might pay a
little more locally, but when you NEED a left handed thingamybob, that mail
order shed is 2 days delivery away &amp; even then they don't stock it! Most of
these outfits are only interested in what sells in quantity.
I think the cost is even, 1 item to send back &amp; gone is the saving or
unnoticed damage after you signed for the package - DOH!
In the end a big DIY store wants to sell 10 6&quot; wood screws in a nice plastic
non bio-degradable pack for £3, where as my local hardware store will sell
the 2 that I need for 50 pence &amp; they come in a brown paper bag! For the
sake of  pocket change use your local stores, it's good for your local
economy &amp; community. Just visit any area where most of the local stores have
closed down, the local area begins to degenerate as jobs are lost &amp; passing
trade in other store reduces. Just my rant (and all over a hose!).
