Subject: exhaust installation advice needed

I'am having a lot of trouble installing my exhaust system.
When I took out my engine I removed the whole thing as a
unit not as pieces. Any ways....I setup to jacks
on each heat exchanger and raised it up till it was close
to the exhaust ports. Me and my buddy were under the bus
on each side below the heat exchangers, and then tried
to lift it into position. Boy is that thing heavy!!!
No luck WHAT SO EVER! We could get one side onto the stud
just a bit and then we went to push the other side on
and it wont be lined up. Tried that a few times and
each time it wouldn't line up, always about a 1/4 of a inch
out of alignment. I tried getting one side on and
starting the nuts and then attempting to get the other
side in but didn't get any further because it would not
lined up. We tried to keep the exhaust system level
to the engine as much as we could, to help installing.
Everything is pretty rusted so separating it really
inst a option, unless I break something.
Were out of ideas, going to sleep on it tonight and see
what we think of.

o yeah engine and exhaust details might be good duh!
79' 2L engine , with 79' exhaust with cat

The engine is in the bus, I would have tried to install
the exhaust while the engine was out but with it on
the engine wouldn't slip under the bus :(

So if anyone has got any tips or tricks on getting
the exhaust system on could you send them my way.
Thanks in advance for anyone that replys with help.
