&gt; &gt;I have a question but I don't mean to start a flame war. ;-)  With all
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;supporters of fuel injection out there, how come no one has a fuel
&gt; injected
&gt; &gt;1600 in their bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Because all the supporters of fuel injection drive Type 4 engined Buses
&gt; that already have it :-)
&gt; I believe Scott Allred has an aftermarket FI system in his '71 Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; VW has had a number of fuel injected 1600s in the type 3
&gt; &gt;and later beetles.  It seems that with all the frustration out there
&gt; over the
&gt; &gt;34 PICT 3 carbs someone would have tried to transplant a FI system from
&gt; a
&gt; &gt;beetle or type 3.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an idea.  The FI system used on the '75 and later Beetles is the
&gt; same as used on our '75 and later Buses, Bosch L-Jetronic.  The system
&gt; used on the '67 and later Type 3s, though, is Bosch D-Jetronic, which
&gt; seems to have a reputation for being finicky.
&gt; 
&gt; I am highly tempted to take a fuel-injected Beetle engine and put it in
&gt; my '74 Karmann Ghia.  I would, however, need an FI gas tank (has an
&gt; outlet and a return inlet), I would need to run a fuel return line from
&gt; the engine to the gas tank, I would need to figure out how to rig up an

   My '73 westy has no FI tank, I just put in a &quot;T&quot; fitting ahead of the
filter and pump, and ran the pressure regulator outlet line to the T.
Works fine.

&gt; air cleaner.  I'd need to see what needs to be done with exhaust --
&gt; could I use the stock exhaust and heat exchangers or would I have to go
&gt; with those from the FI model years?  If the latter, will they work with

    I'm using an extractor exhaust, seems to work okay as well --
