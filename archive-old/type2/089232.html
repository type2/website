&gt; Sounds like the brake booster is going bad or you have
&gt; lost your vaccume to it. Phil

It does not matter if the booster is good or bad, or even if he does not have
a brake booster. A good master cylinder will hold pressure. One that leaks
down internally, bypassing the seals, will slowly drop. He needs a master
cylinder right NOW.
