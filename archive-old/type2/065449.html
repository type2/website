&gt;This has come up with me before.  It used to be that the boot kits &gt;had
&gt;a new washer.

The RMMW boot kits not only come with new washers, they also come
with new bolts!  All for $9.95!  Promptly delivered, reasonable,
german boot kits.  I was impressed!  I will definately get my next
mail-order stuff from RMMW.  Lifetime warranty, to boot!
