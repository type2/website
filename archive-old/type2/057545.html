&gt; Why don't you put the damn tin back on instead?! My bus has never gotten

Still, an extra oil cooler is a good idea. My engine is professionally
rebuild with all tin, seals etc.  in place. But it still runs around 120
Celsius (240 Farenheit) at 85 mph and 90 Farenheit outside temperature.
This is partly due to some tuning (296 cam, Porsche cyl + pistons, 38
Solex, and late model heads) but my stock engine got nearly as hot.
I believe an extra oil cooler will expand any #3 cylinder's life
expectancy. Make sure you always use high temperature oil (W50 or W60). I
use semi synthetic 15W50.
