&gt;Have you checked your motor mounts.  Sounds like the torque of the engine my
&gt;be creating a vibration.

&gt;&gt; Is this normal on hills, or possibly a bad thing?

My bid is for the motor mounts as well.
Thought of that about an hour ago,  top of the list
including valve train noises and rod knocks.
So, is expensive bad ? If the mounts aren't bad,
get an informed observer to point in another direction
before the problem becomes expensive.
