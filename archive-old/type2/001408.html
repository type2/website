&gt;Has anyone on this list ever taken a long distance trip in an automatic VW
bus?? How did it do on the mountains?? Did you have to shift to 2nd??
&gt;
Yes, I own a 78 auto bus. It did fine in the mountains. I never went in
serious mountians. The most severe was highway 12 over White Pass. Those
trannys are air cooled and I think a external cooler could help alot. A
couple of times I noticed the fluid looked a little burned so I changed it.
But I think that was mostly because of in town stop and go driving on a hot
day. -Moe 78 Auto Bus
