Subject: RE: [T2] Child's cot

I thought these weights where way off, but this is what the manual says,
unless it is in some other weight than pounds. I did not verify that. I will
have to look later. I don't use the childs cot at all, but until I broke the
upper cot it held a 150 pound person for several camping trips.

I think your limits are way off.  I think the limit for the fold out
cot is around 100 pounds.  The limit for the child's cot that goes
over the front seat is around 30 pounds.  I could be a bit on the
conservative side but not by much.  One of my kids who weighs about
135 has used the fold out cot, however, the canvas is in like new
condition.  Remember that these cots weaken over time.  The original
canvas for my fold out cot failed when a kid was playing around in
it.  This canvas had spent most of its life in New Mexico.

With the child's cot over the drivers seat, age is more important
than weight.  The attachments to the pillars are not that secure.  As
soon as the child awakes, he or she should be removed from the cot. 
If the child starts to move around, one of the poles will slip out
and &quot;down will come baby, cradle and all.&quot;  I speak from experience
here.  Also, don't store any hard or sharp objects on the seats or
floor when the baby is in the cot.

&gt;I think my manual says 90 pounds for the childs cot and 150 for the 
&gt;upper
&gt;cot. Although I would not put a 90 pound child in the child cot, 
&gt;doesn't
&gt;look that strong. I also fell through the upper cot. I am about 170, 
&gt;so I
&gt;pushed that old canvas to far.

&gt;
&gt;Does anyone out there know what the suggested weight limit is for 
&gt;the 
&gt;child's cot that goes over the front seats? I know that common sense 
&gt;will 
&gt;probably be the answer, but I'm just wondering how long people have 
&gt;been 
&gt;known to succesfully let the little ones sleep up there. My little 
&gt;guy is 
&gt;only 9 months old now so I'm pretty sure I've got some time.
&gt;
&gt;Mostly asking b/c my wife recently saw me fall through the cot 
&gt;up-top while 
&gt;showing that it can hold me. Guess that's another one I lost...
&gt;
&gt;BTW - does anyone have a cot in decent shape for a 72 that they are 
&gt;willing 
&gt;to let go of? If so, please contact me off the list.
