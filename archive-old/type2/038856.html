That depends....is it from a Gewurtstraminer wine?? Or
possibly something else from the Rhine valley? If so,
you have the rarest-of-rare...the &quot;Euro-only Limited
Edition Wino-Westy&quot;!!!

If it's an Ernest&amp;Julio, on the other hand...you're
simply driving the more common &quot;Cheap-Drunk Wagen&quot;;
which so many of us continually fall off of;-)

Now...if, in fact, it is not truly a wooden wine
crate, but a cardboard wine-in-the-box, I'll recommend
your immediate expulsion from this list...BLASPHEME!


Now, if you wanted something a bit more authentic (the
Germans are known for their beer, after all), get a
good import beer-tap handle for your shift knob!
Paulaner, perhaps?? Maybe even Hofbrau-Haus???
