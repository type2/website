Ideas: *a dime a dozen*

Did you check/replace the seals around the engine, and the engine
compartment lid?

Tire pressure? * I run 35 psi front &amp; 40 psi rear*
H30/31 PICT carb- Could you possibly be running a little lean?
20/50 oil? *I run 40 wt.*

I usually run at between 190 and 210 under 60 mph on the fwy except for a
trip recently *at night* from San Diego to Indio Calif.  The outside temp
was 105 degrees. Had to stop, and let it cool off, a couple of times until I
could get back to the cool in San Diego.....

&gt; Here's the set-up:
&gt; New 1600 longblock from VW of Mexico.
&gt; New heater boxes from Bus Depot.
&gt; New stock exhaust from Bus Depot.
&gt; New Solex H30/31 PICT carb.
&gt; Oil-bath air cleaner.
&gt; New intake manifold.
&gt; Mechanical advance distributor.
&gt; Petronix Ignitor ignition.
&gt; New Blue coil
&gt; New generator.
&gt; Rebuilt stock fuel pump.
&gt; Engine tin stripped and freshly painted.
&gt; New Yokohama 356's with 32 PSI.
&gt; New plastic hoses from shroud to heater boxes. (Gene Berg)
&gt; New dipstick temp. sensor. (Gene Berg)
&gt; 91 octane fuel.
&gt; At 350 miles I changed the oil (20W 50), adjusted the valves, adjusted the
&gt; idle with tach/dwell meter to 900 RPM. Timed engine to 0 gerees TDC. Tuned
&gt; the carb per Barb and Eric.
&gt; My problem is that when I get on the highway for 15 minutes or more, my
oil
&gt; light comes on telling me I have reached 220 degrees.
&gt; The light will go off if I get off the highway and drive in stop and go
&gt; traffic under 45 MPH. I have exhausted everything I can think of, checked
&gt; and rechecked, and I am still running hot, even though it's a cool 74
&gt; degrees outside.
&gt; What is a good operating temperature for a 1600? I'm not for sure, but I
&gt; figure I am probably hitting 225 to 230 degrees. 230 is the temperature
&gt; where all sorts of bad things are supposed to start happening (per Gene
&gt; Berg).
&gt; Am I missing anything here? If I don't figure this thing out soon, I'm
&gt; dropped it off at the local VW mechanic. I would just really like to
figure
&gt; this out, and fix it myself. any ideas?
&gt; Thanks,
