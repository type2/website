Subject: [T2] [VB] archives hysteria

I think certain people need to learn a lesson in tact and
chain of command...

Any time you go around your boss or immediate superior
you should expect to be handed your walking papers.

Whether anyone likes it or not, Hooper owns Type2_dot_com. He
is very protective of the content and access and we are
all the better for it.

Whether anyone likes it or not, Type2_dot_com is better run as
a dictatorship than like a democracy.  A democracy is nice
until you try to get a group to make decisions or get
things done in a timely manner.

Before you go spouting off wait &amp; see what Hooper has
planned.  Chances are we will end up with an archive with
a better design that is easier to navigate &amp; get useful
information from (no offense).

Anyone having withdrawal from being without a bus list for
a week really should look for something else to enrich
their life.
