 &gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I was out nosing around the WEB (imagine that:-) and
&gt; thought to take a look at what kit plane owners might
&gt; use to heat themselves.  I happened across this link
&gt; and was wondering if anyone else had had any
&gt; experience with this sort of thing:

&gt; 
&gt; Thinking outside the box,
