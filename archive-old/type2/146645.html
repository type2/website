Subject: Re: [T2] vacume check on distributor

&gt; I set the timing to 7.5 BTDC on my 1974 bus and pulled
&gt; the vacume hose of the flat part of the distrubiutor
&gt; (retard hose).  It made no difference to my advance or
&gt; idle.  I also noticed that the hose does have a

It won't do anything at idle as it's not supposed to.

&gt; considerable amount of suction when i put my finger
&gt; over it.  How do i check the disributor vacume system?

There is not supposed to be any suction at idle, you might have the 
wrong hose hooked up.  The advance hose is supposed to hook up to your 
throttle body, not your manifold.

&gt; Also does anyone know where to find a clear vacume
&gt; hose diagram for 1974 bus.

granted, I could be totally wrong because yours is a 74 and mine is a 
78, but I'll stick with my story for now ;)


&gt; Also I have a new 0 231 178 009 distributor with an
&gt; electronic iginition in it instead of points.  Will
&gt; this work with the 1974 bus?  A friend gave it to me
&gt; one day.

I think that's a subjective question ;)

Mike
