&gt;5&quot;x8&quot;) being entirely adequate even for Alaska, but this MUST be a
&gt;different scale or measurement than, for example, a 1500W hair dryer
&gt;(which I doubt would do much to heat my bus).

IF this puts out the same heat as an electric heater of the same wattage
rating, it sure would heat the bus up well. We use an electric cube
ceramic heater, rated at 1500 watts. Heats up our '81 Campmobile to a
toasty warm temperature in about 5 minutes. But a propane heater would
be even better. No need to worry about shore power.
