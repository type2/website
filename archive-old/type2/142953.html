Subject: Yet Another Clutch Cable

WTF? I just did the clutch cable about 6 months ago and I just had it
break again tonight.

But it wasn't the cable itself. The front end that is shaped like a U
with the holes that the clevis pin attaches to snapped. The holes
elongated then broke. The clevis pin was in pieces in the frame,
probably from the sudden snap of the cable under tension.

Everything was well lubed still.

I mickey-moused (maybe a shark-fix is going to be my new term for all
my hack jobs) it back together. I used a pair of pliers to get the
ends back into something like a circle, then took a bolt and cranked
it on. Then, knowing the thing wouldn't hold on its own, I used some
ceiling wire that I happened to have (that stuff is awesome! Solid
wire, bends nicely and holds its bends) and wrapped it around the bolt
and around the cable itself where it goes into the U shaped thing.

I know the wire won't hold the clutch by itself, but I figured it
would relieve some of the tension on the U as well as keep it from
snapping back into the frame somewhere I can't get to it.

I have a new cable somewhere, but no clevis pin. :(   I'll put the new
cable in tomorrow with a fresh bolt and lots of washers and grease and
hope it holds for a while until I get another clevis pin (actually, 2
so I have a spare along with ANOTHER spare cable.)

Anybody seen an end bust like that?
