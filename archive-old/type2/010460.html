If your bus won't start only when it (the bus) is hot, you need a HOT START
RELAY. Go to http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/relay.htm. It is a really simple
and cheap install. I did it myself and didn't even chip my nail polish. And
it works. I live in Tucson and the bus is always running on the warm side.
Heck, the ambient temperature is always on the warm side. The price we pay
for no rust.
