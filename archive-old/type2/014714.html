I would change the oil twice once you fix the problem.  I had gas in
the oil due to a bad fuel pump(upright engine).  After I fixed the
problem and changed the oil I noticed that the oil pressure at idle
was lower than usual.  I changed the oil again and the idle pressure
returned to normal.  Apparently, a small amount of gas can
significantly cut the viscosity of the oil.


&gt;Hi,
&gt;    I have a 78 transporter. Smile, warm fuzzy feeling enters stage 
&gt;left.
&gt;Last week while driving on a short trip, read 40 miles of two lane 
&gt;highway,
&gt;my oil light began to flicker and power began to *disappear*.  I 
&gt;pulled over
&gt;to check my oil, cool down, and have a coke when I discovered that 
&gt;my oil
&gt;wasn't lower than when I started my journey but higher!!!!  Hmmm. 
&gt;The oil,
&gt;in my opinion, had gas mixed in somehow.  I nursed the bus home and 
&gt;drained
&gt;the oil.  So, with new oil and filter, I tried the drive again
&gt;yesterday......  Same thing happens, power loss, oil light begins to
&gt;flicker.  Are my rings shot?? Should I plan on new jugs and plugs?  
&gt;Would
&gt;gasoline thinned oil cause damage to the 78 heads?  My baby is 
&gt;staying
&gt;parked until I can get this little thing fixed.  But we should be in 
&gt;prime
&gt;condition for the drive down to Eureka Springs, Ark in August. TIA
