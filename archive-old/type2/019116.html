Gentlefolk:

I am still in the process of finding a replacement front axle beam for
Brunhilda, my '73 Westie.  I have got a couple of leads on a used axle,
but it would help to know if axle beams from other earlier/later years
will fit.  Anyone know?

Regards,

Don Kaag
(...and Brunhilda II, the Westie Wonderbus...)
