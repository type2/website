&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; Ok, I've read the archive, but still!
&gt;
&gt; I was told that today's batteries (12V) need higher voltage to be kept
&gt; full and our older regulator doesn't do the job properly as to keep
&gt; those new batteries full????

I don't believe this.  Unless they've changed the chemical properties of
lead and sulfuric acid the voltages can't have changed.  I run a &quot;modern&quot;
battery on my '71 and it charged up with the old generator and with the
newer alternator.

&gt; Ok, so am gonna find a older style battery like I have on mine right now
&gt; (it as a vent/breather on 1 side and it's about 4 years old-99 on it),
&gt; so I went to my local part store and the guy told me that he don't know
&gt; what am talking about and my current battery is a standard battery with
&gt; a &quot;vent&quot;..... Ggggrrrrr....

Go to Pep Boys (or whatever FLAPS is handy), ask for a group 24 battery
with a 75 month warranty.  It's not the &quot;specified in the book&quot; battery
(seems all VWs originally used the bug-size battery) but it fits well and
has a bit more capacity.

Don't go for the &quot;maintainance free&quot; batteries, as they are really just
&quot;you can't maintain it, so buy another one&quot; batteries.  If you can't
remove the caps, you don't want it.

I avoid Sears batteries because of a blatant warranty scam they pulled on
me a few years back.

Pep Boys have always done well by me, even to the point of giving me a
pro-rate on a core that I didn't think had any time left on it.  The
clerk read the date code and gave me $10 off the new battery!
