Subject: timing clarification

using a timing light, you will connect it to the coil.  you should then 
make sure you are tdc.  you will then begin to static time the engine 
according to the year of the engine specs.  to see if it is timed 
correctly, you should move the crank counterclockwise about 3 inches 
past proper tick mark in crank, then clockwise.  Using a 67 bug for 
example, if engine is timed correctly, then timing light will go on at 
7.5.  if it does not, (you are at tdc still) then move crank to 7.5 and 
loosen dist clamp.  you then will rotate dist clockwise until light goes 
off then rotate dist counter until light just comes on.  to check timing 
you can again do the rotating crankshaft.  if the timing light goes on 
when the crank is at 7.5 you are ok.
