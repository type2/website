Hi Folks,

I figured I'd add my 2 cents to this thread.  I have a 1979 Westy with a 
single battery, and was considering adding a second one, but the cost and 
engineering have kept me away from it.

My current solution involves a device called a Booster-Pac.  The Booster-Pac 
is a self-contained battery with clamps for jumpstarting, a 12V outlet for 
accessories, and a charge meter.  If my Bus battery dies, I can jumpstart 
myself from the Pac, and I can run 12V accessories off of it.  When the Pac 
dies, I can plug it into the cigarette lighter to charge it, or can plug it 
into a wall outlet.  It's pretty compact, and only cost about 50 bucks.  For 
now, it's a pretty good solution for me.

Your Mileage May Vary,

Jason Upper
