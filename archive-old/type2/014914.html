&gt;The same thing was happening on my engine, Dave Easterwood can vouch for
&gt;this, it caused TWO catastrophic meltdowns.
&gt;
&gt;Moral:  Let someone who REALLY knows how to align-bore do the work.  

Blake used a machinist in Knoxville that should have his micrometers 
taken away from him.

The rods he had &quot;rebuilt&quot; I suspect he only honed the brass bushings.  
You could rock a wrist pin very noticeably in the bushings.  The crankshaft 
that the machinist said was ok had bad wear on the pulley end bearing 
journal.  It was dished from having the generator belt too tight, I guess.

Blake had rebuilt the engine and it locked up within about 30 seconds.  

I tore it down &amp; examined it &amp; there were metal shavings EVERYWHERE.  
Blake had paid the guy for an align bore &amp; cleaning the case, but the 
machinist must have cleaned the case before the align bore and not after.  
I noticed there was a strange wear pattern on the main thrust bearing at 
the flywheel end and mentioned it to Blake.  There was wear on the top &amp; 
bottom of the bearing.  I thought it was all the trash in the oil that 
locked it up, so I went ahead &amp; pressure washed the case &amp; rebuilt it for 
him with a reground crank, rebushed rods &amp; all new bearings.

So Blake puts the engine back in his bus and drives it for about a 
thousand miles before it locks up again.

I tear it down again and find that it locked up at the main thrust bearing 
at the flywheel end again.  Same wear pattern on top &amp; bottom of the 
bearing.

So I go over to my machinist and we proceed to align bore it at .020 
(which Blake's machinist in Knoxville was supposed to do).  The cutters 
barely made scratches on one side of the case, but they took off good 
amounts of metal on the top, bottom, and other side of the case.

I put it back together with another reground crank and all new bearings.  
Blake has been driving it for a few months now and I hope it will be at 
least 5 years before he tells me it has locked up again (knock on wood).

Basically, Blake had to have 2 extra rebuilds because he got a sloppy 
align bore because his machinist did not have his cutter height set 
correctly or did not really know what he was doing.

A bad $45 align bore almost made Blake give up on VWs.

If you have to get engine parts machined, make sure the work is done by 
a reputable machine shop with a lot of Volkswagen experience.
