Hmm, separators, isolators, and spare alternator.......here's a 4th
option-  I hooked 2 high capacity starting batteries together in
parallel and keep a voltmeter on both-used a large wire connecting both
positives, so you have double the time for use before reaching 11.9
volts.  My electric fridge (the biggest drainer) has a Whistler cutout
switch (avail. at a FLAPS) set to this voltage; it would be easy to put
in a warning buzzer to go off when this cuts out to let you know when
it's time to run the bus.  The advantage there is for weekend trippers
who never run the Bus enough after their trip to charge the deep cycle
battery which needs more time than the starting battery.  The voltmeter
lets you know if you've driven enough to charge the batts (2.2 resting
volts per cell); if not, put them on an external charger. MB 78 Westy
