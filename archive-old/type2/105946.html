Subject: Re: [T2] wiring help???

----- Original Message -----
From: &quot;Tom and Thanh&quot;
&gt; Did your bus have two bulbs before??

Yes the Single cab &quot;originally&quot; (at least they came with the SC when I got
her) had a two bulb system with 4 wires coming off.  I switched to a 1 bulb
housing with 2 wires.  At best, all I have ever had is brake lights work
before, wiring was really bad and terminals corroded so I thought I would
just start fresh.  :)

But as of now I have taillights and no turn signals, brake lights or
flashers  :(

Peace,
Snoopy
