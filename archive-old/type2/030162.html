&gt; Quoth G.L. &quot;That's why you set (ponts) by dwell, not gap.  Dwell tells
&gt; you what the coil is
&gt; seeing, gap is just there to get the engine started.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The only useful thing I remember from perusing Muir is &quot;Timing is when
&gt; the match is lit; dwell is how long it it lit&quot;...ie, 50 degrees means 50
&gt; degrees of crank rotation.  Can you really controll the duration of the
&gt; high voltage current by how long the points are closed?  Could't you
&gt; then stick a voltmeter(continuity)  or static light across the points
&gt; and determing 50 degrees by how far the rotor moves before opening the
&gt; curcuit (distr. out of the bus)?  If the dist. is in the bus, it's the
&gt; crank you could mark for 50 degrees, but then the dwell meter is
&gt; easier.  MB

Well, Muir was being a bit poetic about it!  Basically, the rule on dwell
is that the points have to be closed long enough to build up a full
magnetic field in the coil.  The duration of the spark is determined by
how quickly the magnetic field collapses, not by the time that the points
are open.  Of course, if the time the points are open is less than the
duration of the spark (not likely) this would limit duration.

The time consumer here is the building up of the field.  If you have
insufficient dwell, the field will never reach full strength so the spark
will be weak.  There's really a wide range of dwell that will work and the
dwell spec is to ensure that the setting is in the middle of the useable
range.
