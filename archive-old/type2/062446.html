I think it would be a better idea to just get the correct sender.

I can tell you that on a type IV motor the dipstick sender and the sump
mounted sender both get their readings from the *exact* same (less than
ideal) place.  One will *not* give you a more accurate reading than the
other.

I like the sump plate sender because it doesn't interfere with the dipstick
and you won't have another wire hanging around in your engine compartment.
