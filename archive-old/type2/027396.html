Hi.

I want to get a set of 'yellow' curtains.

I have the front curtain and the slider curtain.  I need the other four 
windows (8 curtains)

I can trade a FULL set of GREEN curtains, including the front and the 
slider.

I also have a front brown plad curtain from a '72.  Goos for someone who 
wants to go 'original' in the '72 family.


(I want to put all these curtains on the '72 I am putting back on the road.)

Many thanks.
