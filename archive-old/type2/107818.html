Subject: Re: [T2] I don't know anything, and here's proof

I forgot to mention, it's not leaking anymore. It dripped for a half hour or
so where the oil collected, but there's not a bunch of oil still coming out
anymore.

&gt; clean it all up
&gt; fill it with oil and see if you can ID the leak location first.
