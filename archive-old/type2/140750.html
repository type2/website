Subject: Re: [T2] paint code

Greg asked:

I'm new in this mailing list and need your help about a paint code.
I have a westy (1979) which is going to be repaint. As the decision of
the color is very important I would like to be sure that the result
will be the one expected.
 
 I will certainly choose the tuquoise color (L380) and the atlas white
on top if you confirm me that the color of the split on the
picture www.anyvintage_dot_com/ images/Ebaystuff/67bus1.JPG ,
is the turquoise L380 :

I did not look at your link because it has a problem and I know turquoise was never offered in 67.

Here are the 67 bus colors: http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/colors/bus67.htm

L380 Turquoise was offered on buses from 61 to 64:

For 1979 Westies, in the USA, only 2 colors were offered:
Sage Green for the P-22 model
Mexico Beige for the P-27 deluxe model.
