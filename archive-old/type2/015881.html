Subject: Hydraulic lifters/ To bleed or not to bleed???
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990520201002.00793b00_at_iu_dot_net&gt;

Some of you may recall my original post about oil temperature, followed by
oil leaks and finally tappets. It seems all are related to a lifter
replacement in 97. 
I removed the hydraulic lifters and found 4 out of 5 to contain Air (spongy). 
My question is, my mechanic friend told me (two years ago when he installed
new lifters) that the lifters do not require bleeding, that they pump up by
themselves. Everything I have read states that they must have the bleeding
process if there is spongyness. Is it possible that I have had air all this
time (two years*) and that was causing the clatter which in turn caused the
worn tappets?
It seems he also installed the manifold with Rtv silicone(red) which burned
out causing a manifold leak which was probably the source of my hot engine
temperatures. I didnt realize they were leaking as I have a cracked cross
over pipe which I thought was the only leak. I have purchased a new exhaust
,complete, also new lifters and tube seals. Hoping for the best! and with
fingers crossed. ( the cam seems to look ok, but have not checked the lift
yet)
* camper, not a daily driver, but over 10,000 since the lifter saga began.
