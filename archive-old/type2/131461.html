Subject: Urgent -- Busers stuck in Phoenix ... need Vanagon engine

Volks,

My friends Pete and Diane are hung up in Phoenix at the end of what's been a 
nightmare trip to Baja. Their '84 Vanagon engine let go of a rod in northern 
Mexico and they were able to get an old engine installed and continue on. 
Now they're at a shop in Phoenix (German Auto Repair) and the chief 
mechanic, who pulled their engine because the head gaskets were leaking, 
said it's not a keeper ... apparently the block passages are rusted to the 
point of the block being almost gone. They are in dire straits, and looking 
at ditching the Westy and flying home to Colorado.

If anyone in the area knows of a good running waterboxer engine that can be 
bought, please let them know. Pete's cell phone is (970) 618-0465. It's 
Friday and they'll likely stay the weekend in Phoenix while all this is 
decided, so don't hestitate to call if you have a lead on an engine. You can 
also email me.

Alternatively, if anyone would like to pick up a full-kit Westy this 
weekend, together with the sketchy engine (which ran and had 120-120-130-135 
compression when it was pulled yesterday, albeit with that aforementioned 
serious rust problem), call the same number. I have driven the van in 
question and it is solid, but they have had so much engine trouble that 
their Volkswagen days may be over.

If anyone can forward this to the Vanagon list, please do.

Thank you, thank you, thank you,

Mick McQuilton
