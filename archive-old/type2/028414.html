Jess,
	 Now watch the email come. I have done it and it makes quite a difference
to both temp and particularly noise. The problem is: if it gets wet, then it
holds water against the panels and your van goes rusty. People use it in
conjunction with tar style of stuff on the inside of the panels to stop
this. I used house insulation split into 1/2 thickness and it all went fine.

&gt; Juat thought it might be a good idea to keep it cooler when going
&gt; into more
&gt; tropical areas like North Queensland
