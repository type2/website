Subject: RE: [T2] Dim Alternator Light With Headlights On 

Hey, Rick, thanks for the hint...

I have a new, main battery, but my deep cycle battery looks to be some 20 
years old (vehicle was in storage since 1989)

Maybe the deep cycle battery is trying to gain a charge with the engine 
running, but it might be really dry, and with the extra drain because of the 
headlights, I might be drawing more than my generator is able to push out.

Doses that seem possible/likely??  I hope it is that simple....
