Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

Hello Guys     I see a couple of problems  the tin behind the fan housing is 
a bug one, doesn't seal at the corners, the fanhousing is the cheap ass 
taiwain junk which doesn;t cool as well . the fan is on a remote oil cooler which 
could be alright. I would bet that there are no flaps in the fanhousing also  .  
  I would personally change the fan housing back to stock and use the 
doghouse ones with the regular oil cooler and the remote cooler   later and have fun
