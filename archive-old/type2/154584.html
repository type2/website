Subject: Problems running after over-wintering

Hi Folks,

I don't drive my bus much in the winter, but I try to start it and drive it
once a month or so.  I went out yesterday to start it, and it gave me problems
that seem simple enough but that I haven't been able to solve.  I could use
some advice.  This is a '70 bus with a fresh Mexi DP engine.

First, I had trouble starting it.  Normally, this bus starts like a champ, but
this time I had to crank it and crank it and coax it.  Eventually, I got it
running, but it didn't run well.  It backfired and coughed and sputtered.
Finally, all four cylinders were firing, and once it warmed up for a good long
time, it idled reasonably well.  Whenever I gave it some gas, however, it
hesitated and then wanted to die.  By coaxing it slowly, I could get full
RPMs, but with any load at all on the bus it would run out of power and die.

Today I checked the valve clearances, which were fine.  I pulled the
distributor (SVDA with Compufire) and replaced it with my spare (a 009 with
Compufire).  Timing was spot on.  The gas tank was half full, but I put some
water remover in there, along with a little fresh gas.  I changed the fuel
filter.  None of this made a whit of difference.  I was barely able to start
it, with great difficulty, and in the process, a couple of backfires in the
carburator (30 PICT, 20 years old) blew out the the relief fitting at the
bottom rear of the carburator.  So now besides an engine that won't run
properly, I've got to do something about that damaged carburator.

I'd appreciate any thoughts from you folks.

Best,
Jerry
