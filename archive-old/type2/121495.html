Subject: Re: [T2] Engine wires?

&gt;Wire #1  -  A thicker one comes out of an in line fuse holder (reverse 
&gt;Lights, I think) and goes to where? + side of coil? Or wire harnes for all 
&gt;the rear lights.
&gt;
&gt;wire  #2  -  black, comes out of the same harness as the wire above but 
&gt;before the fuse and smaller. Where does this go? To the coil + or the wire 
&gt;harness for all the lights?

You've got it figured out. Both go to the pos side of the coil. The one 
that leads to the inline fuse holder is the reverse lights and the other is 
from the key. It is hot when the key is on.

The switch you mentioned sounds like it interrupts the power to the coil 
from the switch so it would in effect be a lockout like you theorized.

You can test the wiring like this. When the key is on (and the battery 
attached to it's cables) the wire from the kill switch should be hot.

When the tranny is in reverse (battery isn't important and nor is the 
ignition switch) and assuming the rest of the reverse circuit is good 
(unlikely based on my experience! &lt;grin&gt;) then you should be able to do a 
continuity test to ground and get a full loop circuit. (Continuity test 
shows good).

One end of that circuit is hot (presumably the wire you are holding) and 
the other end grounds to the frame through the fuse, the switch and then to 
both reverse lights. Doing a continuity test you are going from the ground 
all the way through the circuit to the end you are holding and through the 
meter. Full circle.
