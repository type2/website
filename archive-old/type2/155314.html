&gt;The oil pressure port visibility is blocked by the electric sender of

There's a place to put a wrench on the underside of the sender just above the threads. Naturally it's impossible to reach.

Years ago on the list, someone said that VDO made a key that fit the shape of the top of the oil pressure sender. I've been looking for one every since but each time I ask no one has ever heard it. I've even been through old VDO catalogs from the 80s. Jim?

It it was something I needed all the time I'd probably make one.
