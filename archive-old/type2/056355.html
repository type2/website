Subject: Pop top pops

There was a  thread on this subject in the archives, but I was wondering
if there were any new thoughts.
I am forced to hold down the front of my pop top on my '72 Westy by a
strap that connects to my gutters.  Otherwise my top will pop open.  The
straps do the trick, but are a bit cumbersome, especially as the strap
ages and the gutter hooks start to bend.

I am looking for a solution to hold the top down from the inside or
really get crazy and figure out away to the front hook to actually work
or modify the hook so it works.

Any suggestions are appreciated
