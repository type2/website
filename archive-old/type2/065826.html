Subject: re : ideal engine puller

hey all, i have this jack. i use it in the garage for my floor jack,
but I had to add about 8 inches if wood to the saddle to make it
go high enough to lift the bus off the ground. I didn't notice
that the swivel saddle comes off, but i will be looking into it.
thanks ken. i think the box reads max. lift to be about 15 inches,
so take this into account before purchase. anyway, it has worked well
so far, but I only use it for lift till i can get the jackstands
under it.. my $.02 worth converts to not too many pesos.......
