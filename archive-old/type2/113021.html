Subject: Oil sensor hole has rough face and leaks

Hello,

I have a 1970 Bus with a 1971 engine. Bought it about two weeks ago.

I had a VW shop go over it before I bought it, and they noticed there
was oil leaking around the oil pressure sender, so they replaced it.

I noticed oil dripping from the sender's nut today, and when I took it
off, I was surprised at the rough seam on the case, running right across
where the sender seats.

Here is a photo of what I'm talking about:

Is this normal? Should I carefully file the raised part away? Also,
what's up with the case's paint flaking? Is that paint factory spec'ed?
It seems to just rub off with a rag.

I am loving this bus, and he's already given me some good miles of
enjoyment. I'm in Tucson, and using Castrol straight 40 weight oil,
based on the repair shops recommendations.

Thanks for any help,
Jon Wade
