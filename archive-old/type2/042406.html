Greetings all -

We're going to the Los Angeles County Raceway (in Palmdale) tomorrow to go
watch our first &quot;VW only&quot; drag race.

We'll get pit parking, so if you see Itch (white 69 Westy) or me riding my
black Viza gas scooter, stop by and say hi.

I was going to take Itch down the track, but they want $50 to enter - I
could do a full tune-up and In-n-Out burgers for that money, so I'll just
cruz and watch the cars go by.

Have a great W/E.
