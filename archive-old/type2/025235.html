Subject: One more plug for EMPI spark plug sets, $6.99
Date: Wed, 4 Nov 1998 19:35:03 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I wanted to do a more direct plug for the EMPI Spark Plug Cable sets.  I
have installed 4 or 5 sets of these over the last 18 months and have had
great experience.  I have also mentioned them several times on the list and
have not heard any negative feedback....

The big difference with these is that the use the &quot;stub&quot; that goes over the
threads.  They are much easier to tell when you engage / disengage.  They
are 7mm 

Not associated, but I truly believe that this after-market items is both
cheaper and better quality / design than the OEM or Bosch replacements.

Does anyone have anything negative to say about this part?

P.S.  What provoked me to post this tonight was that JCwhipme, uh, I mean JC
Whitney is selling these right now for $6.99.  Foolish to not get two pairs
and carry a spare for the stranded VW motorist you encounter on the side of
the road.  They come in Blue / Red / Yellow or Orange.  Sorry, no black :)
