Subject: body/window seal adhesive

List,

I'm getting ready to put back together my 78 Westfalia after its new paint 
job and was wondering what brand and/or type of adhesive should be used for 
all my new seals?  (doors, engine, ect) It seems that there was glue of some 
sort on there when I took off the old seals. Or maybe there is not even 
supposed to be any glue. Also, any tips are welcome as its been well over a 
year since I took everything apart. Noise reduction, rust prevention and 
durability are some goals for the project.

All glass is out too. What brand/type or kind of sealant is best for the 
window seals. And I think I remember that thin weed whacker trimming line is 
useful for reinstalliation.

Thanks in advance,
Brandt in Utah
