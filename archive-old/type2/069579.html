Subject: bus headlights: was &quot;A couple o' questions (66 Westy)&quot;

&gt;&gt;      2: I need one new headlight assembly (i.e. glass lens, bucket
&gt;&gt; thing, etc.) can I use a beetle one or does anyone have a spare one for
&gt;&gt; sale?
&gt;A beetle ons should work, turned sideways. The adjusting will be different, I
&gt;think.

The orientation of the lensing on sealed beam headlamps is an important
consideration, and using bug light assemblies on a bus rotates the beam 90
degrees - not exactly a desired effect...  The sealed beams will not fit
correctly in the housing if you try to rotate them.
