Subject: Air Cooled Engine Rebuilds

I found a place about an hour South of the Washington, D.C. area that has been rebuilding air cooled VW engines since the 70s.  They only work on air cooled engines.  This shop, German Motorcars, is run by Wayne Dittmann on (540)752-5303.  I had him rebuild my 80 Westy.  I only have 500 miles on it so far, but will keep you posted on how well it does.  Has anyone else had an engine rebuilt there?
