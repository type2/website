Subject: Re: [T2] Firewall Question?

Hi Phil

Here is a photo of the ceiling of the engine bay,,  you can see the engine access
hatch as it is a 78 bus

Your looking at the foam in a plastic bag behind the cardboard layer held in with
large head rivits
Hope that helps

&gt; Phil,
&gt;         Was just looking at the one in my 72 today and it is pop riveted.
&gt; Aluminum Rivets with a fairly large head 10-13 mm dia. Hope this helps -

&gt; &gt; My 72 van never had the firewall above the engine when I purchased it. I
&gt; &gt; have since located the rectangular foam (wrapped in plastic) and the
&gt; &gt; metal squares (with holes). How are they attached to the underside of
&gt; &gt; the cargo area? Are they screwed? Pop Rivet? Welded? etc...
