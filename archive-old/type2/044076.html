Subject: [T2] Heads for trade...

Almost forgot.  I now have a pair of 79 2L heads, the ones with the
rectangular exhaust ports rather than the oval ones, that I don't need.
Maureen has a 78 engine with the oval ports.  I'd like to do a swap of these
heads for a set with the oval ports.  Objective is to construct a second
engine (already have a case, crankshaft, and many other odds n ends) to do a
transplant if/when it becomes necessary.

The heads include valves (utility unknown) and look to be in very good
shape, though they are a trifle dirty.  If you have a set of heads to trade,
I'll see about taking some photos and posting them to you for evaluation.
Respond by private email please.

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
