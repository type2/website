Subject: RE: Valve clearances

1. Are all the valves should be set w/ the same clearance ? I read Muir, 
Bentley and AFAIK
same clearance.

Yes. Volkswagen said .006 for all Type 1 valves. I'm assuming you have a 
Type 1 engine. I can't speak for Type IVs although I *think* the ones with 
solid lifters used the same clearance.

2. If not, what will happen if I set intake valve tighter or looser than 
exhaust valve ?

Nothing much, unless you're talking about a huge difference. I often set my 
intakes a hair tighter, and know people who set them at .004. Intake valves 
settings should hold themselves well over the miles because they run a lot 
cooler than exhausts and don't stretch much.

3. Should I set the clearance differently if I install an A/C unit for my 
bus ?

I don't think so, although in a hot climate I might go to a colder plug 
(W7AC for a Type 1).

4. Tigher clearance means the valve opens longer than loose one ?

Yes, that's right, although the difference in duration between a valve set 
to .005 and one set to .006 is rather small. The inverse is also true of a 
tight valve: the valve is closed for a shorter time. This affects it's 
ability to cool itself and a tight valve will run hot, maybe stretch and 
thus get even tighter.

Unless you're going to check your valves often, just setting them all at 
.006 will get you out of the woods. If it's a new engine (I gather from the 
&quot;dyno oil&quot; comment it is), you'll want to check them often, as the cam and 
lifters will wear in and change the settings (also generally they'll get 
looser).

Good luck.
