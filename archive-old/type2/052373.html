&gt;the 71'  bus has a port forthe power brake's vacuum. The beetle and previous
&gt;busses didn't have this Jack!

Just to add a little more confusion and profess my ignorance of the
finer points of early &quot;late bus&quot; lore,  it appears that master cylinders
from 1968 were available with servo or without. What's up with that ?
