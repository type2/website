Nathan-
The oil issue seems to be a topic for long discussion. I personally think
you're mechanic is correct, especially if you live in a colder climate. I
think John Muir said in his book that he used straight 30 weight oil at all
times. This is kind of misleading because he lived in New Mexico. Straight
30 is too thick for colder weather (below 40 degrees F), and I wouldn't want
to run straight 20 long term. I believe modern multi-weight oils have really
improved. I would stick with a major brand though.
I've experienced the froth in the oil cap as well, and if I recall correctly
it has something to do with carburetor icing. You'll find if you go on a
longer trip where the engine has a chance to really warm up it will
disappear. If your doing a lot of around town driving you may want to change
your oil at more regular intervals.
