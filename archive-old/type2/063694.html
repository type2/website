So Thom Fitzpatrick says:

&gt; 
&gt; Its been a couple years since I've seen a split-window at a pick-n-pull.  I
&gt; pulled every last piece off that baby I could, too!
 - -- -

I  dont see a lot of splits in junkyards around here.   partly because there
arent as many around as there used to be, and partly as mike and i have
scrounged a lot of them in the area.    and john's auto wrecking actually
CRUSHED out a bunch of cars, and they had a few completely stripped splits.

the other day a friend &amp; i were playing name that year in downtown oly.   she
thought it was really funny.   id name the year on the bug or bay window, but
on the couple splits i'd know the driver too.  (ie, hey, i didn't know casey
was back in town - 66 westy)

ten years ago i'd always see half a dozen or so splits in the junkyards near
my moms house on the SF penninsula.    not anymore.   they arent getting
junked like they used to.
