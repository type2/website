Subject: At wits end, the story of full tank no go, 1/2 tank runs like a champ

Hello,
A short history...
5 weeks ago and 650 miles from home my 1977 westy engine gave up the
ghost, it had lost compression, and gave out a pop followed by a pool of
oil and much nasty smoke. I decided that instead of finding out what
exactly had given (maybe just a seal..) that it was time to get a
new/rebuilt engine. I had it towed to a an aircooled vw mechanic, he was
not up for doing the rebuild himself, so I did some research and went
with a crate engine from AVP.

This past saturday I drove my rent a car back to Washington DC, excited
as a child on Christmas morning to get my beloved bus back, and to see
what it wa like to drive it with a fresh engine.

It has more power than I could have ever envisioned, I have held her
back as I want to fully break in the new engine.

I get about 50 miles from the mechanics, stop and fill her up, she was
at the low end of the red zone on the gas gauge. I fill her with premium
93 octane Mobil gas. Turn the key, she fired up and then dies. No idle.
I try adjusting the idle screw, I can get her to idle but when I start
to drive I get about 20 yards and she stalls out. It is 3am and I decide
that I am not suppose to leave Daly City, Virginia that night. I camp
out at the mobil station. 

I screw around all day Sunday, checking every hose, every plug, every
ground, I pull the fuel filter to see if it is clogged (btw, if you are
going to do this be prepared for an incredible flow of gas, I was
covered in it, I had no idea that it would come out that fast and
strong). I end up having it towed back to the mechanic. He took a quick
look and tried a couple things to no avail. It will run and it will run
well on the highway, so he suggests I get it home, that way I will
become someone elses problem not his.

I take off at 9pm Sunday for Atlanta, it runs great on the highway, I
cruise along at 65 mph with my foot in the same position on the gas
peddle that it used to run at 50 mph. I am nervous about having to stop
and refuel, but it turns out to be a breeze, I pull in and it stays
idling, no stall, just purrs. I fill up and once again no idle, I have
to keep my foot on the accelerator or it will die. It runs rough with
occassional hestitations until the gas gauge reads under 3/4 of a tank.

Same thing the whole way home, full tank or even a half tank refilled
from near empty and hesitations, stalls no idle.

I make it home late yesterday, this morning I go out start it up, it
idles, it is idling very low, so after it has warmed up I reset the
idle. As I am walking around the side I decided to take off the gas cap.
I turn it but am unable to open it, I get a little screw driver and
careful wedge it and pop it off. The sound of air rushing in is loud,
and the idle shoots up to a fast high idle. I put the cap back on and it
slows back down again. I look at the cap and though I have never paid
that much attention to it, I think it is not the same cap as the one
that had been on it when I left it with the mechanic. When I start to
put the cap back on again I can feel suction as it screws shut. I hear a
slight crinkle of metal sound as if the tank is contracting in. Take the
cap off and once again their is resistance.

I ended up drilling a hole in the cap, to vent it, and thought that I
had solved
problem, it ran great. I mean perfect, no hesitation, full power, nice
steady idle.
The tank was at between 1/4 and 1/2. The final test was to take it up to
the gas 
and fill it up. I did this, filled with mid grade 89 octane brand name
gas. Much to
my disappointment I attempt to start it, and it won't idle and then has
difficulty
starting.  I drove her home, running very rough constantly wanting to
stall unless 
I keep her floored. 

I am at wits end, how is it possible that at 1/4-&gt;1/2 tank it runs great
and at full
tank it barely runs?

If anyone out there has any suggestions, ideas etc. please, please email
me with them. I will post the end result of how this is resolved for the
possible benefit of others on here. 
Thanks,
scoob
