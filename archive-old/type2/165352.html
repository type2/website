&quot;Who's that Girl?&quot;....

&quot;What's that noise?&quot;

Just last Friday I started getting an odd clunk sound when I hit a
bump and occasionally when hitting the brakes. Twice over the weekend
I crawled around under the front of the bus but couldn't find
anything. Pads good, rotors good, wheel bearings good, suspension
components tight, steering components tight, etc.

Today it was WAY worse. Backing out of a parking space, I hit the
brakes to hear a gravel noise from the front axle somewhere!
Arrgghhh!!!

Tonight I took the wheels off and took a closer look. Oops. What's
that shiny spot on the left caliper? I'M MISSING THE BOLT!!!

Sigh.

The bolt was probably there during the previous inspections, but
loose. I didn't think to check that it was actually tight. Duh. Now
it's somewhere in Boulder most likely...

:(

(Yes, I emailed Chris just a minute ago... That's not a part I have spares of.)

Lucky for me I work literally across the street. :)
