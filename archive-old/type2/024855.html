&lt;&lt;I got (via EBAY) from Knut Erbs in New Zealand an original VW &quot;parts order&quot;
book for bus 68-79 years.  Nice condition -Dated 1981, and titled (in 6
languages) GENUINE PARTS   Type2 Mod.68-79.
   Looks like what the dealer has on microfilm, showing the relationships
of parts in different systems (including the gas heaters).
However, there are no descriptions of the parts, just a contents page
listing the system for a page #  and serial part #s for the page.  Often
model  year differences are shown in different drawings on one page- with
no clue to which year it refers.  For instance, the shiftrod bushing at the
frontmost part of the rod is 57-15 for what I know from other catalogs to
be for pst 74 busses, aand there is a drawing showing the earlier version
for the rod that the shift rod cup rides on, #57-19.  Somewhere must exist
descriptions for the parts and their numbers, as well as official VW parts
numbers?  Any ex - dealers out there who can help?

Sorry, but don´t know what they cost.  And, you will need to find a VW parts 
guy that is willing to order these for you.  I took my copy of the Eurovan 
book into the dealer to show them they it indeed does exist.  

Now don´t tell anyone about these, as I am planning on buying a bunch and 
selling them on ebay. - just kidding.
