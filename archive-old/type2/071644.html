Hello,

Scott (the Bus Nut) Solomon had some good points in regard
to stock vs. after-market shifters.  

I recently had the opportunity to sit in a '66 that had all new
hangers, couplers, NOS stock shifter, yada, yada, yada,  and
was very impressed (reminded of the good old days) on just
how tight and precise a plain Jane VW shift linkage can be.  

On the after-market shifters my preference is for the Gene Berg.
The Scat Drag Fast is OK while the others are just a waste of
chrome and money-again, in my opinion.  If you just want a 
short throw then you might consider one of the high quality 
(aluminum not plastic) spacer kits that will fit under a stock 
shifter.
