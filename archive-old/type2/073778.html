Subject: Re: [T2] Gel Battery

I understand Costco has a gel type battery for a good price.......also,
wholesale on an Optima is around $95.......a friend that owns a vw shop was
just pitched by the sales rep.

&gt; Optima's are great.  More expensive, but worth the money.  You'll need to
get a starter battery (red top) and a deep cycle battery (yellow top).
They're about the same size as any other battery, so they'll fit fine.  If
your charging system is working for the 2 batteries you have now, it'll work
with the 2 Optima's.  By the way, don't pay retail.  I just bought a yellow
top from a place in New Mexico called TNT Distributing.  $127, plus $16
shipping, $143 to my doorstep.  I can get you a phone number if you can't
find them on the web.

&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a 1972 VW Camper with a 1979 Interior.  I Have a dual batter
setup, with a starting battery from volkswagen, and a cheap deep cycle
battery.  Both batteries are getting weak.  I am considering replacing them
with Optima batteries.
