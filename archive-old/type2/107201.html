Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix &quot;gap&quot;

I have a stock vacuum advance distributor model #231-168-005. I threw away
the box for the Pertronix but the number on the module itself is 02X-V4. I
bought it from an import parts store and it was for a stock dizzy. Since the
dwell reading is within spec do I really have anything to worry about?

Thanks
Jasan C.

&gt; &gt;Hmm... Could I have bought a bad module?  What else could be causing a

&gt; What kind of distributor do you have and what is the pertronix part
number?
