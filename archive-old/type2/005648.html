Subject: Re: [T2] childs cot. its for a 72, i have a 76. why did I think that would work?

[...]

What I said was:  74/75 are 57 1/4'' long, they will fit in 76 to 79 buses
but you will have a hard time storing them.
68-73 are 56 1/4'' long.

The cot material is the same for all.

2 choices: find the right ones or raise the half-moons up about 2''.

&gt; I had the chance to pick up a nice childs cot from someone at a realy good
&gt; price. For some reason, I swear I saw a post here that said the 69 - 73
cots
&gt; would also fit the 76-79 model years, but since it would not fold down I
&gt; would have trouble storing it.
&gt;
&gt; Well it appears I or whomever posted that was wrong. It is about half of
an
&gt; inch short, seemingly, from fitting.
&gt;
&gt; Can I rig it to work, or just hope I run into someone with an older bus
and
&gt; a newer cot that made the same mistake? HA!
