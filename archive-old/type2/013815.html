as usual change the *'s, do they still have the filter?

I know nothing except this guy has 2 genuine 2.0's and the one with tin looks
in fair shape but has been sitting without plugs or covers on the ports so it
is hard to say.  He has a &quot;0 mile&quot; 1.7, another 1.7, and a 1.8 I think.
The 2.0
heads are rare folks of course, and could be a deal for someone, as could be
the rebuilt 1.7.  Most of them have 914 tin on them, all are 914 cases with in
the case dipsticks but I think those will fit in a bus fine, the Vanagon
version
does.  It will make checking/changing the oil a PITA.  Anyway a long time left
on the auctions so who knows what they'll get to.  The rebuilt 1.7 is probably
not in demand though.

Union City, is that SD?
