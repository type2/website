Subject: Re: [T2] I hate my carbs

&gt;That FI from those 411 and 412 is tricky business, unless you get it 
&gt;off a 74..that was AFC.  The older stuff is manifold pressure controlled, 
&gt;and you have to have the correct heads or heads that are tapped with 
&gt;breather pipes for it to work right.  AFC is much easier to work on.
&gt;
&gt;My 412 has the old stuff, and it was tricky to get it to work.parts 
&gt;are NLA and only found on another donor vehicle.............

The above is not exactly true.  The 411, 412, Porsche 914 1.7 and 2.0 all
had Bosch D-jet FI.  Granted it is a completely different and less
sophisticated animal than the L-jet found on the buses, but it is still a
perfectly good FI system.

The breathers on the heads are not required for D-jet.  And most parts of
this system are still available either rebuilt or new.  As to which is
easier to work on?  Well, that probably depends on which system you're more
familiar with.  

Some things that ARE required to change a non-FI bus to FI are:  Head tapped
for temp sensor, second nipple on gas tank for fuel return, and of course
the COMPLETE FI system from the donor including fuel pump, distributor (if
you're going to D-jet), all sensors, wiring harness, cpu, various relays,
fuel rails, fuel injectors and intake runners, plenum, etc.

I'm running D-jet on both my 74 914 2.0 and my 73 Westy with 914 2.0 motor
and am quite happy with the system.  Between the 2 vehicles, I've logged
over 80K miles and have never had the FI systems give me any problems
whatsoever.  I've driven the Westy everywhere from sea-level to the top of
Mt Evans at just over 14,000 feet and the FI system performs flawlessly.

YMMV.
