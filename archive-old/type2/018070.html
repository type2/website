&gt; Does one of these exist in the brake system of a '78 Bus.  I have looked

&gt; this.  These things are put in line to the front disc to maintian some
&gt; level of minimum pressure on the front discs.  2 psi is a typical valve
&gt; value.  I am aware of the porportioning valve that is between the front
&gt; and rear and it is separate from the one that I am inquiring about.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; Does anybody have a brake system diagram for the '78 bus?

Scott:
There are small BB-sized check valves that bear against rubber seats
under the brass outlet fittings on some VW master cylinders. I've not
looked at those on a 78 vintage m/c, though there's one here in my
massive collection of rusty stuff. These would hold a tiny bit of
pressure, maybe in that range.
