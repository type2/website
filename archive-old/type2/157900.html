Subject: Re: [T2] scary noise

Hell yeah!!

2 summers back I was SURE that the vanagon I was driving had a bad CV  
joint...that was up until the drivers side rear wheel passed me by.  
Luckily I had a couple nuts left in the hubcap and I was able to find  
another on the road so as to limp home with it.

I check the lug nuts IMMEDIATELY whenever I hear a sound like that.

Happy Trails,

&gt; Check your wheel lug nuts.  Yes, check your FRONT ones, too!!!

&gt; And you can often get a better idea from where the noise is coming by
&gt; posting a listening sentinal on the outside of your 'bus', who can
&gt; listen as you cruise by.
