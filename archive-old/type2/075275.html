Mexican busses never had the T4 engine and havent had the aircooled 1600
for a number of years. I suppose some parts may become less available but
Im not sure what they would be. I imagine that VW will still crank out
service parts for a number of years and Brazil production is still on so
far. Type 4 engines still seem to get supported pretty well and I think
theyve been out of production for 14 or so years, right?
It is always possible that VW will have mercy on us and see their way to
supporting the hobby at some point.
not holding my breath for fear of dying.
