Subject: Re: [T2] Perceived Value of T4 2L engine cores and avoid being ripped off
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

a core charge is a &quot;profir ceter&quot; for many rebuilers, they know you will not 
return it so they make more money....

and it gives them some leeway if you turn in an engine with no rebuilable 
parts, if they do not have rebuilable parts they cannot supply engines and 
the people they buy parts from (head builers, crank grinders etc) charge them 
for cores

but there is no way your junk engine is worth the core charge, they cannot 
see inside it to see if there is anything useable......

If you can get half the core charge you would be doing good

been doing motors for 20 years plus..........
