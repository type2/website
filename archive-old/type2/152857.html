&gt; Wow, where the heck did that come from?
&gt; 
&gt; If you think that tracking down obscure parts or tooling from all over the
&gt; globe for 30 year old vehicles that most manufacturers forgot about decades
&gt; ago is as simple as &quot;buying and selling someone else's labor,&quot; than you are
&gt; naove. It's a detective game just to find a lot of this stuff, and then you
&gt; have to convince them to produce it and make sure it's right.  (Ratwell
&gt; could vouch for that, having done it with the Koni shocks.) Why do you think
&gt; the full-line commodity auto parts retailers only cherry-pick the
&gt; easy-to-get Bus stuff?  Not that I'm bragging - many people do it besides
&gt; me, and do it well - but don't trivialize that which you don't know. Many
&gt; things look easy to someone who doesn't know any better. Perhaps your line
&gt; of work would as well, to an outsider who hadn't actually done it.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides that has nothing to do with my comment, which - quite ironically -
&gt; was to second Dawn's comment about how friendly so many Bus folk are.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and by the way, it's Bus Depot, not Depoo. :-)
