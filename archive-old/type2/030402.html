Subject: Losing ground(s) - FI problem diagnosed but not fixed

Volks,

I have located the problem that stopped my bus, but have not been able to
fix it because I am missing one more bit of info.  Thanks to everyone, but
especially Steve Blackham, I have found that there is no ground to pins 5,
16, and 17 on the wiring harness, which is what I suspected but cound not
find previously.  Alas, now that I know what the problem is, you'd think I
could fix it just by pluging up the disconnected wire, but *I CAN'T FIND
IT!*  the Bentley manual shows white wires exiting the FI ECU and joining
a brown wire at a single connector, then heading for ground.
Where (physicaly) is this connector??????

As a side note, I remember distictly that at one time I saw a page with a
diagnostic for the ECU with current/resistance values for each pin, but I
was unable to find it yesterday/today.  Does anyone know where it got to?
(I know it is still out there, but I just can't find the right tags to
click :-)
