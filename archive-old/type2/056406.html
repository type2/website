Subject: RE: heat riser cleaning... sandblasting?

Tom,

This is actually a very easy procedure that I've used.  I even posted to
both vintagvw and type2 months back.

If you have access to a sand blaster, all you need to do is make sure
you can get SOME air through.  It works AWESOME.  Just point the blaster
into the riser end and pull the trigger (make sure the sand isn't coming
out the end).  Make sure you are wearing gloves and don't point the
other end of the riser right at your face &lt;grin&gt;.

I use the silicate that Home Depot sells ( they only sell one type for
blasting ) and a $20 siphon feed blaster.

Might not hurt to visit Bry's and get a second manifold -- clean it up
and have it ready before you switch.

BTW:  I have found that the BEST heat riser / tin / paint is Hammerite
(spelling?).  It works a lot better than engine enamel or other stuff.
Also it has none of the nastiness of POR15 and other such solutions
have.  I did some of my tin a few months back and it holds up well to
oil/grease spills and clean-up.  All other paints I have tried to tend
to break down if you get oil on them.  NEXT TRIAL:  I coated my new
type2 muffler with Hammerite and will be installing it this week.  Will
report how well it works.   I had previously tried black grill/stove
paint on a muffler and heat exchangers, but it tends to flake off gets
too hot and &quot;dry&quot;.  Hammerite seems to be &quot;thicker&quot; and stick a lot
better.  Comes in spray or brush-on.  Home Depot / Eagle Hardware sell
it for $5 a can spray or various sizes.   About double what normal paint
costs, but this stuff is worth trying!  I recommend the brush on for
muffler or heat exchangers, I tend to double coat and let it dry for a
long time (week or more) before use.

[snip]

I was looking for a heat riser for my 65 bug (my 71 bus has the same) as
I've been getting substantial carb throat icing while warming up.  I was
talking with a guy selling stuff at the show, and he mentioned taking it
to a company that sandblasts things and asking them to throw the riser
into the bin to get blasted.

Or at least that's what I interpreted.  Has anyone tried this?  I think
I'd rather pay someone $10 to blast it out than spending hours with a
flexible drill bit and a coat hanger.... Or maybe I'm overstating the
problem.
