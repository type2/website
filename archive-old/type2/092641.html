&gt;Many vendors are not using &quot;German&quot; part numbers but VW part numbers.

German production VW numbers begin with &quot;0&quot;, Brazilian begin with &quot;9&quot;. 
That's how you know. That first no. is the code for the country supervising 
the manufacturing process, and is the indication of who's specifications 
are in play. To advertise for sale a German specification part, then send a 
non-German specification part is quite frankly, a step beyond deception. 
It's a flat out lie. In other words, fraud.

&gt;   The vast majority of rebuilt bosch in the US is rebuilt in brazil.

Anyone can rebuild a Bosch part anywhere they want with whatever procedures 
or specs or lack thereof they want. Many FLAPS will call these &quot;Bosch 
Rebuilds&quot;. Bosch Corp. remanufactured electrical rotating parts sold in the 
USA are rebuilt in a Bosch Corp. facility in the USA under Bosch Corp. 
procedures and specifications. It's apples and oranges, folks.

As a Bosch Corporation Authorized Parts Specialist, I receive info every 
week or two from Bosch Corp. giving particulars about their manufacturing 
locations, procedures and quality control. Bosch Corp. does no rebuilding 
at all. Their process is remanufacturing. A Bosch Remanufactured part meets 
NEW specifications, and will last every bit as long as new. In fact, in 
those cases where they run short on cores, if you order a Remanufactured 
part you get what Bosch calls a NewMan part, which is in fact a brand new 
part at the remanufactured price in the unique Bosch Corp. ReMan packaging.
