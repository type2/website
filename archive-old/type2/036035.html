Subject: RE: save heat

&gt; I just came across a product (in a marine professional journal) called
&gt;Delta Coat marine insulating coating that advertizes an R11-15 rating.
&gt;Spray, roll, or brush on metal or other surfaces.  See it at
&gt;www_dot_deltacoat_dot_com


This sounds like a GREAT idea.  I saw this product on a PBS home show and
they gave a quick little demonstration.  They sprayed half of a thin piece
of plywood with this product, the other half they left plain.  Then with a
heat lamp behind the plywood (simulating the sun) they took temperature
measurements off of each half of the plywood.  There was a 20š difference
between the coated and uncoated side!

On the home show, they were spraying the underside of house roofs in order
to reduce the temperature under the roof.

But a great idea for all backsides of exterior panels in the bus.  It can
be sprayed, or brushed.  Combine this with some other type of sound
deadener/insulation and it should make a fairly warm in winter, cool in
summer bus.
