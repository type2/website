&gt; I'm not a VW guru -- far from it! -- but I am taking a VW maintenance class

&gt; *He* says: the 009 is strictly a racing distributor, St. Muir
&gt; notwithstanding. It has a terrible advance curve for everyday driving. *He*
&gt; says, stick with the stock distributor, which I think in your case is the
&gt; centrifugal/vacuum advance, which *he* calls &quot;the best distributor VW ever
&gt; made.&quot;
&gt; 
I just thought I would ask, Are you refering to the all Vacuum advance or
the combo vacuum/centrifugal advance model? VW had three different styles 
- - was not sure which you were refering to.
