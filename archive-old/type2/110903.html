&gt; Then it came time to reinstall -- a friend and i got the engine in and

&gt; to within 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; of its final destination  (i.e., the lower trans
&gt; studs are currently flush with the hole they will eventually come out of in
&gt; 1/4 to 1/2&quot;).  we can't seem to make any further progress... i'd like to
&gt; finish the engine install as it is beginning to consume all my thoughts...

I would try 2 things. One is make sure nothing is in the way for the
engine to mate w/ the tranny. Two try putting the tranny in neutral
(if not already) &amp; turning the crank shaft a bit. sometimes helps.
Three (I know I said two) make sure it's aligned correctly, especially
up and down.
