&gt;agree completely! If you look at engines with K &amp; Ns on them, they routinely
&gt;have ring, piston, and cylinder wear at 30-40K miles.  They move a lot of
&gt;air, but a lot of abrasives come in with it.

Then those engines have not been maintained properly.  I've run a K&amp;N on my
Mustang for about the last 100K miles (now has 203k total).  Good
compression and runs like a scalded cat.  If I could find a K&amp;N to fit my
bus, I would use it.  I may not drive on dirt roads every day but dust
builds up on my car daily even sitting in the garage.

Regarding oil bath systems, there is a reason they are not used anymore.
Driving up that dusty road, what happens when you stop?  Dust wafts it's
way into the engine compartment and into the intake, where there is no
particle velocity to drive it into the oil.  Next time you start your
engine, you suck in a bunch of dirt.  I also don't see how they could
filter small particles well at low velocity (like at idle).  I'll take my
oiled K&amp;N over oil bath under any and all conditions.
