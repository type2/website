Yes, George, only one high point would simplify things
a lot. I keep looking at my humps over the rear axle
and envisioning them as big air-locks. I wonder why I
didn't put any bleeder valves there - I think it was
really tight. This time I had the front end up on
ramps when I refilled the system and it went more
smoothly than ever before. I just opened the bleeder
at the throttle body and the bleeder at the heater and
it pretty much just filled. I had to add about a half
gallon later, so I had at least a half-gallon of air
pockets and expect there are still some. -BaH

 That's what the Custom Off Road Subie conversions do
 in Oz.
 
 Seems like bleeding the cooling system would be a
 lot easier when it only
 has one &quot;high point&quot;.
