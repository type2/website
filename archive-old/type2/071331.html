Subject: Re: Can anyone assis in my VW Truck needs?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Everyone,

I am in desperate need of a single or crew cab bus DONOR. What I am 
specifically looking for is rear bed floor panels.  I don't need much, just a 
couple of pieces to patch my truck up.  Does anyone here know if late model 
Vanagon pick ups used the same style bed floors?  Any help would be 
appreciated!

Dave
