Sounds like a pretty expenseive proposition.  And time consuming..
I've come to realize that the value of an old vw is an equation in which the
value of what isn't there is much greater than the value of what is there.    At
first I say Wow!!!look at all the cool stuff I get for only  $$$XXXXX!!! But
each missing item may cost as much to replace as everything else you already
have.  Unless you have a lot of time and patience and Money..It seems the wise
course is just to wait until you can buy what you want in generally good and
complete condition.  Wiser and Cheaper. 

Vanagon................$300 (wow...its in great shape..no rust....almost
everything is here....) Almost

new windshield....$250
tires.........................$450
Brake work............$150
pistons/cylinders  
gaskets etc.............$500
Miscellaneous       
parts from junk.......$550
total parts               $2200
Labour _at_$25/hr   $1500
total investment 
to date.......................$3750

book value of van    $3500
True cost of comparable van  $2800

Value of lessons learned and knowledge gained....??  Hard to say...pretty high i
guess....
I just  hope I take my own advice Next time!   John Jensen in Annapolis...
