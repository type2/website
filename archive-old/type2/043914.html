Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix and spark plugs

Jack Dinan sends:

&gt; I'm about to install a Petronix and a CD ignition system on my 1776.  The
&gt; instructions say that spark plugs can be opened up quite a bit from the
&gt; stock value.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the theory behind this?
&gt; Is it necessary to do so to run with the Petronix and CD? Or can I leave
&gt; the gaps as they are?

The CDI puts out more power than the stock ignition, so it's capable of
making the spark jump a wider point gap than the standard ignition.

A wider point gap gives a hotter spark, which means more efficient burning
of the fuel, which means &quot;free&quot; horsepower since all the fuel you're putting
into the cylinder can be burned. It's not necessary--you can run a .028&quot;
stock gap with this system if you want--but I'd do it anyway. Like Bluto
said in &quot;Animal House,&quot; don't cost nuthin'.

I run a MSD at .050&quot; gap. They tell me you can go wider, but this works for
me.
