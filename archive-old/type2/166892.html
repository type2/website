Subject: Frame section

I have tried Busted? Bus and The Bus Co. for a frame section to replace my mouse pee?rusted area where the brake prop. valve mounts.? 
Unfortunately they can't do me any good right now.
Does anyone know of someone else who parts buses that might be able to supply a small section of frame rail?
OR, does anyone know if the frame section in that area is the same on all Bays?? I think I can chop what I need from a '72, if it is the same (can't really get close enough to look right now, it's 20 miles away, no wheels, and full of bees)
Thanks, Greg
