Subject: Rear Brake Hose installation

Hi everyone,



I replaced my front brake hoses today and then stopped because I
couldn't figure out where the rear brake hoses are located. I saw what I
believe the brake hoses to be and those are located behind the engine
and tucked up near the floor of the bus. Those seem ridiculously
challenging to get to so I really hope those aren't them. There is
another set of 'lines' that could be it but they seem much too long,
they go from what I think the brake hoses are into the rear drum brake
assembly. My two manuals, haven't gotten a Bentley yet; show the front
brake hoses but not the rear. I just want to be sure when I put my
wrench on a part that I am not doing work where it is not needed. Any
help would be appreciated. I apologize in advance for the bad
description just can't figure a better way to say it.

Thanks,



Max Bronsema
