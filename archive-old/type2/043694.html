Subject: Re: streeeetched studs

The studs have to match the expansion rate of the cylinders, 
the case expansion rate is not important. The heads might 
have a little influence on this too. Chromoly does not have the 
proper expansion rate for either aluminum or cast iron 
cylinders. They will just pull the studs out of the case. The 
stock studs are designed to provide proper tension on the 
heads and cylinders at operating temperature. The initial 
torque on these when cold is rather low. VW went from 10mm 
head studs to 8mm head studs to further perfect the the 
expansionrate in relation to the cylinders. If I were replacing 
them I would only use Genuine VW 8mm studs, nothing else, 
even on a very high horsepower type-1 based street engine. 
Berg sells the genuine VW article in kit form, complete with 
all the nuts and washers needed, and they are black oxidized 
to prevent rust. It is the best you can buy.

Magnesium Porsche cases are very rare. The early 25 Hp 
based Porsche cases were of course, some very early 911 
or experimental cases were, and maybe some that were used 
in race cars. 

Hope it helps, 

Brian

&gt;Stick with Genuine VW or genuine Chromoly.
