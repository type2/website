Subject: Wire Routing 

I'm ALMOST ready to put my rebuilt 2.0L back in the bus. Ordered a new
distributer from Philbin today; the old one works, but it's long of
tooth...it can still be my spare.

Anyhoo... all of my FI wiring was originally run under the intake runners,
which made it hard to unplug stuff for maintenance.  I'm thinking of routing
the wiring more out in the open for easy access.  The only possible reason I
can think of for hiding the FI wires would maybe be to keep them seperate
from spark plug wires? Anybody have any thoughts or experience?

Thanks,
RickG
