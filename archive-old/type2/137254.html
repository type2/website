Hi Volks!

&gt; Having lost an emblem to some punk gang-banger type, I would suggest

Might work well against the casual thief, but if they have
a screwdriver handy, they will still get the emblem -- *and*
scar your front sheetmetal in the process.  IMHO it's easier
to just let them have the thing.

Airhowlingly yours,
