Subject: Seen FS - '67 Westy

I called about a locally advertised bus this weekend. Turns out it's about
a mile from where I live (Cheyenne, WY).

Upon inspection, I found a quite delapidated (sp?) but very solid, mostly
complete '67 (non poptop) camper van. I assume it is a Westy although I saw
no ID plates. Body has _very_ little rust and is really straight except for
a shot it took in the left rear corner while parked on the street. Paint is
bad - currently dark green, originally white I believe. Has a 1600 dual
port installed. Supposedly rebuilt along with gearbox and brakes &quot;a couple
of years ago&quot;. Interior is kind of rough, but appears complete and
restorable.

If any of you wannabussers out there need more info, let me know and I'll
see what I can find out. Was it not for approx. 162 current projects
waiting for attention, I'd prolly jump on this one.

Oh, almost forgot, when asked about price, the seller said $1000.
Justifiying that, at least to himself, by saying he had bought it for $300
and had put $1300 into repairs. My quess would be more like $500-$600 would
be a fair price. I could be wrong on this (in either direction), but I'm
sure you'll let me know if I am. ;-)
