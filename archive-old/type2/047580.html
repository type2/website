In the UK you can get them from www.justkampers.co_dot_uk they do great service
and are the most impressive parts company I know. If you're really keen I'm
sure they'll send it to you. Check out the Desktop wallpaper on the
Interactive part of the site you can see how great those covers look, didn't
take long till I had one on my van, the biggest VW sign doing big hommage.

Subject: [T2] VW emblem spare tire cover



I have seen a few late model buses (with front mount spare tire) that have
spare tire covers with the big VW emblem on them.  I have a 75 camper with
front mount spare and I am dying to find one of these covers.  I've tried
Motorworks, BusDepot, Bus Stop, and many other parts suppliers but can't
seem to find them...Any one have any idea where I can get my paws on one???
Thanks, John Baker
