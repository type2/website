There should have been numerious articles on the subject.  In short, don't
do it!!!  You will be money, time and fewer headaches ahead if you just put
a type 4 engine back in.  The type 4 engine is superior to the type 1,
that's why VW went to them.  Not only that, but you will have to redo the
engine tin and fabricate a rear cross member, which in itself will take you
bunch of time and money.

The short of it is, no matter how nice you drive your bus, a type 1 on the
average will only last 60-100,000 miles in a bay window bus, while a type 4
engine will go 150-200,000 on average.  Plus you will have more power.

I just came back from a 5,000 mile plus trip in my '76 2L bus which took me
over some of the highest mountain passes in the US.  I did this pulling a
Scamp trailer.  On top of that, at one point on the trip, I pulled a loaded
'64 westy up hill to Flagstaff from California for about 500 miles.  Try
that with a type 1!!!!!

My engine is just fine and I am planning many more trips this summer and
fall, some of which will be over 1000 miles.  And of course in my engine I
was using 20W-50 oil and the Lucas oil additive.

With the price of type 4 engines, why would you want to put yourself through
the pains of an engine swap?

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I am looking for some information regarding what it would take to put a
&gt; 1600 engine into a 74 bus.  A fellow member of the Long Island Bus Alliance
&gt; has 2 1600s on hand and has an opportunity to pick up a 74 bus for next to
&gt; nothing.  If someone could give me an overview of what's needed I would
&gt; appreciate it, the details can wait until he decides whether to do it or
&gt; not.  I checked the library and there are no articles there on this switch,
&gt; maybe you could point me in another direction.  Thanks in Advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul A.
