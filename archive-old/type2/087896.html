Subject: Re:Please help my semi-camper my bus

Jay,
    Seems the type2 list has given you some pretty good answers on the z-bed
and electrical questions you posed.  Let me put in my 2 cents on the subject
of staying warm, as I have some experience with that from winter backpacking
as well as bus camping.  We&quot;ve (me and my wife Kathy) found that a good
quality, zero degree, sleeping bag works good.  On REALLY  cold nights we
put a light weight fleece blanket down on the bed  to lay on top of, and
then cover ourselves with the sleeping bag unzipped, so it lays flat like a
blanket. In addition, a good knit hat will keep your head warm during the
night.  That combination keeps us toasty warm. Just make sure to wear your
socks to sleep in so you don't have to put your bare feet on the cold floor
in the morning...bbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
