Subject: Re: [T2] CVS clamps and half axles

Remove CVs from the axles, clean, regrease and reinstall with new boots.

I found mine to make a vibration at high speeds with low loads on them 
(steady state).

Yours will be fine I'm sure. I drove mine for about 14K miles with no boots 
on them at all on a couple joints.

I replaced mine with Auto Zone axles. No miles on them yet so I cannot 
comment.

I won't discourage you on Bus Depot or any other online seller. It was 
simply a question of time (I thought) and prices.

Good luck.

&gt;I am pulling the tranny and motor and have removed the half axles. Besides 
&gt;replacing the tranny one of the things I needed to do was fix leaking CV 
&gt;boots. The boots look in excellent shape. However, 3 of the 4 are throwing 
&gt;grease every where from the narrow ends (what a muck fess!!!). I read that 
&gt;older busses (mine is a 79) used clamps. Any one use hose or other clamps 
&gt;on newer buses? A couple more questions:
&gt;1) I heard no grinding or problematic noises from the CVS - I should be OK 
&gt;just repacking with grease and using these right?
&gt;2) If using clamps is not a good solution, then is it more expensive to 
&gt;have the CVS pressed off put new boots on and then have the CVS
&gt;pressed on than buying the half axles that bus depot is selling? TIA
