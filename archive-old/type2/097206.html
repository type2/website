&gt; This distributor has a single vacuum advance. I don't know the model 
&gt; number but the guy at the auto parts store figured it out when I told 
&gt; him my points came without the hinge pin because the hinge pin was part 
&gt; of the distributor. I think he found in the parts book that it belonged 
&gt; to a 1970 1600 cc.
 
What is the 3 digit number on the arm of the vacuum unit?
[it is inside the dist]

What are all the numbers stamped into the body of the dist?
[the 10 digit Bosch number and the 9+ letter(s) VW numbers]
