&lt;&lt; Ahh.  Here's the rub.  SO-44 was the designation for the split window bus.
 
 The baywindow variant was labled (I think..) the so-67.  Frank and Cathy's
 Dor has this interior. &gt;&gt;

  Dave had it close,our Dormer has an so-69-1 setup.As Doc Ric can 
atest,there are several different variants of the so-69 interior. Ours the -1 
variant is a bench seat interior with closet behind driver. The stove, 
refrig, sink console next to that, behind the passenger. The jump seat sits 
behind the closet.Full width bed and dreaded blind spot cabinet in back. we 
really like the setup although it does get a bit cramped with the kids and 
all there stuff packed in.
