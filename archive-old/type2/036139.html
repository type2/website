Subject: &quot;1 of these lifters is doin' its own thing...&quot;

List,
So, i got the lifters: http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/VW.html
And they are solid - not hydraulic anyway.  The snapring holds a cap over,
well, space. They're hollow - which a solid lifter probably is too, but with
no removeable cap.  Don't seem to weigh much less than a std solid lifter. 
Only advantage i can see is that the cap, which is free to move around
laterally in the lifter might cause less wear on the pushrod? Might be
noisier... maybe they were cheaper to manuf?

Only thing bad is that the guy sent me 7 of these capped lifters, which are
new and one std solid lifter, which appears to have been run at least some -
it does pass the 'rock' test and is mostly black like the others.

Fat chance of this, but anyone know where i can find one (1) of these capped
solid type4 lifters new?

Any info appreciated

clark
