Subject: Painting Brake Calipers

The parts bus I now own has yielded a fine pair of brake calipers.  
Those with '71-72 buses know these are a two year only item and priced
accordingly.  Calipers I have tried to salvage in the past were not 
worth the time because the outside of the caliper itself had rusted 
extensively.  I bought new seals and was going to overhaul these and 
seal them up for later use.  I have been thinking of putting on a very
light coat of high-temp or regular paint to keep the outside from 
rusting.  Any thoughts on this?  I have never seen a painted caliper. 
I know they do get hot.  Thanks.  Jim
