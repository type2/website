&gt;    Some engine builders I know like AA cylinders (better them Mahle or 
&gt;Cofap) and accept their pistons for day to day
&gt;but not hi pro applications.
&gt;    For out of the box name brand, shop price I guess. None of my importers 
&gt;even stock 1700 P/L's anymore


Does that mean that the Cofaps would be like bottom of the scale in quality. 
These are for a stock engine and not a daily driver. Of course who builds an 
engine that is not Hi-Pro and not expect atleast Daily Driver durability. It 
sounds like I need to lean toward the AA or Mahle. But if it turns out to be 
that they are indeed Mahle would it make much difference to go with the 
Cofaps?

Thanks,
