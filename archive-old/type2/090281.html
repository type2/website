&gt; You might get lucky(by eye) and might not.

&gt; Find a socket in your set that &quot;just&quot; fits inside the splines on the
&gt; clutch disk.  Test fit it up against the flywheel for &quot;close&quot; fit
&gt; as well where the pilot bearing is.

I've said this before, but most people have a perfect VW clutch alignment
tool already.  It's a Mini-Mag-light AA flashlight.  You use the thin end
to align the disk, them use the fat end to illuminate the hole to check
your work.
