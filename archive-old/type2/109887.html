Subject: 20th (and last) Vintage Volkswagen Show

Jerry and Angela Coffin of J.A.C. Auto are holding their 20th and final 
Vintage Volkswagen Show at the shop on U.S. Highway 10 just north of the 
Anoka/Ramsey, Minnesota city line.  It will be this Saturday, 16 August, from 9:00am to 
3:00 pm.

This is open to all air-cooled VW.  There is an admission of $5 and there 
will be swappers.  I hope to find a rear side marker for my '72 since mine kind 
of shattered a couple of weeks ago.

If you need any more information you can call Jerry at 763-421-2705.

Brad
'72 Westy
Burnsville, Minnesota
