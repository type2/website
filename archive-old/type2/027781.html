I have a 74 Bus, 1800cc, pretty much stock except for the kadrons. When I 
went to do my first valve adjustment I found the notch in the back of the 
pulley, and there was already a white mark on the front side of it, i made 
the 2nd mark 180 degrees opposite of it and then set it to TDC. I then found 
the notch in the distributor where the #1 cylinder is supposed to fire, but 
the rotor was not lined up with it, and it wasn't 180 degrees off, instead 
was in the position to fire the #2 cylinder (as shown in muir for type 1, 2, 
and 4) So I have checked and checked again and read everything in the 
library about finding TDC and I have found it, but for some reason my #1 
cylinder spark plug wire is where the #2 is on all my diagrams and pics, so 
essentially it seems that all my wires were rotated counter clockwise one 
position, but if that was the case then my TDC would line up with #2. I hope 
someone can offer some help to let me know what is going and maybe why it's 
like this, I adjusted the valves this way and it seemed to run fine, but I 
still wonder if it is set up correctly.
Thanks,
Nathan
