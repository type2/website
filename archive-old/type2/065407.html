Subject: Owners Manual, '65

Thanks for all of the responses to my (and others) timing questions.  

Next question: Any clues on where to find the owner's manual for a 
'65 Panel Van?  I saw manuals for 60-64's at the VW show in San Jose 
this weekend (and later models), but not the '65.  Mostly I'm just 
curious, so it wouldn't have to be the orignal - is there anyplace 
that handles reprints?

Thanks,

Greg
