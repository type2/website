&gt;  Hi there!

 Hello!

&gt; ... Is there anybody out there
&gt; who tested if the Mercedes &quot;mini emergecy&quot; spare wheel fits over the brake
&gt; drums and the disk brakes on the bus?

 I'd also want to check that it would handle the load. I think these things are marginal for their intended use, they may be dangerously underspecified for a type-2.

Cheers,
              W.
