On 
&gt;   &gt;&gt;Problem #2 
&gt;   After driving long distances (200+ miles), the van will 
fail to start
&gt;   once the ignition is turned off.  I thought my starter 
may be getting
&gt;   too hot and tripping a &quot;breaker&quot; so I ran a wire 
directly from my
&gt;   battery to the starter.  The wire is connected to the 
starter and
&gt;   dangles loose near the battery.  When it will not start 
I have to use
&gt;   my&quot;hot wire&quot; to get it going how can this problem be 
fixed? Why does it
&gt;   occur? &lt;&lt;

I have occasionaly experienced this on my 65' bus do people 
think think is attributable to a faulty ignition, I have not 
tried the hot wire sol'n yet.
