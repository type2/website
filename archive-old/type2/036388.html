Hey Steven,

My wife and I just returned from a camping trip last weekend where we used
the Coleman Black Cat Heater.   We opened the slat windows a little (which
provided plenty of ventilation).  The heater did a great job keeping the bus
comfortable while it was about 34 degrees outside.  The one thing I did
notice was the significant condensation inside, especially on the windows
and the top.
