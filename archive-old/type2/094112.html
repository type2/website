&gt; Immediate problem is that the sliding door is hard to open from both outside
&gt; and inside. I removed the door panel and took a look. I did not see any
&gt; adjusting nut for the cable on my 1978 per suggestions on some previous posts.
&gt; Must only be for earlier years ?The problem seems to be in the front handle
&gt; mechanism. You can turn it almost all the way down before it even enages the
&gt; cable with any resistance. Is there some type of adjustment in the front
&gt; handle mechanism ? I did not take it apart yet.. hoping to get some ideas from
&gt; the list first ! How are you suppossed to adjust this on the 1978 model ?

In the type 2 library:

I'm sure someone knows exactly what this is.  From my own experience, my
door had not been opened for several years.  At first it was very stiff and
the handle had to go all the way down because the door didn't want to
&quot;spring&quot; open on it's own which it should do.  I lubricated it and worked it
and now it's back to normal.
