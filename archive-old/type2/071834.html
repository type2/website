Greetings All!

So I'm opening the engine compartment lid (70 Bus) to take a look at my 
distributor when the whole lid comes off the body in my hands.  My first 
thought was, &quot;Gee, it's not supposed to do this.&quot;  Then I looked at the 
hinges thinking that the hinge pin must be rusted and busted.  Imagine my 
surprise when I could find no hinge pin.  So what is the deal with these 
funky little hinges?  Nothing on them in any of the manuals.  Mine are not 
going together again in any sort of lasting way so can I get replacements 
without going to the salvage yard?  AND............  since my engine lid is 
pretty dinged up I might as well replace that too.  Any of the aftermarket 
guys carry this item?
