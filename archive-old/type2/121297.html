There's no fixed price for doing a procedure like this. PA Speedo has a form on their website they want you to fill in before you send your speedo in for calibration:

In order words they spend their time calibrating it to spec rather than driving it around to see if it's correct (that's up to you).

They can adjust the spring tension and change the magnet charge on the bench to adjust the speedo. Changing the odometer to match is a further expense.

My advice would be to switch over to a later model speedo and optionally alter the cosmetics to keep the stock look.
