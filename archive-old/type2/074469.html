Subject: block heater

Greetings,

Hey with all of this talk about using different oil in the winter time I was 
wondering if it might be worth it to install a block heater.  They have one 
for a type 2 (71-79) at www.cip1_dot_com for $24.23.  It sounds pretty good to 
me but I was wondering if anybody has had any experiences with this kind of 
setup and if you would recommend it.  Cause with the block heater couldn't 
you use the same oil all year round and then have the optimum viscosity 
level for both start up AND also when the engine has warmed up.  And if 
anybody is wondering they have them for type 1 engines too for $30.35 but 
are currently out of stock of those for the moment.  Plus if you order 
online they give you a 5% discount.

Just a side note, I have noticed that when people reply to posts they often 
times copy more than they need to.  I realize that it is nice to copy parts 
of the message for context purposes but it isn't necessary to copy the 
entire message.  Oh ya, please don't post the same thing twice.  I love the 
list and it is a great resource but sometimes the length of everything is a 
bit ridiculous.  Anyway thanks for reading all of this and thanks in advance 
to anybody who responds to my question.
