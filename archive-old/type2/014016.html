Subject: Re: [T2] lowering a bay-window bus


&gt;What methods do the custom bay drivers use for lowering their busses? I'm 
&gt;guessing adjustable front beams in the front.
&gt;
&gt;What about the rear?
&gt;
&gt;And while I'm asking, what about getting the Porsche wheel bolt pattern. Is 
&gt;there a way to do it without using spacers?
&gt;
&gt;

Rex:

Currently, the best way to lower your front end is to get an adjustable beam.  Wolfgang International is working on dropped spindles, but not very quickly.  If more people call to bug them, they may start actively working on them again.  Call them and ask for Steve.  I bought some adjustable spring plates for the rear end from the  Bus Boys.  I think they know more about bus suspensions than anybody.

As for the Porsche bolt pattern, there are 2 ways to go.  Use wheel adapters, or get your drums and rotors re-drilled.  Beware the adapters: they only work if you're using the 911 style 5-spoke rims.  They won't work if you use Porsche cookie cutters.
