Subject: Engine install followed by broken clutch cable - related?

Hi,

I set out this morning to drive to work in 10(F) degree weather. Got
about a 2 blocks from my house when my clutch gave out. Luckily I
manage to coast into a free parking spot. Quickly determine the break
is somewhere at the pedal end. Pull apart the linkage to discover a
well worn clevis pin and the holes in the cable end totally worn
through. Attempt to rebend the cable end things back in to hold onto
the pin. Have trouble reconnecting the cable at the wingnut end.
Freeze hands. Give up for now. Grab a buddy's spare car and go to
work. Order new pin and cable. Get out of work, get cable completely
reattached (hoping for it to hold up the two blocks back home). Get
in, put some pressure on the pedal. Cable pops out again. Decide no
temporary fix will work satisfactorily and give up and go home.

So, now while I await my new cable and pin I'm left to ponder. Could
the fact that I recently had the engine out of my bus be a
contributing factor in the cable's failure now?

peace
