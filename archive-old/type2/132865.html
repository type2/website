Subject: Right hand conversion

Hi 

Im beginning conversion of my 72 Campmobile (from driver to driver
showpiece) and wondered if there is a standard conversion kit to right-hand
drive?  Also, has anyone had direct experience with DuraLube in the Type 4
engine?  I know VW says no additives in the fuel, but it would seem that
something like DuraLube or Slick 50 could only improve things, am I right?

And thank you for answers to two questions I didnt have the chance to ask:
Meat Thermometer technology and carb cleaner.

Cheers,
