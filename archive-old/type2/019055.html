&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;   I recently checked my brakes and found that i dod indeed ne new ones soon,
&gt; but also found that i have really bad wear on the inside of my front tires. I
&gt; guess this is bad toe out. It doesnt pull to either side while driving or
&gt; breaking, so i figured that the alignment is fine.
&gt;   I have very little experience working with the front end of my bus other
&gt; than lubrication. I usually find myself laying under the rear. I know that
&gt; Muir speakes of adjustments to make, but is this for alignment, or somethin
&gt; else. Will my local Sears automotive have the computers to check it for me
&gt; and adjust it so, or is this a manual adjustment that i can do in my
&gt; driveway.  I really dont want to let some kid drive my bus, even if its only
&gt; for fifty feet to find that they cant do anything with it.

Matt:
Rather than a chain-store shop, I use an independent front-end alignment
place. These guys have state of the art equipment and also older manual
equipment for us &quot;special cases&quot;. And they do A LOT of &quot;special case&quot;
work: race cars, street rods, restored cars of all stripes. Sure, they
cost a bit more, but it's not out of line (no pun intended) with the
quality of their work.
