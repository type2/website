Subject: driving with no needle bearing...
Message-ID: &lt;19990628054850.11661.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Upon dropping the trans axle and checking out the Inner Workings, i found my 
problem...my needle bearing is no longer a single unit.  Moreover, it is in 
about 25 shrapnel-esque pieces.  Completely shot.

My question is this: Have i destroyed anything by driving about 100 miles 
with the bearing completely gone? It did not make any noise, although 
shifting was very difficult, and the engine seemed slightly belaboured.  Oil 
temps slightly higher than usual, but not much.

It's a long story, so i won't go into it, but to ease the puzzled faces and 
minds of the list members, i was in an emergency situation and did not have 
any viable alternatives other than to put the tranny back in without 
replacing the needle bearing.  Lots and lots of painful work i know, and 
lots and lots next weekend too...

Thanks,

justin
