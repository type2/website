&gt;Because of the bulkier heaterbox, the Type 4 engines are harder to play

&gt;up the cover while you insert a 2x4 between top of cover and body just
&gt;above the head- this prevents it from sliding up and leaving a gap.  If
&gt;it's too tight to use a brake tool, I have also levered a board or crowbar
&gt;against the heaterbox below while using it to push the clip up.
&gt;   Did you clean the lip in the valve cover completely if PO used gasket
&gt;cement?  Some do glue the gasket to the cover (never to the head) to
&gt;prevent it walking.  I hate scraping, so I use a film of greas to hold it
&gt;there while carefully tipping the cover over the head and feeling by
&gt;sliding it side to side that I am over the lip of the head.

One other thing - check to see if your covers are warped.  Set them on a
flat surface with the little tab hanging over the edge.  I discovered that
mine were warped a little, which I think helped them to leak.  Also, for
some reason, the ends of a couple of my rocker arms are cutting off chunks
of the cork gasket - it's as if the rocker arms are too near the edge of
the head or something.  Anyone else have this happen to them?
