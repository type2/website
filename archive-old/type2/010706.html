The problem i had with my bus was not the adjustment or any of that, but my 
pilot bearing. However, I did find in the process that the bracket on the 
trans for the end of my cable had a broken bolt. It sheered right off with 
all the pressure, but i fixed it with a tap and die set. Anyway, my first 
symptom was that i couldnt get it into first when it was running (pissed off 
bunches of people behind me at lights and stopsigns). Next i found that when 
i got to the top of first and depressed the clutch to shift, it felt like i 
only pushed the clutch half way in. I knew it was adjusted perfect now. Then 
i tried starting it in first gear with the clutch in. It would jump forward 
as if the pedal was only half way down still. I pulled the engine to find 
that my pilot bearing was shreaded inside the crankshaft. With the heat of an 
acetelyne torch and a hammer type bearing puller, it popped right out. I 
greased the new one up and slipped it in;  problem solved.
