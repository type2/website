Thanks everybody for the info on my mystery engine. Now, I have another
question. Did the 914 engine cases have the VW stamp on the bottom of them?
I'm trying to figure what distributor to use on this thing. It has  one
ending with 009. Where would I look to ID the heads? Thanks.

from ggm

a 914 head has three studs for the intake manifold, a Type IV head has 4
studs. you can see the studs (nutted) by crawling head first into the engine
compartment. or if you are lucky, you can open your engine compartment
access port and just look down.

To get the head number, you have to pop off the valve cover and work really
hard to see the numbers under the rocker arms. You should have a number
something like this 021.101.371S. not that number exactly, but that format

this is a wonderful site that has lots of info on VW engine heads
