Subject: Friday funny...

I've been saving this one all week!

Last Saturday I put some gas in a Bus and had one of those out-of-mind
experiences...unscrewed the gas cap, put it on the roof, put in the gas,
closed the gas door, paid the guy, drove off.

If you're thinking, &quot;hey, he forgot something!&quot; you are exactly right.

On Sunday night I went to the only open store in town to attempt to find
one...a Wal-Mart. They have a section they claim is auto stuff, right? Went
back there and strolled through every aisle; no gas caps. Maybe I missed
something; there's an associate, I'll ask him.

Asks the forgetful Bus pilot, &quot;do you sell gas caps?&quot;
Asks the Wal-Mart associate, &quot;what's a gas cap?&quot;
