Subject: CC'ing heads   

Hello,
I just got my cylinder heads back from the machine shop, dropped
seats on #1 cyl. Since I want to make it so I dont drop another
lowering compression is a must I figure.
I have been told that lowering the compression would help
with temps and and therefore the seat wont drop again.
After reading books and searching the type2 archive for
a few hours I'am still confused.

So here is what I am wanting to know;
Almost certain its stock set of pistons and cylinders
1) Is there a procedure some where besides the one I found in the    muir?
2) How many cc's is the standard cylinder sweep volume on
   a  2L engine? Or is there a some what easy way of measuring
   it my self?
3) In the muir procedure he talks about using a piece of plastic
   which he laid over the cylinder head. I'am I reading it wrong
   and you have to set the cylinder on top of the head and then
   stick the plastic thingy in there? A picture sure would have
   been nice ;)
4) What should I lower the compression too? What was the stock
   compression for a 2L 79' engine?

Any input is gratefully appreciated, since I am lost
Sorry for the large amount of questions
Hopefully by monday I'll have the engine back in!
I am excitement!!!
