the only solutions i know of to the dreaded moustache bar/ muffler clamp
conflict are:
A) cut off the ends of the offending exhaust assemblies and weld in a
section that goes either in front of or behind the bar - not always
possible, depending on equipment used.
B) grind down the flange on the 'stache bar to make adequate room. people
scream and say NOOOOOOOOOOO it weakens it, but i've never seen one fail
because of it. if worried, have a friend weld up some extra material around
this area. just don't let them build the flange back up again!!
