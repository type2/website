Howdy all. After a couple extra weeks of hassles, and printers being sick, and
everything, I finally have the rest of the shirts in. I'm off to the mountains
tonight for an early weekend, so I'm planning on sending them out the first of
next week. The new colors look really great. Anyway, be on the lookout next
week for them.
I'm still looking into that coffee cup thing. I'll post more as I get some
prices and such.
Anyway, happy early weekend!
