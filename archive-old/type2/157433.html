I assume you have the cover off the AFM...

Look at the two little wiper arms that make contact
with the circuit card.  They should not be bent and
should have good contact with the card over the entire
range of motion.

Is the wiper arm contact surface on the board in good
shape?  If it's worn or chipped that could be a
problem.  If necessary, you can redrill the board
mounting holes and carefully re-align the board to
allow the wipers to travel over a non-worn part of the
contact surface.


Reseal the cover with silicone when you are done.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
you seem to be describing the CO adjustment
prochedure...  haven't gotten
that far....   engine won't idle at all.  I moved the
flapper itself to
get idle not an adjustment.   how did it get out of
adjustment. passed my
last smog test with good numbers. so why would I need
now to adjust CO
level before I get the engine running?????
