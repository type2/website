Hi All,

I was recenty at a swap meet and picked up a box full of Hella foglights of
various types.

One set are round, about 6-7 inches in diameter, slim and have chrome bodies
and trim and came with yellow and chrome reflectors. The other set are
rectangles, approx. 6x3 inches with yellow lenses and black bodies.  All of
them and the spares have glass lenses with Hella stamped on them and appear
to be over or under bumper mounts..  The box also came with a bunch of green
wires and two relays and what looks like a terrible looking aftermarket
switch - like from Radio Shack or something.

Now the questions....

Would anybody know what years these might be from?
Was there a VW dealer foglight switch in the early '70's? What did it look
like?
What is the proper way to wire these up in my '70 westy, utilizing these
relays?
What are the proper mounting locations for these types of fog lights?

Any infromation would be great.

BTW, I paid $20.00 CAN for the box...ITH...  :)

Ciao
