Subject: RE: [T2] Rear shocks.

&gt; Been getting a banging sound coming
&gt; from the right rear of the camper ever since I brought
&gt; Kermit home.  Only happens when hitting a good bump in
&gt; the road.

Exact same symptoms here.  A close look revealed that the bolt that once held
the top end of the right-rear shock absorber in place had failed, and the top
end of the shock absorber was loose against the top of the wheel well.  Bought
new shocks anyway.  I probably should replace *all* of those bolts now...

- Miles
