&gt;So I am depressed because I really don't want to have to get a

&gt;Ten minutes later she comes up and handed me three pennies.  She says
&gt;&quot;It only costed three cents to get that thing off.&quot;  I turned over
&gt;the pennies and see this:

Those pennies are pretty mangled.  All I can say is that I'm not going to 
subject my case and thrust bearings to that kind of pressure.  Also the 
3-arm puller is not guaranteed to work - in my case it simply bent the tabs 
on the hub.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I would recommend you 
not make the situation worse by trying risky things like the penny trick.
