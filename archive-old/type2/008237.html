&gt; &gt;I question whether compression ratio changes should have anything
to do
&gt; &gt;with manifold vacuum. 
&gt; 
&gt; You're not the only one, but it seems pretty simple to me.  Higher
&gt; compression ratio = higher cylinder pressures, and when the throttle
is
&gt; closed the opposite of higher pressure translates into more &quot;suction&quot;
&gt; through the intake manifold.

Looking at it analytically (the only way I can since I don't have
instrumentation!) I can see how increased CR would affect vacuum.

During deceleration, the engine functions as an air pump, attempting
to pump air past the closed throttle butterfly, through the intake
valve, and out the exhaust valves.  The piston goes to TDC, valves
close, the piston goes to BDC and the intake valve opens.  Since air
can't get past the throttle butterfly, what you are measuring with the
vacuum guage is the absolute pressure within the cylinder.

Higher compression ratios mean that the combustion chamber volume is
smaller than lower compression ratios.  Remember that the compression
ratio is the ratio of the cylinder swept volume plus the combustion
chamber volume to the combustion chamber volume alone:

CR = (CSV+CCV)/CCV

If the combustion chamber volume is small, then a smaller amount of
air is expanded into the cylinder when the piston descends.  Since
there is less air there must be less absolute pressure, therefore more
vacuum.  
The vacuum value is the difference between atmospheric pressure and
absolute pressure in the intake manifold.
