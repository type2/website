Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator/voltage regulator problems, Now I have a new problem

I want to thank all those who replied back to me about my problem.  It
was the alternator.  One thing I did learn that I'll pass along is
that Advance Auto had a Chrysler Voltage regulator (V625 I believe)
that cross references to the VW regulator.  Now for my next problem.

The pulley was very stubborn coming off the old alternator.  I pried
on it some and used a pulley puller.  In getting it off the pulley got
alittle bent so now my belt does not stay on for very long. I tried to
straighten it but I believe that this is almost impossible.  It can't
be good for the alternator to have a bent pulley on it either.  The
pulley I need is for a 72-74 Bus.  Bus Boys is the only one to list
the part number for it, 021 903 109A, but also says NLA (no longer
available).  Does anyone know where I can get a straight pulley or
know of a replacement type? (like some old washing machine?) Does
anyone else have my type of luck, when fixing one problem, another
developes?  Any help with my pulley problem would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Kevin
