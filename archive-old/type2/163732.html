Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

&gt; I have read on the Samba from people with plenty of experience that it is 
&gt; their opinion that you should sound deaden against wind and road noise and 
&gt; rattles but leave your engine audible so you can hear if you have a problem, 
&gt; each to his own but I thought I would share this little piece of advice, if I 
&gt; deaden my engine compartment I will do it last, that way I will have quieted 
&gt; everything else and can hear the engine still even after trying to quiet it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
   N.B. II :
   Careful with the sound deadening/insulation...IIRC, there was a long photo
and text story of a bus that was &quot;treated&quot; in this way and ended up rusting
severely 'cuz the materials were &quot;holding water&quot; as Tom Waits would say... 
;-(
Anybody remember the site for the &quot;treated&quot; bus... ?-(
