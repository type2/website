Subject: Re: [T2] engine lid bracket

[...]

&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a ruler they could measure the bracket on the engine lid,
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; are restoring a 1972 and I put the bracket on it which I thought was from
&gt; &gt;
&gt; when we pulled it apart but the lid on the open position hits the rear door
&gt; &gt; and on closing the arm hits the engine compartment on its way down, please
&gt; &gt; help thanks Dylan
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Bracket?  It should be a spring steel piece that looks like a safety pin.
&gt; It
&gt; &gt;was the same from 64 to 79. From the bolt end on the lid to the clip
&gt; holding
&gt; &gt;it together on the bottom end, it is 10&quot; long. Only difference that changed
&gt; &gt;over the years were the rollers on the body. Early used 2 metal rollers,
&gt; late
&gt; &gt;bay used a nylon block.
&gt;
&gt; I had a similar problem when I took the spring steel piece from my '71 parts
&gt; bus to use in my '77. There is a difference in length of the spring piece
&gt; somewhere in those years. I got the correct length one (I now have a '74
&gt; parts bus!!!) and solved the problem.

 Richard,
Very strange that there is a length difference in yours. I measured my 77 and
it is 10&quot;. I measured my 66 and 67, both are 10&quot;. This is 255mm.
The only visable difference between them is the position of the clip to hold
the bottom end together. Early, it was around the back side. Late, it was at
the end.
Should be part # 211 827 401 to the end of 71 [211 2300 000] and 211 827 401A
from 72 up [212 2000 001].
The roller difference I mentioned earlier happened at a different time:
2 rollers were to vin # 214 2057 948
1 guide was from 214 2057 949.
Around mid-74.
