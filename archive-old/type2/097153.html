Subject: What's Involved: Converting 1.7/1.8 liter to 2.0 liter

Maybe someone out there who has rebuilt a 1.7 or 1.8 liter as a 2.0 liter
engine can answer these questions: Does the crankcase have to be machined to
accept larger cylinders? Replace the crankshaft with one that has a longer
stroke?

How about hydraulic lifters? Is a hydraulic camshaft needed? Or just hydraulic
lifters?

Valve sizes?

Anything else?
