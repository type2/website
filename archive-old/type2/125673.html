Subject: Re: [T2] how long are battery cables

Dave,

Your post mentioned &quot;I put one under the fi box and the other in the regular
place....double ground!&quot;  When I was cleaning up the connections on my
negative battery cable, it was connected to the body under the FI box... so,
what is the 'regular place' you talked about?  BTW, I have a '79 Westy
(federal)

Oh, another question... somewhere I read that one should only use the
correct negative cable so the analyzers work correctly - anyone have any
thoughts on this?  Not that I have an VW analyzer nor do I plan to get one
in the near future.

Thanks,

Wayne
