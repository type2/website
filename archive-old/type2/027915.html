Ok, for those of you who are running Loafs with a 1700cc (stock motor),
dual 34 ICT Webers, and 009 distributor; what size jets are you
running in your carbs??? These things are driving me crazy!! I just want
to drive my bus without hearing a pop, kick, or flatspot. Right now,
I am running 135 mains with 60 idles. I started with 130 mains and  52
idles (right out of the box) and the bus runs sluggishly and pops and
coughs all the time. I've even gone as far as to try different combinations
of these four jets; no luck. Now, with the higher jets, it still pops
and kicks on the low end of the RPM's (right when the gas is pressed)
but once the gas is pushed down more and the carbs are &quot;forced&quot; to work,
the bus kicks in and goes. Any idea??? I should have a set of 140 mains
coming in today. Hope this works.
  Any idea would be great!!!
