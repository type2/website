Sleep in the rear of the bus. You'll soak up a lot of good vibes from
being back there.

&gt;2.) The engine in it needs to be replaced, and I would ideally like to 
&gt;go toa larger 1700 engine.

Put in a good 1600 DP, and you will have all the power and reliability you
can ever desire.

Remember.........
Fast ain't cool
Air conditioning ain't cool.

Gliding down the road to your favorite camping spot, and sleeping in the
back of the bus after a hard day's worth of 55 MPH is KEWEL !
