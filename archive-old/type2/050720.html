Subject: [T2]front doors won't open
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi Volks,

The front doors on my 72 westy won't open from the outside.  I've noticed the latch on the door is stuck.  Has anyone had this problem?  If so, is it just the outsite or do I have to take the panel off the door(s) to completely fix this.

Note: doors WILL open from the inside, just not the outside.

Thanks,

Rae
Rudy the 72 westy
