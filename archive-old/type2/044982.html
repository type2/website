A great post Mike, and good info. I think it illustrates the necessity to
verify by actual measure  all specs and and follow up with experiment in
order to alter a stock engine. It takes a bit of real engineering and
testing to confirm a new harmony with an altered engine, even if that is
just a different non-stock distributor.

That's why I say, if you don't want problems, either keep it stock (as
originally engineered) or become an Neandereer and start confirming all
your 'better' specifications before assembly. And you write down the data
from your trial and error testing to home in on an engine tune that will
function for long life and not destroy itself the first long hot grade you
hit. 

If, rather, your working with disposable income on a hobby, do as you will,
and report your results.

I suggest in the instant case, no true solution can be had without
confirming and adjusting compression ratio, which requires motor and head
and cylinder removal. Remember also that balance counts big time in all
things to do with horizontally opposed engines, including balanced CR.
