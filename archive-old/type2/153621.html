Subject: Re: [T2] timing scale

Hello Richard,

    To find &quot;O&quot;, or TDC on your pulley you will need a piston stop, and TDC
marker. I made one from an old spark plug, by breaking out the porcelain and
welding in a rounded off bolt, but they are available from motor cycle shops
for a few bucks.
    Replace the number one spark plug with your stop. Either fashion a
pointer, or make an TDC alignment mark somewhere on the fan housing. Very
SLOWLY and carefully turn the engine over by hand until it hits the stop.
Using your alignment mark as a reference, put a temporary mark on your
pulley at this point. Now turn the engine over in the opposite direction
until it hits, make another mark on your pulley. Now measure between the two
marks, this is &quot;O&quot;, or TDC.

  i need one badly and was wondering how to measure where
&gt; the zero should be on the pully.  how many centimeters or inches would it
be
&gt; to the left of the timing knoch presuming the knotch is at twelve o'clock.
&gt; any tips on finding where the zero would be.   could someone tell me how
to
&gt; measure with a protractor or something to mark all of the places i need
like
&gt; the zero, 7.5btdc and so forth
