Hello Steve,

I wanted to thank you for you informative reply to my
oil breather question. It really cleared things up. Do
you think in cleaning it that I might lodge some of
the dried oil in the case? would that pose a problem?
I thought about using alittle wire brush on my dremal
tool to get down in there but I was afraid that the
dried resadue might get down into the case and cause
somme problems. What do you think?
Thanks!

&gt; change your oil more often and it'll stay clean
&gt; longer unless you only drive
&gt; short hops.
