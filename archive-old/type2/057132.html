&gt; I apologize for what may be a dumb question here, but I can't find an
&gt; answer in any references.  I'm trying to check the timing on our '81
&gt; Westy, 2.0 liter, and have no trouble finding the timing scale mounted
&gt; beside the pulley, but can't find a reference mark anywhere on the
&gt; pulley.  Where is the pulley mark and what does it look like?

The timing mark is a *very* slim groove on the front side (away from the 
timing scale) of the pulley.  It's so slender that if you pull off the 
pulley and look at it, you'd think all you were looking at was a place 
where someone make one pass at the pulley with a hacksaw.  Not like the 
big &quot;V&quot; groove marks you might have seen on other engines.

If I were you I would remove the pulley (not really too hard), clean it 
up real well and then highlight the &quot;mark&quot; with some white enamel paint.  
Otherwise you'll never be able to spot it while timing the car, unless 
you have a *much* better timing light than I do.

&gt; I'm checking the timing because the engine has recently been very
&gt; difficult to start when warm (starts great when cold).  I'm planning a
&gt; tuneup this weekend.

Go ahead and check the timing, and do all the other tune up stuff too, 
but the &quot;hard warm start&quot;, particularly when the engine runs OK afer it 
starts, is usually a sign of fuel pressure problems.
