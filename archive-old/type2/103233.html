Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Steering Boxes

Anymore info availible on this procedure?  My '71 box is feeling a little
sketchy, and I've replaced ball joints (helped!) and am going to do the
center pivot bushing as soon as it gets warmer, but I'd like to have 100%
solid steering, so this sounds like the hot tip.  Anyone? TIA!

&gt; &gt; I looked into the fitting of a later steering box into an early bay,
since
&gt; &gt; my box is iffy. Bus Boys tells me that everything fits except you have
to
&gt; &gt; drill 2 new holes through the frame for the box, which is not too hard.
You
&gt; &gt; need a later Pitman arm($5). I'm thinking about it. Tom
&gt;
&gt; The &quot;frame&quot; is a box of sheet metal.  The holes for the steering boxes
&gt; have tubes around the through-bolts welded to the sheet metal to carry the
&gt; compression loads of the bolts.  Not difficult, but harder than a &quot;drill
&gt; and fit&quot; process.
&gt;
&gt; Still, if it can be done, it should!  I don't hear of many worm-and-roller
&gt; boxes failing.
