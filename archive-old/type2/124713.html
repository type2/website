Subject: RE: bosch hot start relay

Hi Wes,

Was it a hotter than normal day? I have used this relay on my 71 for over 10
years and also have it mounted under the regulator. The only time I had the
fuse blow was on a really hot July day in Nevada.

| Yesterday my wife by mistake left the stereo on
| in &quot;Orbin&quot; for about 6 hours. I figured a good run
| across town today would be enough to charge the
| battery up. This was not the case. My wife had to
| phone me to come with the jumper cables for a jump.
| This worked and the wife was on her way to her next
| stop. I decided to follow just in case. So this time
| Orbin would not start again but with no click at all.
| I checked the 15a fuse on the hot start relay and it
| had blown. I've had this bosch hot start relay for
| about a year with no problems. I also have it mounted
| under my regulator inside my dry engine compartment.
| After installing the new fuse I had to jump Orbin
| off again. I thought the wife would be good to go so
| I went back home. A few hours after she got home she
| said she had to roll Orbin off each time she parked.
| So I go to driveway and try to start Orbin up with
| no go. Damn, another blown fuse. I swithed the fuse
| for a new one and he fired right up. Does anyone think
| that using jumper cables had anything to do with the
| fuses blowing?? TIA
