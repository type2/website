Subject: Re: [T2] Intro and Gas vs Mig

	A much slower method of welding aluminium
(suitble for prototypes but not for production)
is Lumiweld., invented a couple decades ago by a
joker in Florida.  It is ideal for the home
hobbyist, using only a simple LPG torch (no
oxygen or inert gas bottle).  It is really
brazing.  An untrained amateur can simply join
thick Al sheet and then test to destruction  -
the work broke before the weld, which is all you
can ask.  I can attest this is a simple &amp; cheap
way to weld Al.  The Lumiweld rods are not
expensive, and you probably have an LPG bottle
already; simple LPG torches are also not costly,
and that's all you need.

&gt;Actually, I've done quite a bit of aluminum welding with a mig - I
&gt;used to build livestock trailers for a living.  You use argon as a
&gt;shielding gas.  Apparently helium can be used as well but, I don't
&gt;have any experience with it.  Aluminum welds very cleanly with no
&gt;splatter if your machine is set up properly.
