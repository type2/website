Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking pushrod tube

David Whiteley sends:

&gt; Now I've been told that they all leak! But surely, those nice guys at VW would
&gt; have designed a decent engine. It's only over here in the UK that we designed
&gt; engines with bulil in oil leaks!
&gt; 
&gt; My problem is a leaking pushrod tube. I know that I should take off the wheel
&gt; ,the rocker cover, the rockers  etc etc. and change the seal.
&gt; 
&gt; Would I be able to get away with a bit of gunk of some sort around the outside
&gt; of the tube?
&gt; 
&gt; OR Do thay in fact ALL leak anyway?

My Bug doesn't leak. Most VWs do, though, and it's lack of maintenance that
makes them that way. The lack can be very slight, and they'll start to leak.
Nature of the beast.

I think I know why VWs start leaking so easily: It's so you'll put fresh oil
in them. Motor oil was once expensive in Germany because of wartime
reparations, which meant people wouldn't change it like they should. At the
same time, oil picks up combustion products and bearing crud, so you don't
want to leave it in there forever. What to do? Let's make it leak! If it
leaks, eventually enough oil will run out that you'll need to put in some
fresh.

Laugh not--our Akiyama printing presses are specially designed to leak oil
and for just that reason. They even have the leakage rate in the manual so
you can calculate oil usage, and the plans for the tray you set the press in
so the leaking oil doesn't escape into the groundwater.
