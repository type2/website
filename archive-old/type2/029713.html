&gt; listees! i am considering buying a bay where the owner can't find the title

&gt; there a way around this, like a duplicate title that can be picked up in
&gt; one day at the dmv? i am trying to prevent a case of the sketchies, and
&gt; being able to get a clean slip in oregon as easily as usual. is going

Your best bet is to call the DMV (or AAA if you're a member).  Don't let
your money change hands until the paperwork is right!  It's the owner's
responsibility to get it right, and if you make the deal dependent upon
the paper it will motivate the owner to do the right thing.
