&gt; Be grateful that 'stuff' is still available for your

&gt; Moss Motors (Sorta the &quot;Sears Roebuck&quot; of
&gt; orphaned British cars)...Those kingpins are not
&gt; easy to replace (again), nor are they cheap...

&gt; BTW, those air defectors at the corners of the
&gt; Bus dashboard, Jags have them too; $200 a pop.

All true but not very helpful. I'm sure the Austin-Healey and Jensen folks
shake their fists at us as their lists overflow with messages stating how
lucky they are to be paying $200 for a piece of small plastic compared to
those poor Tucker or Model-T folks.

I'll rephrase my question: do new mounts exist with two different bolt
patterns or will I be forced to drill more holes.
