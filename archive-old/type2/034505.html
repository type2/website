Subject: torque.. long

&lt;&lt;&lt;That's the question - how do I do this properly?  I have Muir and
Bentley so I have the diagram for the sequence.  Should I loosen all
the
nuts first and then go through the torque sequence? Or should I just
go
through the sequence with out loosening the nuts?  Or should I do
something else?  And finally, how often should this be done?  I
replaced
the heads, pistons and cylinders on the engine 5 or 10 thousand miles
ago.  I think I should have re-torqued the heads before this but is
there a recommended interval for this procedure throughout the life of
the engine?  Will these questions never end? ;)&gt;&gt;&gt;

here is my take on the subject..i will try to be brief!!

loosen the nuts and start from scratch.  the sequence is given, with
the assumption you have not torqued them yet.  ESPECIALLY since i
personally believe it is not a real bright thing to do to only torque
the bottom 4.  this makes NO sense to me.  

when you re-torque..obviously you don't loosen them all at that time.
(because this time they were all torqued in sequence correctly)!!!  
just put on the torque wrench and check to make sure they are right
on.

**side note.  to those of you who have higher performance engines, you
might want to read some of gene bergs material on increasing torque
values to prolong engine life.(the below mentioned things i have done
to BOTH 1600 dp and type iv bus motors).  personally i have raised the
6 main studs on the case 10 LBS.!!!!  the outer case sealing nuts
5lbs!! and the heads 5-10 lbs (depending on the application of the
motor)....never has a stud pulled on me.  i once took some old cases
that were cracked, split or where a rod blew threw...and tested how
far i could torque b4 a stud pulled.  the six main studs consistently
torqued to 50 + lbs some were much higher.  i do not claim to know all
the physics of the implications of this...but i could go into details
of my personal experiences on how I THINK this has helps my motors. 
all of bergs motors get it done.  (and whether you agree with all the
companies practices...most agree they only sell stuff that works and
stand by their ideas).  just a thought.

back to the subject...most say to re-torque after 5-10k.  i would
really like to hear from a vw guy and learn what they used to
recommend from the factory.  about 50/50 of the time i have done it. 
and in those times i retorqed (checked) all the nuts.

any other thoughts folks??
