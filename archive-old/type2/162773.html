John,

I haven't heard anyone on the list talk about these being available.

Did I miss it!?  Vanagons, yes, but nealy all of us with bays could use a 
new one.

Name names!  Tell us where!

Cheers, dave

&gt; You know which brings up an obvious question, where are the
  repro ones now available coming from, and of what level of
quality are they?  Both the 74-75 and 76-79 now seem to be
available, for about $40, has anyone used one?
