&gt; I tend to agree with David on this one. Harl*y Davids*n did this exact
&gt; thing some 10 years ago(and still are). They have copy righted there brand
&gt; names, model names, certain names of parts;ape hanger(handlebars),
&gt; hardtail/softail(frames), fat bobs(gas tanks), brand nickname:Hog,Hawg,
&gt; they have even gone so far as to try and trademark their engine sound!!

They lost on this one, though.  Kind of ironic that they consider a rough
idle to be such a valuable thing!

&gt; Several parts dealer had to change their shop names if it used any of the
&gt; trade marked names. Any parts or accessory that said the above mentioned
&gt; names had to be &quot;Licensed&quot; from the Motor Co. like tank name plates,
&gt; reproed decals, t-shirts etc.

And boy do they license!  Everything from beer to telephones to cheap
plastic scooters for the kiddies.  All available at the Harley
Boutique[tm] or local wallyworld!

Jeep[tm] does pretty much the same thing.  They came around about a year
ago and made a bunch of shops change their names.  I watched an episode of
&quot;junkyard wars&quot; where they referred to a Suzuki Samurai as a &quot;Jeep&quot;
throughout and imagined the letter that the producers were going to get
from DaimlerChryslerEtc[tm]!
