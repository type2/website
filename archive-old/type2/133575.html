Subject: Re: [T2] how long are battery cables

I been thinking of putting new cables on my batteries and was wondering
before heading off to the FLAPS,  how long are the plus and neg cables
from battery to starter/ground.   sure I could measure em, but I thought
maybe someone might have the number off the tops of their head.


thanks
Bob
