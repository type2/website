&gt;
&gt; &gt;Before I go on, Thomas Tarka's post about his 009 is prompting me to
write
&gt; this&gt;snip&lt;Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  I don't get it,
&gt;
&gt; I don't get it either, but from the other direction. I am running an 009
on
&gt; my 74 1.8ltr and it does quite well. Good power and acceleration, no
&gt; unexpected trouble on hills, etc, etc. I am planning to re-install the
stock
&gt; vacuum dizzy after I repair my carb to make a comparison, so maybe then
I'll
&gt; understand.
&gt;
&gt; My thinking is that while the 009 may not be perfect, I have never failed
to
&gt; get an air cooled VW to run with one. Can't say the same for the vacuum
&gt; dizzies, but my experience may be somewhat limited.
&gt;
&gt; My two kroner worth.
