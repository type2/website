&gt;That's what I was concerned about. I dont know if the &gt;fuel pressure is different on these two engines.

fuel pressure for 75-79 stock fi buses:

22-23psi minimum
28 psi happy
35 high end
(right gang?)

&gt;Since the vacuum line runs directly to the
&gt;fuel pressure reg. I thought it might cause some &gt;difference in the air/fuel ratio. Guess I'll find out.

If you look at the numbers above and consider just how bad some f.i. busses are running out there and still getting people around, you'll realize the bosch L-Jet system is does pretty well in the old cost/reliability ratio. If you got your unit off a 75-79 bus, I wouldn't worry.
