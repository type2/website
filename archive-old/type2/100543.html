Subject: Stranded - Bad Starter? HELP!

Hi Folks,

Although my Christmas was a good one, my post-Christmas has not been so 
great.  After a great trip from Asheville to Boston to visit my parents, I 
got ready to pack and go, only to find that my Bus doesn't start!  It's a 
1979 2.0 FI Westy, and it has been running perfectly until this morning.  We 
had a lot of rain/moisture yesterday, and the temperature dropped to about 
20F, and now we're buried under about 8&quot; of snow.  I think the solenoid may 
be frozen, but I heated it and still had no luck.

Symptoms: Key in, turn to Start, no sound.  Voltage is at 12v, idiot lights 
go on, but nothing - not even a click - from the starter.  I bridged across 
the starter terminals, and the starter runs (whizzzz!), but it doesn't 
engage the flywheel.  I heated the starter and solenoid with a torch to 
un-freeze anything that might be frozen, but still had the same results - no 
luck.

Questions: Is the solenoid bad?  Is the starter bad?  Is the wiring bad?  
Should the starter engage and start the engine if I bridge across the 
starter terminals?  Is there anybody in the greater Boston area that has a 
good starter for cheap?  Can I replace the starter with the engine and trans 
in the car?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
