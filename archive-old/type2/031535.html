&gt; higher stresses, and the oil would have a preponderence of breaking down
&gt; sooner, thus the need for a higer visosity oil----right?
&gt; I read the owners manual, and it says to use straight 40w oil but with
&gt; new technology in oils, I figured that the 15-50 would be OK.

I use 5W-50 synthetic year round

&gt; What kind of oil pressures are these engines running?
&gt; At 65,mph, my oil pressure is at 55 psi----OK?
&gt; When in town, it is at 40psi.

sounds pretty good

&gt;  What constant cruising speed is safe for these vans?
&gt; I ran it at 70 on the way home the week-end before last when I picked it

more than I would drive but not because of the engine, but around here the
top speed limit is 65 and the radar cops are everywhere

&gt; The oil temp was at about  250 degrees for most of the trip.

that seems hot to me, I try not to get over 230, at 240 I slow down to
about 55-60 which seems to be where mine runs coolest, at 250 I pull over
under a tree, open the rear door and let in idle til it cools down

&gt; 
&gt; And now for the last question.
&gt; The bus has 185x14 Michelins on it.
&gt; The load rating is 1450 lbs, _at_ 40 psi.

sounds marginal don't over load the van or your tires will be overloaded

&gt; I checked the tire pressure, and they were all at 32 psi, so I jacked
&gt; them up to 34 psi.
&gt; I don't want a rock-hard, bang, bang, bang ride, but I want the tires to
&gt; function properly.
&gt; Is this air pressure OK?

I would use the recomended, it won't ride hard

&gt; And while talkig about tires, I want to increase the size of the tire
&gt; for a better ride, and handling.
&gt; How big of a tire can I put on it?
&gt; 205's, 225's ?


I have found 205/70R14 to be as big as you can go without hitting the
wheelwells (stock)  I run Michelin MXT's (now call Agilis) they have a
99S rating (1980lbs) so there is plenty of overload capability, however
these buggers are expensive, about $140 per (balanced, new valve, old tire
disposal, tax etc included) and they were special order only, got mine
from NTB.  they are M&amp;S rated so they are ok in the snow, not real
agresive but adequate for most use, usually get 65,000+ on the rear and
80,000+ on the front
