Subject: Caliper repair help

Remember the problem I had with the rotated piston in my caliper, well I've
actually got two and it's one in each caliper. Hmhm!

I can't move them at all and it looks like the seal has a super firm grip on
the piston.

I don't have a seal kit to do a complete repair as I have to go on a trip
but I'd still like to rotate it in the meantime to get the backing plate in
right.  This is what I want to do.

1. Remove one pad
2. Push the piston out a little with the brake pedal
3. Remove the caliper from the hub
4. Use a pair of channel locks to try to rotate the piston without damaging
the machined surfaces
5. Put in back on the hub and bang it in with a piece of wood
6. Bleed.

Does this sound right?  Rotating this thing is a pain.
