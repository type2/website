Subject: [T2] Dormobile question

I have a 71 Dormi' and have a question regarding the electric hook-up that
one might use in a campsite/caravan park.
Does this power my otherwise gas powered fridge....is there any way of
checking. Also, as I have never used this before, I assume it powers lights,
stereo etc and there is no need to worry about killing my battery........is
this possible to check via the amount of leads to the battery ?
All sounds a bit vague, but am going away soon and need to check it out.
