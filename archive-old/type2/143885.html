&gt; Adam, I'm sure you're a lucky guy to have her but she is not any
&gt; form of indicator.  She is, instead your copilot/navigator.

If the bus were a ship, she'd be the &quot;Captain&quot;.  You would be the
&quot;Helmsman&quot;.  She tells you what she wants done, you manipulate the
controls to make it happen.
