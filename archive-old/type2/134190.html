Subject: RE: [T2] to install thermostat? yes - no - maybe

So what is the remedy for the mayonnaise syndrome?  I don't drive my '79
westy too much in the winter; however, I do notice the mayo on the valve
covers or oil cap the few times I drive to the coast in the winter and
decide to check/adjust my valves for the 600 mile ride home.  I don't
see these symptoms in the summer.  Whad up with that?
