Subject: Vehicle Visibility and Safety Idea (Was Towing a Campermobile
  with a Vanagon)

Hi friends:

As the last step in the painting and bodywork on my '73 Campmobile, I have
ordered 1/2&quot; wide white 3M Scotchlite reflective tape (The stuff that you
see in other colours on commercial trucks, ambulances, police cars, ect),
to
replace the chipped shiny aluminium(?) trim strip that runs around the bus
under the windows. I did a tester, and the tape looks good during the day,
not too far from stock, but is amazingly bright at night. A 50 ft roll (
about 37 ft is required) is about $50 CAD ($35 US).

Cheers,
Matthew
