Subject: one last [really!] question about the ignition relay thing:

Greetings all:

After I had the mysterious breakdown following putting the relay in a few 
days ago, I found that the inline fuse was blown, so I replaced it [by 
accident, I replaced the 15A fuse with a 20A one--it was dark under there].
I've had no more ugly symptoms, for whatever that's worth.

My question is this, though: Am I really that much better off with the
fuse in that circuit, compared to all the people who wired a relay in
themselves with no fuse?  Or was Bosch just showing off?  None of the
descriptions of do-it-yourself relay installations archived around the
place mentions a fuse.  And several list members expressed some surprise
at hearing about the fuse in the first place. 

Two appointments were cancelled today, so, inspired by descriptions
herein, I got the polishing compound and the soap and brush and wax out
and gave the bus the treatment.  Quite a difference, although starting
with the polishing compound is like disturbing the dust in your living
room [or mine, at least]: You're quickly committed to doing the whole
thing whether you really feel like it or not. 

I also tried to replace the wiring on a tail light far enough back to get 
rid of the short, but apparently failed.  Also discovered that the socket 
assembly itself is pretty well shot, so I'll be looking for one of those 
soon [RMMW and JCW didn't seem to list them--?]

One last near-horror story: While fiddling under the bus with the starter
business, I just happened to look over at the CV joint, and realized that
one of the allen head bolts around its edge was so loose I could twirl it
in and out with my fingers.  I think only the grease and road grime had
held it in.  I tightened it and checked them all.  ObVWKarma: The reason I
had the allen wrenches to fix this was because a set of them [and some
bolt cutters] was left in my Honda by the people who stole it the first
time.  Go fig.
