Subject: RE: --- where are you living??? ---

I think John-Baptiste's idea of an interactive map of N America showing where
you all live is a good one. His web site is already good and this is something
I've not seen else where.

But do we all need to be posted on this? 400 mails saying where someone lives
takes a lot of time even if we just delete them.

I consider you all my interactive friends and don't want to upset anyone but
would it not be better to mail John-Baptiste direct.

His Email address is      jblp_at_zone_dot_ca

Good luck with the map John.

Bob

P.S.
Please don't mail me telling me I'm a boring old f**t over this, I already 
know I am, and I don't want another load of extra mail tomorrow :-)
