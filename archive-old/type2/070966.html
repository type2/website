&gt;  I wanted to remove the Fuel Tank filter screen and see how much crap was

Hi Shawn and fellow listees,

This is my experience when I did this on my now departed '73.

SAFETY WARNING - petrol is highly flamable/explosive - do this procedure out
doors, away from any other cars/your house, remove all sources of ignition
&gt;from the locality, disconnect the battery, have a bucket(s) of water and a
hose pipe ready to put out fires wash away spilages etc etc - 'nuf said eh?

An assistant will be useful as you will be under the bus and need to pass
stuff out. 

1. Let the petrol get as low as you dare in the tank.

2. Clamp the line out of the petrol tank hard. eg use a pair of long nosed
vice grips, this will give a quick release clamp useful in draining the rest
of the fuel.
clamp the fuel line again a short distance further away from the tank

3. Cut the fuel line BETWEEN the two clamps. Small amount of fuel (ie what was
in the pipe between the clamps) will come out. Do your best to catch it in a
container eg clean bucket; but don't let it spill on your self.

4. take the filler cap off to allow a free air supply into the tank.

5. Use your bucket to catch the out flow as you release the clamp on the fuel
line dangling from the bottom of the tank. Transfer fuel to a secure container
and repeat until tank is empty.

6. release the second clamp and drain fuel back from the pump, and carb(s)/FI.
Put this clamp back as its not that easy to drain this side and it will
otherwise drip for some time.

7. Undo the nut at the bottom of the tank . (put bucket underneath to catch
drips)

8. Now you have a nut and short length of hose attached to a sort metal tube
with flange in the middle. separate parts, discard hose.

9. now back underneath look at the threaded bit sticking out of the tank. The
screen you want to remove is like a finger and it has a small flange at the
bottom which as it is the same diameter as the threaded bit and only about 1mm
thick is not easy to see. Use a finger nail or a blunt knife to ease this down
the first bit until you can pull it straight out.
Of course if there was gunge in the bottom of the tank it's a this point more
fuel (and possibly gunge) will come out so one again have you bucket ready.

11. If the gauze is clear then the tank may be considered 'gunge free'. If its
fouled then you will need to remove the tank to clean it out :-(

12. Assembly is as they say a reverse of disassembly You will of course use
some petrol resistant thread sealer (available from your local auto parts
store) when you replace the nut, all new hose clamps, new hose, new fuel
filter etc etc. With the tank empty its a real good time to renew the fuel
lines from tank to carb/FI completely.

13. put removed fuel back in tank. Check for leaks.

14. reconnect battery If you have FI with a catalytic converter goto to step
16.

15. OK you dont have a cat so you don't mind some unburnt fuel going into the
exhaust. So remove the HT lead from the coil to distributor. Get assistant to
crank engine while you check for leaks in the engine bay particularly on the
pressurised side of the pump. Put the HT lead back.

16. Fire up the engine check for leaks in the engine bay with engine running.

17. Take a spin around the block and fill up with petrol. On arival back home
check for leaks again - use touch and smell your fingers to detect petrol
soaking into the braiding at the ends of inadequately clamped fuel lines.

18. Have a cup of coffee / tin of beer.

The procedure is not difficult just work steadily and carefully taking your
safety from fire and getting soaked with petrol seriously.

Good luck
