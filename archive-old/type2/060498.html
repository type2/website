Y'all,

 but does 
anyone have antenna alternatives?

&lt;&lt;On a Bay Window install an antenna that
is imbedded in a clear strip that you install
right on the glass, inside,,,,or try a inductively coupled
antenna that you stick to the glass on the outside
and then stick the receptor on the inside. Goes through
the glass via the same magic (kinda) that gives you
radio reception.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me. What a long strange trip it's been!
