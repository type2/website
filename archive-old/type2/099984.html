Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

If in fact you guys are looking for a relay set up I have dual 40 amp
Hella relays all wired up --just connect them to a ground, hot terminal,
and the high and low beam circuit off the dimmer switch.
The existing fuses in the fuse box will take care of any problems, if
they do arise.

They work out real nice in my Vanagon's, and I never thought about doing
the same in my 74---good idea !!

Later,

Terry

Its really worth it to install relays and run power directly from the
generator or battery. You lose a lot of power when its routed through
the light switch. It makes a difference even if you're running
conventional lights. Daniel Stern Lighting http://lighting.mbz_dot_org/
sells relay kits and lights if you don't want to assemble the few parts
yourself.
I agree on this one. Running relays will also save your headlight
switch, since it will no longer have to carry the full headlight current
Make sure that the new current-carrying wires are fused, preferably with
self-resetting circuit breakers. It's a very good idea to run separate
left and right feeds to the headlights, so the failure of one will not
leave you completely in the dark.
