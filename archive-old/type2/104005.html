Subject: Compressed Air Engine was Electric Engine

just for the reading here are some links:

Here you can see it keep the piston like design:

Maybe it could be a great idea to use this kind of engine in a beetle, but i
doubt it could push a baywindows.

At second thought its a great idea.  When stuck in traffic your engine stop,
no noise, push the acceletor to move and here is sooe air going through your
piston !!  Use Mazola oil as  engine oil so you can stop  somewhere and make
french frie ha ha ha!!!

For the fancy one instead of normal compressedair you could use pure Oxygen ,
or laugh gas ...when stuck in traffic everybody around will laugh!! :)

And the final word... it will still be an AICOOLED ENGINE !!!
