&lt;&lt; &lt;I was curious a while back and set off a plumber's smoke bomb under the
Bus and drove it off.&gt;

My plumber never used one of these. Is this a NJ thing?


Theodore Reshetiloff &gt;&gt;

The Sopranos are a NJ 'thing'; plumber's smoke bombs are available at bet-
ter pumbing supply houses... used to test ducting and piping for leaks with-
out the possibility of damage from an actual water test. Couple of ways to
use 'em...Set 'em off where a small compressor will suck the smoke in and 
force it through a duct or pipe system. If there's any leaks in the system,
the escaping smoke is easy to see and repair. Especially nice if it's a sweat-
ed joint as you don't hafta drain any water back to fix it... ;-)
