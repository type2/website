Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

Put it on the floor behind the front seat aiming backwards or between the 
front seats.

There is not much heat / any heat behind the heater or side to side.


&gt;The Mr. Heater unit has very high ratings on Amazon but it being a radiant 
&gt;heater I wasn't sure that it would be OK in the close quarters of a 
&gt;bus--that the radiant element might melt something or blister the veneer 
&gt;off the Westie table. Is that a concern? Where in your bus do you put it?

But yes your concerns are valid. If this heater did not turn off 
automatically with each jostle I would not run it while I was rolling down 
the road for this reason alone. It could slide across the floor and set 
something on fire or your packages could slide too close and get set on fire.

For heating while stationary I think this heater will be A+. Unfortunately 
my bus is still in it's project stage so I can't comment further.
