Dear Listees,

I posted my 71 Weekender for sale in the #395 and #397 Digests. I listed it
for $4300. Due to a slow response, I've decided to lower the asking price
for listees to $3500. If you are interested, consult the previous Digests.
If you've deleted them, write or call me and I'll fill you in on the
details. Thanks.
