Subject: Re: [T2] RE: AC Delco Alternator

&gt; Not to mention cooling arrangements? mounting? wiring? Delco alternators
&gt; have different working principles/testing methods than the stock Bosch.

Hmmm... different operating principles? I don't think I've ever seen an
alternator that didn't have a pulley on one end that made the magnets inside
rotate inside of a wire coil, creating an electric current. On the backside is
ususually some kind of connection for a voltage regulator unless the
alternator has an integrated regulator. And then there are two other
connections: a ground and a positive providing between 13V and 14.5V
(depending on the voltage regulator) at somewhere between zero and the rated
number of amps.

Did you know that starters are almost identical in design? The just work
backwords. You connect a power source to one side and the wire coil creates a
magnetic field that makes the magnets on the axle turn - and whatever is
attached to the axle starts to turn.

What I would like to know, however, is just what is the difference between an
alternator and a generator?

As far as the operating environment, pretty much all cars are rather hot in
the engine compartment. It is my opinion (after having to change mine a few
times) that the Type IV alternator is in a bad location. But it would be a
natural to change to a cheaper, higher output alternator if you are converting
to a 911 style cooling fan. However, you would need to be careful because most
alternators don't have bearings than can handle the stress of a fan attached
to the end.

Why not modify an AC mount to take an alternator?

-Eric

P.S. Some of the auto manufacturers are experimenting with using a
starter/generator to elminate the extra part.
