Subject: Re: [T2] Smooth side up or down?

catch 22
&gt; When installing the big long soft rubber engine seal
&gt; around the motor 
&gt; (around the outside along the engine tin). Does the
&gt; smooth side face up or 
&gt; down? If I recall correctly it should be down.
&gt; 
&gt; 
Phil, You just hit on one of the catch 22 items. I put
mine in shinney side up, or down, don't think it makes
any difference which way it is installed as long as it
is there. Phil Cain
