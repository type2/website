Subject: Anyone going to the Great Blue Heron Music Fest (Jamestown NY)?

Importance: Normal

We go ever year, usually a fair number of busses/Vanagons there. It's this
Friday thru Sunday, near Lake Erie in Jamestown, NY.  Sprawling grounds,
swimming lake, tons of great music (huge variety; folk, rock, bluegrass,
zydeco, international, you name it).  Kids activities, too.  Details at
http://www.greatblueheron_dot_com/ .  If you're remotely near the area I highly
recommend the festival; if you go one year you'll want yo go back every
year.  We drive 7-8 hours (each way) to get there and it's worth the trip.
(If you miss this one, there's always the Grassroots Music Festival near
Ithaca NY a couple of weekends later, similar but more crowded;
http://www.grassrootsfest_dot_org/ ).

If you go, look for us in the lower vehicle camping lot (bottom of the hill,
across the lake from the festival).  We'll have Four Vanagons (3 of them
blue Westies) parked in a square with side tents on them.
