Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Drive Shaft is Stuck - How to Remove?

Most of the standard VW mail order parts supply places have a tool called a
&quot;distributor drive shaft puller. It is kind of expensive but will definitely
work if you don't have success with other methods. The nearest parts catalog
that I have within reach right now is RMMW and their part # is 30296 for
$42.95. I would check other places as you can probably beat that price. Also
when you are ready to pull it, coat the wall of the drive shaft hole liberally
with oil. I thought mine was really stuck but the oil made a big difference in
getting it out.

Good luck,
Bill Moon
