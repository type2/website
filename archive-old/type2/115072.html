&gt; I
&gt; am pretty sure that this is the source of my vac leak because as I moved it

&gt; Do I need to replace this to have my bus idling properly again?  I dont
&gt; know if the egr filter set up I see in Bentley was there before I bought
&gt; her. I dont have to worry about emission testing.

You bet. It's supposed to be a closed system that injects oxygen depleted
exhaust into the intake (except at idle or WOT). If it's a problem at idle
then something is loose or misadjusted (on that model the valve is
controlled by an electrical switch and vacuum hose).

If there is no filter present, you will have a giant vacuum leak because the
air coming in has not been metered by the AFM and the bus will run lean to
the point of stalling as you experienced.

You either need to make sure it's working correctly and add a filter or
remove everything and block the port on the exhaust and the opening on the
air plenum for the pipe:
