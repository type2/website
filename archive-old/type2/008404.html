A couple of people have asked about license lights and weren't sure of 
the year split.
There is a difference in the length. Early is short, late is long...but 
not by much.

Early is marked SAE L68 on one end and Hella 12936 on the other. The 
length from screw hole to screw hole is 130mm.

Late is marked SAE L71 on one end and Hella 12982 R4 on the other. 
The length is 140mm from hole to hole.

I don't know when the year change was but I would guess 71 since the 
late one is dated 71, but that is never gospel.

The best I can suggest is to measure: early 130, late 140.
