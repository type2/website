Subject: Body seam question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10104112006300.98170-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Volks,

So anyhow, Chris and I were talking in the type2 chat room [1], and the
subject of body differences came up [2]  One of the things that I *swear*
I have seen, but very rarely, are buses constructed with a one-piece
driver's side panel.  That is, there is no seam at the rear of where the
sliding dor would be if it were a double-door bus.  I know that the basic
chassis design allows buses to be assembled with left or right hand drive
and also left or right hand sliding doors (or both).

What I want to know is, were any buses produced that did *not* have
provision for an off-side sliding door? That is, a continuous panel from
the B pilar back to the rear corner. Was it certain years? certain models?
If you have a bus without this seam, please let me know.

can't prove it!!!  Next I see one I am gonna take a *slew* of pictures!!!
