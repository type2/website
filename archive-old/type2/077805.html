Subject: Emissions parts vs. non-Emissions


I have a '78 camper and was wondering what was added to California models
for emissions control.  I've seen a part for a catalytic converter and I've
heard that the gas tank is different.

Two questions:

1) Can the converter be bolted onto the non-emissions exhaust?

2) What's different about the gas tank?
