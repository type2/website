Subject: Main Engine Seal

Body work is done on Casper.
Final paint to be applied soon.

Getting ready to install engine back into the all freshly painted engine 
compartment, and want to ask .................

Main engine seal has leaked on me on two separate occasions.

I am checking very closely the parameters that might cause this, but on the 
chance that it might actually be the seal, itself...

What are the various sources of specific manufacture for seals as to brand 
name and quality?

If I have my choice as to a selected source of manufacture what specific 
brand name should I ask for to ensure highest quality?

BTW,
If you would like to see Casper's body work results before I manage to get 
them web page posted, send me an E-mail and I will zip a few together as a 
single file and send them to your p-mail address.
