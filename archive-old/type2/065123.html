Subject: Help to finish Aux.Batt  wiring diagram in Westy 79

Hey Everybody,

after asking many poeple around without much result
I decided to draw the wiring diagram for the 
auxiliary battery. There are some ??? where I am not totally sure of the
connection (the PO disconnected everything, I think after
the metldown of one of the wire...).

If somebody has a original connection to the auxilairy battery,
and wouldn't mind having alook at my diagram and see if it 
looks right (the part I am not sure is the relay to main battery 
and the black wire out of th relay, the one not going to the aux.batt.)

I could then leave the diagram for anybody who needs it
or archive it soemhwere as the question of these connection arizez
from time to time.

you can find the diagram at

http://qso.lanl_dot_gov/~laf/vw.html

Hope somebody can illuminate me
(before i get illuminated by a wrong connection!)
