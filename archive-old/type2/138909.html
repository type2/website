&gt; I had thought I had gotten the Genuine Door Seals from OE but when I put one
&gt; on today the fit is terrible so perhaps I didnt get the Genuine ones.

I bought European OE seals from OEVeedub in June 2003. All of the window
seals were top notch. The body seals were excellent except for two:

- engine lid seal. See http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/EngineLidSeal.html
- front door seals

The front door seals weren't identical to the original (missing top corner
at rear) but they fit properly on the driver's side and while the passenger
door was harder to close they kept out water, air and light so I didn't
worry about it.

I went with this seal to save a few bucks...

&gt; I notice Bus Depots say 'Genuine German OEM VW Seal '.

...when this seal dropped in price to $59 I purchase a pair.

&gt; Am I to assume that the seal is correct on all of the corners?
&gt; And that the corners that have a 90 degree point (which is basically almost
&gt; all of the corners that come to 90 degress) on Ron's seal have the corrrect
&gt; corners?

It is identical to the original:
