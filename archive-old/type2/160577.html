Subject: Re: [T2] dwell

  At ordinary engine operating speeds, the points open
and close a couple of hundred times per second, the
exact number depending on the number of cylinders and
the engine RPM. The points need to be closed for a
appreciable time in order to build up the maximum
magnetic flux in the ignition coil core.

  The period of points closure is specified by the
ignition system designer and is typically expressed as
degrees of distributor rotation. In a four cylinder
engine, the angle between each ignition cam lobe is
900 and the period of points closure or &quot;DWELL&quot; is
usually a bit over 450 of distributor rotation.       

  The dwell is adjusted by setting the points gap to a
specified distance at maximum opening. A narrower gap
gives more dwell and a wider gap gives less. Taking it
to extremes, excessive dwell means that the points
close too soon after opening, cutting off the magnetic
field collapse before it delivers all its energy. Too
little dwell gives the magnetic flux insufficient time
to build up to the maximum.

  Both conditions give a weak spark which gets even
weaker as the engine RPM rises and produces misfiring
at normal operating speeds. The dwell, as well as
spark plug gap, do have an effect on ignition timing.
The later the points open, the later the spark comes
and retards the timing. The earlier the points open
the sooner the spark comes and advances the timing.
That is why timing is the last thing to be set in a
tune-up.  Ta Da, Phil
