Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

&gt; I've been noticing a ~CLUNK~ type noise coming from the right-rear of my
&gt; 1979 Westy when I go over bumps, and checked it out yesterday.  I pulled off
&gt; the wheel and unbolted the brake drum, and was able to move the stub axle
&gt; in-and-out about 1/8&quot; by hand.  That would explain the ~CLUNK~ noise!

I've got the same in-out problem but will less play and no clunk yet.
Hopefully it will be the last major neglected item I have to deal with for a
while.

Why didn't anyone grease those things when the service called for it! Oh
wait, that was me. My bad.

&gt; 1971-1992 are all the same.  The only difference between the V'gon and the
&gt; bay is that the bearing housing on the V'gon comes off, so you can do it
&gt; on the bench (a HUGE advantage!!!)

So Steve, How hard is this?

Looking at the Bentley exploded diagram it seems that one could do this with
the housing still on the vehicle.  You seem to imply it's the best way:

- remove axle nut
- disconnect cv joint
- drive out stub axle
- drive in new bearings
- reassemble and swear all the way to 253 ft. lbs.

Accurate?
