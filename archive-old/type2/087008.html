&gt; I want to put a rack on top of my '78 Westy to haul a canoe, or lumber occasionally. Any ideas?

I have a 78 and haul my canoe lashed tight down against the top, just put
pipe insulation foam on the Gunwales.  now on a previous Westy (65) I had
a stand off I made myself to raise the canoe above the pop top.  
  78 is not a Westy and the canoe is a 17ft Grumman
