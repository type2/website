&gt; When my SO changed a front flat by herself in our 60's bug, she also
&gt; likely didn't tighten (center) the lugs in their recesses; she called me
&gt; about a terrible vibration in the front end...I said check the nuts, and
&gt; yes they were loose!  I've since learned to use a longer wrench (a
&gt; sliding handle) and to tighten in the sequence that follows one drawing
&gt; a star, or going clockwise, to the 2nd lug,  This is done in 2 stages,
&gt; one just to get the nut seated in its recess, and finally to really sock

I actually do it in three stages, one to snug up the nut, one to get it
tight then I lower the wheel onto the ground some and really get it socked
down tight.
