Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Spark Plug

Hi HapyBus,

 I have the Mexican 1600dp too, and yes the heads need
the longer plugs. You can't ask for the &quot;right&quot; plugs
for your model/year. I found that the Bosch 7504 W8CC
plugs make my bus happy.

Cheers,

Peter

&gt;  I ordered new plugs
&gt;  from my favorite T2 supplier, and they are the
&gt; standard (I suppose) shorter
&gt;  ones.
&gt; 
&gt;  Should I be concerned?
&gt; 
&gt;  1600 DP
