&gt; &gt; The thread on a  3.5mm bolt hole in my steering wheel is stripped. In an
&gt; &gt; attempt to fix this, I pushed JB Weld into the hole, waited 24 hours, and
&gt; &gt; then gently ran a tap into it.  No luck. The first time I inserted the
&gt; &gt; bolt, the thread gave way.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can anyone suggest another filler or another way to tackle this problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Use a bigger bolt.
