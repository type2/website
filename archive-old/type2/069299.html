 From the symptoms described and the suddeness of onset, I would say you
had acheived a direct short to the battery cable connection at the starter.
Just guessing, the brake line created the connection necessary and then
provided the fuel for the fire? Was the disconnected brake line anywhere
near the starter?  How do you charge an 8v battery? With a 6v system (not
enough EMF to get over the hump), or a 12v system ( size 12 charge in a
size 8 battery)? 
Good luck

Craig
