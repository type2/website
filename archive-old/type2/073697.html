Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??


&gt;  I don't see '70 models bringing in a lot of
&gt;money,

HA! That doesn't mean folks won't try.. Here in Austin there is a gorgeous
(outside) 70 Deluxe for sale, beige, no visible rust, stock rims, etc.
Don't know what the inside looks like, as the windows are heavily tinted.
Asking price?  $5,000!!!!
If anyone really wants a good laugh, I'll get the phone number off the car
- pmail me for it. I'll even go look at it for you. But you'd be a fool to
pay that much for a non-camper Bay... shoot, ANY bay. And I love MY 70
Deluxe. But then, I paid $300 for it  :)


Howevevr, I WILL keep the info for my insurance folks, should I ever need
to argue w/ them about replacement costs.
