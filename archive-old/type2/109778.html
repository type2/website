Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [BP] oil pressure warning light

&gt; You are sooooo preaching to the choir.  Some german engineer is
&gt; laughing about all of the soda that has been dumped in the cabs of buses too
&gt; I'll bet.  Oh well, necessity is the mother of invention and all that.

I think it's a particular issue with someone at VW/Audi/Porsche - the 911
didn't get a cupholder until 2003.
