Subject: Tires for Canadians

Hi List: 

After all the crap I went to the Conti's CR21.  In the
end they were the cheapest/best choice at 110 $CDN
IMHO.  And by golly the easiest to get too.

For all you US owners Kuhmo makes a nice 185R14C but it
is not available in Canada (Probably costs about $35-65
USD, tirerack at $55). At first they quoted these to me
at 75 $CDN but then said they couldn't get em.  If you
need tires look em up, Id be interested to hear how it
went for you. Kuhmos are korean and supposed to be very
tough!

The Agilis doesnt seem to be available in Canada
either, but the closest MX listed at $169 cdn per tire.

If any of this information disagrees with what you
know, please remember that I'm in southern
Saskatchewan.  Its a little different from Southern
California!

Anyway thanks for all the help.

Cheers
Logan
