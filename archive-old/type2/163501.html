&gt; George Lyle,  moderator of the Type2_dot_com mailing list, said that while the
&gt; members  privacy and protection against government intrusion are paramount,
&gt; he  would inform the FBI of any suspicious activity.  But he added, I 
dont
&gt; think Type2_dot_com is near the threat of say TheSamba_dot_com as we  dont tolerate
&gt; discussion of anything but technical issues.  I  dont think many Islamic
&gt; terrorists really know much about the  technical side of VW busses. 
&gt;
So, in order to differentiate between Islamo-Nazies, transporting explosives
in their
(probably stolen) Bus and peacenik-hippies, transporting marijauna (for
medical use
only), one has only to ask the suspicious characters to point to the front
seal (Front
Is Front) of their engines...?-)

peroxide... ;-)
