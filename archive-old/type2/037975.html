Subject: Re: Holy dashboard (etc...)

Howard,

The hole punch you are looking for is called a &quot;Chassis Punch&quot; and is used
to punch holes in electrical boxes, so electricians use them mostly.

They are a pretty neat tool, but unless you are going do a bunch of holes
(I have some that we use to punch holes in race car and dune buggy dashes
for the gauges) they are not very cost effective.  You would be money ahead
to buy a good multi hole saw.

You can buy them at any good electrical supply (usually a wholesale shop)
where the local contractors get supplies.  Each size of punch will cost you
$80 - $150 depending on size.


&gt;Thanks for the replies (I know the circular-saw things you mean, but I was
&gt;worried that they might not work
&gt;well on sheetmetal)  - being a 1970, most of the dash has no padding.
&gt;
&gt;BUT...
&gt;
&gt;A colleague has told me of a tool consisting of two halves which are fitted
&gt;to front and back of the metal via a pilot hole, and then a blade of some
&gt;kind which is turned by an allen key to cut the hole.  It's intended for
&gt;just such a job as this.
&gt;Anyone know what thy're called, or where to find one ???
&gt;

&gt;Also, I'm thinking of buying a Stainless Exhaust from Volksbits (in the UK)
&gt;any one know if they're any good ?
