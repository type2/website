Subject: Clutch cable tube cleanout

List,

Firstly, thanks to all for your replies re the rear window seal .. 

Anybody cleaned out their clutch cable tube lately?  The clevis pin on my cable
at the pedal arm assembly gave out at lunch today; luckily I was turning back
into the parking lot and was able to coast into place  :O)  I had bought a
replacement cable from Ron a while back and figured it was a good time to swap
them out.  Evidently there's so much gunk and sh*t built up at the forward end
of the tube, I ended up cutting the ends off the old cable and pulling it thru,
but the new cable won't go.  I considered compressed air, hot water/soap,
solvent, nitroglycerine, buying a new bus .. your thoughts?  Thanx.
