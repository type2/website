Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle Custody in Washington State. Any Clues? 

Christopher,

Call up the DMV or whatever they call it there and ask about a lost title.

Keep the story simple cause you *should* have had a bill of sale...even if 
it was for $1.00 from the last guy that had it.

In Arkansas, you can apply for a lost title(and I have twice) in the same 
kind of situation that you have now.

You send off all of the info you have to the DMV and they check to make 
sure that it isn't stolen, and about 15 other things and then send you a 
letter that says go get a bond for X amount of $$$$$.

Once you have the bond from an insurance company(about $75), then you 
march right down to the local license office with the paper from the DMV 
in Little Rock that says says give the man a set of plates and then we 
will send him a title.

If someone shows up from the letters that the DMV sent out and says
I want my bus, then I assume they get the bond money instead....or maybe 
they get the bus and you get the money...never had it happen yet.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey hey, I got this bus right. It was given to me by a guy named Elijah.
&gt; He never had it regestered, and he never had the title. He got it from a
&gt; Maria. Maria never had the title transferred or got it registered
&gt; either. She got it from Ricky. I called a licensing place and found out
&gt; that it's still in Ricky's name. (don't ask me how I got them to tell me
&gt; that) Here comes the fun part.
