Subject: Collector/muffler indentification

My muffler is getting louder and louder, and a close examination shows no
holes or leaks.  It's not either of the exhaust setups in the microfiche
files.

I need to replace it before my landlord sets his foot down about the noise.

Frankly, it looks a lot like one of those &quot;cherry bomb&quot; mufflers that kids
(back in my youth) use to put on their cars to make them louder.  There's a
&quot;4 into 1&quot; or &quot;2-2-1&quot; set of collectors, then the &quot;cherry bomb&quot;-looking
muffler which runs back across to the right where there's a 90 degree pipe
that turns to the rear.  The muffler itself is tapered at both ends but
expands to 2.5&quot; or 3&quot; along its length.

I just spent over an hour searching the 'Net for something similar, but the
only thing even close is item #3714 on this page:
http://www.empius_dot_com/e/exhaustsystems.html

But it's not exact.  Mine has the collectors coming together more to the
right, with the 90 degree pipe coming out of the muffler about 6&quot; in from
the outside edge of the rear of the bus.

I'll look closer at it tomorrow.  It was too hot (note the burned finger) to
mess with today.

Thanks for any help.
