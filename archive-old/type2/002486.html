I read the list religously (that is daily, not just at Easter and
Christmas), and have responded occasionally. Charlies BPRS got me thinking,
that surely  if people dont know ya, they probably aren't/can't help ya when
ya need it.

They chances of me being stuck on the road with my bus is relativley slim
 I don't take it that far afield) , and the most aid I would need is &quot;Who is
the local VW guy to trust&quot;. But that is a pretty important question!!

So here I am list. Rick McGuirt, eye doctor by day ( yes put on the $2.00
safety glasses when working on your bus) , bus driver any other time.

I am currently starting the sound proofing of our 71, 7 pass. bus , that
once was a hard top camper.  We did the engine compartment with canned
rubber and foil bubble pack insulation, topped of the ceiling of the engine
area with flashing pop rivited and sheet metal screwed. (Do the screws, they
were easier to install ).

We did the canned 'Stuff' in as many holes as we could fine that didn't look
like they were doing something. A little one sided tacky foam insulation on
the sheet metal apron, cleaned my battery terminals, etc. and removed all
the interior panels . Which was fairly sound proofed on the floor already.
The walls hadn't been touched. I think the canned 'Stuff' in all the hollow
spots will be a major fix.

I am looking at different sound deadeners for the surfaces,  Q pads (or
similar products) are pricey, and  the apparant favorite, but I found they
are available in larger sheets for cutting. Some one reccomended spray on
bed liner ( like in the back of a truck). Now there's and idea. It would be
quick and good, and it makes the Qpads look affordable.

More later. How are others sound proofings going?
