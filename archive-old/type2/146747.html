Subject: Re Window Frame parts

	I've got a lot of rusting and nearly rusted-out metal bits around the
	side windows of the Wonderbus. Looks like orange-red oysters are growing
	under the rubber.

	Who's a good source for stuff like this? I checked bus boys and bus
	depot and didn't find a category.

The rubber on the driver's side vent window in my bus is also deteriorating. 
I'd like to get it all replaced before rust starts in on the door.  Can anyone 
recommend a good place to get window rubber?
