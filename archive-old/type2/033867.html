Subject: 71 brake problem

hey guys,
after driving my friends 71 around... we noticed a problem witht he rear
right brake.  It makes a clunking sound and jerks the brake pedal up and
down when braking.  It doesn't really do it if you go really easy on the
pedal though.  The motor will sometimes quit too after depressing the
brake pedal. a very nice rebuilt motor too.  The parking brakes don't
work any more either.  could an adjusting nut have come off and fallen
into the drum?  It sounds and feels nasty..

thanks
