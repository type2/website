&gt;In case you haven't noticed, the front of a Bus is shaped like a brick
wall.
&gt;In order to get a Bus to go 90MPH without straining the engine, you'll need
&gt;many hundreds of horsepower...so yeah, a Winston Cup race engine will
&gt;probably do it. Maybe.

I have a photo of the spedometer in my 78 westy _at_ 86mph with a stock 2.0
litre engine. Its possible. It wouldn't take much of a grade before this
dropped.

This is pretty hard on the engine, and its not the securest ride in
the world :)
