Subject: Re: [T2]vaccum brakes

I understand how you feel. I work on old Jettas and Golfs. You talk to 5  
local shops and the dealer and pull out the bentley and noone knows. Then you  
start going through wires and find that the person drove for 4 years with a  
broken motor mount and the pull of the motor rubbed a wire against a piece of  
metal that was never designed to do. 
 
Like in your case the Bentley assumes that the vehicle is taken care of and  
didn't think that in 30 years the seat cushions would rot and drop pieces of 
it  on the resevior cap or the cap would be put on the floor of the bus to  add 
fluid and collect dirt in it. Until someone experiences the problems that  
weren't designed to happen we will continue to learn by trail and error. The  
good thing is you have just about rebuild your brake system. So scratch brakes  
off your things to do list for awhile and wait for the next unusual  problem 
in another component to make you pull your hair out. 
Glad you found it and now you know why so many shops don't mess  with old 
cars be it VW or Chevy, BMW, you name it. OR they want to replace  everything not 
just the part you think it is. Making money off old cars isn't as  easy as it 
seems.
