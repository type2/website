&lt;&lt; Just before I moved I came across a local hardware store that stocked
Hillman Fasteners: an amazingly organized well stocked collection of metric
buts and bolts.  It was part of the DoItBest chain but I can't find a store
in the Bay Area.
 &gt;&gt;

All the more reason to support whatever is left of your local marchants...
Independant VW-based vendors, hardware stores, lumberyards, etc. Keep
in mind how you feel about the Big Store (VWoA) now...The mega-stores
can only carry what turns a big volume profit, under pricing the smaller
stores &quot;bread and butter&quot; lines as well as their small volume specialty
lines.
