I think that your on the right track, but on a different train of thought.
I believe that your carb has a leak allowing fuel to flow as you have said.
But instead of washing oil away, I think that one or more of your cylinders
filled with fuel, thus creating a hydraulic lock condition.  Eventually you
created enough pressure or your valves/rings leaked enough out to allow you
to turn the motor over.  Just my thoughts, your mileage may vary, etc.,
etc......

&gt;So, my theory is...  The shut off valve in the carburetor is sticking and
&gt;didn't close, allowing fuel to slowly pass through (hence the smell).  The
&gt;fuel made it's way to the cylinders and flushed the oil out, causing the
&gt;pistons to stick when I tried to start it??.  After it turned over, new oil
&gt;was present and all was well.  I have had my crankcase fill with gas
before.
