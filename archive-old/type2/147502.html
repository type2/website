&gt; Hey, Dan, if the front window is a one piece wrap around (I guess 
&gt; that's what Mario is doing), how did you get 13 panels.  Do you have a 
&gt; High Top with curtains up there??

i did two curtains / panels for each of the sliders, rear side windows and the rear hatch.   
i did one each for pass and drivers window and one for the front window.  that 
makes 13.
