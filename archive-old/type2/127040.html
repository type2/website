&gt; Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest 
&gt; impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered

&gt; covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.

2 ideas for you. 

1. you are trying to turn it the correct way, right?  righty-tighty
lefty-loosie.

2. I used a file as a &quot;lever&quot; to help turn it. I managed to find one
that was the same thickness as the slot and put it in w/ the slot and
pulled.
