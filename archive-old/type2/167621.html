&gt; I am in the market for a new welder. I learned to weld on some of the best

&gt; me. It is good at what it does, but flux core welding just plain out sucks.

&gt; Lincoln Weldpak 100HD ($369 + $69 for the gas kit).

&gt; does anyone have any experience with these models?
&gt;
&gt; The majority of my work is going to be on VW body panels and some *cough*

&gt; I have limited experience with the consumer market welders. I am looking for
&gt; clean consistent welds on sheet metal. I know you get what you pay for so
&gt; I'm assuming the 100HD is not the best unit for me.
&gt;

I have the weldpak 100 with a gas hookup (25%argon)
it is an adequate consumer level welder..  it's biggest problem is that it
has a low duty cycle, and it will shut down itself if you work it too
hard. but the quality and ability to produce is more than coompetent to do
everything I have asked it to do.  the quality of the weld is much more
the skill of the weldor  than anything else.
