Here are the sizes and styles of Westy cot bars:
55 1/4&quot;, round, black = split bus
56 1/4&quot;, round, black = 68
56 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, galvanized = 69 - 73
57 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, galvanized = 74 - 75
2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, galvanized = 76 - 79

68 to 73 stored on top of the side cabinet. 74 - 75 stored under the full
width bed/bench seat, 76-79 were collapsible because the bed was 3/4 width
and one piece bars won't fit anywhere. The round black ones bend very
easy....

&gt; &gt;   The later ones had the adjustable stamped/bent flat steel
&gt; &gt; galvanized &quot;poles&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I have a nice childs cot with these style poles...but they are not
adjustable
&gt; as far as I can see.  How were they supposed to adjust?  If anyone would
want
&gt; to trade this cot (and all mounting hardware) for a nice (no rips or
holes)
&gt; cot that would fit my 71, I'd like to do that.
&gt;
&gt; thanks
