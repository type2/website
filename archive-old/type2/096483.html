Subject: Re: [T2] (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) Zits comic strip

Guys(and ladies)

The funny part about the strip is that he has the dreaded
vw emblem displayed prominently on the front.

Wonder what the bad boys at VWAG think about that and how long before they
try and sic their lawyers on the cartoonist.  LOL

Happy friday!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hello All   have ant of you seen and been keeping up with the Zits comic 
&gt; strip. The kids are putting together a VW van that sometimes looks like a bay 
&gt; and others times it looks like a splittie. I was thinking that we should get 
&gt; these kids on the type 2 list to help them get this thing together better. 
&gt; Any ideas on how to email this comic strip.these kids need our help to say 
&gt; nothing about the poor guys writing the strip. :)  later and have fun   Mark
