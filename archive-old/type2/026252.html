&gt;When moving off from a standstill I am getting a &gt;grinding/whirring noise from the front left wheel when &gt;turn the steering wheel.
&gt;
&gt;Have you checked your speedo cable is seated properly?
&gt;
I had this happen to me once.  The speedo cable did not seal properly (old seal shot) and allowed water in to the wheel bearings.  Made the same kind of grinding noise.  Replaced both the speedo cable and wheel bearings.
