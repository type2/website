Subject: Re: [T2] Engine numbers?

&gt; I was checking the engine numbers on my '75
&gt; last night and EA is what I come up with. 1700 right? I could have sworn
&gt; that I found AE in the Bentley and Muir but not EA. Anyway, what do I set
&gt; the timing for? the AE? Thanks.

In the USA:
AE is a '71 upright 1600 engine. '75 is a 1800 type IV fuel injected ED engine.
Your '75, IN the USA, should have a 1800. What do you HAVE? Your email address is airforce military? Where are
you and where is the bus from??

If you are relying on the engine number that is stamped into the fan housing, DON'T! The housing gets swapped
around all the time. The true engine number is stamped into the case, but that just tells you what the case
was when it left the factory.
The distributor you have is the only real way to correctly time your engine.
What is the number stamped into the side of it? [you may have to remove it to read it]
What is the 3 digit number stamped into the arm of the vacuum advance?
Do you have vacuum at the retard side of your distributor?
Does your vacuum retard work?

Bus 1975-Early 1976 * 1800 (75), 2000 (76) Auto Trans
Distributor: VW 021-905-205AC, Bosch 0231 176 055 &gt; 022-905-205AC, 0231 181 014
Vacuum Can: 07 127
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 900-1000 rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 3-7deg Adv _at_ 6.3 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret _at_ 8.2 In. Hg; Centrifugal: 11-17deg _at_ 2000
rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3600 rpm

Comparing the 2 '75 distributors above, the part numbers are different only because the vacuum units are
different.  The centrifugal advance is the same. They both time at 5 after w/vacuum retard connected AND
working. AND working is the key to timing an engine to specs at idle.

The vacuum can 07 125 will have 995 on the arm.
The vacuum can 07 127 will have 999 on the arm.
