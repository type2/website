&gt; Hi!  I am just about done installing a rebuilt 2.0 liter in a 78  
&gt; bus.   However, there is a little 2&quot; wire with a spade end on it  
&gt; coming from the little box on the firewall on the passenger side  
&gt; above # 1 behind the breather.   A plug goes in the box from the  
&gt; wire loom running along the tin from #2  and the wire comes out  
&gt; from the plug.   What should that connect to?   Sorry if this  
&gt; doesn't make any sense?

Sounds like the blue wire from the voltage regulator:

If so, there is supposed to be a tee which connects it with the blue  
wire that goes through one of the wiring grommets and up to the  
alternator light on the dash.
