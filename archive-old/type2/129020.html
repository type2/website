Subject: Does any one make a thermostatic mount for an external oil
  cooler?

I mean to enable the OEM oil cooler to remain in place under tin but 
stacked on a fitting that allows for remote cooling as well, hopefully 
with a thermostat built in.

Best of both worlds is a really good thing to want.
