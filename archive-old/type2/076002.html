Subject: seeking advice

I know what i am asking has been asked many times before so i think
people should probably respond of list to keep repetition to a minimum.
I have a 78 westy and have had it for 5 years. I have decided that i
think i would prefer a standard bus (seems like they are the rarities at
shows now) Having only owned type 4 powered buses i am a bit spoiled, i
have only owned westies.
My debate is this;  would a type one powered bus be a better choice due
to cost and supply of type 1 engine parts or do the benefits of a nice
FI type 4 out weigh these costs.  I am also thinking in terms of labor
costs as i am personally much less threatened by doing repairs on a 1600
than type 4's partially.  Another thing that is quite clear to me is
that the supply of type 1 engine parts will long outlive that of type 4
parts and it is part of my dilemma.
What i am hoping for is to get a nice variety of opinions, polite ones
please :-),
to help sway me one way or another.
thanks in advance
Jamie
