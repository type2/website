Subject: Powder

A year ago I was working on my engine and looking ahead to detailing 
it. Dave Bolen recommended powder coating the fan shroud, and I tucked 
that recommendation in the back of my mind. Meanwhile, I found the 
following ad on the samba:

Atwell and I exchanged a few e-mails on the back channel about how 
authentically this represented an original engine. Colors are hard to 
print correctly, but the shroud looked gold anodized, whether it was or 
wasn't. I decided then that I would paint my shroud in aluminum paint, 
then clear coat it with a gold-tinted clear.

Fast forward to last week. I took my shroud halves over to the powder 
coater to get them media blasted. As I talked to the guy at the desk, I 
noticed a stock powder color that looked identical to the shroud in 
that picture. We talked about it, he gave all the usual cautions about 
pot metal, and I decided to give it a try.

It wasn't cheap -- $150 -- but I got it back today. The picture linked 
below doesn't really do the color justice. It's exactly the same color 
as the ad.

It will show up better when I install it and powdercoated tin on the 
engine in a couple of months. This was much easier than the tinted 
clear coat, and I got what I wanted.
