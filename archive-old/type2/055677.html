My '63 EZ Camper is indeed a walk through. If you ever see a panel with a
few air vent slats near the roof line directly above the engine compartment
air intake slats then it is a bench seat panel. Walk-through panels dont
have these vents near the roof line.

&quot;Dung in the brain&quot;, ehhhhhh.  Anymore, I am learning that anyone that
states anything as being a hard fast rule in regards to Vdubs has &quot;Dung in
the brain&quot;!   Good ole Dave Easterwood has gotta be the best &quot;Dunger&quot; to
our &quot;Dunging&quot; I have ever seen.

Just to prove it, my '65 Panel (215) has NO upper slats and is a Bench
seat.  Take a look for yourself at

....And we have the audacity to think for two seconds that we have
something rare and valuable if it is just a little different than the norm.
  Heck,  when it comes to T2's, nothing surprises me anymore.

Still waiting for the desciption of an EZ, ;-)
