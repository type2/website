&gt; Greetings all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at having a stereo system installed in my '74 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; There doesn't seem to be much to support the radio inside the dash.  I'm
&gt; almost positive that I'll be putting some 6x9's under the couch, but not
&gt; sure of where to put speakers in the front.  I'm not looking for super
&gt; volume or crazy bass, just pleasant quality sound that will overcome engine
&gt; and wind noise.

I installed a shelf under the dash (similar to the splitty shelf).  Two
small Radio Shack Minimus box speakers sit on the ends of the shelf.  Good
sound, but if you're a Golden Ear (tm) you may want something better.

You can get similar results with surface-mount auto speakers, but I had
the others sitting around.

I supported the stereo at the dash opening (mine came pre-hacked).  the
rear of the stereo is supported by a strap attached to one of the holes in
the dash for the original speaker.
