Here's how I check on a Type 4.

First open up the engine lid and look at your fan housing.  Immediately
in front of the fan housing, between the fan housing and the breather
box on top of the engine you will see a black metal rod parallel to the
fan housing.  This is the rod that joins the air control flaps
together.  The air control flaps are attached to the fan housing and sit
inside the fan housing on each side right near where the fan housing
meets the tin.

On the right side of this rod, you should see a spring wound around it. 
One end of this spring should be held under a projecting tab on the fan
housing.  

On the rod next to the spring you will see a tab sticking up.  This is
where the thermostat cable attaches if the thermostat is installed.  The
cable runs down through the tin and screws onto the top of the
thermostat which is bolted to a bracket bolted to the engine case.

When the thermostat is cold, it contracts, pulls on the cable, and pulls
the tab on the rod down, closing the flaps.  When the thermostat warms,
it expands, creating slack in the cable, and the spring forces the flaps
open.

OK, put your finger on the tab on the rod.  See if you can pull it back
toward the rear of the van.  If you can, bad news, you have been driving
around with your flaps not open.  If it's as far back as it will go and
you can't pull it back, then your flaps are fully open.  

Pushing the tab forward will close the flaps.  The flaps rod rotates in
small plastic bushings, and it should rotate freely -- when you push the
tab forward and let go, it should snap quickly and completely to the
full open position.  This is the fail-safe.

I've just written this huge message trying to describe something that
would take me 2 seconds to show you if we were looking at your engine
together.  Oh well, hope it makes sense :-)
