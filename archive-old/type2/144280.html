Subject: Re: Tune-up demo...

This is a cross-list www.wetwesties_dot_org and Type2_dot_com
announcement.  The camping is a WW event, and the
Maintenance Roundtable is sort of a T2 event.  It
hasn't been approved or sanctioned, but with all of
the T2's in the Pacific Northwest, such an event is
needed.  So like Nike says:  `Just Do It.`
    
(1)  Campout:  Champoeg, 9-17-2005 (Sat to Sun).
http://www.oregonstateparks_dot_org/park_113.php
Portland, Oregon &amp; vicinity.  All are welcome!   To be
held in RV Loop &amp; adjacent Meeting Hall.  Overnight
attendees must RSVP to Clifford Rhoton _at_
commodore97210_at_yahoo_dot_com, due to pricing and 20-RV
limitation.  $10 per bus for overnighters.  Attendees
for the daylight-only Maintenance Roundtable or for
the PotLuck will not be charged, but you must have at
least the $3 day-use fee permit.
    
-T2 Maintenance Roundtable (air-cooled from 1932-'83),
Saturday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM _at_ Champoeg
in the Meeting Hall.  We will arrange to have one or
two Air-Cooled VW Mechanics on-hand to answer
questions.  If your T2 is unique, then a Show-and-Tell
is encouraged!
   
-WetWesties Potluck dinner, all invited, scheduled for
6:00 PM.
   
-Please don't arrive to RV Loop before 2:00 PM,
although other areas of the park are available to you
if you arrive early.  Oregon State Park permit
required.  If you don't own one, then a per-night use
permit is available for purchase.
