I am going to resist the urge to utter an epithet or three here.

I love my bus... Okay.

One last time everyone - READ THIS:

 From http://www.type2_dot_com/type2charter.html:


&quot;If you think the
message you're sending is so important that the &quot;bus content&quot; rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it.


Jim, do you see how this CLEARLY applies to your post?  Not to mention all 
of the other posts on WD-40.

No more off-topic posts PLEASE.  PLEASE?!?!?  Okay.  I'm really serious 
this time.

-David
