Subject: 78 FI won't start.

Not sure what to make of this one.  Went to start it up on a cold day.
It fired right up and I let it run for about four or five minutes.
Backed out of my parking spot, put it in first, gave it some gas and it
died.  At first I thought I just stalled it, so I restarted it, let it
run for a minute, and then it died again before I even put it in gear.
And would not start after that.  The engine turns over but it won't
catch.  I think it might not be getting spark but I'm not sure.  Any
help is appreciated.

 

Cheers,


Duke
