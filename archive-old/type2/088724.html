Subject: Re: [T2] Brake servo rebuild kit?


It very difficult to impossible for you to rebuild your booster yourself,
even if you could find the parts, which it is unlikely that you would be
able to.

I recommend that you get it rebuilt.  I recommend H&amp;R auto parts rebuilders
in Dallas, Texas:

H &amp; R Auto Parts Rebuilders
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516


Mine cost $81 including shipping and they did it the day they got it and
sent it back the next day.

This is a great buy, believe me! I paid much more for a rebuilt here in town
just in the last year. Jan B
