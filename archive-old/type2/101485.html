Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestion for plugs?

Hello Pete,

Here is my thought. If adjusting the clutch cable
worked for awhile and then it started acting up again,
It may be the clutch cable. I bet if you try adjusting
it again that it will fix the problem again but this
tells me that you may need a new clutch cable. What do
I know. I own an automatic. And as far as &quot;pregaped&quot;
plugs go, I like the stock Bosch Platinum plugs. I
would still check the gap on them though. I bought a
new set and everyone of them were gaped incorrectly
for my bus. Gaping them is easy. Most auto parts
stores sell a spark plug gaper for around $1-$2.  ;)IF
you haven't bought your cap and plug wires yet, I
would recomend Bosch. To me, they work the best with
our Volkswagens. While you are doing your tune-up,
make sure you buy new points. If you go to
www.busdepot_dot_com they have complete tune up kits
available. That is the easiest (and cheepest) route. 

Good Luck and have a great day!

&gt; Hey there,
&gt; Any reccomendation for pre-gapped/regular plugs for
&gt; a '78 2.0 ltr?
&gt; Anything I should avoid?
&gt; 
&gt; I am hoping that new plugs/cap/rotor, air cleaner
&gt; will solve the problems I 
&gt; have been experiencing.
&gt; 
...One day I am heading home from band practice.
&gt; I am headed on Hwy. 26 
&gt; in Beaverton, coming down into the city. I am
&gt; traveling at roughly 50mph in 
&gt; 4th gear, when suddenly I slip out of gear, although
&gt; the shifter stays put 
&gt; and hadn't popped out. Then the bus stalls out! I
&gt; coast down the highway, 
&gt; into the tunnel into the city, and manage to restart
&gt; the bus, and get it 
&gt; home, carefully going through red lights for a mile
&gt; or two. 4th gear wasn't 
&gt; working; I used 1st`-3rd, and was forced to keep
&gt; revving the engine to avoid 
&gt; a stall....So I immediately am bummed and think the
clutch is
&gt; shot now.... I decide to take someone's advice and
&gt; slightly adjust the 
&gt; clutch cable a couple of twists. I get in and, it
&gt; drives! All 4 gears where 
&gt; working, and no chuggs. (Later), then, when I am
idling in the parking lot and
&gt; it stalls out again.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I am stumped, so ANY help would be
&gt; appreciated! Thanks all; happy new 
&gt; year.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Pete
