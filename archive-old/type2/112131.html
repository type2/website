&gt; Ok, so I am fairly new to Type 2 ownership.  I have a 1975 Westfalia

&gt; 500 or so miles I have driven it, twice now the #3 spark plug has
&gt; blown out of its socket while driving (actually its happened in the
&gt; exact same place both times, at the bottom of a hill while using 2nd
&gt; to slow the vehicle).  

Have you tried to replace the plug with a new one (new crush ring) and
see if the problem repeats itself. If you get the impression that it
isn't stripped I'd try this. And torque it to the correct rating.
