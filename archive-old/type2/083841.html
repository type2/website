Subject: Re: [T2] Gas and lights

Why would you think that a lead additive would be benificial?

I use a pint of Marvel Mystery oil in my gas, each fillup---

Great stuff to lubricate, the valves and guide's-----especially durring
the hot summer month's----

Good idea to run it in your oil too---keeps everything, clean and
spinning free inside the engine-----


Later,

Terry

Type2_at_type2_dot_com Subject: [T2] Gas and lights 
Hi all! 
Its been awhile since I've posted. I've been out of the country for a
while and just got back home and to my camper. Before I left I had the
engine on my 71 westy rebuilt and she was running great. I knew it was
running a bit hot, but I was at that mark to have the valves readjusted
and did that yesterday. I was just wondering if I should have been using
a lead additive in my gas this past hundred miles or so. The rebuild is
fresh, and I used no lead additive. I was once told if you rebuild, you
can get away with a low octane unleaded fuel, but I'd like the wisdom of
the list members. 
Also, before I left I noticed my headlights were running dim, so I
removed my housings and reground all the lights, replaced the fuses. Now
I have bigger problems. My headlights come on when I start the bus. My
turn signals work when they want to. My brake lights don't come on when
the pedal is pressed, but I have rear lights. No reverse lights at all,
under any circumstances. I looked in the archives, but found nothing
useful to me. How did I screw this up? 
Any and all help is greatly appreciated! 
Thanks!
