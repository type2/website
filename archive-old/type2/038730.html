Subject: High Top Registry Status

Hello again Volks,

A list member asked me what happened to the High Top Registry
I started here and I thought I should say something to the list.

I've had a change of direction and it looks like I will be
moving from San Francisco. I have four vehicles not counting
the two I already sold and I just can't keep all of them.

I found that although the VW is a great van I didn't enjoy
driving it much on the hi-way (I like lotsa speed) and hills
of SF so it wasn't hard to decide what to sell from that standpoint.
It otherwise is a really nice ride.

About 3 or 4 months ago my 'puter froze and afterwards
I couldn't open, copy or make files and I never back-up anything.
Well after several days of messing with it I finally decided
to reformat and lost everything, including the registry.
Such is life. I had about 8 documented with VINs and pictures of another

10 +/-. I have since seen as many as 25 around SF. I could have
reconstructed the info but it had a low priority and still hasn't been
done.
Also, I would have liked to do it around a web site and I still haven't
learned how to do one. The registry died quietly.

It was a good idea and fun to fantasize about. Anyone who wants to
resurrect it has my permission. Somebody from the type2_dot_com web site
kinda offered some web space but I didn't pursue it.
Maybe somebody can pick it up from there.

Keep on truckin' ..........

peace
gary in sf
