&gt;Sorry for all the questions, folks. But I'm getting bad info from my mechanic
&gt;I think. Here goes. I just had a rebuilt Bosch 55amp alternator and a new
&gt;solid state Hella regulator installed. But I'm worried that something is not
&gt;right. In the daytime, my voltage is right around 14. But when I turn on the
&gt;head-lights (low beam) it drops to just slightly over 13. If I run high
&gt;beams, the heater blower and the windshield wipers at the same time it drops
&gt;to 12, but the alt. light does not come on. What is the normal
&gt;charging/running voltage for a ' 78 2.0L FI eng. with the 55amp. atl.? My
&gt;mech says it should be over 14 volts regardless, but I seem to remember that
&gt;with the type2's that this was not the case. Again, thanks.

There will be a voltage drop when loads are applied.  Where are you
measuring the voltage?  If at the front of the bus, you will likely see
much lower readings.  Measure the voltage at the battery during your tests
and I bet it will be higher.  All in all, I doubt you have a problem.
