Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Tony, Tony, Tony----

This stuff was nothing more than Borax in tube form---
It gave the cylinder's a instant &quot;hone&quot; to try and stop the blow-by in a
worn out engine---

Worked for about 5 miles and ----POOF---the rebuild was a done
deal---more smoke on the water anyway--

This stuff was on the order of a manifold mounted wolf whistle----more
junk---:&gt;)

I have a Warshawsky's / Whitney catalog from the late 40's--early 50's--
I'll have to paruse some of the junk in there and  pass some high points
along one fine day---
There's some pretty worthless stuff in it,that folks actually purchased.

A 90 weight gear oil, and sawdust mix would always get a real toilet off
the used car lot--amost for a block's worth anyway--;&gt;)_

Unreal--


Later,

TK--

 
Later, &gt;&gt; 
Actually not 'completely' true, many millenia ago we got my friend's
(ready ?-), Rambler thru' inspection with that stuff...Stopped the
'visible smoke' long enough to pass...90 weight gear oil will cure rod
'knock' too... ;-)
