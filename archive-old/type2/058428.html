Tom -

earlier you wrote:
&gt;My 1600 doesn't have any of the hardened valve seats (and isn't there
&gt;some type of sodium valves that server the same purpose?) 

Sodium [exhaust] valves have hollow stems filled with powdered sodium. 
With the valve open,  the valve head is exposed to burning exhaust gasses
exiting the combustion chamber.  This intense heat is transferred
internally to the sodium, which melts and transfers the heat to the valve
stem, which transfers it to the guide and to the head.  Expensive, but
very good at getting rid of heat.

&lt;or any unleaded fuel protection.   What are the ways to protect an
engine against unleaded
&lt;fuel heating?

Additives won't do it.  For one thing, they don't contain tetra-ethyl
lead (which is increadibly poisonous and illegal).  Most fuel additives
are a mixture of solvents.  This might be okay for helping to prevent
ping, but it won''t do anything for valve seats.  It's the lead that
coats and cushions the seat, preventing the valve from damaging the seat
as it closes.  Engines from the '60's that ran leaded fuel had softer
seat material; they counted on this 'cushion'.  Engines that run unleaded
fuel use hardened exhaust seats; they don't need the 'cushion' of
tetra-ethyl lead.  Most vehicles sold in America after 1972 had hardened
seats.  A good machinist can install hardened seats during a valve
job/head recondition.  Hope this helps.
