Subject: gas lines

-- Just in case anyone was wondering, I think I may have a possible
solution to the extenuating problem i've been having. I'm wondering if
anyone else thinks this is possible.
 I can drive my 1980 Vanagon(with new engine) around the block about
 twice before it acts as if there isn't anymore gas and dies and I have
to push it back to the drive way.
I got so mad  I haven't touched it for two months or so.
upon talking to some one else he suggested maybe my leaking gas line be
hind the drivers seat was sucking air into the injectors after the cold
start gas was used up. I know, i know leaky gas lines are the death of
the busses so it's pretty inevitable the lines were gonna get replaced
before i drove it around the block again.( they only leak when there is
a full tank) so does anyone think this air sucking could be the culprit?
I've replaced the fuel filter, and the dist. only thing left would be
the injectors. Oh I aslo replaced the AFM.
thanx for listening.
BTW I get my new 1981 VW truck on Monday.
it's a happy family.
