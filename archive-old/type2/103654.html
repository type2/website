Subject: Free Surf / Kayak racks in So. Cal.

Hello fellow Bus pilots,
Thanks to Paul I now have a Westfakia poptop camper bus work in progress.
He donated his old poptop to my 71 Bus.
This means I had to remove my Surfboard / Kayak racks which are now available 
for the low low price of good Karma.
If you live in So. Ca. and need a set of 2ond hand racks p-mail me.
They will fit most any bay bus or minivan without a poptop, they clamp onto 
the rain gutter and are not fancy or vintage, just useful.
In the words of George Carlin regarding leftovers &quot;I'm only going to Throw 
them away&quot;

Cheers!
Tom 71' Westfakia &quot;Rasputen&quot;
