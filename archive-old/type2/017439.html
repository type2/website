Subject: Re-torquing rear axle nut, stuck nuts etc

I'm not sure this has ever been mentioned so I thought I would toss it
into the ring.  I have a wonderful tool made by SnapOn called a torque
multiplier.  I looks like a breaker bar with a large 4 inch diameter
head.  You snap you socket on one side and plug your breaker bar in the
other side.  This tool mulitplies you torque by 4 times.  You can remove
rear axle nuts with almost no effort.  When it comes time to reinstall
just put your torque wrench on and torque it down.  This tool is
probably very expensive but boy is it great.
