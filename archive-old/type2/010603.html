Subject: Drag link:  Nylock nuts?
Message-ID: &lt;19991113203822.9650.rocketmail_at_web2903.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I just finished installing a new TRW drag link (did wonders for
steering play!) and noticed a couple of design differences from the VW
part.

First, the length adjustment is held by a large jam nut, not by
clamping the threads.  This is probably an improvement, as the slot
that allows clamping also was an invitation to corrosion of the
threads.  The jam nut is a bit harder to tighten, as you must hold the
drag link in place against the applied torque to prevent misaligning
the rod ends.  I used a strap wrench, although a pipe wrench would
probably work if you didn't care about scratching the paint.

Second, the rod end threads aren't drilled for castellated nuts, so
there is no way of positively locking the nuts in place.  The drag link
is supplied with nylon locking nuts, so I suppose that this is locking
enough for this application.

The fact that this isn't positive bothers me a bit, so I decided to put
a question to the list:

Has anyone experienced a nylock nut in such an application getting
loose?  Let's not count nuts that have been reused, which is bad
practice for this type of fastener.
