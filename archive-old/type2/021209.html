Arch, list:
The belly pans used with the BA-6's are REMOVEABLE belly pans held on with a
bunch of bolts (14, maybe). Prime reason is to protect the heater and hoses
from damage, but possibly also protects the immediate environment (under the
bus) from the heater while in operation. It would also slightly stiffen the
structure, but I'd guess that was not the intent.
Darn near all bays 77 and later and air cooled  (and diesel) Vanagons had
such heaters here in the midwest US.  Diesels, of course were designated
DA-6, for _D_iesel instead of _B_enzin. (They had several differences.)

&gt; Why would it have a belly pan with a gas heater?  And
&gt; where would the belly pan be?
