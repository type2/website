Subject: Re: Too much advance   HELP!

David and Karl,

Thanks mucho for the help. I did as you said David, plugged off the retard and
ended up setting the idle timing at 4 BTDC which gave me 32-33 advance at 3000
RPM. No more pinging, smoother idle and plenty of power..

The dist I have in there has these two numbers: 0231170093 and 0229052055 and
the engine number begins with AW (making the case a 73?)

It was recently rebuilt at a reputable shop (12000 mi. ago). The funny thing is
it was running great with the timing when I got it from the shop, but then
after about 10,000 mi I noticed it begining to ping going up hills, so  i
started using premium and it stopped it for a while, then it started again and
got worse quickly.

When I reset the timing I noticed the timing mark jumping all over the place
and the shaft was wobbly in the dist, so I got a rebuilt, and replaced it by
the numbers on my old one. Will this set up work well? or would I be better off
getting a different dist? I don't really like 'close' if I can get it right.

&gt; As Karl said, you are using the wrong distributor for your application.
&gt; However, all is not lost - you can use the distributor you have if you
&gt; disconnect and plug the vacuum retard line and set your initial timing to
&gt; about 0TDC.  This will give you the total advance you need, and will work,
&gt; as in the engine will run and not self-destruct.  However the advance curve
&gt; may not perfectly match what the fuel injection expects, and you will be
&gt; running a few less degrees advance at idle.  I expect that those two things
&gt; would not make much difference but I thought I'd better mention them.
