Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; &gt; &gt; right, the speedo is on the front left wheel the power is to the rear two
&gt; &gt; &gt; wheels, they are not really related, a tach would be more useful as would
&gt; &gt; &gt; a vacuum guage...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Im kind of assuming that these tires are on all 4 wheels.
&gt; &gt; In which case they are related.
&gt;
&gt; right but since the gauges are not syncronized with the changes they are
&gt; behaviing differently  the speedo still thinks it has 185/14 tires while
&gt; the engine knows differently

Almost every bus Ive seen has a very optimistic speedo with the
correct tires.
Hes saying the big tires corrected his speedo just right.
