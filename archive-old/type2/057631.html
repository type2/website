Subject: Need a good 34 PICT-3

Hey all,
I'm looking for a good used Solex 34 PICT-3 carb.  By good I mean that 
the carb worked fine (and you have personal knowledge of this fact) when 
you last used it.  Everything should work properly (like acclerator 
pump, choke, idle adjustments, etc.) and when you last ran the carb 
there were no obvious carb-related problems like stumbling, hesitation, 
etc.

I'm having a somewhat serious hesitation/stumbling problem that I can't 
seem to get rid of, though I can shift it and change its severity by 
changing the accelerator pump adjustment.  I can find no vacuum leaks 
and the ignition system is in perfect working order.  The valves are 
adjusted and basically the car is in perfect tune except for this 
problem which makes it highly annoying to drive.  

I suspect a carburetor problem and before I go buy a new carb I'd like 
to get a good used one and see if that will help.  Or I suppose I could 
just tear mine apart but I've done that twice now with no improvement.  

So if anyone has a spare Solex 34 PICT-3 for the '74 1600cc engine (MUST 
have the vacuum fitting on the rear (FIF) of the carb for the EGR 
connection) then let me know about its condition and how much you want 
for it.

Thanks!
