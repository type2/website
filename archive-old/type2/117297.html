&gt; &gt; Is there any difference in a 69 and a 76 axl? I have the ones off of my 76
&gt; &gt; laying around and my 69 is in need of some new boots. Never done the job before
&gt; &gt; so which manual is recommended to follow. I've got Haynes, Bentley and Muir?

&gt; All bay bus axles interchange except between manual and auto tranmission
&gt; models

NOT!  Bus bay axles come in three lengths, 

manual tranny half shafts are all 476mm long
auto tranny half shafts are  left side  457mm long
                             right side 505mm long
