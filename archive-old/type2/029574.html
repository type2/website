Mike is absolutely right on this.  There is an additional parameter, tho.  
The three factors affecting the final amount of fuel delivered are:

Fuel pressure,
Injector timing, *and* 
Orifice size.

If you have a clogged injector or if your injectors have many miles, then
the diameter of the orifice is almost certainly not &quot;stock&quot; and the mix
will change based on that.
