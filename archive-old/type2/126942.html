Subject: Re: [T2] Problems with 68 Westy

&gt;   Downside, I have a bit of a 'bind' that I can't locate.
&gt;   On the pass. side wheel, (which now has a new inner bearing, new
&gt; seals, cleaned &amp; re-greased, new cv's plus cleaned and regreased) the
&gt; wheel turns about 300 degrees, then is near impossible (by hand) for
&gt; 60. Then 300 fine, 60 hard, 300 fine, 60hard...etc. What could be
&gt; causing this. Incidentally, I noticed this before installing the CV's.
&gt; This is also the wheel which was giving me problems before I pulled the
&gt; CVs and bearings. Previously if I tightened the nut all the way, the
&gt; wheel would be completely locked up. So 300 degrees is better, but I
&gt; want perfect before leaving on a 1500 mile trip Wednesday. It almost
&gt; feels like someone is gently hitting the brakes (the shoes are adjusted
&gt; to be fully away from the drum, I haven't turned them in yet.)

my first thought it binding brake shoe. probably the drum is warped a
little. try backing off the brake adjust on that wheel just enough to stop
the binding.


&gt;   Also, starting my bus is easy. Tap the gas to set the choke, turn the
&gt; key, done. But, after the choke warms it's like the carb isn't ready.
&gt; For the next while the bus dies at every stop. After a while it goes
&gt; away, and idles just fine any suggestions?

i would suspect either
icing due to blocked or non functional riser tubes and/or no preheat
hoses.
or
choke is misadjusted or maybe binding.


&gt;   And finally, what causes an oil light to flicker?
&gt;   I have a good oil level.
&gt;   Doesn't smell of gas.
&gt;   But the oil light is flickering. With this flicker there seems to be a
&gt; drop in power (could be coincedental). Thoughts?

hmm. this could range from not much to real bad.
-low idle combined with a high miles engine = hot flicker.
-oil sender too sensitive. check the pressure with a gauge to verify.
-really worn engine with low oil pressure. that wouldnt be so good.
-something funky with the oil relief valves or seats. wrong springs, in
wrong, seats dirty or damaged.
-try heavier oil. ie 20w50 or straight 40 or 50.
-overheating. this would explain the odd feel. are all of the tins in
place? engine compartment sort of sealed? belt not super loose? are you
driving too fast for the conditions?

thats a start.
cheers
