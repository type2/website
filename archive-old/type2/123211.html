Subject: Re: [T2] Was: Slick 50 - now Marvel Mystery oil

Phil,

Reference pointers on the net?  Publications authorized by the Navy?

Advertisements from sellers touting that *their* additive is
used by the mighty U.S. Navy because it was proved that they worked?

I would think that the additive makers would have been milking that one 
for all that it was worth, but have never heard of it....

Found these...re marvel
http://www.chiefaircraft_dot_com/cgi-bin/frame-aircraft.cgi?URL=/Aircraft/OilSystem/OilAndAdditives.html

and this one repeats that they are all fluff and lies
http://216.239.41.104/search?q=cache:FXRxUoR5XEYJ:www.twincessna_dot_org/oilad.pdf+aircraft+oil+additives&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8

No flames, just interest!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Marvel Mystery oil, have heard good things about it
&gt; but a long long  long time ago(1960), in a different
&gt; world, we (Navy) ran test on the R-3350 aircraft
&gt; engines using additives, we had some that did increase
&gt; the life of the engines,Drastically. this is where the
&gt; slick-50 and others of such claims come from and some
&gt; of them actually work. I have my flame suit on so let
&gt; me have it... Phil
