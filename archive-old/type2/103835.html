Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead net

&gt; &gt; I was looking through an old beetle accessory catalog (online) and saw a
&gt; &gt; great idea: an overhead net for the cab to hold maps etc. Has anyone 
&gt;seen
&gt; &gt; one for sale? I just might try to make one.
&gt;
Which reminds me, the 68 and 69 overhead net in the BACK of the bus (FIF) 
was so cool. The idead of putting the headbanger in was just stupid. I have 
a 70 westy so I get the headbanger. The net was sooooo coool. I could just 
toss my clothes up there, knowing when I wake up I wouldnt bang my head on 
anything. Bring back the net!

My friend uses a fishnet kind of thing that hangs above the side windows. He 
just tosses this and that up there. Makes so much sense.

If it was easy, they would call it snowboarding.

Jason Out.
