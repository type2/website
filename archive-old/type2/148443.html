Subject: Re: [T2] It didnt start!

The starter solenoid is just being it's normal 30 year old self. You might want to experiment with the starter relay/hot start relay idea. Requires a relay, some wire, and some connectors. I've used a Ford starter relay because Muir said to and I already owned one at the time, but I will admit now that it is prob overkill. A regular relay ala radio Shack 30 AMP Bosch copy would prob work just a well for $6 or so. FWIW I never had a hot start problem after that. Have had many episodes with VWs that act that way. My Beetle that i had in Italy ('72 Super with a 1200cc engine) did this often and sometimes in cool weather after a run on the Autostrada. Relay fixed it.

P.S. noticed a local inop '78 Westy was vandalized by someone. Broken out all the glass. Bus is good and 95% complete. Is a Westy. Has a/c. Wish somebody would rescue it. I can't. Contact me for further details. Bus is not mine but I could put you in contact with the owners.
