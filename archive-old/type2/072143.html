Subject: rust below windshield revisited
Message-Id: &lt;l03130302b3a95ca9667b_at_[206.163.180.67]&gt;

the archives touches upon this subject,  but not very thoroughly.

my  '75 has the rust. a bodyman recommended to me wants to cut the length
below the window; a good call since it is rotten with 4-5 holes and
one-third the metal below the gasket is brown and flakey. his plan is to
refabricate the window's lower lip using sheet metal bending tools. would
this be recommendable in the face of an aftermarket component that could be
welded in? the bodyman's price is inexpensive, but i wonder is it worth it
- hearing much about improper fitting window gaskets?

i'd be very interested in hearing if an aftermarket panel is available, and
who carries them. the donor buses here are rusted or have been rolled
rendering them useless.      thanks! steve

p.s...who's got'dem westy cabinet handle pulls (without the botton/guts)? :)
