&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there done a summer road trip from Southern California to the
&gt; Idaho and Wyoming areas? I'm thinking of a trip next month going up I-15 but
&gt; it sure looks hot, like over 100 degrees F., until well into the mountains
&gt; of Wyoming and Idaho. Is this as hot as it looks or are there some cooler
&gt; areas along the way that I'm not seeing? At those temps it doesn't look like
&gt; much fun for me or my poor engine.

I've done it several times.  I usually go up CA14/US395 at least to Bishop
(and thence on US-6 into Nevada) and most often all the way to Carson
City.  This first day is definitely _hot_, so you'll want to take it easy
on the passes.  Don't run WOT up the hills, shift down another gear if you
have to.

Once you're in Carson City, you're at 4500 foot elevation and it's a lot
cooler in northern Nevada.  Once there, you have a choice of
several routes to get to Idaho.  You can head east on US 50 (slower and
scenic) or I-80 (faster and boring) and head north on several different
roads.

Have a good trip!

George Lyle
