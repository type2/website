Subject: Beating it to DEATH...Happy Dance in Progress

Okay I hate to beat this one to death or kick a dead horse or what have you, 
but....


&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; You have to have the fuse. It is the key-on power to the 
&gt;double relay. It is talked about
&gt;here:    in the 1st
&gt;section. Except it does not go to 88y!

Confusing because the fuse receives the power from the coil by way of that 
wire. But the fuse leads to the reverse lights not the relay, so to 
speak(type). If you took out that fuse the lights would not work but the 
relay would.

&gt;It is a black wire that goes to the + side of the coil and feeds 86c of the 
&gt;relay.

Yep I got that. If the fuse is out, the power would still make it to the 
relay, because the fuse holder is a branch off of this direct feed between 
the + side of the coil and 86c.

&gt;Got a 68-79 Bentley? Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram. Look for 65 66 67 
&gt;along the bottom on the right side.

Verifying by it.

&gt;You will see the coil pictured. Go straight up to N. See the little 15? See 
&gt;the black
&gt;wire going to the right? See it go to S21? THAT is the in-line fuse for the 
&gt;backup lights. From there
&gt;the black wire goes up and to the right and ends at the double relay.

This is the part I now realize &quot;in-line &quot; is referring to the power wire to 
the reverse lights, however the fuse is not &quot;in-line&quot; to the relay. It is 
&quot;branched&quot;, there is no &quot;in-line&quot; fuse between the relay and the coil. 
Therefore it is not needed by the relay just the reverse lights. If you look 
at the diagram and go to S21. Erase the fuse. Is it needed now?


&gt;If all that wiring is missing, then you need to reinstall it. Find 86c on 
&gt;the double relay and see what is in
&gt;the wire plastic block. It is probably cut off. Here is the plug 
&gt;arrangement:
&gt;http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/FeulInjection/L-Jetronic/LJET-18.GIF
&gt;Section b has 86c in it.

I don't think I need to change what I have, except for the bad double relay. 
If the wire, from the coil to the fuse, was on the opposite side of the 
holder from the wire to the relay that would make a difference. The wire 
from the coil to the relay is not &quot;fused&quot;. The wire from the reverse light 
switch to it's power source is. I still have not found that though.

Thanks Karl you helped me figure it out again,
