Subject: T4 Case Lifespan

First off, I'm crossing this to vintagebus in the hope some of the more tech
minded types over there may have an idea bout these later things.  Sorry to
anyone offended.
Also to the esteemed Mr. Hoover if you have an opinion Bob.

We've been hinting around this subject on type2 and in a timely manner I
have some
specific questions about the ole aluminum T4 case.  I'm about to put
something
a bit warmer than stock together, but just a bit.  I have 3 cases available.
All are
from 2.0 liter '78 or '79 engines with 125-150k miles before they lost a
seat type
failures.  All are a bit gunky but probably routine maintainence however
were likely
pretty low on compression and run till they showed the normal signs of
death.

Now what I'm wondering is how much fretting is acceptable on the faces of
the web adjacent #2 main.  All 3 of these show this to varying degrees.  Now
I'm talking just minor stuff here even in the worst case, no major metal
movement, but...  If you know how the surface of the parting line faces
look, with the big circular infintesimal grooved pattern of whatever ground
or cut the surfaces, adjacent #2 on these cases looks different.  Dull,
grey, the hint of fretting around the case bolt holes.  On one only around
the lower hole just enought to wear off the hint of the parting line
grinding/cutting marks, on the second both top and bottom are worn dull
grey, and on the worst there is sign of little bits of metal pilling up on
the surfaces.  All three show the imprint of the bearing part# on the lower
half of #2 bore.  The bearing bore is also a bit dull compared to the
obviously (appear newly) machined surfaces on 1, 3, 4, but you still see
machine marks on all.  No ugly streaking or anything, but the perceptible
part #'s and a slightly duller finish to #2 bore.  All the bores measure
round and within acceptable limits with a Mitutoyo dial bore gage, and I see
no perceptible out of alignment with a machinist straight edge.  A for
instance, if you note on the T4 case the chamfer on the hole in the saddle
the case bolts pass through is larger on one side than on the other, on the
&quot;fretted&quot; saddle around the hole you see the imprint of the larger circle on
the side with the smaller chamfer where the case was not contacting.  If you
lay a straight edge on the &quot;high&quot; unfretted material, you could not get a
.001 feeler anywhere near under it, but running a pencil over the drop you
can feel the barest perceptible change in level, maybe a thickness of a
hair, I don't know.  With the halves torqued you see no light on the parting
line.

So what's the verdict, I don't see an align bore helping to do any more than
clean up the part # from the saddles and they are still round within
tolerance so I don't know bout even that.  Clearly the case halves on all 3
were moving around that bearing to varying degrees.  Do I use the best as
it, have it bored to the .020 T4 oversize (hard to get done around WV and
mailing a case is a lot of $), does that really help my problem. Shuffle
pins in a t4 not that I could have those done here either?  Higher torque (I
think ARP or Racewhere sells bolts and recs a higher clamping force.)  I
will be using a counterweighted crank and having everything computer spin
balanced when it goes together.

Real information sought, opinions if informed.

Thanks much.
