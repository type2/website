Regarding vacuum ... I thought I read somewhere that if the idle air

Sigh, I need more hours in the day :-)

&gt; It was no more than 3 gallons. I watched the gas come out: it was 
&gt; clean but
&gt; two months old. You drove home 40 miles without incident...plus the 
&gt; filter
&gt; would show any blockage before the pump got contaminated. I'd feel
&gt; uncomfortable draining a bus gas tank and pouring the contents into 
&gt; another
&gt; bus if I had not POR-15's the tank and made it better than new.

I agree.  I didn't think it was the gas, but I wanted to double-check 
after the librarian's comment.  I watched that gas come out and go in, 
and it looked clean to me.

I'm not sure I'm worried about the pump being contaminated so much as 
the pump trying to suck gas through a clogged filter / line.

&gt; It sounds like something is clogging the tank outlet.

I agree.  *grumble*  So, what's my best course of action, here?  Drain 
the tank, pull the fuel line, and try to unclog it with a piece of 
wire?
