&gt;Yep....its a Bosch v Hella thing....some folks who are really anal-retentive

Not 100% sure, but i think that both Bosch and Hella would need to have
their adjustment screws in more or less the same location on the headlight
ring so that the reflector can be adjusted along the correct plane(s) to 
put it like that. So i'm pretty sure that if there's major difference it 
would be a Bug versus Bus thing.

As for the lenses, I regularly buy Headlight lenses in batches of 20,25. 
It's not unusual to buy 20 lenses and NOT being able to make even one 
matched set out of them (!) Often lenses have the same partnumber and/or 
approval marks/stamps, but then there's another marking not quite the 
same, or one is newer then the other and was made so it has all the 
approval markings for the different countries it was exported to. I have 
about five/six Bosch Bug headlight lenses in stock at the moment, all 
different, one says Germany, another one Made in Germany, one Fabrique 
par Allemagne (French for Made in Germany) yet another one says nothing 
at all about where it's made, another one has an 'E1' approval mark 
which the others don't have, and so on. If you don't have the original 
lenses you're pretty much in the dark about which lenses are truly 
correct for your car. A friend of mine has two new Hella units on his 
356, these have even more approval (and newer) markings, so the new 
Hella lenses aren't a correct replacement. Apart from these minor 
differences you have RHD, LHD, US clear lenses, Bosch, Hella, 
symmetrical beam pattern lens, asymmetrical beam pattern lens, Bug, 
Bus, and Porsche 911 lenses. The 911 lenses are different in form as 
well, but they fit in a stock VW (Bug) headlight. I also have an almost 
matching pre +/- '55 Bosch Bug set with NL marking for Holland, one 
has it cast into the glass, the other one looks like it had it etched 
or sand blasted on.
