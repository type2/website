Subject: You, too, can rebuild an engine....it runs!! (pretty long)

Background summary: last winter, bought 72 hightop camper via phone...Fla to
Milwaukee. Engine was blown, dropped it whilst laying in the snow, rebuilt
it in spring in Fla. While being delivered, the rustfree body was layed on
its' side at 55 MPH :(

Rebuild: ring was cracked, and had already been updated to 1800, which was
my intention. Got used cyl/pistons/heads from Karl Von Salzen. And he was
always the best source of info imaginable, for a person who's only rebuilt
one engine in his life. And that was 1955. You read that right :)

For newbies, like me; when you line all 5 books up...yeah, even the dreaded
Chilton...there are many discrepancies you will note. Many! If you can get
an experienced wrench to talk you through the descrepancies..it's a
lifesaver...and you can proceed with much more confidence. Failing that,
next time I'll go with Fisher only..it always seemed closest to Karls'
invariably correct solution and so the others just added
confusion.

Upgraded to hyd lifters as well, did Hoovers' 5 coat method of tin
renewal...hey, I'm retired..I had the 40 hours or so on tin alone available
:)..., replaced ALL the seals grommets I could buy...not all are readily
available. And continuing to tell it like it is..didn't have excellent
results in getting the new parts from on-line companies.

Wrong gasket set..and very expensive..sent to me..it was for a Porsch. For a
CB engine, the Porsch/VW gasket set IS NOT the right one._dot_despite what the
seller says. To be honest, he was very quick to post me the correct part in
each case, of which there were a few...and still don't have the muffler to
box gaskets. (I do have an $80 credit however..for a returned item). Despite
getting the majority of major parts from Karl, at a dirt cheap price, the
rebuild (no split case) still cost almost $700 for parts.

Enough bad news. The good news:

Since it will apparently take me years to get the hightop straight enough to
get a windshield in it..and then the rest of the bodywork, decided to start
up the April rebuilt eng an hour ago, before heading to warmer climes for
the winter. Again Fisher is best for initial startup. A buddy and I made a
few errors here and there (for one, wire set used for electronic ignition in
a points application, didn't permit sufficient spark to fire even
once..replaced with cooper, and....)

She starts! she runs! She sounds pretty damn good if I (&amp; Karl :), say so
ourselves. May blow up next summer when I install it..but I'm a happy puppy
right now, as you can tell!

Moral: ANYBODY, with the lists help, can rebuild a suitcase engine.

Marv Krupp..with more running engines than rolling busses.

PS. thanks to Dave Easterwood for lending starter mount :)
