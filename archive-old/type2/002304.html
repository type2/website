Subject: Re: [T2] cutting off problem????

It sounds like you're describing the infamous weber progressive carb icing
problem;  BTDT.

Archives have lots of suggestions;  unfortunately, none of them easy or
simple...

Good luck.

&gt; Ok last weekend we replaced the push rod tube seals, adj points, valves,
&gt; carb and choke on the SnoopyBus (a 73 with an 1800, weber progressive and
&gt; Bosh 009) She's been starting up great in the cold and running so much
&gt; better.  At least until yesterday. I left work, went over a steep bridge
and
&gt; then she just wanted to cut off every time I took my foot off the gas.
Had
&gt; to either give it gas while I was stopped or just restart when the lights
&gt; changed.  Well I let her sit for a while and then when I got back in, no
&gt; problems?  I checked the fuel filter and all the connections...nothing
wrong
&gt; that I could see.  Any Ideas?  I leave for Indigibus
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/fullbusmooners/Indigibus.html Tuesday and well be
&gt; driving the bus around 2-3000 miles when my vacation is done..  Would like
&gt; to figure what might be wrong before I go...
