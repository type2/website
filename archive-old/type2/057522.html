  Yeah, I just got the oil temp gauge installed recently, haven't had an
engine that was in decent enough shape to really get familiar with it.
But I know oil temp is critical -- somewhere a long time ago I read
somewhere that anytime the oil temp goes over 200, the oil starts
breaking down. That's another reason why I have no comprehension of what
people are talking about when they say the flap missing would cause the
oil to be &quot;over-cooled&quot; --- that might be possible in frigid winter
temps, but any other time -- in a air-cooled engine, at least -- it
ain't possible. VW's are *always&quot; going to have an oil temp over that
200 degree break down point, unless maybe with a very large external oil
cooler. I used to run an external cooler on the type I engines, but I
had thought that the type 4's were better that way -- after looking at
it, tho, and seeing the actual temps, I think I'm going to have to
invest in a external one.
