&gt;Here is the real kicker though!  My new AVP came with heat oversensor

&gt; From what I read, if they go over 260 degrees, then they turn color and
&gt;the supplier says &quot;sure it failed....you overheated it&quot;.

Most volume rebuilders do the same and are happy to have many reasons to 
void the warranty. They fall off of their own accord many times so I just 
chip them off before install. If overheating was the real reason for 
failure, tear down and inspection of the damage will prove it, but only if 
the inspector is impartial and not at risk.
