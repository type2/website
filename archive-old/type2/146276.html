In my  
experience, automotive primers/paints do not adhere well (if at all) when  
applied over rattle can primer. 

I work beside a paint and body shop. They use rattle can primer alot. In  
those 8-10 years that has not been a factor in appearance or durability.  They do 
the primer then go to the paint. No sitting outside or long term waiting  
while in the primed state. This has been on cars that range from mid 60s to mid  
2000s.
