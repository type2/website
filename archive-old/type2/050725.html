Subject: [T2] Curtain questions.

Greetings.  Just picked up some curtains for my 74 Westy and had a couple
of questions.  How do the curtains mount over the rear hatch window? 
There is no rod like the other windows have, nor any evidence of one ever
having been there.

One set of curtains is a little longer than all of the others, are these
two for the slider or one of the other windows.

Thanks,
