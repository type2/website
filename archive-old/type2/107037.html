&lt;&lt; Hi,

I never have any problems getting GL4 from NAPA which I belive you 
folks have in Canada. Sometimes they do not have it in the store but 
can get it from the warehouse same day. Last couple of gallons that I 
bought were Stalube brand. If you have an old bottle just give them 
the part# of the bottle they can look it up even if they do not have 
a clue. &gt;&gt;

Sta Lube part # SL 24229 (32 oz. bottle)
Google up lubricants or Sta Lube for a couple of 800 #'s
for tech info or availability...
(From another list...Guy asked the counterman specifically
for GL4 hypoid lube and the counterman asked him if he had
an old Porsche.)
