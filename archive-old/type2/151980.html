&gt; NOT a good idea to spray into the air cleaner with a starting fluid- we
&gt; did this on a 75 and it backfired, ruining the flow flapper.  Starting
&gt; fluid should be introduced AFTER the AFM, as into one of the tubes
&gt; feeding the airbox.

&gt; See if you can get it to briefly fire with a generous squirt of WD-40 or
&gt; other flammable spray. My guess is that all is well except the fuel supply.

yes I did it once into the airbox it backfired and the air filter started
buring, quickly put it out but ruined a brand new air filter....

&gt; cranking. Never a problem for us but keep a fire extinguisher handy and
&gt; the bus not in the garage.

yes, and check your fire ext too, I needed one once and it was dead,
fortunately had another one that worked handy....

now if I could only find a decent, reasonably priced, compact (don't want
much) CO2 ext for the van...  you don't soon forget the mess the others
make when cleaning up after using, about the only thing worse is not
putting out the fire....
