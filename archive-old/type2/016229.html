My blue and white 72 one the exterior is a C soon to be an A.  The interior 
is a B on the way up.  It is all original inside and out, except for the 
brand new seat covers.  It looks OK, but a bit of rust and faded paint along 
with some wear on the inside.  It is also used as a daily driver, except in 
the rain as the window seals leak a bit.  I'm slowly working on the 
restoration.

Rob :-)
