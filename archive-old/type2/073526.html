Hi guys. I'm new on this list. I have a vanagon 1981 westy air 
cooled. Last week I had a valve seat problem (exhaust valve dropped) 
and I had to have the head changed. It cost me big bucks and now I 
have to do my summer trips on credit. Well this is my question. Is it 
something really common on the T4 engines (I think yes)? What I mean 
I think is is there any way to predict it? is it happening every XXX 
miles? What is the best solution for this problem?

Thank's for your help. learning every day!
