&gt; Reply-to:      name deleted to protect the innocent

&gt; For sale: 1980 VW Vanagon, Westfalia
&gt;       
&gt;Lots of miles (100K on odometer, driven for 8 out of 10 years
&gt;since the odometer broke in 1987)

Looks like typical gear breakage when using trip clock while moving.

&gt;Transmission work needed. Does not go except in reverse. To be
&gt;honest, I don't know what kind of work it needs. Worst case would
&gt;be a new tranny. I can't even afford to even have it looked at, so
&gt;this could be a bargain opportunity for you. I have lots of bills
&gt;to pay and can't give this car the attention it needs right now.

Seller tried to use reverse to avoid parking ticket, and now reverse 
doesn't work either.

&gt;Strong motor, recent head work (December, driven sparingly since
&gt;April) and well maintained w/oil changes and such.

Oil is black and runny, and in baaadddd shape.
Sounds like it's ready to explode, lifters make a LOT of noise, at 
least I hope it's only lifters.
Left side 110/120 right side 140/150 before/after oil added.
Enormous amount of oil leakage underneath, too much to determine
source.  Push rod tubes and valve covers are dry tho.
        
&gt;New battery, Plenty of wear left on tires. 
&gt;NICE Kenwood detatchable face stereo w/Pioneer speakers also
&gt;available. I'd like to hold on to this, but it is currently
&gt;installed in the car, so something could be negotiated. 

True on tires, stereo stayed with bus sale.  Battery, time will
tell, it's a Die Hard, we had to jump start, been sitting a few weeks
so I'll pass no judgement, yet, looked new.  Supposedly a $400 radio.

&gt;This car has its share of idiosyncracies, but this is a soul car
&gt;and sleeps four. Camper = good times. 

Let's see, where shall I begin.  The interior is completely shot.
All panels have plastic wallpaper in shreds or completely missing.
front seats are torn up, padding missing.  Cushions in rear are 
worn to the foam and some of that is been worn off.  The fridge 
had an alcohol fire, seller claims superficial damage, hmm.
Tables are missing, at parents house, will rescue at a later date.
Westi top is in great shape, two small places where seal has migrated
position and needs to be re-positioned.  Canvas is perfect, along with
upper bunk pads.  Looks never used.  Upper rear center cabinet has 
been removed (probably bonked head on it once too often, ah well)
Seller didn't know where brake/clutch resevoir was, so didn't know
that the wet stuff that soaking the drivers flooring was brake fluid.

And now the good stuff.
The body is in great shape.  One small bash in the left rear corner
panel.  A few small rust spots.  One small dent in rear hatch.
Seller had drivers door fall off due to retainer breaking off, and had
it professionally repaired/painted, decent job.

CV's are in good shape, better than mine, saves $200.
Tires are in good shape, lots better than mine, saves $150.
Gas tank is in primo shape, no signs of dents or leaks.
mine is caved in and vents system leaks, saves lots of $

And the real reason I bought it, the top end of the engine, meaning
the stuff I need to get an engine to pass smog is all there and looks
in good shape, thought the muffler leaks and may need replacing.

Not bad overall, I may end up using this one as the keeper in
the long run, as the body is in better shape than mine.

Oh, yah, I got him down to $400.

Grass Valley, California

BTW,now that I have two '80 Westi's, they are very different from each 
other in terms of appearance, trim and colors, though both are from 
10/79 manufacture and both are Vanagon L's.  Anybody interested in 
those differences?
