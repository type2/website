&gt;   I've never had a relay go bad in my bus. Everytime something hasn't
&gt;   worked, it was always because a wire came loose or some other cause.

Lucky you.

Maybe I misread the original post, but I was under the impression that
Brian was able to switch the high beams *on*, but not off. If he's able to
switch them on, then the wiring must necessarily be in good shape.

Btw, tearing into the relay is FUN and a careful person will not damage
anything.  There. :)
