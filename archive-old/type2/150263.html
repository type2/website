Subject: RE: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

Hi Troy,

I would go with something a bit bigger than the 6000#. The curb weight
of a fully loaded camper is a bit hefty and when off roading the rule of
thumb is to have a winch that has capacity of double your vehicle weight
at a minimum. I think a 7 - 8 would be better in the long run for this
purpose. Warn has recently released a value-line of winches, the Tabor
9K should do the trick. Just my opinion.

======================
I'm just wondering if I can go with something smaller since I'm not
trying to lift a bus completely off the ground, but just pull it on the
trailer rather.
