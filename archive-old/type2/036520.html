Subject: Re: Horrible MPG

Thank you all!

My bus began getting horrible mileage on a recent camping trip.  I took the
suggestions offered here and went to work today.  Turns out the spark plug
cable going to the number one cylinder was cracked.  It would fire sometimes
and sometimes not.  Purchased new wires and solved that problem.  Bess the
Bus is running as well as ever now.

I really appreciate all of the help.

Thanks,
