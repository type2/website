You can get the blower and similar cooler from Pep Boys for much less. Look 
for transmission coolers. At one time (I haven't looked for a while) the 
had the whole oil cooler system that CB Performance sold for much, much less.

At 11:28 PM 1/13/02 -0600, you wrote:
&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I brought up why not rig up an auxiliary oil
&gt;cooler in the rear of the Bus, with a fan mounted behind it for some
&gt;extra heat---I read this posting, go to the site--and lo-and behold,
&gt;this outfit has the exact same thing, as a kit, to mount in the back of
&gt;the Bus----

&gt;I am truly amazed !!!:&gt;)
