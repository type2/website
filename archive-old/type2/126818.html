Subject: Brake resevoir to mastercylinder hose/tube '71

  I need a replacement hose/tube that runs from the brake fluid resevoir 
behind the drivers seat down to the master cylinder. I tried to find info in the 
archives but
could only find reference to the black seals/grommets that fit between the 
hose and the resevoir and master cylinder.  Does anyone know a source for this 
tube/hose
material?  I tried using some tubing from Pep Boys but can't get a good seal, 
the
fluid all leaks out in one day.  Any info or tips greatly 
appreciated......John
