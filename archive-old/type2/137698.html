Subject: Re: [T2] Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

What really bugs me about it is that one of the things we most we
cherish about our VW community is that we mostly enjoy a community of
outstanding people. I know there have been some recent reports of
thefts at shows, but until then, we have mostly enjoyed our community.

So if these kids admire our buses and our culture and community enough
to dream of owning a VW enough to want to have an emblem on their
bedroom walls, why do they want to hurt someone they admire or a
vehicle they admire by stealing?
