welcome to the world of &quot;Scrounge&quot; this part is a NLA from any source, as
are many of the vacuum and air lines in the Fuel Injected engine.

you now get to test your ability to cobble something up that will work.
actually that part is not too hard.

before I found a junkyard one I fixed mine by wrapping a layer or two of
metal heating duct tape around it and a few small wire ties to hold it all
together.
