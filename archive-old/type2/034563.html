Subject: Re: [VB] welding and a new website

I've looked worse in the face and made it whole.

Cargo floor: forget patch panels - get the brazilian whole cargo floor
halves.  I make cuts across the body - watch out for the tubes underneath!
and peel them up the I-beams like big sardine cans.  A dull air-chisel, or
normal chisel, or screwdriver and hammer, helps break the welds.  Grind off
the nubbies from the spotwelds, and you're ready to install the new ones.

Rockers: don't dink with have SS stuff fabbed - get the repro pieces

Bulkhead: fab pieces to patch, unless a donor is available

I only use an angle grinder to cut under *dire* circumstances.  I have and
air-powered body saw that takes hacksaw blades cut (snapped) into thirds.
Buy blades in packs of 10 or more.  I also have a couple different
air-powered cutoff wheels, and another die grinder with a wire brush.  You
can get cheep die grinders at harbor frieght for ~$20 - get two, so you
don't have to change cutting/wire heads.  You wown't believe how much time
that will save!

It's also nice to have a set of 3 shears/snips: left cut, right cut, and
nuetral - they come in packs this way, and there *is* a difference, and a
time and place for each.
