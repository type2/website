Listers,
    I find that the best grip on a steering wheel is to be had with the =
tape
used to grip tennis raquets.  Any size, color, texture available and =
very
easy to put on to boot..

Hope that helps,

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; perhaps this is a bit &quot;ghetto&quot;, however, has anyone
&gt; considered just wrapping the afflicted areas really
&gt; well with electrical tape. thats what i would probably
&gt; do. you probably wrap it tight enough that it  would
&gt; be barely noticable. might even look &quot;cool&quot;. just a
&gt; thought. later on-matty
