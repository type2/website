Subject: GEn + Bat Light with heater???
Message-ID: &lt;01BF0DE6.1C2E51A0.mdulany_at_netcarrier_dot_com&gt;

Bear Listers,

With winter coming, I will soon need to defrost the 
windshield and
that forces me to resolve the electrical problem that I 
have ignored
for many months:

When I pull the heat lever down in my '73 Westy, the fan in 
the
back comes on as desired. Unfortunately, so does the 
Generator
AND Brake light. This is a mystery to me as these seem like 
independent
lights.

I think that I must have either a partially grounded wire 
heading back
to to fan, a pinced wire somewhere behind the dash, or ...
both lights together have a special meaning that I don't 
know????

The final paranoid thought is the result of the observation 
that
when I blew the fuse to my radio and instuments (related to 
a different project),
the Gen + Brake lights came on! (Do these lights together 
indicate a broken curcuit
or some other symptom beside either light alone??)

The lights are normally off unless the rear fan is 
actuated. The fan belt is new and tight.
The alternator, voltage regulator, and battery are new. 
(another long story).

Everything appears to work fine, but those lights unnerve 
me.
Do you think it is something serious? or a partial ground? 
old wire?

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.
THanks all,

Mike Dulany
