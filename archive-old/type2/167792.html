&gt;  Did TUFOIL help?  It reduces friction (my mpg went up by 3 on first

&gt;178K miles- worth it I'd say, as I avoided a typical rebuild after 
&gt;my first 10 years of driving.

	The NZ distributors of a PTFE additive, brand 'Slick 50', 
c.1995 added their stuff to the sump of a Toymota Corolla, ran it 
some time, drained the sump, and then tried to drive the 420 mi from 
Wellington to Auckland with no sump oil.  The motor seized going up 
the Ngauranga Gorge on the way out of Wellington.  They tried it 
again and succeeded.  I vaguely recall that some objective observer 
was involved (AA or suchlike).  If this was not a deceptive trick but 
did happen as claimed, it would appear to be some evidence that PTFE 
decreases friction.
	Mind you, I don't know how far a Toymota Corolla will go in 
the corresponding expt without Slick 50  ...
