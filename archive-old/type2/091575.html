Subject: engine out, anything else to replace

OK, here is what I plan to replace so far after
pulling engine and tranny, anything else while the
engine is out?  anything that really isnt necessary?

pilot bearing
throw out bearing
shift bushings
cv joints (R&amp;R)
transmission shifter bushings and boot

was thinking about
fuel lines/hoover bit ( i have an '83 AC, is this
necessary?)
R&amp;R clutch slave cylinder
shfit linkage bushings

also I know I have a hole in my muffler, how the heck
do I get that off while the engine is sitting on a
jack?

by the way, thanks for all the help from list members,
they diagnosed the pilot bearing problem right on,
when I finally got to it last night all the little
metal rollers from the bearing were sitting inside the
bearing in a pile, that thing was absolutely
destroyed.  thanks again y'all
