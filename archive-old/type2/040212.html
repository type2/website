&gt; After I get my two girls down to bed I plan to try and get the '66s

&gt; anything?  Does anyone have any tips for this glorious event?  Thanks in
&gt; advance.

I think with the spark plugs out I would crank her over for a few minutes
with the starter just to lube up everything real good before you actually
fire her up.
