Subject: Re: [T2] Need to check it the cam is set corredctly

&gt; Can anyone think of a way I can test the motor still in the car to see if
&gt; the cam is off a tooth or 2?

Remove 3/4 valve cover.
Rotate engine in direction of rotation.
Watch #3 valves. 1st you will see the exhaust open then close. Then
immediately, you will see the intake open and close. If the intake opens and
closes then the exhaust opens, stop. You are going the wrong way.
Keep turning the engine and watch the exhaust. It will open and close. JUST
as it closes and JUST as the intake starts to move STOP.
Look at your timing mark. It should be on ZERO. This is TDC for #1 to fire.
With a stock or close to stock cam with no radical overlap, this will tell
you if your cam timing is correct. If your #3 valves are not 'rocking' at
zero on the crank, your cam timing is off. Rocking is the point when both
valves are closed between the 2 lobes.
