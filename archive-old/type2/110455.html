Subject: hyd. valves

I am getting ready to adjust my hyd. valves
I warmed up engine to operating temp before tearing down the rockers, tubes, 
seals, push rods, etc. thinking I was going to just put it back together the 
same day.
However, now it's been two weeks sitting since I found other things to do and 
had to wait on parts. 
Here I am wondering if I am going to have major problems with the lifters if 
they bled down and adjusting from that point, etc.?
also, am I'm going to turn 2 full turns after contact when adjusting or 1 
full turn...what is the correct turns (full or half turns) when adjusting hyd. 
valves on an engine with 60K miles on it?
Thanks,
LR
