Subject: Re: Removing door pannels

It depends on year of vehicle.  Some cranks use weird little wire clips that 
need to be pushed/pulled out while pushing against panel, others use 
phillips screw.  As for removing those push-in connectors that attach 
the main panel, I have a tool that works great.  It looks like a two 
pronged fork.  made to apply pressure to a large area around the 
connector, rather than at a single point as would a screwdriver.  
Screwdriver risks breaking the rather fragile board in the panel.  
Before you ask, I obtained this tool by having a mechanic leave it 
behind in my Subaru, and me not finding it for quite awhile, so I didn't 
know which shop left it behind.  I think it's made by Snap-On for this 
type of job.

The catalog type places (RMMW, WCM, etc) have most of the 
replacement parts.

&gt; Does anyone know any tricks for removing door panels. I have to fix the
&gt; window crank and I'm not sure how to get the door panel on and off. I
&gt; have pried some of the clips out but I don't see how to get the door
&gt; handle and the window crank handle off. Any help would be most
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Also where is a good place to get replacement parts should I screw
&gt; something up, like a new door panel, clips, whatever is broken in the
&gt; window mechanism, etc.?
