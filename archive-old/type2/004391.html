&gt;Actually, I know that the holes in the doors are aftermarket, but I like
the idea of going stock. So here is the question....Do the original German
radios use speakers that I could put in those holes??
&gt;
Hi,
no, they don't.
And only the old style radios (pre ca. 1984) will fit in the dashboard
without cutting the dash. Then german industrie changed DIN (deutsche
industrie norm) and bigger radio wholes became standard.
I have installed in my '77 westy:
-Blaupunkt Frankfurt with LMKUU (Longwave AM, midwave AM, shortwave AM,
double VHF FM)
-Grundig Compact Cassette Recorder (Recorder, not only player) under dash
-Becker 11 band short wave converter that mixes SW down to AM 500 kC to 1.6
MC under dash
-Blaupunkt 20 Watt amp beside passengers seat
-two speakers under the front seats, the original one under the dash
-Hirschmann telescopic arial, can be taken out up  to 2 meters length

I would'nt want to swap the sound of SW listening to a CD -Player.
Next step?
A Blaupunkt CB12 Radio including 12 Frequencies of AM 2way CB-Radio.

Best regards
Michael
