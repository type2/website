Subject: 22-24 mpg = lean?

&gt; well I'm not quite as flat and I still run the
&gt; stock FI system, but it
&gt; seems to get that kind of mileage you would
&gt; need to be running pretty
&gt; lean??
&gt; 
List agrees?

Engine is an AVP 1800 w/ good compression.  DVDA
dizzy and stock solexes.  I have no evidence that
they are leaking- at least with the spray wd40
around the bases as and throttle method.  

It doesn't run hot--at least using the &quot;grab the
dipstick method.&quot;  Maybe I should read my plugs
today?  

I haven't adjusted the carbs (other than
adjusting the idle with the big screw-whatever
that is named) any since I switched from the
hated 009.  Maybe the last guy had it leaned to
compensate for the 009's flat spot?
