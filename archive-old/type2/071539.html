&gt;  but I need the 
&gt;  firewall tin with the duct exit hole which goes over the tranny.
&gt;  
When I bought my '71 Westy it came with an engine out of a beetle.  So the 
&quot;firewall tin&quot; was of the short, beetle, variety.  I pop riveted an Aluminum 
extension onto the &quot;firewall tin&quot;.  Use Aluminum that's at least .040&quot; thick. 
 I've been using this for over fifteen years and it works great.
