Speaking of: I did the Hoover Bulkhead Thang not too long ago and came up
with a problem that is really sort of brain-dead, I know I should be able
to solve it easily but the answer eludes me:

The whole point of the excercise is to isolate the metal fuel line from the
bulkhead, or in this case from the inside of the hollow threaded lamp
stuff. So you fill the space with Permatex. Okay...but the fuel line pushes
the liquid Permatex out. There's some in there but if I'm going to all this
trouble I want ALL the space between the two tubes filled with goop.

Is there some way to pressurize it into there that is easily accomplished?
