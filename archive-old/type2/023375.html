Subject: Message from USAF in Italy

  This is a messge just recieved from my brother in law who is in the USAF
stationed in Italy. Bus content, he is looking for buses in Italy for me.

we are on full alert, only essential people are
allowed on base right now, everything is closed except
for work, maybe 1 more war before retirement,
hopefully this wont effect my retirement, during
bosnia they denied peoples retirement and discharges
if they were getting out.  everybody is pretty shocked
over here, but we are probably safer here than there.
just wanted to let you know whats up, will write when
i can
