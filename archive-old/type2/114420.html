Subject: Thinking of doing my own body work.

I've been pondering doing my own body work.

My bay has some rocker rot and some rot on the rear corners. Nothing is
structural. Who has the best body panels? Can this be done with some of
the modern epoxy adhesives instead of welding. I'm worried about doing
more damage with welding heat shrinkage. What fillers are the best? Any
good websites out there?

Steve
