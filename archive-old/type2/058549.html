Subject: Re: Question:  Case Adapter Question

Pat, Mark &amp; list

&gt;  Does anybody have experience with THAT?

In the days before the universal case, we drilled lots of these bug type housings
to adapt them for bus use....I don't recall the case letters to identify the one
with the casting bosses on, but the procedure is pretty simple...

&gt; Is there some kind of template or jig, or would it be obvious where to drill
&gt; once you have the rear hanger out of the way?

To be sure everything lines up later, we used the hanger as the jig to center
punch the bosses...one or two of then have positive dimples that should be
carefully ground off flat before center punching....We removed the muffler for
this if doing it in the car, and the rear valence....

Center punch the boss...
Drill the hole 1/2&quot; deep being careful to use a sharp bit, and don't let it
wander...
Tap, then bottom tap the hole, cleaning the taps regularly so they don't bind...

Be careful when selecting the taps to be sure you have the same pitch as the bolt
you plan to use....

Be sure the bolt doesn't go into the new hole more than 1/2&quot; when it's
tightened....don't laugh, I've seen good mechanics try to put 3/4&quot; of bolt into a
1/2&quot; deep hole....shim the head of the bolt to achieve the correct depth....

Remember my motto...&quot;measure twice, and cut once&quot;

Enjoy, all...trip report to follow from the great white north...
