... and I have replaced the front/rear wheel cylinders, master cylinder and 
still the brake pedal needs to be pulled up by hand. This is a 1972 panel van 
that has made it's way to the southern tip of South America and back to Canada, 
but today it was very close to getting a tow to the pile 'o' scrap!
Anyhow, went through the posts and came across one article about the brake 
booster needing replacement as well. Some other vans out there with this 
problem in the past?
Thanks for your time!
