Hi Volks,

&quot;Eric O'Dell&quot; &lt;eodell_at_pobox_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:

&gt; I also need a set of engine tins. My bus was retrofitted with one of
&gt; the older (1971-ish?) upright 1600cc engines in place of the original
&gt; pancake, and whoever did the work was apparently unable to find tins
&gt; to fit the new configuration. It's my understanding that some European
&gt; buses of the same time period came from the factory with this setup,

Most of them, actually.  I'm able to sell a few sets of those now.  
We parted out buses at the VW Bus Museum in Salzgitter, so the parts 
are available.  Price?  Well, to be honest, we'll take as much as we 
can :-), but probably shipping will be the most of it, as I'm in 
Germany.  Just reply with what you'd consider a reasonable price, 
which pieces you need, and where you're located, and we'll work 
something out.  I think we can get them new from VW as well - but 
that'd be quite expensive, the front one alone being something around 
US$80...

I don't know, maybe it'd make sense to ship several sets to one US 
address, and then distribute from there?  I think this might cut 
shipping cost.  I'll inquire about that if sufficient interest shows. 

&gt; If anyone knows, you will earn my eternal gratitude and
&gt; first dibs on my interior cabinetry when I strip it out to install
&gt; custom cabinets. ;-)

No thanks ;-)  - in fact, I'm just busy converting a custom camper 
back to the panel van it originally was.  (At least I cut the 
sheetmetal for closing the left window out of an uncut panel van 
already.  Now I know why some of you refer to such action as 
&quot;hacking&quot; :-)))

Happy weekend all!

Yours,
    Erik.
