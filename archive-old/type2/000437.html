Subject: Sodium Exhaust Valve Prices
Date: Thu, 11 Feb 1999 23:01:34 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've just been quoted what seems an exceptional price for what I am
garanteed to be sodium filled 33mm exhaust valves for the 1.7 or 2.0 liter
van.  The price is $19 each which is unbelievable and may be a misquote at
cost so I'm about to jump on it and order 2 sets but I have some questions.
I am assured the valves are by a Porsche OEM but do not know the make.  As I
recall a recent disparity over on the Vanagon list between prices for
genuine German sodium filled and other makes (TRW?), is this a good price.
Are there any particular makes to be concerned about or avoided.  If in fact
when I order them tomorrow I find this to be the correct information and
price, I'll post the source to the list for anyone interested.
