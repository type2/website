&gt; If hybrids are ever going to become mainstream (and there are some very good
&gt; reasons why they should) then they will have to compete head-to head with
&gt; conventional vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; I really wouldn't be too surprised to find that the New Bus might be
&gt; planned for the hybrid drivetrain.  The body shape of the bus is very
&gt; flexible.

Another handy thing about turning a Bus into a hybrid is all the room in the
back. If you install a raised cargo platform in a Eurovan, under it will fit
a *lot* of batteries. Put a big passel of truck batteries under there, fit
it with a gas (diesel or propane would work too)/electric hybrid motor,
charge batteries while the fuel motor is running, and you could go a very
long way before the batteries died. Sounds like a passable delivery van to
me.
