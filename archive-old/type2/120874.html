Subject: my fire stories..no extinguisher..  BBB burned bus

I don't carry a fire extinguisher.   I have at some point, but never used it and it'd just get buried under crap.    There may be one under the bed in the back of the bus, actually.  Or fallen down by the spare tire.  

Had 2 fires.    One in my 69 bug just after I got it.  put it out with a rag.  Think it was caused by really bad backfiring.   there was also a hole in the intake manifold.  

One in my 59 bus back in '89.  it was put out with water and a shirt.  

My feeling is don't wait and gawk and panic and wait till it's big.  Smother the fire.    Just my opinion.

Have had the carb inlet pop out of the carb once.  It didn't catch on fire, but it did lose power and die.   So I tapped it back in there and wired it in place. 

oops, no there have been 3 fires.   but the first I was was only 2 and the bus caught on fire in the grocery store parking lot.   I don't know why it happened, but the bus was only ~10 years old.  Later it got painted orangey yellow cause the blue paint was burnt.
