Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Hatch Seal Installation

&gt; I purchased one of the engine hatch seals from ISPWEST on Ebay.  This is for

&gt; originally installed with glue on all 4 sides, or do i cut the bottom part of
&gt; the seal from the top and sides so than the apron will be removeable?  Whats
&gt; the concensus here?

The hatch holds the seal in place, so there is no need to glue it on any
side, IMHO.  My original seal is glued on the upper edge only and cut in
the lower right corner so to remove the apron I just pull the seal out of
the apron, and swing the seal into the left side of the engine bay and
let it sit there.
