Jon, thanks for your erudite reply.

&gt;&gt;...I think Uncle Joel's message is genius for its
&gt;&gt; absurdity..

&gt;Actually, this reasoning does work just fine...I think we'd all be
&gt;surprised (and hopefully a little bit appalled) by the amount of
&gt;oil/pollution etc. involved in producing even a pack of gum.

But the point was that it is not calculable. Add to the resources consumed
in producing the gum the resouces consumed personally by the people
supported by the gum factory. Then, surmise the extent to which they might
have polluted if they hadn't had gum-making jobs, because that has to be
subtracted from pollution &quot;saved&quot; in the gumless quotient (it becomes
completely conjectural at this point if it wasn't before). Still with me?

Then, calculate the extent to which those people pollute when they are
doing what they might do *instead* of making gum. And the ancillary
environmental costs of that hypothetical employment. Then do the same thing
with all the people who work for companies that supply materials to the gum
factory, and those who supply them in turn. At this point it becomes utter
nonsense.

That is, we have no way of knowing the environmental costs of a new car, or
an old one either. Nobody could possibly calculate such a thing.

&gt;&gt; --Pollution is benign. Pollution *in concentration* is dangerous, possibly
&gt;&gt; deadly. It's the effect of it that concerns; no harm no foul.

&gt;There is more to pollution than just local concentration...CO2 becomes a
&gt;global problem when it changes the atmospheric mix, and eventually it
&gt;becomes a health matter when world ecology if affected.

&lt;grin&gt; Imagine the wholesale destruction that occured when the rapacious
photosynthetic plants took over the young earth, selfishly and without any
regard for how it would affect the mineral kingdom...

&gt;Crimes against the environment are crimes against local people and other
&gt;life, and eventually against global ecological health. Viewing it as a
&gt;specter is a view rapidly being abandoned by science (and reluctantly by the
&gt;rest of our society) that says that we can do anything we want with no
&gt;consequences if no one is aparently being directly harmed...

Some people think that integrity is also being rapidly abandoned by
science, but the truth is I have no way of knowing for sure. I do know that
harm is harm, and if it isn't demonstrable it isn't real. If I can
demonstrate that actual identifiable people are being harmed as of now by
capricious emissions laws, can you demonstrate that an identifiable person
*will* be harmed if those laws were repealed?

Do you want to be the one how has to tell old Rosa that she can't drive her
60s-era Buick to her job cleaning motel rooms, and she'll have to go on
welfare instead, because of a computer model based on incomplete data and
inference?

&gt;Please don't take my disagreement with you as a flame.

And me. I'm having fun. ;)
