Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

&gt; Truth be told, I've been operating without either the bolt or the plate
and
&gt; everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle around, make noise, or
&gt; pose any threat of escaping.  And with the plastic cover in place, who
will
&gt; ever know?

First time you hit something and the unsecured spare flies forward, crushing
your head or that of one of your family members/passengers, you'll know.

Maybe more likely in a rollover, but still...I'd want it secured.  It's not
like no one's ever rolled a Bus before (John Anderson, looking in your
direction). :-)
