I called this guy because I am looking to buy a 71 bus,  right now. Darn,
wouldn't you know, it's  not a 71,  it's a 61- 23 window *deluxe* micro bus.

&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; New to the list.  Just bought a 68 crew to restore (anybody have a back
seat
&gt; to sell?)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I spotted this ad in the SD Union that I was sure would be of
&gt; interest to the list:
&gt;
&gt; 71 Bus/Transporter, immaculate, show condition, must see to appreciate,
&gt; Appraised at $45K, $38,500 or best.  858-271-2077
&gt;
&gt; Good luck!
&gt;
&gt; Dave
