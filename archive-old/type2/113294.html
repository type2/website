Subject: Re: [T2] A funny thing happened on my way to the forum...

&gt; On the way back from the post office this evening the clutch cable snapped
&gt; somewhere in the middle of its run.

Was it because of the groud strap on the transmission?

&gt; Thanks to the sage counsel on this list, I didn't panic, even though I
&gt; didn't have a spare on board (yes, I know, foolish; but due to lack of
&gt; finances, not lack of foresight).

I just ordered a spare clutch and accelerator cable set. It's being shipped to
my parents' house in Florida. I sure hope I make it there!

&gt; 2. It is possible to push start a bus by yourself while it's in 3rd gear,
&gt; the key is on, and you're pushing from the open driver's door.  Not safe by
&gt; any means, but it did work.

Hadn't tried that, but I have 'bounced' the bus off a parking block, thrown it
in reverse and popped the clutch by myself. The bus moved about 18 inches
before it started. These engines are very easy to start.

&gt; 4. Never leave the Muir book home...

I left my Bentley at home last Xmas when Dad and I had to teardown the engine.
He grumbled alot about the 'book with the cartoon drawings'. Of course, if he
had been following Muir's recommendation for reseating the distributor drive
shaft spring, we wouldn't have had to teardown the engine.

&gt; 5. Be thankful that Darrell's shop (and that new clutch cable) is within
&gt; walking distance of my house.

Oh, how I wish! A VW shop in walking distance! I guess I could want to Mainly
Foreign, it's only about two miles away but I'd have to fend off the hookers
and drug dealers in between.

-Eric
