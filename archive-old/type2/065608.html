Subject: Accelerator pedal sticking

My accelerator pedal stick on a little from time to time.  It never stick
full throttle, but usually just above idle.  I can manually reach down and
pull it up to drop the idle down.  Is there a spring that returns it to 
the idle position on the foot pedal, fuel injection, or both?  Maybe it
just needs lubrication since it goes a little hard at first.
Any ideas,
Brett
