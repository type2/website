Subject: re: Upper Starter Bolt

What I usually do is this: after getting the engine lined up and pushed up against the bell housing, with the lower stud nuts on, I'm under the engine 
anyway, so I reach up and push the starter bolt to the rear (RIR) so the head's engaged.

Then I crawl out and take the nut, 17mm wrench, and a long, thin screwdriver and wedge myself into position for putting the upper nut on.  Take the 
screwdriver and set the blade between threads on the bolt -- perpendicular to bolt; the screwdriver is vertical -- which pins the bolt in place while I 
start the nut.  Works every time
