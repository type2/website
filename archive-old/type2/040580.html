Subject: Re: fuel venting

[...]

&gt; I am trying to establish standard fuel tank venting. the PO used a unique
&gt; venting device consisting of a 4mm screw into the tee junction above the
&gt; rear of the engine.
&gt; I have connected through to the charcoal cannister top right hand nipple
and
&gt; from the lower right hand nipple to the air filter housing but the left
hand
&gt; nipple on the canister? I thought it went to the fan housing but I cant
find
&gt; where.
&gt; Can anyone enlighten me?

Your sig mentioned &quot;1700 with fuel injection&quot;.
Which fan housing are you using? The 72-73 or a 76 to 79?
If you are using the 72-73, you don't have the nipple on the left end. The
cannister on those buses mounted above the battery and only used one large
hose.
Are you using the 76 up cannister and is it mounted to the gas tank panel to
the left of the decel valve? If yes, you will need to cap the left end.

I am a little confused on how you have the right end connected. There is a
small nipple and a large nipple, correct? The small nipple connects ONLY to
the tee where the left and right vent lines meet up by the heater blower.
The large hose goes to the EEC purge valve on the back of the air cleaner.
The small nipple on the purge valve goes to a tee in the ported vacuum line
from the front of the throttle housing to the distributor vacuum advance.
