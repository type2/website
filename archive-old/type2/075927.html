Subject: Natural selection = less fires

On 11/7/01 9:58 AM, apstockton_at_riconnect_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;As one who drove aircooled VW's in the 60's, 70's and 80's in
&gt;California, New Jersey and Connecticut, I can tell you that VW's were
&gt;always over represented in the engine fire category.  The reason you
&gt;seldom see engine fires these days is that there are so few aircooled
&gt;VW's on the road.  I remember the times when you did spot an engine
&gt;fire, the odds were about 90 percent that it was a VW.  
&gt;

I would stipulate that to a certain extent this is Darwinian in nature. 
The folks who neglected their vehicles lost them to fire; the remaining 
ones, as they become a rarer breed, are continuing to be purchased by 
enthusiasts with a higher level of knowledge and bigger 
investment-emotionally if not economically. People who will fix fuel 
lines, or deal with reputable mechanics and shops who will do so.

&gt;Check those fuel lines and carry two fire extinguishers in different
&gt;locations.

Always sound advice. My extinguisher has yet to be used on my bus, but it 
helped save a Chevy SUV some years back...  ;-)
