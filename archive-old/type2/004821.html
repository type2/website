After an afternnoon of pulling apart my '77's FI, i am at a loss. I have
start then stall condition ONLY when cold. Yes, the cold start valve is
spraying when cold. So I dove into the obvious. The auxiliary air regulater
is wide open when cold, I cleaned it up and stuck it back in. The 'series
resistor' connector is receiving power at the proper time,  so that means
the injectors are. I did the ohm test on the temp sensor, thats fine. the
only thing left i can see is the EGR....but I know I disconnected that years
ago. This problem only arose recently. Any suggestions? '77 2.0L FI stock
with 168,000 original miles. I can keep it alive, i know I can!!!
