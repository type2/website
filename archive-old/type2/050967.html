Subject: Re: [T2] broken stabilizer bar

Can anyone recomend a good brand and supplier for an aftermarket anti-sway 
bar?

&lt;&lt; his is the perfect time to put on an aftermarket anti-sway bar.  The 
improvement in handling is fantastic.  The whole front end is tighter and 
stays flatter through turns.
