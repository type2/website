&gt; I pulled the engine a bit further apart tonight, and got some pics of
&gt; the 3-4 side combustion chambers.
&gt;
&gt; I have begun to make a to-do list for this engine, and so far it
&gt; reads as follows:
&gt;
&gt; 1. 	A.  Remove the valves and springs.
&gt;      	B.  Check the guides and seats.
&gt; 	C.  Lap the valves.
&gt; 	D.  Reassemble valve train.
&gt;
&gt;2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
&gt;
&gt; 10. Forget about using water injection for the next 5,000 miles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Comments greatly appreciated.

call Boston Bob and get an engine built, probably faster and cheaper.
