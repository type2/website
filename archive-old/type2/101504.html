Subject: 78 Charcoal Canister

The archives contained a lot of info about the purpose of the charcoal
canister but left a few questions hanging regarding replacement:

ETKA lists 175 201 801A as the part number for the charcoal canister for a
78 bus but it also lists that same number for pre-78 models and I know the
canister changed shape in 1978.

Bus Depot sells &quot;Charcoal Filter Canister, Fuel Tank Evaporation, 73-79 Bus
$54.95 175 201 801A&quot;.  What years will this item fit?  The archives make
reference to an ill fitting replacement from VWoA so I'm really curious now.

Looking up any Vanagon in ETKA, the canister depicted is the same shape and
lists the same part number but in addition adds that 175 133 335 is a
replacement.  Doing a parts search this item is described as a cap. Huh?

The Syncro Vanagon seems to use the same shape canister but has a weird part
number 1H0 201 801C. Not being familiar with these, is this a real VW part
number?

I guess my question is, has anyone seen all of these canisters that can sort
out the part number mess?

Also, has anyone refilled the 78 canister with pelletized carbon from the
pet store? I assume it's a sealed unit, designed only for replacement at 30k
miles, so where is the best place to drill a hole in order to glue on
refilling a cap?
