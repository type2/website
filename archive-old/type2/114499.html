Subject: Installing interior wood panels

Folks,
  Well I am finally in the closing phase of the bus resto... (what do 
you mean it's been 3 years)  anyway I have taken all the interior 
panels out and recreated them in wood. Now the problem ...I am trying 
to figure out the best way to attach them to the doors and other walls 
of the bus...I recall there was some discussion about the method of 
fastening but couldn't find anything in the archives that helped me. I 
wonder if just redrilling all the holes and putting in self tapping 
screws would be the way to go but I would love to use the existing 
holes in the body. Has anyone had experience with this??? I am willing 
to try anything at this point :)
Thanks in Advance


Kevin
