Greetings..

Quick question about the solex carb numbering system...

As I understand it, the last number in the carb naming scheme is the
series/version number of that carb.  So a 34 pict 5 would be a later model
carb than the 34 pict 3.  Correct?

So does that mean the 34 pict 5 is a better performing (new, out of the box)
carb than a similarly new 34 pict 3?  Or are they different carbs altogether
and not interchangeable?

Cheers,
