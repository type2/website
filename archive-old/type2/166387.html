Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

&gt;If the exhaust is leaking at the head, then the O2 being sucked into

&gt;According to this page:

&gt;
&gt;cherry red, visible at night may be as low as 800F. Not impossible

Right. If you were seeing red in the daylight, then fuel combusting is not contained to the combustion chamber.

From my own measurements, under normal running conditions, the pipes are:

- 700F as where the head meets the exhaust pipe
- 500F on the way to the heaterbox through the afterburner pipe (75-78)
- 300F at the muffler

&gt;stripping off the heat sink and removing the forced air cooling may have
&gt;something to do with the pipes getting hotter. Heater boxes not only heat
&gt;the air for the cabin, they strip the heat from the exhaust.

I'm sure it's making the exhaust hotter at least.

Heater Boxes are 140F at the muffler end and 190F at the exit which shows off the insulating properties of the HE.
