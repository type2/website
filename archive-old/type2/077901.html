Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap FI ECU/AFM replacement!

I'd like to point out again that this is a 'Do It Yourself' situation. No
one is selling assembled units. The user must assemble and install and
modify as need be for a certain application. The SW is complete and the
source/development tools are available on the MegaSquirt web site referenced
below. The only mod I plan on making to the SW for my application is to tune
for volumetric efficiency and to modify the accecleration enrichment code to
use changes in manifold pressure rather than throttle position changes (the
stock VW bus FI does not have a throttle position sensor and I don't plan on
cobbling one on).

I think it would be great to have enough aircooled folks using this setup so
that we can develop a certain level of support via this list. I really think
this is a good long term solution for many of the failing FI systems out
there.

I would be glad to provide support via email or this list to anyone who is
planning on jumping into this. Unfortunately the group-buy of kits just
closed. I'm sure another will hapen at some point - but for now the only
source for a PCB is kits via this group-buy - or to order your own PCB's
from board fabricator (the files for the board layout are also available via
the MegaSquirt web site).

If someone is really interested in getting one of the $100 unassembled kits,
they may be able to score one by monitoring the MegaSquirt yahoo group
(referenced below) and see if any one is dropping out of the group-buy or
will be selling theirs for some reason or another.

&gt; That's an awesome idea!  I'd love to play/help out with the program.
&gt; Need an beta testers?  100 bux isn't bad at all..

&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought I'd share my future FI plans with the list. Perhaps other
folks
&gt; &gt; with FI problems would be interested.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was planning on engineering my own FI control module to replace the
&gt; &gt; ECU/AFM on my bus. I've wrestled with the stock FI setup a couple of
times
&gt; &gt; now - and while I understand it very well I'm unhappy with how time
&gt; &gt; consuming and expensive tracking down a problem and repairing is. After
I
&gt; &gt; had a design roughed out on paper I found someone else that had done
very
&gt; &gt; much just what I had planned - with even more neat tuning functionality
than
&gt; &gt; I had planned. This controller was designed by Bruce Bowling and Al
Grippo
&gt; &gt; who are part of a DIY EFI group. The HW and SW design is complete and
they
&gt; &gt; have a web site where the whole design exists - free for use by any
&gt; &gt; Do-It-Yourself'ers:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.bgsoflex_dot_com/megasquirt.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is also a yahoo group for discussion of the MegaSquirt:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/megasquirt/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me add some info regarding this controller and FI VW busses:
&gt; &gt; - It would replace your ECU, AFM, cold star valve, thermo time switch,
&gt; &gt; double relay, wiring harness, and balast resistors
&gt; &gt; - It would utilize your existing injectors, fuel pump, and pressure
&gt; &gt; regulator.
&gt; &gt; - It needs to be tuned for each style engine based on Volumetric
Efficiency
&gt; &gt; (VE).
&gt; &gt; - It costs about $100 in parts and perhaps another $50 for parts for
wiring
&gt; &gt; harness as well as an oxy sensor.
&gt; &gt; - The controller needs to be build yourself - as well as the wiring
harness,
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bruce and Al sponsored a group-buy of all the components - as well as
the
&gt; &gt; PCB and case. I was able to sneak in on the tail end of this group buy
and
&gt; &gt; so in a few months I may have one up and running on my bus. There seems
to
&gt; &gt; be quite a bit of interest in this design - so I assume that someone
will
&gt; &gt; sponsor another group-buy in the future.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think this is a great way to utilize parts of our existing FI setup -
&gt; &gt; while updating to something that will be more maintainable (time and
money
&gt; &gt; wise!) in the future. Of course it will require a fair amount of
&gt; &gt; soldering/fabrication skills to implement, so it certainly is not for
&gt; &gt; everyone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Questions/comments are welcome.
