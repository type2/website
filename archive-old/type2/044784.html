Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?

Hi,

If you go for a 75 or newer engine with a 228 mm clutch, you will have an
interference problem with the transmission bell housing.  I used the 74 215 mm
flywheel and clutch on my 2.0 liter in my 74.  I have always been very easy on my
clutches and usually get 100k miles or more from them
