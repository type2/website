Subject: RE: [T2] Tinted rear and side glass for sale

&gt;They look great, not so dark you can't see through them, just a nice grey.
Real classy. There is even an aftermarket window defroster for the rear
available here http://tinyurl_dot_com/pxakh that I plan on installing on mine.



I just realized that the company that is marketing the defroster kit is
located in my hometown.  I'm gonna go check them out this week and I'll
report back.
