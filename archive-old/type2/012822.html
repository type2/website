&gt; The one on my 71 Westy consists of a length of heavy angle iron to which the
&gt; hitch is mounted.  The angle iron bolts underneath the frame rails at the
&gt; back, in front of the bumper.  I could take some pix possibly in the next few
&gt; days if needed.  It is plenty strong enough to tow a small trailer.  Sorry,
&gt; my hitch is not for sale.


I have one on my web site, pictures and all. It is for sale and fits a 68-71.
It is under the for sale page.
