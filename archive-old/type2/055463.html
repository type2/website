Subject: Re: Where do you work on your VW?

&gt;Right now I live in an apartment with an unheated, unlit, shared
&gt;garage that is completely unsuitable for any sort of work or storage
&gt;of my tools.  Hopefully, jobs allowing, we will be moving soon to a
&gt;new place with a garage, but if not, I may have to rough it here for
&gt;a while.  I'm curious what kind of rotten locations people have had
&gt;to do resto or mechanical work on their VWs.  This was inspired by a
&gt;story in VW trends that said the guy had painted his bug in a
&gt;carport!  If I did that I would have a paintjob with 5000 bugs and
&gt;chucnks of dirt in it.  Looked great though.
&gt;
&gt;So where do you do your work... and what methods have you used to get
&gt;around cruddy working conditions?
&gt;

In the street.  It sucks, but in SoCal (Hollywood) it's not SO bad.  I keep
most of my tools in my curtained Westy.  I haven't had a decent place to
work since 1992, and I had just started getting into restoration
(motorcycles) at the time.  When I move in March or April, I'm making a
garage a priority.
