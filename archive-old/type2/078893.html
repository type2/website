Subject: Re: [T2] IRC

Mike (and all),

The nakenchat appears to be a web based chat server/client combo.
Problem is that it runs in part off the server.  At present, for security
reasons, *nothing* runs off the server except the list, the web pages, and
secure shell for the admins.

With any of the non-irc chat variants out there (instant messenger, ICQ,
naken, etc.) you have to deal with various OS and firewall problems.  IRC
is old, IRC is dumb, and almost everyone can run IRC.  As a result it is
the lowest-common-denominator way to talk.  It lacks bells and whistles,
but it works, no matter what.

If you want to IRC, the most common (of hundreds of available) clients
are:

for M$:     Mirc   (http://www.mirc_dot_com/)
for Mac:    Ircle  (http://www.ircle_dot_com/)
for Unix:   BitchX (http://www.bitchx_dot_org/)

Most unix shell accounts have irc present by default, I dunno about any of
the others... once you have a client installed, the server is irc.mit_dot_edu
and the channel to join is #buslist.  No one there now (and I am headed
for bed), but show up between 0100 and 0400 UCT and someone will be along
within 30 minutes.

I am a bit of a techno-luddite (see the .sig :-)... still use a unix
shell, still read mail in pine, still have not gotten a virus/worm! I rest
my case :-)
