&gt;A week or three ago, I wrote up a whole long diatribe about what to do if
&gt;you have an unknown engine that would not start, covering checking
&gt;air-gas-compression and spark.  I CAN'T FIND IT NOW!!!  :-((((((
&gt;
&gt;Did anyone save it?  Can you bounce me a copy?

here you go steve,

Michael,
To get a non-running bus started when you are lost, you need to check the
four things you need for a running engine:
Fuel -
FI -
Check fuel pressure while cranking
Fuel pressure = 32PSI?
Check fuel delivery to cylinders.
Pull fuel rails away from the intake manifolds and run them into paper
cups - are all 4 spraying during cranking ? good pattern?
Carb - (not my forte')
Check for flow from gas pump into a paper cup.
Check for accelerator pump function
set initial adjustments per Bentley/Muir
Air -
Manually check *all* vacuum hose connections Take 'em off and put them
back on.
Check vacuum while cranking, should be at least 10&quot;
New air filter
FI-
Check throttle body butterfly
Carb -
check choke and throttle butterflies,
Compression -
Valves = .006?
compression = 90+ in all 4 cold?
Spark
Dwell = 50 *exactly*
Verify by observation that #1TDC is *really* #1TDC
Timing = 7.5 BTDC static (don't matter what dist, for this excercise,
trust me, 7.5 vor static)
Pull the plugs and ground the base. Watch for spark.
If you do all these, your engine will start. The problem is to actually
do them without &quot;knowing&quot; any is correct and skipping that step. It's
really hard, you have to trust me. Cover all the bases and the ump will
score the run, miss *any* base, and you're out :-)
I hate even to point these out, as you will skip the above and head
straight for them (don't *DO* that!!!) but I suspect
(a) a bad ground for the FI under the air dist box, at the trans, or
at the double relay or
(b) that the dist drive gear may be out of place.
Even if you find one of these, tho... run thru the whole list, in order,
please!
