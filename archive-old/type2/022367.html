&gt;I know this has been talked about before but I couldn't
&gt;find a good answer.  I am looking for a new battery and wonder
&gt;if it mattered what one I buy. I asked a guy at Autozone to check
&gt;the price on a battery for my bus and he said the only one that
&gt;would work is $50.  After looking through the archive I saw some people saying get a group 24 battery. The bently says I need a 54
&gt;amp hours battery.
&gt;Anyone got any suggestions on what kind to buy?
&gt;As in specs not brands, what works?

I have lots of auxiliary battery power in my bus so I went for a cheap starting battery.  I got a $29 WalMart special - the size was fourty-something-F (can't look at it at the moment).  Works great and fits well.  Be sure to get one with the reverse terminal layout (There is a F appended to the size, to designate Ford? on the reverse terminal batteries).

Specs - cold cranking amps are not really that important in a bus.  A bus has a relatively small starter that draws relatively low current compared to the monster starters on V-8 American cars.  You don't need a 1000CCA battery.  Of course, if you live where it gets really cold, you can never have too many cold cranking amps.

If you want a quality battery, here is my opinion, two cents, whatever.  Worth what you paid for it.

1)  If you're unconcerned with weight, get a group 27 battery.  It will fit, it has lots of cranking amps/reserve capacity/amp hours.
2) Get a Motocraft or Interstate battery.  They are made by Johnson Controls and I have had nothing but good experiences with their batteries.
3) Avoid anything made by Exide, or anything with &quot;Die Hard&quot; on the label, especially the Die Hard Gold.  I've had nothing but bad experiences with their batteries.

If you are lucky enough to have an Auto Parts Club in your area, they carry group 27 Motocraft batteries for under $50.  Fabulous deal.
