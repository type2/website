Subject: Re: Mystery oil leak

If it's really not the main seal or o-ring it could be
the cam plug. If it's neither then you might have a
cracked case. I've had a couple of cases crack and
they're tough to diagnose because the crack seems to
close up when the engine cools off.

&gt;It's coming from between the engine and tranny. I can
&gt;see the oil build up before it drips and it's a
&gt;little right of the case seam. My case seems pretty
&gt;crappy, but I've got a hunch that it's not coming
&gt;from the seam
