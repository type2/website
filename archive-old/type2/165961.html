  **Not necessarily. They are out there.  I have one coming up for sale. And, the asking price will be much less than even half that.  And, in our local VW community, we just facilitated a sale for a very nice 70 deluxe SR for $1500. Granted it's a 70 and not a 71, and a bit underpriced, but.... the point is to say that the value is not what that seller thinks it is. It is important to keep things realistic.
