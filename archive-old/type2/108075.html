Subject: [T2] compression #'s to good to be true?

I consistantly got 130+ on all cylinders on an engine that had been in the
bus for a long, long time. Compression held up while the valvve seats
dropped and the rods got loose.

I adjusted my hydraulic valves yesterday to Bentley spec at 2 turns in, so
today I decided to check the compression since it hasnt been done since I
bought the bus almost a year ago. The test was done with the engine warm and
with WOT. Well, I got quite the surprise. The measurements were:
#1-135
#2-140
#3-140
#4-140
