Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Fuel Injector Bolt

&gt; So, I'm changing the rings and hose on my fuel injectors. ('76 westy,
&gt; 2.0L non-Cali) Finished up the last injector, put it back in the hole,
&gt; line up the ring, put the nut on, tighten it down....  and the bolt pops
&gt; out of its hole.  Hmmm...
&gt;
&gt; Now, I'm not sure if the bolt sheared off, or if the hole is stripped.
&gt; The bolt only turns for a couple threads, but that's not enough to hold
&gt; it in place when I tighted down the nut.  Either way I figure I'm in for
&gt; it, 'cause I'm probably going to have to replace the manifold tubes.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a spare one of these injector bolts, and can tell me
&gt; how long it's supposed to be?

thier not all that big, since they are rarely messed with and don't have
to be torqued to 5,000ftlbs I would try something like J-B Weld on it, let
it sit a while then try it again tightening it down very gently to correct
torque.
&gt;
&gt; Also, it looks like a tight fit getting to the bolts that hold on the
&gt; manifold tubes.  Is it even possible to take those off without dropping
&gt; the engine?

yes they will come out, lots of wiggling and contortions
