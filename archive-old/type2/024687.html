Subject: Engine bill of health?

Oh mighty and experienced list members, what can you conclude about the
health of my engine from these various bits of information:

Just did a compression test (cold):
	no oil		oil added to cylinder (about 2tsp)
#1	85		125
#2	90		125
#3	80		125
#4	80		122

Not sure if cold compression tests are comparable to hot, but I didn't have
time to take her out and warm it up, so I'm hoping there's some useful
information here.

Also, check http://phosphorous.cyberarts_dot_com/Niall/plugs.jpg (plugs in order
from left to right #1 - #4) - little fuzzy, but may be able to get some
info.  The plugs have about 1500 miles on them.  I've never really been able
to interpret plug color from those pictures in the manuals, having not
enough experience looking at plugs, I guess.

Thanks,
Niall (Frances '76 Westy)
