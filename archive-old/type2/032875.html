Subject: 69 westy interior 90+% complete!

I've posted it before, but it HAS TO GO.  I have to have all my cars (2
rabbits, 2 buses...plus my brothers rabbit, and a falcon..) gone by y2k...


69 westy interior, sink/icebox/watertank jump seat bed closet, spare tire
cover, curtain rods, front cot and clips, jalousie windows w/ screens and
suround rubber, side table and leg and floor clip, and what3ever else goes
with it.

I'd really love to get 300 dollars for it. but i'll settle for the best
offer!

Also available are all of the roof panels, as well as the wooden wall/door
panels. soso to great shape.  Also complete 69 popto and rack, as well as

Delivery within georgia/s. carolina is possibly feasable for more $.;)

else you arrange pickup/delivery.
