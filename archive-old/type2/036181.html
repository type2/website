What about Porsche 944 brakes? 
They are popular with the Super Beetle crowd because they are pretty much a bolt-on upgrade. Due to the similarity in rear axle design at least the rear discs might be an option for a bus maybe even the front ones.
I have been thinking about this myself but have not done any field research on it yet. I use my camper to tow car trailers (up to 1.6 tons) and at times the stock brakes seem to be insufficient for that.
