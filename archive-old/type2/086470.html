Subject: extractor exhaust

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1F5B0.0552DB90

Hey everyone,
    A little new at this and needed some advice.  Hope you can help.  I h=
ave a rebuilt 1971 upright 1600 going in my early bay.  I have a complete=
 exhaust system minus the damper pipe bracket.  It is all new old stock, =
oem, German.  Having a bit of trouble locating those little sleeves that =
go into the heater hoses, and into the exhaust.  The stock exhaust seems =
to be quite a hassle to get lined up, and tight.  I am thinking about jus=
t going with an extractor style system.  Looks much easier, and since my =
bus will only be driven in the summer, I really do not need heat that muc=
h.  I have no thermostat, linkage, or flaps in the shroud for just that r=
eason.  Can anyone tell me if I should bite the bullet and stay stock?  A=
lso, was wondering if I did get the extractor style, could I use the stin=
ger?  Is it legal to go with no muffler and just the stinger?  And last b=
ut not least, anyone recommend where besides Rocky Mountain Motorworks, I=
 can get such a system?  Talked to Bus Depot, and all exhaust parts I nee=
d are on national backorder, with no ETR.  Thank you.                    =
               This is a great list!!!!!Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN =
