I have replaced the master cylinder that was leaking and bled the brake
lines. However, the brakes act as they did before. When I apply the brakes
the pedal gives and feels spongy when I press it again the pedal is higher
and feels solid.
When I bled the brakes the fluid was dark and I bled them until I got clear
fluid. Do I need to bleed them more? What else could cause the soft pedal?
Pads and shoes are not worn. The only thing that is out of wack is the
parking brake which will not hold even though I have adjusted it to the
fullest extent. Could this be allowing the rear shoes to return too far?
Any ideas?
