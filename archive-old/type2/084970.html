Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy

I'd love to create some radio transmitter that would overcome the stereo in 
the next thumper car that came along and help them appear to tell the world 
all their inner secrets at top volume. Some sort of Buck Rogers transmitter 
ray gun...

I'll never forget a large truck in Italy that had such a high power 
transmitter on his radio (would it still be a CB in Italy?) that he broke 
into what I was listening to on the tape deck in my car.

Sounded like an Italian speaking devil - all deep and rumbling. I did not 
know what it was at first and it scared the hell out of me!!!
