Subject: Still Purring w/ couple problems

Hello everyone!
Me again...

I drove the bus today for around a total of 250 miles.  It ran great! I had 
one problem...

The front seal behind the Fan Hub is leaking pretty good.  Mind you this is 
a rebuilt engine.  I don't want to be alarmed, but how rare is it for this 
seal to leak so quick?

Should I be concerned or just change it out?

I plan to remove the Fan Pulley in the morning to get access to the fan hub 
to confirm this is what is leaking.  Is there anything special I need to do? 
  I did not put grease around the hub before I pressed it on...Should I 
have?
Is it possible I put too many miles too soon?

My generater light stays on too.  I checked the charging system myself 
before I headed out today.  And then again at a shop a hundred miles into my 
drive.  Both times charging system was fine.  Light comes on with key in the 
&quot;On&quot; position...But, when I turn the engine over the light stays on.  If I 
turn on the head lights the gen light will go out.  If I am running head 
lights on and on low beam it will come back on.  But if head lights are on 
with High Beam...Gen light goes out...
Can any of you elec. experts give me a clue on what to check passed the 
Alt., VR, and Battery.

Thanks!
Lo
