I think that oil leak came standard on all 77 buses.  Mine has it too.  I
replaced the pushrod tubes and seals, gave it new rocker gaskets, used rtv,
and am now on rubber gaskets.  I think maybe my bales might be loose, but I
still can't get them on or off by hand.  Mine leaks from both sides, by the
way, but more on the passenger side.  It's getting to be like my old F_at_rd.
That car used to run for weeks on just the gunk that was caked inside it.  It
literally ran without oil.
