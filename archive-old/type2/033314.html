Subject: for those with non-vw engines

this is for those of you that have an engine in the back of your bus that is
not vw.  i have a 72 westy with a bad motor.  motor is out and have partialy
begun the rebuild.  i also have a subaru engine out and ready to bolt in
with the correct kennedy adapters.  i would like to hear from those of you
who have used a sooby motor in a bus.  the adapter plate is fairly
inexpensive and bolts directly to the tranny.  it should be a brainless swap
(of course its never as easy as it seems).  unless someone wants to buy the
westy for 6-700 bucks i need to decide on an engine to put in it.

thanks
