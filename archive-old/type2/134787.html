Subject: upgraded visor clips

I recently replaced my missing and broken visor clips with a
stronger locking style visor clip. Here's a couple of pics.

If anyone is interested I could put together some sets.
The mailers and postage are the real killers, so it would
probably be better to sell 4 clips (2 pairs) at a time.  I'm guessing
around $6 per set shipped, or $10 for 2 pair shipped.

White is the only color available. I'll get more details out if
anyone wants them.
