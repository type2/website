Subject: Re: [T2] Still won't start 75 bus- 2 injector questions-

Mike,

IIRC, injectors are switched by suppling *ground* to them, not positive 
juice.

Your test should be a good one....make damn sure ya got your extinguisher 
handy and someone else to crank while you watch.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The 75 bus will still not start, and I did properly check the fuel
&gt; pressure (40, with or without vac hose on the regulator, but it drops

&gt; checked the injectors with a test light and they do flicker when the
&gt; leads are inserted into both plug connectors.  What's odd is that
&gt; checking the light from ground to either plug tertminal (ignition on
&gt; only) shows + current to each one- how can this be if the terminals are
&gt; for the solenoid in the injector?  Injectors show ok resistance across
&gt; terminals so I assume there is no discontinuity.  Is it possible all 4
&gt; injectors are blocked (did have old stabilized gas in lines for about 7
&gt; years, and it did start poorly in the past.)-  I have spare injectors
&gt; and thought I'd try this as a diagnosis- hook up a spare injector to
&gt; fuel rail TEE.  Attach the nearest injector plug.  Crank.  If all else
&gt; is proper, it should show a spray pattern?
