Subject: [T2] Questions about my first van

Hello all,

I have just bought my first vehicle - a '72 Van. Well, problem is, I don't know
too much about cars, and there is plenty wrong with my van. Alas, I love it
dearly, so I'm wanting to fix it up as best I can. My problems lie as follows:

 - It won't idle upon first starting, I've got to warm it up for a minute or so,
then she'll idle. 
 - Just in this last week, I got about 5 miles to the gallon, whereas the
previous week, I got 26. 


Ya, that's pretty much it for now. I have access to a mechanics shop at school,
so I have equipment to undertake major endeavors, but I just don't know where to
start.  Any help would be appreciated. 

Ian
~'72 Van

(Ps. I read people writing Westy, assuming that means wesfalia, how do I tell if
I have a westfalia or other model?)
