&gt; So here is the timing question: What should my advance be if I'm running
an 1800
&gt; AW code motor, with a (1974, 1976-1978) &quot;california&quot; distributor #0 231
170 093?
&gt; (there's only one port on the biscuit)   My guess is 5 degrees after tdc,
as i
&gt; have a manual tranmission. Anyone want to throw their .02 into the game?

Set it at 7.5 before since you have the manual trans. Only with the auto
trans in 74 did it set at 5 after. 5 after is too retarded for your engine.
