 This is wrong. The retard goes to the manifold&lt;&lt;

Well, somebody is wrong... according to the article in
the Type2 library, this is the correct way. This is
how I have always heard is right! Here's the snippet
from the Library article:

&gt;&quot;Over the years, many a 71-74 Beetle and 71 Bus with
Dual Diaphragm Distributors have graced my doors and
about half the time the vacuum lines are backwards. So
here's the poop: 

First, take a look at your Vacuum can. On the flat
side of the can is a hose fitting - for the larger
(4.5mm GREEN) hose. This is the RETARD side. 

Second, on the cone (or rounded) side of the can is
the smaller hose fitting. This uses a 3.5mm hose,
usually black. This is the ADVANCE side. 

Third, look at your 34PICT Carburetor. The fitting on
the LEFT side of the carb is for the ADVANCE side of
your Vaccum can. Connect appropriately. 

Fourth, look at your 34PICT Carb again. On the rear
(RIR) of the carb should be a fitting up towards, but
not on the carburetor top. This push-on fitting is
just slightly larger than then one on the side. This
is for your RETARD side of your Vacuum can. Connect
appropriately with the 4.5mm Green Hose. &quot;&lt;

So which is it? Who can sya definitively???
