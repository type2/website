&gt;this is one of the things i love about tirerack -
&gt;they are also affiliated with thousands of tire stores/dealers around
&gt;the USA. you can even get the tires drop-shipped to a tire shop &amp; then
&gt;just drive up there to have them put on. this would certainly eliminate
&gt;the out-of-town-emergency hassle part of the equation.

I've had this done twice and both times it worked out w/o any 
problems.  I've used the Tire Rack  about 4 times since 1986 and have never 
had a problem with them.
