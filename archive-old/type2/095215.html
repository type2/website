Subject: Re: [T2] more painting and bodywork and stuff

Jennifer,

Try http://www.tptools_dot_com. They have some &quot;how-to&quot; and &quot;tips&quot; articles on 
their site, plus they're a good supplier of the equipment and materials.

Good luck...

Sean,

&gt;What is hvlp? Is this stuff covered (in a simple, step-by-step mannor) in a 
&gt;website somewhere?  I'd really like this to look nice, but I have a &quot;want&quot; 
&gt;to do it all myself, even if it's not as good as a professional (this is my 
&gt;version of fun).
&gt;Thanks to all,

&gt;Jennifer
