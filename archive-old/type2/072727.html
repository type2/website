Rocky Mt. Motorworks new catalog shows  new (old style) window swaamp
coolers.  Both with fan and with out.  They're not cheap $400-550.
I plan to make my own this next month.  Details to follow to the list when
I'm done.

&gt;     Somebody told me about a small window airconditioner made for
&gt;campers -- anybody know anything about them? They're 110v, of course.
