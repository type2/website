Subject: Re: [T2] Need help insuring Westy in Texas

All of my family's cars (including 59 Bug and Bus) are under State Farm and
have not seen a raise on our rates... good service and coverage :)

----- Original Message -----
&gt; The latest Consumer Reports has a report on insurance and it basically
&gt; states that rates have risen not because of an increase in accidents or
9/11
&gt; but because the stock market has fallen and the investments they use to
&gt; offset the cost of underwriting can't support the current premiums.
