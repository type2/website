It's just another style of painting except it's thick so make sure the
halves still bolts together evenly and the fan doesn't scrape against it.

To properly clean the shroud you really need to sandblast it which is
mandatory for powdercoating. I had mine blasted but I painted it myself so I
could choose the paint color later (the powdercoater didn't have to largest
selection of paint colors and no painted samples other than paper swatches).

After sandblasting the finish is rough and grayish:

The sandblasting leave a lot of pitting because the casting technique VW
used left air pockets. The sandblaster called it a pot-metal.

I think I put on 4 coats of a locally bought engine enamel.

Dull aluminim was the color I used. I couldn't figure out the real color at
the time. After cleaning another shroud recently without sandblasting to
remove all of the corrosion it appears to have been silvery.
