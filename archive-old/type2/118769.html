Subject: re: re: westy outdoor car cover/winter storage?

|From: &quot;Russ Neithammer&quot; &lt;rneithammer_at_mlea_dot_com&gt;

|Actually, getting the cover on and off the bus is easy, even with one
|person.


Russ,
Wow. With that in mind I might reconsider getting a cover for the bus. The car
cover for my small car doesn't have grommet holes to tie to so I do have
problems in the wind without two people. Did your cover come with grommet
holes or did you add them? What kind of cover is it and where did you get it?
Thanks,
Bill
