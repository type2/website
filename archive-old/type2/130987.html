Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

I agree.

Yea it's a GEX engine but hey it's a complete running engine right? Why not 
do adjust valves, do a compression test, check for endplay, and get a feel 
for what condition it's in? Check everything out before you drop it, test 
the gen and stuff. Replace that oil cooler seal while messing with the 
cooling issue at the same time for sure.

I think you could turn it into a strong driver without much money at all - 
don't be discouraged and assume you have to immediately replace the entire 
engine just because it's GEX. And from that pic the bus looks pretty solid, 
especially for being from New Jersey (when I first read that I was confused 
why you were going to NJ to pick up a bus).

Oh and Blake, you are from Savannah right? Know any good campgrounds on or 
near the beach?

&gt;I would straighten out the cooling issues and keep the maintenance up to 
&gt;date and see what &gt;happens.
