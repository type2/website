Subject: 71 Westy Happy Bus

As a new, very new owner, what is everyones opinion on body filler?  
Happy has a tremendous amount of filler, rivited floor panels, but darn 
does she look good.  Is this body work acceptable to the purist?  And 
about the paint scheme, I would like to add a &quot;V&quot; Nose two tone paint 
job in the future.  Is this considered appropiriate to the purist?
Thanx to all
FEBIII
71 Happy Bus
