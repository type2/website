Folks:
I am about to embark a voyage of resetting my torsion bars. In preparation
for this adventure, I purchased an angle measurement tool at Home Depot. It
keeps telling me my bus is as level as a proverbial playing field, but I
know darn well it's not. Any fool can see that. I have one of the worst
cases of butt sag going on (in the bus) that you have ever seen. Perhaps it
isn't supposed to be level?

I know you subtract (or add, I forget which) the reading taken from a frame
rail from the reading taken at the spring plate, but if I have a big fat
zero reading at the frame rail, then I ain't got squat to subtract (or add
as the case may be).

Any advice on this procedure is welcome. And yes, I checked the garage
floor. It ain't far from level itself.

Thanks
Bob
