Subject: Re: [T2] 1st it got hot then oil pressure started going down!

This distributor has only the advance vacuum diaphragm, so thanks for the
reassurance on the 7.5 BTDC. I am the rebuilder so no warranty :(. I am using a
new VDO gauge and sender. I know this is no guarantee that it is accurate, and
I don't have any spares for comparison. I didn't realize 8 to 10 PSI at idle is
acceptable. The documentation for the pressure sender indicates the contact for
the pressure light closes at 8 PSI, so I guess I'm going to see it blink on at
idle now and then.

During the rebuild I tried to be meticulous on all measurements. All clearances
seemed well within tolerance. Not 100% sure on clearances of the oil pump
though didn't seem worn though. Hardly perceptible backlash on the gears and
end play in tolerance. Is there anything else I should have looked for?

I am thinking about checking the oil pressure relief valve. If the spring is
weak would that cause low pressure at idle? How can I check the strength of the
spring, should it exert x Lbs of pressure when compressed x distance?

Thanks so much for your opinion Doctor Tim,
Tom

&gt; If you have both advance and retard vacuum hoses hooked up as stock and you
&gt; set dynamic timing to 7.5° BTDC, you are way too far advanced. If you set
&gt; 7.5° static, then with the retard in play, dynamically you should see the
&gt; stock setting of 10 to 5° ATDC. If the retard hose is not hooked up, then
&gt; 7.5° BTDC dynamic is correct.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, you were not overheating at 180°F, and the loss of oil pressure
&gt; is a bad sign after a few short miles. Discuss this with your rebuilder
&gt; before doing anything else to make sure you preserve your warrenty. Follow
&gt; the advice of the rebuilder. I wouldn't be to concerned with 8-10 lbs at
&gt; hot idle, but it should jump right up to 25+ when hot at 2500+ rpm. Before
&gt; pulling the motor, I would want to verify the accuracy of the pressure
&gt; guage to be sure.

&gt; &gt;I now have 8 miles on my newly rebuilt 2000 liter engine. It is in a 75
&gt; &gt;bus using all the 75 fuel injection parts. The distributor is from the
&gt; &gt;78 part# 021-905-205P. Timing set at 7.5 btdc. Straight 30 wt Valvoline
&gt; &gt;oil. Took it out for the first real ride this morning to fill the tank,
&gt; &gt;about 3 miles round trip. Seemed fine both directions. Oil pressure
&gt; &gt;around 30 psi. oil temp never got above 170. Checked the flaps and they
&gt; &gt;never opened on this run. About 1 hour later I went to the store 2.5
&gt; &gt;miles away. Ran great. same oil pressure, temps got to almost 180.
&gt; &gt;Stayed in the store maybe 15 minutes. About half way home didn't seem to
&gt; &gt;have much power when I hit second gear. Pressure was down to about
&gt; &gt;20-22. Temp was slightly above 180. Continued home, The last block is up
&gt; &gt;hill maybe 3 degrees. Hardly any power in second gear had to go to first
&gt; &gt;to make the hill. As I crested the hill I think I noticed the oil light
&gt; &gt;flash on for just a second. OH SH**. Oil press just below 10 when I
&gt; &gt;looked at the gauge. Temp a little above 180.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It's cooling in the drive now. Any ideas? Rechecked Old Volks Home for
&gt; &gt;distributor specs. They say 7.5 deg is right. Vacuum leak maybe? All
&gt; &gt;help is most appreciated.
