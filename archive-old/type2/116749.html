Subject: AFM interchangability

Hello,

I purchased a &quot;spare&quot; AFM from someone that said they had pulled if off of a 
76 bus to use on their 77, and it worked great.

anyway, long story short, they sent me this :l
http://imagehost.vendio_dot_com/bin/imageserver.x/00000000/christophercs/AFM.jpg

part number 025-906-301

from what I found, this is an AFM for a 83-85 waterboxer. can you use these 
on a baywindow,
what is the real difference?

from the looks of it, the only difference is in the CO adjuster, as this one 
is an allen adjuster,
while mine is just a standard screw.
