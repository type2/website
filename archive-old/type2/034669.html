Hi, I am trying to sell for cheap an extremely rust free 71 bus missing
the engine and trans and having bad right rear corner damage.  It has
complete clean pink slip and registration without any problems (it's
paid up as registered non-op, no fees to pay and legal for towing) All
the left side and front and rear left side corners are absolutely
pristine condition, not a single scratch or ding in the original faded
red paint, and absolutely the least rust of any 71 you will ever find
anywhere, I mean not a speck on the floor (was a garaged
car for its first 15 years by the original owner).  This makes it useful

for being a donor car on any projects that need a &quot;skin graft&quot; or front
floor replacement or the left side corners. Wiring is intact.   I would
point out that the wider wheels with hubs and axles including the power
disc brakes can be traded into 68-70 cars, plus the doors have good
window regulators (crank hardware).  I just towed it back and forth to
Vallejo from Berkeley so I could deliver it to locations within 100
miles of SF if you'r
interested.  I'd like to get $100 for it and you get the towbar (bolt up
for 68-71 type 2) for another $50.

Call Tom at 510-527-3730 or respond via email asap, I'm trying to
dispose of it fast.
