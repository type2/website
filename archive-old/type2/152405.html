Subject: Re: [T2] Power loss after fitting new mechanical fuel pump

Stephen,
The new Brazilian Brosol pump has a vertical outlet. It looks
different from the original German pump. Nothing wrong with that.

The amount of fuel delivered by the mechanical fuel pump has to do
with the travel of the pump diaphragm. If it does not travel enough ,
not enough fuel gets into the carb when then engine is hungry.

To remedy you need to get the correct length pushrod for the pump
and/or adjust the height of the fuel pump. I am not good at explaining
these things, the book will tell you better. However I'd bet it's not
the pump - it's the setup.

- Arnaud

Things sounded great at idle/on the level, but at
&gt; speed or uphill suddenly have power loss, which feels very like running
&gt; out of fuel. I have noticed two things. First, the pump does not look
&gt; like the picture on the box - the outlet nozzle is vertical, rather than
&gt; horizontal.
