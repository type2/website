Subject: BN4 heater controls

Listees:
I'm getting ready to install a BN4 but I'm missing the dash mounted timer as
well as the on/off switch. The Eberspacher manual that Espar sent me also
shows a cab thermostat available. I think the best installation would have
both of these installed in series. The timer would prevent the heater from
being inadvertently left on and the thermostat would allow the heater to cycle
to maintain a preset temp.

I would appreciate any advice on this installation and if anyone has a source
for these control devices please email me asap.

Thanks in advance,
Joel '71 Denver and '79 in Baltimore at http://home.attbi_dot_com/~jplusby/
