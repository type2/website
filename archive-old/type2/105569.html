&gt;I read
&gt;Bartnik's explanation of how the cold start valve
&gt;works, so I don't think that is the problem.

Unless it's leaking the cold start valve is only active during starting.

&gt;I just had the engine rebuilt, and everything else is
&gt;grand! Just needs to warm up a bit! Doesn't seem to
&gt;matter if I let it set and warm up or just start
&gt;driving. Still the same results. 

See if your temp sensor II is within spec:
