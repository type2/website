Go to www.bostonengine_dot_com there are some break in tips there.......

Not to knock the shop I hope they truly are great, but look and ask while
they are working if they are installing the thermostat and flaps.  There are
a lot of people that think this stuff is not needed...........if they say
no, insist they put it on...if you have to lie, say that you travel in the
North a lot in the winter to avoid arguments.  Seen a lot of work from shops
that you would never think would take off that stuff and do..........

An engine is only as good as it's weakest link.  Be certain that a new pilot
bearing was installed in the end of the crank, a new clutch pressure plate
was installed, a rear seal in the tranny was put in (unless your tranny was
rebuilt.  Also, if you have any kind of shift linkage issues, or just want
to rebuild the shift rod toor change the coupler...now is the
time..............also, you may want to look at the gas tank while the
engine is out........have it cleaned/coated if you want, but at least
replace the vent lines on top of the tank.

before I went NY to cal, I would really check the brakes...brake stuff is
fairly reasonably priced........

Hope this helps

Subject: [T2] What to expect from a rebuilt engine?


&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Sometime very soon, after over two months at the repair shop, my '78 bus
&gt; with a basic camper conversion will be ready for the summer. I had to have
&gt; the engine rebuilt, among other things, and that is what has caused the
&gt; long, but no doubt worthwhile, delay. I have been equally as long curious
to
&gt; know what I can expect out of a rebuilt engine. This is my first bus (and
&gt; first ACVW in about 10 years) and I haven't even driven it yet so I don't
&gt; even have a drive to the repair shop to go on. I will, of course, talk
with
&gt; the repair shop and try to get an idea of what I can expect out of her,
but
&gt; I am curious to hear from those who have had an engine rebuilt. If the
&gt; repair shop does good work (the repair shop I took it to has 30 years of
&gt; aircooled experience and a good rep to go with that so I'm assuming they
&gt; do), is a rebuilt engine basically as good as a new one, minus the luster?
&gt; Is there any proper way to &quot;break in&quot; a rebuilt engine? Is there anything
I
&gt; should be on the lookout for in the first weeks of driving it? Also, and I
&gt; should have discussed this with the repair shop in advance, but is it
&gt; reasonable to expect some sort of mileage guarantee out of a rebuilt
engine?
&gt; And, lastly, can I drive it from NY to California without worrying about
&gt; anything more than an oil change? =p
&gt;
&gt; Any reports/anecdotes/tips would be must humbly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
