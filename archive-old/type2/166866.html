Subject: Re: [VB] wtb: Westfalia mattress foam

We bought new foam to make the cushions for our '56 westy.... they were
missing.
Called a local foam shop, but it turned out that the dimensions needed were
special, so mail ordered, and it came out to ~ $250 for foam for three pads (2
of one thickness, one of another)B and 2 wedge pillows.B  Though that is not
the same foam needs for a '74.
This was the heavy duty-ier foam suitable for using for sleeping on.
