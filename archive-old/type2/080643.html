I usually go for the stealth philosophy when installing my deck, I
figure most punks take a look in the window prior to busting it and
snatching the stereo.  If all they see is a factory AM radio they may
not bother.  
I had a little extra time on my hands when installing this Kenwood in my
new '71 Westy.

in the '71 Westy folder is a picture of how I mounted it in the glove
box.
 
BTW: the last five pix in this folder were taken this morning, it is the
22nd of May right???
BTW: The green '71 is for sale as well, it's located near Butte Montana
right now, pmail me if you want details.
