  Subject: Re: [T2] Aux. battery relay



  &gt;The Westy wiring diagram says D+ (terminal 61) on the alternator is the
wire
  to use. Should the batteries be connected together if the alternator isn't
  running? &lt;


  I would think that if the batteries are connected while the alternator isn't
running that defeats the purpose of the relay. The relay is suppose to
disconnect the two batteries with the alternator off so that only the aux. is
run down while using the fridge. Then connect the two while it is running to
charge the aux. With the key on I can hear the relay open and close if I touch
it to the + coil post so it is working. I'll try the D+ on the alternator and
see if that does it.
