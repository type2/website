Subject: Relay behind blower fan- where do the wires go?

I have a 76 Westy. I was looking at the relay/box thing behind the blower fan
and noticed it had a black wire running from it not connected to anything. I
have the Bentley, but I don't know what the relay is called, so I don't know
where to look on the wiring diagram. Can someone help me figure out where the
wire goes, or can you tell me where to look on the wiring diagram?

Thanks,

Nik
