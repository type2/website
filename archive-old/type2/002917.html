The recycler just left with the 77.  I thought I would try to provide some
perfectly good parts for some of you, but I'm not in the parts business,
don't want to be in the parts business and certainly don't need any grief
from anyone.  Life is too short and I'm off to enjoy mine!

Best wishes to all
