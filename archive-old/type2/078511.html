Subject: Re: [T2] Group 24 instead of starting batt?

Mike Visket sends:

&gt; I was thinking of putting a Group 24 (80 amp/hr deep cycle) battery in place
&gt; of the current starting battery. Assuming the G24 has the cold-cranking amps
&gt; (CCA) to turn the motor, what problems might I cause by doing this? Anybody
&gt; doing this now?

Deep cycle batteries make sense on a boat that has no alternator--they're
made to be completely discharged over and over, which will damage a regular
car battery. But they're more expensive than regular car batteries. I'd just
put a regular car battery in it.
