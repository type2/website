Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

        I'm with Jeffrey Olson- I'd take a Breadloaf, Vanagon or
93 Eurovan Westie (after raisng the suspension) and drive the
Panamerican Highway, with my wife and our baby when he's sleeping
through the night, but not yet able to get about on his own!

        I'd bring reasonable spares and tools but since this
is a fantasy, all I'd have to do for service is change oil
and wash it. Everytime I checked the tires they'd be ok. I'd
carry two spares and never need to put them on.

        Of course, once the baby is born, I'd likely get much
more conservative and change that plan to touring England,
Scotland and northern Europe at our leasure. Where multiple
doctors and baby supplies are readily available. We'd visit
Brian and his friends and Sarah and her boyfriend and Andy Erskine
and take the ferry to Ireland to meet the Bushrat. :)

        Cheers, all!
        Bill Abbott
