Subject: Re: Kustom Kombi Project - Update

Sounds like a page right out of one of the magazines...

&gt;For those of you who don't know, the Kustom Kombi project is a '66 
&gt;Microbus that I found last week that is virtually rust free and from 
&gt;Calif.  Over the next few months, I am going to be rebuilding it and 
&gt;customizing the heck out of it.

Sano!  Dewd!
