Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene:


&gt;     I use &quot;var-o-sol&quot; (check spelling) in my parts washer. I used to use 
&gt; kerosene, but I find it gets so nasty in everyday use. At any rate I buy 
&gt; them both from the local Exxon distributor (their the guys that sell the 
&gt; gas and oil to the service stations, so any brand will have it), there in 
&gt; the yellow pages under Oil Distributors. Another good thing, it costs less.
&gt;     For a one time use, get few gallons of Diesel fuel, not near the fire 
&gt; hazard as gas, and you can get anywhere, but its still nasty.
&gt;     One other thing, keep in mind where your going to dispose of what 
&gt; every you decide to use, any of it will be &quot;Hazardous waste&quot;. Don't get 
&gt; caught dumping it!

Anything that I can't recycle easily gets poured over the &quot;bills&quot; and 
sticks that are in the burn barrel in the back yard. All goes away.


Ciao!
