Subject: Dbl Cab Canvas

Hey Gang,

I just came across an N.O.S. Canvas top for my 68 Dbl Cab including the 
hoops(hardware).  My question to the list is how much would you Double Cab 
owners be willing to pay for this set-up?  I don't have it for sale but I 
just want to know that what I am paying is in the ballpark.

Trying to avoid a ripoff,


Don
