Subject: Re: [T2] Best Way to Restore Wheels

&lt;Well, I generally think that's right. But that's why the prices of our 
buses are sort of stuck at $4000 at the high end. We don't play by &quot;the 
rules.&quot;

Anyway, it's worth pointing out that on this list, &quot;restore&quot; means 
anything from careful sanding and original paint codes to duct tape. 
That, for better or for worse, sets us apart.&gt;

Go to a Corvette show sometime or get friendly with a Corvette guy. Listen to them talk about the details - debates about the correct chassis paint gloss - or lack there of, picky, picky picky -ness about repalcement part details (not a question of function) and big prices on alot of reproduction parts because the quality has to be just so... 

Yeah, so far the VWs are considered &quot;starter&quot; cars new or old with the big time collectors I've met. 

I STILL think the VW Westfalia is one of the most interesting vintage vehicles on the road. Still quite usable too. 

I'd love to have the time and money to do a &quot;museum quality&quot; VW Westfalia but I want my driver to have certain details &quot;improved&quot; (my way).
