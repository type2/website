&gt; Ok.  Now to clear this up.  Now that I have it narrowed down to 2 engines 
&gt; which one is better for my application.  This bus is going to be a bus that 
&gt; goes around town a few times a week, on the highway very little, and the bus 
&gt; is going to be looking very good.  Partially for show.  In other words it 
&gt; won't be running that much.  If it goes any were it will probably be on the 
&gt; highway and not the town so I guess it will be my trip car.  Now which 
&gt; engine would be better for this instence.  The beettlemex engine or a type4 
&gt; engine???  What are the specs on the engines.  I have some specs on the 
&gt; beetlemex engine but not the type4 engine.  If anybody has any please send 

talking apples and oranges

the Beetlemex engine is ready to run more or less, is cheaper and easier
to work on.

BUT

a two liter fuel injected hyd lifter engine (78) is probably the best all
around stock engine ever put into a aircooled van... if it were my bus I
would bite the bullet and get a good one put together. (well actually that
is what I did, and am very glad I did)

unfortunately you WILL need to pay more than $1000 for a good one.  avoid
the crate rebuilders especially gex
