from what i have read, since the oil didn't help the compression on #1, it

Rawls:
#1 thing you do before a compression test is set the valve lash. If the valves
are too tight, you'll have poor compression. Furthermore, if exhausts are too
tight they'll likely burn from not enough time or pressure to transfer the heat
to the seat.
#2 is disconnect the points to coil wire, the green one from the distributor to
the coil. This stops you from having spark.
#3 is block open the throttle blade. Compression is a little hard to get if
you've nothing to compress.
#4 make sure you have a good battery. Compression tests are quite dependent
upon battery condition.
#5 remote starter switch. Optional with a good helper, but need one or the
other.
#6 good compression guage. A screw-in one. I've never been able to make the
hold in ones work. (Well, I haven't tried in 30 years. That's how long I've had
the current guage.) You really want to watch the amount the guage goes up with
each compression stroke. It should make a big move 50-75 and half or so each
time till it reaches the max in about 4 strokes.
#7 Take out all the plugs before starting. And (this should be #1.5), it should
be warm. Warm will be bigger numbers and you'll feel better if nothing else.
Engines do most of their running while warm and this is the most logical
condition to test.
Cranking compression is a function of compression ratio, valve timing and
engine condition. With a low compression ratio like many type 1 engines are set
up with, your numbers might not ever be over 100, even if the engine is in
perfect health.
I think the formula for cranking compression is something like C= (Cr-1)x Pa
where Cr is the compression ratio and Pa would be pressure exerted by the
atmosphere (no overdriven positive displacement blowers here). So a 7.0/1
engine at sea level would only get 6x approx 15 psi at best, a little less than
90. (Physics teachers: am I figuring this right?)
(I do know that a 12/1 engine with a short duration cam I tested once made
about 225 lbs! Not a VW, a 427 Chevy.)
I'm at a loss to figure out why you have 2 kinds of plugs. Maybe someone's fix
for stripped threads? I'd just replace with what you took out. Soon enough,
you'll find out the rest of the story!
