Subject: Re: [T2] NADA on drugs!

What you pay for bussed is irrelevant,  the NADA is a replacement cost at
any given time. Did you read the description of the conditions? When my 70
deluxe was wrecked they low balled me at $1200. I had just over $4000 in the
bus not counting all of my time, It was a very solid bur with the only rust
in the front floors.It had dents and was 3 shades of red but it was complete
and solid as a rock. What should I have taken for it? The $1200 and lose
tons of money and be unable to replace it for that. You are Very lucky if
you can find a solid bus under $2000 running in North Carolina. All the ones
I looked at had lots of cancer. So in the situation I was in I needed al
least $2500 to get a similar bus. I wanted $3000 and settled for $2100 after
2 months of fighting.

True ,one can find good busses for cheap,I paid $400 for my 75 camper that
needs only paint and a canvas. What would it cost me to replace it tomorrow
if it was totaled today? What I paid is irrelevant, Its what it would cost
for another.

later- Bryan
