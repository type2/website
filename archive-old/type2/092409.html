Subject: Running Lights Right? Not!

My 1971 bus has no running lights or tail lights on the right. It also has 
no turn signals on the right. Left side seems to be working fine. When I 
turn on the emergency flashers, it blinks at the correct speed, but no 
lights on the right hand side. Left side looks fine.
Left turn signals seem to be working fine When I turn on the right turn 
signal I can hear the little flasher working, but it flashes really fast.

I'm not sure if the right side brake light is functioning. I'll find out 
tonight.

I'm stumped.

Anyone had this problem?
