Subject: combining 1.7L engine wiht 091 trans and '79FI... will it work?

Volks,

The short form:

I am planning to install a 1.7L egine in my '73 bus. Easy?  Stock?  Yes
and No...  I currently have a '78 2.0L, with FI,  and an 091 tranny in the
bus, and I want to keep using both the FI and tranny. Anyone know what
problems I am gonna face?

The long form:

To demonstrate the sad things that can happen to a bus over time, and to
let you know why it can be so hard to answer questions at a 20 year,
thousand mile remove, here's the story of my '73...

Back a bit I had this '78 which I loved.  I bought it with 40K on the
clock and drove it 100K miles or more.  When it, inevitabley, dropped the
#3 valve seat, I opted for a rebuild, and drove it another 10-20K.  Then I
drove it down to Florida one long night and into the back of a pickup the
next morning.  Killed it. Dead.  

But... I still had this low milage engine that I was anxious to retain, 

So... I went around to some local junk yard down there, found this
*rusty* '79 with a blown engine, and bought it.  Threw the '78 engine into
the bus and drove it north.  

At that point, I went shopping for a decent body.  Well, I found this nice
'73 that was in the process of being parted out, and I decided this was a
body I could work with.  Besides, it was a Westy!  So I bought it and
brought it home.  The guy wanted $1000, but was willing to drop to $500 if
he could take the engine (an oily 1600 DP with *no* bearer bar at the
rear and little tin {but some *REALLY FAB CHROME!}) and Transmission ( the
original 002, but almost certainly with some cracks in the hangers from
having had a 1600DP hung on it.  Well, I was willing to &quot;sacrifice&quot; these
beauties :-), so I brought it home sans engine and trans.  

I installed the '79 091 trans, the '78 block and the '79 FI in that '73
body, which served me well, going another 40K miles.  

This past spring, I got another drop in compression, so I decided to pop
some new heads on it.  That turned out to be a mistake :-(  The new heads
have never really worked out well, and adjusting the valves had been an
excersize in pure frustration.  Per my mechanic, the problem is that the
camshaft is worn, and needs to be replaced :-(((

Now recently, I have acquired a &quot;good used' 1.7L which I would like to put
in the '73.  Problem is...  the rear end of that beast is more '78 than
'73.  So.....

Questions:

Will I have problems getting the 091 to mate to the 1.7?
Should I use the 2L flywheel/clutch?
Should I look for a used 002? (or at least an 002 bell housing?)

What about the FI?  Will it work  (I can't think of why not, but...)
Should I start looking for a set of dual carbs/stacks/linkage? (this
engine has a dual webber on it right now)

What was the original smog stuff for this year?  do I need a smog pump?
(VA has gone to full visual on smog stuff back to '67 (Oh, you lucky
Californians!)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
