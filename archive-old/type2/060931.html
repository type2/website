Subject: RE: Pump Sinks in Campers Question 

[...]
 bought a dead ringer for my '70 Campmobile's original lever operated hand 
pump at Camping World (humongous RV place) a couple of years ago.  Fit 
perfectly, right down to the mounting flanges and holes.

Price:  $15.00

&gt;&gt; I have a '77 camper van which is clearly some sort of American conversion.  
Included in it is a water tank which delivers water to a pump type sink thingy 
(technical name is thing-a-ma-gigger).  The pump doesn't work anymore... &lt;&lt;
