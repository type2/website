Subject: Weber Progressive Vacuum Ports
Message-ID: &lt;374B3060.807D0B28_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;

        Found my Weber manual. Looking at all the pix for these models
(28/36, the various 32/32, and the 32/36), I see that each one shows a
vacuum port tube for the dizzy. They all seem to be very close to the
idle mixture screw. Most stick straight out, a couple go up at an angle.

        Since the port seems to be a integral part of the carb body
casting, I'd think that even if the tube was missing and the hole
plugged, it would be a simple matter to unplug the hole and insert a
tube.
