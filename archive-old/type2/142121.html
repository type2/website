Subject: Project for sale, must go

Hey Seth --
             I wish someone had told you about the rattle can stuff, 
considering you went to the work plus $$$ expense of dip-and-strip.  In my 
experience, automotive primers/paints do not adhere well (if at all) when 
applied over rattle can primer.  Rust-Oleum is bad news in that regard.  

It would help a lot if you would say what specific brand/product you used... 
was it always the same item, or did you buy whatever was on sale at the time?

If you decide to part-out the shell, I need a sliding door.  Thanx, Glenn

                    I have a 76 Westy that I was going to restore but since 
have lost the time and $$$ to finish the project. The bus is COMPLETELY 
STRIPPED. It was acid dipped in 2002 and I did alot of body work on it. There 
is a coat of rattle can primer on it except for the doors. Bus is  as solid as 
it gets. This bus SHELL is all there is so the project would be for someone 
with an existing Westy that has been contemplating a complete restoration, that 
can paint this bus and then swap all the remaining parts over.
