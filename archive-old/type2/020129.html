Subject: intake gasket and driving to s. america

does anyone know the part number for the gasket between the runners on
an fi bus and the head? Does anyone know where these are available?
Also has anyone driven down from the states to south america?  I have
been fantasizing about it and would like to do it someday.  I'm guessing
at least a months worth of driving.
thanks in advance
jamie
