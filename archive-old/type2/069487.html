Subject: Anyone heard of J-tubes to replace heaterboxes on 78?

I'm tired of paying 300 per side for heater boxes on my 78 Westy for minimal 
heat in return. I've got a gas heater anyway. Has anyone seen/heard/have/know
of a company that is selling or manufacturing J-tubes to replace the boxes?
I would LOVE to get my hands on such a pair of critters.
Thanks! 
Courtney
