Casey,

Speaking from recent experience, if you get mileage that bad, you are
dumping gas in there for whatever reason, and your plugs will foul, which
will cause you to stop, cuss and possibly resort to a Greyhound bus.

Fouled plugs would be the first thing to check, second thing is why is it
dumping all that gas (temp sender??? doesn't think that it is warmed up).
If you have fouled plugs and keep going that could possibly cause other
problems.

Might be cheaper than you think--heres hoping--
