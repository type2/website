&gt; Exhaust are at ends. That's the intake. If it has that
&gt; much play, the pushrod will be loose - it has a large
&gt; area to play in. Look at the end of the rocker arm
&gt; that pushes on the valve. There is an adjuster
&gt; there.Should be, anyway. Compare that one with the
&gt; other ones.&gt;


sorry, don't always take the time to bracket the quotes.  should the pusrod
be that loose.  wait, i guess you're saying if the valve adjuster is that
loose then the pushrod will be loose also and that is ok.  i looked at the
adjusters and the adjusting screws are all at different depths.  the
exhaust, the one on the end, adjusting screw was not as deeply sunk as the
others but had less play than the intake.


&lt;What year / engine are we working on?&gt;
75 FI ED auto solid lifters

&lt;Look in my 2nd album at the rocker arms. One has the
adjuster and one does not. Is this your situation?-BaH&gt;

not my situation.  both intake and exhaust have adjusters.  i,ve never
adjusted before, so learning will be fun.

thanks busahaulic.  acvws are slightly addictive.  btw the web page and
albums were quite helpful.
