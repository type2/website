&gt; Anyone else done anything similar?  It's going in the Award Winning=20
&gt; Burrito Express (70 Dormobile) and so with a pop top, cooling is an=20
&gt; issue.  Guess the Roadcow solution is out.  Anyone have luck with side =

&gt; mounted radiators?

I have seen a very neat setup with a large radiator (to cool a Leyland =
V8 in the back of the bus) mounted flat under the front floor (under =
your feet up the front) with a scoop just below the front bumper feeding =
above the radiator. Sorry I don't have any pictures that I can find. The =
fan was below the radiator sucking through the radiator and blowing =
down. It was very neatly done (could even pass as factory!). I have seen =
another variation (also cooling a Leyland V8) with the radiator under =
the middle of the bus, but they had overheating problems.
