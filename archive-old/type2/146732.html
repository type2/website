Subject: Need VW bus with sunroof for commercial shoot. 

Hello All-
I am putting on my hat as a Props guy for commercials and film work here.
Looking for a Bay Window or beetle with a sunroof for a commercial shoot 
in the Philly area. This would be a paid, one day rental, with the fee 
being somewhat negotiable.
If you are interested please call me by the end of day TODAY, JUNE 10TH 
as we are setting this up for shooting on June 15th (that's next 
Wednesday).
I need to have photos and specs to the Director by the end of day =-O
Nothing like short notice, eh?
The vehicle must run as it will be driven in shot.
Also please send an e-mail with:
 photos of the front, back, and sides of vehicle as well as a shot of 
sunroof
 Dimensions of sunroof
 Also state whether it is auto or standard

Lastly, the director wants to look at all sunroof and convertible 
options, so if you have (dare I say) a non-VW which is available for 
rental please feel free to send info and call.
They are not sure whether they want the vintage look or not, so all 
makes and models are a possibility, as long as they are a convertible or 
have a sunroof.

Thanks for your help
