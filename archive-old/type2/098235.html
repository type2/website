Subject: Gas Tank in Great Shape For Sale!!!

Hello List,

Is any one in the market for a good used non FI bus
gas tank??? I am switching over to FI in my 74 bus and
pulled my gas tank a couple days ago. I looked inside
of it expecting to see rust but I was surprised.
Almost no rust!!! Two low spots have  some surface
rust (Yes surface rust) and some old gasoline
deposites. This tank is in very good shape. I am
buying some POR 15 gas tank sealer which I plan to
seal my FI tank with and I will seal the two low spots
( the only spots with any rust at all) with the sealer
as well. The filter screen in it was not clogged and
had no rust build up in it either! This tank is in
very good shape. It comes with its screen which is in
good usable shape. It does't come with a fuel guage
sender. I am asking $50 OBO for it. I will also
consider a trade for a good heater blower with hoses
and the two hoses that run from the heater box flaps
to the body. This tank is a bargain compared to what
you would have to pay a junk yard for one especially
since you never know what you are going to get from
salvage yards and this one comes already sealed! This
one will be ready to go. Just pop in your existing
fuel gauge sender and install. 

If you are interested at all, please email me. I am
willing to ship it if necessary. Thanks!

Have a good day!
