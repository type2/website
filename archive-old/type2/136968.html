&gt;How is pedal effort compared to a stock '68-'70 with drum brakes?

The disc brakes require far more pressure to stop.

&gt;I
&gt;know that some of the euro busses came with disk brakes and no
&gt;booster.  I wonder if having the non-functional booster in the system
&gt;would greatly increase the effort required to stop the bus?  Anyone
&gt;out there with disk brakes and no booster care to comment?

Like I said, turn off the the engine and try to stop in a 71-79 bus. It's much harder.

&gt;I ask because I am in the process of upgrading my '69 to disk brakes,
&gt;and I am not planning to use the booster.  My feeling is that the bus
&gt;won't be any harder to stop than it is now, and I don't have a problem
&gt;with the level of effort now.

It will be harder. So much so that this will probably be an overall braking downgrade although just slightly above Flintstones.
