They were not turning off. After pulling the steering wheel (with 15/16
socket) I noticed a part of the wheel on the bottom that had protruded down
toward the column. This was situated on the left side of the steering
column. I also noticed that the spring for the signal switch was on the
opposite side. I re-mounted the steering wheel with the protrusion on the
right side (matching the location of the spring) and now my signal turns off
when finishing the turn!!
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
