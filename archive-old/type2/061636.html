Subject: Re: Fuel Filler Hose - Thanks

&gt;Thanks for all your assistance in the hose situation.  Just to share, I
&gt;purchased straight 57mm fuel hose (Gates).  It does bend, but not 
enough to
&gt;work in this bus, so off I went to Builders Square (like Home Depot or 
Lowes).
&gt;There I purchased a PVC bend with an outside diameter of practically 57 
mm.
&gt;Slipped in nicely to the hose.  I made the measurements, cut the hose, 
clamped
&gt;in the bend and, voila', a fuel filler hose for a '73 bus.  The PVC 
pipe is
&gt;the heavy duty stuff, not the standard you use with minor plumbing 
jobs.  It
&gt;is very sturdy with a highly gloss finish.  There was another acronym
&gt;following the PVC in the description but unfortunately I don't remember 
it
&gt;right now.  
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows any problems that I may face with this installation, 
please
&gt;reply.

Well Joe that is a good start but I have some consurnes about the PVC. 
I've made several Potato Cannons (another story) and we use ABS pipe for 
the job becaouse its very compatible with harsh chemicals(gas, 
either,MEK.laquor thinner) and the PVC is not, it melts. I would go back 
and buy the same elbow in ABS, the black stuff, and reassemble. You may 
get the PVC to work for a while, but it may melt away at a very bad time 
and all the melted PVC will clog up the filter.
One other option for you and everyone else with this problem is to go to 
an exhaust shop. I heard talk that the pipe is 2.25in ID. Muffler shops 
can custom bend a pipe that matches your rubber original and then all 
you would need is two very short peices of straight fuel resistance hose 
to connect the steel pipe that the muffler shop made to the tank on one 
end and the filler on the other. This way it will fit good , no bends in 
the rubber hose, and will never rot away. The straight rubber fuel 
resistance hose is easy to get, so it can be replaced every 2-3 years if 
you want to be safe.
I would opt for the steel (or even stainless steel) pipe, but the ABS 
will work. Just never use PVC. Good Luck
