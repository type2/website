Subject: Re: [T2] Re: (T2) Long Mirror

Uh.....So Many Roads.

&gt; &gt;&gt;i have been told that the rear end of the bus is sagging if the mirror
&gt; &gt;&gt;only shows the road directly behind you...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Which road would you like it to show ?
&gt; 
&gt; The Long and Winding Road?
&gt; The Road To Nowhere?
&gt; The Road Less Travelled?
&gt; The Yellow Brick Road?
