to whom it may concern at the busboys company,
i asked about lowering my bus on the list a couple months ago, and
someone from your company e-mailed me and told me that they could help me on 
lowering the front suspension on my 72 westy. they gave me a phone number 
but i must have lost it. so if it's no problem i would like it if i could 
get some info. thanks.
kenny
