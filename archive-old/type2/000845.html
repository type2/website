Subject: repairing my dissolving cabinets
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 2000 12:03:28 +0100

After extreme wet weather last week, I had a pool of water which had leaked
in via the sliding door seal. It ran onto the top of the wardrobe cabinet
and onto the floor and soaked into the chipboard, and the bottom 2 inches of
the cabinet and the top panel have swollen and the laminate is lifting. This
is a 79 Devon.

I can replace the top with a spare piece of board, but the bottom part needs
cutting off and something suitable splicing in. I don't want to just replace
rotten chipboard with something that will go the same way, so is there an
alternative like for example the UPVC that they make windows out of, that
comes in 3/4 inch thick planks that can be sawn and is impervious to water.
Ideally it would be brown or yellow. How about marine ply - is this any good
for this sort of thing? Any kitchen engineers here who can advise?
