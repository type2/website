&gt;I broke a cv joint trying to separate it from the driveshaft. The ball hub

&gt;Should I find someone to press this off?

Buy a 12 ton hydraulic press from Harbor Freight--they're very reasonably
priced.  They do a great job on wheel bearings as well.  While you're there,
get their 3/4&quot; drive metric large socket wrench set--they make great
mandrels for pressing things out/in with the press, and you'll have
the large sockets for those few occasions when you will need one.
Their 2 1/4 ton garage jack is just the ticket for dropping 
engines...............
You could probably blow your whole roll, without trying too hard--
and you'd probably be better off for it.
