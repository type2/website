Subject: '73 or '72 to '71 rear brake conversion

Anyone know what it would take to put the rear brakes off of a '73 or '72 and
put them onto a '71?  I have a sinking feeling about Funky's('71) right side.
I hope to take a look at it soon, but worse case, I can pull the rears off
either a '73 or a '72 that are sitting around.  Anyone know how deep I'd have
to go?  Thanks in advance!

Have a good one,
Eric
