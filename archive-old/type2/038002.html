Subject: grassroots in july, upstate ny

happy friday,
i figured id post this friday seeing its bus related
and it isnt.   i from upstate ny originally and we
have a music festival in my hometown every
year(grassroots)   its a great time, good music, etc.,
and to make this bus related i was wondering if anyone
was planning on going in their bus and camping there. 
 i know at least one or two of you are planning to
attend so i thought it might be fun to have a type 2
list camp spot where all our busses could gather.   im
going and have my camping tickets already, so if youre
planning on going, drop me a line pmail.    ill leave
a link to the festival below if youre interested.
enjoy your weekend all:)
