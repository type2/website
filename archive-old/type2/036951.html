Subject: Re: Brake replacement shopping list - opinions?

&gt; Hi all!
&gt;
&gt; I want to have some faith in my braking system, and I figured the best
&gt; way to do that was to replace everything in it. So, I headed over to
&gt; busdepot_dot_com and started putting together a shopping list. Would someone
&gt; be able to take a look at this and give me some feedback? It's for a
&gt; 1970 station wagon.
&gt;
Chris,
Just did it on my '70.I didn't replace the hoses other than the ones
directly feeding the wheel cylinders but maybe I should have.  Look at the
drums closely.  On mine the rears were gouged, pretty far gone and I
replaced them.  Fronts were OK.  For what it's worth, Muir recommends
against resurfacing VW drums and I believe him.  Watch out for the Master
cylinder.  The part change from the 68-69 unit ($149), to the one listed for
'70 happened during production.  I lost and paid.  Count the number of stop
light switches.  If you have one the '70 MC is OK.  Two means you need the
earlier part.  Or copy the complete part number.
Good luck.
