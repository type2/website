Subject: I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

------=_NextPart_000_0030_01C222A8.F353CA00
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

This is something I've noticed over the years, but have never been able =
to diagnose or fix (maybe there IS no fix):

When I'm driving my '79 bus with fool injection over high mountain =
passes, I sometimes smell gasoline fumes near the top of the pass. Once =
I'm over the top of the pass, the odor goes away until I'm near the top =
of another high mountain pass. This happens only on huge passes like =
Monarch Pass (11,312 feet) in Colorado, which climbs over the Great =
Divide.

Everything on the bus is pretty much stock, and I had the air flow meter =
adjusted, after the engine rebuild, by a knowledgeable specialist who =
used a big expensive exhaust gas analyzer. The smell sometimes still =
occurs near the top of the pass.

Could it have someting to do with the fuel vapor canister, which is =
hooked up, but has never been replaced?

It's not a major problem; the bus still runs fine. I just wonder if =
anyone else has experienced this.

R.D.
'79 Bus
