Hi All,

My friends and I are doing a complete resto on a '75 Station Wagon.  Later in its
life somebody put in a Westy package with folding seat, etc.

While under the bus we found a canister, has 2 wires going to a sensor on the
top, and two heavy duty looking hoses coming out of it.  Hoses look like some
type of A/C hose.  It's about 5&quot; in diameter, about 5&quot; tall, mounted on the
driver's side slightly behind the driver's door, on the outside of the frame
rail.  All the hoses have been cut, all the wires have been cut.

The bus has been converted from FI to a Progressive Weber.

Anybody got a clue?  Charcoal filter?  Fuel pump?  Fuel Accumulator?  Remote
Bong?

TIA,
Robert
R&amp;D&amp;W&amp;A&amp;K&amp;S

'75 Bus, Daisy
