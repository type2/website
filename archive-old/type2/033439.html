Eine Freulische Freitag to y'all..

Anyone ever done, or seen done, a bus motor swap to a M*zda rotary?  Evidently
Kennedy eng. has the kit .. was curious as to the degree of difficulty. 
Reminds me of an oooooold M*zda ad:  Piston engine goes boing-boing-boing ..
M*zda engine goes hmmmmmmmmmm...... hey, it IS Friday  ;)

Also: Have received, from www.cbperformance_dot_com, a multiple adapter for oil
press/temp senders to bolt on vs. violating oil sump plate  :)
