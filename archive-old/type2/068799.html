Subject: Re: bus security (paranoids exposed)

I happen to keep my '77 westy very neat and clean and it is certainly no
show car but I have to say that when I read the post by Emily Jo (I think that
was who it was, I apologize if I am wrong) about keeping the bus trashed to
deter theft, I could tell right away that she was joking.  It did not seem at
all like a serious post.  I also think she posted something about using the 
bus for storage at college and I can relate to that also.  While my apartment
gives me plenty of storage space, the PO of my bus (a fellow student at my
college) was storing an entire bedroom set in my/her bus.

Besides, If you put my bus next to a bunch of trashed ones, mine may look
like the best of the bunch!!  (Actually it still might lose, but I love it 
anyway).
