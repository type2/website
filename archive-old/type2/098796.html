Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded - Bad Starter? HELP!

&gt; Symptoms: Key in, turn to Start, no sound.  Voltage is at 12v, idiot lights 
&gt; go on, but nothing - not even a click - from the starter.  I bridged across 
&gt; the starter terminals, and the starter runs (whizzzz!), but it doesn't 
&gt; engage the flywheel.  I heated the starter and solenoid with a torch to 
&gt; un-freeze anything that might be frozen, but still had the same results - 
&gt; no luck.

What is the condition of the battery? New one? Cold weather (or rather
all the extra stuff we run when cold) can help kill a marginal batter.
Do you have the same results with the battery hooked up with jumper
cables to a running vehicle? Give these a try first. The cold weather
may have just accented a bad battery for you.
 
&gt; Questions: Is the solenoid bad?  Is the starter bad?  Is the wiring bad?  
&gt; Should the starter engage and start the engine if I bridge across the 
&gt; starter terminals?  Is there anybody in the greater Boston area that has a 
&gt; good starter for cheap?  Can I replace the starter with the engine and 
&gt; trans in the car?

Yes you can remove it with all that in the bus. 2 bolts &amp; a few
electrical connections to remove, then replace.
