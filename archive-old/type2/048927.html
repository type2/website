Subject: [T2] Needed: Champaign Fabric for '78 Westfalia

If anyone out there can help me with my search, I would be very grateful.

I have a '78 Westfalia Deluxe (Champaign Edition) and I've been looking for
the original brown plaid fabric to reupholster the front seats so as to keep
them original and matching the back seat/beds.  Does anyone have an idea as
to where I can get the fabric with the factory pattern, or possibly the
upper cushion/bed from a parted-out bus?

Thanks in advance for whatever help you can send my way.

I'm relatively new to this whole VW thing and I've been very impressed with
the comradery of this list's members.  I'm glad I found you all.  Are there
other lists that some of you would recommend I join?

David

PS  I'm also looking for a small table that attached to the dash and is
supported by one leg.  I have no idea what it's officially called.
