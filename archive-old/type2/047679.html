Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

Beth sends:

&gt; Hello listees, I am trying to replace my rear brake shoes and so far am
&gt; getting nowhwere.  I cannot even losen my lug nuts!  I have sprayed WD40
&gt; on them and this stuff called PB blaster and so far nothing is working.
&gt; I am not a weak woman by any means but I am REALLY trying to loosen
&gt; these damn things and getting very frustrated.  Is there some trick I am
&gt; missing?  The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
&gt; special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
&gt; springs off. Is this true?  Thanks in advance for any help.  Beth and
&gt; &quot;Prudence&quot; the '78 bus in NJ.

Volkswagens don't have lug nuts. They have lug bolts, or more specifically
lug bolts that weld themselves to the brake drums.

How do you get them off? First, have some coffee. ;) Then get a 1/2&quot; drive
breaker bar, a 19mm socket and a hunk of pipe about four feet long. I use an
Advance Auto Parts Special Thorsen-brand breaker bar; a 1/2&quot; black iron pipe
fits it fine--this is the cheapest metal pipe at Home Depot. Put the socket
on the breaker bar, the breaker bar in the pipe, put the socket on a lug
bolt, and stand on the distant end of the pipe. Torque is the result of
force and distance, so if you weigh 125 and stand four feet from the lug
bolt, you're putting 500 lb-ft against that fastener, which is a lot. (If
you don't weigh 125, you have to do your own math.) If it still won't turn,
bounce up and down on it a couple of times. I have seen lug bolts that won't
yield to an air wrench give up in the face of the Breaker Bar and Pipe.

Make sure you grab onto something while bouncing. Suitable candidates are
the gutter on your bus and someone else. Falling down and squishing your
face while attempting to remove lug bolts is no fun at all.

The &quot;special spring removal tool&quot; is a very complex device. You go to Home
Depot and buy the biggest set of vise-grips they have--no more than a foot
long, though. Then take a magic marker and write &quot;special spring removal
tool&quot; on the side of them. The real problem is the spring-loaded retainer
that holds the shoe on. It looks like a washer with a nail (with the pointy
end beaten out flat) sticking through it, and a spring pushing the washer
away from the brake shoe. What you have to do to get this off is to push in
on the washer, turn it 90 degrees and let it come off, while holding the
head of the nail against the brake backing plate. The little tool makes this
easier, but most people hold the head of the nail with one hand and push-
and-turn on the washer with the other.
