Subject: Fwd:  Wheel Bolt Patterns - Question...
Message-ID: &lt;7ukkj1$4j7v_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi, 

&gt; Without re-opening debates on offsets, load capabilities, and all
that 
&gt; stuff, I have a question.

 Like _that's_ possible...

&gt; Which cars and trucks and vans share the same wheel bolt patterns
with the 
&gt; later model Baywindow busses?

 Mercedes, some Fords, some big Audi/VWs (200, VR6 Passat), Vauxhall
Carlton?

&gt; Last question - any of you ever had your rotors and drums re-studded?
What 
&gt; was your cost? (And no I think I'll skip bolt on adaptors - scary!!)

 Brian Verbeek has a post on this in the archives, 
I'm sure I saw another one by a longstanding listee describing his
pain and hassle trying to get 12mm studs installed but I can't find
it now (many Mercs seem to use 12mm bolts where VW used 14mm studs).

&gt; My plan is that I have a set of OEM Porsche cookie cutter wheels and
plan 
&gt; to use them on my bus. Have checked the basic fit and they should do
nicely.

 Most Porsches use a 130mm pcd. Brian's suggestion to use a good quality
spacer to correct the offset and simultaneously match the fasteners
seems as good as can be achieved to me, since correcting the mountings
without addressing the offset will cause problems.

&gt; Besides their good looks, these wheels will call for using a tire
with a 
&gt; shorter sidewall, and this should help the Bay's wandering on the
highway 
&gt; on windy days. 205/60-15 is almost exactly the same diameter as
185/70-14. 
&gt; I'll probably be running 205/65-15 tires though to fill the
fenderwells a 
&gt; slight bit more, and get a slight amount of overdrive too. Something
like 5 
&gt; mph for a given RPM.

 I'm thinking to stay with stock radius at the front (speedo accuracy)
and maybe going oversize at the rear if I ever get a 911 mill in.

 I worked out 205/65R15 as correct 205/60 and 215/60 a little small and
215/65 a tad tall. 195/70 is correct and (in Europe) available much more
cheaply. I _think_ that a 195/70 with a stiff sidewall (99 or 100 index)
will be better than a 205/65 with lower index.

&gt; Figure alot of people will have alot to say about this as any
discussion 
&gt; about tires and wheels seems to really work like a powder keg. I
don't want 
&gt; to tie up alot of bandwidth so let's skip the tire and wheel 
&gt; offset/strength debates. There's plenty of that in the archives.

 Yeah, but not enough on selection/mounting and generally making it
work!!!  :-)

Cheers,
	W.
