Subject: Re: [T2] 009 not good for my bus?

I want to clarify a couple things.

1) a retarded #3 does NOT make the cylinder run cooler. #3 is retarded
because #3 runs hotter (big difference). With a higher temperature,
combustion is faster, so it doesn't need as much timing to get the push at
the right time, compared with the other cylinders.

2) 009s haven't had a retarded #3 for over 20 years, so don't think you are
doing your engine a favor by having a 009, especially since it's likely
fairly new (with no #3 retard). If you don't believe me, put a timing light
on #1 then move to #3 and see if the timing is the same.

3) having the retarded #3 only helps if the distributor body and drive
pinion is actually indexed properly. When I ran a VW garage, most 009
&quot;installations&quot; that I came across were incorrect. Though it will run in
&quot;any&quot; orientation, only 1 is right (oiling holes).

4) since 009s are timed at full advance, which is a &quot;worst case&quot; scenario
since it's centrifugal only, it's actually 12-15 degrees TOO RETARDED for
highway driving. This causes a loss of 4mpg and 15-20 degree engine temp
increase compared with the proper timing, which only a vac advance can give
you. Vac advance is a load sensing devise, and timing requirements are VERY
different for light load and heavy loads; since the 009/050 is only RPM
sensing, and can't sense the load of the vehicle, you have to time to &quot;worse
case&quot; which is full load.

The 009 does work, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, or that the
magazines would lead you to believe. The recent quality control is also a
joke.
