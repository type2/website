&gt; That is great input, thanks. It sounds like it is decently sized. It is hard
&gt; to tell from the BD website how big it really is. Do you have any pics of it
&gt; attached to your bus?

sure, here are a few

&gt; What is the tent channel on split buses? I have a bay, so I guess I don't have
&gt; this. Is this going to make a major difference with the way it seals to the
&gt; bus? I would like to have a good seal around the bus for sure.

It's a piece of aluminum with a &quot;c&quot; on the end. Part of the tent is
inserted in the C that has a cord inside and holds it tight. I really
don't have any good pictures of it, but it is bolted right to the
body. Works great!
 
&gt; I have been wondering a little about the flat ceiling part of the tent that
&gt; connects to the bus. Like you said, it looks like water would pool there.

it does, but not a real big deal. just something I noticed.
 
&gt; The part of the tent that connects to the bus, does it come up to the bottom
&gt; of the sliding door or is it just open to the underneath of the bus? I have a
&gt; little one that will immediately crawl under the bus if give the chance :)

just open.
