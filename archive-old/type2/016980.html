&gt; Hi,Im new to type 2's but I am very dedicated to VWs.I have recently purchased
&gt; a a 74 automatic. It sat in a barn for a couple of years an the carbs are all
&gt; gummed up. I dont know that I am experienced enough to rebuild them myself so
&gt; I called the neighborhood VW shop and they told me that they would'nt touch
&gt; them because there are bushings in the throttle body that will need to be
&gt; replaced and they cant do that there. They also said that you cant purchase
&gt; new carbsfor this model. I do know a little about cars and I am mechanicly
&gt; inclined is there a book that I can purchase to walk me through a rebuild.What
&gt; other options do I have.Keep in mind that I am a student with very little
&gt; money to throw around.I was also own a 83 Rabbit GTI. I have herd of people
&gt; putting 1.8L ford motors in their busses. Is it possible to put my rabbit
&gt; motor in the bus. If so where can I get a conversion.   Thank you, Corey Harris
Corey: 
What makes you think that there is anything wrong with the carbs?
Just because they are gunky on the outside doesn't mean the are on the
inside. Have you had it running? If not, I'd flush out the tank and
leave the carbs alone.
In my opinion most shops are totally clueless about how to fix a carb.
They are right in a sense that throttle shafts wear and new carbs fix
that (rather expensively). First determine how loose are the carb
shafts.With the lever just above idle stop try to move the shaft
perpendicular to the shaft. Try moving in a circular motion to try the
limits of the wear in several different directions. There should be a
very slight movement even if it's not worn, but if it's bad you sould be
able to see it easily.
There are many shops around the country that re-bush carbs and if yours
need it write back telling us what town or region you're in.
I'd say it's about 100 times easier to fix your carbs than to put in a 
water-cooled engine.
