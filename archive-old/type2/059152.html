Subject: Leaky 81 auto trans resolved
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I had pulled the engine on the 81 to replace the torque converter seal and
while it was out I replaced the rings as well. Everything else looked good.
When I replaced the engine and fired it up however, the trans leaked from the
seal as though I hadn't done a thing. Concluding that I had no idea what to do
even if I pulled it again, I set out to find a shop to do the job.

You would have thought that I was asking about some kryptonite powered device.
One guy literally laughed at me and another mumbled about excess pump pressure
and all were quick to wave me off. Finally I took it to a shop that
specialized in vw/audi and had been around for a while. They had it for a week
during which they pulled the trans, redid the seal and found it to leak
exactly as it had for me. They pulled it again and focused on the torque
converter this time. It worked fine but in fact the flange around which the
seal fits was pitted and thus causing the leak. Who knows how something in
such an oily environment could rust but it was obvious on inspection. They
charged me $100 for a used converter plus the labor of course.

I had to leave for the weekend but it didn't leave a drop in the drive after
bringing it home on friday. This week I'll see if my luck holds, get a
replacement thermostat, record my new compression numbers, and switch back to
synthetic oil after a 100 miles or so.
