The 2.0L hyd GEX that came with my current bus lasted almost 50K between me
and the PO. Dropped #3 seat badly (head wasn't &quot;coreworthy&quot;) among other
head problems. Also had been assembled with a damaged piston. The bottom
end was tight enoguh so it just needed new bearings. YMMV

Take it easy and enjoy the ride. The engine will last longer.
