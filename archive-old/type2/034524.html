Subject: cylinder head size

Just a quick inquiry about the difference of head
sizes.  i purchased what i thought was a 1800 cc head
for my bus from an individual on the type 2
classifieds and when i received it it was not the same
as my head which i know is an 1800.  it was exactly
the same size as an old 1700 head i have kickin
around.  when i contacted the seller he stated to me
that there is a difference with the heads if it is a
carburated or fuel injected motor for the 1800.  this
sounds a bit phishy to me, so am i just naive or is
there this guy pullin one over on me.
thanks for the input
