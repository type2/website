Subject: update a little help needed! CV/axle replacement ?'S

They don't have inches in Germany!


&quot;doh!&quot;

ok, I didn't actually have a 6mm, but my roommate gave me my late xmas 
present after i told him what i was working on and wouldnt you know, it was 
a tool kit and had one in it.

sweet, but on to the next part...

needless to say, im in a little over my head, not in terms of how do I get 
these hex nuts off or which order to do them in, but on the one most easily 
accessable to me where it meets the tranny ive cleaned them up, soaked in 
liquid wrench, tapped a bit to try and loosen em up a little, yet can't seem 
to get it to even move a tiny hair...

im thinking to myself, what happens when I get to those top nuts where you 
have little to no room to even get your hands in there, how in whomevers 
name am I to turn those, when those that are so easily navigated around I 
cannot budge....  im a big guy, and can usually muscle whatever I need to 
when the need arises, but sheesh! any tips in this department?

that little hex tool is the right fit, but I am having a heck of a time 
gettin er to turn....

would how I have the bus jacked up off of the ground have any bearing on 
this? If i jack it up too high or not high enough, would that in any way put 
more or less pressure on these nuts, making it any easier or harder?

currently I just have it up enough to crawl under, so while the tire is 
lifted a little, it still makes contact with the ground....

I really would like to take care of this myself, but if push came to shove I 
guess I could take it elsewhere.. id just hate to quit at this stage..


Thanks again for any tips, tricks, etc....
