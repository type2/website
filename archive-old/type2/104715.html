Subject: Re: [T2] side marker lens

From: &quot;bpierce&quot; &lt;bpierce_at_shaka_dot_com&gt;
&gt; The lens that lasted just 18 months were from the Bus Depot.  BUT IT'S
&gt; NOT THEIR FAULT - did I say that loud enough for everyone?  They sell
&gt; what they got.  Let me know if yours fade - if you ever get around to
&gt; putting them on that is....

My apologies to Ron and company at Bus Depot.

When I wrote &quot;... if those were repro lenses, you may have been ripped off.
Quality repro lenses should not turn white or get brittle.&quot;, I meant that
the manufacturer may be responsible, not necessarily the retailer.

I tend to respond as a manufacturer as well as a direct retailer, and I
sometimes forget that repros are also sold through retailers who get their
stock from another party.

While some retailers might pass along a bad product, from what I've read
here, Bus Depot does not.

Kudos, Ron.  Sorry for any offense.
