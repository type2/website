re. hammer &amp; chisel: This technique works four times out of five. Jam up the 
wheel so it doesn't turn. 

If this won't work, you can grind or drill the head off. The remaining stud 
will come out easily with easy-outs or vice grips once the shaft is out of 
the way, since taking the head off the bolt releases all the metal elasticity 
that's making the bolt tight in the first place.

A left hand drill and easy out set is a nice thing to have lying around.

&quot;Don't force it -- get a bigger hammer.&quot;
