Subject: ADMIN: Viruses, please read and do not reply. =^ )


There have been a great many viruses sent to a great many list members 
over the past few days; this has excited some commentary on the type2 
list at least (I haven't read the vintagebus list yet). All reports of 
these with which I am familiar originate from the same place, and will 
show the IP address 24.216.0.149 as the origin if the headers are 
examined carefully.

Please do NOT do the following if you are not sure you received a virus 
from 24.216.0.149 (the klez worm is everywhere, if somebody sent you a 
virus it did not necessarily come from this source, if you don't know 
how to interpret email headers then please sit on your hands).

Several of us have complained to the ISP responsible, to no avail. If 
you have a virus sent you, and careful examination reveals that the 
origin was 24.216.0.149, here is the contact information for the ISP 
responsible, High Speed Access of Louisville, Kentucky USA. I have 
already complained by email and by phone, email was ignored, and the 
second phone operator &quot;Shawn&quot; admitted to me that &quot;we don't really have 
an abuse department per se&quot; but promised to &quot;get ahold of somebody 
downstairs&quot;. The first operator had put me on hold, then eventually the 
line went dead.
