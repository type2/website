Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Short range FM transmitters

If you went AM, you'd have more chance of trampling someone as AM 
signals travelers farther than FM (FM is line of site, AM bounces).  I 
believe there's a station broadcast from Mexico that can reach Canada if 
the weather's just right.  FM also sounds better than AM.

If you were going to go to a bus campout, I'd go for FM because chances 
are that you are out in a remote area and you probably won't get many FM 
stations out there.  Pick a free frequency and broadcast away..

&gt; These sound like the ideal thing to have at a bus event. Let people listen to
&gt; what you want to broadcast if they want to in their own bus. Might be a useful
&gt; tool. I was looking at the same kit yesterday, but was wondering what the
&gt; difference would be if you got an AM one? I figured that the AM stations might
&gt; have less chance of trampling on someone else's signal. Is their any real
&gt; difference in the sound quality between AM and FM when used in such a small
&gt; area?
