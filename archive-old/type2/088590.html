Subject: Re: [T2] dashboard lights

If all are out, you more than likely have lost the rheostat on the headlight
switch. Unscrew the headlight switch knob, unscew the escutheon. Pull the
switch out from behind. Don't disconnect any wires! You will see part of a
round black piece sticking out of the aluminum case. Look in the groove of it.
Do you see a coil of silver wire? Or is it empty and pieces of the wire are
falling out? If it is the latter, you need a new switch. If you screw the knob
back on, you can turn it back and forth and see what it does to dim the dash
lights. The terminal at the end by the knob should be 58b, this is the dash
lights. Until you get a new switch, you can piggyback it to 58 and the
dashlights will come on bright whenever you turn the lights on.

&gt; Just another quick question. I have a 72 westy and I need to know how to get
&gt; the lights on my dash to work. You know the lights that illuminate the
&gt; speedometer and stuff. If anyone knows i would appriciate it. Thanks
