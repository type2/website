Subject: 914 decision  :)

I appreciate all the wisdom Ive gained. If it wasnt for the list I wouldve
been lost and taken for quite a bit of money just due to plain ignorance. I
had a helluva lot more options then I thought! Im going to pursue this
course of action.
Take blue to HELMUT AND VITOS who didnt even know it was a porche engine
upon first look and have them pull it.
Since my German friend :) lives across the street Ill just rum it across to
him and have him rebuild it (hopefully with me present!!!!)
After the rebuild Ill run it back across the street to have it re-installed
( reminds me of that Seinfield WIth George running across the street with
the giant Frogger arcade game!!! )

 I only have a few more questions so I could be more educated on whats going
to happen here
 .1) What kind of heat exchangers would fit the 914( there are ones on there
now but not in very good shape cant tell if they are orig or not?)
2) What kind of exhaust system would fit that bolt config? right now there
is a LOUD type 1 exhaust on there. I cant tell if there are three or four
bolts to see what type of 914 it is.

When I checked the ARCHIVES all I read was that the stock Exchangers wont
fit and niether would the exhaust although No alternatives were ever
pondered.
Thanks all. ALMOST THERE!!! Im one step closer ( actually hundreds of steps
closer!) To meeting all of you at next years camp outs and all around BUS
doings!!!!
