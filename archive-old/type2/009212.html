Laurin,

&gt;Well, the $500 worth of parts I ordered last week was supposed to get to me
&gt;2 days ago-I offered to pay extra for quick delivery and was told UPS was
&gt;nearly as fast and much cheaper. So I call today and find nothing was
&gt;shipped!  They are waiting on a couple parts to come in.

This is an FRT (frequently recurring thread). In this case, there is not 
quite enough information to go on. So perhaps you could fill in some details.

1) Did you make it clear to the order taker that time was of the essence? 
That is, did he or she have (in advance) the same sense of urgency that 
you have made clear to us on the list?

2) While speaking to Ron, did you let him know that you are a list member?

3) Why did you choose to order via telephone rather than using the web 
page ordering process?

In some consumers' ideal world these questions wouldn't be important. But
my sense is that Ron is trying to do something different from RMMW and
Wolfsburg West. One of those things is to offer substantially lower
prices.  You say that price is not important to you -- but it sure is
important to me (because, when all is done, I suspect I will have replaced
every darned part in Peregrine -- but that's another thread). 

Now, my experience with Bus Depot has been absolutely first-rate. But 
that's just anecdotal. I do not doubt that you are disappointed with the 
service. So my questions reflect a sense that you may not have been clear 
about when you needed the parts, and the consequences of late shipping.

If you did make all that clear, perhaps we on the list can encourage Ron 
to forego a sale when there is doubt about whether deadlines can be met.
