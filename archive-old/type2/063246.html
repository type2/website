Re servicing Ebersbacher heaters:

For info on parts, try Ark Mirvis,  at AUTO HEATER TECHNOLOGIES, 31 Byram
Bay Rd, Hopatcong , NJ., ph 201-298-6363- he's an Ebersbacher trained
mechanic (learned right in Germany) and I see him scouring the shows for
old heaters.  As I recall, he's reluctant to sell parts  (personally told
me he feels that they are too dangerous for average person to fool with,
and doesn't want to feel responsible if it blows up), but will fix your
heater, and will gladly talk to you over the phone about your heater, or
try to sell you one (swore by Stewart Warner, but I think they stopped
making them). I know he likes the BN4's better.   ...
