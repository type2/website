Subject: fallowup: tapping noise in newly rebuilt engine

   Hello,
 The tapping noise in my newly rebuilt engine turned out to be a hydraulic
valve that was too loose. It turned out to be the exhaust valve in the #3
cylinder. I tightened it and the noise went away.
  New question though.....  I had to turn the valve adjust screw much
farther than the other screws.  This is an AVP engine. They use remachined
hydraulic valve lifters. I'm thinking maybe this valve lifter is not pumping
up properly.I found that there was a very small range of adjustment on the
valve screw between very bad running and valve lash. From reading the
archives I get the impression  that there is a range of from two turns to a
half turn beyond first touching of the screw. I only had about a quarter
turn range where it would   run OK without noise.
     I happen to have some new valve lifters. Might I be better off just
installing a new lifter in this cylinder?
Thanks,
Neil Sundberg
