Subject: Gas heater install ...help (long)

I am in the process of installing my BN4 gas heater ductwork and have run
into a minor problem. Does anybody have better pictures of this install than
the scans of the manual on the T2 site? I printed off this manual, but I
cannot make out the pictures. 

I cut the hole in the sheet metal on the interior side and have the firewall
off on the motor side. I have the ductwork going through the interior side
and attached by its small mounting bracket. I was test fitting the other
piece of duct worked on the motor side, the piece the contains the flap to
control temp. I found that it will only go in beside the tank as far as the
thermostat, about 3 inches short of attaching to the other ductwork. Once it
gets this far it starts to hit the top of the opening. The bottom of the
ductwork hits the seam in the gas tank. Does anybody have pics of this part
of the install? Do I need to try to move the gas tank over a little to gain
extra clearance or do I have the wrong piece of ductwork? I am going to try
to take pics tonight, but I would like to make some more headway on this
tonight if anybody has any experience with this.

I did notice that this piece of ductwork has what appears to be part of the
firewall made into it, but this shape does not match exactly the firewall
that I have in my 73 westy. The opening around the gas tank of a 73 goes
straight across, then goes at an angle for about 4 inches then goes straight
down to the bottom. If it did not have this angle part, I would not be
having any problems.

I am also looking for any pics on the mounting of the heater itself. I have
one mounting bracket that came with it. I have no pipes for it yet, will
need to fabricate them later once it is mounted.

Thanks for any help,
Corbett
