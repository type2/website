Lee,

It was Barry Burneskis and I who went.  The pictures were taken by Barry.

Updating the status of the transaction, I have the money from you.  The
title is with the bus here in Virginia at Victor's friend's place along
with the bus.  I will be going out to exchange the money for the title
tomorrow night.  At that point all that remains is to get the bus up to
Baltimore and onto the ship.  Because of work, that will probably happen
on 09/02 (here) or 02/09 (there).  In the mean time I need to research
towing, shipping documents, and any U.S. Customs forms that are required.
I also need to look the bus over with an eye to removing any protruding
items (mirrors, mostly).

If anyone does take Lee up on the offer to include parts in the shipping
of the bus, let me know and I will make arrangements to get them into the
bus.
