Michael Dean (vwkombi_at_dmv_dot_com) has been removed from the list.

Quoting from the charter:

&quot;PRIORITY ONE RULES -- If you screw up here you'll be kicked off the list
and quite possibly banned forever (we really mean it):

--Do not EVER post virus warnings, or messages about important issues
that you think should concern everybody in the world. Do not post
messages unless they have legitimate bus content. If you think the
message you're sending is so important that the &quot;bus content&quot; rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it.&quot;

&gt;Just got a message from the list with the Snow White virus, just a warning

&gt;want to make sure they aren't affected, that's how it spreads, you wouldn't
&gt;even know you sent it....
