Subject: Re: [T2] Difference between 1971 vs. 1968 Engines

Karl has a very good point with the suggestion of an allen bolt to solve the
problem,,, another way around the problem is to use a larger nut under the head
of the new bolt to lift the bolt away from the notch in the transmission. you
need a bolt long enough to compensate for the added nut under the head. or a few
washers....

in other words....
Slide a 12mm nut or a couple 10mm washers over the 10mm bolt, then insert it
into the trans and tighten into the engine threaded boss. This keeps the head of
the bolt from locking on the notch on the trans

I use a swivel and a really long extension so the air wrench is actually in
front of the nose of the trans.. follow the clutch cable to the bolt head.

There is another way,, that is to pop the threaded insert out of the engine, and
use the nut and bolt from the 68 .... problem being,, as George said,, it is a
bear to get a wrench on in front of the offset oil cooler.

If you have found things done like this... &lt;sheepish grin&gt; it was probably the
result of the previous owner!  LOL

&gt;  Just to be clear, that bolt still is inserted from front to back, and it
&gt;  screws into this flange.  I'm off to the hardware store this morning to
&gt;  pick up a new bolt.

&gt; A word of advice:  Get a Allen headed bolt!
&gt;
&gt; The original 68 bolt was a D bolt with the nut on the engine side. The trans
has casting to allow the
&gt; head of the D bolt to lock in place.
