Subject: Re: [T2] starter problem?

A couple of good, square whacks to the solenoid with a hammer sometimes
helps, too.    In 1980 I drove a 6v 1961 Bug with a barely working solenoid.
Kept it working for weeks after each whack.  Then I got myself a '74 and
lived happily ever after in decadent luxury!  (Well, at least until rust
claimed it a few years later...)

BaH covered it pretty well.

The very first thing to do since it's so easy is use a screwdriver or remote
starter switch. On my last drive from CO to CA if we stopped for lunch or
dinner the heatsoak would get to things. A &quot;maybe&quot; click and that's it. I
would grab the screwdriver and dive under the bus (after making sure it's in
neutral... 3 times!) and it would fire right up. Interesting thing is that
the Guac's never done it since. Even driving across the Mojave desert in
120* heat for the CA trip I'm on now.
