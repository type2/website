Subject: Timing notch on 73 1700
Message-ID: &lt;376ea4e5Timing notch on 73 1700*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;would a rebuild include installation of a pulley that has no markings?  If  
so, how do I mark TDC on the pully wheel?  (figure I
&gt;could find TDC by seeing  where the #1 piston stops moving up by putting 
something in the spark plug  hole).  With the fan
&gt;arrangement that is on a 1700,  I find it difficult to  see the case half 
lines.  am I going to have to pull the heads and watch
&gt;#1  piston, and make a precise guess at where the mark should be?

Per Muir and Wilson you can determine TDC for #1 by removing the valve 
covers, turning the alternator pulley with an 
adjustable wrench while craning your neck under the bumper or by moving a 
piece of the engine seal with your finger and
establish a line of sight across the tappet screws on the #3 valves. Now 
simply turn with crescent wrench until you find the
one spot in the cycle where the exhaust valve tappet screw (farthest one) 
comes all the way out, then for a split second the 
two screws are flush in your line of sight, neither are coming or going, then 
right after that the intake starts moving in. The point
where they're flush is TDC for #1. Repeat as needed. Try a few times until 
you're sure you have the right spot. As soon as 
you're sure, make a mark at 12 O'clock on your fan. You can find it mentioned 
in Wilson where you're setting the valves
after a rebuild, or in Muir, probably under the valve setting index 
references.
