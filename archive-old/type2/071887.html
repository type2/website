&gt; I understand that a late model(76-79) bus tranny could swap directly with my
&gt;73.  I am interested in doing this because the later model transmissions
&gt; have a taller 4th gear, thus allowing fewer rpm's at say 70 mph.
&gt; Anyone done this, or swapped the gear themselves in an early transmission?
 
Yes last year I found a 72 bus in a garage with only 76k original on it but 
it was in a flood and the entire drivetrain was rotten. I had to throw it in 
the dumpster and instead I installed an 091 tranny from a 78 bus, and a 1974 
1800 mystery motor which I put new rings on. The late tranny is more 
comfortable, but a tighter fit during engine installation/removal time. the 
pilot shaft is longer but it will fit. Do yourself a favor though and replace 
the clutch and seals before putting the motor in. My method is to remove the 
bumper &amp; the muffler, and jack up the bus, slide the motor into place, jack 
the bus down then get the jack under the motor, up and in. guide the pilot 
shaft into the clutch carefully - don't let it get caught !
