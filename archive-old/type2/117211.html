Subject: T-4 Oil Sump Plate O-Ring needed 

Bus Boys has this o-ring. They want $6.00 for it. Is there anyone or
anyplace local to me (Arlington VA/DC area) that has one? I tried Olympic
Auto parts with no luck. They also could not find it under the part number
Bus Boys lists 021-101-269A. I really need this sucker as mine is totally
shot and I was hoping to get one in the next day or so. If anyone can help
let me know. Otherwise I guess its Bus Boys and and _at_#$%^- load of shipping
charges for a little o-ring.
