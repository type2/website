Over &amp; above the stock gauges of speed and fuel:

1. Oil pressure - probably most useful for knowing when engine is in
trouble! Below 10 psi, start worrying.
2. Oil temp - ease off after 220, get worried at 250
3. Cyl head temp - Useful for showing short-term temp rises, such as when
doing a quick burst on a motorway or climbing hills. Can get quite high
without damage but prolonged high readings show trouble. Say, maybe, 450??
4. Ammeter - v. useful for showing charge/battery system (I've not got one
though)
5. Voltmeter - also good for battery performance (get worried below, say, 10
volts).
6. Voltmeter on 2nd battery
7. Rev counter - for over-revving, when to change gear, etc. not completely
useful but something to amuse oneself with.
8. Clock - err, to tell the time?
9. Compass - distraction?
10. Fuel pressure??? Difficult to install in rear engine car
11. Vacuum - see 10, but probably quite useful

PS I've always wondered what to do with the controls if you have low oil
pressure; revving up gives higher rpm = higher pressure, but then higher
revs are going to wear engine more. Should you switch off? Idle? Do nothing?
Also, shows low oil level by pressure drop in corners - but then you should
check the dipstick!!!!!

RE:	Gauges

Can anybody provide with input on what are desirable gauges for my 81
Westy?
Sorry if this topic was in the archives, but I don't have web access

A PO put an oil temp gauge in : ), I was wondering if a cylinder head
temp gauge made sense too.  What are expected oil temp and cylinder head
temps?
In addition to the oil temp gauge and the possible cylinder head temp
gauge, I was planning to add a volt meter. Was also thinking of oil
press., but a couple of people had voiced opinion that the idiot lite is
fine for this application - comments?

P.S. if anybody knows where I could get a sensor for my Mallory oil temp
gauge, I'd appreciate it.
