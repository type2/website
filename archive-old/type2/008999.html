This sounds like one goes to the cold start injector, one goes to the
thermo time switch (under the manfold, on the block between 3 and 4)
and one goes the aux. air valve (under and to the right of the cold
start injector).  What you'll need to do is get the wiring diagram 
and check the continuity on each plug terminal and find where they're
supposed to end up.  It's tedious but not difficult.

&gt; Hmmmm...NOW I remember why you're supposed to label wires when you take them off.
&gt; 
&gt; Got a question for you:
&gt; 
&gt; There are 3 plugs that look like fuel injector plugs, but are not. They are close together on the wiring harness and  color coded. One has a blue casing; one black; one brown. Anyone care to match colors and connections? This wiring harness has not been modified; it's from a '77 bus. I have two such harnesses and they're both the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Thermo time switch = ?
&gt; Auxiliary Air Regulator = ?
&gt; ? = ?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think the third plug is to the cold start valve; I think that one is beige like the injector plugs.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
