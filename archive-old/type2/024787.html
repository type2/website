Subject: solar panels (was: Converting a Westy Icebox)

I have the same solar panels as David Schwarze. (In fact David helped me buy
them; that was about 4 years ago -- how time flies...) I've got 4 of them
mounted side by side on my Westy poptop and their combined output is about
8A and that for about 6 hours a day. If the fridge uses 8A and runs 24
hours, the panels are obviously not enough to sustain fridge operation
indefinitely. In short, unless you drive a bit every day and have your
alternator kick in, the panels will not be enough, except on weekend trips
when you can leave with a fully charged deep-cycle aux. battery and come
back Sunday night with a drained one.

But this is a non-issue, since I yanked the fridge out of the bus long time
ago. (An icebox is so much more convenient and since it loads from the top
--not from the side-- the precious cool doesn't escape every time you open
the lid/door.) I still use the panels to run my laptop, a fan, and reading
lights at night. Not having to run the engine to recharge the battery is a
nice thing.

The real problem with the panels, aside from their cost, is that they are
fairly heavy, perhaps 30 lbs (?) and create an imbalance on the poptop which
causes friction in the flimsy poptop hinges. The hinges bend over time, and
when popping the top, it now feels like the panels weigh 80 lbs. Perhaps it
would have been better to mount them in the middle of the poptop, not at the
rear...

If I were to redo this, I would buy *flexible* panels. They're lighter, less
fragile, and less affected by partial shading. So under cloudy conditions,
they may actually produce more power than a higher-rated panel. Being
flexible, they're easier to mount on the curved poptop. In fact, if I could
sell my rigid panels, I would buy the flexible kind. Wanna see them? They're
at http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/lebus/panel.jpg and I'm in
Alabama.
