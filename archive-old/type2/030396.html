Volk,

I am sorry to say that at the moment things are a bit rough with the poor
list.  What has happened is as follows:

On April 1, atlasta_dot_net (our host in GA) ceased operations.  They,
however, have another operation in Seattle, WA called digital-galaxy_dot_net.  
When atlasta shut down, the list was temporarily transferred to a machine,
quantum, at digital galaxy while our machine was shipped across country.
At the same time, the list &quot;address&quot; was moved from atlasta to
digital-galaxy in the Internic database.  The problem is that, tho
internic is now updated, that update must propogate to each machine on the
net before that machine can send mail to the new address.  Here we are a
week later and some machines have still not updated their databases :-(

In addition, the copy of the list software that is running in Seattle is
more than moderately defective.  Because this situation is very temporary,
I have been &quot;putting out fires&quot; rather than going in and doing a wholesale
repair on it.

Solution:
If you are having problems getting mail to the list using the
type2_at_type2_dot_com address, try the following address:

type2_at_quantum.digital-galaxy_dot_net

this should get mail to the list (or at least to the list machine)  But
also note (*IMPORTANT*) that this is strictly temporary!  We will be
moving back to our own machine very shortly and when we do, this address
will stop working!

Lastly, for some addresses, the list is steering them to &quot;off-list&quot; even
tho the address is valid.  I am fowarding these by hand as fast as I can,
but please be patient.  OTOH, if something does not propogate within 24
hours, please forward a copy to me and I will try to get it out (the
computer may have found it tasty and swallowed it whole :).
