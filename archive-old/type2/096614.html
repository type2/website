Subject: fuel line query

Hi everyone

I am very new owner of a VW bus, having recently bought a 1980 
T25. I have a few simple questions, which someone may be able to 
help with as I await the delivery of my Haynes manual. 

Looking underneath, I noticed a slight leak at the fuel filter 
and have decided to replace both it and all the fuel lines. 
However, the previous owner kindly filled the tank  before 
handing over the van. 

My questions are:
1. What is the best way of draining the fuel tank?
2. How much does a fuel tank hold?
3. Once the fuel lines are replaced how do you remove the air 
from the lines. 

I am sorry if these seem really simple questions, but please 
forgive me I am a complete novice at this. 

Best wishes

Andy
