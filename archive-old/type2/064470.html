Subject: : Re: under coating on cargo floor

&gt;   I am thinking of putting some of the rubberized undercoating
&gt;   stuff on my cargo floor (after dealing with any rust)

I should point out that the Ziebart guy quoted me $129 to remove all the
old undercoating, treat the rust (with something that looks very much like
POR-15), and apply new undercoating. 
This sounds like a very nice deal

Could be! Two points I would consider  1. What kind of a job will the Ziebart guy do 
since it really isn't the kind of job anyone does with  TLC (except a Vdub fanatic). 2. 
How good is a Ziebart undercoating, a) they drill a bunch of holes in your van and b) 
they spray this tar stuff into the holes as well as underneath the van, after a while a 
lot of the tar stuff lifts off giving salty water an opportunity to seep underneath the 
remaining tar stuff, IMHO defeating the purpose.
My solution has been to remove rust, paint and then regular washing, inspection and 
re-paint.
my $0.02
