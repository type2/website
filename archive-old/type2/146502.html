Subject: runs now but won't idle

hello, again,
       its been awhile since my last post and now i have new and
different problems.
before the bus was bogging down and having power issues at
intermediate intervals.  it also seemed to be running rich, blackend,
fluffy stuff on the plugs, black spray from the exhaust.  sent goethe
the two tone bullet into the shop.  got her back.  they said they had
made some minor adjustments.  got back my 1975 FI automatic beauty and
had the same problems.  run then die at stops.  run then lose power
and bog.  i decided cost be danged i was sending goethe into the shop
until she ran.  they had her for a week.  got her back and she now ran
better but idled low and when i first started her i would have to sit
on the the gas pedal to keep her running.  she ran and then bogged and
died once after two days of no problems.  i let her sit while i went
and enjoyed the shakespeare festival.  after sitting for 4 hours she
started back up and ran no problems.  since she had died once i sent
her back into the shop for another week.  this time when i got her
back she idled low when i started her and even when warmed up would
more often then not try to die on me and often would unless i sat with
my foot on both the brake and the accelerator, safe, huh.  she has not
bogged down when driving around and only once from a stop.  now, here
is my question.  could the problem be the throttle vavle switch, and
if so, where can i find one?  i have in the past 2 months put in a
rebuilt afm, a new temp sensor 2, fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel
pressure regulater and new plugs.  i can't afford to sell her at this
point nor do i desire to do so (usually), but i am getting so
frustrated with her not running well she is no longer a pleasure to
drive.
