Subject: Re: [T2] What to do?

I just put a 79 engine in my 74. here is what I had to do:

-Had to change the fuel tank cause FI has a return line.
-change the flywheel.
-Had to make and weld a mounting bracket to the frame rail for the fuel
pump.
-Transfer the wire harness that goes from the double relay to the starter to
the fuel pump.
-Cut hole for the computer.
-Cut off the breather box mount from the 79 and weld it to the 74 ( measure
twice, weld once!!! ).
-Mount the deceleration valve to the fire wall.
-Mount the double relay to the fire wall.

The hardest things to do was cutting off the breather box mount from the old
van without ruining it, and cutting the hole for the computer.
Took me about 3 weekends to do the whole thing.

The interior stuff should all fit but some of the floor mounts might be in
different places and you may have to drill some holes for the sink drain and
vent.

I have 3 FI engines and have not had any big problems with them. Just make
sure the vacuum hoses are all in good shape.

hope this helps,

good luck

Joey.


----- Original Message ----- How about an engine swap? More power would be
nice but I've heard
&gt; stay away from FI. If I were to swap engines, do I just have to change the
&gt; flywheel and clutch or do I have to change the bell housing as well? How
&gt; hard would an engine swap be?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to be so longwinded, but the owner is going to junk the 78 here in
the
&gt; next week. So any or all input would be grately appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
