Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

Jason,

Ummm....I must have been asleep for about 10 years or something...

What? notoriously *hot* t4 engine are we discussing here??????

Moisture laden air is able to absorb more heat or cool cause it is 
&quot;thicker&quot;....or as the physicists among us will call heat absorbtion 
factor.  More molecules of water in the air means it is denser and can do 
more &quot;work&quot; to heat or cool.

Splashing a lot of water on the bottom of the case always helps too!


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking again (always dangerous) about helping the aircooled engine 
&gt; run cooler and came up with an idea that I wanted to bounce off of The List. 
&gt;   In lieu of spending up to $250 for an external oil cooler and dealing with 
&gt; the mounting and thermostat issues, I was thinking about alternatives that 
&gt; help keep the notoriously-hot T4 engine cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; I was driving in the rain yesterday, and noticed that my engine temps were 
&gt; much lower than they usually are on this same route.  I got to thinking (see 
&gt; first sentence) about the cooling and evaporative effects that water has on 
&gt; the aircooled engine, and wondered if the &quot;rainy day&quot; condition could be 
&gt; replicated on dry days.  I live at 8,000 feet elevation, and the air up here 
&gt; is very dry and pretty thin, so its cooling effectiveness is not as great as 
&gt; it is in thick, humid air environs.
&gt; 
&gt; My &quot;rainy day&quot; theory is that road spray on the bottom of the oil sump adds 
&gt; more cooling, which makes the oil cooler.  Also, the increased humidity 
&gt; (both from rain and road spray) gets pulled into the fan where its 
&gt; evaporative effects add more cooling to the cylinders and oil cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; I came up with the idea of a &quot;water injection system&quot; which goes something 
&gt; like this:  A windshield washer reservoir on the left-side battery tray with 
&gt; a low-pressure pump that could be actuated by a momentary switch on the 
&gt; dash.  A hose runs from the reservoir to the tin in front (RIF) of the fan, 
&gt; where water would drip onto the tin and get sucked into the fan.  Water 
&gt; droplets would either flash into steam or get atomized by the fan, get blown 
&gt; over the cylinders, and add humidity and density to the cooling air.
&gt; 
&gt; It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with 
&gt; localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.  
&gt; Anybody care to jump in on this one?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for listening,
&gt; Jason Upper
