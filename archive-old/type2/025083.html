&gt;  VDO makes an oil temp sender that takes the place of the plug for the oil-
&gt; pressure relief valve that fits on the underside of the case near the 
pulley, 
&gt; on a type 1 motor.  This is a good location because it senses the temp of 
the 
&gt; oil that's headed to the main bearings.
 
A few years ago I ran an oil temp sender in the oil pressure relief valve 
location that you suggest.  At the same time I had a thermocouple attached to 
one of the case bolts.  The readings I got from the two locations were 
identical.  Both in temperature and the time it took to get to that 
temperature.
If you want to know what your oil temp is the &quot;plug for the oil pressure 
relief valve&quot; location will not tell you.
If you want to know your oil temp on a type 1 engine use a dip stick sender.  
I'm not sure what senders are available for the type 4 engine.  If I were 
doing it I'd use the round cover plate at the rear of the engine as my access 
point and install a sender that extends at least 2 inches into the oil.  The 
issue is that the case runs at least 20 degrees cooler than the oil and takes 
much longer to heat up.
If you screw a metal sender into the case and the sender isn't really well 
thermally isolated from the case you will read the case temperature.  Metal 
conducts heat much better than oil.
The best way to know how hot your engine is getting is a CHT gauge.  On the 
type 4 engine you can cut off the big circle on the sender and wedge what's 
left between two fins near the spark plug.  It's not difficult and will give 
you useful information instead of vague indications.  Vague indications, 
however are better than nothing.  But if your going to the trouble of 
installing a temp gauge, why not install one that gives good information?
