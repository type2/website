Subject: Re: [T2] Correct tire size for westy

From: &quot;Mathew L. Nardone&quot;
&gt; I just got a pair of Cooper Wildcat 185/75/14's for my '78 Bus. A friend,
&gt; who owns a '78 Westy, recommended them as a comparable performer (not
&gt; strictly comparable) as the Bridgestone 603V's I had mentioned to him. I
&gt; haven't had them long enough to comment on performance, especially since
&gt; they were replacing the studded snows that came with the vehicle. Any
&gt; comments on the Cooper tire, and secondly, what is the aspect ration a
&gt; measure of: Height/Tire Width?

WRONG size!
The correct size is 185R14. With no center number, the aspect ratio is 82. The
aspect ratio is the difference between the width of the tread and the sidewall
measured in %. A 82 tire has a sidewall that is 82% of the width of the tread.
i.e. if you had a tire that was 10&quot; wide, the sidewall would be 8.2&quot;. With a
75 series tire, the same 10&quot; wide tire would have a sidewall 7.5&quot;. Here is a
site where you can put in the correct size and then the replacement size and
see the difference:

However, 82 is not listed.....you have to use 80.
Your better choice would have been 195/75......
