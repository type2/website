Jamie, I would REALLY love to see a photo of your pump / filter 
installation.

My '76 has the pump mounted on a frame cross-member, and it is 
connected to the filter with a fairly long 10mm hose that has a big 
bend in it in order to get to the pump inlet.  My filter is actually 
kind of hard to reach because of where it is located.  The 10mm hose's 
bend nearly bumps right up against heater air Y junction.  I would love 
to use a short length of 10mm, if only to make the filter easier to get 
to, but I just don't see how I can do that on my Bus.

My pump appears to be located in a stock location, judging by the very 
stock-looking holes that are drilled for access to the pump bracket 
nuts.

I will take photos once my Bus comes back with its fresh fuel tank 
(which damn well better be no later Thursday evening, considering I am 
supposed to leave for a camping trip Friday morning).

Richard Atwell noted the difference on my Bus, commenting that his '78 
fuel pump is mounted in-line with the length of the bus, and I believe 
he also has a very short length of the 10mm hose between the filter and 
pump on his Bus, as well.
