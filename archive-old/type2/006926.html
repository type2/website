In a message dated 99-01-27 14:30:46 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; To accommodate the difference in length between the two generators you must
 change the gen. backing plate and the fan hub.
 goforit! &gt;&gt;

Which backing plate goes with which generator? One is concave and one is
convex. The bug generator is shorter, and the bus generator is longer and
heavier. Does the longer bus generator get the concave backing plate to
realign the pulley geometry after they engineered in a longer 38amp generator?
And how vital is switching the fan hub when doing a 30 to 38 switch? can they
be accidently interchanged on the side of a toll plaza with the snake lite
fading, only to haunt the motor forevermore with a slew of belts snapping? 

Otherwise the motor is fine, great compression 65 on the highway the works but
pulley snappage. backing plate changed. uncertain whether fan hub was also
switched but must rule out before opening it up to look for internal probs.
has anyone encountered pulley snapping every 100 miles or so following a 30 to
38 switch. The belt size also changes to the smaller 900mm? Are there changes
in the generator pedestal through the years on T1 vs T2s and the pedestal you
reach for in the dirt by your feet might not be the one that goes with the
particular application, perhaps its a cal look aftermarket alternator stand
thats been spraypainted, would pedestal sizes change between 30amp, 38amp and
alt?  any advice appreciated. chris
