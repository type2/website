Subject: [T2] Perishing Rubber Sealant?

Just a quick one.

The rubber seal on the flat top of my Devon roof is perishing and as the
British Autumn(Fall) sets in the rain is smearing a black deposit all over
the white fiberglass and paint on the roof of my van.

1. 	Is there some sort of sealant that I can paint onto this rubber, the
seal is fine, just to keep it from staining my roof.

2.	What can I use to get this rubber stain off the white fibreglass and
paintwork.

I appreciate this isn't a very common problem and so I may have to just pick
something, try it and learn by my mistakes.
