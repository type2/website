&gt; WILL NOT SEAT on that tit so I can put in the 3 bolts.  The holdup is the

make sure everything is lined up and there are no burrs etc.  I generally
pull it on with the bolts, use a couple longer ones to get it started if
the stock ones are too short.

turn it in very slowly make sure it is straight and is moving smoothly,
you shouldn't have to put much torque on it to get it to go.

&gt; the trick?  Oh, yeah, engine is out.  Also the hub seems to be stuck on even
&gt; though I took the bolt off--I'm concerned with damaging the rear main seal

do it CAREFULLY and slow.
