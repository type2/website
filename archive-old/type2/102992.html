Subject: Emission testers: I sell those

  OK,

can't help making a comment here.
I sell exhaust gas analyzers.
Therefore you may presume me biased, but of course I think I'm not.

Testers for the serious hobbyist or small workshop are for example:

Gunson.
The Gunson units are terrible. They work on the &quot;exhaust gas 
conductivity method&quot;.
This is 1930's technology and it shows.
The Gunsons take forever to warm up, the drift is faster then the 
measurement, and they can only try to measure anything at idle (no real 
pump).
They are to be set at 2% CO in ambient air, which mystifies me.
Forget Gunson.

There are better units.
The &quot;Motortest&quot; units work. But they suffer from lack of quality. The 
jetting is primitive, the sensor is of the screw-in type, which is a 
problem for vibration and conductivity. The motortest service is variable.

Bosch makes a very nice unit. It is so heavy duty is will last forever 
and you can use it as a floor stand if required. The Bosch unit is the 
standard of them all.
But have you ever tried to deal with Bosch as a private customer? I 
think they like to talk to you starting at 1 million spark plugs (made 
in india or japan).
The Bosch unit ETT 008 retails for approx. 1500 US$ + tax in Germany.

Then of course there are my units sold almost everywhere except in the US.
Actually 500  went to the US and were sold with the Snap-On logo.
Another company that is difficult to deal with.
Contact me offline if interested in anything or if you just need info.
Smallest CO tester starts at 355 Euros minus VAT, next one up is 595 and 
has oxygen measurement by means of chemical cell, and Lambda 
calculation....a.s.o.

Sorry for the shameless plug.

Question: are there web pages were I can look up exhaust gas limit 
values for US emission testing?
Can't find anything. I need %, not grams per  mile.

&gt;&gt;am considering buying a exhaust anyalizer but the decent ones are $$$$

&gt;
&gt;. He feels is it very close in accuracy to his 5,000
&gt;snap-on analyzer. They cost about 250 euros new, but the one in the ebay_dot_de
&gt;link is cheaper than one trip to get a test.  There is a British company,
&gt;Gunsons, who make a similar unit. For some reason these testers are not
&gt;popular here, but are in europe.
