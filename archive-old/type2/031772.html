&gt; I'd be wary of the one piece engine door seals.  I purchased one online 
&gt; recently and it wasn't even close to the correct dimensions.  This thing was 
&gt; way too large and I have the big door (1970).  If you do go the one piece 
&gt; route and get a good one, I'd appreciate hearing from you about it.  I'd 
&gt; still like to find a good one piece seal.

I would like to find a &quot;Good fitting&quot; engine top hatch seal for my 78!!
