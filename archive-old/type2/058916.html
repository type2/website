Subject: 71 Passenger Brake, Shock, &amp; Misc. Work

Put my 71 passenger bus on the road again after being up on stands for
two to three weeks.  During that time I cleaned, sanded, primered, and
painted all four wheels.  Painted the rear brake drums.  Replaced rear
brake shoes and wheel cylinders(both products from Brazil).  Replaced
the rear brake lines(Mexican).  Replaced the front brake lines(German).
Flushed all old brake fluid and bleeded system.  Lubricated the entire
front end and ball joints(I was surprised to see the grease fittings on
the ball joints-this project took about 6 tubes of grease).  Replaced
old Sears heavy duty shocks with new Gabriel Gas Classic shocks(lifetime
warranty) at $14.99 each.

Anybody know why the front brake caliper has two bleeding tubes?
