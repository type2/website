Subject: [T2] Oil pressure sender

Re having both oil pressure light and gauge, back when I first bought my 77
(new) I put in a VDO oil pressure gauge.  The sending unit had two
connections: G went to the gauge and WK went to the oil pressure light so both
functioned from the same sender.  (Ground came from having the sender bolted
to the case.)  Haven't looked at what's available now, but aren't they still
the same?
    As for hooking up a buzzer, that's a great idea.  In fact, early on I
disabled the buzzer that goes on when you have the door open and the keys
still in the car (way too annoying) and thought of trying to hook up the oil
pressure light wiring to that somehow, but never got around to figuring out
how to do it.  Anyone else do this??
