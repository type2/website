Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit(longish)

Wayne,

I didn't reply to this until I read all of the other posts...

I guess my *opinion* is a little different then everyone else.

I have been driving various VW's since 1966.  Started in a 65
bug.  Drove it very carefully and did *all* of the recomended
maintenance according to the manual.  Dropped a valve at 70 mph
and 44,000 miles.

My belief(after using Stanless steel valves) is to drive the ever livin 
daylights out of the engine...AFTER....safety concerns are met.

I'm betting the Dr. Porsche is turning over in his grave right now after 
listening to folks talk about limiting this and that.  If I remember 
correctly from all of the VW/Porsche history that I have read, that Dr. 
Porsche believed that the engine should be capable of max power all day 
long...without overheating...which to me also means max rpm's if you can 
get there.

In all of my years of driving VW's, I have destroyed 3 engines...a dropped 
valve got my first one, and a thrown rod got the one in my 67 split 
window and a broken crankshaft got my 65 double cab in the middle of the 
worst blizzard in Pennyslvania in 30 years..  I have driven a 72 that I 
rebuilt at over 95mph *just once*.

So, to make my point clear, what is the difference between a T4 engine in 
a Porsche 914 and a T4 engine in a bus...yes, yes, I know that there are 
some, but would anyone tell a 914 driver of a newish 914(in the 70's) that 
they couldn't drive the daylights out of it?...yes, there are reasonable 
RPM limits, and they should be followed, but I doubt that any bus driver 
is going to ever see 5400 rpm in 4th gear in a bus....

If the weather and wind are nice, I can't understand why I should limit 
myself to 65mph in a bus with a T4 engine...and I have driven my at 75mph+
on the interstate for over 4 hours at a time....no big deal to me.

I have driven my 67(with a 1641 engine) in the early 70's for over 14 
hours at a time across the southwest desert and thought nothing of it.
I did *not* limit my speed to 65mph.

I generally do this with engines that *I* have carefully rebuilt...if I 
didn't do a good job, then I fully expect to learn from my failures....and 
apply that new knowledge to the next rebuild.

My motto....drive it like ya stole it!...unless you want 235,000+ miles 
out of an engine.  Then, be carefull, limit your RPM's and top speed and 
you too might make several hundred thousand miles out of a vw engine like 
some of the list members.

Cheers, dave

&gt; OK, here are some questions that would help me better understand the 55mph
&gt; limit (particularly for my '79 bus):
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 1: What is the recommended redline for bus engine?
&gt; 
&gt; 2: What is the recommended highest cruising rpm?
&gt; 
&gt; 5: Why is a sustained speed bad for the bug engine?  Is it just high temps?
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Mind you, I'm not that comfortable driving my bus that fast on the highway
&gt; with crosswinds and big 18 wheeler to toss us around. I just would like to
&gt; better understand the limits on the engine.
