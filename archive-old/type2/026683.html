I want a nice paint; but I don't want it to look like
a Lexus.  Is a Basecoat/Clearcoat system going to be too fancy looking
for an old VW?  What looks right for a 1970s VW? 
-------------------------------------------------------
Eric, I painted my pastel white 71 Westy in a bright white and deep red
2-tone, which isn't original, but has the fun look I wanted.  I used 2 stage
Diamont over bare metal/VariPrime/PolyPrime and it looks very nice, but not
original.  I would use single stage if I were to do it again, not so much
the look, but because it's a little harder to correctly touch up 2 stage
solid colors, especially white, compared to single stage.  So, I think you
have to decide what you want, original or stand-out different, and between
looks and practicality.  IMHO, in terms of originality, the correct color is
going to be more important than single versus 2 stage.
