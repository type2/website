&gt; About 20 years ago I remember reading that the Playmate of the month claimed the same thing

&gt; the vehicle in neutral before crawling underneath someone will take the keys away from me
&gt; first.

People make mistakes for many reasons.  How many times have we gone to
turn the engine during a valve adjustment and found the bus to be in gear?

I've seen nothing to indicate that this gentleman was drunk at the time of
the accident.  Let's not embellish the story.
