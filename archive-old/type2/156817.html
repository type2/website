&gt; You mean I might be going even slower than the speedo reads?  Tell me it
&gt; aint so, please!

Yep,

At 58MPH (actual) my '71s speedo reads 70MPH.  I'd fix it, but I have a
GPS to give me accurate speed and it's kind of fun to watch passengers
catching a glimpse of the speedometer reading 75!
