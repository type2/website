Subject: [T2] '71 1600DP intake manifold

My apologies in advance if this message makes it to the list a couple more times
when my mail dequeues from my other ISP...please ignore the duplicate
posts.

Anyway, here's what is probably a very silly question, but perhaps pertinant
to problems I'm currently experiencing:

On the carb-stand/intake manifold for a 1600DP, should there be a HOLE
connecting the heat riser tube pipe and the intake manifold pipe?

I'm only asking because I am 99.9% sure that there IS a hole in my 
manifold pipe that connects it to the heat riser tube, and I'm trying
to track down a vacuum leak and got to thinking that that hole shouldn't
ought to exist.  Unfortunately I didn't think to ask this question when
I first noticed the hole and while I still had the engine out...

thanks,
