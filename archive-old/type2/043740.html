&lt;&lt; ntermittent red light on
 On the way home from High Country Bus fest, My generator light came on
 brightly. Fan belt fine. Started up, three miles down the road, back on.
 Stayed off after restart, but I was only 2 miles from home. Any ideas?
 Voltage regulator?All connections look fine, and was a very bright light.
 
 High Country Bus fest was GREAT. Hats off the Mike Myers and my buds from
 the Full Moon Bus Club.

check you gernerator brushes  there is one on top and one underneath. they 
should be above the lvel of the holder.  they are rectangular solids of a 
graphite type stuff- not what I expected brushe sto be at all!!!  luckily 
they are fairly inexpensive.    

I find if the light comes on more at idle then it is brushes, and when it 
comes on with revs, it is the regulator, and when smoke comes out of the 
generator,  and I change the generator and it happens again.  there was a is 
regulator that fries the generator.
