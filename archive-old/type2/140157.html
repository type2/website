Subject: A REALLY dumb question

Hi Volks- I got two ***205 distributors at a local VW show this weekend.
They seem tight. I would like to lightly disassemble them (points, vacuum
can,etc.) and stick them in an ultra-sonic cleaner, followed by an alcohol
bath to remove the water, and then treat with a spray of lubricant. Is there
anything inside the dizzy that will be hurt by this process? Time and moving
restraints preclude a total disassembly. TBear

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
