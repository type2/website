&gt; I've had the same reservations expressed by Jan-Willem.  I think that
&gt; the concerns might vary depending upon the characteristics of the
&gt; vehicle being tilted.  In the case of the Type II, I would think that
&gt; the stub axles and hubs could take the strain (gently) and that the
&gt; front suspension torsion arms would be up to it, but I would feel
uneasy
&gt; about the side loads that the device would place upon the rear
&gt; suspension.  At the rear, the load would be distributed among the
spring
&gt; plate, the trailing arm, and the drive axle.

Nope, the load would be taken by the spring plate and the trailing
arm, which together make a very strong triangulated swingarm.  The
axle never takes any axial loads.  Normal dynamic loads on these parts
are much greater than any static load that this device can impose
unless you do something stupid like drop the car into the tilted
position!

I didn't particularly like the web site's demand for demographic data
before allowing access to the price list.  Not a nice thing to do!

&gt; 
&gt; If anyone would like to see one of these devices (as well as a
rotator),
&gt; one of the manufacturers, Accessible Systems, has a web site at:
