&gt; jack stand were to give it up then you have the ramp as a safety..
&gt; &gt; Course I am a tad claustrophobic. :-O I will use jackstands but also
&gt; &gt; have a bunch of short pieces of 2X4.. I make a crib with the 2X4's
&gt; 
&gt; I have a number of 4X10s about 2ft long I use for cribbing under the
&gt; center of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; for a safety net.. the thought of a bus coming down on me just creeps
&gt; &gt; me out a bit.
&gt;       
      Overkill...All you really need are a couple of turns of old clothesline
around a limb of the old apple tree to hold up a Bus...We're all shade
tree mechanics, aren't we... ?-)
