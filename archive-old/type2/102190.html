Subject: Transmission Bell Housing

Question:  on a 1979 Type2 donor, if the engine is removed,  but the 
transmission is still in the vehicle, is it easy/or/difficult to remove JUST 
the bell housing??  Also, rear axles are still 'attached', transmission is 
held up with a chain...

Note:  this is not a Poll, which is only allowed on Fridays, but a serious 
inquiry (a dumb question), which is allowed most any time...

Barry
