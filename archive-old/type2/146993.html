Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser tubes

Thanks to everyone who replied. I was not talking about the half moon 
piece of tin but the flat asbestos (sandwiched between 2 pieces of sheet 
metal) gasket with one large hole and 2 small holes between the heat 
riser flange and the muffler flange. I'm tracking down a vacuum leak and 
didn't know if the heat riser was hollow from this point up to the 
intake manifold. Apparently it is not so I can eliminate the heat riser 
gasket as a source.

Thanks again,
Bill

&gt; heat.
