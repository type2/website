Subject: whats a good price for a 78 camper?

I have a 78 camper model that is an automatic, and I was wondering what would
be a fair price to sell it?  It needs work to it for the camper stuff and
exterior, but it runs good except for the problem of breaking down whenever we
go up hills.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated..
