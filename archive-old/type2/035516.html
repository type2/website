DOH! i completely forgot to mention that im located at ft. meade, in between 
baltimore and washington DC...sorry for leaving that out...
i dont know how much it costs to ship a tranny, it would probably be cost 
prohibitive except to someone local (ive never shipped one of these things)
its an IRS tranny, i dont know what year. im inclined to believe its an 
older one.
