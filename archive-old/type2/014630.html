I like the wooden emblem idea - if properly eurathaned and treated - i
bet you could have the beauty for years - maybe i'll try that - i have
some artisan friends always looking for a new problem to solve - i'll
get them on it right away - let you all know how it works out - 

i also thought maybe a wooden glovebox with a pretty chrome accent for
the pull - maybe a wooden dash if you're good with your wooden - and
have the right tools for forming -
