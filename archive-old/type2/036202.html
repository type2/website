Subject: Fw: Strange Cylinder Wear?

Trusted listees,

First, let me say that I know little if anything about identifying
cylinder/piston wear.
Now, in the ever-so-long process of rebuilding my 78 2.0 litre, I pulled the
cylinders today from both of my donor engines.  All EIGHT cylinders had the
following strange condition:

On the &quot;sleeve&quot; of the cylinder, one side of the circle is what appears to
be a machined half-rectangle.  Directly across from it is a moon-shaped,
semi-circular groove which does not appear to be normal....  All the
cylinders have varying degrees of this half-moon.

Can anyone help?  Is this a normal machine process or is it a sign of wear?
If so, are the pistons (about which I'm equally ignorant) inherently
faulted?
Considering the somewhat exorbitant price of cylinder/piston sets... uuggh.

Thanks for any help!
