   I still have a few of the Empi Inch Pincher toy buses left and all that
have bought these from me are on my list for the next EMPI bus coming out in
November. It's the EMPI CHRISTMAS bus. I will post photo's when available.
If you would like to pre order I will need a CC to confirm, you won't be
charged till shipped.

sorry for the bandwidth but these are very limited and wanted to pass it on
