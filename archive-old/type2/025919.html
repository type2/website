&gt; Heck, I am STILL trying to get two teaspoons of oil into #3!!  How do you do
&gt; this without spilling some all over the place.  I can use a squirt (oil) can
&gt; with a flexible neck, but how do I know I got the 2 teaspoons in, or did I
&gt; squirt oil all over the place??

Easy. Get a device that will measure exactly 10ml, like a children's
measuring cup, or exactly 5ml (an old measuring teaspoon will do) if you
can't swing a 10ml measure. Squirt oil from your can until you've filled the
measure. Write how many squirts it takes to get to 10ml on the side of the
oil can, preferably scratched in so it won't go away.

When you need to put the oil in the engine, just squirt that many squirts.
