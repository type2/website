There are pictures of my '62 &quot;Flip Seat&quot; Westfalia camper on Michael Heron's
web page.   Way way down at the bottom of the page.

This is the blue bus with the SK1032 paint code.  I sent the Type II mail
list a copy of VW's reply to my VIN query a couple of weeks ago.  &quot;SK&quot; means
special color.  In this case, I believe it means special for a Kombi.
Kombi's are not normally color finished in the cargo area.  The camper
interior is painted blue all the way back. In any case, the car has never
been repainted. You can look at the blue yourself.

The views through the cab doors are with the front seat flipped over.  You
can see part of the flip seat mechanism and the back of the seat up against
the steering wheel on the drivers side. 

The Side View picture is the same bus.  In the photo the bus is a couple of
weeks old.  The picture was taken in Europe in 1962.

Thanks Michael!
