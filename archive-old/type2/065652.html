&gt; I've got a '71 pop-top in which I'd like to put an original German Solex

&gt; one side. It tends to leak a little gas.

&gt; I'm told that this is a common problem with old 34 PICT-3s.

Archway Imports (a parts place in St. Louis) lists in their
catalog a &quot;Solex Carb/Bushing Kit&quot; which looks from the picture
to be a drill bit, a reamer, and some bushings.  I imagine
you would need a drill press to make sure it was square.  They
also sell just bushings (8 and 3mm, where they go I know not).

The tool kit (item # 2050) is $55, the bushings (8mm: #2051,
3mm #2052) are $2.  I haven't used this kit, and don't
even know if it's the appropriate thing.  Archway's #
is 314-638-7700.

Whatever you find out, post to the list--there are lots
of leaky 34 PICT-3's out there.

'62 Kombi
34PICT-3, doesn't leak (yet)
