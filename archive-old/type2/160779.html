&gt;   My question is that
&gt;it has a Bosch distributor VJR 4 BR 18.  It fires right up but I'm unfamiliar
&gt;with this distributor.  It looks pretty worn.  Anyone have any info on this
&gt;distributor....pros/cons

Typically, those type designations are from the mid 60's and earlier. 
The way to determine if it will work for your application is to 
observe it's advance with a timing light. If total advance is close 
to that published for your stock dizzy, then you are good to go. I 
know I have somewhere some literature that identifies many of those 
early dizzies, but my cursory search could not find any. I researched 
the issue thoroughly many years ago and found a nice Mercedes unit to 
fit my Porsche.

To determine wear, set the points block on top of a lobe, then push 
the shaft back and forth and observe the point gap. If it opens and 
closes very much at all, it needs new bearings. Most if not all of 
those early dizzies can be rebuilt with new bronze bushings. Best of 
all are the cast iron units. They have a provision for adding oil to 
the shaft, and a felt ring between the bearings to hold the oil. 
Those when serviced reasonable, like the felt under the rotor on 
later models, just never wear out. The one I took from an early 60's 
Mercedes was tight as a drum, no observable wear at all.
