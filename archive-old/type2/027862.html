&quot;Chet Needham&quot; &lt;busboy_77_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;:

&gt;&gt;I'm having a problem locating tires for my '77 Westy.  They have '185 SR 
&gt;&gt;14' on the existing ones, and no one seems to have these in stock.  
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately I had a blow out this morning, and have to get these ASAP. 
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions on where to go? &lt;&lt;

This is the correct size.  I got mine in the Federal brand which is made by 
Dunlop.  There are others out there too.  They were not a stock item but 
only took overnight to arrive, and this was at a mom&amp;pop tire shop, not a 
big name place.  They were $65 ea. for the load range D.  Don't get a C for 
your Westy!

John
