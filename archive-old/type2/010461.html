Subject: Re: Does transmission gear oil ever wear out?
Message-Id: &lt;199910262036.NAA12654_at_townshend.mtest&gt;

	YES. I always change it when I buy a used vehicle if over 100,000 miles
or 10 years old. Worn-out tranny oil will allow the gears to wear more than
they should, an ugly spiral. Change it now, and you'll be impressed
at how much better the synchros work too!

&lt;&lt;  I notice that the transmission is hard to shift when I first start 
 up, but it gets easier as it warms. Does that suggest I should dump the old 
 oil?  &gt;&gt;
