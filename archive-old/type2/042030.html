Subject: Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club Web page

Dear members and friends,

The Volkswagen Type 2 Club Web page has moved to a new server and now has its 
very own URL. So if you have our web site in your favorites/bookmarks or have 
been kind enough to give us a link from your own web site please can you 
update them to point to

www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk

Recent additions to the site include a short report and pictures of our 
recent AGM and a couple of new &quot;members' rides&quot; sent to me in the last few 
weeks.

Good luck
Bob Wallace
Web Site Manager
VW Type 2 Owners Club
