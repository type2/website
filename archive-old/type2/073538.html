Howdy howdy,

I don't know how much my question pertains to the list, but I figured if I got
it in as a &quot;friday question&quot; nobody would mind. 

I am graduating high school this year and I own a 72 kombi, my first vehicle.  I
love and respect my van, I have learned a lot from him and feel a special bond
with him.  Yet, I have been offered a free 1998 Ford Escort for my university
years to come.  As a student, I find that owning the van would be financial....
crazyness. Low gas mileage, high maintenance et cetera. But I just cant seem to
justify giving up the van that I love for a dependable car (the ford is in
perfect condition I might add...).  

So, I'm just looking for some good old fashioned advice here. I figured that
maybe someone out there has possibly been through this or something like this
and so can give me some insight.  

Absolutely anyone's two cents would be greatly appreciated also. I am really not
able to decide here. Help!

Thanks for your time!

I think there should be something in science called 
the &quot;reindeer effect.&quot; I don't know what it
would be, but I think it'd be good to hear
someone say, &quot;Gentlemen, what we have 
here is a terrifying example of the reindeer 
effect.&quot;
