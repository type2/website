now I'm waivering 
between the cigarette lighter/ceramic heater vs. a
gasoline heater available 
in a local wrecking yard.  I am also having trouble
getting the stock system 
in top shape.

3.  I hear repeated success stories from the gas
heater 
users and don't 
doub't their ability to make a vw warm.  My question 
however is pertaining 
to whatever disadvantages they might have.  Is there
any chance of carbon 
monoxide poisoning?  What precautions would be taken
to 
avoid this and how 
reliable are they?  Also how do they compare to the 
electric heaters in 
terms of both power draw and niose?  Is the
installation 
procedure worth the 
amount of work necassary?

I can't answer all your questions, but I wouldn't
depend on an electrically powered heater for much, for
reasons given in other answers to your questions.

When we used to drive a bus year around as our only
vehicle with 3 small children in Wisconsin, where some
weeks 20 degrees below zero was an average
temperature, we installed a gas heater (maye a BN4??)
from a beetle in our 1974 bus.  I put it under the
front floor, inside the removable cover that protects
the underside of the pedals, etc.  It blew heat at the
passenger's feet.  A mechanic friend sold it to me in
running condition with new stainless steel exhaust
fittings, and it did a great job.

I kept the heater and have photos of the installation
somewhere, but can't find them at present.
