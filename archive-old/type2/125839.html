Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA distributor

   I have sold close to 50, 034  SVDA dizzys  in the last 6 months (currently out of stock). They have all been used on 
normally asperated engines from 1600 stock to 2110 performance and every type 4 (1.7, 1.8, 2 litre) non fuel injected 
or converted to carb engine all with great resuts, or at least no customer has complained yet.

  The latest has been a 2 litre type 4 converted to Kadrons (EMPI KIT) with a Low Budget Racing vac base conversion 
and larger venturis with the SVDA 034 out of the box.

   The only thing I have found is different vac advance movement based on different vac signals sent from different 
dissplacement engines.

   On my own personal VW's I have the 034 on a New MEXI 1600 with Pierberg 34 pict-3 (I find these carbs much 
better then the Borosal) another New Mexi 1600 with a ENGLE 100 cam and German Solex 34 pict-3, my 1800 stroker 
with duel Kadrons, 1885 (85.5X82) stroker with duel 44 webers (reworked).

  The most notable difference I found were on the stock 1600 and the 1800 stroker, both increased fuel mileage, 
easier starting and appear to run cooler as I do not run any gauges, don't need the fear factor. It seemed to hurt the 
1885, went to an 010 instead of the 009 that was originaly on it. And I found I got a hesitation and slower accelleration 
on the 1600 with the Engle 100 cam with the 034 so going to change the springs to see if it will help.

  The next engine I am going to use the 034 on is a 1904 I am building using mostly CHINESE parts for a durabilty test.
Parts made in China being used; Crank, rods, pistons and liners, prototype cam and heads (not available in the U S yet)
lifters (cam followers), flywheel and PP, cylinder studs,  push rods and rocker arm assemblies, case is Brazil/Mexico 
and the carbs are SCATS 35 mm duel Solex kit, unless they have the 38mm solexs when I am ready to run it.

  I also hope to have the new CHINESE 009, 010 and 050 dizzys by then to test also


rumor has it that the chinese also bought the VW Beetle plant and tooling from Mexico and are going to manufacture 
Beetles in CHINA. Can't sell the complete car here but will be offering them in KIT form!

&gt;I took apart and old beetle distributor last night for the first time and
&gt;they are remarkably simple inside. If you haven't been to Glenn Ring's
&gt;website it's worth a peek:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.glenn-ring_dot_com/010/
&gt;
&gt;It's very clear to me now how they wear out and how they seize/loosen up.
&gt;Until I read some Lucas articles about how these distributors actually work
&gt;I wasn't that interested in disassembly.
&gt;
&gt;I have been trying to find out what exactly is inside that makes one bus
&gt;dizzy unique and it seems to be the stop plate and springs. Springs vary in
&gt;size and shape and the stop plate is Bosch numbered which makes sense but
&gt;the weights aren't so I would guess that's mostly a shared item within a
&gt;family of distributors.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I'm really curious what exactly aircooled_dot_net does to that mexican unit
&gt;they sell as the SVDA.
&gt;
&gt;That 043-905-205 (0 231 170 034) beetle dizzy has these spec according to
&gt;oldvolkhome_dot_com:
&gt;
&gt;8-12 degrees of vac advance
&gt;7-12 degress _at_ 1600 rpm, 20-25 degrees _at_ 3800 rpm
&gt;
&gt;The late bus FI requires:
&gt;
&gt;8.5-11 degrees of vac advance
&gt;8-13 degrees _at_ 1600rpm, 20.5-24.5 degrees _at_ 3400 rpm
&gt;
&gt;That seems so close that it's not worth performing any modification to the
&gt;mexican distributor at all it would seem, at least for the late bus
&gt;application.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone bought the beetle distributor directly from CIP1_dot_com and dropped
&gt;one into a Type 4 engine?
