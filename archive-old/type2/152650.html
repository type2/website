Subject: Yellow Bucket

We had one in our  Westy back when we were using the upper, lower and  
hammock for us and the kids.  Our good friend, Tina, a Lufthansa alumnus,  told us 
that it is for Diapers or other  use is for adults not willing  to go out into 
the coolness of a dark German night for  a much needed  relief break, if you 
know what I mean.  German Engineering, what can I  say?
 
With that in mind, perhaps a nice scubbing is in order.
Chuck
