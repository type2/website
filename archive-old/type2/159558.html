Subject: ADMIN: Re: [T2] Good bye, all

The admins have repeated the goals and charter of this list hundreds of 
times.  Despite this, some people &quot;get it&quot; and others don't.  This never 
  ceases to amaze me.

This list has been around for over 12 years - longer than theSamba or 
any other VW forum that I know of.  People come, and people go.  Many 
people have mistaken impressions of this list.  They think it's a 
democracy, that it should be changed to better suit their needs, or that 
the list owes them something (all wrong).  These people are free to 
leave and start their own list, or join one that is more to their liking.

It is not the job of the admins to police this list beyond what actually 
happens on the list.  I do not frequent theSamba or any other VW forum - 
I don't even read every post on this list anymore - I don't have the 
time.  Therefore I do not know &quot;everything&quot;.  I'm sure many listmembers 
have skeletons in their closets that I do not know about either.  I 
prefer it that way and I'm sure you all do too.  We keep it simple here. 
  Until Mario decides to leave, or violates the charter of this list, he 
is free to post here.

I hope M.R. Nimmo is in a happier place now and that we will still be 
able to drink beers together by the campfire at the next bus campout.

Now please let's get off of this topic once and for all.  No more 
insults, no more jokes, no more &quot;Hey, good one Larry&quot; posts.

Thanks.

&gt; someone who is to be protected by these admins, it's
&gt; time to walk with my feet.  
&gt; 
&gt; It's funny because I remember how quickly you kicked
&gt; Arky the Master Race guy off.  Yet a criminal remains
&gt; on the list.
