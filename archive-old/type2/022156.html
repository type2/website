&gt;Can anyone tell me how to duplicate the finish in a 71 Westy? I have the

&gt;the finish on the old panels. The stains I found are either to white or too
&gt;yellow. Any help would be appreciated as this is the last thing I have to do
&gt;before putting the bus all back together so I can go play. Any help would be
&gt;greatly appreciated. TBear

TBear,
What is called for is a custom mix.  You can do it yourself or have it done
at a good hardware store.  It will probably be a mix of  what you have
used.(too white/too yellow)
Remember  that the tone or darkness of the final finish will be a result of
how long the stain is left on before wiping it off.  It will also be
affected by the finish coat.  Few finishes are truely clear, most give a
yellow or amber cast.

Try different mixes &amp; finishes on scrap birch and you will get a good
match.  You can write the mix &amp; finish used in pencil right on the scrap
wood where you will use it, prior
to staining.

Good luck, 
Pat
