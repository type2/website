&lt;&lt; Yes, it's a lot of money, but not for what you get.  It's not just a bunch
of plywood.  It includes literally EVERYTHING you need to turn an empty bus
into a full-blown camper - the sink (with electric pump and fresh water
tank), propane stove, 12-volt fridge, cabinetry, hardware, and instructions
(easy assembly - think Ikea). Everything is there but the upholstery for the
sofabed.  &gt;&gt;

So I guess the idea is this comes as a kit and you must assemble it?

I think it is a great idea, but I'm not sure how many bus owners would pay 
the cost.  I think you could get a complete running westy for that amount of 
money.

Reimo in Germany still offers cabinets and poptops for bus, vanagon and 
eurovans.  I sell quite a few Eurovan cabinets, but there isn't a lot of 
interest in the bus or vanagon stuff.  The poptop roofs alone would cost at 
least $3K with delivery.

The cabinet kits are shipped unassembled.  The pre-laminated sheets of plywood
 are cut and drilled on a large computer guided router.  They pull up the 
cabinet drawing on the computer and feed the sheets of plywood in the 
machine.  It's pretty cool to see it.

There used to be a do it yourself camper book printed in German for the bay 
window bus.  I sell the Vanagon and EuroVan versions, but the bus book is out 
of print.

The Vanagon and Eurovan books show you how to build cabinets and include 
patterns and instructions.
