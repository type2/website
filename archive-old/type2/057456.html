watts RMS total).....to my knowledge everytthing is stock......will i be
hurting anything?(since it is sorta old), and is there a way i can hook up
another battery in case i drain it and relive strain?( i know i saw it
somewhere), and is puttint a new ?alternater?(right part)? in there whould
provide enough current? keep in mind that the extra power will come ni handy
