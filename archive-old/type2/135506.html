Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Diesel in a Bay

I thought the idea was to go for a higher gear ratio so that the diesel rpms stayed low... The baywindow tranny is not exactly a high geared beast in my opinion (and I have not done the work you have so I am but an amateur). 

Most the diesels I have driven (MANY Fiats and VWs) ran out of go at 4K rpm and were much happier at 2-3K rpm. 

The vanagon gas tranny was a higher ratio than the vanagon diesel tranny? 

FWIW I LOVE diesels. Drove them often when I lived in italy where gas was nearly $5 a gallon in the early 90's.
