&gt; I found a 1980 Vanagon (in a storage yard) its been there for three

&gt; The Vanagon has a 1972 Porsche 911T engine in it with a 5 speed tranny
&gt; and mechanical fuel injection (needs a $1300.00 fuel pump) he says. He
&gt; claims it to have a 3.2 Liter engine vs the lesser desirable 3.4 Liter.
&gt; All of which means nothing to me.
If these displacement numbers are correct, run don't walk away. In 72
the 911T came w/ a 130hp 6 cyl. Here is the issue I see. the 2.7L are
know as being notorious. Many design problems plague this size engine
(mostly trying to do too much with the same engine). they had a tendency
to pull the head studs right out of the block. the 2.4 is supposed to be
very solid, &amp; a working (key word here) Mechanical FI is supposed to be
top knotch. I havn't owned a 911, yet, but looked very seriously at them
for a year or so. I can't find a displacement that matches either 3.4 or
3.2. at least untill after 83. I would suspect his knowledge if these
numbers are correct. 

2.0, 2.2, 2.4 _good_ 2.7 _bad_

http://www.rennlist_dot_org/FAQ will give you some more information if you
so desire. :)
