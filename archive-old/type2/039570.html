&gt; &gt; of a lack of angle.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you disassemble them?  It is possible to put them together wrong and
&gt; they will jam up in this condition.  You supposedly can take them apart
&gt; again and put them together correctly.  Try this before spending $$$!

yes, yes!
george is absolutely correct.
you must disassemble, and reassemble until they move freely.
this is pretty much a trial and error kind of thing, unless you managed
to remember which ball went into which race.
since that is pretty impossible...
and it really doesn't matter THAT much, you just have to 
swap the balls around a bit...
sometimes you can figure out which one is hanging up, and swap it with 
one from the other side.. don't take the whole thing apart each time.
keep some grease on it.

they can be pretty thrashed and still work.
patience pays off.
