Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Compartment Seal

--0-329242956-1021735440=:11207


 Irony of ironies....I just did this very thing about 2 hours ago for the very first time on my 72 westy and had no idea...fortunately, I reasoned the same and did it right...because I am a 'wannabe mechanic', little victories make the day.  Yesterday's victory was installing a window in the door correctly.  Hopefully,  this afternoon I can conquer a shifter bushing or two....
Thanks for the continued tips!!

&gt; Just bought a new engine compartment seal for my 1979 Riviera Camper
&gt; with a 2.0 liter Type 4 engine. My question is - does the &quot;rubberized&quot;
&gt; side of the seal go on the inside of the engine compartment or does it
&gt; face down towards the ground?

Andy (said Steve, sticking his tongue firmly in his cheek :-),


Well..... in the spirit of the day..... UP!!! the shiny side goes
*UP*!!!! :-)

In large part, it makes little difference, as the whole idea of the seal
is to block air. as long as the air is blocked, the rest is cosmetics and
the shiny side up looks better, don't you think?



Actually, of course, Karl and Bob are correct, the purpose of the &quot;shiny
side&quot; is to keep oil from the engine from impregnating the seal and it
*ought* to go toward the more likely oil source (that is, down)

For many years, tho (before the list), I did install them shiny side up
for appearances sake, and they never gave me a problem :-)

These days, I have not seen a seal with an actual &quot;shiny side&quot; in the OEM
sense in many years. Most are extruded &quot;H&quot; sections and it makes no
difference which side goes up or down.
