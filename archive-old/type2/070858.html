Subject: Timing--TDC--Tom Wilson
Message-ID: &lt;a9e207dc.24bcca22_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Looks like I've started an interesting thread. Several people wrote me with 
directions on how to find out when my engine is at TDC, missing the point I 
was writing about--I can't believe I've used Tom Wilson's book for two 914 
engine rebuilds over the past 10 years and now this Type 4 bus engine and his 
directions have always screwed me up on being about to start a newly-rebuilt 
engine. Being a hobbyist and not a pro and building only an engine every 4 or 
5 years, I didn't know where my problem was or what I was doing wrong.

&gt;  I have a question on timing the distributor, crankshaft and the
&gt;camshaft.  I think I understand how to do this, but I'm not sure.

&gt;  We should align the distributor so that it points to the notch, by
&gt;rotating the crankshaft which is temporarily placed in the case,
&gt;indicating that it is in the #1 position.  Once we do this, we will rotate
&gt;it 

The crankshaft or the distributor?

&gt; 90 degrees, and remove the crankshaft.  Next, we install the crankshaft
&gt;and the camshaft together, with the two-notch mark on the crankshaft
&gt;pointing to the bottom of the case, and matching up with the one-notch
&gt;mark on the camshaft.  

If the two-punch mark on the crankshaft is pointing to the bottom of the 
case, you can't align the single cam punch mark because the single cam mark 
will have turned away from the crank punch marks.

&gt;Now, with this in, when we rotate the crankshaft up
&gt;to top-dead-center, the camshaft and the crankshaft will be properly
&gt;aligned, and the distributor will point to the #1 position mark.  Is this
&gt;procedure okay/correct?

I think you align the crank and cam marks sitting in the case ready to 
install, turn the crank and rod #1 to TDC and then install the distribution 
drive and distributor and set the rotor to the TDC distributor mark based on 
the crank's TDC position, and then clamp the distributor down so it won't 
change. The old TDC position of the distributor is irrelevant unless you can 
re-install the same angle of the top split of the distributor drive as it was 
before. 

And don't follow Tom Wilson's directions . . .
