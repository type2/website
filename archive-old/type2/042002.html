&gt; It is extremely expensive.  Not just the parts...Getting quotes of 180.00
&gt; for all four (german).  But Labor is rediculous...

I had my torsion arms off the beam and took them into a local shop with the
ball joints that I got from BusDepot
   Ball Joint, original German (68-79 Bus) $16.95  211 405 371A  ($67.80 +
shipping for 4 )

The old ones were pressed out and new ones in at their leisure, cost me $20 for
labor.

Total hit was less than $90.

The key here is that I had the spindles off and the only labor that I had to
pay for was the actual pressing and not the assembly/disassembly of the front
end.
