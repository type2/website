Subject: RE: [T2] KONI Group Buy Shocks - UPDATE

In one day we have already sold well over half of the Koni shocks.  We have
sold a couple more sets of fronts than rears, so in order to keep things
even, from here on out I can only take orders for fronts from people who are
also ordering rears (in other words, no more orders for fronts-only).  Since
I do have a couple extra pair of rears at this point, I can still take a
couple of orders for rears-only, but that too will probably change shortly.

Front:
