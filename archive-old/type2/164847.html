Subject: Re: [T2] Changed my brake fluid and now I have NO brakes, what
  did I  miss???

Fill the reservoir.Fit a clear plastic hose on the bleeder,
and the other end in a clear jar. Or not.
You could just dump it on the ground.
Open the right rear bleeder. Go have a beer.
When the bleeder drips fluid with no air bubbles,
close it and open the left rear. Go have another beer.
Got the idea? OK, do the right, then left front.
You will be done before you finish a six-pack.
And no more silly pumping. Get the wife a day job.

&gt; I just got done doing my brakes with the help of my wife (since Duroc seems
&gt; to be nursing an illness).
