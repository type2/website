I've made up my mind, I'm selling my bus. It's a '72 with dual carbs.
Inside is in okay shape. All original, orangish interior. Sink doesn't
pump though.Orange body has some surface rust, a few dents, including 
one big one, but not that bad on the front end. Definetly not a good 
looking bus but a good camper(hard top) Engine is okay, runs, but carbs 
need synchronizing, tuning. I'll make you a good deal.
Hope to hear from you,
                   Simon King
