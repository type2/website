OK, well, thing s progress  and forward for a change :-)

First, let me express my profound thanks to John Anderson, Ken Hooper, and
everyone else who has helped physically or morally.  This list is the home
to some of the greatest!

Second, I gotta give a thumbs up to Foreign Aide in Albuqueque, MN.  They
are obviously adapted to dealing with the busted bus traveller :-)  they
took me in, diagnosed, and are working hard to get me going again, even
given the &quot;frankenbus&quot; nature of the current FI system. I don't know if it
will pan out yet or not, but they are doing good work as far as I am
concerned and get a two thumbs up.

Third, let me make it clear that so far the troubles that I have been
having all fall under the heading of standard &quot;shakeout troubles&quot;.  About
the only thing that really gets my goat is the original delay caused by
Con-way damaging the negine in the original shippin, and the subsequent
delays that pushed installation and testing back to nearly my departure
date.  At some point I need to do a detailed list of who struck who and
when, but the only real problem is time.  

Got to have lunch today with John Kyte here today, and met &quot;Everywhere Ed&quot;
who dropped in at the restaurant we were eating at to deliver the local
free newspaper :-)  John has a *very* nice '58 he is currently pushing and
patching :-) and is a heck of a nice guy.  One of the things that is hard
for me, a bus-deprived rust-belter, is the condition and number of buses
of all vintages that is see on the street here and elsewhere in the
salt-free zone!  My eyes bug every time I see a splitty stoped at a light,
because we just don't see them outside shows in the east.  And being at a 
large repair shop, the bugging is pretty continuous :-)

I am running out of time on the library computer here, so I will wrap up.  
See y'all down the road!
