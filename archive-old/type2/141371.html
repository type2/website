Subject: RE: [T2] Thermostats for $55 found

&gt; http://store.donscoperformance_dot_com/043119159.html
&gt; You can get them for $22.95 from Donsco VW.
&gt; I just ordered one myself.


Careful - based on the price (and no mention of it being German), this may
be a Mexican thermostat. (If it's German for that price it's a bargain, but
it would have to be very old stock, as that is way below cost!)  I'd
certainly advise checking before ordering one. The Mexican thermostats are a
totally different design and have a major disadvantage as compared to the
German ones. In the event of failure the Mexican thermostat fails in the
closed position (causing the engine to run at maximum temp, potentially
causing engine damage), whereas the German one fails in the open position
(causing the engine to run cold if anything).  See
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?p=689659#689659 .  Also,
while the Mexican style can be used on type 1 engines, it will not fit a
type 4 engine without significant modification to the themostat mounting
hardware.

As Ratwell noted, availability of German ones is spotty. (I snap them up
whenever I can find them, and have a fair number on hand now, but I never
know if my current inventory will be my last.) So at some point the Mexican
ones may be the only option anyway, unless an aftermarket alternative
surfaces.  Supposedly one is in the works but so far it's been
rumors/promises rather than anything concrete (and even then it remains to
be seen what the quality would be; it would almost certainly be Chinese).
Meanwhile, as long as German ones can be had, they are worth the price
difference.
