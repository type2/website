Subject: driving w/o windshield [was: replacing windsheld and rubber together?] 


Amigos!

I couldn't *dream* of driving across town without my windshield. Forget 
about how the police would feel, or even about the effects of Oregon rain in 
December--where would I put my Roger Rabbit suction-cup stick-up doll??

Okay, seriously.

I've gotten a lot of good advice from the type2 crew--splitting 50-50 on 
some of the main issues, as one would expect/hope from this list. Sorry I 
haven't yet replied to everyone who posted.  Meanwhile, I've found a place 
in Portland OR that looks like it has good prospects when it comes to 
installing window seals and glass. We have some more talking to do, but I'll 
post the details to the list when I have a better idea of what's what.

best
