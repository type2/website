Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Concerns

Don,

If it runs fine now, the biggest thing is to keep the fuel filter
changed out and to replace *all* of the fuel lines from the gas tank
all the way around the fuel ring and back into the gas tank.

Once you get past the pump, the pressure on the hose runs from 28 to 37 
psi..

Be sure and get the correct filter and the absolute correct hose from
a reputable VWflaps place.  Be sure and let them know it is FI fuel hose 
you need.

Cheers, dave

&gt; All of the recent questions about fuel injection has got me wondering about
&gt; the FI system on my 75.  All appears to be running well with out any
&gt; problems but is there any thing I should be doing to keep it running in top
&gt; shape or should I be checking the system as a preventive maintenance item to
&gt; find problems I do not know about that may cost $$ down the road.
&gt; I know nothing about fuel injection and to date if it hasn't been a problem
&gt; I look the other way.
