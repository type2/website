Subject: Re: adj hytr lifters-where to start

Rereading my assessment of adjusting hydraulic lifters (re why it ran
worse at 2 turns in) and David Schwarze's, got me thinking....
  The function of the hydraulic lifter is to provide zero backlash while
running, and requires that the piston of the lifter be within the free
play range it has.  If too close to the circlip end (like only 3/4 turn
in) you will get more free play and slapping while pumping up and less
functional valve opening.  You'll get longer engine life if you are lazy
due to tendency over time for valve lash to lessen, but more wear on the
lifter and more uneven engine power if valve is hardly open.  
     Ideally,the lifter piston should be in the middle of that free
range at all operating termperatures and general wear over the miles.  
Would be nice if someone measured how far in one 360 degree turn moves
the piston.  The lifter standing in front of me (minus circlip and
spring) shows an eyeballed ruler range of just above 3 mm- how many
actual turns is that?  So staying 0.5 mm from each extreme gives a free
range of +- 1 mm.  I remember reading that hotrodders do adjust solid
lifters to zero lash HOT, and I think when it cools, the lash will
increase a few thousands?  Since the engine when hot LOSES valve lash,
wouldn't it make sense to adjust while HOT to midrange (and assume it
will increase a bit when cold).   Advantage of this is that the lifter
will be pumped up more and feel more solid also.  Downside is that I've
done it and you have to be careful of the HOT parts.  Contrary to Dave's
assessment of the difficulting in telling when free play is removed and
when you are bottoming out due to air, I can feel when there is air
(wiggle the rocker and feel the sponginess of the lifter spring) and
eyeball when the adjusting screw is just hitting the piston...key here
is to have no binding in the adjustor screw, and twirl it back and forth
to just feel the contact.
