Subject: RE: [T2] High Head Temp (Long)

Dave et.al.,

Thanks for all your comments and suggestions.

I'm pretty confident in my CHT and oil temp gauges.  The CHT is a Dakota
Digital and I tested the OT before I installed it.  The OT read 212 in
boiling water.

I closed up most of the tin the am and hope to take a drive later.

I looked at the cylinders from below the bus this am and they look clean -
not sure what's above.  I did notice that that the oil cooler appeared to
have air openings that I could see from below.  It is at all possible that
the PO reinstalled it 90 degrees in the wrong direction?  I need to do some
more research here.

Thanks again,

Wayne

Wayne,

You absolutely must verify that the senders/gauges are actually right!
Or at least close enough for government work.

Yes, you desperately need the rest of the sealing parts...especially 
around the spark plugs.  Stick your hand in there, rev the engine up and 
feel how much air comes out.
