Subject: RE: spray bed liner

&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Peter Sedlack&quot; &lt;keroac_at_proaxis_dot_com&gt; =====
&gt;Hi All
&gt;
&gt;Say, I was reading the FAQ's about soundproofing and such and had a
&gt;question. Has anyone ever used that brush on stuff for bed liners on the
&gt;inside of a bus? Or for that matter, has anyone had a professional spray job
&gt;done?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Pete

I haven't had it done to either of my buses, but a lady I teach with had it 
spray on the bed of her husband's 96 GMC Pickup and the bed is still in great 
shape.  The only thing he doesn't like is that it is almost impossible to 
slide things across the truck bed.
