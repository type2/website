&gt;I have been working on T1 engines for a while now. I just got my first bus with a pancake engine in it, a 72 Deluxe with a 1700 dual carb. How in the hell do you get to the spark plugs without taking off tin?

Spark plug socket with extension.  No biggie.  If you need to, look down the hole first to see where you need to aim the socket.

&gt; While checking compression I dropped both rear most plugs (#2 &amp; #4) and can't friggin get to them, they are inside the tin!

Rare earth magnet on a stick.

&gt;BTW, compression was #1=60, #2 =60, #3=70, #4=95. ARe readings this low cause enough for the engine NOT to start. 

That's marginal compression, but it should still start.

&gt;Also, I found that place on one of the carbs where the idle shutoff solenoid screws in is stripped, causing the shut off not to tighten down.  Will this keep the engine from starting?

It could make it harder to start, but if the solenoid is physically in it's proper position it shouldn't make too much difference.  Wire or rubber band it in if you have to, for now.

Check valve lash before you jump to any conclusions about compression.
