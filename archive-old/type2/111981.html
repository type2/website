Get behind a truck with both LEDs and conventional bulbs and you'll see
that the LED flash on instantly while the bulbs require a fraction of a
second to heat their filaments to incandesence.

&gt; Cool? Yes

This is one item that is high on the cop's fix-it-ticket list, at least
here in SoCal.  Taillights have to have at least a red lens inside so that
they will show the correct color no matter what color bulb is placed
inside.
