Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

I located some muffler paint from the Eastwood catalog for $10. says:

&gt; High-Temp Protection for Exhaust Systems
&gt; 
&gt; Easy to apply aerosol formula covers exhaust components from the manifolds of
&gt; headers back.  Great for protecting hangers and tailpipes.  An
&gt; aluminum-colored coating that withstands high temperatures.  Not recommended
&gt; for catalytic converters, manifolds, headers, or head pipes.

If the high heat auto paint I used was for headers burned off how is this
going to work when it can't be used for those applications?  I guess a cat
is too hot for it.  Probably so is a VW?

It has a picture of a muffler on it so it must work. ;-)

&gt; I bought the POR brand silver exhaust paint for 70 Westy and had similar
&gt; results, despite a thorough cleaning with the stuff in the kit. It looked OK
&gt; for maybe a week, then the blistering around the top exhaust flanges started
&gt; . The muffler retained it's coating for a few months before the rust
&gt; started....Next time, I guess  I'll have to  breakdown and get the ceramic
&gt; coating : (   Scott, it may be worthwhile to mention that since your Bultaco
&gt; is a 2 stroke, it's exhaust is much cooler than any VW engine so the paint
&gt; you used will have a better chance of survival. The exhaust on my dirt bikes
&gt; has always been easier to keep paint on than any automotive header system
&gt; I've had.
