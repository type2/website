Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

If there is enough to get vice grips on, don't chew it up further with vice
grips.  I haven't followed the thread 100 percent, but folks a good PIPE
WRENCH would beat any tool for removing the stud...after a long bout of
soaking, tapping as per GM Bulley's gramp.  Good luck. PS: the wallyworld
Popular mechanics pipe wrench is a no-no.  Use a good one or you may as well
chew with vice grips.

&gt;IF you have enough for vice grips you can probably DIY. Lots of Liquid
&gt;Wrench, tap a lot, heat, don't twist too hard. Then it MIGHT come out.
&gt;Ian, who's actually done it.
