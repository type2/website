Subject: Update Pt. 2

I put the first 150 miles on the new engine.  Seemed to run well, and
after advancing the timing some, I cured most of the dieseling.  All I
got on the last time I turned it off was a single &quot;pop&quot;.  Not a
backfire, really more of a burp.  I'm going to advance the timing a
little more, but I'm getting worried.  At idle, I've got the timing at
~11 degrees BTDC.  Isn't this getting high for a Type IV engine?  Or
should I just be worried about its maximum advance? (050 mechanical
distributor).

The first gauge results are in, as well.  The CHT gauge gives me ~325
degrees once it all warms up.  Oil pressure starts out around 60 psi,
but as it warms up drops to around 21 psi at 3000 rpm.

There's a slight worry, however:  when it's warmed up and the rpms drop
to idle speed, I've gotten an occaisional oil light flicker, which
according to the gauge is just under 10 psi.  I'm using straight 40 wt
Castrol, and the temp isn't going wild.  I haven't lost any oil, so I'm
wondering if it's something to do with the pump?  Could a valve be
failing to close?  Or is it that the stock VW sender is just so low that
I normally wouldn't see this, and it's just that the VDO sender triggers
the idiot light at a higher psi?

Again, any and all thoughts on these matters are welcome.  Those who
have replied have been great reassurances/teachers.
