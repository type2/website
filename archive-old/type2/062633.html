Subject: Old Tires

I purchased a parts bus last Feb which has tires on it that are in decent 
shape as far a tread goes and seem to hold air fine, but they are old.
I don't know how long they have been sitting (in a field) on this bus but
I suspect for several years.  They are the old nylon belted type I believe.
I would like to use them for the rest of the summer and save my &quot;good&quot;
tire for the winter when I really need them.  I this a totally stupid idea.
Has anyone had a blow out a 60 mph.  Does the bus handle that OK (like a car)?
Also is it more important to have good tires on the back or the front as far
as blow outs go?  
Thanks,  I will certainly take your responses seriously especially if I am 
putting myself or others in danger.
