&gt; The bus is a '75 with the original 1800, &gt;however, the EFI was gutted and

Well, it's either an 1800 that had twin carbs originally, or a 2000 that had AFC FI originally, it's conceivable that you have a 75 with an 1800, but it must be a real early 75, since all the 75s I've seen had the FI system and 2000 motor. Check your chassis and motor number.  Anyway, I just when through this after rebuilding a 71 FI 1700 from a sedan for use in my 73 bus. I'm trying to make a holley progressive and an 009 work together in harmony. I've found some comfort running with the timing set at ~6 btdc at idle. Make sure your points are within range first.This setup isn't perfect, because the van idles at 1450 -I'd like it to be 1,000, but so far - no luck.

The biggest problem I'm having is the vacuum. Holley washes their hands of all old kits they made so I had to home-make intake to head gaskets and am looking for store-bought ones. Anyone know who supplies these?
