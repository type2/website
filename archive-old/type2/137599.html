Subject: More vac dizzy fun on 71 1600 dp...

It's me again, and I'm back troubleshooting my '71 1600 dp engine in my '68 
bus.  My first question is this, where does the brake vaccuum booster plug 
into on a 71?  Since I have a 68 I need to make sure this vaccuum port is 
plugged up.  There is a nipple on the intake manifold (driver's side), and 
one on the left side of the base of the carb, pointing up and to the 
left.  The later is already blocked with a large bolt.

I think I've figured out which two ports on the carb to use for 
advance/retard.  Well, at least I'm confident I'm getting advance while at 
speed.

Now, I've got the ignition from my 68 (coil, vaccuum advance distributer, 
Petronix), and I was thinking that I could take the coil and Petronix unit 
and install them into the 71 engine that I'm running.

Or, would it make more sense to pull the entire distributer.  The 71 engine 
is running pretty well except the idle is poor (it often stalls), and there 
is a hesitation at low RPM.  I'm transporting the bus to 800 miles from 
Chicago to DC on Monday, so I'm risk averse :-)  I can't mess it up.  But I 
still need to replace the cap/rotor/points/condensor and reset the timing 
since the engine has an unknown history.  I should mention that

1.  I haven't adjusted points in 10 years
2.  I don't own a timing light (yet)

Well, what's the opinion of the group?  Should I move the Petronix, move 
entire distributer (vac advance only, no retard to worry about), or just 
replace the points.

P.S.  I did set the valves today.
