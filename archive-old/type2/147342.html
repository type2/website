Subject: Re: [T2] Dip stick boot I found a easy way

As a boat mechanic, I've had much practice sliding hoses, both vinyl and 
rubber, onto a variety of different fittings. The one thing that has 
worked for me, after many trials and tribulations, is silicone spray. 
Hands down, it has worked the best.
