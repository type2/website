&amp;gt; I bought if from a vendor

&amp;gt; told that it was the replacement for the bellow style
&amp;gt; thermostat and would work in place of it.

It's a wax motor thermostat used on the Mexi-beetles that the vendors  
are selling because the Wahler bellows are NLA.

&amp;gt; Skeptical, I
&amp;gt; measured it at room temperature and then placed it in
&amp;gt; hot water but I noticed no expansion. Has anyone else
&amp;gt; had any experience with one of these?

Might be best to keep the flaps open all the time instead of trying  
to adapt it.
