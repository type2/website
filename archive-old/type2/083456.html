&gt; Handling seems better now and I'm going to watch the tire wear on this
&gt; roadtrip. Incidentally, in the midst of the alignment work I discovered
&gt; where the clunk in the front end was coming from. It seems the clamp on the
&gt; drag link end had worked itself loose and the drag link end was banging back
&gt; and forth on its threads. (Lucky it didn't come off!). I tightened it back
&gt; up and the clunk disappeared, along with about half of the play in the
&gt; steering, but the damage is done and the drag link end will have to be
&gt; replaced. Can you buy these individually, like tie rod ends, or must you
&gt; purchase the whole drag link? I've only seen the latter advertised.

Better to get the whole drag link.  That way you get fresh ends.
