&gt; The voltage (and therefore the power) delivered by the spark depends

&gt; you force the system to provide a higher voltage, therefore the 
&gt; spark energy becomes greater, therefore your mixture ignites better.

That would imply that one could have bigger spark plug gaps than
recommended for better ignition. It would burn up the distributor
faster, though.

Would it be a sign that the spark plug needs adjustment? Or maybe a 
thorough cleaning?
