I knew that one wouldn't make it through the Lyle filter.  :)

&gt;These days it seems to cost a

Only if you don't immerse yourself in the vehicle, as we do with our busses.  My '93 Mustang has never been to a mechanic, I do all the work (except that for which I lack the proper equipment) myself, just like the bus.  20 years newer, same principles apply.  It's actually simpler than the bus in a lot of respects.
