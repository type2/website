Subject: Oil Cooler Adapter...

Hey Volks,

I was working on installing the external oil cooler that I purchased
awhile ago. I have run into an unexpected problem with the sandwich
adapter I am using. ( See http://www.permacool_dot_com/Catalog/Cat_page28.html )

I can't seem to find a way to mount it so that I can get the oil hoses
on to it. The fittings either run into the case, the engine hanger,
the push rod tube, or the heat riser. (It's a '77 stock type 4.) I see
three options at this point.

I could remove the heat riser. This option does not thrill me as I
like what little heat my bus produces comming to the front. Obviously
I would want to block off the intake to the heat exchanger if I went
this way, as well as seal up the gaping hole in the tin.

The next option would be to install some right angle fittings on the
adapter so that the fittings would point down. This has some appeal,
but I worry about being able to turn the hoses quick enough so that
they wont scrape on the ground going over a speedbump or something,
and yet won't be crimped.

The last option would be to get a Spin on adapter, 
(See http://www.permacool_dot_com/Catalog/Cat_page29.html )
and a remote oil filter mount.
(See http://www.permacool_dot_com/Catalog/Cat_page30.html )

My thought is to try the second option first, and then go for the
third if I can not make it work, but I thought I would see what you
volks thought before I procede? Anybody out there install one of these
on a type 4 before?
