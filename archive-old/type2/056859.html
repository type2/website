Hi all,
Just spent another 3 days off work getting the bus roadworthy again.  We
put the minimum necessary parts together to get the engine running, I
slung in a freshly charged battery and cranked away.  Crank crank crank
... crank crank vrooom!  What a racket - I've heard quieter lawnmowers.
She wouldn't idle though.  I got some fresh petrol in a jerry can and
put that in (the fuel in the tank is over a year old).  Didn't make much
difference.  We found that the idle cutoff valve in the LH carb wasn't
working so I will need to get a new one.  I have been told that this is
a 'dealer only' part but the dealer is quoting 60UKP for it.  Yikes!
I'm sending my wife Ruth on a mission to get a used one today.
Apparently there are 2 or 3 different ones so it may not be easy.
The only other problem to sort out is an air leak in the washer bottle
valve.
Any sage advice about the idle problem would be very much appreciated.
It felt good to be behind the wheel again after so long, even though I
had to restart the engine at every junction.
