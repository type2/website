Subject: Re: [T2] Curiousity, Westy to Sunroof

&gt;From: &quot;Snoopy&quot;

&gt;Easily done if you plan for a full canvas.  To put a stock sunroof in a bus 
&gt;is more work than it sounds like AMHIK!!!

That is what I am looking for. A full canvas top. Know any reputable 
companies out there?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
