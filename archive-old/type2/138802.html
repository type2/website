Subject: 80 Vanagon odometer not working

Took my speedometer out today to see why the odometer isn't working. Found the
shaft that goes through the numbered wheels had backed out of the wheels
enough that the one gear wasn't meshing with the other. I managed to get the
shaft back into position but there doesn't seem to be anything to keep it in
place. The shaft that goes through the trip odometer seems to have a micro nut
on the end to keep it in place. has any one ever taken one of these apart and
know what keeps the shaft in place?

I would really like to know how many miles I have gone between oil changes. If
anyone has a good working odometer or instrument panel for an 80 Vanagon for
sale I might have some $ left over after the rebuild to purchase it.

Thanks
Tom
