Most likely you shorted something out with the water, or severy corroded
some contacts.   At PEP Boys you can get a flowable silicone that is good
for windshields- really penetrates gaps.  Intermittant problems can be in
either switch, connection to it, fuses, or bad grounds?  When in doubt, be
armed with enough wire, tape, connectors, and savvy to bypass things to
stay going!    A pre-FI bus is a snap- all you need is to connect a wire to
the upper solenoid conenction (On my 71 years ago I piggybacked a #12 wire
on the spade connector and soldered it- the minitorch you can get at
Woodworker's Supply is great for this).  Then run the wire into the engine
compartment and simply leave the end wrapped around the battery cable so it
can't touch anything.  You need starter?  Just touch the battery (+); great
for DIY compression checks.  For ignition, just run an alligator clip from
any + you can find near the battery (or use the battery) and have an
alligator clip to grab the (+) connection on the coil.  This turns on the
ignition.  As long as your key still unlocks the _at_&amp;^##%^%#% steering lock,
you're able to go.
    Other areas to check- first eliminate corroded connections starting
from battery to the big terminal on the starter sol. (remove each, get out
the sandpaper and get it all shiny.  A Dreml tool with the fine grinding
tip (looks like a dentist drill) is good for cleaning spade connectors.
Make sure the ground connections are clean.  Find the (+) line going up
front and make sure its connections are clean- the fuses should be freed of
oxidation as well as those _at_%^##$ holes they press into.
