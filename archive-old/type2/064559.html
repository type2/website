&gt;&gt; I admire, without wanting to emulate, those who choose

&gt;&gt; put in the time to do the job myself, I can't put it in on a schedule,
&gt;&gt; so I have to have the Japanese cars that are useful, and affordable, on
&gt;&gt; a non-hobby basis.  

I'd have to agree with others.. my 86' honda Accord was a POS (Pile Of
Shit). In the 8 years I owned it.. it needed: Clutch (twice...)
                              CV Joints
                              Alternator
                              Exhaust System
                              New Upholstery (front)
                              Block Heater (actually popped out of the block
- -- twice)
                              Brakes Galore (more than once)
                              Windshield (ok so rock chip spread.. can't
blame Japan)
                              Cooling system (Rad, hoses etc...)
                              Timing Belt (twice snapped)

As for affordable... BAHAHAHAHA!! Parts for Honda do not come so cheap..
Kennedy-sahn.
Japanese like to make much profit. 

Useful? uhm.. Try sleeping in a Honda Accord Hatchback.. not so useful. It
was able to make love in it once... but it wasn't as comfortable (enjoyable)
as the VW.

Camping... it did go camping many a times, but with low ground clearance it
was hard to get into recreational areas. Useful in City?? perhaps its small
size may have had an advantage and the powerful engine did have a lot of
pick-me-up... Useful for getting speeding tickets.

I am glad I am rid of that pile of Jap Scrap!!  A 23 year old bus may have
had the same amount of work..but it is 3 times older and costs way less to
maintain and repair. Plus, a bus has character. What kind of
character/personality does a plastic smelling, egg-shaped, sterile
jap-mobile have? Not a personality I choose to drive. But, to each his own.

BTW, The repair bills for the Honda totalled more than $5000 (canadian)
aprox. $3,000 US.
