Subject: Re: [T2] Back brake stuck onto wheel

Hi Mark,

Happens a lot. The shoes are rusted into the drums.

Hit the wheel a few times between each of the lug nuts with a big hammer.
Then jump in, rev the engine and dump the clutch. Reverse will get you more
torque than first. Hopefully there's no-one parked in front or behind... it
will likely be dramatic when it breaks free.

This is one of the times it's an advantage to have a standard transmission.

Happy trails,

 &gt; My rear right side brake (I presume the hand brake) seems to be stuck to
 &gt; the wheel . I release the handbrake and the van won't budge. It was only
 &gt; a few days since I was last driving it but had been raining a lot if
 &gt; that has anything to do with it.
  
 &gt; Anyone any ideas on how to unstick it ?
