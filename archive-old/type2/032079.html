Subject: [T2] Re:Westy removal of fridge unit for other use of space

I removed the 'fridge guts from my '78 Westfalia and regained use of that
deep locker there. The non-Champagne edition Westy's with iceboxes all
have a nice locker there and now I do again too!

I keep auto parts, tools, fluids and a little bit of firewood in
there.

It was a great idea. The old 'fridge didn't work too well even when it was
in its prime, I am told. Certainly never worked for me.

I haven't brought myself to remove the transformed under the bench seat
yet, although it serves no purpose without the 'fridge. I ought to pull
that out- regain more space and remove more dead weight.

Free yourself! Regain a cubic foot or two of space!

Drive safely,
