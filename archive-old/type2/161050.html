Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Hubcap Idea

Hi Bob,

The Hubcap has been to Canada twice I think. I had it back in 2001,  
before &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot; was a red pop-top. Jamie Rivers had it about  
a year before that.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; I HAVE LOCATED THE HUBCAP!!!   There is no need for a replacement.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I have the email address of its
&gt;&gt; current custodian.  So... where does it go from there???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Has it been to Canada yet??
