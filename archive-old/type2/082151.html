Subject: Re: [T2] [friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses...

I have one such &quot;art car&quot;  I call it my bus.  It is not an art car or a 
hippie bus or a shaggin wagon or any of the sort it is my VW!!!!!!!!    I 
love it dearly.  &quot;Art Cars&quot; as they put it are not that cool, they don't have 
soul.  They don't mean anything...they are made out of junk...sure some of 
them look cool but that's about it.  For the most part they suck.  But my bus 
is painted, as a sort of homage to the great artists of all time...I have a 
dali, 4 warhols(marlyn, the cow print, shoes print, and self portrait),   I 
have love rising, and an toying with the idea of doing a version of starry 
starry night on the back.  Glued on crap is an &quot;art car&quot; it is not art...

sorry for the tangent.
