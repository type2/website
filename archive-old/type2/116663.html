Subject: High Country Bus Festival - THIS WEEKEND

Hey VOLKS:

Just a few more days until HCBF 7 arrives........I will be heading out on 
Wednesday morning and won't be able to check email after that time.

I have hired an AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHER who will do a fly over on Saturday 
around 2-3pm weather permitting

If you would like to lead a carabus from your area to HCBF check out the 
CARABUS LIST.  If you do not want to register to add your name on the list, 
email me your info and I can post it for you:

FMBC breakfast burritos:  We need food donations to help feed the masses.  
To sign-up:

There will also be a technical workshop, a t-dye clinic and a live 
band.........PLUS much more :-)
