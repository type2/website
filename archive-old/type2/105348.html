Subject: Oil temps

Hi All,

FWIW, that mag we all love, 3VW Tren**2  provided a lengthy article on
synthetic oils in the new April 2003 issue.  They list a number of synthetic
oils and charts comparing various flash points, pour points, viscosity
index, etc.  Sounded pretty accurate, but would appreciate any thoughts on
the article.

Happy Bussing,
Ed

PS  We drove our 72 Westy with new 2.0 rebuilt by AVP  cross country and
oil temps would hang out in the 220-240 (VDO sump gauge) range on the
highway cruising 60-65 mph, getting roughly 18-23 mpg.  We were running
Mobil 1 15-50.
