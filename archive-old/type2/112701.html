&gt;how about the brakes?????

&gt;Yep, I've got tires that will go well on the snow and ice....but they
&gt;still can't stop well on ice.
&gt;
&gt;Btw, I have towed bugs a lot with my 67 split..no problem if they tracked 
&gt;well, but stoping was the important part.

My point exactly.  Roadcow does have more ponies, but the rest is VW 
bus. Britt has towed 4.000 pound buses thousands and thousands of miles. 
 Has it broke things? Yes.  Does he get where he's going? Yes. Does he 
fall off mountains? Not so far.... That includes a trip across Colorado 
and Nebraska in a blizzard.

If one uses one's head it's doable. A Metro weighs about 1,200 pounds 
empty. A bus weighs 3-4,000 pounds. Flat tow the Metro, remember that 
it's back there and adjust your driving to suit and you'll just wear out 
your bus faster.
