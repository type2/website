Yep and yep. :-/

&gt; Next, now that the nut is removed give the end of the splines a good
&gt; bathing in penetrating oil.  Hit it several times over a couple of days.
&gt; Give it a few raps with a brass hammer around the &quot;snout&quot; each time.

Been tapping on the snout, it but didn't use the oil yet.

&gt; Ultimately, you might end up cutting the drum off of the splines.  Let's
&gt; not think about that.

Let's not.

Thanks,
Jen :-)
