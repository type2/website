&gt; A couple of things.  Get on the 'net and find every crewcab offered
&gt; for sale, what ever the year, don't limit to loaf either.
&gt; Scour newspapers for the same information.  Scour VW magazines,
&gt; Hemmings Motor News, everywhere for information.  Put it

Get a copy of the latest &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot; for proof.  The
December 1995 issue lists a 1968 VW Double Cab Pickup with a
value of from $400 (Parts Only) to $10,600 (Excellent).  Yours
must fall somewhere in that range, right?

It is a Krause Publication, 700 E. State St., Iola, WI 54990.  A
good magazine stand or book store should have one.  I comes out 4
times a year.
