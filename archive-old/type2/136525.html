Subject: Re: [T2] AC in Southern Buses

If you can have a/c in the bus, why not? if I can have
a/c its better. If u enjoy 98 degree weather combined
with 98% humidity more power to you (and to your
engine)

&gt; My first car was a 65 B**tle with Mark IV AC. 
&gt; Sucked engine power and  
&gt; took up space, so I removed it.  I was 16 years old,
&gt; living in Palm Beach  
&gt; County, FL.  Hot, muggy.  My second car was an MG
&gt; with no AC and black  
&gt; interior - same locale.  Back in 1977 we installed a
&gt; dealer DPD AC unit in  
&gt; a 71 bus, again, PB County -- but mainly for reduced
&gt; wind and road noise  
&gt; on trips.
