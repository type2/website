&gt; What's recommended for cleaning the engine: parts,

&gt; I read kerosene, gasoline, &quot;solvent&quot; (too generic a
&gt; term).  And how does one
&gt; go about eliminating the waste?
&gt; TIA
&gt; 

	For cleaning loose parts like engine tin I did a study using
orange hand cleaner (GOJO I recall), GUNK Foamy Engine Brite and 
the Ivory dish detergent I wash the outside of the car with. 
Same gungy pieces of metal, like the rear (FIF) engine mount of 
our '70, the filler pieces of 'tin' that the engine seal seals 
against, etc. I put each of the cleaners on the part per 
directions, brushed with a clean, stiff, brush (no mixing) 
and let it stand for 20 minutes. 

	Orange hand cleaner worked best by a substantial margin.
After a repeat hard-brushing and a second 20 minute soak, the
GUNK product test areas were still dirty, while the orange
hand cleaner  areas were clean and just waiting
to be rinsed. Ivory just wasn't up to it, which is why it doesn't
lift car wax either. Good for the shiny side, not for the greasy 
stuff.

	Simple Green and other products are themselves nice but
the gunge you're cleaning off, as has been pointed out, 
ISN'T OK. So you want to collect your rinse-off, let the 
particles settle and hydrocarbons float, separate both, 
and pour the remaining water INTO THE SEWER, (Via sink or 
toilet) NOT DOWN THE STORM DRAIN! Sewer water is treated,
storm drains typically run straight to the local bay/river.

	Not as hard as it sounds, I kept a big plastic garbage can
and would let things settle out in it. The sludge went to
oil recycling. Use a plastic putty knife or a pot-scraper to
remove the sludge.

	George Lyle is right as usual, connect the hose to your
hot water heater and you'll get MUCH faster rinsing, using
less water.
