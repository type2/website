The second best moment in &quot;Young Dr. Frankenstein&quot;, besides &quot;no...walk
this way!&quot; was 

&quot;IT'S ALIVE...ITS ALIIIIIVEEEEEEE!!&quot;

(In my best Southern Fried preacher Voice)&quot;Yet A-NUTHa, ENguN BORHn of
the LIE-fe blood Of the STUD-ee and KNowledge of simPUL machines!&quot;

I got me a brand new, from the crankshaft up to the manifold, from CV to
shining CV, G-E-nuine, Hooverized, blowin' 1600DP. WaHOO! -- &quot;How, many
horsepower that thing put out?&quot;--- Built, all by myself, yes I did!

I can't thank you enough.  I started reading this list ~2.5 years ago. 
I had a bus I loved and killed sitting in a barn rotting for 8 years. 
It now purrs like a kitten.  As you recall, I went through problems of
dizzy gear orientation to no oil pressure. You helped me through them
all.   I feel sometimes as though we are much closer than we are
geographically. It's great to be able to ask a question at any time and
have a response within an hour.   It's great to know that such a small,
simple, 60 som-odd year old design can bring people together from all
over the globe.  It's sad to know that's all it takes.  

I plan to write up some of my experiences from this rebuild soon, in the
hopes that more will start it.  Right after I take my first trip in my
bus loaded with friends, camping gear, guitars, canoes, dogs, tools,
etc.  (Beer, Don't forget BEER) Don't worry, It won't be long:)

She's back on the road(as of tomorrow). Ugly, but on the road.  I owe
you guys some time.....and beer.
