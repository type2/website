Just as a warning, Webasto has a terrible site that offers really lousy
information.

For the Webasto BueHeat Air Top 2000, around $1700 installed by my local
Dodge dealer and $1250 for the raw unit. They produce 7000 btu/h at full and
3100 btu/h on low setting and best of all only burn .06 gal/h at full and
.03 gal/h of fuel at low! More than enough to heat a Typ2.

I found one company online that is selling the AirTop 2000 for $836 as a
diesel model but I am pretty sure they are interchangeable. I am sure they
would honor that price for a gas model.

Below is the link for the Air Top 2000s (which is available as gasoline
powered)

Below is the link for the installation kit for the Air Top 2000s

Below is an interesting story on the engine pre-heaters and their positive
effect on pollution!

My brother is installing one in his 06 Dodge Mega Cab Cummins to preheat his
engine and cab. I am going to try and follow  that install closely, despite
the fact it is in a Diesel and he will probably have the dealer install it
for him.

&gt;&gt; I recently checked into Webasto and they definitely have gas cab heaters.
&gt;&gt; The are small and efficient. Probably going to go that route instead of a
&gt;&gt; rebuilt BN4.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; and the price is??????
