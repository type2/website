&gt; sender mounted near the #3 exhaust port?  The old sender was mounted under a
&gt; &quot;stud&quot; right above the #3 spark plug (it had been broken for nearly a year)
&gt; and it would max out at about 350.

I think what you found out here is that Exhaust Gas Temperature is quite a bit
hotter than Cylinder Head Temperature.  Based upon the location you are picking
up the reading from.  CHT measures the heat of the head at a surface at least 0.5
to 0.75 inch away from the actual combustion process.  The heat in the center of
that chamber is much higher during combustion.  Immediately after ignition, the
temperature increases very rapidly and may reach 5500 degrees F.  Likewise, the
exhaust gas is much hotter than the cylinder and head surfaces.  The temp drops
rapidly as it moves to the outer surfaces, where the reading is usually taken.

What is your reading under a hard climb?
