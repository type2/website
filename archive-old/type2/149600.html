Subject: RE: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

     Welding is really easy to learn to do, but really hard to learn to do 
well :-)  I tought myself completely, at first.  It took me a few minutes to 
get to the point where I could reliably stick thick metal (about 1/8&quot;) 
together in a rather ugly but plenty strong way.  After about an hour my 
welds on thick metal looked really nice, like little disks all laid out on 
top of each other kind of like a bead of caulk.
     That thick stuff is all pretty easy though, it's the thin sheet metal 
that's hard.  After several hours of practice with it I can now get shet 
metal pieces together well enough for body work with a light skim coat of 
body filler.  At least I think I can :-)  Spot welding by laying one piece 
of sheet metal over the other, drilling just through the top piece, and then 
welding the two together by sort of plugging that hole isn't too hard.  
Welding sheet metal end to end, which is the best way for some repairs, is 
pretty hard to do without warping the metal or burning through.
     Overall, it's tricky but far from beyond most folks.  Sort of a mixture 
of technical, mechanical, and artistic skills.  It's not at all impossible 
though, and in my opinion it's been allot of fun and well worth the effort.  
I think anybody with reasonable sense and ability aught to be able to pick 
it up on their own.  That said, it's also probably worth investing in an 
instructional video, a couple of books, or maybe even a class at the local 
college if you want faster returns.

     If you want to learn a little quicker and not spend the money or time 
for a full class, maybe go to your local welders shop.  Talk to some of the 
welders there and ask if they'd be interested in getting a $50 and half a 
six pack for an hour or two of their weekend time :-)
