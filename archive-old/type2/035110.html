Subject: very cold

We just got a lot of snow here in IL and its very cold.  This morning I 
started my bus and it was running fine for about 5 min. while I let it warm 
up, and then when I got in it just died.  It started back up, but if I didn't 
give it a lot of gas on my way to school it would die.  Is it just because 
its sooo cold, or do you think its more than just the cold thats my problem?  
Thanks.
