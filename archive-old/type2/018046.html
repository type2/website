Subject: Oil leaking (not any more) out of my 1700cc flat T4 engine.

Dear friends:

Did the job  this past Saturday.   It wasn't really difficult,  plenty
of work but very easy.    For good sake, the cooler was not broken but
one of the seals was cracked (the lower one).   Also, I found out that
two of the fan blades were broken,  fortunately  I  have a complete
similar engine as  spare  and the fan was ok and replaced it.

I would like to give personal thanks to:  David Schwarze,   Sean
Bantnik   and  A.Brandy Psmythe  for their posts.   &quot;You guys gave me a
good picture on how to start,  thanks for the help&quot;.

I took out some pictures of the labour and hope to scan them soon and
see if I can put them in the internet so any newee ( like me) as same as
others that have never done this job before,  could have something
additional of what manuals can offer.

Also,  took advantage of the time and installed a whole new electrical
fuel pump.  I had real hard times with the old mechanical one.  After
being in idle for more than 10 minutes in traffic, the engine use to
stop and it was very difficult to start it up again.  Thanks god that's
over !!.

In other order of ideas, I'm planing to do on the second week of next
August,   a 1,800 Km (+/-)  trip  from Caracas to Puerto Ayacucho
(Capital city of the Amazonas state at the South border with Colombia).
There, along with my father, brother and brother in law, are planing to
do rafting on the Orinoco river rapids.   Will also take some pictures
and share them with you good folks.

Once again thanks for your help and support.

Best regards to all.

Yours,
Pedro Vivas/
