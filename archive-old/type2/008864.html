&gt; Volks, My heat exchangers are looking a little shabby, and that old,
&gt; hey
&gt; is that a harley? noise is chugging out of the back of the bus. Its
&gt; Fairly
&gt; Warm down here in OZ most of the time and given that my last Bus had
&gt; 0
&gt; heating fixture (removed by PO). I was wondering if I really want to
&gt; spend
&gt; the money on new heat exchangers *BUT* is there an alternative ????
&gt; Or any
&gt; suggested repair techniques much appreciated (they are a bit rusty
&gt; around
&gt; the header which attaches to the muffler.

I had the same problem on my 70. I pulled the HE's and welded them. I
brazed part and welded part. Now they are air tight( I went a little
overboard). I would only sugest this if you have lots of time and are
skiled with a welder. I spent about two hours. Good Luck
