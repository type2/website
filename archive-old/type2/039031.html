Well, I took my 79 bus out for her first drive yesterday I put new heater 
boxes and muffler system on it, the old was completly rotted and full of big 
holes.  Is there supposed to be some kind of tin over the heads?  Well she 
ran great for about a half hour and suddenly cut out and died, I turned the 
key and got nothing the battery was completly dead, luckly I was on a hill, 
I poped the clutch and jumped it, it started but ran horribly it was bucking 
and backfiring and keeped stalling out on me. so I get it back home and put 
the battery on a charger and charged it for a few hours.  It fired right up 
and ran great again, I only drove it for about 5 min.  So I tried it this 
morning and the battery was completly dead, its a brand new battery by the 
way.  So, the only thing I can guess is its my altenator not putting out 
enough juice and draining the battery.  any advice?
