Subject: Home made Poptop canvas

Anyone out there ever try to make your own poptop canvas for a 68-73 Westy?  I
have a bunch of old Eureka Timberline Tents in my garage (one perk of running
Summer Camps for the past 7 years) and a sewing machine.  These are quality
nylon tents, well they were, they have miscellaneous holes and broken zippers
now. But my concern is the size of the fabric panels needed for the poptop
canvas. Does anyone one know approximately how big the LARGEST panel of the
poptop would need to be?
I don't want to rip out my old canvas only to find that the tents are not big
enough to sew a replacement.


Peace, John Baker
