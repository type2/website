Subject: [T2] transmission question: hard to get into first

hi all. i'm having an annoying problem with my '77 westy.
it is really difficult to get the transmission into first
gear. it requires a lot of feeling around and a fair amount
of force to get it in. this is sometimes embarrasing at
stop signs when i'm sitting there wrestiling with the
shifter. i have this problem regardless of whether i'm
stopped or rolling. second gear is also a little difficult
to get into, but it &quot;snaps&quot; into place much easier than
first. third and fourth have no problems at all. does
anyone know what these symptoms indicate? since it's both
first and second, might there be a problem with one of the
synchros? or could this be an issue with the shift rods
being out of whack? please don't tell me i have to have the
tranny rebuilt.

cheers,
ben
