Subject: Re: [T2] 'We're Missing the Funkiness' Can VW Finally Find Its 
  Way In America - Internat

I agree- We looked at the Toureg (a heavy &quot;tank&quot;) and wanting a 4WD, 
bought a Subaru Forester for $24,000- liked the low horizontally apposed 
engine- sorry, VW!
Shoulda launched the Mew Microbus!  My daughter (the next generation, 
has a 75 bus) is sad they did not..........VW is not listening to its 
dealers

&quot;Dealers think VW blew a golden opportunity when it chose not to 
introduce an updated version of the wildly popular Microbus from the 
'60s and '70s. Instead, the company is launching a repackaged, 
Volkswagen-branded, Chrysler minivan. Casey Gunther, VW's top-selling 
U.S. dealer, in Coconut Creek, Fla., is worried. &quot;We're missing the 
funkiness&quot; that U.S. buyers expect from VW, he says. &quot;The Germans don't 
understand.&quot; And unlike in Europe, affluent buyers don't see VW as an 
aspirational brand.&quot;

   I live in a yuppie bedroom community with
  thousands of young adults whose pockets are just bulging with disposable
  income.  A couple of months after VW launched its &quot;New Rabbit&quot; our VW
  dealer closed.  They said that they had only sold four cars in the
  previous two months.  The space is a lot more profitable now as the
  used-car branch of the adjacent Nissan dealership.  If a VW dealership
  cannot survive in yuppieville, VW is doomed in the US.

Other than the New Beetle, what does VW offer to draw customers?  The
  &quot;quirky little car&quot; market is already satisfied by the Mini and Scion xB.
  A rebadged Chrysler minivan will hardly draw customers when the same
  vehicle can be had cheaper down the street at the Chrysler dealer.
