Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news

Before you get all high and mighty and start judging others... consider the fact that your Volkswagen Bus is not only polluting the environment at a significantly higher amount than a typical SUV, but you more than likely also get worse or similar fuel economy to some of the most massive SUV's available on the road today.

And before you go worrying about what we do in the United States, you should try being more concerned with what's going on in your own country first.

Don't take this in a bad way... you guys are always more than welcome to come visit any time you want to in South Florida.... just stop wearing the spandex / speedo bathingsuits on our beaches... they just weren't meant for 45 year old men.  (If you wouldn't mind spreading the word... I'd REALLY appreciate it)

&gt;Then I guess ... people are ... hmmm - better not use the 'f' word. But what 
&gt;it is with the SUV guys - I just can't imagine driving one of those things - 
&gt;$40 K to buy - less than 20 mpg - more often than not there is only one 
&gt;person driving it - There is something about being human that makes the 
&gt;majority of people want to make payments on an SUV and live in a 5K square 
&gt;foot house .. for reasons I just can't put my finger on .. but then ... 
&gt;folks voted for W and I can't figure that out either.
