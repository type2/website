Subject: fire extinguishers

Your friendly list fire protection systems designer loves chiming in
on these threads.

The Fireade looks like what we call A triple F, Aqueous Film Forming
Foam.  The stuff they spray at the airports.  The foam sits on top of
liquid fuel, creating a barrier between the fuel and the fire.  Mixed
with water at varying percentages based on the expected hazard.

It won't damage your engine, but it will leave residue.

For anyone still running the magnesium case engines, this stuff is not
listed for that application (Class D fires).  The magnesium alloy
supplies it's own oxygen to the fire, so CO2 or clean agents (halon,
inert gases) are the only thing to fully extinguish them.  Halon is an
ozone-depleting gas and is not used in new applications in the
industry any longer.

Clean agents work by displacing oxygen, so we typically use them in
hazards that can be sealed (total flooding).  CO2 is more appropriate
for open environments and directed directly at the fire (local
application).

It's not listed for Class C (electrical fires) but that category only
includes higher voltages (120 or 240 AC and above) so it is acceptable
for use on an energized 12VDC system.

&gt; I wonder what this stuff is---??
&gt; Your supposed to mix it in an extinquisher bottle?
&gt;
&gt; I know halon is the best for putting a fire out right now without really
&gt; screwing up the surrounding area, but some of the green people don't
&gt; seem to care for it.
&gt;
&gt; Halon rob's the oxygen from the fire-- POOF-- it's out right now and
&gt; doesn't make any kind of a mess of anything that wasn't burning.
