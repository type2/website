Subject: Re: [T2] Holy Batman!!...spam concerning VWOA TM licensing

Glad I have 72camper and not VW camper or something. I won't have to accept
anything they want VW people  to do!

At least they are trying somewhat, but I am weary of a trap. Agreeing they
own part of your website, etc. and giving them the go ahead to monitor your
site doesn't sound good.Of course the hardest hit people are still not
helped. Its kind of hard to sell stuff when your domain is Joesstuff_dot_com
because you can't put VW in it.

You won't see &quot;officially liscensed by VWAG&quot; on my site and I am proud of
that!!

&gt; Subject: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!
&gt;
&gt; This e-mail address has been identified as belonging to a Volkswagen Club
&gt; or Enthusiast and Volkswagen in the United States and Canada has some
&gt; great news we would like to share with you.
&gt;
&gt; As you may have heard, Volkswagen of America, Inc. and Volkswagen Canada
&gt; Inc. are endeavoring to break into a new arena of licensing!  In just a
&gt; few weeks, we will announce the formation of our Trademark Internet
&gt; Licensing Program for Volkswagen vehicle enthusiasts and clubs in the
&gt; United States and Canada.  Visit us online at
&gt; http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt; -An Enthusiast: Any individual desiring to promote their interest in
&gt; Volkswagen products, the company and its heritage on a website in a NON-
&gt; COMMERCIAL manner.
&gt;
&gt; -A Club:  Any NON-COMMERCIAL organization that has its primary objective
&gt; a sharing of interests in Volkswagen products, the company and its
&gt; heritage on a website, in newsletters, at meetings and events in a NON-
&gt; COMMERCIAL manner.
&gt;
&gt; -NON-COMMERCIAL:  Having no functionality to allow for revenue to be
&gt; generated at the site including, but not limited to, commercial links,
&gt; advertising of any kind, and shopping carts.
&gt;
&gt; Why do we need to do this?
&gt;
&gt; Volkswagen of America, Inc. (&quot;VWoA&quot;) and Volkswagen Canada Inc. (&quot;VWC&quot;)
&gt; are the exclusive US and Canadian importers of cars manufactured by
&gt; Volkswagen AG (&quot;VWAG&quot;) and are responsible for protecting trademarks
&gt; associated with those cars. The Volkswagen logo; &quot;VW;&quot; the
&gt; words &quot;Volkswagen;&quot; &quot;Beetle,&quot; &quot;New Beetle,&quot; &quot;Bug,&quot; all other Volkswagen
&gt; vehicle names; the New Beetle logo and the Volkswagen advertising slogans
&gt; (such as &quot;Drivers wanted&quot;) are all registered trademarks or service
&gt; marks. (This is only a partial list - we didn't want to bore you right
&gt; off.)  None of these items may be used without the express written
&gt; consent of VWoA or VWC in the U.S. and Canada. (What you may use in other
&gt; places depends on the laws of that country.)  If a trademark owner fails
&gt; to protect its rights to its trademarks, it risks losing those rights.
&gt; Did you know that &quot;escalator&quot; was once a registered trademark?  And so
&gt; were &quot;aspirin&quot;, &quot;trampoline&quot;, &quot;refrigerator&quot;, &quot;yo yo&quot; and many more!  But
&gt; they failed to take precautions that would have helped them have a long
&gt; and prosperous life as registered trademarks.
&gt;
&gt; You may want to take a look at our Trademark Enforcement Program Policy
&gt; Statement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/policy.html)  and our
&gt; Trademark Usage Guide (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/usage.html) which
&gt; both include more information regarding our need for this program and
&gt; offer guidance with respect to the proper use of our trademarks.
&gt;
&gt; What will a license involve?
&gt;
&gt; Use of any VWAG, VWoA or VWC trademarks is restricted to certain types of
&gt; use, more clearly outlined in our General Terms and Conditions
&gt; (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/gtc.html), and requires our written
&gt; permission in the form of a legal agreement, the Draft Club Limited
&gt; Trademark License Agreement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/club.html)
&gt; or the Draft Enthusiast Limited Trademark License Agreement
&gt; (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/ent.html). (These are the U.S.
&gt; documents, but the Canadian documents will be basically the same.)
&gt; These legally binding documents will grant legal permission to
&gt; enthusiasts or clubs to utilize our trademarks in a manner which does not
&gt; infringe upon our trademarks or is not counter to our brand image.
&gt; In order to comply with applicable trademark licensing laws, these
&gt; License Agreements will be continuously monitored to insure their terms
&gt; have not been violated.
&gt;
&gt; Your job.
&gt;
&gt; If you think you may be interested in being a part of our licensed
&gt; family, now is your time to preview our documents and provide your
&gt; opinion prior to the launch of the program.  Now, although we will read
&gt; through all the comments we may receive, you must understand that we may
&gt; not be able to implement every suggestion.  We will, however, do our best
&gt; to make this program as user friendly and acceptable as we can!   Just
&gt; click here (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/feedback.asp) to send us
&gt; your thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your time and interest in our products!
