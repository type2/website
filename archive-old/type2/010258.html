Subject: Needed: Starter/Solenoid '78 MT

My problem:  when I start the car in this cooler weather we are having in 
Northern Virginia, the starter does not disengage, even after the engine 
catches and is running.  (Fuel Injection)

Following the suggestion of fellow list member, I removed my 
starter/solenoid from my Manual Transmission, and cleaned up my solenoid.  
It was pretty clean to start with.

No joy.  When I started my Westy up this AM, it went into the &quot;keep on 
turning the motor over, even though the ignition key is turned OFF&quot; mode.  
Yes, I changed my ignition switch last year.  Then the weather got warmer, 
and my problem went underground.

Yes, it does stop turning over, but only after about 3-10 seconds.  This 
cannot be helping things.  Meanwhile, the engine ALWAYS catches on the third 
revolution, no mater how cold/hot

This started last winter, and got a little better after I whacked the 
STARTER a couple of time with a hammer (slight taps; difficult to get a 
clear shot at the starter with the rear axle in the way.)

The parts of the starter which I saw were fine; no burrs or rust or 
corrosion.

I am looking for a mighty fine starter/solenoid '78 MT to change out.

I do have an EXCELLENT, almost LIKE NEW '77 AUTOMATIC starter/solenoid which 
I would be willing to trade (Bob, do you remember??) for a MT setup.  Or 
sell, for a less than comparable MT setup.

People say that the '77 AT starter will fit some of the earlier buses, BTW.  
And is is a more powerful looking starter (Bosch) than my MT starter.

In Northern Virginia, I am
