Pictures please!  I'd love to see what a 8-13 thousand dollar bus looks
like!  I could put them on my wall for inspiration!

TIA!

&gt; Sure have. My old ' 78 Westy sold for 8200.00 last year. It was 99.9%
&gt; restored, (and I won't even tell you how much money I actually had in it,
&gt; excluding my own labor...) The present ' 78 that I own would go for more
than
&gt; that, IF I had a mind to sell it, which I will do only if hell freezes
over.
&gt; It is insured for an agreed apon value of 12500.00, and not a week goes by
&gt; when I don't have someone offer me 9000.00+ for it. What a change from 10
&gt; years ago, eh? ( keep in mind that these are East Coast busses...Don't see
&gt; too many of 'em in perfect shape on this side of the Mississippi!)
