Well &quot;chat room&quot; has some cheezy baggage attached to it but......

Type2_dot_com maintains an Internet Relay Chat(IRC) host at type2.irc_dot_com .
There are usually some folks in there from 8 to 11 pm eastern time.

If you are unsure what IRC is or how it works go to you favorite search
engine are just type in IRC. If you do not have the client software you can
download shareware. Just do an search with your internet browser for &quot;IRC
software download.&quot;

Mac users can use Ircle and I think the windows people use something called
MIRC. 

If you are an AOL user there is some trick to using IRC but it will work if
you futz around with it!!!!
