Subject: Re: [T2] Is there an alternative to a BN4?

I have a Propex heater in my bus.  The PO installed it under the rear
seat and drilled two 1&quot; holes directly under for exhaust and venting(?).
The existing propane  line to the stove is tee'd and a separate feed is
sent to the
heater.  I'm real happy with it.

&gt;  Is there another
&gt; option, besides the BN4, that has been used and found to be effective,
&gt; reasonable priced, safe, and otherwise worth considering. Perhaps one
&gt; that burns propane?
