Hi all,
    I'm presently working on a 79 bus, trying to get it back on the road.
One problem is that the battery tray is completely rusted out.  I'm thinking
of moving the battery to the left side of the engine compartment.  I'd
replace the current battery+  cable with a longer one that would reach the
new location in as short a run as practical and move the negative cable over
to the left as well.  Then I'd use some thin sheetmetal to close up the
whole.
    Have any of you ever done this ?  I'm wondering what problems to expect.

                    thanks volks,
                    Paul
