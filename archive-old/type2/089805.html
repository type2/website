Subject: Interiors for a 78 Westy

I hopefully pick up my 78 westy on Wednesday and have been looking around for 
replacement parts and all that but had a question about interiors offered on 
the 78s.

Most the pics I've come across show the sink/cooler and small rear closet 
along the driver's side.  The bus I'm buying has the closet on the passenger 
side (major blind spot creator when I was test driving) that takes up the 
whole side up to the sliding door and then the rear bench goes to the drivers 
wall.  From what I've seen this setup was common on the early 70 bays.  Was 
this available on the later 70's buses or have I found one that's had it's 
interior replaced - which doesn't really matter to me since I'm gonna replace 
it with the other version anyway...but curious if it was available, or how 
many layouts were available.

The other thing I noticed is the passenger seat doesn't spin around to face 
back...was that an option or standard?  Thinking maybe that was a replacement 
seat - or makes me think the interior is original because with the closet on 
the passenger side, isn't there usually a cabinet that goes behind the 
passenger seat with a seat and table behind the driver?

Can't believe, don't even own the bus yet and already have spent $100 on 
replacement parts I noticed that needed fixing, already picked out a few more 
parts I want from the catalogs I've recieved and have been running around 
checking out local campgrounds in the area.

BTW...are there any bus gatherings located in the Virginia/Maryland area?  I 
can't wait to put the bus to use once I get it!
