&gt; The bus is a 1967 model with correct 14&quot; rims and a stock 10.6 gallon tank. Tire size is 14R185/70.

&gt; That is about all the bus content for the post so you may want to delete now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From time to time the issue of gas mileage in an old bus comes up on the list. I must confess that I have been a bad bus driver and never carefully calculated my MPG. Recently I thought it would be interesting to pinpoint MPG in order to see how effective my tune-ups are.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to be accurate there are some issues that must be addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Exactly how much gas am I using? Assuming the gas pump is ACCURATELY telling me how much I have pumped I can start there. I filled up the bus to a notable point in the filler neck and noted the odometer reading. Upon my next fill up (which I hope will be in about 250 statute miles) I will fill up to the same point noting amount put in the tank and current odometer reading. A little math and I have my MPG, right?

You can be pretty sure that the pump reading is accurate, as they are
usually calibrated by a weights and measures agency.  As with all
measurements, your accuracy goes up with increased quantity, so go most of
the way through the tank.
 
&gt; 2) Is my odometer reading true? I don't think so. I am currently running 14/185/70 which is undersized in comparison to the original tires to which I assume the odometer/speedometer is calculated. I do not know how to correct for tire size. Is there a simple factor I can plug in? 

You can be pretty sure that your odometer reading is _inaccurate_!

To calibrate your odometer, you need a 10-mile stretch of road that has
mile markers.  Note your odometer reading, drive the 10 mile stretch.
Note the odometer reading again and subtract the two readings.  Take the
difference and divide 10 by it.

This is your multiplier.  Simply multiply the distance driven on your
odometer by the multiplier to get true distance.
