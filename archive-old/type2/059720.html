David, I was playing around with 009/single vac/dual vac dizzies on our 78
loaf last spring and had pretty good luck with switching them. I'm kinda
anal about comparisons, and after reading 79 or so conflicting messages on
the subject, made the switch several dozen times. First time a
white-knuckler for fear of dropping the washers, old hat after about the
tenth. One occassion only..dizzy wouldn't reseat...posted to Karl Von S, in
a panic as usual, and he has me take a long skinny screwdriver, gently move
the washer back to center, and drop the dizzy in. I don't do this for fun
anymore, but I run the electronic rig now, and do carry the others as
backup. I think the practice I've had, admittedly excessive, willl make me
comfortable with a change on the road, even.
Regards, Marv Krupp..with this weeks goals of retrieving our long abandoned
63 1500 notch, and starting up the new 68 crewcab!
