Subject: Re: [T2] Brake adjusting star clip replacement

Jerry,

I've heard of people making them out of the metal banding that comes 
around things strapped to crates and pallets.

Never tried it myself tho.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
 Does anyone have advice on fabricating one of the spring steel clips 
 that keep the adjusting star from backing off (1970, rear)?  One side 
 of one of my clips has broken off.  The guy at the parts store 
&gt; recommended that I simply knurl the barrel a little to hold the star in 
&gt; place, but that seems tenuous at best.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
