Subject: aux battery relay/solenoid/isolator

I saw this product mentioned on the vanagon-list.  I like the idea of 
waiting until my main battery is full before I charge my aux:

I am planning on purchasing the 1315 model.

I have a Hella relay kit currently, no pun intended. Since I have no alt 
idiot light (motorola beetle alternator retrofit), I installed a manual 
switch for the relay connecting the batteries (kept the long thin wire 
for lower current draw).  However, if the aux is really low it drains 
the main and/or blows the fuse.

Comments welcome.
