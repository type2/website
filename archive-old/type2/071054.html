I have found that the operator of my bus (me) tends to have higher blood 
temperatures and pressures when operating the bus in the company of other 
vehicles: people who get p*ssed off when I don't go 0 to 50 in 4 seconds 
when the light turns green, and who so indicate by passing me on the 
right in a burst of speed. 

(I'm just guessing that my blood temp rises, having declined to install a 
temperature guage in either my dipstick or my sump while driving).

So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and 
pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.

i dont take i too seriously, well i think it is fun to make people mad, i make
a game out of it, i go very slow along roads that many people speed through.
so!, alot of people get mad at me, but usally i am in the bigger car, they
just give me some funny hand gesture, and i wave and say 'hi'.

so....i dont and neither should you or anybody else take it persoanlly when
someone passes you at a high  rate of speed. or gives you the finger. just
wave like i do.


heres the buscontent/my engine problem

it is hard to start my 72 bus right away, it takes alot of time sitting there
on the accelerator getting it to idle. is this normal? when i pump the pedal
and start it it dies right away without my full attention.
....anyways , i know that the points are shot, so can someone tell me how to
replace them i cant find the post on the archives

is this symptioms of my points dieing?
