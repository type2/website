Just to re-cap. I have asked this question before and I am still having =
some problems.
Okay, my 1970 type II bus has a problem shifting to one gear to the =
next. As of know I can shift it from 3rd to 4th. I can not get it in 1st =
2nd or reverse. I was told to change the Bushing on the shift rod.
I bought the complete guide for idiots, and I am unable to find this =
info. in the book. I need to know if I change the busing and the =
coupling will this correct my problem? The transmission seems fine it =
runs good in 3rd and fourth. Also where are these bushings supposed to =
be, I can only find the rubber boot looking things near the coupling. =
Where do these little white plastic things go and are they easy to =
install?
