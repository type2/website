&gt; &gt; And as for fixing the seats remember that they were cheap to begin with
&gt; &gt; otherwise if they had put Recaros in there they wouldn't have been able

&gt; Inexpensive yes but I wouldn't call them cheap. After installing the
horse hair repro cushions from WW, I've been able to drive 750 mile, 13
hr. days with ZERO leg/back fatigue. VW designed those seats just right
and all they need is a little rebuild if the cushions have disintegrated.

I recall an interesting quote in a VW history book.  VW was contemplating
opening a factory in the US to build aircooled bugs.  They sought out
suppliers for various components.  One seat manufacturer declined to bid
on building seats to the VW design, stating &quot;You guys don't have seats in
your cars, you have *furniture*!&quot;

I agree that a properly rebuilt VW seat is very comfy.  I used foam in
place of horsehair, but the thing that really makes it nice is the springs
underneath.  They provide far better suspension than any other seats I've
had.
