Subject: Brake Bleeding??
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Everyone...well I just completed my first mastercylinder 
removal/installation and now I am ready to bleed the brakes..however...when I 
fill up the brake fluid resevoir....the brake fluid seems to squeeze out of 
the top of my mastercylinder...where the two nipples go into the top of the 
master cylinder..thus losing all the brake fluid I poured in...I am a bit 
confused...if someone could give some advice that would be great...Thanks 
alot..Adam
