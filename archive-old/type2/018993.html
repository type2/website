One easy thing you might try before tearing into the ignition
switch/lock would be to remove the ignition switch wire where it
connects to the solenoid, clean off the contacts with a small wire brush
and see if that clears the problem up. When this contact becomes
oxidized or dirty it can drop the voltage going into the solenoid from
12 volts to 6-7 volts. The marginal voltage can give exactly the same
symptoms as you describe. This problem seems to crop up periodically
with my '71.
