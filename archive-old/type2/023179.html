&gt;Bob,

&gt;thanks for posting the picture on your website. I'm wondering how/if the
&gt;console is mounted to the floor? Also, I couldn't see from the picture where
&gt;your radio was.
=================================&gt;
The center consoles just set on the floors.
No need ever found to attach it to anything.
It does not vibrate around, nor has it ever been jarred from where it has 
been placed.

Currently, the radio is mounted to the console that is in Casper, patiently 
awaiting our departure out West in a few weeks, so it was not shown in the 
NewBus console picture I referenced.

Here are a couple of very fast pictures showing the radio body bolted to 
the console in Casper, as well as the radio control head mounted to the 
dash board ash tray.

Sorry for picture quality, but I just ran out and snapped them real quick 
for you.

Setting the console on the floor backwards gave me better access to the cup 
holders, and made available a flat surface for bolting on the radio body.
It worked out pretty cool, as opposed to the larger one I had in there that 
required gymnastics to get beyond when Mary Beth was assigned brewsky 
retrieval for the pilot.
