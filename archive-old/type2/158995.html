Subject: Re: [T2] adhesive panel repairs?

Nah, I moved to Italy just in the nick of time... 100 mph in a VW rabbit 
for 150 miles to Rome from time to time, 75 mph drafting CLOSE off of a 
Mercedes on the autostrada with a BMW tight on my tail coming back from 
San Vito near Bari (Southeast Italia). Only 1 lane due to Jersey bumpers 
(?) closing the fast lane.  It was the fastest my little 40 HP Super 
Beetle had gone for so long... Airborne over the crossroads near my 
house in a Renault Clio... Airbone in a Fiat Panaroma and Fiat Ducato... 
Airborne in a Rabbit 'vert (6 inchesm did not even bottom out the 
suspension). Blowing through a tollboth responding to an accident with 
injuries (I'LL NEVER rush through a tollboth again with or without 
lights and sirens - too many BAD things could have happened!!!). Ever 
seen Ronin? We did something like that one night in an Opel Kadett 2.0 
one night responding to a BAD, bad accident between a pedestrian and a 
vehicle. I'll never drive like that again either if I can help.

Just about the time I was getting &quot;wiser&quot; I transferred back to the USA.

No Italians were harmed during this period of stupid behavior...
