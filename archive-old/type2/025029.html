I would have to vote for the 78 bus. It has the 2 liter engine with fuel 
injection and hydraulic lifters, and the 49 state versions don't have 
the catalytic converters, so the exhaust plumbing is simpler to 
maintain. The fact that I have put 240,000 enjoyable and reliable 
miles on mine might be influencing my choice, though. Now, if I 
could find a good front beam to replace the one that's beginning to 
rust out on the drivers side, I could put some more miles on it.
