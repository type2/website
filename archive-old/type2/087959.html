Subject: Re: [T2] Was: Being Sued by VWoA

&gt; Speaking to some other people, it sounds like Continental is just trying
to
&gt; score easy money by using scare tactics on people. I haven't heard from
&gt; anyone that Continental has does anything more than sent threatening
letters
&gt; to people. Anything more than a letter would probably constitute more time
&gt; and money than they care to invest. Sad thing is, I bet they've made quite
a
&gt; bit of money from this operation.

If they operate like some of the other law firms do, they might figure that
the quicker you capitulate and give in, the more they can push you and the
more likely you will give them even more money on another filing or threat.
Tossing marshmellows to them may only serve as encouragement.  Jan B
