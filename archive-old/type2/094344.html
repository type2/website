Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

Here's a view from the other perspective:

My current next door neighbors have 6, count'em - SIX - un-registered cars
in their backyard. Some run, some don=B9t and at least one is sinking
(literally) into the ground. They're stacked in there tight and all that
separates me from them is a 4' high chainlink fence and the weeds that they
refuse to cut.

It sucks living within spitting distance of a junkyard for two years and
last week the city got a polite call asking if they could reduce the count =
a
bit. I will say that they have never blinked twice about the Vanagons and
Busses that I've parted out beside my house, but they were parted in a
matter of days. Not years.
