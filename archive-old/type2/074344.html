Subject: juicy butt fart story

    Once upon a time, there was a juicy butt fart. He was the juiciest butt
fart in all the colon. He dreamed of someday being the juiciest butt fart
the world had ever known. He helped little old ladies cross the street, he
would run into burning buildings and rescue people, and he even read to the
blind on Sundays. He was a good juicy butt fart. His mother always told him,
&quot;You be good, and nothing can stop you from being the juiciest butt fart in
the world.&quot; Nearby in a large piece of corn, there lived a evil carbunkle
named Evil Carbunkle, the evillest carbunkle in the colon. He hated the
juicy butt fart with all his soul. He knew the juicy butt fart needed to be
taken down a peg or two. He would try to out do the juicy butt fart with his
own juicy butt farts. But, alas, his butt farts were never quite juicy
enough. Finally, when word of the juicy butt fart's plans of introducing
himself to the world emerged, Evil Carbunkle concocted a plan to stop the
juicy butt fart. Evil Carbunkle gathered all the cheese, bread dough, and
pasta that he could find in all the tracts of Digestion he could find. He
made a huge beaver dam like butt plug and placed it over the anus. He
laughed maniacally, because as all Carbunkle's before him they laughed this
way too. He hid behind a piece of celery nearby and waited. Along came the
juicy butt fart, occassionally shining the silver buckles on his patent
leather shoes. He stopped with a start, much easier than starting with a
stop, at the sight of the large butt plug. Then he shrugged, split into a
thousand little juicy butt farts, with shiny silver buckled shoes and all,
and they crawled around the butt plug's edges. Rejoining on the other side
of the plug, they rejoiced before joining back into the single juicy butt
fart. &quot;Curses, foiled again!&quot;, yelled Evil Carbunkle. The juicy butt fart
ran out of the butthole and soon became the juiciest butt fart in the world.
But that's another juicy butt fart story...

Moral: No matter how hard you try, sometimes you just can't keep back a good
juicy butt fart.

PLEASE TAKE ME OFF THIS FRIGGIN' MAILER. APPARENTLY THE UNSUBSCRIBE THING
DOES NOT WORK!
