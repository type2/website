&quot;Conventional Wisdom&quot; strikes again.  Change your driving habits, change your
carb, change your gear ratios, change your vehicle.  The 009 is an acceptable
distributor in your dragster 2180 bug.  It is not an acceptable distributor in
a 1600 bus.  Straight mechanical advance causes flat spots, lousy mileage.  If
you can change all of the above, it'll work just fine.  If you want to drive a
1600 bus, change your distributor.  A 205 works well.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine. Although it
&gt; &gt; &gt;seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable when cold due
&gt; &gt; &gt;to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each gear.  I was
&gt; &gt; &gt;told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a new 009
&gt; &gt; &gt;distributor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This dizzy/carb combo is legendary for this. Best is to lose the 009 and get
&gt; &gt; a real dizzy. One with a vacuum advance. Alternately you can adjust the carb
&gt; &gt; to the point that you will get lousy fuel economy and it will run nearly
&gt; &gt; okay.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree. Stick with the 009 its a superior distributor. You don't want to
&gt; have to rely on a vacum advance distributor.
&gt; They're ancient. When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a dead stop upon
&gt; shift up through the gears.
&gt; Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch with the
&gt; gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother.
&gt; By the way, the 34.3 is a mediocre carb on its best day fresh out of the box,
&gt; so you might consider switching to a 30pict1
&gt; and an adaptor plate, this will also help your dead spot.
