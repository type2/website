Subject: Request for data from owners manuals

Hi, All.

I'm working on a comprehensive post regarding tires. I'm hoping to put to
rest the issues regarding load rating, et. al.

I'd like to hear from people who have different year owner's manuals. If I
can gather all the information, I'll put together one comprehensive post
compiling VW's tire specifications for the different years (I promise, it'll
be short!).

Please p-mail me off list.

Please include the year and all the information from the WEIGHTS section of
the TECHNICAL DATA chapter in the owners manual, Unladen Weight through
Gross Axle Weight Rear for each model. English units are fine; no need to
include the metrics.

I have the data from 1979, 1978 and 1977 already (thanks, Bob).

Thanks, All.
