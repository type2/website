Subject: Urgent Appeal

Dear Folks,

If you know *for sure* who's got the Bus Tour hubcap, please ask them to get
in touch with me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net . Better yet, if *you* have the
hubcap please let me know so I can set up the new web page.

For everyone who has had the hubcap and has not yet done a trip report,
please do so and publish it along with any photos you may have or send them
along to me and I'll put them up on the web page. Everyone's dying to know
what's been happening to the hubcap!

TIA, especially to the list gods who have been particularly understanding!

Chris and Gus the &quot;That hubcap is so slippery it must have grease on it!&quot;
