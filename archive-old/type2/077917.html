Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] Driving with sliding door open, is it legal?]


When the doors are shut, they are firmly wedged into place and supported
at many points around their perimeters.  When open they are only supported
at 2 or three points which are not designed for the dynamic loading of a
moving vehicle.  I'd hate to be in a minor front-ender with the sliding
door open.  That little latch would tear out in a heartbeat!
