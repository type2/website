X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Well, it appears that the upper end of the engine in; this 75 Westy is 
crrrrrap! I wish I'd checked the pistons and cylinders carefully before 
cleaning, honing, and painting them :-( 

Ah, well, she'll be better for new ones anyway. I can't stand the notion of 
putting these back in when they vary up to .005 in diameter among the set. We 
are learning more about the dopey PO.

I do have a question. The clutch shaft isn't solid in the gearbox. I can 
grasp the end of the shaft that goes into the pilot bearing (the shaft is 
hanging in the air, as the tranny is split off the engine) and move it +- 
1/8&quot; in any direction radially. Is this per design?
