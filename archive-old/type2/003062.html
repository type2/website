Howdy folks. More info on the Tour's progress is up on the website,
including photos provided by  Messrs. Dolan and Bartnik.

This weekend, the Tour will be heading west toward Roanoke, then into
Tennessee. From there it will head south to Georgia, and back through the NW
tip of S. Carolina and into N. Carolina.

If you're in these areas and want to participate, make your way over to the
website and sign up.

Thanks to all who have participated thus far, and for those to come!
