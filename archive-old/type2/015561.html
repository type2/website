Last I heard they were available they were BigDangedBucks. That was some 2
or more years ago. Now they are not available at any price, unless you get
lucky, which you might on this list. Do check with Nikki. Perhaps she has
or can find a used one not shot through with rust.

Aftermarket is easy to buy, sometimes a bear to install, sometimes
uninstallable (stay away from Wagner products sold through NAPA, fer sur)
but won't last nearly as long as those original pipes. On the wet side of
Worshington, most last over 20 years. The original on mine was 28 last
February.
