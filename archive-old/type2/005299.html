Hi,

Last call for Busses and Bluegrass. This weekend at Hagan-Stone park in
beautiful Pleasant Garden, North Carolina. The local bluegrass and folk
music crowd will be hosting the 2nd Annual Pickin' in the Park:performances
and workshops. There is a beautiful campground at the park and spaces are
$12.00 per night(this includes water and electric hookups and hot showers )
If you wanna reserve a campsite call the park office at 336-674-0472.

We will be lurking around the camping area. Drop by the ratty '72 westfakia
and say hi to the beer drinking  SAE 30w hippies :)&gt;
