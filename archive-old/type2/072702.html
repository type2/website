Subject: Type2 list weekly road report (summer season)?

I was watching the national news last night when they had a story on roads
in America.  Basically it said that 60% of US roads were in poor shape and
that there were rebuilding programs all across the country.  After dodging
repaving, bridge rebuilding, and other temper raising infrastructure
projects during last summer's safaries, I thought to myself what if there
was a way to list where these problems were so you could detour around
them?  I think the reason that most of us have buses is to travel in them
in the summer months.  We plan to be going somewhere almost weekly this
summer.

Most state DOT's have either web sites or telephone lines which detail
these on a weekly basis.  What if we had a few people on the list check
these on a weekly basis and either post to the list or set up a page on the
list home page to update road problems.  I know each of us can check these
for our selves but a local could find the info easier and know what areas
are important and suggest alternatives.  A few minutes every week by a few
could save all of us a lot of inconvenience and time lost waiting hours
while road crews blast a new mountain pass.

I would volunteer to do the Utah or Intermountain area. Utah basically has
a &quot;under construction&quot; sign posted at each border crossing!  Just kidding
but not much!  I 15 is basically torn apart.  We are getting a new freeway
through the Salt Lake City Metro area.  One Side of the freeway is totally
shut down and the remaining side is barricaded into two lanes each way.  We
call it the &quot;luge&quot; not because the Olympics are coming, but because once
you get on it you can't get off until the bottom.  20 Miles of hair raising
curves, speeding vehicles, and fatal wrecks.  If you come, take the
alternate... I 215 and circumnavigate the city.

        I 80 Evanston to SLC.......Intermittant paving projects
        US 191 through Provo Canyon....... Finally Done
        I 15 St George to Hurricane....... Repaving
                And So on....

This could also include special roads that you would recommend that they
travel for scenic, &quot;hysterical&quot;, or convenience reasons.  If you were
planning a trip through Utah, I'd recommend State Road 12.  Starting at
Capital Reef National Park you ascend 10,000 ft Boulder Mt. thru aspen and
pine forrest with spectacular views of Escalante/ Grand Staircase National
Monument and Canyonlands. Thirty minutes later you descend into Escalante
NM. The Hog's Back just out of Boulder, Ut. will get you flat-lander's
attention.  Ten miles of road on the ridge of a red rock spine with 2,000
foot drops on both sides. (The old days before it was paved were better,
but my wife never could see the view from underneath the seat).  The camp
ground at Calves Creek has showers and trail to the spectacular lower
falls. You'll want to stop and see the spectacular contrast of green
foilage and vibrant red rock in Escalante Canyon.  You'll think you were on
&quot;Disneys Thunder Mountain&quot; climbing the sculpted rock surrounded the switch
backs on you way to Escalante, Ut.  When you think it couldn't get any
better you'll arrive at Bryce Canyon NP., a 20 mile amplitheatre of red
rock spires and hoo doos.  Then if you've got time you can rattle down the
road to Zions NP and Grand Canyon NP. but you'll never see more spectacular
scenery per mile than that of Highway 12.

If your headed for Yellowstone, I'd recomend you forget the interstate.
Highways 220 and 287 will put you on the Old Oregon (and California as well
as Mormon) Trail.  Independence Rock,  Devils Gate, Martin Cove, Split
Rock, Ice Slough and South Pass will give you a real first hand feel for
your country's history.  Thermopolis, if you've got kids, with hot water
springs and swimming park is a fantastic diversion. And if you travel the
Cheif Joseph highway as well as the Bear Tooth highway into Yellowstone the
park will start a 100 miles early.

I could go on but maybe I'd better not.  Can You tell what my wife and I do
all summer?

If you don't think this is a good idea, give me a line when your headed
this way and I'll tell you where the chuck holes are.  Cook you a barbeque
dinner when you get here too.

Have fun
