Subject: Re: Westy Roof racks?

Cliff:
&gt;Anyway, I noticed that the ladder was moving the
&gt; rubber seal  around on top of the roof. 

Cliff:
 Don't know about your other ideas, but as an ain'ja'neer I'd be happy
to discuss 'em (back channel, probably;).  But, most of today's
commercial ladder racks cant the ladder to 45 degrees from horizontal.  
This, theoretically, would desyncronize the harmonics of the ladder from
the flow over the roof(boy, do I sound like an egghead).  (REDNECK ON)
Try propin' sumpin' under it.  I spent a lot off time listening to a
laddder sing on a homemade roof rack during summers in college:)

Just a thought
