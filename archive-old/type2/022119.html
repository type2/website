&gt;Hey New guy I just replaced the wood a little while ago. I looked everywhere
&gt;for it. 
==============================&gt;
I replaced my bus interior wood with regular wall paneling. 
I went to Home Depot and found some of the cheapest stuff they had,
confining my acceptable selections to panel pieces that had real wood as a
backing. 
I kept going through, cherry picking the backsides of panel pieces, so as
to get what I wanted.
It turned out to be beautiful when installed with the &quot;finely selected&quot;
back side out so as to expose the wood to my bus interior.
I am bothered, knowing the wood came from a rain forest somewhere,
but.........,
and there I stop thinking about it.
