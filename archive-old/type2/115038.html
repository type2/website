&gt; For your information and protection.. FYI (eBay scam alert!)
&gt; I just 1/2 hour ago opened my email to find two notices of
&gt; suspension from eBay.
&gt; It looks like I've been &quot;suspended from all services&quot;.. I said &quot;looks like&quot;.
&gt; I'm really not! I can go right to the eBay site and do anything I want.
&gt; Don't you think that eBay would restrict my use if there were a problem?

I got the same email and I smelled a rat also. Some info here:
