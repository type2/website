Hi Chris,


&gt; How do you bring up all of these facts to your mechanic without 
&gt; feeling like you are insulting them, or without making them feel 
&gt; like your being overbearing? I don't know that either place would 
&gt; intentionally make someone feel this way, but typically, doesn't 
&gt; that feel like how ppl react when you question and question their 
&gt; practices, with the only thing to back you up is an online 
&gt; community? Many seem to write all of us off as do it yourselfers 
&gt; without a knowledge of what works and what doesnt when you do this 
&gt; day in and day out VS a few one time, at home tests.

You should always feel like you can talk to your mechanic.  If possible, read 
and then ask the list's opinion before you go so that you will at least have 
the right questions to ask.  If your mechanic makes you feel awkward, that's 
poor customer service on their part.  Sometimes stories change.  Sometimes 
they diagnose something and want to do more of a fix than is really 
necessary.  You should feel like your mechanic is your partner.  She should 
be excited and happy to be your partner in fixing your bus.  Your mechanic 
should tell you when there is something that you can easily fix yourself to 
save some dollars.  If you feel he/she belittles your knowledge instead of 
enlightens you with his/hers, get a new mechanic.
You do have more than just an online community to back you up.  You have 
books and articles you can read and you have your gut feeling.  If you save 
money on this fix, you can do something more fun with the money you saved 
like put in new door panels and take a trip to Yosemite or Big Basin.

Have fun and don't feel guilty that you don't want to be raped.  Do your 
research and find a mechanic who will be you and Jasper's partner. :P

Peace,
Jen
