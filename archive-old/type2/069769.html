Subject: clutch cable -- SNAP!

Hey all,
Driving home, I was coming to a stop, pushed in the clutch on my '78 and heard a POP sound, after which I seemed to lose all clutch function.  The pedal is now sagging, tho not staying totally down on the floor.  I was able to baby it home by shifting without clutch (light traffic tonight, disregarded red lights and stop signs) and by starting it in first when I did have to stop.  I haven't looked to make sure yet, but I assume the clutch cable is what broke, unless perhaps something in the clutch itself broke??

I will check it out tomorrow when it's light outside, and see if indeed the clutch cable is the problem.  If, however, the clutch cable is intact, what am I looking at here?  I'm worried that maybe it's not the clutch cable if the clutch is still staying somewhat off the floor.  What else could cause the above symptoms?

Any tricks on replacing the clutch cable?  Any gotchas?

Thanks in advance,
Sean
