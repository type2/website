Subject: rebuilt 1700

--0-1538763507-1030573691=:87578


i have a 73westy with a pretty much stock 1700cc, i have a stuck intake valve on the #1 cylinder, i was going to replace the heads on it, and i have been told by a few people to not put new heads on a worn motor, so, i am looking to buy a new 1700,or rebuild mine, i have never pulled the motor before, so does anybody have any tips for pulling the motor,also any tips on where to buy a good rebuilt motor or new motor, preferably here in colorado, or, a place to buy the parts for the type 4, i cant seem to find a good place to find/buy these parts

any help would be appriciated

Tyler
