&gt; &gt; now only starts and runs for a couple of seconds then it dies.

if it is fuel injection (if not ignore)

this sounds like a fuel supply problem,,,the engine starts with start
circuit but cuts out when engine starts and shifts to run mode.

.  check vacuum lines (not part of fuel circuit but will cause problem)
.  check double relay
.  check that AFM (air flow meter) plug is in tight.  this is on the back
side of the tube from air cleaner to throttle body

one way to check is to see if you can hear the fuel pump running, near 
left rear  wheel well is the electric fuel pump, when you turn on ignition
it will pump for a few seconds, then shut off, when engine starts it
should run again, if it doesn't the engine will stop when the fuel in the
loop line runs out. (couple seconds)

the AFM senses the air moving when the engine starts, and turns on the
fuel pump, if the plug comes loose it doesn't get the signal.

the double relay (on the upper left rear wall of the engine compartment,
has two plugs on the bottom) controls the fuel pump power (among other
things)

hope these hints get you started
