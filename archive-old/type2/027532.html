George -

I'm certainly perplexed.  I'll have to hit the Hayes hard tonight.  What 
I've looked at so far is rather vague, although I may have missed something 
as I skimmed versus truly reading.

Basically, since engine was already out, I:

1)  removed the starter
2)  disconnected clutch cable
3)  removed nuts, then clutch housing
4)  found circlip on clutch housing drain plug magnet
5)  started scratching my head...

I gave it my darndest trying to screw the rear input shaft (w/reverse gear 
on &amp; slid back) to the forward.  In order to be able to screw the two 
together, yes, the reverse gear has to be slid back.  This is where the 
problem starts.  If the gear is too far forward/slid even partially onto the 
teeth on the forward shaft, well then, you can't turn the rear shaft &amp; screw 
it onto the stud.  With the reverse gear back flush w/the front of the rear 
shaft, it (gear) is touching the differential &amp; results in an angle slightly 
off (&amp; in my case, since I tried anyways, a stripped stud).  Before 
stripping the stud, I tried again &amp; again (&amp; again) to get things lined up.  
Everytime the angle was right, the gear was just forward enough to be 
catching the teeth on the forward shaft.  When I'd back it up just enough 
for the gear to be free of the forward shaft's teeth, it would be resting on 
the differential, angle slightly off (up).  I'm stumped.  I wonder if it's 
possible the reverse gear is non-stock, and perhaps has a slightly larger 
circumference or is slightly longer than a stock reverse gear has (?).  OR:  
if the forward shaft, for reasons unknown to me, is slightly more rearward 
than it should be (?).  I wouldn't think the forward shaft would have 
&quot;play,&quot; be able to move forward/back.  Dunno, I'm not even pseudo-book 
smart.  &quot;PITA&quot; anyway you look at it.

I'm gonna fire my reply off to the list, also, &amp; see if someone can figure 
it out/rescue me.  I would love to avoid pulling the differential out.  I 
thought I gave it plenty-o-attempts, but maybe it will boil down to:  TRY, 
TRY AGAIN, THEN AGAIN, AND THEN SOME MORE.

Keeping my fingers crossed,

Mark

TO THE LIST:  Hey, if any kind, knowledgeable soul in the Tampa, FL area has 
the time &amp; might consider meeting up w/me to have a look, PLEASE E-MAIL!  
I'm in the Town n' Country area (mostly &quot;Town&quot; - north-central Tampa?  Near 
Tampa Intl. Airport).
