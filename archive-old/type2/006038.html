Hello all,

My name is Matt Callahan and i recentl pursached a 1969 camper from ohio
about a month ago.  It was towed on a trailer back here with me in
Rochester, NY and will be here until it is running before i drive it with
me to Massachusetts.  However i have a problem.

The Relay Lever shaft through the front axle beam is gone.  it is so worn
out that the shaft rocks back and forth when you try to turn the wheel so
therefore the front tires do not turn until you have already turned the
steering wheel at least a ahlf turn or more.

The axle has been removed as of this afternoon.  my question is, is there a
way to rebuild this shaft as it seemed to have been done by the previous
owner.  OR is there someone in this area that can sell me a complete front
axle beam assembly so i can do a quick swap and get this show on the road
as i return home to MA from college this coming weekend or next week?

Many thanks,
Matt
