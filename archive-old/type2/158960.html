Subject: Megasquirt update

After last weekend pulling my hair out over problems getting the engine 
to run even close, this weekend was brilliant.
I installed 5 ohm 25W resistors inline with the injectors so I would not 
have to play with pulse width modulation.
I pulled the distributor, checked the vacuum operation, lubed the 
centrifugal weights, and re-installed.
Also I backed off the hydraulic lifters to zero lash in case I was 
getting some valve closure issues.

I got the engine started but still had to push (advance) the timing to 
get it going. After getting it thoroughly warm it idled at 1700 rpm.  I 
tuned the fuel requirements and volumetric efficiency table to get it to 
settle down and pulled the timing back to what looked like around 7.5 
BTDC.  My timing light is of the cheap, interrupt the spark plug wire 
variety and doesn't give a clear reading.
However, this was huge success!

Today I spent $$ on a decent digital timing light, EQUUS Inova 3568, and 
tried again.  What a difference a good timing light makes! No bounce, 
bright strobe, rock solid reading - but.. my idle timing was close to 20 
degrees..

Warmed the engine up again (started on the first crank) and fiddled with 
fuel and the idle screw until I could get 7.5 REAL degrees BTDC without 
any bounce, at 950 rpm.  Even greater success!  I also check the advance 
at 3400 rpm and it was 24 degrees (beyond 7.5) so within spec.

Good! Onward to sort out warmup and acceleration enrichments before 
getting it on the road for real world fuel sorting.
