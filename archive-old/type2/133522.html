&gt; VENTURA, Calif. (AP) - A car-carrier loaded with vintage Porsches was struck

&gt; officials said.

trains don't have steering wheels, and they can take up to two miles to
stop, trains don't hit cars and trucks, cars get in front of the train.

NEVER RACE A TRAIN, in case of a TIE!  YOU LOSE!  A small diesel engine
can easily weigh more than 100 of our buses.  (200+ tons!)   and a single
railroad car can weigh 125tons!!

be carefull, don't risk your life or that of your bus.
