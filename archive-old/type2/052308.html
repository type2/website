Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder shims..need help

I would be suprized if Bergs did not have the base spacers you need. Just
search on Gene Berg or Bergs at Dogpile_dot_com or your fav search engine. The
also sell for low cost excellent procedural documents for setting up
optimized specification engines of the T-I air cooled engines but the
principles are univeral to the T-II/IV motivators.

I would never try two head spacers. Just one extra surface to leak. That's
why it's not spec procedure. If you must have good function with reliabily
and long life, don't violate basic procedures. As to the base gaskets, how
many extra sealing surfaces are you thinking about?? Look further and find
the skookum spec single spacers you need to overcome what on the face would
seem to me to be a machinist in apprentice mode or some twice precut used
heads saved and adapted by a journeyman. Veryify that both cylinder head
surfaces are dead on the same plane.

&gt;Best is if two head gaskets will work. Would yo please answer direct, as I
am 
&gt;on digest and am getting only one out of each 3 digests lately.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a zillion/Don Carron
&gt;maybe we can still build her today ?????


Only if you put in the time up front considering all contingencies. You
will never regret taking the time to get the best possible results.
