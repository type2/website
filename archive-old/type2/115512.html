Subject: Re: key broke off in ignition

The bently says to drill a hole in the shearbolt and to use a left hand 
thread cutting tap to remove it.
I have no experience with this tool.
Are they expensive?
Are they hard to use?
I noticed that no online articles said anything about it, just the Bently. 
Is there another way?
Thanks,
Kyle
