Your more than welcome Cree, that is what owning VW's is all about. I've
owned 4 Westy camper vans so far, right now I own 2 VW beetles, and we're
currently looking for a later model Westy camper, something from the early
80's.

Take care,

Courtney

Cortney. What a wonderfull site for info on VW stuff. If it wasn't for the

post on balanceing to a dime I wouldn't have got a chance to add this info

site in my VW BUSS file. Thanks to all the posters and to type2_dot_com for all

the great information. Cree 79 Bay
