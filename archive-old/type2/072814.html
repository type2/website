&lt;&lt;Here's my problem. Sometimes I take my '70 camper for drives over 30 min.
long. I shut her off and leave her. when I try to restart her again she
won't turn over. I have to leave her sitting there for at least an hour
before she will start.My guess is that the engine is too hot.When I run it
for a short time it starts up again fine.&gt;&gt; My other clue is that the last
owner neglected her.The engine is light blue and the air cleaner is really
small and chrome. Even worse,the engine is sort of dirty and has gaps in
the compartment from someone's carelessy swapping the engine.Is this it? If
so,how can I make her run right? Thanks for any help!&gt;&gt;

It sounds as if you have a case of the dreaded 'hot start' syndrome.  Check
the archives on this because there should be plenty of posts on this
subject.  This is a common problem with our beloved busses (mine included).
Seems like the most common recommendation is installation of a relay in
the starting circuit to bring 12V directly to the starter solenoid from the
battery instead of going all the way to the dashboard to the starter switch
then all the way back to the starter.  Archives will fill you in here.

If you want to have a reliable engine that will last any length of time,
you really should replace your engine seal, and any engine tin that might
be missing.  The engine seal is relatively cheap (around $15-20 at Bus
Depot) and is pretty easy to install (its foam rubber).  You have an
air-cooled engine here that sucks cool air in the top, passes it over the
engine to remove heat then dumps hot air out the bottom.  If you don't have
an engine seal (and proper engine tin), the hot air from the bottom gets
sucked in where the cool air is supposed to and your engine doesn't cool
properly.  Besides it helps keep the electrical stuff dry and clean which
also helps with reliability
