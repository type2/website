Scott Solomon sends:

&gt; So now my question is, does anyone make a larger fixture for the ACVWs that is
&gt; as strong as the V8 stands? If not, would there be anyone interested if I
&gt; decide to make heavier fixtures that will use the heavier V8 type stands?

Here's what I use:

Buy a good straight piece of 2x8 lumber and four two-inch heavy-duty
casters. The casters that swivel are best. Also get six joist hangers, which
are these metal clips you use to build floors with, and a box of 1.5-inch
deck screws.

Cut five pieces of wood. Two of them should be at least 15 inches long.
These will hold up your engine. The other three should be at least two feet
long, but if you want them to be ten feet long it really won't matter.

Measure the width of your engine case and subtract two or three inches. Call
this measurement CW. This is going to be the distance between the outsides
of the two 15-inch boards. Use a framing square to make two lines on one of
the non-15-inch boards that are (CW) inches apart. (It's best that the two
lines be centered on the board--if there are 10 inches between the line and
the end of the board on one side, there should be 10 inches on the other--
but it's not critical.) This board goes on the end of the 15-inch boards.

Using deck screws, put a joist hanger on one end of each 15-inch board, then
two joist hangers on one edge of each board. Lay the board you marked on the
floor and screw the ends of the two joist hangered boards to it. Lay this
assembly down. It should look like a pi symbol and the two legs of the pi
should be exactly vertical. Use your framing square. If they are, the board
will carry the weight of the engine; if not, the screws will. The screws
will never make it by themselves.

Take the two remaining boards and lay them on the floor, then put the pi-
shaped assembly on top of them with the joist hangers facing down. Screw the
thing together. Flip it over and attach the casters; the best place is
exactly on top of the uprights, so they take the weight of the engine
directly.

Paint it if you want, and you're done.

Now if you really want to get slick about this, make the thing long enough
so your floor jack can sit up inside of it.
