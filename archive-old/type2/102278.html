Subject: spare tire mount

Does anyone know he &quot;correct&quot; way to orient the spare tire mount on the nose? I think mine was installed upside down.

I need to replace it becase one of the studs has broken off and it's rusted anyway.  The one I now have looks similar but the bolt pattern for the nose is slightly different that's what's sold:
