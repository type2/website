Subject: Fwd: Re: Asbestos in your heating system.

i guess i didnt read all the previous posts about this asbestos thread. 
where would i find these asbestos items on my van or bug?  was it all years,
or only from 197?? on down?  anyone care to enlighten me??
  
and as john anderson mentioned *hard to gripe about $600 of free
parts*...that being said i would be a fool to at least not look into it. 
this is the first i have ever heard of asbestos being on my dear old bus!!
  
thanks for the extra info....
  
zzz
