Subject: Re: [T2] Rear lights 1972 Westy

Barry,

In your situation I would get out my multimeter and see if any positive 
voltage was getting to the appropriate terminals. The tail lights would 
be easiest as they can be on without the key in the ignition. Just pop 
the lights on one pull, and retire to rear of vehicle.

Please don't be insulted by next bit - I used to teach physics, and some 
people have a blind spot about electrics. Turn multimeter on to Volts, 
connect black lead to a good clean earth (the battery negative post 
would be best), and see if you have plus 12 volts in the appropriate 
bulb cluster. If you remove the lens assembly and touch on to the spot 
where the bulb connects, you'll also remove any element of doubt about 
where you are touching.

If that is unsuccessful, fire up the engine, wedge the brake pedal down, 
and try looking for plus 12 volts again. With the meter on Voltage you 
can't do any harm, so try any metal contacts you want.

If you are getting voltage at the appropriate point then either your 
bulbs are all shot (unlikely, but possible!), or you have no earth 
connection. If you want to be really thorough, give all the metal 
contact points with the bulbs a good clean too.
