Subject: the clutch eater

I seem to be going through clutches like most folks go through oil,
and it's really starting to bother me now that I can't blame it on a
particular transmission or engine (both having been replaced since I
first started noticing the phenomenon).  At this point, it's got to be
one of:

- - poor parts
- - improper installation
- - improper operation

For the current failure, I'm seeing two problems.  The throwout
bearing is occasionally rumbling (sounds like one ball has gone bad),
and tends to whine when the engine is running.  Also, there's a
significant chatter when engaging the clutch.  Inspection of the
friction disk shows that the center assembly is not quite in the same
plane as the outer disk (i.e., the mount is at an angle relative to
the friction surface).  Both were new as of about a thousand miles
ago.  The whine's developed over the last three weeks, the chatter for
about two weeks.

Given these symptoms, what's the likely cause?  FWIW, the friction
plate (like most of the ones I've used in the past) was manufactured
by Sachs, a Brazilian company.

Operation is a relatively slow cycle from no engagement to full, as I
dislike lugging the engine and jackrabbit starts.  I would expect this
to result in premature friction disk wear, not misalignment.  I
suppose it could be causing heating with a concomittant warping.

What's wrong with this picture, and how do I fix it?

Thanks.
