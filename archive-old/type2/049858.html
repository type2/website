&gt;This is common. The distributor drive pinion was installed 180 degrees out
&gt;of phase (&quot;backwards&quot;). Find a distributor drive pinion puller, pull out the
&gt;pinion (if you remove your distributor and look down the hole it was in,
&gt;you'll see a piece of metal with a big slot in the top and a spring sticking
&gt;out of it. That's the pinion.), turn it around and put it back in.

This is risky.  There will likely be a washer under the pinion, and if you remove the pinion the washer may fall into the crankcase.  Just rotate your plug wires 180 degrees and drive it, IMO.
