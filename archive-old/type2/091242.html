Subject: z-bed confusion

In my Sportsmofakia (yup 1/2 sportsmobile 1/2 westfalia) I got a full
width z-bed  which was missing the rear section of wood. I cut an
appropriate size piece of plywood &amp; put new foam &amp; new fabric on the
seat. It seemed to work great, but isn't exactly lineing up correctly.
I didn't realize how much a slight mis-alignment of a bed can play
havoc on your back untill HCBF. Anyway, can someone tell me how
exactly these beds are mounted? esp the alignment of the cushion
areas. 

To clarify, the bed now rests directly on the metal floor. Should it
be on a sheet of flooring like in the westys or does that start
directly in front of the seat? Does it appear that the cushions used
in the rear area are of the same thickness as the seat cushion? I
guess my other question is, was their any type of spacer that was used
between the metal frame of the bed (the one that attaches to the wheel
well) and the middle section of bed? This horrible ascii art below
shows how mine lines up. I suspect I can just put a rubber spacer on
the metal &amp; get the section up in line, but what did westfalia do.
