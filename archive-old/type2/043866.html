Subject: [T2] 69 panel van for sale

If anyone is interested I've got a 69 panel van for sale.  It's in primer, it's pretty straight except for rear corners and the lower part of the front end.  It's got a tranny but no motor.  There are, however a lot of spare parts inside that will go with the bus.  (including a block and some heads) It's in the Carson City Nevada/Lake Tahoe area.  I'd like to get $300 for it.  If anyone is interested please email me privately and i'll try to get some pictures into the digital format.   thanks for the BW.

Jess
