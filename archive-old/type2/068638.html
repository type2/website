Subject: heater blower

After spending that past few weekends insulating the front of my '78 cab,
and making a partition out of a tarp and some velcro, I've now found that
the heater fan isn't even working!  I turn on the ignition, put the red
levers down (I used to be able to hear the fan coming on), and nothing
happens.  I go back there, and the fan isn't going.  I know this could be a
number of things, including fuses (checked, fine), the cable (don't know
where it goes from the lever- does it go all the way back to trip the fan
or does it trip something up front?), some wires not connected somewhere
(looked around in there a little bit, and everything SEEMS to be hooked
up).  I'm sure there's more that I don't know about, so could someone help
me with this please?  If the cable is indeed broken, I don't think I'll
bother with trying to get it replaced- I think I'll just wire open the
flaps or somehow get the fan to just be on all the time the ignition is on
(it's gonna be cold for a while), or something else that will be easier
than finding and paying for the new cables.  I only have the Bentley book,
but it doesn't have much except for wiring diagrams, which is pretty much
Greek to me so far...

Thanks in advance, and thanks to everyone who told me about the pedals
seals.  Now that I know they're attached to the pedals and not the floor, I
think I do have them.  You can still see light when the pedals move, and
that's how it always was, right?  I think so, too.
