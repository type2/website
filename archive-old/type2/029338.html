im taking a trip to northern england in may. burnley to be exact. and a
friend there told me that a volks club meets the last thursday of the
month at some pub or another to &quot;discuss there split windscreens and
such&quot;. I was wondering if any of you english listees have any info? also
any listees in the north of england maybe like to get together for a
pint around the last month of may?
cheers
