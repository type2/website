Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 74 bus w/1600]

Clark:
I've  studied how the rear trans mount on the 72 up type 2 is constructed, and I
think it would be pretty hard to hurt it. They are loaded TOTALLY in compression.
That's not to say the engine  wouldn't shake around a lot without the rear mount,
especially twisting loads. I'd guess a type 1 weighed about 75 less than a type
4. Most all the bits are heavier. Heat exchangers, fan housing, even.

&gt;
&gt; Yeah, you're right. It wouldn't be wise.
