Hi Volks,

Barry wrote about coping with too low garage doors:
&gt; How about getting four steel wheels sans rubber. No tires, just wheels.
&gt; Junk yard wheels.  If you have enough clearance, you should be able to
&gt; roll it in and out on the bare steel wheels at minimal cost and effort.
&gt; 
&gt; (See, I saved the best for last.  But only IF you have enough clearance
&gt; underneath..)

It works, but you'll badly scratch the floor that way.  You can even 
drive it in the garage.  Maybe you could use some 14&quot; bicycle tires: 
two per wheel, which you'd fit around the parts of the wheels that 
touch the ground?  (I didn't try that, but I think it sounds as if it 
might work -- or else you'll cut the bike tires in halves :-)

Maybe, if it's just a few inches you need, you could get some of 
those ridiculous 165/50R14 tires or such ;-))) ... and run them with 
barely enough air to keep them on the wheels.  (Which of course you 
can also do with regular bus tires.)

In any case, if you're going for the low air route, I'd rather not 
drive those tires on the road afterward.  Running a tire with little 
or no pressure ruins it quite efficiently, even for just a few metres 
it might crack some threads -- better safe than sorry I say.

Yours,
    Erik.
