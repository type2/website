Subject: Re: [T2] How do you test oil temp senders?

Courtney Hook sends:

&gt; So mine is giving really neat readings like 995 or 7000 deg, etc, then drops
&gt; to zero.

That's not a Volkswagen engine, it's a raku kiln. One of my buddies in
Fayettenam is a potter; maybe he'd be interested?

One popular way to test a sender is to dip the end that attaches to your
engine in boiling water with the sender connected to the gauge. (Keep the
connector out of the water, naturally.) Also have a thermometer in the pot;
the temp of boiling water is dependent upon altitude.
