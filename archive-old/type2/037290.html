Subject: St. Patty's Karma-71 Bus

Volks:
Part 1 of 2:
In an effort to spread my good Karma of late I am offering to the first
3 respondents a laminated, color wiring diagram for 71 model busses.
It's 8.5 X 11, but very legible.

Part 2 of 2.

Took my first distance trip in my bus two weekends ago at the begining
of a week of vacation.  About 550 miles round trip.  From Jackson, MS to
Tupelo, MS along the Natchez Trace parkway.  What a perfect bus trip.
Speed limit of 50, no stops, and beautiful scenery. I PASSED THREE
CARS!!!!!! I can even show you where! I actually drive this route alot
as my parental units live on one end and I the other, but it was
entirely different in my bus.  My wife set up the table and got some
work done on the way up.  On the way back, her head was bobbing(she's
not much of a co-pilot:).  I said &quot;if your going to sleep, go in back
and lay down&quot;.  Being new to the bus, she curled up on the rear seat. I
said, &quot;no, pull down the bed. There's a pillow in that cabinet.&quot;
OOOHHHHH, say's she.  An hour later I pulled into a rest stop to rest my
stop, and she didn't even budge!  Needless to say, she likes the bus
now!  Now, I think she understands my effort, both physical and
monitary, over the last 2 years.  My parents still think I'm strange;).

Happy St. Patty's day!
