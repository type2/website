  Let me clarify this for those that have asked.
  Empi is making new manifolds, that will bolt right on, linkage and air
cleaners so all will clear under the decklid. This will be a DIRECT bolt on
installation for carburated or fuel injected 72 and later type 2 engines.

Ronnie
Does that mean that their makeing manifolds that will fit or does it mean
they'll be changing the jetting. Sorry for the simple questions but I've
wondered why they weren't used on late bays
