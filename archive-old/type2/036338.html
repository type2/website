&gt;but it seems that pollution control technology has come a long way since
&gt;they were new. 

Ahem. Peregrine (catalyzed 76 FI bus, all stock engine/exhaust) just 
tested at 0 ppm hydrocarbons and less than 1/3 average CO. Oil temp on 
the flat at 60 mph is an even 215F, so I don't think she's too lean. She's 
just clean. So put that in your whattzit and smoke it!

You cannot do better than 0 ppm HC. I don't think.
