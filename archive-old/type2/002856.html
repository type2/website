&gt;
&gt; Hi everyone...
&gt; Im hoping somebody can help me. I got an engine, what i think is an early
&gt; 70's 1600 but im not 100% sure. This is my 4th VW engine and Ive only
&gt; worked on 1800cc's and up (i am a FI guy;) )  This new engine has dual
&gt; solex carbs, I was wondering what year VW started putting dual carbs in
&gt; busses. Whatever they are, they are both mangled and will need to be
&gt; replaced. What options do I have to replace them? They are Labled PDSIT-2
&gt; and PDSIT-3. Thanks for any help you can give
&gt;
