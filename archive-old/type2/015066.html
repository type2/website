&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;This weekend, I changed my oil and attempted to put a drain plug temp sender 
&gt;into my Type 4 sump, but it would not fit.  The &quot;drain plug&quot; appears to be a 
&gt;plate with a cap nut in the center that threads onto a bolt/stud inside the 
&gt;engine.  I'd consider punching the plate, but it has ribs all around it, and 
&gt;the flat parts are too small for a standard sender.  FWIW, the engine code 
&gt;is GE046847.
&gt;
&gt;So, does anybody know of a Type 4-specific drain plug sender, or is the 
&gt;dipstick sender the way to go for these engines?
&gt;
&gt;Also, my Type 4 engine is leaking oil (big surprise).  I've seen leaks from 
&gt;the valve cover gaskets, and also suspect that oil is leaking from the 
&gt;pushrod tubes.  In addition, oil appears to be running down the sides of the 
&gt;oil filter and dripping off the bottom.  Finally, the oil sump is covered 
&gt;with oil (on the outside).

Drill and tap into the gallery by the filter.  You can get a special sender
for that position.  With regard to leaks, I bet the rings are gone,
allowing the crankcase to become pressurized.  Have you done a compression
check?
Ian
