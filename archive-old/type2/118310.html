Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Recirculated Air

Recirculating the cabin air is a very good idea.
I just finished the final install and tuning of an early BN4 in my
westy.
My 69 Dormobile had a factory BN4 without the cabin air recirculation
ducting and while it was great at heating the bus if I spilled any oil
or other smelly stuff in the engine compartment it was promptly heated
and passed into the cabin.  It would frequently distribute a fresh gas
smell on cold starts as well.  Nasty.
The Dormobile burned down with my house in Sep of 2001
(http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/olyolsen13mt) and I replace it with my current
Westy.  I purchased the complete early BN4 from a lovely lady in CA and
managed to finally finish the install and trouble shooting.
I experience none of the burnt oil smells that were frequently
associated with riding in the Dormobile.  It took some minor cobble
skills to adapt the last elbow into the cab but it was worth the extra
effort.
