Subject: Re: [T2] Re: ADMIN: Re: [T2] virus

Jeff Tickner sends:

&gt; I would prefer if people posted responses to questions to the list only,
&gt; not both the list and the questioner, unless people request a direct
&gt; response. This accomplishes 2 things:
&gt; 1: The answer is archived so it can be found in searches. I hate when a
&gt; search turns up more question like my question, then answers.
&gt; 2: It isolates everybody. Now that viruses are using the sent mail to
&gt; propagate, if you always answer to the list, then using the list CAN NOT
&gt; propagate viruses.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'll go on to say that I have sent direct responses when I felt my
&gt; response might not be as helpful and bus related as the list might need.
&gt; Obviously this is a judgement call for each person and we can only hope if
&gt; people here have the good judgement to own busses they will apply this good
&gt; judgement to other things :-)

Jeff, there's one minor problem here: When I hit &quot;reply&quot; on my e-mail
program (both MS Outlook Express and MS Entourage for Mac do this) only the
sender's address shows up in the &quot;send to&quot; field. Clicking &quot;reply all&quot; puts
both the sender and the Type 2 list in the &quot;send to&quot; field.

It's always done this, both on the old server and on this one.

Can this be fixed?
