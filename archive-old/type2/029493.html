&gt; Engine: Type 4 pancake in a 72 bus with 32-36 carb.

&gt; Problem: Intake manifold boot going to # 3 cracked and leaking, letting
&gt; air into the mixture
&gt; 
&gt; Question: Would this cause the # 3 valves to be a LOT tighter than the
&gt; other valves?

Could be.  lean mixture means more heat means dropped seat or stretched
valve stem.  Regardless, rapidly tightening clearance means a head
rebuild.

&gt;                  Would this cause the engine not to idle during warm up

Could be.
