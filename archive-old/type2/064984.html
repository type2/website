I have been told by a couple of sources, that the Westy automatics

My &quot;new&quot; Westy developed this problem a week after I purchased it.

My question is this:  Am I going 
to damage the tranny by running it in this condition?  Doesn't seem to 
affect any of the other gears...

SO I wrote:

Dear Juli,
My automatic tranny (in my 78 bus, but from an 81) goes into reverse OK
when I startup, but it does hang at the top end of 1rst gear for a while before it
finds it within itself to shift to 2nd. It only does this when first 
starting out, and although it doesn't get very cold in Santa Barbara, it
seems slightly correlated with low temp. Otherwise it runs fine.

Adjusting the shift linkage is the only thing I can think of offhand that
might help your problem and that maybe not. It sort of seems like a problem of
unsufficient tranny fluid pressure to me, and I've always thought that it just 
takes a few minutes to get that sluggish stuff pumped up properly on a cold
morning. Doesn't seem to damage anything as far as I can tell. No reverse would
stop me cold osme mornings. I always start by backing out.

 But then, I'm no tranny mechanic, just a hopeful user. 

Any tranny wizards out there? These things were black boxes to John Muir too.

I think you're OK,
Surfer Bob
