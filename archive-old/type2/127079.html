&gt; Anyone thought of having the whole type 2 body sandblasted and

&gt; I know it must be expensive but it is surely a good investment: how much
&gt; will a perfect type 2 be worth in 30 years time?


The problem is that a galvanized bus would not be considered &quot;perfect&quot; by
the concours restoration types, as it was not original.

In the concours Ford Model T competitions, the winner is often determined
by who has the correct plating on certain bolts on the transmission!
Galvanizing the whole car would drop it right out of the running!
