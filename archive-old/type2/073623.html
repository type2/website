Subject: stuck seat

--part1_c4.1b94adba.28eb2ce2_boundary

I've been trying off and on for a few days trying to get the front seat free 
from its rusted tracks. I sprayed Kroil along the tracks and did a little 
hammering from time to time with no results. Last night I noticed there 
seemed to be room between the seat and the metal pedestal back to insert a 
compact scissors jack  A couple of turns on the scissors jack and the seat 
slid quietly free. Hope this tactic is of use to someone.
