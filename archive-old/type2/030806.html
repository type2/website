Subject: Oil Temp Sensors?!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9907090724490.8441-100000_at_larry_dot_cas.utk_dot_edu&gt;

&lt;This is for a '69 1600 DP engine.&gt;

I've taken the plunge.  I'm finally installing an oil temp gauge, it's the
first one I've ever owned in six years of various VW ownership.

I must be getting paranoid...

Anyhow.  The reason I'm wasting everyone's time is that I need to know if
mounting the sensor in the pressure relief is a good idea, or even
do-able.  My sensor came with instructions for butchering the sump plate,
but I can't bring myself to do it. (In reality, I can't make heads or
tails of the diagram.  The fake 3-d effect that the &quot;artiste&quot; used makes
it impossible to understand.)

Dave Schwarze mentioned about 750 moons ago:

&gt;The best location would be at the crankshaft bearings, but it's
&gt;impossible to measure it there.  The sump is an acceptable compromise
&gt;(the dipstick senders are in the sump also), but I think it is also
&gt;possible to mount one in the pressure relief valve - I think Bob Hoover
&gt;has done this.
 
I was wondering if anyone has ever REALLY done this, or even if it's
possible.

If it requires too much thought or engineering, I'll probably just drill
the hole.  But I would appreciate a better diagram, is there one out
there?

TIA.
