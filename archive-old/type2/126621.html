Subject: Building door panels

Well, I picked up some 1/4&quot; pressboard stuff (shiny on one side,
waffle pattern on the other, seemed similar to the original door
panels, so...) from Home Despot for $6.50. A full sheet. Enough for
several door panels!

You can see the difference between the rotted and moldy old one and
the new one I had just cut. I used a jigsaw for the long cuts: outside
and inside the vent hole. The rest was done with this, my new favorite
tool:

It's just a rotary cutter bit, but I've never had one before and I
love it! It takes some practice getting the hang of controlling it.
But even with my sloppy cuts, it's within the tolerance range.

I'll cover it next chance I get and then it goes into the door (with
new plastic of course!)
