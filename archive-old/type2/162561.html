&gt; Well, it's Christmas early for me.  I've been ogling the 261 piece  tool set with a nice 4-drawer tool chest (at Sears) for some  time.  It's normally $269.99 but I've seen it on sale for  $199.  Well today they had it down to $188 and I couldn't  resist.  Maybe now I won't misplace my tools as much.  Here's  a link if you're interested:

hmmmm, I've had a big tool box with all those drawers etc, and lately it
seems to keep getting heavier every time I lift it, so I wandered by Home
Depot and bought a couple of the $5-9 Stanley tool boxes and split my
tools up into sockets ,  wrenches,  etc  each getting their own litte box

can't be getting old, must just be getting more tools........ yeah that's
it, more toools!!!!
