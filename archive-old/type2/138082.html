Subject: VW mentioning on TV

On the &quot;This Week in Washington&quot; gabfest, George Stephanopolous
mentioned a focus group that was asked what car would they as-
sociate with the political parties...The GOP was a Hummer, the
Dems got a VW Microbus...
(No Political content...Just callin' 'em like I heard 'em... ;-)
