Subject: VW engine modifications

Hello, my name is chad and I recently inquired about engine
modifications for my 1972 type 2 westfalia.  I realize that my
expectation were a bit high, and I am aware that the vw will not keep up
to todays modern standars, but I do want to get as close as I can
without giving up my VW, I love it and I will drive it.  So if anyone
has some feedback regarding engine modifications for a type 2 1700cc or
1600cc engine that are successful and still maintain an adequate amount
of reliabitily and efficiency, this would be greatly appreciate, as I am
a new and enthusiastic about my VW.  I would also like to add that I was
rather disappointed with some of the lists menmber response to my
earlier posting, as I am new I expected that you people with experience
would have guided me to some engine mods, but also pointed out that my
earlier stated expectations were a bit too lofty, instead I got &quot;buy a
ford&quot; and &quot; A VW is not for you&quot;.  To these people I would like to say
thank-you for you support and encouragement and I'm glad you never ever
had problems where you needed a little guidance.  Plus I have also
received mail that other members had similar questions to my own, so to
those of you out there whatr successful modifications do you recommend
and what kind of gains did you get? (I.E. carbs mods, rocker arms,
external oil coolers, engine rebuild kits, high voltage ignitions etc.
thank-you.  And please lets be postive to each other!
