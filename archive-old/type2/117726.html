Subject: Re: [T2] Factory Engine Preparations

Joe,

You are going to love the answer to this one.

Several years ago, one of the magazines sent reporters to the factory
in Mexico to go thru and ask just those questions.  

The one I liked was one they finished a beetle, they put gas and
oil in it and started it up...drove it on to the dynomometer at the end of 
the production line and just floored it untill the valves floated.

They then drove it out into the lot to await the transport to the 
dealer....

And after all the love and care that we put into an engine rebuild...

Otherwise, lots of info in the library about breakin procedures...both 
scientific and not.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; Since expanding my skills from maintaining to rebuilding 1600 SP/DP engines,
&gt; I wondered if anyone knew what type of fully assembled engine tests ,
first start or break- in procedures were done at the factory prior to 
shipping Mexican built vehicles to the dealer?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
