From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt; because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
&gt; Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason:
with
&gt; the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
&gt; accidentally backs into you.

So much for that myth; should have realized that myself.  The tire on the
front simply frees up interior space.  [duh]

Silly me. :O)
