Subject: New Volkswagen Website and parts for sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everybody I just came across a large stash of parts and a large # of 
buses. I have not even started looking at everything i came upon but i know i 
have some really good things. My job now is to sell these buses and these 
parts. So i have set up a new site to do just that. The site has only been up 
for a few days now so the content is still growing. There is some good 
pictures of some of the parts and a few of the buses up right now. Just to 
let everyone know already all parts and buses are located in IL. Take a look 
and thanks for your time
