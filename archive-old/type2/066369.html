Subject: Re: New M&amp;M Colors (f)

&gt; Just found out about the new M&amp;M colors - teal, pink, orange, etc.  So now
&gt; we know what VW did with all the leftover paint and fabric dye from the
&gt; '70's busses :-) 
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if I can get a bag of just the orange ones, to fill the
&gt; blumenvasen on my '73?

Me thinks I really know where the paint went.  Get on VW's US site 
&quot;www.vw_dot_com/cars/&quot; and check out the new crazy &quot;Design Jetta&quot;  It 
would be pretty cool to have!
