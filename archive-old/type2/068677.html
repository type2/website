Subject: Bitch of a job - 2ltr engine install

Over the weekend I re-installed my fuel tank, replaced the fuel filler pipe and all those 2&quot; fuel lines (including the hidden one!) which went pretty smoothly. Then came the installation of the engine!
Why Oh Why did VW change the design of the back bar! On my old 1600 I had no trouble what so ever, the backbar being removable so the engine can slide in. On the 2litr however its solid. Also the gearbox is firmly attached by two bolts to the chassis, so no downward play from that either.
  The problem then is to manouver the engine in such a way as to get clearance for the clutch and the bottom studs, and at the other end the oil filler tube. After an hour or more of tilting this way tilting that way, etc, all I got for my trouble was markings all over the new paint job of the engine housing!
  So how did I do it? Probably not the way you should, but here's how. I undid the gearbox and lowered it down with a bottle jack. I had to remove the rear tin plate as you cannot tighten these bolts up again otherwise. Slid the engine in and hay presto slotted in first time no problem!! Then with both jacks, pushed the engine and gearbox back up into position and did up all the necessary bolts.
  I left it at this point. So I still have to put that peice of rear tin plate in. Unfortunately I think that might be a problem, but I would like to way up two points. Is the swearing and frustration and damaging and ... etc of the tilting method worth all the hassle? The lowering of the gearbox method let me do the job in five minutes! And boy did it feel good. So as far as that tin plate is concerned if it doesn't fit it shall get cut and bent till it does! Shame but thats what happens with new methods.
  Has someone else done it like this before or have you any tales to tell of the 2ltr engine. I think I'm going to do a web page of facts and figures fopr the 2ltr. Send me anything as I have unlimited webspace!

In summary I wouldn't like to do the job again as descroibed in the book. My way... no problem.

Best
Ian
PS I'll let you know when the page is built. I intend to photo a few of the parts I replaced and how for reference (including the well perished fuel filler pipe and 2&quot; sections).
