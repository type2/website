That surprises me as after 6 years on this list I remember many, many people
claiming their Westfalia conversions were based on sunroof minibuses which
would be a 24 deluxe microbus, at least up to '73 (ish) when they switched
the roof to the open the other way.

So all you Westfalia conversion owners what are the first 2 digits of your
chassis number, and model year of your bus?
Private mail to me and the anonymous &quot;ncbus&quot; would be best

Good luck

In the US all Westfalia Camper conversions seem to be model 23,
kombi. Other converters such as Adventurewagen, ASI, Sprotsmodbile
and Sundial would convert whatever they could get ahold of.

The bus Jamie is talking about is a real Dormobile conversion, not a
westy with a Dor top as most of the ones in the US seem to be.


&gt;Hi Jamie,
&gt;
&gt;These windows are perfectly normal for the lower
&gt;specified versions of the transporter, a check on the
&gt;chassis number would probably show it to be 21...
&gt;(panel van) or 23... (Kombi).
&gt;Westfalia conversions were usualy fitted to 22...
&gt;(microbus) or 24... (delux microbus) models, which had
&gt;a higher spec.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck
