&gt; Bizarre...the only thing I can imagine where hissing in the cab could be
&gt; related to engine trouble is a vacuum leak:
&gt;
&gt;  1) Do you have an aftermarket vacuum gauge? Maybe the hose is coming
&gt; loose
&gt;
&gt; 2) The brake booster is vacuum powered and is located under the cab on
&gt; older buses (not sure about an '80), but if it or it's hose leaked, you
&gt; would notice hard braking as well

That sounds like the mostly likely explanation -- braking has been getting 
harder over the past week or so.

Thanks,
