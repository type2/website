Subject: RE Rust Removal--

There are times when there is only a rust coating and the metal
underneath is still pretty good-- I have used a product called  EXTEND,
by Duro--All you do is clean of the loose rust and paint this product
on.  The rust then turns to METAL!! honest--you can sand it, --file it,
paint it, drill it--it is VWonderfull!! When EXTEND is painted on a rust
free surface--NOTHING happans!! This product only re-acts to the rust
forming a new &quot;Metal&quot;
Again i have used this and minutes later painted right over it--
sincerly, TWWM, uncle jerry
