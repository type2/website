&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Sounds like a solution we need to homebrew!!! More
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; power, better emissions, better fuel efficiency...
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Think we could do it for less than $14K?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I'd like to see a controlled, independent test of this concept.  It takes
&amp;gt; as much energy to liberate hydrogen via electrolysis as it returns when
&amp;gt; burned.  From the description in the article, it seems like just another
&amp;gt; perpetual motion machine.

if they could use the excess heat to liberate the hydrogen...
