Subject: Bay window Charms/keychains

Hi Volks,

Since it's Friday I thought I'd let yall know about something I just found
in a catalog that I've never seen before...Sterling Silver Bay window
charms  19.95, Key rings 15.95, and tie tacs 12.95.  The charms and key
rings are a whole bus , the tie tac is just the front half.  I just thought
I'd pass these on as I see very few toys, shirts or really anything that is
a bay window.  These are from Mid America 
Designs  1 (800) LUV BUGG  As usual I have nothing to do with this company
and just ordered something and have yet to receive it.

Peace

Snoopy
