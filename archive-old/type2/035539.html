&gt; i put a new clutch cable and bowden tube into my '64 bus today.  when i
&gt; finished this i got in to take a quick test drive, but the clutch pedal fell
&gt; to the ground with a snap sound.  i crawled under and checked the wing nut
&gt; thinking that it stripped or something, but to my dismay, the clutch lever
&gt; was no longer vertical but was now houizontal.  can anyone tell me what it
&gt; will take to fix this inconvenience on my daily driver?   thank you.    ben
Ben,
Check that the return spring on the clutch fork is properly positioned
and in tact.
