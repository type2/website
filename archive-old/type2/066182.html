&gt;'75   Pat' Flynn's '75 has an electric fridge behind the passenger seat, 
&gt;      a stove/sink behind the drivers seat, 
&gt;      the bed/seat is to the passenger side
&gt;      and the closet is behind the driver in the rear.  
&gt;      I forget where the table is.

'74 and '75:  same layout except for location of table.  Orange buses 
lacked stove and had icebox rather than fridge.  Yosemite Yellow and White 
buses were deluxe and had icebox, fridge, jump seat between two front 
seats, dual battery system with charger, and (in 75 only, I think), front 
table that attached to dash..  In '75 the deluxe buses had an addtional 
passenger seat in the rear along the drivers side wall, just behind the 
fridge.  In '74, the table was hinged to the drivers side wall, in '75 it 
swiveled on the same type of arm as a '76-up.  Also first two years to have 
a full-sized bed up top.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'76   The &quot;linear&quot; layout.  
&gt;      All cabinets proceed back along the driver's side
&gt;      First is the sink/(optional) stove cabinet, then
&gt;      the icebox/storage box cabinet, next to 
&gt;      the bed/seat cabinet behind the passenger seat and 
&gt;      a short clothes cabinet behind the driver in the rear of the bus.
&gt;      the table is on an arm attached to the rear corner of the sink cab.
&gt;      the passenger seat rotates to face rearward and the table can be set
&gt;      so three can eat (as you did :-)
&gt;      Poptop - mine is a hardtop (Howdy, Jean-Baptiste!), but the poptop 
&gt;      for this year hinges at the rear and contains a full double bed
&gt;
The '76-79 deluxe models had all of the amenities listed above for the '75 
- - fridge instead of icbox, center jumpseat between front seats (now with 
storage), dual battery. stove, dash mounted table, etc.  In '76 and '77 
yellow buses were standard and green were deluxe; in '78-79, green were 
standard and tan were deluxe.  Also, in '79 there were a limited number of 
Champaigne Edition deluxe Westies in two-tone brown/white, with chrome 
bumpers, brown dash, clock, etc.

Gee, I've been doing this too long, haven't I?
