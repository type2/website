Subject: Pulling Type 4 engines

I posted a different method to the list some while ago, but it was
buried in a lot of restoration talk, so it was easy to miss.  I never
use a jack now to pull the engine, just the comealong and some milk
crates.  I'll repost the pertinant info:

I used a method to pull the engine that I've never seen anybody mention,
but it sure works nicely, especially if you don't have any friends.  I
open the over the engine hatch, put a 2x4 between two milk crates
stacked on either side of the opening and hung a come-along from the
board.  Then I put a stainless steel cable bridle on the engine on the
centerline
using two attach points that seemed made for the occasion.  Winch up the
tension, pull the nuts and underengine mount and swing the engine back.
Hanging from the cable gives you lot's of easy motion to match up the
bolts and I did it alone both in and out.  Actually, I still had the
camper out so I put the 2x4 across the top opening for the bunk which
gave me even more cable length.  From there, it's an easy lower to the
ground and then slide it out under the rear apron.  If you have a bus
from before '72, disregard the above, it's just too easy to just use the
jack.
