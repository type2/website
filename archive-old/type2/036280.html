Subject: Re: smelly left turn - gas filler tube fix?

This was the first problem we encountered with my beloved bus. Yes, the
part is unavailable, dammit, so what we had to to was take the part out
and using gasoline proof tape cut and redo the part and then put it back
in.  It helps it you don't fill the tank up more than halfway.  Every
once in a while I still get the gas smell, which is why I carry a fire
extinquisher!  Good luck!

&gt; understand the replacement part is unavailable?  What have folks done to fix
&gt; this problem?
