Subject: re: Westy tent plastic clips - what to use if broken?

From: &quot;Mike&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt;What's the chance that I could buy just one of these OEM clips from someone?
&gt;I went out cyber looking for them, and they don't seem to be available from anyone.

If you think about who would have spare OEM clips (ie, someone who found a wasted tent and scrounged them), I think you'll realize there are likely 
only two chances, one of which is &quot;slim&quot;.

The S-hooks will do the job just fine and no one will ever notice except you.
