&gt; 2 The 1.8 I have to replace it with is a 75 and had F.I. so I'll have to run
&gt; an electric pump with pressure regulator.

only if you use the FI, DON'T use the stock FI pump if you use carbs

&gt; Question for the list:
&gt; The 1.7 has a center mount ( I guess Holly/ Webber) carb which seemed to
&gt; work well. I have some 40mm Webbers that I was going to use on the 1.8 in
&gt; another application. Which carb/carbs would you use?

personally if I had the entire FI system I would use it,  the FI system
works better on a FI engine I think, getting carbs right is a real PITA
