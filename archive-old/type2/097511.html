Subject: Brake Adjuster Advice

Thanks to everyone for the good suggestions for extracting my frozen star
adjuster. I'll be trying again tomorrow night and I have no worries. Second
question: is there any good reason for getting the german brake shoes
instaed of the NAPA shoes at half the price? (flame suit on)

Thanks again,
Dave
