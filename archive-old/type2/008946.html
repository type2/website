Dear Folks-
		I installed a new degree pully on my 1600 dp and when I installed it
and put on the belt I found out it was loose.  So I shimmed it and
shimmed it again and cannot get the belt tight.  right now I have it as
tight as I can and there are no shims inbetween the generator wheel.  Is
there any sugestions on how I can get this belt tight?

Thanks in advance
Chuck
