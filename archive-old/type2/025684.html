I am having difficulty connecting the tube from the heat exchanger to the
control box/flap to the heat exchanger end. I get the tube on the heat
exchanger tighten it up and then go to connect the other end and the first
end comes off. I thought it would be good if I could weld this but ... I do
not weld and do not know someone who does short of paying someone. Could I
use JB weld? What I worry about is the heat. I looked at JB weld and it has
no cautions about it being flammable or not using over a certain temp.
