Subject: engine tin

can someone please tell me if i am going to need &lt;bus&gt; specific engine 
tin?

i have an engine out of a beetle that i'm going to put in my 64 standard. 
it &lt;the bus&gt; currently has no engine, or tin, or rear apron and this will 
be my first experience with doing this.

thanks,
-matthew
