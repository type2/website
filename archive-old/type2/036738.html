Subject: HELP! Torsion arms back in?

List,

i pulled the torsion bars out of the passenger side of my bus.  I was going to
switch the entire assemblies with the ones from my parts bus, but a closer
inspection revealed that mine are in better shape than my spares -so i need to
get them back in.

i have not removed the steering knuckle from the arms - do i have to?  I have
tried to reinstall the arms, but it seems they won't (or i can't get them to)
line up with the bushing up in the beam.

What do i have to do?  The bus is on jack stands all the way around - the
front ones are on the front beam.

please help,
clark in ky
