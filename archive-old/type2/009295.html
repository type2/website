&gt; Sorry to dice with starting another FART, but I've got to get some
comments on
&gt; what happened the other night:
&gt; 
&gt; I was looking over a rusty bus for a friend (He has an LHD late bay
- no sills
&gt; or interior - and had been offered a rusty, engineless, RHD '73
camper in lieu
&gt; of some cash for a computer deal). The owner of the camper has put
300k miles on
&gt; it, and gone through 3 engines. He still has the last engine which
he has pulled
&gt; to put into a '63? &quot;American model&quot;? Beetle. We talk about where he
has been,
&gt; and I comment that it must have been expensive on petrol for his
regular trips
&gt; to London, Scotland, etc. This is where he drops his bombshell:
28-30 mpg around
&gt; town, 32-35 mpg on a long run. I am politely sceptical about this,
so he takes
&gt; me into his garage where he is &quot;tarting up&quot; the engine, and says
&quot;What you need
&gt; is that set-up&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; He has a 1600DP with an extractor exhaust (EMPI), a dual choke
progressive
&gt; Webber on a trick manifold (looks like the stock centre portion
without the
&gt; heater pipes, except there is a square alloy casting where the
upright tube
&gt; would be, which mates up with the Webber carb. He says he also has
bigger valves
&gt; in the heads, and a mild cam, but the carb / exhaust were the magic.
Claims he
&gt; could get the bus upto 80mph with this set-up. He's an intelligent
bloke, I
&gt; don't think he's BSing, he's obviously had the bus long enough to
know it inside
&gt; out, but 35 mpg!! Imperial gallons, that is -  more than 40 mp(US)g ?

Actually, US gallon mileage would be less, as the gallon is smaller. 
Figure around 31 or so...

&gt; Can there be any truth in this? :O

Not unless he drives around at a constant 35 MPH or is good with
spells and incantations.

Fact is, a bus in good tune gets around 20 mi/USgal.  This can be
improved with better fuel metering but I find a 50% improvement to be
a huge jump!  You are still fighting with the frontal area of a bus
and a coefficient of drag that isn't exactly &quot;slippary&quot;.  I'd want to
take some measurements myself before I bought his story.
