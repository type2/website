Subject: Re: [T2] And speaking of alternators...

&gt; How many HP does it consume to spin a higher-rated alternator? Is

&gt;

There is a theoretical, 100% efficiency amp-per-hp ratio:

  1hp = 746watts
  amps x volts = watts

  hp = amps x volts / 746
  volts = 13

  hp = amps x 13 / 746

  1 amp = 0.017hp

Assuming a 70% efficient alternator (fairly high, but not
unreasonable) and negligable losses in wiring, each amp costs you
0.025 hp.

Keep in mind this is per amp consumed, not per amp that the alternator
can potentially produce.  There's almost no additional power required
to spin a higher-output alternator is it's not loaded any more than
the stock one.

Also keep in mind that the alternator can't respond instantly, so that
number is also limited to continuous draws, with peaks coming from the
battery.  A 1500 W stereo won't be drawing 115 amps continuously.
