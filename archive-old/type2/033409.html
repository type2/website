&gt;What is another option for me to free rusty bolts?

Here's one that I've heard of.  Tried it and it didn't work, but then
nothing else did either...

Heat bolt w/torch; get it red-hot.  Shut off the torch.  Quickly apply a bar
of paraffin wax to the threads.  Apply necessary force with idiot bar
(appropriately-shaped piece of metal with idiot on one end).

Paraffin vapor is highly flammable.  No sparks, no flames when trying this.
