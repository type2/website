Subject: Re: [T2] air/fuel ratios for a 2.0L

Not many people are aware the stock VW (pre-1971) had A/F of 11.5:1!

now that I have dispensed this useless piece of trivia..... ;-)


 Well, when you ran with carbs, what ratios were you looking at on the
 WBO2 meter?  David thinks 12.5:1 is good for WOT, would you agree with
 this number.

13:1 is what I like, 13.5:1 for cruise and driving around. Drop them .5 for
all conditions if turbocharged with carbs.

 I have a fully adjustable EFI, now I'm just looking for the numbers to
 fill it.  I unfortunately don't have engines to burn up, so I'm looking
 for the numbers from other people that have done the testing.  I would
 venture to guess that there's a good number (such as 12.5:1) that is a
 good compromise between power and heat.

a lot of it depends on for how long you are going to run at full power. You
can run leaner (save on plugs and mpg) if you only use it seconds at a time.
If you are an animal, go richer.
