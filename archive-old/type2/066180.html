Subject: Doesn't he have some relation to Grendel?

Doesn't this guy have some relation to Grendel?  We all know what &quot;good
condition&quot; means, I wonder what &quot;really good shape&quot; and &quot;fairly&quot; and &quot;good&quot;
mean...

For the newbies on the lists, surf to
http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/grendel/ and you'll know all about Grendel.

Maybe he's bought a dictionary to learn the REAL meaning of those adjectives?

Subject: '72 VW bus (for parts-$350)

I have to sell my '72 bus. Body is in really good shape, fairly
new tires. Motor making funny noises. Drives excellent, won't
charge a battery, Would like $400. I've   done all the wiring up,
transmission is good. Would consider trade for a decent tranny
for my '62 bug.


Call:  206-941-5181
Or email ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu

I haven't used vi in years...since when did it become my default
editor????
