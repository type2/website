Subject: [T2] Reluctant owner of another bus (long)

My mom has 10 cats. The house is overrun with cats. They are everywhere,
they're always knocking stuff over and getting underfoot, sitting in
front of the TV, getting in my way when I'm trying to shave, watching me
eat... But when Mom sees a kitten on the side of the road, she has to
rescue it. Now I'm starting to understand...

My boss is clearing out junk cars from a rental property, for a new
tenant. At one time, this property used to be the body shop for Vintage
Volkswagen, here in Greenville, SC, so there are lots of stripped, rusty
bugs back there, buried in the weeds. There was a green Ghia that caught
my eye, but I couldn't get a close look at it, as it was buried towards
the back of the yard.

&quot;Since you're just having these cars hauled away, can I have the Ghia?&quot;
I asked my boss.

&quot;You can have anything you want, as long as you get it out of here in
the next day or two,&quot; he told me.

In the process of clearing out the weeds and dragging the cars out so
the wrecker could get to them, the right rear fender of the Ghia was
torn up badly. The car might have been savable before that, but now it
is too much of a project for me.

There's a late model bay, red and white, lots of surface rust but no
holes or dents. Both bumpers are there, all seats are there. It still
has the engine in it, with the dual carbs, so I guess it must be a
'72-'74. I didn't really give it much attention, since I already have a
bus I'm happy with (and I prefer earlier model buses), but I did mention
to my boss that the bus had lots of valuable parts on it, hoping he
would tow it to the shop.

Boss decided he didn't want the bus, didn't have room for it, and if I
wanted to pay the tow to my house, I could have it. Otherwise, it's
going to the crusher.

Damn.

I've got a '67 hardtop deluxe (my son's), a '74 beetle, and a '69
squareback in my back yard already, besides my own '67 westy. I'm just
waiting for the city to complain about all the VW's in the back yard. I
don't really want or need another project, but I'd feel awful if this
bus went to the crusher. Its structurally in better shape than my '67
was when I rescued it.

So, here's the deal. I *have* to fix my son's '67 first. I have a lot of
work to do on the squareback, and I'm getting paid to do that one. The
new bus will have to go on the back burner until either I have time to
fix it, or someone provides a new home for it. I'll let it go pretty
cheap as is, but if I fix it and get it roadworthy, I'm gonna want mo'
money for it.

If anyone is interested, please p-mail me. I'll try to have some pix in
the next day or two, and I'll have a better idea of its condition when I
get it home tomorrow morning.
