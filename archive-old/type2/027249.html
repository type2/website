New to the list and new to the bus owner club, so bear with me -- any advice 
would be very much appreciated (the archives didn't have a clear solution 
for this one, though it's probably buried there somewhere);

Just bought a 75 bus which hadn't been run for over a year, had the local 
mechanic check it out/tune it/change the fluids, etc, and then drove 100 
hway miles with no problem until I got on to the local roads, and then going 
up a small incline and down shifting (4th to 3rd or 3rd to 2nd), the stick 
shift suddenly felt slack and I could not find a lower gear to put the car 
into. I couldn't make the crest of the hill; the clutch appears to engage 
since when I let it out while idling, the car starts to inch forward before 
stalling; it feels like it is in 4th gear and I can't find neutral or 
anything else for that matter; the stick shift is not completely slack-I can 
push down and feel something like reverse but it doesn't change the gears; 
is this a linkage issue? something worse?  Are there any tests to confirm my 
problem here?  Can I do this work without pulling the transmission (i.e. 
breaking down and finding a mechanic?)
Thanks in advance.
