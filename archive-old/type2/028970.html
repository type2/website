George,

You know that is supposed to have a 1600 dual port? It must be in perfect
condition even with a new engine $3500 ouch. If you really want a westy then
hold out. You'll be hacking up what sounds to be a perfect bus and you will
never have a &quot;westy&quot;. For $3500 you should be able to find a really decent
74 or later camper. Hope this doesn't offend.

Subject: [T2] transporter to westy conversion


Hello
I was wondering if anyone could tell me if this idea I have is a bit on the
crazy side...
I have the chance to buy a 71 transporter with a brand new 1400 engine for
$3500. This bus is in great condition. However what I really need is a
pop-top.. would it be crazy to take the pop-top of my 74 westy and put it on
the 71 transporter... would I be breaking the law?

thanks
dready george (dredlock420_at_hotmail_dot_com)
74 westy... or is that rusty?
