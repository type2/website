Hmm, have to join the fray on this one.  This does not seem unreasonable to me!

Ok, I started with a 1200.00 bus, a little high maybe but it had a clean body.
Worn out engine ok, lets throw in another 2000.00, a little high maybe but hey,
it was expensive finding out that oil leak was a cracked block.  lets talk
paint, I did it myself for about 500.00, but it looks like it did it myself, a
good paint job would run 2 to 3K ( I hear the flames comming).  Ok, now lets
talk brakes, shocks and those misc parts like a smog pump, alternator, cv
joints.  Oh, I have not included my time but lets forget that because it's fun -
.  10K?  I would have laughed 2 years ago, but now it seems like a good deal!

BTW, don't take me too seriously, just my .0002 cents worth.
