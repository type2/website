Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe

It's funny, I was talking to the HAZMAT people on the campus here and
they have a whole stock of golf tees.  They said they're the perfect
thing for stopping fuel lines..

Wonder how I met the HAZMAT people in the first place? :)

&gt; I've found golf tees to work great for plugging the fuel line!  I've used
&gt; them on my '70 but haven't tried them on my '78 which I think has 7mm ID
&gt; instead of 5mm ID fuel lines.  It should still work though since the golf
&gt; tee flares.
