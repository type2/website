hi, I just bought a 69 Poptop Camper and have a question about the
original flooring.  Some one long ago put a layer of plywood over the
steel floor and made a fairly intellegent diagonal cut in the wood so
you can wedge it in tight.  I thought it was the work of Gunther or
Klaus, but as I examined the underneath, I saw they used 4&quot; sheetmetal
screws spaced erratically.  then I thought this may be the work of Gilly
or Cletus instead.

Did the Campers originally use plywood to offer some structural support
to keep the floor from flexing?  The metal underneath is rust free, so i
am puzzled about why they went to this trouble.  Thanks for your help.

Gary
