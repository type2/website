Subject: Re: [T2] my wife wants a price/amount estimate

Thanks Jeff, was it a conventional sprayer or an HVLP? By the way what about 
the compressor I failed to ask that earlier as part of my survey (=D). 
Backyard, garage, loaned booth?

Thanks,

Michael Knight

The gun is a Campbell Hausfield, and a cheap one, cost me around 50-60 bucks 
as I recall. I failed to mention my use of one gallon was for 3 coats of 
paint, not one. I don't know what the guy is talking about at one gallon per 
coat! I thinned the paint, 3 parts paint to one part thinner, and the gallon 
cost me around $90.00. I just painted my motorcycle with the same Dupont 
Centari paint, but have wet sanded it (1200 grit) to get a smooth as glass 
finish-I never did that with the bus, just lived with the slightly orange 
peeled finish.
