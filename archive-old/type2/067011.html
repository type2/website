Subject: Re: Q: What kind of trailer hitch for my '72 camper?

I don't think that this is possible. My father in law has a trailor and
hitch shop, and being a sound bus owner have tried to find a hitch for my
78. There isn't one.
I am currently manufacturing my own and will be able to give anyone
specifications on one.

&gt; and I'll only be towing it 1.5 miles once in the Spring and then again
&gt; in the Fall.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said that, does anyone know about any kind of hitch that will
&gt; mount to my bus without replacing the stock '72 bumper?
