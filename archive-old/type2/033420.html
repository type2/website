Subject: Rocket arm threads stripped on cyl head

I removed my valve covers yesterday to pin down the source of a ticking
sound in my '81 stock california vanagon.  I decided to re-torque my rocker
arm shafts then adjust the valves according to bentley.  Anyway, I
discovered that two rocker arm bolts have apparantly stripped the cylinder
head threads.  #1 and #2 each have one bolt that will only torque to about
4-5 ft-lb.  The other bolts torque to spec (11 ft-lb).  How will this
affect preformance?  Is there an easy (i.e. something I could do myself
without a specialialized tool) fix?  Thanks for the help!

-John
