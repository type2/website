Subject: Long lug bolts for alloy wheels???

     Well, I finally found some nice Mercedes rims, 15x6.5, but they
weren't cheap -- $330 for 4 including the _at_$%_at_$% 9% sales tax here.
Anyway, I drilled out the lug holes to 14mm, but now I find that the
stock bus lug bolts are about an inch too short.
    Anybody know where I can get longer lug bolts and what the procedure
is to remove the old ones. Seems like they would maybe just pop out
backwards with a good hammer blow, but don't want to bash one up and
find out differently.
