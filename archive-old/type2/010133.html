Subject: Rear Brake Adjustment SNAFU
Message-ID: &lt;19990714112617.1.5732.qmail_at_spiritone_dot_com&gt;

Hello Again --
Well, here's another #$%&amp;* good one.  During my attempt to fine-tune my
recent
adjustment of my 79 bus' rear brakes, I managed to actually BREAK off the
end of
my large &quot;heavy-duty&quot; Craftsman screwdriver while trying to turn one of the
stubborn adjustment stars --  and the last half-inch or so of the driver
blade
fell inside the brake drum through the adjustment hole, and remains there.
Typical gotcha, for me.  I don't know how far down inside it fell --
haven't
been able to see it.  I was thinking of trying to get some kind of
telescopic/
flexible magnet thing to try to fish it out with thru the hole -- but feel
like
this is a long shot.  I was wondering if anyone has any ideas/advice as to
how I
might get this thing out (i.e. does the drum have to come off in order to
access
its insides or can I get to it another way?), or whether I even need to --
the
piece is fairly small, but it still doesn't seem too prudent leaving
something
like that in there.  Any ideas/assistance from anyone would be greatly
appreciated!
