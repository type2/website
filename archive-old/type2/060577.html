Your '70 has hardened valve seats from the factory (or the nth
rebuild) so you don't have to worry about lead additives.

There are additives, but they don't contain lead in any useful
quantities.  The reason is that tetraethyl lead is a rather nasty
poison so it isn't available to you and me.

If you really _need_ some lead in your gas (say, to keep that 36hp
engine you found pickled happy) all you have to do is head to the
nearest airport.  Even the supposed &quot;100LL&quot; low lead avgas has plenty
of lead to keep your valves lubricated.  Don't try to run straight
avgas, though, as its low volitility will cause hard starting.  If you
put a gallon or so in with every tank it will provide the needed lead.
