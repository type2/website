Subject: Re: Speed-O-meter cable ('66 Westfalia)

How heck do I remove speedometer cable from the dashboard? I looked at 
the left front wheel, where the speedometer cable attached to the axel. I 
tried to removed, I cant. Is there another solution for it?

unclip the clip from the cable where it goes through the axle nut cover. you
 then pull the cable through from under the bus.    try W-D 40?  pry off the
dust cover and push it through?    

the cable unscrews from the back of the speedo and you pull it out from
between the dash and the package tray.

hope this helps
