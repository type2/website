Subject: 20 minutes 2 busses in phoenix 2 kewl!

ok, most days i am the only bus on the road in the NE phoenix area... 
i sometimes see a late bay in north scottsdale, and in south 
scottsdale a late bay is often parked near a fabric store (this 
doesn't include the 4 non-runners i see in backyards!).
however, today i saw TWO early bays within a 1/2-an-hour, in the same 
general area. it was practically a caravan!  :)
first was a white hardtop on cactus with a blue ladder strapped to 
the top; later on shea was a green  69 panel van converted to some 
sort of camper... shore plug, hacked-in wiindows and a skylight. was 
about the closest to an authentic delta green repaint i've ever seen, 
too.

sorry if this seems ho-hum to listees in CA or OR, but in the land of 
escalades, H2s (FUH2!) and monster pickups, it was like crusoe seeing 
footprints on the beach.................
