Subject: Re:  EveryBus 2002 Thanks

Hi Steve,
I was wondering if you would mind if someone videotaped the seminar also?
Maybe redistribute with funds from copies going to T2 list.  Just a
thought...As I was watching you this weekend I was thinking it would be
great for others to hear this.

It was a pleasure meeting you again...

To all the non-Moonies (I already thanked the Moonies) that donated food and
helped out at breakfast .. Thank you for your help...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy

&gt; &gt; EB02 is over.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There were well over 160 VW Transporters in attendance and one very
&gt; &gt; COOL MB Marco Polo Westfalia conversion with German registration and
&gt; &gt; plates.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks are in order for:
&gt;
&gt; CHRIS CYBULSKI!!!!!!  Who ran a GREAT event!!!!  Hip Hip HOORAY!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve Dolan for checking the dwell and timing on more poorly running
&gt; &gt; buses than could keep count of and the space on the everybus server.
&gt;
&gt; Yah, yah... I was just havin' fun :-)  I *would* like to hear from those
&gt; whose buses I worked on... did you get home OK?
&gt;
&gt; And the feeble, last minute efforts I made on Saturday have inspired
&gt; me...  At High Country Bus Festival (with permission from Mike/Buddha), I
&gt; would like to run a formal clinic on &quot;How to set your dwell, timing, and
&gt; check your vacuum&quot;  I will post further on this tomorrow, as it is closing
&gt; in on 3AM and I just got home and am near-delirious form exhaustion.
&gt;
&gt; I have some ideas, some questions, and would like to recruit some
&gt; victi/////...  err... volunteers :-) on running a basic &quot;keep your bus
&gt; engine alive&quot; seminar.
&gt;
&gt; I would also like to collect some old distributors and carbs, as examples
&gt; and teaching tools.  At the very least, if you are coming to HCBF, plan on
&gt; scooping all the old distributors and carbs, dead or not, out of your
&gt; parts boxes.  Maybe we can line up for an ID and diagnosis session....
&gt; what is it?  what is it good for? and how does it do what it is supposed
&gt; to do?
&gt;
&gt; Anyhow, it is late... errr... early, and I am collapsing as I typ(o)e....
&gt; excuse the lousy keyboard work :-)  I'll post something more readable
&gt; tomorrow, I promise!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Nikki for almost getting there.
&gt;
&gt; :-( But she *is* on her way, thanks to Art Long and David Schwarze! :-)
&gt; The latest news is that she is headed east after a carb clinic by David
&gt; Schwarze.  Speaking of which... David...  coming to HCBF?  Wanna run a
&gt; clinic on carbs????  Or anyone (oh, say...  Mr. Dearing :-) want to sub?
&gt; I am OK on FI, but you can search the archives in vain for posts by me on
&gt; carbs!  I am hopeless on them and would love to attend a seminar on them
&gt; at a campout.
