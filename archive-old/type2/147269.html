Subject: CA Smog

Karl is correct, as always, and baiting him is just rude.  Yes, you as 
the BUYER can choose NOT to hold the seller responsible for the smog 
cert, but as a SELLER, if the buyer doesn't agree to that, you're sunk. 
  DMV will take your money and give you receipts (so you can avoid 
penalties based on transfer time limits) , but the title doesn't really 
transfer until the process is complete.  If your reg is due, you get no 
new tags until the cert is produced.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verbatim:

(http://www.dmv_dot_ca_dot_gov/vr/smogfaq.htm)
If a smog certification is required and you have not had a smog 
inspection, you may still pay your registration fees to avoid any late 
fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year 
sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV.

(http://www.dmv_dot_ca_dot_gov/vr/smogfaq.htm)
When a car is sold, who is responsible for the inspection?

The seller is required to provide the buyer with a valid smog inspection 
certification at the time of the sale or transfer. Smog certifications 
are good for 90 days from the date of issuance.

The inspection is not required on a transfer if a biennial smog 
certification was submitted to DMV within 90 days prior to the vehicle 
transfer date (a vehicle inspection report may be required for proof of 
certification).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a buyer, I take advantage of the current CA law to ensure that I 
haven't bought a total POS by asserting my right to have a current smog 
cert included in any vehicle purchase.  Ditto on clean title.  Either of 
these problems can be a major headache to a buyer and while I may not be 
happy with DMV on other issues, this one absolutely protects the buyer. 
  Of course if there is another buyer who is willing to forfeit their 
rights, it's hard to force a seller of a POS to comply.

&gt;BAD and WRONG information!!!
&gt;NO way NO how can you transfer ownership
without it!

Sorry Karl,

I have bought multiple vehicles in California from private sellers
&quot;AS-IS&quot; without Smog certificates.   Have you?
