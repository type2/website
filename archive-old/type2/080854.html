I just put a set of Yokohama 356 tires on the Vanagon.  What a huge =
difference good tires make.  I've only put about 200 miles on them so =
far but I really like them.  They are 195/75/14 with a load range D.  =
Plus, they say &quot;Super Van 356&quot; on the side!!!  BTW I got them at Tire =
Rack for $60 or $69.
