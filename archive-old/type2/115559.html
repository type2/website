Subject: Funny noises in my Distributor

Today I finished replacing all my vacuum hoses, hoping that it was a cause for
a serious hesitation and convulsions during acceleration. But now...My
distributor is making noises  that I can only describe as either a fan belt or
power steering gone bad when they begin to screech. My dwell is at a perfect
47 and recently have installed new points/condensor. Does anybody know what is
making that screech?
