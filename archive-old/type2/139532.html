Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

The pressure plate has to match the tranny input shaft and TO bearing. I do
not know the years for changes to the tranny, I thought it was '71. But a
&quot;sleeve&quot; was added around the input shaft for the TO bearing to ride on to
help keep it centered. Your '71 probably has this.

You need the TO bearing and pressure plate designed to use that sleeve --
or not, depending on whether it is there or not.
