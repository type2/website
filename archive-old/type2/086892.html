&gt; The Grand Tetons are, however, not for people in VW buses :-)  At the very
&gt; least, do *not* be tempted by Rt. 22 coming out!  It is the *steepest*
&gt; road I have ever been on!!!  the SUVs were in 2nd!  I agree that it is
&gt; among the most beautiful places on earth, but it is also among the most
&gt; abrupt.  do it if you want, but an oil temp gauge should be required,
&gt; like chains in the passes in the winter.  No gauge, no go.

well I would rate CO Route 550 between Durango and Oray, 15mph speed limit
strictly enforced by the side of the road!!!  coming out of Silverton
headed East passed a sign saying Summit 9miles, height this point
10,000ft!!
   my poor 65Westy just about got to the top in 2nd gear
