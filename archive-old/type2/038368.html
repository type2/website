Subject: Help, I can't get my 71 Westy to idle!

Thanks to everyone who responded to my original message.  I finally managed
to get her to idle after re-rebuilding the carb and installing new brake
vacuum assist hose and check valve.  Also installed all new vacuum hoses.
Now, I just need to make my brakes work, i.e. bleed them and go over them.
I purchased my Westy off an old lady who had it sitting in her back yard for
ten years (her husband became ill) and it shouldn't be long until it is road
worthy.  Have not found a name for her yet.  Need a new pop top too.  The
fiberglass fibers are showing through.  Anybody restored these before?  Is
it better to just find one from the list or yard?  Thanks to all who helped
again : )
