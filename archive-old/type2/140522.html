Subject: Re: [T2] Starter won't turn over with key

Install a Bosch WR-1 low-voltage relay kit:

I installed this on my '79 bus many years ago, after having to push start it 
by myself several times (not easy!) when the engine got very warm on a long 
trip through the Pacific Northwest.

Install a points replacement unit, e.g., Pertronix Ignitor or Compu-Fire, a 
fresh Bosch Blue coil or equivalent and set the timing with a timing light 
so that it's spot-on and the engine will leap to life every time with the 
slightest turn of the key.
