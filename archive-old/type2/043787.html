    hi dad i was writing to say hi. and everyone else hi also

this place is very hot and humid we work at DAMMAM port 

it is where the US troops set up all there army stuff at.  this

place is very unique the arabs don't work none they think they 

are to good to work.  they also get money for free don't ask me

one thing i noticed is that the other people are very polite 

and do anything you ask no questions asked.  i also find that

comunicating with the people is very hard. i have to use body

language or if i can find the translator i can use him but everything 

is so slow due to the language difference. i aslo lost my wallet i was 

wondering if heather could cancel my atm/debt card just in case

someone finds it and trys to use it. i'm also going to try and 

visit egupt or some other cool place for a few days on my way home

which i don't see comeing for at least a couple mounths or more.

if you get this right afer i send it to you write me back. you can send

a letter to this address anytime. now i'm not sure whether or not the 

address will show up or not and if it dosen't i'll write to you and give 

it to you. i'm just wondering what the latest news is about warren?

tell everyone i love them and would you tell mom i love her and miss her.

 love DARRELL
