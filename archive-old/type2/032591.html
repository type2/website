Hi Chris - 

Earlier, you frantically typed:

&lt;Yikes!  The GL5 has been in the tranny about 400 miles and 12 days. Is
this long
&lt;enough to do damage?

Fret Not!  You're not even  _close_  to etching/destroying parts.  Bus
trannies, if cared for, live a long, long time.  (Light torque loads, ya
know...)  400 miles is a 'spit in the bucket'.  

&gt;What of the multi rated oils that are GL4/GL5?

GL4 comes in 85W90, 90, and 90W140.  The 85/90 stuff works well here in
East Texas; low drag when cold, great protection on those hot summer
days.

&lt;If I drain the tranny and add the GL4 with that be enough to remove the
&lt;offending chemical? 

Yup.  No sweat.  Do it after a good drive (20 minutes or so), so that the
oil is good and warm and flows out easily.  Leave the tranny drain plug
out until the drips stop - you've got somethin' else to do, right?  Pop
the plug back in and refill with the  _GL4_  gear oil of your choice! 
You haven't damaged anything, and your tranny will be happy!
