Subject: 71 camper stool

Since its Friday,

I wanted to publically thank Jeff from Phoenix and his wife for helping me 
out.  I've been looking for a 71 yellow vinyl stool for a couple of months 
and  they are sorta hard to find. Jeff had one in his garage.  it was a very 
generous deal and I just wanted to show my great appreciation for the new 
addition to my bus!!

Thanks again Jeff!  and to this list for its wide variety of resources and 
the list admins for their unselfish amount of time they give for the love of 
the volkswagen.

PS:  In Search a tent for 71 camper???-thats a longshot huh?

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
