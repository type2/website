Subject: Re: Westfalia (and other) side tents...(useability).

&gt; Well, I've camped in a lot of places, mostly around the west but some
&gt; places across the country to the east coast (I'm talking United States
here).
&gt; Generally, I've found the campgrounds to be in better condition than the
ones
&gt; Fred describes but I agree that in a large percentage of the cases, a
&gt; Westy tent wouldn't be very useful. 

My experience has been quite the opposite.  Evon and I have used the tent
for our '89 Westy (and before that, the tent for our departed '77 Westy) to
the fullest.  In both state parks and the various music fests that we like
to travel to over the summer, if we're there for more than a night we set
up the tent.  The main advantages are that it gives us a &quot;place to put our
stuff&quot; while clearing out the Westy to make it a living space, and a larger
area to hang out if it's raining and we're staying under cover. Considering
that the Westy interior is already a high-traffic area serving as our
&quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bedroom,&quot; it helps to also have a semi-detached &quot;living
room&quot; if there are a few visitors around, or if we have inclement weather. 
Plus if we leave our site we can leave the tent behind to save our spot. 
On the other hand, for overnight stays in one place (where we wouldn't be
spending time at the campsite) it's not worth the hassle.  Now that our
first child is on the way (in 2-3 weeks!!), we expect to use the tent as an
area to put the collapsable crib/playpen, etc. so that the baby will be
nearby but protected from the elements when we are at the campsite.
