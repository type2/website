Subject: [T2] The Hubcap Arrives...

Hi Volks,

Just dropping a line to let y'all know that the hubcap is  safe and sound
here in Scarborough Ontario; Canada. I picked it up from the Denmeister in
Erin, we chatted for a while and home it came. There's a picture of the
hand-off at

Das Über-Kamper is now sporting a fresh coat of rattle-can primer, and looks
better than ever. I've primed the nose, the passenger side and the tail, but
I have run out of paint, and I'm not sure if I'll have time to get it
finished before the carabus to Grand Bend Ontario for the VW drag races this
weekend. If anyone want to see the hubcap this weekend, just look for the
battle-ship grey day camper with jalousie's, that'll be me. I intend to
hand off to Jeff from Kingston this weekend, where it goes from there is not
yet known.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
