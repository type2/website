Subject: Electrical Problem/Dead Bus

Hi-
I'm three weeks new to the list and three weeks new to my '73 bus.  And
I've already got problems.
The bus ran great from the day I picked it up.  Except that it took a bit
of cranking to get the engine to start.  Turn the key and the starter
cranks for about 5-15 seconds, and then bam the engine starts up no
problem.  Then after running for a while, it will start up right away.
After waiting ~ five hours, same problem comes back again.
So I couldn't decide if it was electrical or related to the engine being
warm.  

THEN I noticed that the Gen light was flikering on SOMETIMES, but not
always.  Not related to RPM, just the phase of the moon.  But once it
started to flicker, it would continue to flicker.
The problem is definately elctrical, I decide!  I'll get a voltometer right
away and check things out.
BUT before I can do so, I drive the bus to a halloween party, and on the
way home I drop some people off, turning off the bus, but leaving the
lights on for about one minute.  
Click.
No start.  Lights, but no turning over at all.  I get a push start.  
Two miles down the road, engine quits.  While coasting, I turn the key,
nothing.  I put it in gear, pop the clutch, nothing.  Coast to a start, no
power at all to anything, not even a click.  Unfortunately, I didn't look
at the dash while I was coasting, so I don't know what lights were on, if any.

I won't go into to the story of two elves (it was halloween remember)
waiting for the tow truck at one in the morning in 30 degree Cambridge.

My diagnoses:
Bad regulator or alternator.  Battery was getting charged, but poorly.
Then, on the fateful night, reg. or alt. died, and I was running purely on
battery.  Eventually of course it died.

Thoughts?  I am going to buy a volt-meter this afternoon and check things
out.  And I will charge the battery, and see what happens.  It's just that
this doesn't seem to match anything I've read in the books or in the archives.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.
