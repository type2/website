Subject: [T2] 83 Westy engine identification and extra books



&gt; I just purchased an 83 westy and I am having trouble
&gt; finding good information on the engine.  Per the
&gt; library, I found that the CV stamped on my crank is
&gt; correct for that year, a 2.0L.  However, when I go to
&gt; the parts store, they ask me if I have a 1.9L or a 2L.
&gt;  Is there any way to tell if it is a 1.9 such as a
&gt; marking or distinct characteristic?

As you know, the Vanagon switched over from an air-cooled engine (2 litre,
actually 1970cc's) to water-cooled during the 1983 model year.  If your
Vanagon is air-cooled, it should have engine code letters &quot;CV&quot; stamped on
the case right near the oil breather.  You have the &quot;2L&quot; engine.

&gt;
&gt; Also, I have the haynes manual for an 80-83 air cooled
&gt; vanagon.  Although much of the book is useful, the
&gt; engine in the book does not look the same as the
&gt; engine in my car.  Most notable is the book has the
&gt; air filter directly over the center of the engine,
&gt; while my engine has the airfilter to the far right of
&gt; the engine compartment. Is there a book that has a
&gt; more specific slant toward the engine that I have?

This book actually has complete information for your vehicle, but it also
has information about Europe-only vehicles that don't apply to your car.
When reading the manual you'll need to keep track of whether it's talking
about USA or Europe models.  The &quot;Volkswagen Vanagon Official Factory Repair
Manual&quot; published by Bentley covers your vehicle, as well as all other
&quot;flavors&quot; of Vanagons produced.  The best manual out there, in my opinion,
for a novice mechanic is the Clymer &quot;VW Vanagon&quot; manual; it's specific to
USA air-cooled Vanagons and has step-by-step proceedures, where the Bentley
generally doesn't since it's mainly a referance manual for VW mechanics.
Frankly, I have all 3 manuals and sometimes refer to them all!

&gt;
&gt; Finally, where would be the best place to get a hotter
&gt; bosch coil, the sites recommended don't offer the
&gt; hotter red and black coil.

Why would you want a &quot;hotter&quot; coil?  The standard coil provides sufficient
spark to ignite a proper fuel mixture in a mechanically-sound engine and
there's nothing to be gained (and $'s to be lost) by changing the coil.
