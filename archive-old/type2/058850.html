Subject: Rear stub axles/bearings OUT!

I posted last week that I couldn't get the stub axles out on my 71; what
I needed was a bigger hammer.  They're out now, and I pulled the rear
wheel bearings &amp; brought em home for a cleanup and look-see.

FWIW the outer bearings, while harder to pound out than the inner ones,
seem to have survived removal well, despite what Haynes says.

Sequence:
1. remove inner grease seal and snap-ring.  I use circlip pliers to
compress the circlip where I can get a screwdriver under one end of it,
then lever it out of the groove from that end.  I've had no luck simply
compressing the ring and pulling it out - it pops off the pliers (I
tried this for over an hour once).
2. remove outer grease seal and outer bearing's inner race.
3. from outside, pound out inner bearing.  Your punch is hitting the
inner race of this bearing, so be careful.  Messy and a pain because the
spacer tube (inside) flops around - you have to move it to see the race.
4. remove spacer ring from inside, then wipe out as much grease as you
can with paper towels.
5. from inside, pound out outer bearing.
6. get neck massage.

It's a good idea to put something under it to catch the bearings when
they come out.  One of mine fell in that nasty red South GA dirt, but no
biggie since they're due to be cleaned.

I also removed all the brake components for R&amp;R.  The left rear wheel
cyl was leaking.

So far I cannot get the right brake backing plate off.  The star wheel
housing has a pin that goes thru the plate and into the bearing housing,
and said pin is resisting my bigger-hammer-pounding.  I sprayed it with
some penetrant and will try again later.

I plan to replace the grease seals, wheel cylinders, and shoes. 
Bearings, too, if necessary.  Will clean and repaint the backing
plate(s).
