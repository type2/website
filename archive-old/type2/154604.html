Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Westy Bed Brackets

Hi Don,

You might want to specify what year you are looking for. The 68-73  
brackets have the cabinet on the right side of the bus. 74-75 are  
full width. 79-79 are &quot;cabinet on the left&quot;.

Converting a set of 68-73 or 76-79 brackets to work as a full width  
is possible, but it will take some reworking of the brackets as only  
one side of the set are designed to fit over the wheel well. I did it  
for my westfakia; it took a bit of finesse with a large vice and a  
BFH before I got it sitting where I wanted it.

One question for Ron: will these work in a Vanagon??   We have a  
sunroof van here that needs to be camperized.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
