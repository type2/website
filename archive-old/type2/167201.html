Subject: RE: [T2] HALLALUH!!! SING!!!

Good on ya Bob! It's always a relief when things come together.

Last week I started reassembling my engine. It's been on the shelf for the 
past year awaiting a camshaft. Put the case together with cam and crank in 
place only to find that I lost the cam plug and neglected to order a new 
one. So I ordered a new plug and was gonna put it all together this week. 
Instead? I end up having to replace the head gasket and rear main seal in 
our Plymouth Voyager. Sheesh!

But all is good. I am a middle school teacher and have the summer off to 
dedicate to wrenchin'.

and yes. The list has pulled my head out more than a few times!
