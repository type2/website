Subject: Re: [T2] Late Type 4 Crank

The late crank is not counterbalanced.  Counterbalanced cranks are for racing, really, because it doesn't really do much below 5000 rpm.  They are available, though. You should check shoptalkforums_dot_com for sourcing...I think DPR makes one.  For a bus or aircooled vanagon, I think just balancing the crank would be sufficient, because low end power is needed more to get the heavy thing moving.
