Subject: Re: [T2] revitalizing rubber door seals



&gt;I checked the archives and there didn't seem to be any 'generally
&gt;recommended' product or method for revitalizing the seal.  I wondered if
&gt;anyone head any profound successes at this.  The best advice I found was
&gt;coating it in a thin layer of silicone.  Any particular brand or type that
&gt;works best?

Landon,
I took the plunge fives months ago and bought some of the Zymol seal
conditioner.  Kinda pricey but most of my window seals were in good 
shape and didn't need replacing(doors and other openings are another
story).  It's made of what seems to be glycerin and natural oils and 
smells like coconuts.  Works really well if the rubber is not to far 
gone.  However, I suspect that with your own similar ingredients you
could come up with something pretty close.  The instructions say to 
to apply in one direction only...I'm not sure why.  I found it worked
better with 2 or 3 applications.  Old rubber ya know :)

As a side note,  there was a Zymol brochure with the bottle and their
most expensive wax was about $1500.00 for 6 oz.  I just started 
laughing.
