Subject: Don't cut a hole for the sender!

It is not really neccessary to cut an access hole for the fuel sender.
I replaced mine in my '78 (with factory FI intact-might not be able to do 
this on a carburetted engine)  a few years ago by removing the screws from 
the firewall and tilting it back onto the engine, then I was able to R&amp;R the 
sending unit without cutting a hole. I used a screwdriver tip (like for 
drill/drivers) and a small wrench (1/4&quot;?) to remove the screws.  There was 
just enough room to get the sender out and then the new one in.  Same deal to 
replace the screws.  
Might be worth a try.  It worked for me.
I just can't bear to cut or drill non original holes on a vehicle that I'm 
going to keep.
