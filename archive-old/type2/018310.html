&gt; &gt; ok ok I know that original German is better than Brazilian...but I'm

&gt; &gt; I need a new muffler and was going to order it from Bus Depot and try
&gt; &gt; them out ....here's your chance to grab a repeat customer Mr.
&gt; &gt; BusDepot..... and they have a Brazilian one for sale....obviousely the
&gt; &gt; wouldn't sell something that wouldn't work so....
&gt; &gt; What is the big difference between the 2 and how long will each

&gt; There is absolutely no reason, even monitary, that should induce you
&gt; to put yourself through the torture that a Brazilian muffler will
&gt; give.  While there may be good mufflers from Brazil (VW do Brasil
&gt; wouldn't buy such bad ones, would they?) I haven't seen them in the
&gt; US.  Cheap tends to push out good.  The additional $30 or so that you
&gt; pay for the Liestirtz muffler will be repaid in the parts you _don't_
&gt; break while trying to bend things around to fit the new muffler.  If
&gt; you have to, patch the old one with muffler bandage until you have the
&gt; coin for the good muffler.

George:
That's two good ideas! 
In the rust belt where Isaiah (and I) live a Brazillian muffler probably
won't even last from now till Christmas, not to mention the hell of
installing it.
