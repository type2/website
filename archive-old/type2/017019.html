Hello all-   I've been reading the various posts for the last week with much interest.
Having just spent the last ~4 months reviving my 76 westy &quot;Bullwinkle&quot; , which hadn't
been operated since '90 (wouldn't pass CA smog and the previous owner couldn't afford to
fix it), I must comment on a similar problem that I discovered w/ the clutch.  The clutch
plate had frozen to the flywheel, however, the transmission was in neutral and it wasn't
until after I'd completed a lot of replacement work (W/O PULLING THE ENG.), that I
discovered this problem.  The solution was to pull the engine and replace the oily/rusted
parts.  Apparently the previous owner had a new clutch disk installed but did not replace
the Eng. and transmission seals.  Oil had managed to leak all over the disk rendering it
unusable, and with the passage of time firmly locked the disk to the flywheel/pressure
plate.  Unfortunately the oil soaked disk was trash (almost stock thickness).
    A comment concerning a different subject: the catalytic heater.  I have used one of
the small Olympian heaters quite successfully in a tent trailer in the winter (snow in
Yosemite).  The heater is flame less and will warm a small space  (like the bus) fairly
well, HOWEVER, you must be certain to provide a source of fresh air for you to breath, as
indeed CO2 and H2O are byproducts of the heater (no CO is produced so it's ok to use
indoors etc).  I also WOULD NOT drive with the heater operating as the propane tank would
be open and very dangerous in an accident just like Bob pointed out.   Probably better to
purchase a heater designed for operation in a moving car....
    A comment concerning seat belts.   I replaced &quot;Bullwinkle's&quot; belts with retractable
units out of a 86 vanagon and they work GREAT.  Having belts that move with you when you
lean forward etc... is so much better than the original belts it's worth the effort to
install them.  I spent about 3 hr. total (you need to locate and anchor the belt
retractor units behind the front seats).  The passenger side went quickly,  however I
ended up having to fabricate a bracket to attach the retractor on the driver side belt (I
had to do this because I replaced the sink unit w/ a rear facing single seat from the
same  86 vanagon.  The sink unit is modular and can be reinstalled with out too much
trouble for long trips, but for now the extra seat is more to my needs).
    I replaced the stock points w/ the electronic unit made by Pertronix,  and have
nothing but praise for this product and company.  The timing and advance stay dead on,
no problems w/ the dwell shifting etc...I'm using the stock coil and get good results.
By the way, when I reinstalled the engine after replacing the clutch, I managed to
reverse the wires to the elect. ign and totally fried the input transistor.  I called
Perrtronix hoping to purchase a replacement part, explaining my bonehead mistake,  well
they said send the part to them for inspection and guess what?  They sent me a new unit
NO CHARGE! This is the type of service that keeps me coming back - I wish more companies
treated customers this way.
Hope these comments are of use , just my .02+ worth.   Chris

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pushed the clutch to the floor, you WERE able to start the bus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; yes?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, but, since it was in Reverse, it lurched backward and died immediately.  I can
&gt; &gt; push the clutch pedal to the floor, it doesn't resist, and it does no clutching
&gt; &gt; function.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, the clutch is NOT the culprit here.  Transmission related.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to start the bus, and all it did was try to move (ie: clutch did not
&gt; &gt; &gt; disengage when pushed...) then I would look at either a frozen clutch
&gt; &gt; &gt; plate, or cable problems, etc..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; another check would be to just push the clutch in. No brake. Nose is
&gt; &gt; &gt; downhill, right?  The bus should start rolling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No roll.  It used to be that I could sort of feel the clutch pedal resist and then
&gt; &gt; like something was engaging.  That doesn't happen now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No? But you can start the
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, I can start the engine, but then it instantly dies since it's stuck in
&gt; &gt; Reverse.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tranny.  Cant start the engine? clutch. (or both..)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Uh... poop.  Now I know why Previous Owners are the target of such ridicule.  I
&gt; &gt; probably need a new transmission, then?  That's like the cost of just buying a bus
&gt; &gt; that works in the first place, right?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; --
&gt; Brian:
&gt; I think your clutch isn't releasing for one of 2 reasons:
&gt; 1. Broken clutch cable
&gt; 2. Broken welds on clutch release shaft.(Pedal moves, cable moves, has
&gt; slight resistance because of the spring on the release lever, but
&gt; because the throwout bearing is not pushing the clutch fingers in you
&gt; don't feel much resistance and the clutch does not disengage.) This is a
&gt; lot more work to fix than just the cable because it involves taking out
&gt; the engine to get to the shaft, but it's not as bad as fixing the
&gt; transmission.
