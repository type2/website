Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Ah Ha! BN4 placement

Hi all,

I've sent some pics off to Rob Henley at http://www.72camper_dot_com so
hopefully we'll see them there in the future. I'm certainly willing to take
more if there is interest (and somewhere to place them on the net for the
benefit of other listees.)

Rick, if you want the ones I just took p-mailed, I've got two .zip files at
approx 5 Meg each. Let me know if your mail system can handle them and I'll
send them over...

Regards,

John B.

photographer, so what you see is what you get and the best I can do.  :-)

I know that I'd love to see some pictures of this. I'm installing a BN4 in 
my '72 this summer.

&gt;do not go through the tin. They go through the &quot;floor&quot; area directly
&gt;underneath. My heater is removed at present so if it would help, I would be
&gt;happy to take some digital pictures of the area (with exhaust locations and
&gt;such) and mail them to you. Let me know...
