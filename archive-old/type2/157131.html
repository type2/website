Subject: Spring Rates / convert to air?

Somewhere several years ago, I saw a listing of
torsion bar spring rates. Can anybody lead me to that?

I want to compare stock spring rates for my '79 bus
vs. my '74 bus. Maybe they're the same / maybe not.
Also have had a longtime interest in the possibility
of converting to air suspension. Back would be easy...
Kinda neat to pull into the camping spot and lower the
suspension to the stops. Discussion welcome. -BaH
