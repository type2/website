&gt;Compression test came out ok on my troubled engine:  107, 116, 105, 112.

Once I found an obstructed intake manifold on an engine that was acting like
yours.
The pop-off valve from a previously replaced air flow meter was wedged in
the intake.
It was incredibly time-consuming to diagnose and I felt really great when I
finally found it.
Good Luck,
Steve Elms
