Subject: [T2] Source for parts washer stands (cheap ones)?

OK, have spent 2 days trying to locate one of those $105 parts washing 
stands (Tiwanese?) in central Fla..NO ONE seems to carry them..though every 
parts store in our tiny NC town has them. Could not find on Harbor freight 
or JCWhipme sites either. Any ideas? (Copy to me please, as we're on 
digest.)

Thanks...dirty Marv...
