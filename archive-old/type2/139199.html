Subject: RE: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

Wayne,

From my '79 owner's manual, page 34, recommended speed ranges for various
gears lists
&quot;4th gear from 30 mph or 48 km/h up.&quot;
and goes on to say
&quot;A governor is installed on the engine to prevent damage from excessive
engine speed (revolutions per minute).&quot;
and page 83,
&quot;Maximum and cruising speed 75 mph or 120 km/h&quot;

There is no listing for engine redline in RPMs.

Carb engines don't have the electronic engine management that the FI systems
do. The FI system limits the RPMs not because of fuel delivery capacities
but because they are programmed to.

&gt; From: Wayne [mailto:mga60_at_optonline_dot_net]
&gt; OK, here are some questions that would help me better understand the 55mph
&gt; limit (particularly for my '79 bus):

&gt; 1: What is the recommended redline for bus engine?
&gt;
&gt; 2: What is the recommended highest cruising rpm?
&gt;
&gt; 3: Why would a FI bus have a lower cruising speed than a carb bus?
