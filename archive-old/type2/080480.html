Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

I have a very accurate sense of smell, and am sure I noticed that MMO
smells just like the oil used for lubing air tools (jack oil?) and they
smell exactly alike, with the same reddish color!  I'm sure kerosene is
in there......maybe some xylene, as that is a common solvent for cutting
contamination.  As an ex biologist/histologist, I shudder at the
tolulene, benzene, xylene, and acetone I've handled, much of it
carcinogenic.

&gt; MMO is really just a solvent mixed with oil.  The solvent can be good for
&gt; things like stuck lifters, but you have to balance that with its possible
&gt; negative effects on other parts of an engine.  It will loosen sludge from
&gt; engine surfaces just as well as it cleans it from the lifters, so unless
&gt; you change the oil filter promptly it can cause big problems.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know why MMO has escaped &quot;snake oil&quot; reputation, but for some
&gt; reason it is now a mainstream product.  It has a purpose, but it isn't
&gt; magic by any means!

&gt; &gt; Seems like paint thinner was $2 a gallon last I bought some at Home Depot. Should
&gt; &gt; I add a pint sortly before changing my oil? (gotta get my 40w out any day now!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one that works extremely well.
