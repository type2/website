Subject: oil cooler on a aircool engine

Hi guys ,
I am about to buy a rebuild 2000cc aircool engine for a 1983 vanagon.
I would like your opinion on the following:
1) How bad is the engine heat when driving in the desert in summer time 
(.i.e Death Valley)
2) I saw some oil cooler over Internet for $250,
    - How reliable are they ?
    - Are they easy to install ?
    - Are they efficient,  meaning , can I go to Death Valley in summer 
time !!! ;-)
    - Any Brand better than others ?
3) Do you have any other tricks to cool down the engine like adding an 
extra fan  ?

Thanks for all your answers.

Chris
