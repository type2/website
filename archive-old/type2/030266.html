&gt; '71 bus
&gt; pre-71 tranny (has the TO bearing that looks like: -0-  and the 
&gt; retaining clips that are separate from the TO bearing)
&gt; 
&gt; At idle:  clutch in, no sound
&gt; At speeds less than 10-20 mph:  clutch in, no discernible sound
&gt; At speeds above 20 mph:  clutch in results in high pitched whine sound 
&gt; that other VW Techs have confirmed
&gt; 						(upon hearing it) sounds like the typical 
&gt; noise a TO bearing makes when going
&gt; 						south
&gt; 

A throwout problem should be affected by engine RPM and clutch
engagement but not road speed.
I think it must be something else. Its not occuriring to me what would be
affected only by these circumstances though. hmmmmm....
