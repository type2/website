&gt; i have 2 XR700 on person vehicles and several others on customer 
&gt; vehicles. they are extremely reliable, to the point of near-zero failure 
&gt; rate. this is not true for pertronix, which  can and do fail.

I do wonder if a lot of those failures come from people hooking them up 
backwards as I did notice that the Crane has reverse polarity protection 
- I'd venture to guess that the Pertronix doesn't.  I've got a Compufire 
so I can't speak about Pertronix, yet the Compufire has been rock-solid. 
  Still, does that warrant twice the price for something that doesn't 
really have any extra features and is a more complicated installation?
