Subject: Re: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

yes getting fluid out of all of them.....
   
  ok so maybe i spoke to soon....
   
  heres a update.... i went to the store and tried to pump the brakes and on every 5th pump i got decent brakes and on the 6th pump i got great brakes...
   
  sooooo does this mean that i dont have the air out yet..??
   
  maybe i should get a bigger bottle of brake fluid in the morning and start over again... ;)
   
  thanks

&gt;i have installed new master cylindr and got all air out of brake 
&gt;lines and my pedaL Is still just as soft as before but at least i 
&gt;can feel my front brakes grab now.... before i couldnt feel that...
&gt;
&gt;i used a whole big bottle of brake fluid up also...
&gt;
&gt;the lines dont have air in them now... and my adjustment on the 
&gt;brakes is good.....
&gt;
&gt;the e brake works awesome but the back brakes arent working with the 
&gt;pedal..? pedal is way to soft....

Are you getting fluid out of the back bleeders?
