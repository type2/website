&gt; &gt; Is there an easy way to remove passer side top cylinder cooling tin on a
&gt; &gt; 1600 DP with the engine still in the bus to retorque the cylinder head
&gt; &gt; with out major disassembly. Thanks.

&gt; On the bus I don't know if there is enough room to get the fan shroud
&gt; off without pulling the motor. But the bus engine is also an easy
&gt; removal on the 1600 models..

No way to remove it, as the oil cooler gets in the way and some of the
cylinder tin screws are inaccessable.  Pull the engine and do it the easy
way!
