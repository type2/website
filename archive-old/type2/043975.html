Subject: RE: [T2] AVP was Cleaning the oil cooler...

&gt; Not to rain on your parade, Tom and Dana, but AVP isn't faultless either.
&gt; They seem to think they can build just about everything. I have recently
&gt; seen two repeat AVP long blocks fail for a Mercruiser engine from them.



I deal with AVP regularly and sell their engines.  They're a VW specialist,
and specifically a VW bus engine specalist.  I think you're confusing them
with somebody else.
