Subject: Beatle motor in 70 bus?

Hi everyone, 
            Last weekend I had the motor in my bus blow up. I checked out my 
options and looked at my finances. I found a motor out of a beatle and I was 
just wondering if I could use that in my bus. I am aware that the rear mount 
is different and I found an adapter kit to remedy that problem. I was just 
wondering if all the bug engines were the same? And if not what years can't I 
use? Also I was wondering what modifcations if any need to be made. I am 
short on cash right now because of school starting back up and I am hoping I 
can get away with using this beatle motor. Thanks for your help, also many 
thanks to those who responded to me earlier about my engine choices.
