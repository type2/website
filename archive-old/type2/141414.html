Subject: Re: [T2] 120 connection question

Gary

IMHO, the ground&lt;green&gt; should be attached to the vehicle chassis,, the
neutral&lt;white&gt; should not be,, and neither should the hot wire.&lt;black&gt;

Some people ground the chassis, and the neutral as done in a residence.... and
this is not correct, really won't harm anything,, but might circumvent a GFCi at
a power post, depending on how the ground fault occurs

hello?   HELLO?
damn,, he must have touched the wrong 2 wires..................

----- Original Message ----- 


&gt; I couldn't find this in the archives, or in the tech library so here it
&gt; is.  I was wondering if the 120 plug into the side of my Riviera should
&gt; be grounded to the chassis?
&gt;
&gt; I've heard differing opinions on this, one person even said that if you
&gt; ground the 120 to the chassis it could screw up your vehicle.
&gt;
&gt; So, should it, or shouldn't it be grounded?
