Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  flooring your &quot;motor&quot;, exhaust valve

The floating piston in a hyd lifter is ideally kept in its mid range of 
travel, which I think I measured once as being around 2 mm?  A 
stretching valve would be like adding too many turns to the initial 
adjustment, to the point where it is like a &quot;solid&quot; and may not let the 
valve seat.  I sugg. adusting the hyd every 20,000 mi or so, which will 
give some idea if a lifter requires unusual loosening.
  As to replacing exhausts every 30,000 mi for FI or 50K carb.- mine are 
still running at 245,000 mi!

  With hydraulic, chances are valve will keep on streching

&gt; ... it can also happen that the floating piston in hydraulic lifter get
&gt; stuck and no longer make the proper continuous zero gap adjustment which
&gt; lead to the same problems a badly adjusted mechanical ajusted lifter will
&gt; lead.  Well filtered oil is a must for hydraulic lifters.  Do not be cheap
&gt; on filter changes.
