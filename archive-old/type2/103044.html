&gt;Nice for you, though I do like to hear the engine noise too, so I really don't have any subs and don't turn it up all that loud.

Engine noise can get monotonous on 1,000 mile trips.  I added lots of gauges so that I could feel confident about my engine's general condition without having to hear it, if I choose.  Sometimes it's nice to hear the engine sing while you're cruising the hills of Sedona on a warm evening with the windows down.  Sometimes it's nice to watch the forests of the Ozarks roll by while listening to your favorite tunes on the CD player.  Both are part of the bus-experience for me and I like to be able to choose.

&gt;The stool is shorter front to back than your cabinet, as it stops just in front of the seat belt posts. The lid is hinged such that it flips up to vertical and stops there. It has a pocket on the back of the lid that I keep my registration and insurance card in.

Sometimes I wish I had made the cabinet shorter like yours.  Next time, I might make it shorter and taller.  I kept the height down so it would clear the seatbelt buckles (in fact, they seem to help keep the cabinet in place) with the idea that I could always add an &quot;insert&quot; on top for whatever functionality I needed, like a seat cushion, storage cabinet, etc..  Never got around to making the inserts though.
