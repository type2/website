A big thank you to all who replied.
I haven't unpacked it yet, after the initial surprise of not getting what I expected, I've been proceeding cautiously.
I believe the entire engine is made in Brazil, the &quot;Volkswagen do Brasil Ltda&quot; is very distinct on the outside of the box. Also other &quot;Made In Brazil&quot; notices on the outside. Nothing about Mexico.
Armed w the helpful replies, tomorrow I'll look it over and try to determine if is duel relief and try to answer the questions posed in the replies.
 
Duel relief seems to be the only issue????
No one has mentioned other Mexican/Brazilian quality differences???
Thanks again
Denny
