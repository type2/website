Subject: How to keep a healthy fuel tank??

Hey guys,
 
    I've been reading lots of stuff that suggests people are having problems
with scale rust comming off the inside of the tank and clogging the exit of
the fuel tank. With that in mind, I do know that the tank in my Bus is brand
new (well, about as brand new as a 4 year old tank could be).... how can I
keep it in good shape and prevent the insides from rusting? Do I just need
to keep it filled all the time?
 
 
Thanks,
