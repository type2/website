Howdy,

Someone decided that it was funny to steal the oil cap in my '72 a couple weeks
ago. Well. Upon looking for another one, I found that the local auto suppliers
don't even have listings for '72. It skipps that year. Furthermore, it seems
that most other years use a twist style oil cap and not a screw-on oil cap like
mine was. Why is this? 

Also... I was wondering what the floor in my van should look like. As I got it,
it had wood on top of the metal floor, a mat of some sort on top of the wood,
and a poorly-cut carpet on top of that. What should be there? 

Ah, and while I'm at it, I have a single chair right behind the driver's seat
which is in no way attached to... anything! Was it originally? And how should I
go about fastening it to something? 

Thank you!

The old pool shooter had many a game in his
life. But now it was time to hang up the cue.
When he did, all the other cues came
crashing to the floor. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said with a smile.
