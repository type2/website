&gt; Hi Volks- I am running a separate circuit for my accessories and need to
&gt; know the best size and type of wire to run from the back of the bus forward.

it's worth mentioning here that some of the bay window fuse boxes 
(1971, for example) have an unused/accessories fuse position.  For some 
reason I want to say it's #8 or #9 on the '71.  

As a result, you can run your accessories line through a fuse (always a 
smart idea) without having to modify anything.

cheers,
