Subject: Anyone know anything about Day Campers?

http://seattle.craigslist_dot_org/car/84772834.html
 Hey hey, can ya'll take a look at this link and tell me what you know of
this sort of camper? And any potential trouble I should be looking for? It's
cheap enough to easily fit in my budget, with a little left over for fix it
upper stuff. I think I can get access to pretty much a full woodshop (I'm
MUCH better with wood than with metal) so repair of cabnets isn't a major
concern. I'm thinking to get this bus for my camping, and keep my current
bus and maybe take baby steps (yeah, &quot;what about bob&quot; is on TV) towards
fixing it up. Put POR15 on the rust for now until I can wrap my head around
all that welding.
 Anyway, I'm gonna go take a look at it when I get off work in the morning
at 7:00 am pacific time, so if anyone could reply before then, that would be
GGRrrreat!
 The above link has pictures for you to look at and say &quot;So THAT'S what he's
talking about!!&quot; Just please nobody rush out and buy it before me. Lol
 From the pcitures it looks more like my level of restoration would be
involved.
 Thanks in advance
Chris
