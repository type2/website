i recently found that hidden engine number and turns out my '77 is powered by a type IV EB 003 847-- much to my surprise.  Anyway, according to Muir this is a aug. 72 1679cc engine-- what do I strobe time this to (the chart on page 111 is unclear)?
Also, it has a 009 distributer in it that won't fit with the notch towards the rear of the engine, so I went ahead and set the valves at 0 tdc, 180 degrees from the notch, rotor pointed to the rear-- is this correct or stupid?
thanks a lot,
