Subject: CV joint bolts

To avoid stripping CV joint bolts I take a bit of extra time and clean out
the the allen holes as well as I can with a needle tool and lots of wd-40
and make sure the allen tool is completely inserted before applying force.
If I get too much resistance I clamp on the outside with a medium sized vice
grip and turn using both tools at once.  The vice grip alone has always
worked for me as a last ditch.
