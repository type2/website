Subject: Bus Speakers

Well, just for a little more &quot;ambiguity&quot;, on the Bus speaker issues...... I
was at a &quot;tin scrap yard&quot; awhile back and bought some &quot;pieces&quot; of round thin
wall, (like stove pipe), and some 90 &quot;elbows&quot;, and &quot;crudely&quot; mounted my
speakers from left side and right side front, to meet in the middle with an
adjustable total diameter, &quot;flapper&quot; valve, and I was impressed, (note, I)
Seems it makes a &quot;sound chamber&quot;, and I liked it, but will have to get back to
it, when I can!!  (JFFT)
