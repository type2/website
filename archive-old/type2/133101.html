Subject: Re: [T2] mattress

Corbett,

Did this on a 67 split years ago.  Had a roomate at the time that promised
to sew covers for whatever I needed.  I bought 5&quot; or 6&quot; foam at an 
upholstery store.  Thicker is better, but it needs to be *firm*.

Basically I covered the floor and part of the split between the seats with
three separate squares(rectangles) to make up the bed.  Contoured pieces 
are horrible to try and make covers for.

I never slept better in my life!!...of course I always sleep better at the 
beach&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am trying to figure out a way to make a custom size mattress for a non VW
&gt; vehicle and thought that the list might be able to give me some ideas on what
&gt; to use. 

&gt; size and shape, so it will need to be something that I can cut and shape.

&gt; Anyone have any ideas? What are the stock cushions in a bus made from? Some
&gt; kind of foam, but what thickness would be comfortable?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
