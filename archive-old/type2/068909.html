The line from the distributor should plug into the tube that points
straight back at you when looking at it.  That's just to the right of
the assembly the throttle cable attaches to, and just below where the
air cleaner attaches.

As to adjusting the 34pict3, Bob Hoover wrote up how to do it a while
ago.  Take a look at http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover.
