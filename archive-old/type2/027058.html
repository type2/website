Hi all -

Forgot to add on my last post.  I'm getting so much scoop/advice, that I may 
be neglecting to thank each contributor.  Just wanted to thank all that have 
taken the time to lend their knowledge &amp; experience.  This list is 
absolutely fantastic, &amp; I hope - at some undetermined point in the future - 
to be able to help some pour soul in over his/her head (like me!).

Thanks everyone,

Mark
