John,

Christa and I have a Thetford 135 porta-potti we are very happy with.  It's
taken us on innumerable weekend trips, on a three month trip around the
continent, and to Inuvik and back.  We've built a box to hold the
porta-potti, TP, chemical, and books and maps.  No smell, even on the rough
roads we encounter on our weekend trips, where one would expect the
contents to slosh back and forth pretty hard.  Totally easy to operate.
Ours has capacity for maybe three to four days use by two adults.

Given that we travel to and camp in remote areas with primitive (if any)
campsites, our porta-potti is dollar for dollar far and away the best
after-market camping accessory we've ever purchased for the bus.  It is
well worth the space it occupies, especially considering that the box
holding the porta-potti makes a perfect seat for when one is cooking on the
stove or doing the dishes (and it becomes an ottoman when stretching out
reading on the rear seat or when the passenger seat is turned around!).
