Subject: RE: [T2] Hagerty Insurance

I tried to get classic car insurance on my '71.  Got the same response from 
all of them, sorry we can't insure campers.  So I called rv insurance... &amp;quot;we 
can't insure air-cooled vehicles.&amp;quot;
Even if I had been able to get the classic car insurance, it's only good for 
5k miles/year.  I drive 10k just on camping trips in the summer.
So I had to add the bus to my regular insurance.  But they told me that in 
the event of a claim, even with full coverage, they can only give me book 
value on the bus.  Which is far less than a classic of 35 years like it is.  
So I just got liability and a big fire extinguisher.

&amp;gt;I just tried to get insurance for my 1977 Westy which
&amp;gt;is garaged for the winter, we said there was no gas
&amp;gt;hooked up in it, and they declined to insure. Anyone
&amp;gt;else have this problem?
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
