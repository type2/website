Hi,

&gt; I did some searching and made some phone calls.  No one 
&gt; makes a light truck tire in the 205/65R15 and absolutely no load range D
in 
&gt; that size. 

 Michelin make the Agilis 41 in 205/65R15C which had a load index of 102T.

 That's 1874lbs at 118mph. I don't know what the definition of &quot;Load range
D&quot;
is (will someone please post this information, if they have it!!!) but
a max loading of 1874lbs is plenty for a bus.

 205/65R15C is a stock size for T4 type IIs (&quot;Eurovans&quot;), though 
195/70R15C is more common.

 I don't believe that the Michelin is the only tyre with this 
specification that's manufactured: Someone is spinning you a line.

 What's this &quot;light truck&quot; thing anyway? You want a van tyre- that's
what you're driving... :-)

Cheers,
	W.
