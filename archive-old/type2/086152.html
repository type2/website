Subject: Important Change regarding Bus Depot E-mail &amp; website    (no bus content)

Starting immediately, there will be a major change in the way e-mail and
website inquiries are handled at The Bus Depot.

Until now, a separate contractor in Massachusetts handled our email
inquiries and website orders, whereas phone calls went directly to our shop
in Pennsylvania.  Putting a separate crew in charge of email was meant to
improve service.  But ultimately it failed, for a lot of reasons.  Besides
the obvious risk of miscommunication when email is going to a remote
location 200 miles from the shop, there were also complaints about slow,
incomplete, or unanswered email.

So, as of now, it's back under my direct control.  All website orders and
email (either via the website form or to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com) now go right to
the shop, under the direct supervision of either myself or my store manager
Dan Sheridan. This will result in a dramatic improvement in both the speed
and quality of email response from The Bus Depot.  It will mean that you can
email rather than phone, and be confident of receiving a quick and complete
response.  I am looking for same or next business day response to every
email as quickly as we can attain it.  And as a side benefit, telephone
customer service will also improve, as improved email response will reduce
call volume and ease the phone reps' workload.

(Incidentally, this change has resulted in job openings here in Pa. for
several positions.  Email me, or pass it on.)

The transition has been underway for a couple of weeks and is now complete.
So the worst is over, and from here on in, everything should be relatively
smooth (I hope!).  I think we'll start out better than before from the
get-go, and only improve from there during the coming weeks and months.
However, if you didn't get a reply to email sent over the last few weeks
(during the transition period), please do me a favor and shoot me a quick
note.  I've been matching recent emails against responses, just to make sure
that no one &quot;slipped through the cracks&quot; while we were migrating evertthing,
but I can't rule out the possibility that I missed something (although I'm
doing do my best).

So, expect to see a significant improvement in the quality of customer
service at The Bus Depot as we move forward.  And if you have any feedback
on the changes (positive or negative), please do email me personally at
ron_at_busdepot_dot_com . You would be doing me a great favor to let me know how
we're doing as we progress into the spring season.

Thanks for putting up with our growing pains and trials and errors ... we're
still learning ... :-)

Thanks,
