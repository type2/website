Subject: Guages

Happy Friday to All.

My guages were delivered today! I bought oil temp and pressure, volts, and
cylinder head temp guages and the dash-top pods to put them in. I am
installing them onto a 1974 , 1800, manual trans bus and I'm looking for
experienced advice. Has anyone done a similar installation? Any pitfalls to
watch for, hidden trouble spots, etc? Also, does anyone know if the temp
sensor will fit under my #3 spark plug, or will I have to find an alternate
mounting point?

Thanks in advance.

PS: I bought my first bus as a newlywed back in 1975. It was a 68
Sportmobile and we absolutely loved it. Problem was, at that time I didn't
know JACK about cars of any kind; hadn't ever done even an oil change. It
was only a matter of months until I realized that I wasn't ready for that
bus and reluctantly traded it in for something new. It was ten years before
I owned another bus, but in that time I had learned a lot of mechanicing,
most of it the hard way. (Fix it or walk!)  The point of all this is to say
that this list is the finest resource I have ever run across and has made me
confident to take my bus anywhere I care to go.  Thanks to all of you,
newbies and gurus alike.

Dave
