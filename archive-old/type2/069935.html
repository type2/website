To add fuel to the fire, here is the VIN tag from my '59 single cab 
and VWAG's (inaccurate) interpretation:

7 11  8
360 176 178
UJ  261 BLUE 408605

Feb. 18, 1992

Dear xxx,

Thank you for your inquiry.

In connection with your vehicle our records reveal the 
following data:

Model               261
Chassis No.         629 152 (not even close)
Colour              blue (dove blue)
Production Date     Nov. 11, 1958 (Nov. 7, 1958 by my reading)
Delivery Date       Nov. 17, 1958 to the USA

Other than the above information is, regrettably, not 
available.

So judge for yourself about info from VWAG...

Dave
