Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure dropping to Zero after 15 mnutes warm up 
  when I  stop?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 15 minutes (Oil temps 200-210) the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pressure drops to 0.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Checked the oil pressure with oil pressure gauge (electric VDO and
&gt; mechanical generic), checked pressure relief valves, and replaced the oil 
&gt; pump.
&gt;


Got a mechanical gauge and it seemed that the oil  pressure was a little 
higher than with the VDO Sensor, maybe 3-5 psi but thats all it takes for 
the idiot light to come on. Going to buy a new sensor today.

Thanks,

Trey.
