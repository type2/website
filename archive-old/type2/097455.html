Somebody needs to fix this STUPID filter!!!!

The symbols don't work!

2007..... 30 year rolling exemption, IF the tree huggers don't get the law
changed!

 BTW, you cannot buy a used cat at any wrecking yard in Calif. Against the law
for them to sell them, so they whack them off when they have 'em up on the
rack draining all the fluids. Good luck finding a good cross-over pipe, they
usually whack off the cat at the U bend of the cross-over! And the muffler is
usually welded to the cat, so that is gone also.

 &gt; I recently purchased a 1977 Bus with an exhaust system
&gt; that will not pass California smog.  I knew this
&gt; before I bought the van.  There are two straight pipes
&gt; going into the mufflers, no catalytic converters.
&gt;
&gt; I need a complete exhaust system for a 1977 bus.  I'm
&gt; not concerned about looks or quality.  Used is fine.
&gt; I just need it to pass smog.  Anyone want to sell one?
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking of going to pickapart this weekend,
&gt; something I've never done before, but probably should.
&gt;  Problem as always is time.  I would rather go camping
&gt; on the weekends than hang out at pickapart, but either
&gt; idea is kind of fun.
&gt;
&gt; Any other good salvage yards in the SF Bay area?
&gt;
&gt; I looked at the bus depot catalogs and they don't
&gt; carry complete california-spec exhausts for 77 buses.
&gt; What to do?
&gt;
&gt; BTW, when will this '77 be waived of smog requirements
&gt; in California?
