&gt;I would like to patch and also I need to re-torque the heads. 
&gt; I don't want to have to drop it in the
&gt;street again and I'm sure the neighbors don't want to see me doing so. 
&gt;Rain is a major factor in all this too.

Greg,
I've been working in the street for 10 years now. The rules are: Alway say 
hello to neighbors and answer maybe one follow up 
question, but then continue working. Don't engage them or you'll never get 
your job done. Don't talk to them and torque 
the heads at the same time or you'll end up with leaky push rod tube seals. 
Sweep broken glass, crack vials etc, from 
under your workspot before lying down. open your top hatch and rig a tarp 
over it for working in the rain. If you spill oil 
or other obnoxious fluids do your best to clean it up, even if it's city 
property. Don't leave your jack or tools in the bus 
overnight. Keep your registration and paperwork with you at the bus for 
inspection by police. Call police 'sir' and provide
a specific explanation why you're doing what your doing 'the cylinder head 
was loose and unsafe, so I've got to tighten
it up.'  if they give you neck about it, assure them that the engine will be 
back in 'in an hour' or 'by first light' and make it so.
when working in the middle of the night be aware of sleeping people, don't 
whip breaker bars to the ground or swear too 
loudly, think about your next move, know where your tools are so you don't 
have to make noise rooting around in your box.
Try to always have the car running and finished before you go inside. The 
goal is that when you wake up, you should be able
to get in it and drive to California if you had to. That means alot of 
planning before each job. (tool &amp; parts list) try to have more
tools or parts than you'll need. It will save you misery later.
