Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Valve Guides

&gt;I just got back from a 400 mile trip and now my valve guide
&gt;tubes are leaking. I know this is normal for a bus, but I just reworked
&gt;them about 3500 miles ago with all new rings (all 16 of them) and they
&gt;were all set in and not leaking.

Those would be the pushrod tubes. VERY different from valve guides.

 From your story I think you are okay. Did you oil the new seals before you 
installed them? If you don't it is possible for the seals to be cut or 
pinched when they are installed. No sealant also I think was the final 
opinion of the list so that they can move a bit as the engine expands and 
contracts.
