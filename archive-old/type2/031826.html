&gt; Here you have two young women with their first bus,and, without getting in
&gt; trouble for generalizing, what do you think the chances are of them opening

whut was a timing light??? sure, but that old 60 microbus (wish I still
had it) didn't take much to set the timing either.

now this 2liter FI I have is a different story, but I do get up the hills
a little faster
 
&gt; went togeather with the Craftsman beginner kit and broken knuckles. Now
&gt; being older and somewhat wiser, I no longer break bolts or bust knuckles,
&gt; but then the box is now almost all snap-on, but I had to start somewhere.

somewhere about 15-20 years ago someone broke in and stole my toolbox, all
full of SK tools....well not having enough insurance I bought a set of
Wards sockets and wrenches... thinking to replace them, dang things won't
break so I have no excuse to buy new tools (OK so I don't need an excuse)
Don't think I have broken any of em, lost a few but not broken...of course
I'm not a pro any more, used to be a machinist but got smart and went back
to college.

and the best screwdrivers I ever have found are the Stanley big fist
screwdrivers, but their very hard to find but they have a grip you can
really get your hands around.

Oh well the moral of this rambling is to buy the best tools you can
afford. and then suppliment em as you can.
