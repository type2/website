Subject: Re: [T2] Switch on dash question?

[...]  That's what it does in my 71 Westy = controls power to the rear light.  If the dash switch is off (pushed in) - the rear light will not go on, regardless of what you do with the pushbuttons on the light.

&gt; The symbol on your switch, eye lens with lines radiating, May be the switch that supplies power to your rear interior light.  On my 74 Westy, it powers the flourescent on the left side above the table.  The flourescent also has a switch on it, but will not work without the dash switch pulled on.
