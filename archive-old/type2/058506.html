Subject: RE: Bay rocker panel replacement missing

&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there ready to do a battery tray and has the skill to do a step
&gt;by step for the rest of us?
&gt;
&gt;  Stephen Gutknecht

I could do a 'how-not-to!'
&quot;Friend&quot; at a body shop put my DBH battery tray in a while ago... I then
had to shoot a WHOLE tube of silicone caulk in there to keep it from
rusting out   8P!  He is not such a good friend esp after charging me $450
to ruin a DAMN GOOD DBH tray.

PROPER way:

Cut ALL the metal on the bus back to the seams, or at least leave the
smallest amount of flange possible to weld the new panel to.
Bend any leftover bits DOWN, not up - up will catch water, and require a
bunch of silicone goo to seal it.

Access is difficult, but talking to a REAL bodyman convinced me that _if_
you know how to weld, this is not too hard to do; can't do worse than my
'buddy!'
Real problem is not knowing how to weld, and contorting yourself in to that
small space - practice somewhere else before hand.
