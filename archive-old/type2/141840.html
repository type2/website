&gt; I used to think the same when my CHT read 550-600 at normal cruise 
&gt; (gauge must be wrong).  turns out I had a vacuum leak at my manifold 
&gt; for that head (other head fine).  ran that way for a while.  
&gt; ultimately put on better heads.  that head had a guide that was 
&gt; cracked and loose in the head. now I run 350-460 with my new 8.0:1 CR 
&gt; (efficient ported heads, big valves, big carbs etc.)
&gt;
&gt; in a perfect world if I were you I would get exhaust mixture analyzed 
&gt; sometime, injectors tested/cleaned (maybe just imperfect spray on that 
&gt; cyl?) exhaust infrared temp compared on all four, maybe . . . try the 
&gt; CHT on a different spark plug??? that would be  a free way to tell a 
&gt; lot.  although the VDO setup is inaccurate and non-compensated it is 
&gt; OK in my opinion. trends yes.  when you tuned the mix you tuned all 
&gt; cylinders (Whoa make sure it is in the right place now).

Will;

Unfortunately, I live in Indiana where there are no emission testing 
requirements.  Consequently, it costs an arm and a leg to go to a speed 
shop to get this done.  In lieu of that, I installed an air/fuel ratio 
meter from CB performance that runs off the oxygen sensor ( I have a 
stock 79 cal emissions bus) so that I could adjust mixture properly 
(not needed).  I also verified the reading of this meter using an 
averaging voltmeter reading the output of the ox sensor.  When I 
installed my heads, I took great a great deal of time measuring stroke, 
deck height and cylinder head volume, then shimmed the cylinders at the 
base (no head gasket) to achieve a stock compression ratio of 7.3 : 1.  
I also took great care assembling the induction and cooling systems and 
verified that there were no vacuum leaks using a vacuum gauge. I had 
had the injectors cleaned and flow/balanced tested by Cruzin 
Performance.  Everything indicates normal except for the CHT gauge.  
The bus runs perfectly, hot or cold, at any speed and gets 20-21 mpg on 
the road.  So at this point, I'm no longer terribly concerned about the 
VDO CHT because I don't believe it is correct.  I use it as a trend 
indicator only.  When I get around to it I plan to install the Dakota 
Digital setup.
