Subject: Bus Depot German muffler quality 70 Bus

Volks,
I had made the mistake of buying a brazilian muffler for my 70 single cab=
 in the bus format (one pipe not 2 pea shooters).  It did not fit worth a=
 darn.....

So, I took advantage of the Bus Depot triple discount day and bought a ne=
w german one...It arrived on Wednesday, and It is on the truck and it fit=
s absolutely perfect.
