Subject: '60 23 Window deluxe-$2000 San Diego

Hi. The local Auto Trader had a '60 23 Window Deluxe for $2000. The ad said
it needed paint and interior, but ran great. It looked like it was white.
It also said that it was &quot;chopped and lowered&quot;. It did look lowered, but I
didn't see any obvious chopping in the picture. If it is a local bus, it
may be relatively rust-free, but it didn't say anything about rust in the
ad. The phone number is 619-462-8544.

Any and all legal disclaimers apply. Any use or reuse of this e-mail

Happy Hunting,
