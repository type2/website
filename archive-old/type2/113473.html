&gt;Not sure if you are asking about the Mexican engine or we are back on
&gt;the M-B side :) but my longblock came with no anti-seize at all on the
&gt;ngk plugs. I can't say if there was anything on the threads (i.e. any
&gt;lubrication like machine oil) but there appeared to be none.

Clean and dry is spec for every Euro I service. Clean and dry is ding 
danged perfect for new heads and plugs. The light oil film is enhancement 
of this spec to improve the results over time and use. I don't use a torque 
wrench. I can feel the crush of the washer and get 3 to 4 crushes with them 
before they are flat if they haven't been over torqued before somewhere's 
else. I haven't yet see a plug not worn over spec beyond such intervals. 
They are servicable for life with this procedure and NEVER a pulled thread 
or loose plug. Emphasis on NEVER a plug issue at all in 14 years operation. 
The plug issues come from other shops with people much much smarter than 
the engineers, just ask them.

My practice is just full of such very simple enhancements to factory 
procedures. A few moment here and there of extra care throughout any 
procedure can ensure lots less cost down the road.
