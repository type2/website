I would replace the line traveling from the Servo
to the Engine, the one with the one way air check 
in it. I replaced it last month and it took care 
of some vacuum leaks that I was having. You need 
the right kind - I bought mine from the dealer for $80 for only a couple of meters, but it's got the scotch guard in it. This replacement stopped my 
wild idle and hot running
