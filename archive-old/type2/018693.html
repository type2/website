Wow, and I felt screwed when my PO purchased 2.0L only lasted 5K when it
dropped #3 exhaust valve seat.  For which GEX denies that it is even one of
their rebuilds (despite having receipts to the contrary from the installer),
and they won't warranty as I am not the original purchaser...

GEX has quite a few dissatisfied one-time-only customers out there fooled by
their High Profile ADs....
