Subject: RE: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

&gt; Are you placing your Bus Depot orders online? I have found
&gt; that this usually takes longer. Its my understanding that
&gt; they pull their online orders daily at around 4pm and process
&gt; them. Most likely these orders don't get shipped until the
&gt; next day. So if you place an order at 7pm on Monday night,
&gt; they pull your order 4pm Tuesday, and your order probably
&gt; goes out Wednesday afternoon. Then add the shipping time and
&gt; you can see why it might take a week to get there.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I get almost all my stuff from the Depot,
&gt; I love the quality and service. No bad experiences or
&gt; inferior quality parts. I have found if you need something
&gt; out the door fast it's best to call them sometime in the
&gt; morning and see if they can arrange to have it shipped that day.


Orders placed with the Bus Depot get broken into two classes, regardless of
whether placed online or by phone - Standard delivery and Expedited
delivery.

Standard ground orders get placed in queue and are shipped based on the date
received (unless an item has to be ordered in, which can cause a
usually-short delay). Usually this means they go out the door within about a
day or so of when we get the order, if in stock of course. On a particularly
busy week it can be a bit longer, but even then we usually get caught back
up relatively quickly. To allow for times that we do get swamped, our
website says to allow 7-10 working days to receive your ground order. (Some
quote longer; CIP says 10-14.)  Plan on the 7-10, but often you'll see it
sooner. It's worth noting that often people forget to take into account
weekends and time-in-transit. On weekends nothing moves (UPS doesn't pick up
and we're closed), and UPS can take a week to ship coast-to-coast via
ground. Ordering via web versus phone usually won't make a significant
difference with ground orders. As Jules pointed out, if your order is placed
late in the day via the website we may not download it until the following
day, but otherwise it's usually downloaded same-day and gets sorted by date
along with the phone orders.

Expedited orders, on the other hand, go through a completely different
process. These are orders placed via 1, 2, or 3 working day service, and the
customer has agreed to pay the UPS upcharge for this service.  Our thought
is that if someone is willing to pay UPS extra for rush delivery, he's in a
hurry and we should hustle to get them right out the door. So those orders
go right to the front of the line, before all ground orders, no matter how
busy we are. In fact they literally go right into the store manager's bin as
soon as they're received. In-stock items ordered via Expedited usually ship
same-day (or next-day if ordered late in the day). In the case of Expedited
orders, it may indeed be faster to order by phone, as we can get your
approval of the shipping quote instantly and get right to work on the order.
(If you order Expedited via the website, where it's listed as Red Label or
Blue Label, we call or email you with the quote.)  In many cases the cost of
Expedited delivery is not that much higher than ground (depending on size,
weight, and destination), and your 5% list member discount will probably
offset that and then some. So it's worth calling for an Expedited quote if
you're in a bit of a hurry.
