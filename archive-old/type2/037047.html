Subject: Re: Road Trip Sleeping Places

In some states it is illegal to stay overnight in road-side rest areas
-- I figure the truckers know where to stop and if they're not staying
at the rest area I won't either. Also, locals can tell you if it's
ill-advised -- last time I went through Kansas they were having a spate
of rest-stop robberies.

I've stayed at truck stops, too -- and I'll take a noisy, well-lit SAFE
sleeping place over any other kind. I also like to think that if I were
in distress many macho truckers with tire-irons would come to my aid. :-)

I've got Don Wright's book &quot;Guide to Free Campgrounds&quot; that lists free
camping spots by state, and lists any restrictions as re: parking in
rest areas. He also does a series called &quot;Camping on a Shoestring&quot; by
region. You can get his books in any RV supply store or on-line.
