Subject: How do I identify Weber models?

All,

Ok, now for another potentially foolish question.

I'm looking at a used weber in the next week, but the
owner has even less knowledge of it than I do (if
that's possible). She tells me it was off of her '70
bus, but that it never ran properly. Her 'mechanic'
told her that weber's were &quot;racing&quot; carbs; not meant
for VW's!!!! She switched back to stock and now wants
to sell the weber.

But...I have no idea how to identify it. Are the model
#'s clearly stamped on the carb, like on my Solex?
I've never looked at a Weber, so I just don't know. If
not, how do I identify it??


TIA!
