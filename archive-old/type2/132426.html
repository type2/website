Subject: RE: [T2] Powder coating parts at home??

Range circuits are fused (breakered) at 50A, though if you only use the oven
you won't likely need all that (if you can find the ends of the heating
elements, you may be able to read the wattage rating on them... divide the
total wattage by the voltage to calculate amperage). If this is a residence,
Michael is right and you'll get 120v bus to bus. Watch out if you're on a
lighting circuit in a non-residential application; you could have 277v
across the hot and neutral, and that will shock the pi** out of you. AMHIK,
I've still got the scars to show you, and it happened when I was an
apprentice in 1978.

If you don't know what you're doing, PLEASE find someone who does.

&gt; Would work only if you have 2 circuits in the garage from each side of
&gt; the bus bar in the breaker box, which gets 110 to each side and a
&gt; neutral.  I'd never advise this but you &quot;could&quot; rewire the box with a
&gt; hot to the black, other side of the bus hot to the white, and keep the
&gt; ground wire to neutral............but then I doubt you'd have the 30 amp
&gt; wiring the stove needs (-*
