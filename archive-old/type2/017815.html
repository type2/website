Newly rebuilt '78 2.0L FI engine, with approx. 3k miles in almost four
months.  I feel it's time to change the oil.  However, it has been said
that if I'm changing to synthetic, I should go at least 5000 miles or
until leak down compression test show equaliztion b/t all cylinders.
Should I stay with petroleum oil for another oil change, or hold off on
my oil change until the previous mentioned conditions are met.  Any
thoughts, anybody?

Alabama Pete in Colorado (soon to have Colorado plates:)

PS.Thanks for all the discussion on my oil pressure readings and stuck
rear brake pads.  I ordered replacement plugs for the rear drums for
fifty cents each from RMMW.
