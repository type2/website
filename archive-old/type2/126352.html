Subject: Re: [T2] Re: no muffler

I drove a Beetle back and forth to work for a week and a half with heater boxes but no muffler. No problems but then I had plenty of spare parts. Trip was 20 miles each way at 60-70 mph. Eventually though the Marines at the gate (we were in Italy) told me to fix it or park off base. Either my bank account or JC Whitney (back when I would do business with them) caught up with my needs and I fixed it. 

Burnt two spots on the rear apron and made a sooty mess.

Chris
