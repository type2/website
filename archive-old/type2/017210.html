Subject: '80 vanagon Camper Virginia

Where :   At A-1 Towing, 5605 Vine Street,
Alexandria Virginia
What:      '80 white(ish) vanagon camper   Not too
shabby; dry rotted canvas, decent cabinets,
relatively solid body.  Not pretty, though.
Bumpers are bent, driver's vent window broken,
with glass on the front.  Missing radio (does have
stove and refrigerator, though.  Also, one table)
Sliding door is blue.  Windshield needs
attention/replacement

How much:  'Red' writes that anything with papers
goes for $150 or more.  I think he is looking for
about $200.  Phone number does not matter, because
'Red' cannot talk.

Look up the address in mapquest.  I am sure the
first one there with $200 and a tow bar will take
it away.  I am outta here this weekend.  It better
be gone when I get back!!
