Subject: Re: combining 1.7L engine wiht 091 trans and '79FI... will it work?
References: &lt;199811250420.VAA26331_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

       You'll have no problems with the 091 if you use the 2.0L flywheel
and clutch. I'd put the FI on it and try it -- the cam might be a tad
off, and it might also run a bit rich because it's a smaller engine, but
better too rich than too lean! You can always take it off.
     BTW, I put FI in my '73, and the only problem I had was that the
gas tank doesn't have a return line. So what I did was to put a &quot;T&quot; in
the line ahead of the fuel filter, with the return line from the
pressure relief valve going to the T. Works fine. I mounted the CU above
the battery, just hung it there from a couple of strong bungeee straps.
The airfilter just sort of sits there, hasn't been a problem so far  --
no, these aren't &quot;sano&quot; solutions, but I didn't have a MIG welder handy
when I did it to fab new mounts. I carefully drilled holes in the
firewall to mount the double relay, etc, and also put the filter and
pump in the engine compartment, mounting the pump vertically on the
front right corner of the compartment  -- wondered a bit whether the
change in position would affect it, but it seems to work okay.
