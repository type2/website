Subject: Torsion Bar Adjustment

I had the torsion bar adjusted on my '74 Bay to raise the saggy rear end.  So
now the rear tire is about level or flush with the wheel well (body) of the
bus.  Before the body sat several inches below the top of the rear tires.  I
have a situation now where the spring plate knocks against the stopper over
minor bumps.  The spring plate rests less than 1/4 inch above the stopper.  As
I understand the recent adjustment was made to both the inner and outer
splines one position.  Any suggestions on how to re-adjust the torsion bar so
that the spring plate does not knock against the stopper?
