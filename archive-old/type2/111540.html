&gt; &gt; If you paste your multi-line URL in at www.tinyurl_dot_com, it will spit out a
&gt; &gt; very short version that anyone can cut and paste very easily.
&gt;
&gt; I understand that one drawback of this is that TinyURL links are short-lived
&gt; compared to listserv archive storage.  After a short time, the link expires
&gt; and the archived message looses some of its usefulness.

This is indeed a drawback although the life-span of most web page links is
not usually very long either.  Discretion would be needed. If the link is
important and to a permanent site then the full link would be better.

                             OOK!
