John,

Saw your post to the list about broken off studs.  I recently had an
experience with a broken off screw in my engine that I hope may help you.  It
was one of the tin screws on the cylinder head.  I tried an easy out and broke
it off too.  What a pain!  The steel in the easy out was very hard and I went
through 3 cobalt drill bits (the hardest I could find) trying to get it out.
What finally worked to drill/grind the tough steel out was a diamond dremel
bit (my wife suggested that; it didn't even occur to me to try that - she's
pretty good in that dept.) .  I wore that one out, too, but it got rid of the
impossibly hard steel from the easy out, and I could use a regular bit to
drill out the hole.  As for what to use when you get the exhaust studs out, I
just dealt with that the other day, too.  I found a stud (M 8 x 1.25/M 10 x
1.5 x 35 or 36 mm long I think; if anyone on the list knows this is wrong,
please correct me) at my FLAPS for about $1.30 each.  I tapped out the old
hole to a 10mm x 1.5 pitch hole and used the new studs.  I'll probably loctite
the studs in today.  

Greetings from a fellow Michigander from the Downriver/Wyandotte area (but
living in Montana),

Good luck with the exhaust studs.
