Subject: Re: [T2] kids and seat belts

I find the possibility of the kids passing through the broken window, and 
into the path of other moving vehicles when they strike the ground, a much 
more dreadful thought than the happy thoughts you get from seeing them 
asleep in a Z-Bed.  Probably not a wise decision.  I used to sleep behind 
the backseat in my parents' 74 beetle.  The heat and vibration from the 
engine made it a cozy little place.  I would never in 100 years let my 
children sleep in such a place while driving.  The times, they are 
a'changin'....

Eron

Do you take them out of their
&gt;booster seats and let them sleep in the back?
&gt;
&gt;I have this personal dread involved doing it but I want to.

&gt;I know when I was young seat belts weren't a big deal
&gt;but my kids are so used to them it's not an issue.  What
&gt;do the other parents do? And why?

&gt;Thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;James
