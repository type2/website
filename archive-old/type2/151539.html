Subject: Re: [T2] trans swap, '72 into '68

yeah, but..... I hear the 68 - 71 trans is bomb, ticking, due to internal
design?  Not to mention the differences with clutch, pressure plate, input
shaft length, bearing in the pressure plate, etc.....  That is mainly what
I was trying to avoid.

Mark,

IIRC, I don't think the gearing on the '72 tranny is significantly
different than for the '68.  They didn't change the gearing until '73.5.

see the first line on:

Just a heads up...

Cheers,
