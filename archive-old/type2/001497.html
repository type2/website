Just purchased a 71 deluxe *w/Sunroof, that works* from an auto wholesaler
here in San Diego.  Everything was good except for the engine that was stuck
solid.  So, before I pulled the engine to see what the problem was,  I
drained the oil. Wasn't surprised to see that mostly broken pieces of engine
drained out, with a little oil.

The bus was sold this week and the new owner doesn't have the bread for a
new, or completely rebuilt engine.  He just wants to get it going with an
affordable used engine for now.

Considering the purchase of a used *refurbished* engine from :
www.interstatevw_dot_com ... Has anyone bought/used one of these engines with
any success?

Any positive information would be appreciated.

Bob

&gt; Hey all
&gt;  It came up yesterday about installing a sunroof in a westy. I went and
&gt; looked at mine today and there are no drains. The holes are in the frame
&gt; work, but the hole just go down ito the body. If you install a sunroof
&gt; and do not install the drain tubes, you will fill the body with water and
&gt; rust will destroy.
