Subject: Be honest... How fast?

Okay everyone:
Honestly.
How fast do you drive your bus?
I've subscribed off and on for a couple years, and have owned a bus since
93 (a 1978 Westy, to be precise), and know the informal rule of thumb on
speed... SLOW.
I broke it big time on a couple cross-continental trips during hot weather
the last several years, and this summer paid the dear price -- $3,000, to
be exact -- for a new engine. No doubt in my mind that my need for speed
(anyone ever driven the west Texas flats on a lonely mid-week afternoon?)
had a lot to do with that.
I know better now, and keep the needle, well, lower. I won't say exactly
where, because I want an untainted peek into my fellow bus owners' driving
habits. I'm especially interested in hearing responses from post-72
drivers, but all input will be welcome! Consider this a survey of the
non-Friday variety, since it directly correlates with the life expectancy
of your vehicle. This is serious stuff!
Really, honest.
Bus on,
Jeff
