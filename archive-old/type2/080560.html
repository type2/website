Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust leaks


&gt;I will do this again, and work harder to get
&gt;it right, but it sure would be nice if there was a product or procedure
&gt;to help when the surfaces just don't mate quite right. Is there such a
&gt;thing?

Long metal file. File both pipe surfaces on one side simultaneously. File 
until both pipes have shiny surfaces all the way around the opening. In 
addition to twisting and warping - my pipes seemed to have uneven surfaces 
as well.

Takes 20 minutes per side (at least with my old file), I used a cutting 
fluid like used on a drill bit I think.

It is best done with the heater box or pipe in a vise.
