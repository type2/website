Subject: Electrical Help Please!

Hey All-

I need a little electrical help with my '70 bus...

A while back I posted my problem with some sort of electric
short/burn-out resulting in smoke where the turn signal switch meets the
steering wheel column. Fuse #2 blew at that time.

For better or worse, I took the car to a local &quot;VW speciliast&quot; garage
for their look.  The fuse box was a mess, which I knew, and had been
planning to fix.  They replaced the entire fuse box, and turn signal
flasher switch? (is that the right word?)  The guy recommended a new
emergency-flasher-switch which he honestly told me I could do myself and
save $25 on labor, but he didn't have one in stock.  This was a couple
weeks ago.  So I was going to go get one tomorrow and install it.

Question #1 - I only have Muir and he does little with electrical
diagrams...where the heck does this thing go?

Question #2 - Fuse #2 (counting from the left) has blown twice in the
last two weeks.  I have not replaced it since the second time for fear
of some real electrical blow-out.  The only result of it being out is
that the driver side tailight does not work.  Brake light fine, reverse
light fine, turn signal fine.  The repair place had put a 16amp (red)
fuse in #2 spot - that was the first to blow.  I put in an 8amp (white)
and that was the second to blow.  Today, for an experiment to help
narrow down the cause, I put in a 25amp (blue) and turned on the
headlights and turn signal switch.  Smelled a little like something was
hot and burning when I put my nose down near the fuse box.  Left it like
that for about 2 min.  Then shut everything off.  Fuse didn't blow, but
probably shouldn't leave that one in there.

Any ideas?  Thanks!!

Mike
