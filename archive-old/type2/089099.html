[...]

No way no how can they be the same number.
There are 4 different Vanagon sliding windows.
The bus one has the latch handle at the corner of the glass. There is a left
and a right. The sliding window is at the front on each side.
The Westy one has the latch handle 14 1/2&quot; back from the corner of the glass,
so you can have the screen installed and open the window. There is a left and
a right.


&gt; reassembly.  just noticed that the sliding door window and the kitchen
&gt; side window are the same part number.

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; This moss that I can't get to yet is located in the center of both
&gt; &gt; pieces of glass and on the synthetic felt seal. It runs about 4 inches
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; the bottom upwards. I removed the top channel gasket/seal, the one that
&gt; &gt; goes along the top and down one side.
&gt; &gt; To no avail, there was still not enough clearance to lift up and
&gt; &gt; out on the bottom of the plate of glass. I tried briefly to remove the
&gt; &gt; push-down latch ( 3 holes ) but couldn't find the right tool. But I
&gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; think that would help anyways.
