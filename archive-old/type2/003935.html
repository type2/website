Subject: ignition switch question (steering wheel lock)

ok last time I hope,
I finally got the ignition housing off of my 73 and while I was messing with
the switch I think I figured out what is wrong with it but need confirmation.
The original problem was that the alternator light would come on when the bus
was turned off. Could this be caused by the ??steering wheel lock (the piece
that is supposed to shoot into the steering column when the key is removed)
not engaging.  Mine wasn't but after some banging around, trying to remove the
housing, it started to pop out when the key is removed.  I would love to think
that this would cause the alternator light to cut on but am truly doubtful.

If this couldn't possibly cause this symptom how do you get the lock housing
out to change out the electrical portion?  I removed the real tiny screw on
the housing itself and the 2 screws hidden way down in the screwholes but as
of yet have not been able to budge it.  Bentley is of no help here as it says
to remove these screws and remove housing with no explanation as to how.

TIA
