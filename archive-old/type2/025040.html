Howdy List,
	I purchased a new 1600 case for a rebuild in my 1970 Bus, this
is only my 2nd VW rebuild so I have a few questions not covered in the
standard manuals.
1.  Those gasket kits we get from the standard vendors some pieces seem
real thin (ie. the paper cylinder gaskets between the cylinder and the
case)  are they supposed to be that thin or should I reinforce with a
home made gasket?
2.  Do you recommend using adhesive when sealing the 2 halves of the
case together or are the machined surfaces enough?
			Thank you in advance,		Dan
