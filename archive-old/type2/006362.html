Subject: Need to check it the cam is set corredctly

Engine Builders,
    Am still having trouble with top end power and horrible (10mpg) gas
mileage on carbureated 2 liter engine in 81 Vanagon.

    Have checked pretty much everything short of pulling the motor,
splitting the case, and seeing if the cam is set right.

Can anyone thing of a way I can test the motor still in the car to see if
the cam is off a tooth or 2?
