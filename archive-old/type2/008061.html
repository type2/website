 Hi volks,

&gt; I've just bought a set of 15x6.5&quot; rims for my 77 bus. 

 Why?

&gt;.  Has anyone tried un-reinforced
&gt; 205/65/15 passenger car tires on these rims?

 This sounds like a bad idea to me.

&gt;  Does the bus handle better/worse?

 Than what?  They'll be worse than the stock 185R14Cs.

&gt;  I called TireRack and they reccomended the reinforced Goodyear
&gt; tires that come on the Eurovan.

 Soundsto me like they are talking sense. There's a good chance they'll fit and be correctly rated for your bus. It'll probably handle better than stock with those on.
 Incidentally, I don't think Goodyears are what come on T4s in the UK. I'll check- if anyone's interested- let me know.

&gt;  The problem is that they are $102 each!!

 Err, yes. Actually, that sounds pretty cheap to me...
 
&gt; I've also heard that they are not very good tires.  Suggestions?

 Try 'phoning round your local tyre dealers and see if anyone can supply Eurovan tyres more cheaply. They are probably a bit overspecified, though, I think the Eurovan is probably heavier than your bus- but then, why did you want 15&quot; wheels anyway? If it was to improve the handling then you will want to put good tyres on, otherwise you'd have been better staying with the 14&quot; rims and just upgrading the tyres.

 The best choice for you depends on what you're trying to achieve.

Cheers,
                W.
