I am trying to find some parts to continue the restoration of my 72 Westy and think 
that the list membership could be of great help.

Does anyone would know where I could find a inner B post or pillar( do not know if it is 
the real name for the part...) behind the door on the driver side. I need only the 
bottom 5 or 6 inches (beginning about 1 or 2 inches above the floor and down)

To describe accurately this piece, please see the picture on my Web site at the 
following address:  http://members.xoom_dot_com/DaMorning/post repair.gif

I did receive a paper model for the part from Kelly Brown Jr, AKA Metwiz
( http://members.aol_dot_com/KBrown7723/page1.html ) who, by the way, have been very 
helpful to me and for which I thank him very much, but my expertise being what it is 
presently, if I could find the real thing... you know what I mean.. :-)

I have no access to junkyard in my area and I have not found this part at my FLAPS or 
other retailers in Canada.

Thank you for your help.
