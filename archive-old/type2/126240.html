Subject: Twin Cities Volswagen Club Show

It's time again for the annual Twin Cities Volkswagen Club show!  It will be 
held on 6 June, my '72 Westfalia Campmobile's 32nd birthday, at Rudy Luther's 
Westside Volkswagen in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota.  It starts 9:00 a.m. and 
ends at 3:00 p.m.

Too bad I won't have the Westy there.  It has a really bad oil leak and needs 
a new cylinder head.  Anyone have one of the '72 only no air injection port 
heads laying around you don't need?
