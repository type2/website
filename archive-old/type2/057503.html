Subject: FS 1971 POPTOP

Well it has been 5 years in coming, but I have decided to sell my 71.

It has been a great machine (LA- KEY WEST, YOSEMITE - OREGON, YOSEMITE - LA multiple times) Only had one major problem when the vacum dist. failed, oh well needed a new long block anyway ;)

New since I bought it (was off the road from Sept 96 to July 98 due to CA SMOGII - now exempt)

4 shocks
front disc pads
front brake flex hoses
Long block (less than 4000 miles)
Deep sump (I heard them all, I like it)
Dual Vacum Diaphram ($70, more than I thought it would be)
Exhust tips (bug muffler)
Front seat covers - TMI
Curtains beige (all around and front windshield too!)
Refinished all interior wood panels (Varithane)
AM/FM Cassette 80watts speakers in front doors (have orig. AM radio works)
poptop/luggage rack  seals

Tires are in good condition (10 to 20 thousand miles left?)
Has child cot, but not ref or side cabinet.
I custom made new poptop tent from ripstop - has huge rear window/ screen that allows loading luggage rack from inside the bus.

I am near Yosmite (45 miles from Fresno) in central California.

Older pictures are on my website stantasy.home.ml_dot_org

Of course I want 3k, asking 2.5k, might get?

Will deliver if the trip sounds good.
