Subject: pitted pistons/heads

I bought a 2000 type iv engine out of an '82 vanagon at the junk yard this week
and stripped it down for parts.  I got most of what I wanted.  In the process of
breaking it down, I noticed that the tops of the pistons and parts of the heads
were badly damaged.  Pitted is actually a gross understatement.  In fact it
looked like someone had been at them with a hammer and chisel.  The plugs looked
OK...maybe a little on the black side.  So any one know what caused this to
happen. What ever it is I sure don't want that to happen to my engine.  

I noticed that there were a lot of loose and broken hoses and vacuum lines in
the Fuel Injection System, Which may have some bearing on the state of the
pistons and heads

Anyone have any Ideas or have you seen this before????    John Jensen in
