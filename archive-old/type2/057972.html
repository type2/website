&gt; Okay, you folks out there running Berg engines, you've heard the big spiel

&gt; CR produces abysmal gas mileage in the 70 bus--in the order of 13-14 mpg. I
&gt; am running a 34 pict 3, 125 main jet, stock exhaust, dual-vac dizzy, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; This engine has the &quot;semi-hemi&quot; heads on it, which Berg counsels will
&gt; require more total advance and/or leaner jetting to not run over rich. I've
&gt; got the 4 extra degrees of total advance cranked in, but it doesn't help.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there with a similar setup? What kind of mileage do you get?
&gt; what kind of carb are you running? What jetting?

What kind of distrubutor are you using? I would make sure that you had a
vacuum advance dizzy, like a 005. When I put a 009 on my type 4 with no
other changes, my mileage dropped from about 26 MPG (us) to 19. Ps, this
is a stock '78 FI bus.
