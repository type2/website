&gt; Sounds like you have excess crankcase pressure.
&gt;
&gt; Oil should not be pressurized from any point that high above the fill line.
&gt; check all the breather hoses, from the breather chimney, and check the valve
&gt; adjustments, as they may be the root of the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Some engines require better crankcase breathing, many companies sell
&gt; breather kits that expel the excess pressure into a box, and then into the
&gt; atmosphere.

Hi Jake,

I feel like I am fighting a losing battle here.  When we first bought the bus in

March, it ran great!  There was no problem any where, now I feel like the bloody

thing is a colossal waste of money.  Now you are telling me that there may be a
problem with pressure.  Christ, I am nearing my end with this thing.  I love
this bus, but I am ready to pull out the motor, and set the frigging thing on
fire!
