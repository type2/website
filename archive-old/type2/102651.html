Subject: Re: [T2] Nicknames

&gt; I've got a '76 Bus, and wondered how to figure out it's &quot;tag&quot;.  By body
&gt; style? Year?

Don't think so hard! These are affectionate names we give our buses - like
boats. I named mine 'Portia' because I used to own a 911 that I really loved
and didn't want my bus to get jealous when I would mutter 'I miss my
Porsche...'

-Eric
