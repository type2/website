&gt; Another mechanic (one I recently found and am currently using) is
&gt; Continental Repair in Watertown. The proprietor's name is Harry, and
he only
&gt; works on VW, air-cooled being his favorite. He's not keen on working
on
&gt; engines bigger than 1600cc.

Does this mean that he doesn't like to work on modified Type 1s or
that he doesn't like to work on type 4s (or both)?
