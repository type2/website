Awesome job Richard! Really impressed with your work, not to mention those
are the identical seats I have, except my hedrests are still there. :-)
Three questions - What paint did you use, what was the acid, and where did
you get your horsehair from?
Thanks,
Courtney

&gt; I repaired one of my front seats on the weekend.  My hat off to anyone
doing
&gt; upholstery repair for a living.
&gt;
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/mdelloca/PhotoAlbum7.html
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The old seats were down to springs and I got so used to it that I couldn't
&gt; believe the difference at first.  I did discover that the original padding
&gt; had foam sandwiched in between the horsehair (another VW special) which
the
&gt; repros didn't have so the repro seat padding is probably firmer than the
&gt; original.  I think they may last longer though before they disintegrate
into
&gt; &quot;tabacco&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; My final opinion: firm.
&gt;
&gt; I went with the horsehair because I'm a sucker for original and too many
&gt; messages in the archive said that foam overstuffed the seat.  The
horsehair
&gt; is a perfect fit especially if you are worrying about stressing the
original
&gt; fabric.
