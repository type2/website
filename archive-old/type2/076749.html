&gt; their bikini clad GEX chicks anywhere near a VW)
&gt; anywhere near my bus. I'd buy used before a HEX

&gt; &gt; Audacious peers,
&gt; &gt; Hello. I have been reading the (horror) stories
&gt; &gt; about GEX products in the 
&gt; &gt; archives, and since i recently put a set of the
&gt; &gt; larger valve (gex) heads on 
&gt; &gt; my 2.0L Type4 motor...I have come to question. So,
&gt; &gt; has GEX improved quality 
&gt; &gt; standards, or is the concensus still that they are
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; brand worth 
&gt; &gt; sidestepping? I've heard rumors that they often
&gt; &gt; charge for upgraded internal 
&gt; &gt; parts on turnkeys, that are not actually the
&gt; product
&gt; &gt; that you paid for. 
&gt; &gt; Should i hold my breath on these rebuilt heads?
&gt; &gt; What's the vote out there??
