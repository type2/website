Subject: FS 1970 Westy Northern Cal

Regretably Iam going to sell my 1970 Westy....I bought it 1 year ago ..has 
108,00 miles , bought it from original owner. He garaged it for 30 years, and 
me for the  last year. It has 23,00 miles on original German Block ( rebuilt 
at 85,00 by very good local machine shop  because it was getting alittle 
tired so PO says). Compression 124 on all 4 cylinders. I have changed oil 
every 700 miles and adjusted valves  every 1,500. PO says he did the same.  
Every thing works ..rear defroster, windshield washer, all the little things, 
has original curtains. . Has full Westy pop top with bunk. All westy parts in 
excellent shape. All interior in excellent shape. Exterior is in excellent 
shape, no rust. It has everything except child cot across front. Easily could 
be daily driver , although hate to see it get trashed. I would not be afraid 
to drive across country in it though.  I want $3,800 ..it's worth it. When 
you consider all the time and money you can throw into one of these ,and not 
have it as nice.. 
       It's a sad day in Paradise........Tom
