Subject: Engine dies   :(

On the way home yesterday sitting in traffic my bus died.

Towed home after fooling around with it some.

Here is what the bus does: It will fire up and run for a few seconds and
die. The starter is turning the engine. Pulled a plug wire and plug out and
it is sparking.

I figured it must be a fuel delivery problem. Pulled the fuel line off the
carb and cranking the engine only made the gas dribble out, so I changed the
mechanical fuel pump with another I had laying around. Same thing. So
because I wasn't sure if the extra I had worked I installed an electric fuel
pump that was on another bus I used to own. You can hear the pump work and
see the gas go through the little clear Bosch filter so it is getting gas to
the carb now, but the bus will not run. It won't idle and giving it gas does
not seem to help.

I have changed both the fuel filters and even all the fuel lines, except the
one from the tank to the filter, but the gas came pouring out when I
switched the pumps so its not clogged.

Do I have a carb problem or maybe something else? What should I check first?

So much for Fool Moon in Joon!

Thanks guys!! (a 6mm alan wrench will fit the T40 torx head nuts on the
mechanical fuel pump by the way)
