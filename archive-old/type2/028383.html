Andy, relax man, the asylum is not required. You have caught analog think
from your bus. A rare pleasure nowadays, cultivate it. Barry Wright.

&gt; I have to agree. There is a certain light near the studio where I often
&gt; have to make a quick stop while the engine is still cool and I can get the
&gt; oil light on occasionally. Actually I can pretty much guess my oil level
&gt; from how it behaves. It funny because there are stops before and after and
&gt; I kind of tinker with the idea that when the oil is thick it doesnt move
&gt; fast enough to starve the tube, when its warm it flows back quick enough
&gt; to not make a difference...Then theres the 'tween time.
&gt;
&gt; OK. Ill be checking into the Asylum now....
