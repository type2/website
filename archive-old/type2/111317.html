Subject: winshield wipers

my winshield wipers quit working sometime or another while the bus was sitting and being worked on..?
nothing to my knowledge has been shoved up in the dash

i have looked and everything looks as if it is in place and not bound or trapped by anything else...

here s what happens/..
i put the fuse in the spot for the windshield wipers...
it makes the very loud noise like the motor is stuck and not wineing but moaning really bad......

have to pull the fuse again really quick...
any ideas,,,
i am going to use some rain x and hope that it doesnt rain for High Country this weekend....
want to make sure i can possibly get the wipers to work?
they did work and worked good at one time so i am not sure what is wrong with them ... does it ring a bell to anyone ...?
anyone ever experienced this..?
is it the motor?
hmmm what else could it be?
thanks in advance..
peace
