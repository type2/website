Subject: Engine air pumps

All this discussion about engine air pumps... Has anyone ever owned one of
these beasts?  I've two. One in the 4x4 and one in the Riviera.  They use a
device that moves FRESH air into the tire (or whatever).  You don't have to
disable an injector, remove the fuel pump, drain the fuel tank...  You just
remove a spark plug, install the valve, add hose from valve to the tire (or
whatever), start the engine and wait about 20 minutes.  It fills the tire
(or whatever) with fresh air, and the fuel vapors go right out the
tailpipe.  Been using them for twenty-five years.  Just be prepared to wait
a while.  Especially with a 38/14.50x16.5 tire.

You guys are engineering this to death.  Go buy an Enginaire pump and be
done with it. Cepek sells 'em. Downey Toyota sells 'em. JCW sells 'em. I
think that even Harbor Frieght sells 'em.

Jim
