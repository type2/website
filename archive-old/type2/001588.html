&gt; By the way, if your pedastal pads are in bad shape, Wolfsburg West,
&gt; www.woflsburgwest_dot_com,  sells replacement pads that fit great for about
&gt; $30.00 for both sides.


I have 'em too.  Same item.  But be aware that there are separate outer
(under the seats) and inner (toward the insides of the seats) pedastal mats.
So if you're doing all of them you need a total of two sets. Also there were
minor year to year variations in the mats, so they are only an exact fit
for, I think, 76-79, although they will work on earlier walk-thru models as
well.
