&gt; I just ponied up the dough for a SVDA distributor from Aircooled_dot_net:

I can vouch that this distributor is a quality part. Although the
points that come with it suck!

&gt; I did this I'm tired of dealing with the 009/34PICT-3 combo on my upright 
&gt; engine now (bad idle, flat spots, etc.). I wanted to get the better advance 
&gt; characteristics of the mechanical and vacuum combination. Now I see that on 
&gt; the btlmex website they have an entire electronic ignition conversion kit 
&gt; for only a little bit more:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.btlmex_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=212

from the picture it sure looks like it's still a mech only advance.
You picked the correct part. You would still have hesitation with the
electronic setup (it just might burn cleaner)
&gt; 
&gt; So my question is, did I buy the wrong thing? Anybody have experience with 
&gt; the electronic conversion kit? I wish I had seen this sooner, I'd have just 
&gt; spent the extra $20 or so for this instead of just the better points 
&gt; distributor. Does this have a good advance curve, or does that even apply 
&gt; to an electronic ignition? Since this is computer controlled will it just 
&gt; always find the best time to spark?

I'd use the svda and put some sort of points replacement in. I use the
pertronix, but there was a recent discussion on the list about some
other options. (member of the I hate dealing with points club)
