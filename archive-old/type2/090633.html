&gt; These scoops will actually RAISE temps at slow speeds, since the purpose of
&gt; the vents is to allow hot air to escape, not to induct cool air.  I would
&gt; warn against them.

I doubt that air ever escapes from the vents, as there is a very hefty
squirrel-cage fan that continuously removes air from the engine bay, even
at idle.
