Subject: Re: [T2] heating a bus



&gt; Does anybody make new ones or rebuild these gas heaters? I have seen them
on
&gt; Ebay for $400+ dollars. I cannot afford this kind of dough for something
&gt; used and half worn out. Hate to just by junk. I would pay this price for
&gt; something new or rebuild with warrantee.
&gt;
Well for new they are asking $1000 + . http://www.espar_dot_com/... Someone in
the Midwest (I think one of the Buskatiers made a video on how to work on
your gas heater)  They were offering the tape for $19.95 if I remember
correctly.

Or if you have a friend in Cali, someone on vintagebus is always claiming
they can be had for $100...  Usually when someone else is trying to sell
theirs for more.  I have had my friends in Cali searching the swaps for over
a year now and they haven't seen a heater for that cheap yet.  But I have
seen them on the list for sale for $200-300... again that would be used,
original.
