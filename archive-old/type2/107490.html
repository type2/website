Subject: RE: [T2] %$##%#

Was written:

&gt;So anyhoo, BD lists the bolts, but no spacers or washers. Does anyone
know
&gt;if the dealer would have these? Are the spacers necessary (I can
probably
&gt;answer that myself)?

I redid my cv's about 5k ago and the new boots I bought came with the
curved spacers, grease, screws, but nothing to lock the screw. What I
did was use some lock-tight on the threads and in the holes (as
recommended by the boot manufacturer) and has held wonderfully. Maybe
you should think if redoing them especially if the ring is messed up or
bent and this time use lock-tight.
