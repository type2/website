Subject: 68-69 24&quot;x36&quot; wiring blueprints now avail.

Bob, list,

I just printed the 68-69 file on a 24x36 master copy from which I can now make blueprints.

I will work on the rest as I go.

As far a costs, I can put them in a tube so they won't be folded
(more expensive) or fold them up and put them in an envelope 
(less expensive) your choice.

To make it simple, lets say:

$10 for (2) blueprints folded
$15 for (2) blueprints tubed

I think this should cover materials/shipping fairly.

Billy

&gt;Hey Billy,
&gt;Now your talking. I for one would like to have a large copy like &gt;that.
