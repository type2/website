Is this the carb you have? http://www.larrysoffroad_dot_com/int22680.gif

My 73 bus also had a single carb conversion when I bought it and I just
replaced the carb with a new one. The above picture is of a weber DFEV
progressive which is most likly what you have. Your electric choke may look
a little different as well as the fuel intake connection might have a fuel
filter screwed right into the carb. If that is the carb you have, there are
two idle adjustments, a fast and slow. The fast is for when its cold and the
slow is for normal idle. The fast idle screw is behind the electric choke
assembly. The slow idle screw right near the shaft that the throttle linkage
connects to. You should be able to easly see it and adjust it through the
engine door (outside one). I'll have pictures on my website soon I hope.

I don't know anything about the distributor though...

&gt; Esteemed listees:
&gt;
&gt; I am posting to the VintagVW and type2 lists, with the hope that someone
can identify this carb and dizzy set up.  It came installed on the 1700 T-4
in my 72 Bus.  The carb is a single as opposed to the stock dual set up,
apparently a 2 barrel progressive.  Can't tell if it's Weber, Holley, what
have you, as I don't know how to tell the difference.  The number on the
base at the rear is R9877.  I searched the Type2 archives and didn't find a
reference to this number under Weber or Holley.  Also searched several
websites looking for a cross reference chart but didn't find one. Holley's
site lists model numbers, but I didn't find a 9877.
&gt;
&gt; I noticed while adjusting valves that the dizzy has a single vacuum line
to it, but the mark for Number 1 cyclinder is at the &quot;front&quot; (FIF) say about
11 o'clock, rather than at the back as I expected, and as the picture in
Muir shows.  In fact, it looks more like the Type 3 dizzy in the Muir book.
The Bentley pictue to me is not all that clear.  The number on the
distributor body is 326.  I'm not familiar with this, as my only other
experence is with the 009 in my Beetle.  What I found was that if I hooked
up the spark plug wires to the dizzy using the mark as number one, the
engine would not run.  Change them around to where they &quot;ought&quot; to be (One
at the &quot;back&quot; and Three at the &quot;front&quot;, 2 and 4 accordingly) and it runs,
though the timing is off.
&gt;
&gt; Which brings me back to the carb.  To set the timing, I tried to figure
how to adjust the idle, and couldn't see where the heck to adjust anything.
Before I go looking for a manual for the carb, though, I need to figure out
what I have.
&gt;
&gt; Any help?
&gt; Mike
