Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Failure

&gt;&gt;Could there still be
DOT 3 in my old crappy brake hoses
that is somehow mixing with the DOT 4?&lt;&lt;

yes, it is possible. but not to worry. DOT 3 &amp; DOT 4 are
compatible. (however, don't go back to DOT 3 now that you
are using DOT 4)

&gt;&gt;I'm pretty sure my rear brake hoses are CRAP --
 they're bubbling and don't
look too stable, so I'll be replacing
 them when I do the wheel cylinder --
but could this be why the brand
 spanking new wheel cylinder went south?&lt;&lt;

my best guess would be yes. if the hose is bubbling
you probably have some blockage going on in there.

good luck &amp; glad your journey was a safe one,
