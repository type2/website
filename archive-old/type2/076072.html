Subject: The '70 Westy

Well, the bus I've been asking all the questions about is finally being
started.  Rather than update people with my progress ( or long list of silly
mistakes ) I've decided to create a journal on the Version3_dot_net website.  If
you are interested in just how bad it is...  visit
http://www.version3_dot_net/type2/ to see how it is going.  It's just started,
so visit back.  WHEN I decide to tear out the camper top (and I will) there
will be a detailed description of the goings on found here.

Thanks for the help everyone had given so far!
