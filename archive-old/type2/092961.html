Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Some painting thoughts

What is the price for a gallon of the snowplow paint?

I have a use for basic paint from time to time.


&gt; &gt;And you could mix your own colors.
&gt;
&gt;Or get the store to do it.  Lowe's (local home builder place) sells what
&gt;the salesman called &quot;snowplow paint&quot;  -- it's tractor paint, dunno why in
&gt;heck they'd refer to it that way in rural north FL but anyway -- and
&gt;they'll mix it to any of the paint cards (hundreds of variations) for
&gt;their store-brand house paint.
