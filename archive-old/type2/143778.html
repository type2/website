Subject: Grating sound in Speedo

My speedometer (72 westy) makes a grating (or scraping) sound that gets louder 
the faster I go.

I took the instrumnet panel out last week to change a light bulb and check the 
wiper wiring, and now the sound is louder than before. The cable looks fairly 
well lubricated and it's not kinked or anything. Any idea how to cure this?
