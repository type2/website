Subject: [T2] Camper interior seats.

Hello again!  I have a 1970 Westfalia and I was wondering about the single 
seat behind the drivers seat.  It is a low back and I have never seen this 
before.  I have seen a 71 but it is raised but it is the same material ( that 
gold stuff.)  Mine is all ripped up because the previous owner used that area 
to crawl into the pop top.  Does any one have any ideas where to find one of 
these low back covers?  Or what years they were used?  Any info will help!  
thanks
Tim Edwards
70 Westy (Devon)
