Since it's Friday.. . .   There might be some Federal income tax advantages
from having a second home.  In some situations interest could be deductible.
Check with a reputable accountant.  Let's see now, let's compute the
interest on a $2000.00 purchase....

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;   Wanted to take a Friday opportunity to share  a unique (to me) DMV
thing.
&gt;   Went to the DMV to register my newly acquired 79 Westy.  Instead of
&gt;getting regular car (or truck) plates- Ms. DMV hands me &quot;motorhome&quot; plates.
I
&gt;explain that this is not a class A land yacht- just a small VW bus.
&gt;Besides, everyone I know with a Westy has regular car plates.
&gt;   She tells me that because it can be used as a &quot;temporary dwelling&quot;, it
is
&gt;now classified as a motorhome.
&gt;     BTW- I didn't tell them that it was a westy, but apparently some PO
must
&gt;have titled it as a motorhome or something. This is the only way I figure
&gt;they would have known. I don't know which plates PO had on it.
&gt;    This is a bummer for 2 reasons. First off, you surely know that
motorhome
&gt;plates are more expensive to get and maintain registration.  But secondly-
&gt;these plates in WI here are QUARTERLY. That means that the plates I just
got
&gt;expire in March already!  Car plates are yearly, of course.
&gt;    I have two ways out of this. I can either get &quot;collector&quot; plates, which
&gt;will cost more money, plus are more expensive for a &quot;motorhome&quot;, or, I can
&gt;somehow convince them to let me use regular car plates.
&gt;   Anyone else have to title their Westy as a camper? Or did I manage to
find
&gt;the one witty DMV worker here?
