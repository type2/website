Subject: Re: [T2] airtight engine compartment?

&gt;Perhaps someone can state which is the correct way to install it.  I left
&gt;the seam where the ends meet near the fan instead of by the firewall.

I put the seam at the front middle because I figured I wouldn't be drawing 
so much heated air off of the exhaust. I also noped it would draw as much 
dust.

My engine stays pretty clean.
