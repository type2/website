Not a survey. Just a thought to start your week.
Think about how cool it would be if your BUS had Audi's and or Ferrari's
Tiptronic Shifting.
You wouldn't have to reach for the stick if you had manual. Just shift at
the tip of your fingers. Gives you more dexterity to check out your gauges.

Later.
