Finally got around to taking stuff off a &quot;core&quot; engine bargain from Bus
Depot- #'s say 77 engine, but it had hydraulics-thought I could use the
harness, but the internal wires have BRITTLE insulation.  Not sure why
it was cored; turned over by hand.  Took off the cylinder tin, and it
had junk caked on the oil cooler, and in one corner over the cylinders
was a plug, a plug socket, and sundry broken plug connector bits and tip
for the #2 plug.  PO was sloppy?  Plugs were platinum.  Got one head
off; valves looked clean, looks clean on piston end and head pockets,
but has a nifty crack that spanned from/through exhaust port down to
valve seat. Guides seem not to have been replaced.  Valve tips looked a
bit worn.  Stamped on the side of the head it says GEX........

Someone please convince my wife that I need to replace the GEX motor 
that came with my westy? Thanks..

Tyler :-)
