&gt; How long did it take you guys to install the new torsion arms?

Your local guy is correct. I budget a full day, but I am strictly an
amateur.  It would probably be 4 hours for a pro.  You have to remove the
steering knuckle, sway bar, and bump stops, pull and put the arms,
reassemble and you're off.  The pain and cursing hidden in that sentence,
however, cannot be underestimated :-)

Go to the front axle beam page in the library for the whole deal.
