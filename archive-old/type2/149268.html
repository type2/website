&gt; Well, I ordered a new AMC head earlier today (from

I wonder why they only list their water cooled heads in their online  
catalog?

&gt; As an aside - gowesty recommend re-machining the AMC
&gt; heads and fitting better valves even when new (as a
&gt; couple of list members had already suggested),

I'm reminded that they have a webpage about that:

http://www.gowesty_dot_com/cylinderhead.html

I can't remember if they regrind the seat or replace them before  
grinding.

&gt; but my
&gt; vacation time constraints precluded this option. I'm
&gt; thinking I might drop the engine in a month or two,
&gt; and at that time buy another new AMC, get both of them
&gt; machined together, and do the job properly

The head will definitely last you longer than a vacation.
