&gt; I am. Actually, I am pretty much just geneally pissed.  I think it's a
&gt; sign of aging.  Years ago, I used to get bored with my elders complaining
&gt; about &quot;the youth of today&quot; and &quot;That plastic crap that breaks in five
&gt; minutes.&quot;  I am not ancient yet... the &quot;youth of today&quot; is no stupider
&gt; than I was at that age (they aren't any smarter, tho) but I am aging.
&gt; The &quot;plastic crap&quot; cliche gets truer and truer with every passing day.
&gt; On a Barndoor, you could (back in the day) get a rebuild kit for the shock
&gt; absorbers!!!  Transmissions were rebuildable at home.  Yes, you needed
&gt; micrometers and a press but a bench press was enough.  On the '67, I can
&gt; rebuild a lot of the bits myself.  &gt;
&gt; The initial attraction of VWs for me was that I could drop the engine and
&gt; hoist it onto the bench for a rebuild all by myself and actually *do* 90%
&gt; of the rebuild myself!   These days, it seems everything is a sealed unit.
I just
&gt; don't know what the world is coming to, but I do know that they can have
&gt; my aircooled bus when they pry it from my cold dead hand!
&gt;

Steve-

I couldn't agree more! My biggest complaint against so many of today's
products is that they are designed to be impossible for the consumer to
service.
&quot;Reliability&quot; is a frequent topic on this list, and I find that I have a
dual definition of the term. The first is the obvious one-- length of
service without repair or relacement. The second definition has to do with
the product being designed in such a way as to facilitate maintenance and
repair by the competent owner. Particularly the possibility of making
repairs under 'less than ideal' conditions, ie, on the side of the road.
When you find a product that meets both sides of the definition, such as our
beloved busses, HANG ON TO IT! Use it, take care of it; You won't go wrong.
By the way, for those of you who happen to own vehicles that can't be
repaired at home: If you take it to a shop and the first thing the mechanic
does is reach for a 'code reader'....RUN! That ain't no mechanic.

Dave, who is also beginning to feel his age and thinking of acting it.
maybe.
