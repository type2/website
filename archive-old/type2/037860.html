Subject: 74 Bus with FI?


&gt;
&gt; Yesterday while out driving around I found a 74 Bus in a feild and stoped
to see what the owner wanted to do with it. As it turns out the owner was
into VWs a few years back and has a lot of VW stuff in his yard he is going
to give/sell me. The Bus is a 74 and has had the engine and trans removed. I
will be striping it of more parts. What I found strange it that it was Fuel
Injection. It was also an Automatic. Now my 74 Kombi is Carbed and a 4sp.
Did they put FI in the Autos 1 year before the manuals? I looked it over
real close and it has all the factory brackets, control mod, and everything
for FI, and it has the same production date as my 74 carbed Bus. The date is
4/74. I know in the Bugs the Autostick got IRS a year before the manual, did
this happen with the FI on the Bus?
