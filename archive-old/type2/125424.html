Subject: Re: [T2] re: lowering a bus

I feel I am qualified to answer this question, as I own and built the
vehicle in question :)

&gt; When you say that it drives horribly, compared to what?

My other bus, a dead stock '79 Westy...

&gt; Any quantifiable terms?

Heck ya!

&gt;Does it turn any better?

No, it does not turn any better.

&gt;Does it lean as much?

No, it does NOT lean as much which is great for cornering and for highway
driving.

&gt;Is it as susceptable to gusts?

No, it is not. The lower stance decreases the amount of body roll that the
bus has under normal circumstances. A gust of wind is felt via a slight
pressure as opposed to an absolute movement.

&gt;looks very cool and drives like $hit.

Chris hit the nail on the head here. I will be the first and I have told
many that a lowered bus is NOT A GOOD RIDE !!!

I lowered this particular bus in 1994 and have pondered raising it back up
for years, just never have.

FACT: A lowered bay window is a blast to drive as long as their are no
bumps. The front end travel is ludicrous and produces a very bouncy ride....

I drive the bus because its there, it runs perfect, and I have a
relationship with it.

Would I lower another bus?

Yes, but only with air.......
