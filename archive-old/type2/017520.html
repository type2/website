Subject: Heading For Maine!!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Everyone--

Well just wanted to thank everyone for all the help these past couple weeks. 
Heading for Maine this afternoon--looking to make the trip in a couple days 
but no need to rush. Have my AIRS list in hand and the bus is running 
good--just have to beat the next NorEaster heading for the Northeast. Thanks 
again for all the help--and maybe I'll catch you on the road---Adam
