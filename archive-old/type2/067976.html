Subject: Re: Do Beetles Float??  A VofA story [F]

 
Greetings--

I'm having trouble bonding with the editor on the news reader at my new
site, so I've been unable to post this on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled.
On that group there was a thread recently about the [in]famous one-liner: 
&quot;If Ted Kennedy had been driving a Volkswagen, he'd have been President by
now.&quot; 

I thought since it was Friday I'd share this little behind-the-scenes
story.  As many of you probably already know, that line was the punchline
of one of National Lampoon's most famous advertisement parodies during the
mag's golden age of the early 1970s. The parody ad, in most ways
completely indistinguishable from other VW ads, or from other &quot;real&quot; ads
in the same magazine, showed a VW beetle bobbing in the water, with the
now-famous line below it. [Wording may have been slightly different from
the quote above, but only slightly.]

In 1976, I heard P.J. O'Rourke give a public talk in which he told the
story about that. O'Rourke was editor of NatLamp at the time of the
Kennedy/VW &quot;ad,&quot; and at the time he spoke he still was [or had very
recently stepped down, I forget which]. 

Well, explained O'Rourke [whose love of Kennedy apparently hasn't mellowed
in twenty years], the Kennedys had nothing to say about NatLamp's little
jape, but Volkswagen of America was mightily pissed.  They immediately
slapped a lawsuit on NatLamp for several million dollars--which is to say,
several million dollars more than the struggling little shoestring
operation behind NatLamp could possibly have paid.  The NatLamp lawyers
came back to VofA: Please, isn't there something else we can to to atone
and make amends? 

VofA--which apparently didn't know much about the publishing biz--relented
and said they'd drop the suit *if* the following conditions were met:  (a)
NatLamp would print an apology. [No problem, figured O'Rourke; a
paragraph's worth of ink doesn't cost us anything.] And (b) NatLamp would
get all the copies of the issue in question off the newsstands as soon as
possible.  Well, hedged NatLamp, will you give us two weeks?  VofA agreed. 

Of course, even in ordinary circumstances a monthly magazine is pretty
much off the stands in 2-3 weeks anyway, and the added publicity of the ad
and the law suit meant that there really weren't any copies left to be
picked up. 

So O'Rourke and National Lampoon figure they got out of a nasty seven-
figure law suit from Volkswagen of America by doing nothing, basically,
except sounding very very contrite. 

No political point to make; I'm just relaying the story as it was told to
me.  Though personally I think both Kennedy and O'Rourke were funnier in
those days.  But that could be just me.
