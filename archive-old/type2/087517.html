Subject: white stag tent still in biz?

because my free tent came from a westfalia, and i knew zilch about tents
until fully understanding joe clark's tent page i believe this model to be
from white stag. anyone know if white stag is still making tents? in the
pacific NW, anywhere? seems like my tent now has grown the side poles -
telescoping w/button stops. now all i need is the top rails. how's that for
motivation to get the engine in?   -steve
