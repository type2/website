Subject: Enough already...

Ron and Listees;
   Enough of this bull pucky. I know the system Ron deals with. If you
want
quality at a decent price you need to have patience. Things get FUBAR'ed
in
every endeavor. Shjt, happens.
   Sometimes I get the feeling that instant gratification is the driving

force
today. Sit back, think things through.
   I needed a left side battery tray for my still undergoing surgery '78

Westy.
Ron delivered, after a while. But not one other distributor could even
find
the
dang thing except those brothers in Great Britain. Guess where Ron got
it
from?
(Likely at a cost to him.)
   I'm pleased with the service.
   If you don't like it, ask the folks at Wally-World for a '78 Vw Bus
left-side
battery tray.

&gt; &gt; I have been trying to get a problem resolved for
&gt; &gt; over a month and a half.  After several phone calls of being put on
&gt; &gt; ignore and 5 or more email messages,
&gt; &gt; I finally had to get the CC co. to dispute the charge to get any one

&gt; &gt; to even respond to me.
&gt;
&gt; You know what, this is just about the last straw.
&gt;
&gt; Let's deal with the actual facts here rather than fiction.  Mari
mistakenly
&gt; told you that an oil pump she was writing him up for was not a
Melling.
She
&gt; was wrong; it was the same Melling that Motorworks and just about
everyone
&gt; else is shipping.  Honest mistake (and one that she will not make
again).
&gt; You INSTANTLY griped about it publicly to the Type 2 list. (Not &quot;over
a
&gt; month and a half&quot; ago, but 3 weeks ago. I have the dated email.)   You

then
&gt; emailed us to say that you wanted to return it.  NO PROBLEM!   Jerry
&gt; apologized for the error, instructed you to return the pump, and
offered
not
&gt; only to refund your full purchase price but ALSO to reimburse standard
US
&gt; mail rates for your return postage expense. And indeed you did send it

back.
&gt;
&gt; My store manager, Dan, also followed up personally with a phone call,
at
my
&gt; request, and left you a message to return his call. You confirmed
having
&gt; gotten his message in a later email, but instead of returning his call

you
&gt; threatened to contest the charges on your card - why I don't know,
since,
by
&gt; your own account, we had ALREADY offered you you not just a full
refund
but
&gt; ALSO reimbursement for standard return postage!  Dan once again left
you
a
&gt; message just yesterday.  Yet today you are again griping.  Seems we
are
&gt; being more than fair in handling the return.   We immediately agreed
to
take
&gt; back the part, issue a full refund, and reimburse return postage.   I
don't
&gt; know what more you could possibly want.
&gt;
&gt; I would be more than happy to forward to the list absolute
incontrovertable
&gt; proof of the above, which I have in the form of Steve's own emails
from
his
&gt; own computer. But I hardly think this is the appropriate forum.
&gt;
&gt; This is really getting ridiculous.  Someone else who bitched during
this
&gt; free-for-all complained that he called and could not get an answer on
&gt; whether he order had shipped.  It was because he called the
orders-only
&gt; line, so they indeed could not answer his question, instead referring
him
to
&gt; the correct number. When I POLITELY explained this, he responded by
calling
&gt; me a jackass.
