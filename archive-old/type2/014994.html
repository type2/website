Isaiah and other volks:

It is possible to replace the coils in the 6 v heater with 12 volt coils
and have a 12-volt heater. This is documented more thoroughly somewhere in
the archives, but the basic idea is just as I described. My understanding
is that the fan is durable enough to run on 12 volts, albiet a little faster.

The problem with the 6 volt heaters is more often fuel lines and old wiring.

Have fun! Joe
