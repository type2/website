Subject: Just an FYI

I've personally sat in and seen two walk thru panels.  One a good friend
of the family owns, it's a 66.  The second a fellow club member owns
here in the northwest, it's a 58 and was once used by the Singer sewing
machine co as a delivery van.  Walk thru panels are rare but don't
command much more money than a regular panel, mainly cause they are
deafeningly loud. A double door panel brings in the big bucks.  I have
seen a picture of a walk thru panel made into a camper, but it was one
of the camp of America models with the cheesy interior. Talking of
campers, Joe Clark mentioned the hole in the tops of the Westfalia
campers being Sunroof holes.  This is correct for some of the early
bubble window Westfalias.  The 65-67 and even the pre 64 sub-hatch
models had a VW factory stamped hole with a crimped edge.  The later 70s
Westys had their own specially designed roof.  Half of it is flat to
accommodate the upper bed.  

Hurray!!! death to the Tent sting, may it go down in flames!!! (snicker
:-D)
