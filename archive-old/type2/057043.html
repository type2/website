Subject: that round door thing...sheesh...

Volks:

I was doing some work on the sliding door in my '71,
and for reasons which are too stupid to innumerate, I
misplaced that round thing that fits above the front
edge of the door in the track.  Know what I mean?
Anyone have one?  Anyone know where I can get one?

I was just thinking: bus is running great, new tranny,
engine, brakes, clutch, etc., and then I do something
like this...I think I am the high maintainance vehicle
in this relationship....

TIA, 

Dan
