Did they mention how many batteries this thing has or how long
they or the alternator lasts at Full Tilt Boogie...?-(
One thing's for sure...You won't hafta worry about heat...Just tuck
a few of those power amps under your seat (or cook hot dogs on
the heat exchangers...;-(
Hey, you know the physics involved...You gotta have a mega-watts
to push all those bass cones... ;-(
