&gt; 
&gt; Why not?  It is this one. [Scroll down to the bottom where it gives the idle
&gt; specs, it lists it for manual trans and auto trans] :

I have seen it only listed for the manual tranny, I'm pretty sure that is
what I have got in there but I thought there was a different one for the
auto tranny
I do still have the speed limiting rotor
have Pertronix point eliminator system
