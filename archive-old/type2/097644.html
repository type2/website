&gt; &gt;Crank is DPR, not DPS, 74mm, not 73mm

&gt; good point - but rimco clearly states 'clearanced for 73' on 
&gt; invoice.... maybe why i had to do extra clearancing?

Uh, yeah. Rimco ???!

&gt; my local shop buddy said drive it for 25 miles (gingerly!) and then 
&gt; drain oil. look for shavings. if none, it ain't internal - hopefully!
&gt; if metal, apart it goes.

Nope, drive it till it breaks ( sooner than you think :)
OR fix it till it breaks:)
Sounds like a clearance issue is not resolved.
You need to solve this puzzle as soon as possible-
I want to order a couple of those new aluminum type1 cases !
