Subject: Rear heat heater cable

Last night in an attempt to get my walkthrough heat working, I broke the
heater cable at the dash side. 

 

What is the part number and is it still available? 

 

I might be able to rig something up, but the funky looped back wire at the
end is going to be tricky.

 

Specifics: This is the cable on my '78 Westy that opens/closes the flap that
redirects hot air to the rear passengers via the vents on the walkthrough.
It is controlled by the left dash lever.

 

Thanks,

 

Jon Stiles
