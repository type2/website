Subject: RE: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages



&gt; 	From what I have pieced together, the .009 was=20
&gt; originally favored as
&gt; a &quot;performance upgrade&quot; by the racing crowd.  Since most of=20

When I bought my first VW (type I) in the 80s, the .009 was touted
as a &quot;High Performance&quot; by the ads in the VW rags, as well as by
friends and such.  I seem to remember the .009 being a desirable
dizzy at the time.  My VW friends at the time (as well as myself)=20
believed whatever the mags said, we were just young teenagers on
the east coast in a small town with no VW shops to gleen knowledge
from, and of course there were no email lists.  It wasn't until the
early 90s that I joined a type I email list and first heard bad things
about the .009.

&gt; still enjoy popularity.  You would probably be hard pressed=20
&gt; to find a FLAPS
&gt; without a cap, points and condenser for the .009 in any=20
&gt; location.  Trying to
&gt; find these parts for a stock vacuum dizzy can be a much more=20
&gt; trying, and
&gt; often more expensive process.

Hmm, last time I picked these parts up for my type I, the FLAPS guy
didn't ask me what dizzy I had, I just assumed these parts must
be interchangable (I have vacuum advance on a 1500 SP engine.)  Do
I have the wrong parts installed? It seems to run fine, and the parts
weren't pricey.
