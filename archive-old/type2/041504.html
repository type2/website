Subject: VW mechanic shops in Saugus, CA

I'm going to need a VW shop to check my bus before I start north to the
Frisco area. I found the following:

German Auto Center, Inc.
23051 Drayton Street
Saugus CA 91350

Does anyone know this place? Do they work on VWs? Does anyone have a
mechanic in the Saugus area that they can recommend?
