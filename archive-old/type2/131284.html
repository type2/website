Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Seating Question

My 1973:
Driver, passenger, jumpseat, two in the bench seat. 5 total. All have seat
belts in mine.

I'm adding another jump seat behind the front passenger seat where the
sink/fridge was. A fold up one like in the extended cab S-10 pickups.
That'll make 6 for me.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I am trying to figure out how many can sit in a Westy, And I am
&gt; trying to make up my mind on if you get more in a 74 - 75 westy, than a
&gt; 68 - 73 and  76-79. Also, Do seatbelts come for the Jumpseat on a 68 -
&gt; 73 and if not, is it a good idea to fit them, and have someone ride
&gt; there. OR, is the jumpseat just for when people are eating in the back?
