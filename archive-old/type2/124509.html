Subject: Re: [T2] Strange water leak in bus

Thanks, Andy and Mike. No sunroof and no vent wing on that side. What is
strange is that the floor is dry near the outer wall of the bus. And as I
said, I looked under the vinyl panel and no water there. The water is
appearing more to the center of the bus near the inner part of the wheel
well. I will have to try the hose method of troubleshooting.

| &gt; When it

wall

| &gt; to the floor.
