E-Z BLEED Power Brake Bleeding Tool, uses a low pressure air source, such
as
from a spare tire (I usually just hook it up to the tire closest to the
Master Cylinder as it doesn't use much air) and it will pressurize the
entire brake system. All you have to do is crack open the bleeder screws
one
at a time and the fluid comes out nice and quick. Comes with 6 popular
master cylinder adapter caps and fits most vehicles. If you like I can have
our publishing dept send you an image of the bleeder for reference. Let me
know.

The part # is WS4062 $28.50 ea.

Thanks for your inquiry,


Scott Hart c/o ipd Co.
