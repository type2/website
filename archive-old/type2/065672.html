Last weekend I went to Grand Prairie, Texas to play paintball.  The two
young ladies running the place had a white Toyota panel van to carry all of
the gear in, to which they had added a fake but very realistic looking
machine gun sticking out of the front beneath the windshield.  It looked
like the front of the mini-gun that Schwarzenneger used in T-2.  I asked
them if cops hassled them about it and they said &quot;no, but people sure get
out of our way in a hurry&quot;.  Only in Texas could people get away with stuff
like this!  I thought it was hilarious, but I'm not brave enough to do it
to MY bus...
