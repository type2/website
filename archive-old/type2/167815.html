  This appears to show roughly 10 m of finned piping.  Now let's hear 
from Bussi &amp; other waterwankers  -  finned copper (or Al) piping from 
&amp; back to the motor could get rid of a similar thermal power, 
couldn't it?  These 2 pipe runs would be, per m, more efficient than 
a raft of hot pipes radiating onto each other.

*  Run just above the bottom metal shield which has good holes (&amp; 
could be improved to take in more air);

*  add a couple layers of fine-mesh chicken wire to protect against rocks

*  slap small radiator behind front bumper, invisible from outside, 
with flap-duct in floor to let warm air into cab when wanted

*  slow traffic will probably be worst condition; may then need to 
slap in a 12 V fan in front of or  -  this will show youse I learned 
Yank while living amongst them  -  in back of the radiator

*  water will still be hot enough for heating the cab by the small 
protected radiator, after its run fw, and cool enough upon arrival 
back at engine, if my intuition turns out correct.

I strongly disapprove of water (and even more, oil) radiators outside 
structures which are needed to protect them  -  and to protect 
pedestrians.  For that matter, I disapprove of water-cooled motors. 
Indeed I had better claim this is a Friday msg. (I have to be out of 
town this Fri).
