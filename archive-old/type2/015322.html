Howard, I apologize for trying to think before I had my mind reved up
this morning. Do check the several additional responses where I noted
my errors. Someone suggested I &quot;berated&quot; you. Please know that was not
my intent. I don't think you did anything wrong. You did what 90% of
us apes walking around this planet would have done.

Just this week I was preparing to service a Bay that I hadn't seen since
94. Battery was down some so I went to hook up the charger. It has been
sitting for a year waiting for the scratch to replace the tranny. I noted
the new battery right off, then proceeded to hook up the charger back
asswards. The charger has a safety feature so no harm was done. Anyway,
I hooked it up then went in the shop to look up the maintenance and
repair history and sure enough, 6 years ago on an invoice was noted,
&quot;Non spec. battery cables.&quot; The stock ground is of course black. This
one, like so many others, was replaced with a red one. Mind on autopilot
and ZAP.

Which just goes to show, none of us gets it right all the time. I should
have read the history first, then checked out the vehicle. If I was perfect
I would just go to God, cause no one could afford me and my work here would
be done. Understanding this makes me causious as hell. I know fer shur that
if I don't pay attention to the details, I could fry that $2000 fuze box
in the Maseratti. That's also why I carry insurance, cause I am capable of
being culpable.

Best regards, and let me know if your having any problems while you
spend your leisure time up-fixing that bus.

PS: I won't post this to the list but if you would like to you may.
