&gt; At 1000 rpm there is no hunting. Dwell is at 44, but I'm not sure how to
&gt; adjust this. Is this a matter of adjusting points? I adjusted the points per
&gt; spec. I am used to a pointless ignition, so dwell is something new to me.

As points age, the amount of gap they need to get tp 50 degrees dwell
becomes less and less. A new set requires .016&quot; gap; I always change them
when the gap becomes less than .010&quot;.

Of course, you could always send The Bus Depot or aircooled_dot_net a few
dollars and come away with a points eliminator, which will solve this
problem for good.
