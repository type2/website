&gt;&gt;  In NZ we have had to pay closer attention
&gt;&gt;  to 'octane ratings' because Mobil &amp; Bechtel
&gt;&gt;  foisted on us a synfuels factory which made from
&gt;&gt;  natural gas peculiarly poor petrol (and is now
&gt;&gt;  mothballed).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Heavens! That wouldn't be the same Bechtel in-
&gt;volved with the still-leaking Big Dig in Boston and
&gt;multi-million dollar cost overruns in Iraq, would it
&gt;... ?-(

	Same gang.  One of the worst.  There are several good books 
on this largest private corporation.  When I was back in the USA 
during 1983 Bechtel announced they were purging  -  sorry, letting go 
-  a couple thousand employees; that stripped them down to 43,000.
	Polite society in the San Francisco bay area would not eat a 
meal with Stephen Bechtel, last I heard.  Top Bechtel executives 
Shultz &amp; Weinberger &quot;starred&quot; in the Reagan cabinet.

	The Motunui plant was a 1400x-scaleup from a lab-bench pilot 
plant.  We were the guinea-pigs for a considerable gamble.  It 
includes the world's biggest methanol factory, output originally used 
in the now-mothballed Mobil section polymerising methanol in a 
zeolite catalyst to a form of petrol plus LPG byproduct.  The petrol 
looked like low-octane unleaded but was never marketed as such  - 
probably because, like the Sasol product, it is peculiarly liable to 
hi-speed knock which can melt holes in your pistons.  (Those with 
knock-sensors may achieve automated retard even tho' they can't hear 
the knock; but that will tend to cause general overheating, as well 
as costing you power.)
	Mobil have a concept to create dozens of similar factories 
making similar petrol from open-cast coal in the region of Montana. 
Anyone concerned to get decent fuel should investigate where such 
concepts have got to.  The standard transnational bureaucrats' chant 
is:
		 In reality, the price of alternatives to oil as the 
base feedstock for transportation fuel - such as tar sands and coal - 
are already competitive when the oil price is in the range of $25 - 
$40 a barrel.
	I therefore issue this warning to those better placed in N. 
Amer. to watch out for Mobil's junk petrol (they will probably call 
it 'gasoline' but don't let that put you off the scent  ;-).  If 
youse over there in the bowels of the monster detect them trying it 
on in the vicinity of Missoula, do slap the spotlight on the quality 
of the proposed product.
