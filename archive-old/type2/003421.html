Subject: Looking for different helicoil/threadsert options.
Date: Tue, 20 Feb 2001 18:01:32 -0500

Mechanical question.  No VW content, but definitely is info that could help
someone someday.

Working on a car in the garage,_at_ bolt hole threads(6mX1) are stripped that
hold the timing belt tensioned.  Break out the helicoil kit, one goes in
perfect, the other is screwed up.  Drilled next size up, and cannot line up
the tap.  My  thought is I drilled the hole crooked, no telling.

I am running out of metal to drill.  Is there something sort of like a case
saver I can screw in that will work?   If so where can I find it?
