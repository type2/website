Subject: VW Show In Prescott (Northern), Arizona THIS WEEKEND.
Message-ID: &lt;19990511041448.25291.rocketmail_at_web117.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hey All,

Just attended my first meeting for the
&quot;Flat-Four-Fetish&quot; VW club here in Prescott, Az. Come
to find out that they are sponsoring a VW show here
next weekend! 

There will be a Road-Rally and free street show on
Saturday. On Sunday, there will be a judged show
($3.00 fee for pedestrians, only $5.00 to show your
car!!!!) with $2,500.00 in raffle-prizes &lt;proceeds go
to a local charity&gt; and a swap-meet as well &lt;again,
only $5.00 if you want a space to sell/swap your
stuff&gt;.

Now, this IS going to be a relatively small show,
but....there are plans for a &quot;flyover&quot; of 3 light
planes flying in low formation over the show on Sunday
(try doing THAT in L.A.!!!)....did I mention this show
takes place in the middle of downtown?!? 

I understand the formidable &quot;Uncle Jerry Jess&quot; will be
there and look forward to meeting him.  


I hope some of you can make it! Look for a guy with a
white '69 Westy Poptop with Oregon license plates and
that's me! 


Anyone that needs more info, P-mail me....



Jaime
