Subject: Turn signal switch and type 2 models
Date: Sat, 14 Nov 1998 03:23:05 PST

Hey Y'all,
  I am looking for a turn signal switch for my 70 Bus. I know that the 
68-71 will work. 72 and up will not ( I have one of these)  I don't need 
the metal housing just the switch. If you have one please e-mail me and 
let me know how much, shipping should not be much because its fairly 
light and small so anywhere in the U.S. is fine. Even overseas is O.K. 
if the price is right I suppose.
  I am also looking for a model of a type 2. I want a bay window and 
would prefer a 68-72 but will concider 73-79 also. If you know of anyone 
making one or have an old one let me know. I found a nice Vanagon one 
with U.N. trim made by Revell that looks good, but I realy want a Bay 
window.
