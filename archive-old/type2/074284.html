Subject: Re: [T2] Tire sizing to gear down tall tranny for 75?

To George, Greg, et al-
Hmm, wonder where I got the idea that 205 tires were smaller but fatter
than 185s??  I was at Volk Tire yesterday and they said they have a pair
of Continentals (185 tires), 6ply rating, for $80 each- I didn't know
these were still available and is that an OK price??   So you are saying
(George) if there is NO number after the width like 75, the aspect ratio
is 82?  I'm riding a pair of Warrior tires in back (8PR, 65 lbs max
pressure) and Mich xzx, 45 lbs max, 6PR in front.  The difference in
crosswinds after driving over 180K on 1540 rated load range D passenger
tires were noticable- much less side sway!
