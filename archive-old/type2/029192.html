I am following Ron Van Ness's lead and his excellent write up and redoing
my 71 Bus shiftrod and nosecone.  The writeup is excellent and a HUGE help
(Thanks Ron!), I really just have some parts questions that I am hoping
someone can help me with.

My first question is with the shift rod bushings.  Apparently Jim Thompson
was the only US supplier of the rear shift rod rear bushing (211 711 185B)
but I had heard and was told when I called that they no longer sell
parts...  Does anyone know where I could get this and the other bushings
needed in the US?  Ron mentioned that Just Kampers has alot of stuff but I
am concerned about the time it may require to get here from the UK... (no
experience with overseas shipping)

My second question is the rubber dust cover for the inner shift lever aka
hockey stick (211 301 289A).  Mine was in several pieces and I think that
dust and dirt played a major role in marring up my hockey stick and
jumbling my shifting.  They are no longer available but Ron mentioned that
(211 711 115A) is listed as a suitable replacement in the 79 fiche he duge
up.  I have never seen this part and was wondering if anyone had any
experience with it?

Anyone with sloppy shifting (years 68-75 are similar) should read Ron's
article (http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm).  I am really looking
forward to feeling the results of the work and getting things back to spec.

Thanks in advance for the help, this list is the best and I am so happy
it's back up.  Thanks to all who helped bring it back and to those that
keep it up.

- Brian
71 Bus
