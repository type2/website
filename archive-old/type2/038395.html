this is probably a 71 bus/late bug/autostick distributor.  rebuilt with a
single vac can instead of dual vac for ease of use, and because dual vac
cans are $50 and single vac $15.  This is the redheaded stepchild of
swapmeets and VW shops, no-one wants the dual vac dizzies.  I have a few,
all purchased for $5 or less.  2 good ones.  Learn how to identify a good
dizzy, and save some money. (done by feel, i cant explain have a good VW
buddy who knows show you... or wobble the shaft on a new distributor up
and down and side to side, see how that feels, look for a used one as
close to that as possible...)

&gt; The pertronix ignitor comes in two versions.  One for the dual advance 
&gt; dist.'s and one for the .009 dist.'s.  The unit will have the same positive 
&gt; effect on either dist.  It WON'T cure the hesitation problem and fuel economy 
&gt; associated with the .009.  These problems are a result of the advance curve 
&gt; of the .009 and a lack of vacuum advance on initial acceleration.  You get 
&gt; what you pay for ; )

009's only hesitate with 34 pict 3's, in my experience, and that problem
can be cured im told as well.  I have a 009 on a 1600dp with a h30/31 pict
(bocar) and have no hesitation problem. I have a german 009 on my 61, and
a 34, it hesitates but i am going to try the infamous &quot;pop rivet&quot; fix
before springing for a new carb... maybe i'll change back to vac advance,
i dunno... just tinkering along.

take care,

Steve
