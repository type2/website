Subject: closing sliding door

I am just wondering what the correct way to close my
sliding door is?
I have a 77' bus and the only 2 ways I can get it to shut
from the outside is to slam it or slowly close it keeping
the handle down and pushing hard on the back of the door
so it pulls in to make it lock in place.

If I slowly close it the back part of the latch on the door
pushes it back open.

What do I do to close it without damaging anything?

Alex,
