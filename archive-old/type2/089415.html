Subject: [T2] Valve guides


&gt;I asked a local machine shop how much they would charge for a valve job on a
&gt;Nissan 240SX head.

It won't fit on a bus engine very well, if at all.

&gt;Now I am embarrassed by my feeble efforts to 'rebuild' my extra two type 2
&gt;2.0 liter heads. (from a '77, scheduled for a '78)

&gt;(1) elbow_grease_style clean the two heads (8-10 hours invested so far) and

Good.Now do the other head.

&gt;(4) lap the valves (like I know what I am talking about, right !?!?!?)

Lapping is fine tuning. It won't produce the result required to
make the valve concentric with the new guide. Seats must be cut.

&gt;Well, I ordered the valve guides and valves and I am ready to go.  However,
&gt;some little bird (C&amp;M Machine shop Alexandria VA) said that if I press in
&gt;ANY valve guides, I MUST regrind the valve seats.  This is because the valve
&gt;guides never go in like the old ones that came out, and will be off
&gt;centered.  ( never go in - comments ??)

New guides must be reamed to sixe, and seats cut to
center the valve on the seat as well as to provide the
correct seat width. The old valve has pounded on the
seat for along time, it gets to be too wide.
The seat cut can also adjust the sealing surface area
up or down to put it where it should be.

&gt;So, if the valve guides do NOT have to be replaced, then don't!!  Measure
&gt;the lateral movement of the valves per Bentley, don't replace them
&gt;automatically. I thought you would ALWAYS replace the valve guides, even if
&gt;they were in spec.  Just to have a set of heads that were as new as
&gt;possible.  ( always replace - comments ??)

The intake guides are often fine, they just don't wear as fast as the exhausts.
Valve rock will be less for new valves, so measuire it with one.

&gt;Another piece of advice is to fly cut the type 2 heads _at_ $35 each.  But I
&gt;look at these heads and why can't I just use the $.99 head gaskets, properly
&gt;RTV'ed onto the heads?? Won't this provide the proper seal, just as well as
&gt;fly cutting?  ( don't fly cut - comments??)

Flycut to repair compression loss or defect in that area.
Or to raise comprtession ratio ( it makes the chamber smaller.)
Don't use the head gasket, add base shim. VW recommends it.
Try lapping in the cylinders with paste. Just turn them in the head.
Be sure no paste is left there for assembly, it will destroy the P/C.

&gt;And I am not, not, not going to replace the '77 solid lifter valve springs
&gt;with '78 hydraulic lifter valve springs because I really do want to save
&gt;some money, and I don't plan to rev the engine high enough to get float.  (
&gt;use solid lifter valve springs - comments??)

You only need enough valve spring to keep them from float.
More spring is good for optional cams with higher lift.
Hydraulic springs will nicely complement the  ability to put
hydraulic lifters on a solid lifter cam. Many fewer valve adjustments
and nicer looking knuckles. Valves always in tune, longer-lasting engine.


&gt;And not, not, not replace the valve keepers, only because I can't find them
&gt;at Bus Depot ( valve keepers - comments??)

Keepers ? Keep them, if they are good.
That's why they call them keepers.
Bad ones you will know when you see one.

&gt;And yes, install those little valve seals because they are only $.44/ea at
&gt;Bus Depot and I guess I can afford $3.52 ( little valve seals - comments??)

Those seals seal off every time the valve closes.
Not much of importance when the heads are new,
their value is on an aging head when the valve guides
wear, and you start to see smoke from worn guides.
Unfortunately, that is about the time these seals get hard,
crack, and fall out into the sump. Viton is the cure.

&gt;And humorous comments are optional.

Processing. I think a picture of those hand-cleaned heads will do it for me :)
