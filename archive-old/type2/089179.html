Subject: Re: [T2] gas leaking at fuel injector

[...]

I just tried blowing thru a fuel pump from the tank side: no flow.
I just tried blowing thru a fuel regulator from the tank side: no flow.

This tells me one of yours is bad. You will need to determine the direction
your drip is coming from....
Unfortunately, I find no specs for fuel pressure after stopping the pump. All
the specs are for pump/engine running. It would be nice to know how much and
how long the rail should be pressurized. That would help for locating
leaks.....

If you have a problem locating replacements, I have them.

&gt; Last night I removed one of my fuel injectors to
&gt; exchange it today. I thought that as long as the pump
&gt; was not operating, I would only get a residual drip
&gt; after I disconected the injector and it would stop.
&gt; This morning, I went to the bus and noticed that gas
&gt; was still dripping out. It had been doing this all
&gt; night. Is this normal?
