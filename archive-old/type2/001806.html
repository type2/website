Quoted from yesterday's digest:

&gt;&gt;Then you will see
the exhaust valve open and close. Just as the exhaust closes the intake will
start to open. Stop. At the point of the exhaust closing and the intake
opening #1 should be at TDC and your timing mark should be on zero. &gt;&gt;

Being somewhat new to these engines, this statement raised my question: how
much valve overlap is designed into these cams?  Following the above
statement on some engines you could be as much as say 10 degrees ATDC if you
wait for the exhaust valve to close after the intake opens.  Or you could be
as much as say 10 degrees BTDC if you go by the intake valve just beginning
to open.
