&gt; &gt;I did some research this morning. The 63-67 Bentley shows three
&gt; different
&gt; &gt;types of torsion bars, a standard, one softer bar for Ambulance use
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;another type for Fire Trucks. The 68-79 manual mentions no
&gt; alturnatives.
&gt; 
&gt; According to legend, there are actually two torsion bars for 68-79...
&gt; ones
&gt; w/ red paint on em for normal kombis, sedans, etc; one with brown or
&gt; green
&gt; (forget) to signify beefier camper torsies. Or were the colors
&gt; reversed?
&gt; Anyways, as every bus I have ever stripped was a hard-top camper or a
&gt; sedan, all I've ever seen are the red ones.

The 68-79 Bentley lists four different bars with differing diameters
but identical lengths.

68-71 station wagons got 26.2mm bars and the spring plates were
adjusted to between 23 degrees and 23 degrees 50 minutes.

All other 68-71s got 28.1mm bars and the spring plates were adjusted to
between 21 degrees 10 minutes and 22 degrees.

72-up station wagons got 26.9mm bars and the spring plates were
adjusted to between 23 degrees and 23 degrees 50 minutes.

All other 72-ups got 28.9mm bars and the spring plates were adjusted to
between 20 degrees and 20 degrees 50 minutes.

Apparently, the bars were made beefier for the Type 4 engine.  Station
wagons probably got lighter bars (and more preload) to give a better
ride when lightly loaded.

If you've put a heavier engine into a bus, you'd be best off with the
bars from a late model Westy, panel, or Kombi.  You will still need to
experiment to find the best setting.

&gt; The local salvage yard sells the others when they have them, but at
&gt; $80_at_
&gt; I'll just sag a little.

You don't need to sag!  Just adjust the bars you have and you'll be
nice and level.  I did it to my '71 and it's well worth the effort. 
I've not heard of breakage problems except in the case of bars being
heavily preloaded.
