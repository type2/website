Subject: painting your own

I stopped painting in garages after covering my buddies-dads garage in black
paint.  We painted my old station wagon in his dads garage with no
ventilation, and to keep the dust down we hosed down the floor.  After that
project, and getting kicked out of the garage, we bought a couple rolls of
clear plastic and a bunch of 2x4s.  We built a paint booth and put in an old
attic fan for ventilation. To keep the fumes to a minimum, we threw a couple
of furnace filters in front of the fan.
A side benefit was that it got hotter than heck inside during the summer and
would help &quot;bake&quot; the paint on. Of course, the lawn never recovered in that
spot.
I do sometimes wonder what happened with the old setup. If I had to do it
over again, I'd buy one of the big portable garages at Costco and modify
that.
