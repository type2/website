I'm thinking that spraying up from inside with one of the rust stablilizing
paints, then filling the space with expanding foam before sealing up the pin
(and not so pin) holes in the body ledge under my missing windshield, from
the top side, would be a good thing.  Top side gets the good stuff
(fiberglass reinforcement, etc.).  Anyone want to comment on that plan?  The
ledge (top side) is thoroughly sandblasted, and not really too bad.  Despite
all the testimonials, I'm a little leary of that foam.  I don't want to be a
PO someday whose name is mudd (sorry, Doc) for making the next restoration
awful by putting hard to remove plastic foam in a spot like that.  Yes, no?
TIA.
