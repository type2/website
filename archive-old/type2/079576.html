Subject: Replacing mirror glass

Has anyone successfully replaced the glass in the side view mirrors of a bay
window bus? The aftermarket replacement mirrors look like. . . well. . .
aftermarket replacement mirrors. What is trick to removing the glass without
simply smashing it? I'm thinking moving the glass from an aftermarket piece
to the original.
