Subject: Re: [T2] Worst Passes

Too rich.

Of note is that I ALSO did this in a 1967 Austin Healey MK3K...as a 
passenger. In 1967.

Sort of.

I was only a few months old at the time, and my mom and dad were 
driving it back up from N'ahlins where they had picked it up.

I still like the feel of wind in my face...makes me sleep like a baby.

&gt; windscreen. The only thing that got wet was my forehead.
