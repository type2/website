Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 78 bus FS in NewHampshire

Somehow....something here doesn't add up :))

&gt;   Regretably, I have to sell my bus.  I bought it in the spring with all sorts
of good intentions, but winter is coming and I need a better way to haul the
kids once the snow flies.

&lt;snip&gt;


&gt;    I'd consider an interesting motorcycle as part or full trade.


Sounds like you would need a sidecar with that motorcycle......
