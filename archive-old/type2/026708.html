Subject: Used copy of Tom Wilson's book?
Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2000 09:58:11 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Would anyone have a used copy of Tom Wilson's book for sale (rebuilding
aircooled engine)?
I've been waiting about 6 weeks for one to come in on order and meanwhile I
have a half-disassembled engine and need the instructions from Wilson's book
before continuing.
Thanks,
  --Robert
