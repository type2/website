Subject: RE: Clutch for a 1976 bus and Fuel Injection question
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; I need to replace the clutch in my '76 bus.  I called a local clutch shop,
&gt; and his parts book indicates that a 1976 is an 1800 engine.  I thought the
&gt; '76 was a 2000.  Anyway, what are the differences in clutches between the
&gt; two?  Are they interchangable?
&gt;
&gt; As for the F.I.  I am going to replace ALL the fuel lines.  I have
&gt; experience with the cloth covered lines, but not with &quot;american&quot; non-cloth
&gt; covered lines.  The non-cloth line is much cheeper (price) than the other.
&gt; If I go with the non-cloth, what size (ID and OD) do I need to get?  How
&gt; much will it take to do the entire fuel system?


They're wrong.  '76 is 2-liter (and a different clutch diameter from the
'75-back 1.8 liter).  Regarding the fuel line, the cloth line was actually
superceded by a smooth jacketed version.  But be absolutely sure you use the
special high-pressure version, or else your bus may burn.

I sell the complete Sachs clutch kit (disk, pressure plate, throwout
bearing) for $119.95, and genuine German fuel line for $5.95/meter.
