Subject: Re: [T2] compression tester

I bought mine at advance auto parts.  There were two options, either would
have worked.  It comes with several thread options.  I think that I paid $20
or so.  

&gt; If I were to buy a compression tester on Ebay,  Is there a specific size (as
&gt; in thread size metric Vs standard) that I should keep my eye out for, or is
&gt; there a pretty much standard thread size?
