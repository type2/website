Subject: to ear or not? 

I've checked and rechecked everything ad nauseum and cannot find the trouble
here. No matter what I do, my 2.0 litre 77 bus will NOT run when timed
correctly.  I have verified my timing mark using three methods.  The bus
runs well with an occasional miss if timed about 28 before tdc. As I
approach the spec of 7.5 btdc, even adjusting the idle screw will not keep
it from dying.
1.  What could cause this condition on a 15000 mile eng with new bosch
you-name-it's(everything)?
2. Why would the bus run so well at 28 btdc? And would it be terrible to run
as such since it only runs decent there?  I have never run hot and don't
want to now.
3. I have spent WAY too much time on this.  If anyone knows a really sharp
type4 mechanic within a state's distance from Indiana,  I'd love to hear
about him.  I haven't had my bus in a shop for years.
Jay in Indiana
where few volksies, fewer mechanics still wrenchin', and probably zero who
really know the type4 = PROBLEMo
