&gt; Ok those who know more than me, I am attempting to replace the rear wheel
&gt; cylinder on a 71.  All brake related hardware is off.
&gt; There is a 13mm bolt securing the cylinder to the backing plate.
&gt; Bentley says work from behind the plate, there is no bolt behind.

I think that the bolt is on the hub side of the plate, below the cylinder.
You might have to scrape off some grunge to find it.

My hub had a little &quot;divot&quot; taken out of it just for this purpose.  Just
turn the hub until the &quot;divot&quot; lines up with the bolt, then use a socket
and extension to remove it.

Be sure to hit it several times with penetrating oil (both the head and
the hole on the opposite side of the backing plate) before you go to work
with the wrench.  You don't want to break this one off!
