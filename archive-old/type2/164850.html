Subject: RE: [T2] Blowing Oil Filter Seals

You all have pushed me into further research and bar-none, Purolator and Wix
(Napa) are indeed the very best.

I found an excellent site everyone thinking of a filter should read
exhaustively. http://minimopar.knizefamily_dot_net/oilfilters.html

So tomorrow I am going to go searching for a genuine Wix 51515R, Napa Gold
51515R , and a Purolator L39001 and have my own little showdown. I'll never
buy a Fram ever again. And I'm going to pick up one of each for my Mini and
my Jeep.

I can't wait to see if this will fix my wagon once and for all. Now I have
to figure out why my oil temps are so high (210F today) and my head temps
are so low (250F).
