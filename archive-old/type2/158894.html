Subject: Re: [T2] Oregon Insurance

Is it a camper?(ie, motor home)- We got our insurance through Good Sam, 
actually GMAC or  National General.  It is a motor home if it has 
storage, a bed, food preparation area, and at least a porta-potty. All 
other cars are covered also. We insure a 78 camper.  As a pleasure use 
vehicle in the worst state  to insure cars (NJ) we pay about $235 for 6 
months on the camper- that's
for liability, uninsured motorist and comprehensive.  The latter would 
cover running into a deer which is common here. Note you can drop
the camper liability for the 6 months it gets little use ((mid-0ct to
mid April)-they have a one month minimum insurance requirement and to 
prevent it from being reported to the state as dropped, keep it on the 
books with a minimum coverage  like &quot;personal
effects&quot;.
