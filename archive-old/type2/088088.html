Subject: leaky valve covers

I too, have been using the 3M weatherstrip adhesive on the cover side of =
the gasket only.  On the head side I use the blue Permatex gasket =
sealer.  Apply a very thin coat to the gasket and make sure that there =
are no surface irregularities on the head, that is make sure it is =
smooth.  The 3M weatherstrip adhesive serves another purpose and that is =
to make sure that the gasket does not get &quot;sucked in&quot; and cause you to =
lose all you oil.  I got this tip from a friend who has raced formula =
Vees for years.  Modified engines and high RPM can cause a significant =
vacuum to form under the valve cover and cause the gasket to get sucked =
in.  Some people have even brazed or welded small tab on the inside of =
the valve cover to keep the gaskets in place.  The blue Permatex is =
easily removed just by rubbing your fingers over it.  This method also =
lets you reuse the gaskets when you adjust the valves.  Rememer, only a =
very thin coat is all that is needed.  I also use stock covers and bails =
which work better than the aftermarket ones.
