Subject: Score! &lt;68' Westy interior up for grabs...

Score!

Alright folks, here's the deal. I was hanging out with my car enthusiast
landlord this afternoon - his tastes run to '35-'40 Fords and Buicks -
and he mentioned that a former tenant had left some parts from his
splitty in one of the stairwells of our wierd old building... I live in
an old perfume factory in Brooklyn.

Anyways, he wanted to clear the stuff out, and wanted to know if I
needed anything. What was in the stairwell?

An entire Westy interior!!!

Splitty (pre '68) - cabinets, jump seat, rear seat, closet, icebox,
floor, rear headliner-shelf thing, the piece of trim with the fake
curtains that goes behind the cabinets - basically everything but the
cushions and upholstery.

So...

Anyone want it? It's in pretty good shape, actually. If you want to come
get it, or pay the shipping, I'd be satisfied. If you want to trade
something (not that I need anything - my '71 Westy with crumpled
*bumpers*, an *engine* on its second-to-last legs and its torn pop-top-
*canvas* doesn't need anything, nor does my wreck of a '64 Bug (actually
it needs an entire *body* including all four *fenders*)... HINT HINT)
I'd be super happy... In any case I don't want it to go to waste. If you
want it, drop me a note - there has to be a splitty out there who
secretly wants to be a camper...

The lucky guy in Bed-Stuy,

Anton
