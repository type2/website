Subject: Re: Cupholdervs. ashtray

Inertia. Tradition.  Ennui. In a generation or two, when everyone is wearing 
Cola patches, and inhaling &quot;tofu and sprouts mist&quot;, they'll wonder why all 
the cars still have cupholders. And why we were all so foolish as to actually 
pour cold liquids down our throats. Or drive old boxes from Germany.  I keep 
business cards and ketchup packs in my ashtray. I don't know why.
