 &gt; I don't think that VW put any inline filters in buses, at least not
 &gt; until fuel injection.  I think that the filter you are referring to is
 &gt; an add-on.  Someone will correct me if I'm wrong!

 I do not believe that VW put any filter between the tank and carb except 
for the one in the fuel pump.  Notice I said carb because VW did put an in-
line filter on the Fuel injected busses.  I, too, have a filter between the 
tank and the pump.  I put it there to collect any rust that gets stirred 
up.  It holds a lot more than the in-pump filter.
