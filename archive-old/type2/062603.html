Subject: Dip stick test

On a 1600 engine the dipstick is a good rough indicator.  If it is cool and can
be handled comfortably, then there is no worry.. But if the stick is hot to the
touch...too hot to handle comfortably...then you have to find out why.  You have
a problem if you dipstick is hot.  

On the type IV, the dipstick is so far from the engine case and in an open air
space., I really doubt that it would give any kind of clue as to the state of
engine heat.  My two cents...John Jensen in Annapolis
