Subject: RE: [T2] Soft Brakes?

Thanks for all the wrote back on this.  Just a little more info I obtained:

The rear wheel cylinders that were leaking were new and only leaked when
they were pushed in really far -- As I tried to get the calibers (springs)
on the pads.  I have learned that this is normal, the cylinders are wider
towards the inside then the outside, and when the seal is pressed so far in
that it reachs the wide part it leaks.  However, this doesn't mean the
clyinders is bad since this never happens in normal operation.  So, moral of
the story is: if you compress you wheel cylinders past the operation point
they will leak -- however this doesn't mean that you have to replace them.

Secondly, when I replaced the front pads for the rotors then where paper
thin, and my brother and I just took the bus to Baja where we went down the
&quot;hill of hell&quot;, per the sign on the side of the road.  There was no
gardrail, and my wrecked cars in the ravine along with toppled loads, and
truck camper tops.  The rears hadn't been adjusted in a while and the tops
where thin where the bottom where thick -- glad I am taking the time to get
it right.

The pros are right - the rear brakes need to be adjusted to prevent the
condition you describe.  It took me many years of bus-driving (pre
type2-list) to figure this out.  My rear brakes seem to need tightening
every few months to prevent the soft pedal syndrome, and it's a real
annoyance.  One day I'm going to figure out how to install auto-adjusting
drums on the rear.

I'm guessing you probably haven't been tightening your rear brakes every few
months.  If not, and if you are missing any of those black plastic plugs in
the shield, your adjusting stars are likely frozen and may require
disassembly and maintenance before you can adjust the brakes and firm up
your pedal.  That has been my experience anyway.
