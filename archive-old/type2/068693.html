Subject: Re: 8 volt battery in 6 volt bus

Thankks for the responses to our last query re: whether
we should still plan to get a spare (8 volt) battery.

OK - it seems the safest (if not the only possible) approach
is not to try to jump a 6 volt car with a 12 volt one. This
is what we'd thought and was why we had planned to buy a spare
battery.  Looks like we'll go that route and buy another
8 volt battery and a 6/12 volt charger which we'll use in
6 volt mode.  

As for the carb  6 volt accessory issues - this is a 1962 Deluxe.
I think gas gauges were included as of 62, we certainly 
have one. I know the 30 PICT 1 is not the original carb.  
I'm not sure we have the original engine either - there are no 
letters preceding the numbers which are 0776257.  This doesn't seem
to correspond to the list of numbers for Type II engines in the
Muir book.  I'd bet it is not original for this bus, but I'm
not sure where it came from.

Regardless - it does have a 30 PICT 1 on it.  I might like
to replace it - so I'd like to be able to get the 6 volt
idle shutoff valve and choke element if they are available.
If not, I may be able to use what is on there now - if the
replacement carb can accept those parts from the 30 PICT 1.

Any information would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Brian and Stephanie
