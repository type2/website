Subject: re: odometer problem

If the speedometer still works, but the odometer doesn't, it's probably the
metal drive gear in the VDO odometer slipping on the metal display shaft.
The gear is a press-fit on the shaft, and every 175K miles or so, it needs
to get a better grip.  The repair involves painstakingly dealing with
numerous tiny, spring-loaded parts, but shouldn't be difficult for anyone
dealing with type2s.  I wonder about its legality, though?

I just did the odometer repair to a '86 VW Golf which I bought from a
colleague, to get it past Maryland state inspection.  Seems you need both a
working speedometer and odometer to pass inspection here.  Another list
member mentioned the archives deals with this, so I won't go into details.

My son and I just dropped the engine out of our '80 Vanagon, in the first
steps of attempting to find the cause of low (24 psi)compression in No. 3.
I suspect a dropped valve seat (intake valve adjustment cannot be loosened
sufficiently to give any play in the valve train for that valve - as I back
off on the adjuster, the valve just keeps coming out).  With Haynes and Muir
in hand, and the type2 list for backup, I'm getting much deeper into an
engine than ever before.
