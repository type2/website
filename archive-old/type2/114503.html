&lt;&lt; What kind of tape do you guys use to seal up the small holes and such?
Should I use the metal muffler tape?

Thanks!

If nowhere else, check out HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) sup-
pliers in your local phone book...They should carry stainless steel tape; 
sorta
like the ultimate duct tape. Just be sure the surface is clean (especially 
from
oil or grease) before applying. I've used the stuff for any number of sealing
jobs and it's really great...Don't confuse it with the cheaper aluminum tape,
tho'... ;-(
