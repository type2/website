Our 78 Westy, with 2-speed wipers, can't keep up with the rain here in
Indiana!   At the risk of overcomplicating the issue, does anyone know
the correct wipe rate (in stroke cycles per minute) at max speed?  

Assuming we will have to replace or repair the motor or linkage, is it
possible to get at it from the top of the dashboard area rather than
underneath?  Our Westy has the A/C system so it would be rather busy
under the dashboard.
