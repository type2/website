Hi,

Flexible brake lines?? Are you talking about the actual brake lines in
front?  They don't appear to be leaking.  There is no brake fluid missing
&gt;from the master cylinder. If your talking about the flexible lines that run
&gt;from the vacuum line, no I haven't replace them.  This why I was asking from
those who might have been there, none that.  If you think these lines maybe
a problem, then I did to find out what type of hose to use.  Who has
recently replaced these hoses and again what type of hose did they use.
Thanks

Bill
