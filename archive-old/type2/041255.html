&gt;
&gt; What would be a good way to tell if the Pilot Bearing is gone on your
&gt; tranny? I have an intermittent problem with my bus that tends to only
happen
&gt; in 1st or reverse.

It is probaly happening in other gears too, but more noise from the engine
and road at higher speeds masks the noise and/or you most likley hold the
clutch in a little bit longer when you are in first and reverse.

When my pilot bearing was going out it would make and intermittant and very
ugly deep grind noise when I would hold the clutch in. I gave me the creeps

&gt;What will happen if this isn't taken
&gt; care of immediatly? I havn't been driving it cause I'm not sure I trust it
&gt; right now until I have a look to identify the problem.

I drove mine quite for couple of months including a trip for St. Paul to the
Black Hills.  I finally started to see physical problems on the way home.
My input shaft had vibrated enough to loosen the transmission seal and cause
a leak.  Other things that might happen is that you could damage your input
shaft or as the pilot bearing continues to break up, you may not be able to
engage or disengage the clutch.

I would take care of it sooner than later, I am not sure of what kind of
major damage you could do -- I was told none, but don't quote me on that. I
would have done it sooner but I was a little discouraged, I had already had
the engine out 2 times that summer

While it sounds like your pilot bearing don't forget to inspect your throw
out.

Good Luck
