Paul Williamson sends:

&gt; A racer friend of mine told me a long time ago, &quot;Gas is for cleanin', alcohol
&gt; is for drinkin', nitromethane is for racin'.&quot;

Here's a scary thought: Nitromethane was originally invented for use as dry
cleaning solvent. And since its ignition point is higher than gasoline's,
it's probably a safer alternative to gasoline if you've still got a death
wish. (What's preventing more people from washing parts in it than already
do, all none of 'em, is that it's really, really expensive.)

It's mineral spirits for me...reasonably cheap and very effective.
