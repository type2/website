&gt; I could not believe this was possible , it sounded &quot;too good to be

&gt; but I do know (John Anderson and I did some work on one of his) that
the
&gt; case is very T1 looking and, yes, it is aluminum!  So I threw it out
there
&gt; for discussion.  One thing I *do* know is that just cutting the water
&gt; jacket off a wasserboxer cylinder set is gonna get you a *very*
&gt; short-lived engine :-)
&gt; 
&gt; What I don't know is:

[several things I don't know about either snipped]
 
&gt; How you would cool it.  
&gt; (as you say, T1 cooling is close to its max at 1600cc's, tho racers 
&gt; *do* bore to 2L!)

My distinction between racers and bus drivers, cooling-wise, is that
racers usually demand maximum power from their engines for periods of
a few seconds (the length of the straight-away) and at high RPM, where
cooling airflow is maximized.

Bus drivers often demand maximum power for periods of several minutes,
not seconds, and usually run at lower RPM (and airflow).

The thermal mass of the engine can handle excessive waste heat output
for a few seconds, but if the excessive heat output continues the
engine will overheat.  Thus, an engine that is sufficiently cooled for
racing applications will overheat in a bus on the first long hill.
