&gt;Bad news.  It's 30 years now.  Actually, they changed the year to 73, and
&gt;the rolling exemption will be 30 years starting in 2004, if they don't
&gt;change it again.

What was it before the fixed year of 1973?

Boy would it be depressing to get to 2008 and have them change the rules again. What is going to ensure the the EGR parts still remain available?  I imagine when they truly run out, proving that is a fact will be exceptionally hard?
