Subject: Re: [T2] Oktoberbus isn't that far away

&gt;Either driving or time wise.  If folks can drive to Arizona to camp, why
&gt;not drive to South Carolina.  That's right, it's that time of year where
&gt;like-minded folks get together and camp during the second weekend of
&gt;October.
&gt;  
&gt;
And if SC is too darn far away, why not come up to Palomar Mountain in 
Southern California for some beautiful camping at nearly one mile 
elevation, near the famous Palomar Observatory! Second weekend of Oktober.

&quot; The Palomar Observatory is world famous. Located on top of Palomar 
Mountain, this 200-inch telescope is open to the public each day. The 
Observatory is closed at night so the astronomers may observe the starry 
night sky. Nestled among the pines, just below the Palomar Observatory, 
are Fry Creek 
&lt;http://www.forestcamping_dot_com/dow/pacficsw/clevcmp.htm#fry%20creek&gt; and 
Observatory 
&lt;http://www.forestcamping_dot_com/dow/pacficsw/clevcmp.htm#observatory&gt; 
campgrounds. While the canopy of pines at Fry Creek campground is too 
thick for stargazing, half the sites at the Observatory are designed to 
allow a clear view of the stars. Several of these sites have level 
cement pads to allow the camper a closer view of the stars through their 
telescope.&quot;

I'll be there at either Observatory campground or Fry Creek campground, 
in Mellow Yellow, our 84 Westy. I'd bring the Wonderbus but it's not set 
up for camping.
