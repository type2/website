Subject: Ambiguous description

Hi Ron,
I checked out the site. The descriptions are straight-forward labels. If I 
type in the wrong word on the search for a part, I could miss what you have 
to sell us. -- I would have typed 'right rear reflector' for that part. 
Anyway, maybe a quick &quot;this goes here and does this on your 19?? model&quot; 
would be helpful for us beginners. Photos are great, too. Photos take a lot 
of time to do, though - maybe your nearby high school students have 
service-learning hours to fulfill : free labor? :-)

Stef
