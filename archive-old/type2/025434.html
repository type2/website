Well, we finally got our new 79 Westy home on Monday.  We paid $200 for it
(Thanks Scott!) and it costs about $150 total to tow it from Spanaway/Graham
to Capital Hill.  We went with U-haul and rented both a truck and car
carrier (all 4 wheels off the ground).  Karen and I pulled it through a
U-Wash and after 40 minutes of spraying, praying and scrubbing, got about 5
years of pasture, trees and neglect off it's exterior.  Lots and lots of
little dings, dents and surface rust, but all in all pretty straight.  Of
course, I now have no money and so the engine rebuild will be slow and,
er... methodical.  

On  the way back North from Tacoma we saw a 69 Westy outside a wrecking yard
on Martin Luther King Jr, just before it connects with I-5.  It's completely
filled with junk and is a bit beat up, but fairly straight in the body.  The
engine is gone and possibly the tranny as well.  I think the wrecker intends
to crush it, and it would be an awful shame.  Anyway, the shady fellas I met
tearing parts out of other cars  right by it seemed to be of the opinion
that if the wrecker left it outside his gates it was fair game as far as
free parts.  I was towing my 79 and so didn't have time to poke and pry.
Anyway, if there's anyone out there who wants a fixable (IMHO) '69 Westy,
drop me a line and I'll tell ya what I know about it.
