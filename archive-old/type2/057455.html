&gt; Agreed.  The type IV engine with no seal will have two places through which

&gt; 3 *inches* away from the fan.  You don't have to be a brain surgeon to
&gt; figure out where the engine fan will be drawing most of it's cooling air

   OTOH, when you are cruising, those &quot;vents&quot; as you call them are
really air scoops, and pack air straight down to the engine, thereby
pressurizing that area. And again, these engines simply do not overheat
at idle. Besides which, heat radiation being what it is, I sincerely
doubt there a heck of lot of difference in the temp above the rear tin
and below it. Some, but not much, not after running awhile, and the tin
gets hot. 

 very dangerous for the motor.  My oil temp runs about 130 degrees over
the
&gt; outside air temperature with a sealed engine compartment.  If my engine

   Mine's about the same -- and I don't have the rear tin in place. 


&gt; were drawing in the hot air from around the exhaust, it would definately
&gt; overheat.  I'll be keeping my engine seal in place.

    Doubt TX is much hotter than Mobile, and my machine was fine all
last summer.
