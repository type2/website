&gt; Well, for my megasquirt, I use the manifold vacuum that comes right off

&gt; the gas, the vacuum holds steady as shown on the computer.


megasquirt is a different type of control fuel injection isn't it???  I
know the VW version on the type 2's is Air Flow Control system, but I
guess taking a &quot;T&quot; offf the presure regulator is probably as good a place
as any

thanks
