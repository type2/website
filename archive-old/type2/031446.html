&gt;  I just don't understand why your mechanic would want to permanantly disable
&gt;  something that can only be of benefit in cooler weather and have no negative
&gt;  effect in warmer climates.

well I have mine disconected but for a different reason.

my heating system was totally shot, so I put a gas heating system in and
totally removed the stock heating system.  thus I have bare header type
pipes, and since there was nothing to hook to no lower deflector tin.  now
this is the piece of tin that directs the air over the thermostat bellows.

I was afraid that the bellows would never get warm enough and not open the
flaps and overheat my engine.

if anyone has different experiences I would love to hear it.

but for now I have temp gauge and and in Cold weather and I do drive when
it gets bitter cold, I'm not sure the engine gets as warm as it should,
sometimes the oil sump gauge doesn't record over 180-190 F
