Subject: RE: Blaupunkt radio polarity

Simple - 12V to the spade in your power picture, ground it anywhere on the
housing.

They stopped the 6/12 +/- thing on most radios sometime in the late 60s
early 70s. Pretty much any pasenger car from that time on is 12v negative
ground.

BTW, the plastic plug covers a connector that was often used for a traffic
announcement decoder. These make great line-in connectors so that you can
hook up an I-pod or something else. The cover bridges two contacts - one
line-out and one line-in.

I know some radios are configurable for 6V/12V and pos/neg ground but  
when I opened up this one I see no such adjustments.
