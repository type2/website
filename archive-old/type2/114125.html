Subject: Re: [T2] driving w/leaky push rod seals?

&gt; &gt;I have a trip that I need to make on tuesday evening (20 miles or so) and
&gt;was
&gt;wondering if there were any problems with driving the westy
&gt;
&gt;Hey Buddy 20 miles is nothing.  I once drove fromo Canada all the way to
&gt;Central America and back with a bus that leaked and smoked oil more than
&gt;anything I've ever seen.
&gt;
&gt;Personally I doubt you'd even use 1/2 a bottle or less in that short
&gt;distance.

Heck i drove from VA to TN missing the bolt that holds the thermostat cable 
pulley on in  a Type IV 2.0.

Used a CASE of oil. It well rust proofed my Hyundai that I was towing...
