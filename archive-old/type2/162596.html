&gt; How did a VW 411/412 gas heater mount?  Would it be adaptable to a bus as a supplemental heater?

it was mounted above the rear axle.

it is a BA-4

I have one in my bus. (78)


it is a booster heater but I use it as a sole heater in my bus and have
completely removed the stock heater.  it uses the old A/C blower to suck
air from under the dash thru the heater and back into the stock duct just
behind the front beam, the heater hangs from the old condensor mounts
under the front pan.
