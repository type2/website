Subject: 79 exhaust with extra hose outlets???

So crawling around under my bus last night I discovered that there are hose
outlets at the front of the heater boxes(front is front) pointing out at
angles. My fan blows fine and air comes out the front of the bus outlets up
front, yet these two hose connections are not hooked up to anything. What is
the diff with 79 heaterboxes? I don't know what these are supposed to hook
up to.??? Are 74 heater boxes compatible, and mufflers?
Thanks,
Courtney
