Hi Volks,

&quot;I don't ask for help too often for The Mothership but this morning my 
clutch cable broke.  I have never had to replace this part and need the 
wisdom of the list in doing so.&quot;

   In over 20 years of driving VW buses I've found that the clutch or 
accelerator cable will usually break at the most inopportune time.  I try to 
prevent that by taking each one out and inspecting it at least once a year.  
I put them back in with plenty of grease, I like to use CV joint grease.  If 
the cable is worn, I replace it with a new one, and the worn one becomes my 
spare.  I compare the newly replaced cable with the one I'm carrying as a 
spare and keep the best of the 2 as my spare.
   This way I get to deal with the cables on my own terms.  You know, on a 
day it's not raining, during daylight hours, in the summer, and best of all 
in my own driveway.
