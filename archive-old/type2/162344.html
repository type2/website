&gt; Good parts from junk yard bays are getting harder to find in the NOVA / MD /

there is what appears to be a 74 bay in a private junkyard (Frankfort
towing) not far from Crazy Rays on Erdman ave. in Baltimore.  I have not
been able to connect with the owner. it is pretty much complete but full
of trash. have no idea engine/tranny it was there last time I looked and
fairly complete have no idea why it is there.

if anyone is really interested I could meet you nearby and take you to it,
it is off the beaten track. it can be seen from North Ave, But not the one
you'll find on a map
