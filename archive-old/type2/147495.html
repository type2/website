Subject: where does this go

So i finally got around to replacing my door panels.  I decided not to 
put my new speakers in them, and choose the new plastic kick panels 
instead.  I'll post pictures soonish.  As I was removing the dirvers 
side kick panel one of the square metal things that attaches to the 
bottom of my fuse box (1978 if it matters) fell out.  I'm not sure where 
to put it back.  It has the number &quot;111 951 307B&quot; on it as well as a 
diagram with an 85 and 86 on it.  What is this and which empty slot does 
it go in?
