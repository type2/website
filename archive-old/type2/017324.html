If the connection to the air flow meter becomes disconnected, you will observe
exactly the problem you've described.  One of the functions of the air flow meter
is to monitor the flow of air going to the engine, and if air stops flowing to the
engine, the voltage to the electric fuel pump is removed.  This prevents the fuel
pump from operating in the event an accident occurs etc. However when first
starting the engine, the electric fuel pump is allowed to operate (for several
seconds) in order to prime the FI system and thus allow the engine to start.
After this short delay, the ECU looks for the proper signal from the air flow
meter.  If the cable is disconnected, the fuel pump stops and shortly thereafter
does the engine!  The FI system is really quite an improvement from the carb.
system.  The archives covers the operation and troubleshooting of the FI system
fairly well.---------------------------------------------------------------------
