Subject: [T2] Unca Joel

&gt; BTW what ever happened to Unca Joel... could somebody send me the short poem
&gt; of his that ended in ..... &quot;Four wheels beneath a cargo bay.?&quot;

It might be in the Library under Unca Joel's Follies, or Collected Works
or something. Anyone who hasn't seen 'em should go check 'em out.
