&gt;I have a 1973 Bus manufactured in 9/73. (VIN 2232252794) I am having some 
&gt;time with the brain carb (Solex 32-34PDSIT-2).  I found a replacement for 
&gt;it, brand spanking new and in the box still, and for only 50 bucks!  Boy 
&gt;was I happy. Until I opened the box...  Yes it does have Solex 32-34 
&gt;PDSIT-2 on the side of it, however, it is the same, yet it is different. 
&gt;It does not have the Electro magnetic cutoff value ( central idling 
&gt;system), Idle mixture enrichment, Central Idle system mixture screw, or 
&gt;Idle speed adjusting screw (central idle system). It does not have the two 
&gt;idling system and air cleaner tubes on the top part of the body near these 
&gt;other part either.  But then... Bessie-Lou does not have her Electro 
&gt;magnetic cutoff value ( central idling system) or Electro magnetic cut off 
&gt;value , idling system hooking up either.  (looks like the Solex 
&gt;32-34PDSIT-3, but backwards...) There are no wires there for them period...

Velly intellesting...  it appears you do have a version of the carb without 
the central idling system.  For a guy who has only had his bus a month, you 
sure know your terminology.

&gt;I am wondering things.. I was told I could just replace this one with the 
&gt;old even though they are different... however then there is no hook up for 
&gt;the idling system or air cleaner hoses.

My guess is that yes, you could do this.  You would adjust the idle the 
traditional way, by turning the throttle stop set screws.

&gt;Can I take the top section off my old carb and put it onto the new one?

Er, uhhh... :)  Not sure without the parts in front of me, but my memory 
tells me that all of the central-idling-specific parts are in the top of 
the carb, so it just might work.

&gt;Do you have any suggestions other that buying a  new carb kit? and if it 
&gt;is new carbs... which ones?

My suggestion is to try the carb.  Plug the holes that are not attached to 
anything.  You will still need a crosspipe between the carbs so just plug 
the upper section of your current crosspipe (the part that used to go to 
the central idling system on the left carb).

Which carbs if you decide to replace?  No easy answer.  What is most 
important to you - 
Reliability?   Serviceability?  Performance?  Economy?  If you could state 
your priorities in these areas, you might get more helpful suggestions.
