Subject: Another Starting Problem

Hello All,
I have a 1979 FI bus who has been plagued with starting problems this year.  
Earlier in the summer I wrote here about its woes concerning an inability to 
turn over and what seemed to be a power-delivery problem; that ended up 
being an un-obvious case of bad/corroded battery cables.  Now, with that all 
fixed and the battery strong and everything turning over nicely, now the 
engine just won't start.  It cranks well and fast enough, but will not fire. 
  I actually noticed this symptom while the previous problem was going on, 
replaced the coil, and it immediately went away; now, however, it appears to 
be back in force and it even stranded me on Friday.  What I've noticed is 
this:  (1) Twice recently I've started it no problem on a particular day, 
drove it, shut her off, and then when trying to start it again later that 
same day, it has failed to start as described above -- then, when making 
another attempt to start it the next day, it has fired right up; (2) during 
the process of attempting to start it, the sound of the cranking is pretty 
even -- that is, no sputtering or coughing; and (3) now it won't start at 
all, even on the day after.  It now seems like it is something that is 
getting worse.  I have no idea where to start here.  It's probably been a 
few years -- but not very many miles (maybe a few thousand)  -- since she's 
had a tune-up.  I tried switching in a new rotor while I waited for AAA the 
other day, but that had no effct.  I was hoping a few savvy experts out 
there could give me some likelihoods and ideas as to where to start in 
searching for this little gremlin.  If you need more information or 
symptoms, please let me know.  Thanks for your help!
