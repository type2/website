Mike:
If you have good compression, there is nothing to be gained by a rebuild.
You say it has a hard spot. Does it also have this hard spot with the spark plugs out? Like when you are checking the compression?
I think your timing is set wrong, like 20-30 degrees too advanced. when it does fire, it is trying to back the engine up!
If  you could get a Muir book, try to set the timing by the static method to get it started. Then use a timing light to set it while it's running.

&gt; Here it is.  I've been trying, patiently to get my 78 2.0L F.I. running.  Ive checked the FI, and I've got feul(this probably sounds fimilar, I checked the spark and I have spark, replaced the coil and a number of things including the combi relay.  I've determined that I have a hard spot in the motor.  I did a compression test, they were all good.  But the motor does have a hard spot, the starter slows to almost a stop.  I removed my valve cover and discovered that they are dry, NO OIL... What could be wrong???  Should I remove the engine and do a rebuild??  This would be my first rebuild, is it do-able for a first timer??  Please help..Thanks Mike
