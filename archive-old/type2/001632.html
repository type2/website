Hey David...

I'm a bit confused...  For a dual advance carb (which I have), the front
vacuum port connects to the side of the carb.  The rear port on the dizzy is
the one I'm a bit confused about...

In the manual, there was some mention that the vacuum port on the rear of
the carb was involved with some pollution control device...  Since my bus
doesn't have this device, then should I block that port and have the vacuum
line from the rear of the dizzy run to the intake manifold?

And if the line doesn't run to the intake manifold, why is that vacuum port
on the manifold there at all?

Hmmm..

Tom

&gt; Quick question..
&gt;
&gt; Should the vacuum hose that connects to the front of the vacuum advance on
&gt; the dizzy be connected to the vacuum port on the intake manifold (left) or
&gt; the vacuum port on the front of the carb (34pict 3).  The bus is a 71,
1600
&gt; dp.

Dual vacuum distributor, right?

The small outlet on the dist connects to the port on the SIDE of the carb,
drivers side.

The larger one connects to an equivilent sized port on the REAR (FIF!) of
the carb.

The ports are made to allow the correct vacuum conditions, when they are
needed...The intake port just gives full available vacuum at all times.

Good luck.
