Subject: Re: [T2] Change those *&amp;%*&amp;$ fuel lines!

I was just over there looking for the same thing.  Seems like theres
only a kit for FI models.
Anyone know if theres a complete kit for carb models?  I'm sure I
could just buy the hose/clamps/filters/etc and do it myself if I have
to..

&gt; already cut to fit for specific years as each is slightly different.
