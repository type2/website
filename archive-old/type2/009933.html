Subject: Re: Timing notch on '73 1700

&gt;  I went to find the timing notch on the pulley wheel and
&gt;had no luck.... no tiny notch, no paint spot, nothing...I carefully cleaned
&gt;the wheel, used my fingernail to feel for any kind of notch on the front of
&gt;the wheel (FIF) ...zip.... I can find approximate TDC by lining up the 
&gt;rotor
&gt;with the notch on the dizzy, and feeling the slack in the pully 
&gt;wheel...there
&gt;is a scratch on the rear of the pully wheel (FIF) that I am wistfully
&gt;thinking lines up with the 10 degree mark on the timing scale....but that
&gt;seems reaching for straws.
&gt;



To find TDC : remove either valve cover. If you remove the left one watch #3 
valves. If you remove the right one watch #1 valves. Turn the engine in 
direction of rotation. After no valve movement, the first valve to move will 
be the exhaust. Watch it open and close. STOP just when the exhaust valve 
closes and the intake just starts to move. If you go too far the intake will 
open too much. Just go around again and stop when the exhaust is just closed 
and the intake is just starting to move. At this point your piston is at 
TDC. Look on the inside edge of the pulley  (towards the front of the bus at 
about 11 0'clock ) for a tiny V mark. It should be at zero.
