Subject: Finally found the &quot;F&quot; in FLAPS

Hi folks,

This past weekend I finally found a FLAPS I enjoy doing business with (this
is a major achievement!!).  The local Autopalace, Acme etc. places in my
experience mostly have knotheads working them who aren't courteous and
usually don't know a dang about what I need.  Unfortunately I've been unable
to buy everything mail order so I occasionally end up dealing with some
incompetent jughead at one of the various local places (do I sound bitter?).

I tried yet another shop in the yellow pages that's about a 10-15 minute
drive from me and I think I hit the jackpot.  Prices are reasonable and the
salespeople seem knowledgeable and courteous.  Ed, the counterman who helped
me this weekend, previously owned a '71 bus and still remembered quite a lot
about the modifications he made (progressive carb, ported heads, extractor)
so we were able to chew the fat between incoming calls.  Unfortunately Ed's
bus met its end with a fuel line engine fire.  He said when the fire ended,
you couldn't tell that it had been a bus it was burned so severely.

So now he drives a Toyota van, though it seems he misses the '71 just a
little bit.  I think if I ever get the Kadrons set up on my engine I'll
challenge his Toyota to a race.

The other salespeople also were genial to their customers and appeared to be
experienced in the autoparts biz (I must be in FLAPS heaven).

So if you're in the Hartford, CT area check out Foreign Autopart in East
Hartford (860) 289-9009.
