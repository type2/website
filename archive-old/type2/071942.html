&gt;&gt;be a fair price to sell it?
&gt;..Hmmm, you don't say much about WHY it breaks down, pretty hard to sell.
&gt;Depending on where
&gt;&gt;you are, give ME $500 and I'll take it off your hands....

&gt;Hate to throw a wet blanket on your trying to sell the van!!   but
&gt;have to agree with John....there aren't a lot of pluses going
&gt;for this sale!....Good parts vehicle??

Didn't we just get done deciding that 1978 was the best year ever?  And in
the past I've heard that the auto tranny in that bus is a good design.  If
the camper is in decent shape and runs at all, it should be worth at least
$1,000 to someone.
