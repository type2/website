&gt; &gt; From: Darwin7217_at_aol_dot_com
&gt; &gt; A friend brought me his '71 bus to look at.  I'm more familiar with type
&gt; 4
&gt; &gt; engines so I think I need some help.  
&gt; &gt; Upon acceleration, not consistently but about 50% of the time, there is
&gt; &gt; terrible hesitation to the point that the bus wants to die.  Stepping on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; clutch will bring it back to life.  It sputters through first gear and
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; initial acceleration in second.  
&gt; &gt; Also, during deceleration, the engine has a tendency to stall.  
&gt; &gt; Rotor, points, condensor and dist. cap all are brand new.  Timing was
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; adjusted this week.  Stock solex carb.
&gt; &gt; Can anyone help advise me where to begin?  Is the problem most likely in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; carburetor or is there a chance the fuel pump may be involved?  I'm new
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; this type 1 engine.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
I had exactly this problem in my dual port 73, it which came &amp; went,
 but more often came.......... 

after lots of this &amp; that with all the normal things mechanical &amp; electrical

(infact in the mean time I had totally re-built the engine, reground crank,
new pistons
 &amp; sleeves, new cam, new heads &amp; valves etc..... new coil, overhauled the
carb.. 
I decided to pull the dizzy out &amp; give it a thorough overhaul (yep that was
untouched 
&amp; original!!)

once it was apart, I confirmed that it all worked correctly, but I noticed
that the vertical
play in the shaft was around 1.5mm &amp; the lobes on the cam were visibly worn,
so 
much so that when I pushed the shaft up, the points gap would open to about
1.4mm!! 
and when I pushed it back down (to the wear marks on the lobes) it was down
to 0.3mm!!
..... so if the shaft is moving vertically during use, you have a lovely
variable points gap 
- not good!!!!

Ringing around I have been unable to get spare parts for the original dizzy,
so since I 
had my dads 009 in the garage (he didn't like it on his 69 single port) I
set that up with 
new points &amp; condenser &amp; now my bus runs sweeter than ever!!!!

in-fact it is so sweet, smooth &amp; powerful through the rev range, I wonder if
the 009 is 
only suited to certain set-ups (e.g.. 34 pict 3 dual port) and maybe the bad
stories are 
when used in combination with other - anyone out there looked into this?

so check that dizzy for wear!
