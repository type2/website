&gt; Bumpers are supposed to reduce impact to the body of a vehicle. The

Double Whammy!  The fragile rear mount spare is what undecided us from a
CRV in favor of a Scion when my wife's new car jones needed fixing.

The main impact structure of a bus extends forward from the chassis.  The
upper sheet metal is there only to support the windshield and dash.
Adding a spare to the front puts a very rigid piece of metal in front of a
very weak piece of metal.  The design of a bus is such that the driver is
above most collisions with conventional vehicles of the bus's original
design era and locale.  These days, with huge SUVs everywhere that doesn't
follow.  However, all a spare on the front does is provide a means of
pushing the nose in further in places where it really cannot avoid hitting
the occupants.  It doesn't really make much difference in severe
collisions.

In low speed collisions the spare does make a big difference.  The spare
takes a low speed collision that might have moved the bumper pack a bit
on its bolts and turns it into major sheet metal damage.  Also, the
appearance of a nice soft rubber tire on the front of the bus might
just encourage the &quot;park by Braille&quot; set.

My bus came with a front spare mount thrown in, as the PO didn't have time
to install it.  Thank goodness for that!
