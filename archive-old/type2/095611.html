Subject: New Bus Depot accessory?  :-) 

A friend of mine, who happens to be a brewmaster at an upstate New York
microbrewery, recently purchased a Vanagon Westy for $250.  (It's far from
pretty, but so far he's driven it to New Orleans and back, and all around
New York State, without anything else invested other than a fuel pump!)

One of his first upgrades was to modify the water inlet on the side of the
camper, to something befitting his occupation.  It is now an outlet instead
of an inlet (with an actual tap handle planned for the future) ...

It sure came in handy at the last music festival we went to.  In fact,  I
think every Westy should have come with one!  :-)
