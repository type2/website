Subject: so I need a new engine
Message-ID: &lt;378B69DB.66B5DB53_at_uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Well after a long search my wife and I finally found a bus.  We are now
the proud owners of a '78 bus.  The westy interior is fantastic, the
body needs to be restored (if you know of a good body place in IL or
have any suggestions on where to start I would appriciate it), and we
just found out we need a new engine.  We had the bus checked out before
we bought it and knew we had to do some minor repairs ourselvs.  Well
fifty miles into the 143 mile dirve the little red oil can lit up.  I
pulled over immedatly and than watched all the oil drip out of the
engine.  Thanks to AAA we had her towed all the way home to a VW/Porche
mechanic that has been in town since the mid seventies.  I just got the
call that I need a new motor.  The whole shabang is gonna cost us $2400
with a 12mo/12K mile warrenty.  Ouch!  On to the question....  Is this
too much.  If so what do I do.  These guys are the only people down here
that have any experience with Type 2's.  Infact people come from all
over central Illinois to have these guys work on their bugs, busses
ect...  Eventhough I can do some minor repairs, my wife and I are no
where near ready to start to tackle a job like this, nor do we have the
time.   Any comments or suggestions.
Thanks
Sean and Michelle
