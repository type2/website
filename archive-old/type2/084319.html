Subject: Re: [T2] Always check your rear view mirror

Willis,
I hope this make you feel better... I just recently put a rebuilt in my 
78 Westy. I drove it from CT to NC for Everybus02. It ran great
all the way down with only one minor problem with my wipers. I got home 
late on the following Monday. On Tuesday I took the bus
for a ride to warm it up for a oil change. My wife also left at the same 
time in her mini van to visit her parents. I was right down the road
from my house at a stoplight. I took my foot off the brake and reved the 
motor to smooth out the idle. That's when my wife thought I
was going an hit me in the rear. She smashed my rear bumper in and the 
panel just below the engine hatch. Some how she just missed
the engine hatch. Regardless, I have to put on a new bumper and replace 
the panel below the hatch. I also need to repair the front of
out 99 mini van also. Thanks honey, I love you too!!!!!!!
