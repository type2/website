Subject: Re: [TB] Re: Oil cooler lines

 Did you use a stock oil cooler or go to the tube type?

In reply: If I cheesed on my engine rebuild in any way, it is something
way out of my control.
You can just bet that I'm going to install the cooler.
I'd like to have someone come to me with a definitive answer to both
lowering the oil pressure and lowering the oil temperature at highway
speeds.
Tomorrow AM I'm going to swap out the oil bypass spring and plunger with
the same parts from the spare engine in my garage. The trip across town
to get the hoses made (high temp 1/2&quot; with crimp on Imperial Eastman
Hydraulic fittings) I'll be running the engine long enough to reach the
full temperatures and thin out the engine oil and get the bypass valve to
exercise a few times. I seriously doubt that either the plunger or
plunger bore could have enough wear to impair the operation of the valve
but  it is something I can do quickly when the engine is cool.
I'd rather not *just throw money* at the problem but so far it seems to
be a fix even if it is not truly corrective of the existing problem. I'll
be satisfied with a 20 degree drop in engine oil temperature and as far
as the pressure goes I think that will resolve itself with normal engine
wear.

I want to thank everyone for their lengthy, diligent and thought
provoking responses to my original post. (My original post was actually
July 5th 2001 and titled How Much is Too Much) It addressed the same
problems but did not touch on the application of an oil cooler.
