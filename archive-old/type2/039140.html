Subject: Update on those stripped screws...

You may remember.....

&gt;I was trying to remove the doors on my '72 Westy. I got 6 out of 8 of the 
hex 
&gt;head screws loose after soaking in penetrating oil for a few days, but I 
&gt;stripped out the head of the top screw on both sides.... What do 
&gt;I do? Am I SOOL? 

Thanks to everybody for responding. The first stripped screw came loose after 
a brief meditation with some hops and barley. The second one I had to drill 
out (about a week later when I got back to it). A 1/4&quot; drill bit did the 
trick just fine. Once the drill was past the head, it the head separated from 
the screw body and the drill actually threaded the rest of the screw right 
through. No damage was done to the female threads and I have about 8 spares 
in my other bus so it looks like I'm set.

Thanks again!
