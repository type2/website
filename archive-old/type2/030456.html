Subject: sliding door maintainance (long)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9910051217030.18755-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Because a couple of people have asked...

Mostly maintainance is cleaning and greasing.  There are three &quot;points of
motion&quot;, two are fairly simple, one a bit complex.

The upper and lower rollers do need to be present (seems obvious, but you
would be suprised at how often they are missing) and do need to be
greased.  I find the white lithium grease (sold in tubes or spray cans) is
ideal.  In the spray can it, like WD-40, can be poked into places that
would otherwise require disassembly.  It is made for use on boat trailers,
so it is water-proof.  The tracks at the top and bottom of the door...
the top track rarely needs more than a wipe and grease, the bottom track..
now that's an different story...  needs to be cleaned, needs to be
greased, and then needs to be looked at with an eye toward straightness.
If there are significan humps or dips in the track, you are gonna have
trouble.   Why are there dips and humps?  because you need new rockers!
and a new track!  As the rocker rusts off, the track begins to rust
itself, and to sag from the lack of support.  I can offer little here but
get the rockers replaced  :-(

All of which is a lead up to the usual suspect in badly behaved sliding
doors... the rear support (RS from here on out :) and track.  As with the
upper track, there is rarely anything wrong with the track, it just needs
a wipe and grease. That RS is a complex little puppy under great strain,
tho, and ought to come out and be inspected.  You *don't* need to remove
the sliding door to get the RS off!  First, get inside the bus and close
the slider.  there will be two M6 bolts at the rear of the door that
attach the support to the door.  If you are lucky, they are covered by
black plastic caps.  Remove the caps and the bolts.  Open the door.  Get a
milk crate and a couple boards, open the door just enough to get it popped
out at the back to the maximum (only and inch or two).  Look inside the
support and you will see two more bolts inside the rear edge of the door.
Remove them.  Support the rear edge of the door on the milk crate and
boards, lift it slightly, and pull the RS to the rear.  It will come out.  
May require some wiggle, but it will come out.  Slide that assembly to the
rear of the bus until you reach the cutout in the track and pass the
slider block thru the hole in the track [1]

Now that you have the RS assembly in your hands and loose of the bus, sit
down and take a &quot;70's moment&quot; :-)  Sit and grok, in other words.  there is
a slider block, plastic and usually worn out, a wheel, sometimes in one
piece with really nice ball bearings, but usually without and wobbling
free, and the U with it's support bearings and the two catches, neatly
housed in a (usually) broken pot metal casting.

And you wondered why it didn't work right :-( These RS's used to be common
as dirt and you could get them from any junk yard for $5, but they are
getting rarer and rarer, especially in decent condition.  When you are in
a junk yard and see one in decent condition, I advide collecting it!  I
*think* you can get replacement wheels and rubbing blocks (Ron?), but the
casting and bearings for the U are NLA, so be careful!  The secret is
simply to disassemble, clean, grease, and reassemble, keeping track of the
little parts and pieces.

Once the RS is ready for reinstallation, pop it onto the track, and back
into its cove in the door, then insert the bolts loosely from the outside,
rear, and then, entering thru the front doors, to the inside front.  At
this point, you want to tighten the rear pair to &quot;snug&quot; but with
possiblity of movement and adjust the rear of the door so that it is
centered up and down.  If the door is too high, it won't close, if it is
too low, it won't open.  Once it is centered, crank the front bolts from
the inside and tighten the rear bolts from the outside.

As I think of it, this looks like a perfect candidate for some
illustrations :-)  and I have this new Digital Camera burning a hole in my
pocket :-)  ....  Stand by, there may be pix tonight!

[1]  removing the RS from under the cover...  Usually, I have no
broblem tugging the cover out enough to remove the RS without removing the
cover, *but* if it looks liek it might kink the cover, or if you are just
not comfortable, or...  To remove the cover, remove the screws at the
front and rear lower corners (underneath), get a 6&quot; stiff putty knife and
hammer, and put the putty knife blade up in the top (*OUTSIDE* the clamp,
eh???) and bang the cover up by banging on the handle of the putty knife.
Move the putty knife forward and backward, spread the load!  when it comes
time to reinstall, use a 2x4 to bang it down, never bang directly on the
cover, it will bend very easily!
