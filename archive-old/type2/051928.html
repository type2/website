Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info

&gt;I have an early bay so I might be blowing smoke, but is it possible to
&gt;use a hoist from above through the hatch to lower the engine onto a sheet
&gt;of plywood or cardboard?

I seem to remember quite a while back someone posting about this, saying
they used a couple of milk crates or something and a beam with a hoist
attached.  It can definitely be done.  Anyone care to check the archives?
