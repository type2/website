&gt;Circuit 12? Track 12 on the diagrams? Fuse 12?
&gt;I'll assume fuse 12.

You are correct.  It is fuse 12.  I couldn't think of anyway better to
describe it.

&gt;My #1 pick, though, is that fuse 12 is a 16 amp
&gt;circuit and requires a 16 amp red fuse

It is a 16 amp fuse.  Heck, I even tried a 25 amp fuse just to see what
would happen.  The fuse blows almost immediately.

Let me give a bit more detail...
The entire wiring harness looks like it has been cut and respliced
directly below where the harness comes out of the cab and then back
through and under the frame.

Everyone is absolutely correct...almost everything goes through this
circuit.  My brake lights and running lights still work.  High beams and
such also work.  Generator light, turn signals, flasher, horn, do not
work.  Battery won't keep a charge (I assume this is also dependant on
this circuit.).

I'm not afraid of work, but if I am going to have to check almost every
connection it might be as easy to just replace the harness (if there is
a good stock type harness available).

Suggestions...recommendations...

Thank you all,

Michael Martin
