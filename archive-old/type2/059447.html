&gt;  I remember a while back at a previous Vanfest in the UK (I think 3 years
ago)
&gt;  that
&gt;  there was a board with an announcement saying VAG-UK now deem it okay to 
&gt; remove
&gt;  these bulkheads.
&gt;  
&gt;  BUT I'd not do it, partly because its a good rule to follow that if you 
&gt; remove
&gt;  strength you should add it back (and that would be a PITA here) and also 
&gt; because
&gt;  you don't need to, unless you're installing a shower into a camper (if you 
&gt; don't
&gt;  understand that anyone, pmail me and I'll explain!!) Or do you wish to 
&gt; install
&gt;  swivelling cab seats, like wot are so popular in Vanagons?

&gt;  Can the pedestals (bulkheads?) behind the front seats of a '74 bus be 
&gt; removed to
&gt;  facilitate installation of alternative seating? Will this impair the 
&gt; structural
&gt;  integrity of the vehicle?
&gt;  

What Pual remembers is more or less correct, and he is right to say that if
some strength/ridgitity is removed then something should be put back.

In this case you should do as VW did on the late T2 deluxe micro busses and
add a 
substansial L shaped bracket into the corner between the door pillar and the
seat pedestal.

Good luck
Bob
