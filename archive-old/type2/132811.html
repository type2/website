Subject: Re: [T2] scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

Already talked to the scrapper. Dealing directly with the
recycling/crushing yard. Called several junkyards and got quotes of $50 -
$150 for them to haul it off -- flatbed (no wheels) or standard tow (we
leave the wheels) didn't seem to matter.

Every one of them said that around here about the only way to get rid of a
stripped vehicle is to get it to the (only) nearby scrapyard. I have a
towbar and the vehicle is still registered so it can be towed 4 wheels
down. 

Underside is rusted to worthlesness so the beam and everything else is
staying. Original curb weight was, what -- about 3500 - 3800 lbs? Knock off
about 450 for engine/tranny and another 1000 or so for interior and glass
and there's still enough weight for 3.5 cents/lb to cover the the 30 mile
tow.

&gt; If you walk away with $20 bucks you will be lucky.  Easier to call
&gt; someone that hauls off cars for free for their scrap value (kidney
&gt; foundation) or just in the phone book, or call a tow company. Or, call
&gt; the junk yard and ask for the name of someone.  I bet you anything the
&gt; scale man can pass your name an number on to someone who comes in
&gt; regularly who will haul it off for you.
