Subject: NOS Windshield Rubber?

NOSers:

I have been comparison shopping for replacement windshield rubber
for old buses.  Already bought from BusBoys, Rocky Mountain Motor
Works, Vintage VW Parts and West Coast Metric.  Looking at the
materials and knowing that VW originally had separate numbers for
left and right windshield rubber, I am looking for input from
anybody who has access to (or remembrance of) NOS OEM windshield
rubber.

Specifically, was original replacement rubber moulded at the
corners to accommodate the shape of the glass and could you, by
eyeball, tell the left from the right?
