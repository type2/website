It may seem like you adjusted it perfectly but the dwell meter doesn't lie
unless it's broken or set to the wrong position.  The mere act of tightening
the screw can change the gap and you have to try several feeler gauges to
discover this.

Were the points new? If they were old were the contacts checked to see if
they needed filing?  This will fool a feeler gauge every time.

&gt; my about 15.  Do I readjust?  The points were adjusted super good, honest.

How is it running?  It may be seem to run ok at idle but as RPMS increase a
low dwell value will result in incomplete combustion. A dwell this low means
that the gap is too wide and the spark duration will not be as sustained as
it could be.
