Subject: Re: Help. FI AC type2 1979 VW Bus Leaking Oil after service!

&gt; What did they say they were going to fix for $125?  I
&gt; just changed my oil (80 Westie) and had a serious leak

The work order we obtained clearly states &quot;replace front seal&quot; and that is all
parts and labour come to $125. i'm pretty sure that they are in the wrong here..
they are supposed to be VW specialists... overfilling my oil is a pretty dumb
mistake. It doesnt look like the oil is coming from the 'oil change' area ..
it's coming out near the fan and the belt.  My Bus worked perfectly.. now it
doesn't.. thats what it comes down to. I have to approach them today and decide
whether theyll do the service for free or if I have to take them to court..
it's really not how I wanted my day to go :(.

all the best,

-Richard
