Subject: dent in sliding door track

I took a gamble and shipped a bus back from CA recently. Bought sight unseen
there are many good points and a few strange ones.

The strangest is there is a dent in the lower sliding door rail about a 6&quot;
from the closed position. It seems that the door was pushed down at some
point and the roller dented the rail about 1/8 - 1/16&quot;. As you can imagine,
this makes closing the door fun...

Has anyone dealt w/ this before? Is there a way to fix the dent without
replacing all or part of the rail? My first thought is to simply fill the
dent w/ epoxy, but would like to hear any other options.

On another note - I am parting my old '78 westy if anyone needs anything. I
would love to trade the green plaid fabric for some blue plaid if anyone has
any. Or I'd buy it outright if there aren't any parts that you want.
