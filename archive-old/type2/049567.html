Subject: RE: [T2] vanagon heater location?

I'm assuming your trying to score a BA6, gas heater.

Search the archives on this, and look in the type2 library under Heater for
more information.

You need the heater body.  Tail pipe, the combustion air fan, all the bits
attached, including the sensors and glow plug.  You need the air
recirculation fan, under the Van, under back seat.  All this is smack in the
middle of underside of the Van.  It may be under a subfloor attached to the
bottom of the frame.  Take this too -- it insulated the system from the cold
moving air when driving.

You need the fuel pump and coil, the little coil wire -- also underneath.

You need the triple relay inside the cab.  Not sure where in a Vanogon.  You
need the heater switch with the timer built in (timer lets you run when key
out of ignition -- ie while camping or running in to get kid at daycare).
You need the safety switch, the 2 inline fuses and most of all ...

download the manual and research the job on-line before you get started.
Someone posted an article on doing this.

You can get a manual here.  Get ALL the pages, the later ones are for
Vanogons, and will help you see where all the stuff is.

I have access to a March 81-dated Vanagon; I can have the heater and parts
IF I can get them out without bothering the yard owner :)
Looked under the access hatch and saw nothing; where and what do I need to
remove to get a (hopefully) working heater?
