&gt; Don't leave the 2% low sulfer in your heater fuel tank too long either--

&gt; It absorb's -atrracts moisture big time.
&gt; You'll have jello in your fuel tank in short order.

??? I use 20% biodiesel (BIOHEAT) in my home heating system and have
for a couple years mixed with the new ultralowsulpher dino oil.

old fashioned #2 heating oil.

&gt; The heater line's &amp; burner nozzle will be garbage in short order.

I have had to clean the nozzle on the burner once a year, left some
black &quot;Stuff&quot; on the tips of the igniter but that is all I've found.

not T-2 but relavant
