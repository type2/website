&gt; hey an answer would be great
&gt; my horn is disconnected and if I connect the horn it comes on at random
&gt; intervals
&gt; I have been tempted to do what yoour PO did and rewire the horn withan
&gt; external button.

My experiance has been that the wire inside the sterring Column rubs raw
so all the insulation is worn of the wire ...
When you make a turn the wire moves inside the stering column and grounds out
causing the horn to go off.  THats what happened to mine, i just unhooked 
the horn because its a pain in the butt to replace the wire ....

Hope that Helps....
