Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust inside the bus

Hi Alex,

It sounds like you've done some good investigative work.  However, if your 
RIGHT heat exchanger is bad, it could be dumping exhaust into your heating 
system and still getting fumes in there.  Check to make sure BOTH heater 
boxes are good.

Good Luck!
