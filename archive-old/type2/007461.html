&gt; Ok, it is now becoming clear that saving $100 in shipping by going
UPS vs.
&gt; trucking company was not a good idea....
&gt; 
&gt; Oil cooler was not installed but still damaged.  Entire box was
covered in
&gt; oil, I guess there must have been oil inside the case?!  It leaked
out and
&gt; UPS plastic-wrapped the box somewhere in transit.

Was the engine on a pallet?  My guess is that UPS allowed the engine
to flop over (or even fall off of a stack of parcels onto the floor).

&gt; The studs for the fuel pump are real bad.  One is belt 70 degrees,
the other
&gt; is broken off right at the surface.  Photo here

That looks nasty.  At least the studs are recently installed, so they
will be easier to extract.

&gt; http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/stand/EngineStud1.jpg  (Any clue what that
green
&gt; writing means over the generator stand area?)
&gt; 
&gt; Both valve covers are banged-up and had fallen off with all the
beating.
&gt; One exhaust stud is bent, that is no bigge.
&gt; 
&gt; One head is damaged... at least it seems to me.  The rocker assembly
(?)
&gt; has a spring compressed in about 1/2 inch.  The #1 intake.  Here is
a photo
&gt; http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/stand/DamageHead1.jpg &lt; -- is this serious?

Are you sure that the valve isn't just depressed by the cam?  That's
what this picture looks like to me, though the view is limited.

Seems to me that the engine wasn't properly packed for UPS shipping. 
It should have been in a box with enough padding around it to take the
normal UPS transit blows.  I've shipped transmissions around via UPS
several times without damage, but proper packing is a must.  I hope
that Beetlemex works the bugs out of their packing system, as their
prices are great and UPS shipping allows delivery of engines to your
doorstep anywhere (and I mean _anywhere_!) in the US.
