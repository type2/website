I was about done with a pre-road trip inspection when I came across something I haven't seen before. As I wiggled the CV joints to make sure there's no play,  I noticed that the flange that
sticks out of the right side of the differential -- the thing that the inner CV bolts to -- wiggles a little from side to side. The other side has no wiggle. There doesn't seem to be any noise or
strange behavior associated with this, but I get the feeling it's not supposed to be that way..

I hope this is nothing serious. We've got a 3,500-mile journey ahead to Texas, Florida and many points in between.
