A word of heat exchange caution here is warranted.
Although the same OVERALL heat would be transferred, there is a point 
at which TOO much volume lowers the temperature to a useless value.
Think of the extremes.  A hot metal plate, low volume air = hot temp
extremely high volume of air = slightly warm air.  There is some optimum 
volume point, so experiment.  I would suggest a variable resistor for 
that reason.
High volume to push out old cold air from cab, low volume for 
defrosting windshield.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; Interesting - I was going to switch it, but using a variable resistor
&gt; might be a nice option - of course, I can't remember ever wanting
&gt; anything but MORE heat out of my bus... :)
