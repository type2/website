&gt; Now on to some personal opinions about this subject.  I would NOT use a 
&gt; dinky 30-amp relay.  Drain your battery good and dead and use thick wire 
&gt; and it will fry.  Not to say that you shouldn't use thick wire - you 
&gt; absolutely should.  The problem is related to what the Captain said - when 
&gt; your aux battery is very dead it will draw a huge number of amps initially 
&gt; when it is connected to the starting battery.  Easily 100 amps or 
&gt; more.  This will taper off within a few seconds to ~30 amps and within a 
&gt; couple minutes to around 10 amps (assuming a standard group 24/27 &quot;deep 
&gt; cycle&quot; RV/marine battery).  That initial current surge will eventually fry 
&gt; your buck-and-a-half 30-amp relay.  Maybe not this month or even this year, 
&gt; but eventually it will go.

about the dead battery drawing a huge amount of current when I ran
across a post from Beckett Cantrell which says this:

First, I'm really surprised that among all of the list members, there
is not one single Electrical Engineer who stepped forward to explain
this relay dilemma. So I'll give it to you in a nut shell: Guess what
folks, if your aux batt. is deeply discharged, and you're running 2ga.
wire and a 75amp relay, the batt. will most likely draw 75 amps(or
whatever your alt. can put out) at initial surge. But if you're
running, lets say, a Hella relay, rated at 15amps, with the wiring
provided, and with the same deeply discharged aux.  batt., you are
most likely gonna draw about 12amps at initial surge, and much lower
after a short period of time.  It's all related to the Gauge of the
Wire. Really. Don't buy it? Try this: Take that same deeply discharged
batt.  and run a really, really tiny gauge wire directly from the
positive post of your cranker batt., to the positive post of the afore
mentioned discharged batt. Now start the engine. Did the wire smoke?
Have the flames reached the cockpit?  Are you searching for that fire
extinguisher(that is also probably deeply discharged!)? NOPE. Your
dead batt. will draw what the wire can provide.  Still don't belive
me? Okay, lets see what VW did from the factory: On older models
equipped with dual batts, the relay was rated at 15amps( I'm holding
the original one out of my ' 79 Delux in my hand as we speak) and the
wire from said relay to the aux batt is 12ga. Believe me folks,
nothing can suck down a batt like the old style Dometic 12v/120v
fridges found in the pre-Vanagon Type 2's, and even when these batts
are totally discharged, starting your eng.  does not cause a
pyrotechnic display. If it did, VW would have been litigated out of
existence by now. If that still doesn't convince you, well just flip
through the pages of  Brightons Studies in Electron Flow ( My God, how
I loathed that damn book when I was in college...) to get a clearer
picture.  Your dead batt will only suck up as much as much juice as a
given wire will flow. The batt. is not an active device, like an
electric motor, but a passive one, and will not suck your cranking
batt dry at start-up (Unless you are running Massive gauge wire to the
aux. batt. That is exactly why VW went with smaller relays and wire
gauge.) Think of the set-up as a &quot;trickle charger&quot;. Okay, enough
already.

this seems to indicate that as long as the wire used for the 2nd
battery is small this battery will not draw a huge amount of current
to charge itself, and not need a large wire and relay between the
batteries.

BUT! consider this situation. typical hella relay setup w/ 12ga wire
between batteries and relay. Camper kills battery listening to tunes
while camping w/ friends at BBB and burning the cabin lights. The
camper still has on all the accessories when he starts the bus. What
will happen? I dunno. I suspect that everything will try to pull as
much power as is needed through the little relay and wire, but I am
not sure. anyone have any real input on this? i.e. actually have some
books to back up everyones claims?
