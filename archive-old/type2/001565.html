&gt; I also need a set of engine tins. My bus was retrofitted with one of the
&gt; older (1971-ish?) upright 1600cc engines in place of the original pancake,
&gt; and whoever did the work was apparently unable to find tins to fit the new
&gt; configuration. It's my understanding that some European buses of the same
&gt; time period came from the factory with this setup, so they must be out
&gt; there somewhere.


This is one of the items I have coming on my shipment from Europe, which
will hopefully hit the nearest port any time now.  I'll have a full list
shortly, just as soon as I can find the time to put it all down in writing.
