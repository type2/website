Subject: moving battery, question

I have an '80 Vanagon, which has the battery mounted in a little cavity
under the front passenger seat.  There's also a cavity under the driver's
seat, but to get at it you have to remove the seat, which is a pain in the
rump.  So, since I don't access the battery all that often, and I could
really use another little storage area, I'm thinking of repositioning the
battery to under the driver's seat.

I'd have to extend the wires going from the battery to the starter and from
the alternator.  But I've never dealt with wires of such low guage and high
wattage before, and just wanted to check my idea with the people of list:
I'm planning on simply soldering in an extension and heavily electrical
taping the connections.  Does this sound alright? Am I doomed? Will it work?

ps to all vanagon owners:  you can lock that little box under the passenger
seat by moving the seat over it, and wedging a pen in the mechanism that
releases the seat.  No thief will figure it out, and thus anything in that
box will be secure.  

Thanks all.
