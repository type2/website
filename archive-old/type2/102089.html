Subject: Re: [T2] Highest miles on an upright engine?

My friends bus was a 69 he bought from his friends dad in 1986. Being as 
this bus was from an original owner he had paperwork on it from day 1.

This bus was used from 1968 (being a 69 model bought late 68) to carry the 
family from Issaquah WA (east of Seattle) to California and back yearly and 
for other trips for vacation. It was not used as a daily driver, so it saw 
mostly highway miles for those years.

When my friend bought it, he used it as a daily driver. At some point I 
think in the late 90's that engine was rebuilt. At that point it had 
travelled some 200,000+ miles.

A mobile VW mechanic friend saw 300,000 on his engine he built in the 80's. 
(1641)

Are these exceptions? Yes. I believe most VW uprights in a bus are good for 
about 100,000 tops. But there are those that go further.

YMMV.

&gt;I've been wondering of a 100,000 mile upright
&gt;engine is realistic in a bus(and cost effective
&gt;even if it is achievable).  What kind of miles
&gt;you guys have gotten out of an upright bus
&gt;engine?  If it's nonstock, please let me know the
&gt;mods.
