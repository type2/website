Subject: starter questions

hey now,

in talking to stefan...a local vw'er with quite a cool bus...it dawned on
me that if i can jump start it, then it's not a starter problem right? this
happened to me once in my '74...just oxidized connections. now, would a
vehicle with a bad starter start at all? or would it be the solenoid. anways,
more on this tommorrow...i'm going over to check the valves, compression, brake
s, and hopefully give it a test drive.
