&gt; Trouble is, I only have a bike at the moment, so can only test the

&gt; info re these testers...

The important thing to know about an alternator is if it works or not.
If it produces a voltage increase (from 12 volts with engine off to
13 volts or more with the engine running). Any additional testing is
for the purpose of alternator service.
The idiot light on the dash must function normally for the alternator
to begin producing voltage. (It goes on with the key on, and goes
offty with the engine running).
