Subject: RE: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....Update

Troy,

Somewhere along the line, this is getting waaay to complicated
for an engine that was running fine to start with.

Go back to the basics.


You probably know where the dist was setting in regard to timing to start 
with....put it back there and start over with timing.  Time it static to 
get just close.  clamp it down and leave it alone and look for something 
else.

Why did it come loose???

Look inside the cap(yes, I know you already have..but just in case.).

At this point, got spark?  Got gas? are you still on FI?..I can't 
remember.  Temperature sensor ok?  FI grounds on good and tight?

Troy, It's got to be something simple that we are just overlooking!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; OK, took the dist back off.  Looked down the shaft and tried to move the
&gt; drive shaft  It would only wiggle just a bit.  Moves only when the
&gt; engine is cranked.  Made sure the dist was aligned right with the shaft
&gt; and put it back in.  I got it to where it is tight and does not slip at
&gt; all now as far as the rotor turning  Turns good with the engine  When on
&gt; the notch I am at TDC for #1.  Tried starting it but it still wont go.
&gt; I can get it to go for just a second though if I push the dist so far
&gt; forward that the vacuum can is up near the sensor in front of the dist
&gt; (FIF).  Now to remove drive shaft and put it back in per Bentley? Thanks
&gt; for the help.
