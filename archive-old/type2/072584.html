Mark:  When I first started my 1776 after a rebuild,  the dual Kadrons
popped.  I put ethanol in a squirt bottle and dripped it over the place
where the throttle shafts emerge from the carb body.  Sure enough, the rpm
increased noticably when the liquid touched the shafts.  Evidently there
were air leaks where the bushings have worn and this led to unregulated air
flow and therefore a lean mixture. I had to send mine to the west coast for
rebusing.  When I reinstalled them,  no more pop.

Hope this helps.

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;My '71 bus has a problem I'm not at all familair with.
&gt;
&gt;I put a set of dual dellorto carbs on it after a top end rebuild and have
&gt;no experience with dual carbs. The issue is that they pop....like fuel
&gt;starvation pop....it also diesels badly after turning off the motor. I do
&gt;realize they have to be synched and have been attempting that for the past
&gt;few days....However I've not been able to get it anywhere near running
&gt;corectly. Consensus is that its running too lean. Any advise? Oh yeah,
&gt;it's a '71 bus, 1600 dp, dual dellorto carbs.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
