Subject: Re: [T2] intro (Brief), and question on gauges

Several people replied to my post asking where I put my radio, since I used
up that area for gauges.  Here are pictures of where my radio lives now.
I'm still trying out different ideas but V3b is pretty close to what I'm
gonna go with permanently.  The digital temp gauge on the left is
indicating A/C outlet temperature.  There is a separate digital
indoor/outdoor temp gauge on the right.  I know the face looks cruddy now
but I'm gonna cut a new piece of 1/8&quot; oak with proper holes for the gauges
and paint it white, with the black speaker grill cloth on the bottom as
pictured.  Suggestions welcomed - I'm not the greatest at design (I'm sure
many of you are gonna think, &quot;obviously&quot;!  :-&gt; )

I have new polished aluminum brackets installed that I haven't photographed
yet.
