Subject: Re: [T2] Blinkers dont blink

&gt;	I have a 1971 Bus and my blinkers are not working.  I can turn on the
&gt;hazards or the blinker switch and I hear rapid clicking with the occasional
&gt;slow click where the blinkers actualy light up on the outside.  Otherwize
&gt;its just near solid light on the dash indicator.  Is there a blinker relay
&gt;hidden back by the fuse panel somewhere?  Any help much appreciated.
&gt;  
&gt;
That's exactly right.  It's on the fuse panel.  If I recall correctly 
(my sister had a 71) it's the round one and a new one is cheap and 
available just about anywhere.  Got mine at autozone.
