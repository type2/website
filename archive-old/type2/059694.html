&gt;So in the meantime, I'm thinking about putting my spare 009 in there.

am I losing some 'useful' functionality by removing the vacuum unit?&lt;

David,
        I have been waiting for someone else to bring this up first.  Up
front, I am not that familiar with  T4's but I can say that I have a buddy
that runs a 009/Compufire in his CB case T4 (non-FI) Sand Rail and it runs
really great.

        Now, for what I do have experience with.  My first two uprights
burned valves.  They both had the Sng Vac Adv dizzy.  It was a really
strange deal as both of them burnt the electrode clean off of the plug on
the cylinder.  It makes a real distinct SMELL!  There are LOTS of folks out
there, too, that know this smell, unfortunately.  I have had several others
folks email me with similar stories (ie burning heads quick until dizzy
replacement).

        John Muir, though he died before vac advance &quot;got big&quot;, stated that
he absolutely hated vacuum advance.  Furthermore, he said that air leaks in
this system were the number one cause for burning valves (besides poor
adjustment).  He went on to say that he went to some kind of demonstration
of a &quot;high performance&quot; Vw engined vehicle (?) that actually charged more
for the &quot;upgrade&quot; to the 009 to replace the stock vacuum advance. Whoa!!!
(*note: I do not have the exact words in front of me and this is MY
personal interpretation).

        Experience also says, shifting is not quite as smooth with the 009
but negligable considering the performance/longevity issues.
