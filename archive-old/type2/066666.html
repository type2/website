Subject: Cv swap?

Bob Hoover replyed to my question about my pitted Cv's.
He was adament (sp?) that they indeed are qualified canidates
for replacement. I am hoping to find a good used cv, but
I am unsure of the years of swapability. I have a '74
and have access to some 68-70 busses that the parts
are pretty cheap to get. Will this work? or do I need
like 72 -79? TIA
