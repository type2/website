Subject: Re: [T2] water injection on a fuel injection engine

Busahaulic reckoned, plausibly:

&gt;  the vacuum port on the throttle body would be the point of
&gt;best airflow velocity - or drill another hole in that
&gt;same vicinity directly opposite that vacuum port so
&gt;you could insert the needle a bit into the airflow
&gt;without having to worry about the throttle valve
&gt;(butterfly) hitting it.  A slightly oversized hole with
&gt;a silicone plug that mushrooms out on the outside is
&gt;what I'm thinking.  After proving, the silicone plug
&gt;could be replaced with an epoxy or polyurethane plug
&gt;(the needle, of course sticking in through the plug.)

	This sounds like as near as could be in a FI motor to the 
method I'm now using on my 1600 DP.
	Let me re-emphasize: the needle point should be near the 
middle of the intake pipe, or else there may be some risk of putting 
more water into one cylinder bank than the other.  This would make 
the vehicle steer in a large circle, R or L   ;-}  ...   but even if 
not, it's definitely desirable for all cylinders to be upsouped to 
the same extent, rather than say 10% more power from two of them.
