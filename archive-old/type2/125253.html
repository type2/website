Subject: heat exchanger exhaust fumes

Hey all,

Lately I've been noticing some exhaust fumes coming through the defroster
vents,I must have some leaks somewhere. I have been thinking of re-doing the
whole exhaust since the muffler is not in the best of shape. I see there are
1&quot; 1/2 streetmax  heat exchangers to reduce backpressure, has anyone ever
tried these?, are they junk? waste of money? should I stay with German made
ones?..... also would a header style muffler be worth it to try to get a few
more horses out of my 71 camper

any replies would be helpful,
Al Wanamaker,......
