Subject: Trying to find an oil leak
Message-ID: &lt;Springmail.104.940604594.0.16884800_at_www.springmail_dot_com&gt;

Two weeks ago I dropped the engine out of our '72 Bus in order
to install a new clutch/pressure plate and replace the rear
main seal.  That was accomplished and I no longer have an oil
cooled clutch....

However, the engine seems to have sprung an oil leak at the back!
I removed the oil filler tube to make the removal/installation a
little easier.  My first thought was a leak there, so last night 
I took the filler tube back off, cleaned up the mating surfaces,
made a new gasket (rubberized paper) and put it all back together.

Today it's still leaking and spewing oil all over the heater boxes
and muffler...  

One thought I have is the little rubber/plastic baffle the dip
stick goes through.  It has been removed and installed twice now
and I wonder if it's not sealing properly.  Is this a part you
replace everytime you remove, or can it be re-used?

My problem is trying to track down the leak.  The fan sprays the
oil everywhere along the back of the engine so it's just about
impossible to track down the source.  Any clues in this area?

Thanks
