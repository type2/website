Subject: Re: [T2] one for a very, very slow day

If the lines are tight, then my guess would be the jets are clogged.  Use a 
needle(sewing) to clean them out, and try blowing through them to see if 
they flow freely.  They become blocked from mineral deposits(depending on 
local water hardness) and chemical additives.
