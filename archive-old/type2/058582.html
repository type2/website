Hi,

Does anyone know of any videos on how to work on engines? I know there
are countless books out there and I do plan on getting them.
However, I'm the type of learner that needs to see these repairs in
action to catch on.
If there aren't any, this could be a lucrative market for anyone with
the knowledge of v-dubs to put together such a video.

Thanks in advance

Tina
