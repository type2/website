Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Spam Blacklists

The primary reason this list continues successful is because of the good
efforts of the administrators. It's no big deal finding a bunch of
enthusiasts for any subject, but making a web/email forun/list successful
through the years requires much more. Without the good and thorough work of
the administrators of this list through the years, it would never have
grown into a very effective and sustainable entity.

&gt;Duh! If you're blacklisted you can't write to me. Use my alternate address
&gt;&lt;bighouse_at_mac_dot_com&gt; and your mail will get through.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; meantime, if you find yourself collateralized, let me know and I'll be
happy
&gt;&gt; to set you up an email account from which you can post to the list without
&gt;&gt; fear of being blocked (complete with nifty web-based interface ala Hotmail,
&gt;&gt; you will not have to change the configuration of your mail program).
