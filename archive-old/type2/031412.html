&gt; &gt;Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW

there is a VW dealer North of Baltimore (Cook Motors) that has been very
helpful, there are two folks there who have older VW's and they have even
kept the old parts manuals around...they have rarely had the parts I've
needed but they have always been gracious and have looked em up, even
tried to get me a Canadian Rebuilt type IV engine, and have sent me to
aftermarket places they knew may have had the parts.

the other dealers in town couldn't care less, and have stopped talking to
them, if I ever decide to get a new VW, I WILL go to Cook motors even if I
have to pay a little more

&gt; later I went to pick them up and was shocked to find the price had jumped

different car, I had an old Mercedes, it needed a relay for the AC, the
local MB dealer wanted $79 for the relay and would need a week to get it
in, well as luck would have it we have a Bosch distributor here in
Baltimore and I called them and gave em the Bosch part #, they had several
in stock,  $2.79each...only difference I could tell was that the Bosch
part came in a plastic bag and the MB part came in a blue box, worked fine
for many years until I sold the car.

there is a Bosch part that is used in the Mercedes, Audi And VW.  I priced
the part once and it was $45 from MB, $34 from Audi, $27 from VW and $14
from Bosch....all the same part # (prices rounded)

someone explain that!
