Subject: '76 exhaust manifold

It looks like my #4 exhaust manifold is cracked. I took off the sheet
metal and felt (and heard) exhaust coming from below the bolted flange.
I was hoping the flange was not part of the manifold, but it seems to be
one piece in the manual.

Will this mean I have to replace the entire heater box? It looks like it
to me :(
