Subject: Hall Distributor overhaul

I wrote last time that I could not get the hall shield off of my vanagon
distributor. Karl and Tom both suggested good ideas. Karls
was the best to modify a battery clamp puller to get at it, but 
the only one at the FLAPS had very small fingers on the arms,
and I did not want to pull it at the edge for fear of bending it.

The secret was to put a little penetrating oil on there, wait
overnight, then use bigger screwdrivers right down inside against
the hub groove. (And, peer in and make sure you are not pulling
up against the circlip underneath.)

It finally popped off today. When I disassembled it, I could
tell that it has been apart before and that a shim was installed
that made it too tight for the vacuum unit to work well. 
So, I took the shim out (Bently says 'use enough shims
to limit play.). It now progresses smoothly. I cleaned the
rest of the mechanism, dried it, lubed it with grease and synthetic
tranny oil (my liquid lube of choice.) and reassembled. 
Too cold here to get the feeling that it was all working again,
but we will see as soon as I have a free chance during daylight.

Thanks to everyone who made suggestions.
I wish I had one of those digital cameras so that I could photograph
my procedures and add it to type2_dot_com.
