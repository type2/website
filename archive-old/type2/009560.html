Ok, I did try looking in the archives, but no luck. Is there a way to
put lube in the steering gearbox on a late loaf without removing it?
Mine is a 75. It does not seem to be leaking but it did sit for 12
years while a bunch of bees made the bus their home. And in spite of
their industrious reputation the bees never did any maintenance.
