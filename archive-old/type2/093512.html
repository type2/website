These are interesting opinions.  I personally prefer the type IV engine.  I 
think the exhaust system setup is simpler and it's easier to get to the 
rear bolts to remove the engine...no big fan shroud to have to work 
around.  I wouldn't say one is more difficult to work on than the 
other...they're just different.... my .02$  greg
