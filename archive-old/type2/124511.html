Subject: FW: [VB] Jerome Jamboree Donor List

From The Bus Depot, Inc.

Bless you and Thanks-- 



 Jerry,
 
 Hope this email finds you in better health!
 
 Jon Stanton of the ABC asked me in the spring if I could 
 donate a one of our VW Bus Dinnerware sets as a Jerome door 
 prize, and I told him I sure would. (As you know we always donate
something.)  Where should I send it, and by when do you &gt; need it?  (See

&lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=A9701&gt; if you're curious as
to what it is.)

Also I'd like to send along Bus Depot flyers customized for the
Jamboree, offering attendees a 5% discount on their next order. Can you
make sure they are distributed? (I don't remember how you sent out our
catalogs last year - were they at the ABC booth, maybe, or did you have
goodie bags that you stuffed?)



Jerry,

Actually, now that I look through my past emails (which also indicate
how you distributed our catalog last year, so it answers that question
already) - I see that last year you also put an ad in your Jerome
brochure for us. I have copied the email below that related to it. Can
you do the same this year? I would greatly appreciate it.

- Ron
