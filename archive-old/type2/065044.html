Here's another idea...  Since when is a private publication 
responsible for publishing an unsolicited article and photo 
shoot?  We all may think we have beautiful vehicles that 
would be of interest to others and deserve to be seen, but 
do we have a biased opinion?

I'm not trying to stick up for Hot VW's (in fact, I feel the 
publication has been slipping even further down to the knuckle 
dragger crowd in recent years, &amp; I find little to interest me).  
But the fact of the matter is, there are only so many pages 
they can publish in a year.  Do you realize how many submissions 
they receive &amp; the percentage that actually get published?

I help publish a newsletter for a bus club &amp; we receive a good 
bit of submissions of material (some solicited, some unsolicited).  
Some is good &amp; suitable for publication, some is unfortunately 
not suitable for publication (&amp; sometimes it is solicited).  Even 
the suitable material sometimes has taken months or even a year 
to get into the newsletter due to the volume of material we receive.

We sometimes get calls asking when someone's article will be 
printed.  Just because it doesn't immediately make it into 
publication, don't automatically feel you are being dealt with 
unfairly, and don't let it make you feel that you should not submit 
material in the future.

&gt;Here's an idea....why not get the responses to &quot;Phooey on Hot VWs&quot; 
&gt;from the archive and print them up. There have to be at least 20 or 
&gt;so, right. Then write a nice cover letter politely stating what the 
&gt;type2/vanagon lists are about, and how much NEGATIVE traffic their 
&gt;refusal to print your article generated, and how their reputation 
&gt;really sucks with this group....
