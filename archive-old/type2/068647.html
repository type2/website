Subject: The bubble head scan

  Someone, was it Clara? wanted a mr. bubblehead vw scanned or what
 photo.

 I was out using another friends scanner and copped the HVW figure.
Then the VW logo , and the Wolfgang Heraldic chingadero.

 IN any case if you want, get in touch and we'll work out some means of
transfer.
