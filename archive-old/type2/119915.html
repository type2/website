Subject: Re: Type2 Gas Mileage--biodiesel and burning grease for fuel

Jason mentioned:
&gt; However, I thought that hydrogenated vegetable 
&gt; oils were solid 
&gt; at room temperature (like animal fats)... which 
&gt; brings me to my question... how does one handle
this?  

I suspect this is getting a little off the subject of
air cooled type 2s, but I do know some folks using
biodiesel and also grease to run diesels, and one is a
VW Rabbit pickup.
Biodiesel is a chemically processed vegetable oil
product that can be used like regular diesel, in amost
all situations.
Grease burning cars have seperate tanks for the grease
which are usually heated by water from the radiator to
liquify the grease so it can be pumped, filtered, and
injected into the engine.  The engine has to be
started on regular diesel (or biodiesel) until it
warms up and liquifies some grease.
This is probably a gross oversimplification, but gives
you the basic process.
