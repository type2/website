ok let me put my bus on the line, then you tell me.

&gt; The guys that can get their vehicle's almost ready to paint--

not my bus, not a rust bucket but I put a quick paint job on it 10 years
ago and have been working mechanicals since then, now ready to do the body
up right.

&gt; I'll be there to help out in setting the guys up with the sheet metal
&gt; work, BUT--there is only so many places and things I  can do at one
&gt; time.

mine needs to have some sheet metal replaced, front right corner, needs to
be replaced, right rear quarter panel needs replacing, left rocker panel
needs replacing, both doglegs need replacing  I have all the sheet metal
to do this, but it is a lot of work...   rest is in pretty decent shape
and doesn't need anthing more  than the sand and prime and paint.  few
rust spots but nothing that needs  body work.   have been working on the
underside of the bus and that does need some more welding,

my goal is to &quot;stop the rust permanently&quot; clean and prime underside
basically..not even worried about the final paint job. if it can be done
great but not a major issue at this time.

&gt; I have a  generator--and I'll bring my metal working tools--hoses, a
&gt; couple of extension cords, paint guns, etc.

I have a 3000watt generator, not huge. but not tiny either, hoses,
extension cords out the wazoo, etc.  have lincoln 100 MIG welder and two
cyl.   have fair assortment of tools.

&gt; My compressor is a permanent mount 80 gallon 220 volt single phase unit
&gt; vertical tank unit--so there is no way I'm going to drag that along.

my compressor is a portable C-H twin tank unit, not a big unit but will
handle one persons work comfortably and will run all day without
overheating,   been there done that.

&gt; Here's the basic nightmare--
&gt;
&gt; 4 guys show up--with Buses / Vans that need to be cosmetically
&gt; resurrected from the dead.

well not dead but maybe seriously ill.
&gt;
&gt; There is no way in on this earth this is all gonna get all done in a
&gt; weeks time.

don't expect it all is gonna get done, like I said if the bus is derusted
and protected from rust up to the rockers I will be happy

think there are some decent photos of my bus in the 2003 everybus site.
the blue and white 78 with the canoe on the roof.

&gt; Not unless we all plan on working 24 / 7.

not me, need to sleep occasionally
&gt;
&gt;  I plan on having some fun in doing this project-- and helping you guys
&gt; getting your vehicles panted-- not pushing my body to it's limits.

I had surgery 30 march, and while feeling good am limited in the amount I
can lift, by June I might be up to 25-30lbs, the longer the time the more
I can lift, otherwise no restrictions.

&gt; If the vehicles that show up are close to getting painted--that'll work.
&gt;
&gt; We all can figure on getting at least two painted per day--
&gt;
&gt; This would be a realistic figure--
&gt;
&gt; But on the other hand--if a Bus shows up that needs rocker's , a nose
&gt; section, and quarter panels done--
&gt; and then, sealed primed,and painted--I don't honestly think that this is
&gt; all gonna get done in a week.

well need one rocker, nose?? and one quarter panel, but really am not
expecting to go home with a nice finished paint job...in fact would be
happy as I said if the bottom is protected from rust.

&gt; Lets see how thing's develop---
&gt;
&gt; Get busy---!!!

need work list....need list of &quot;stuff&quot; to bring.  tarps probably if for
no other reason than shade..   where we doing this,  &quot;porta pots&quot;???  are
there nearby cheap motels and food??? will probably want a shower at least
occasionally....I'm good for a 10-12 hour day,  can weld, not up to your
level but the metal stays together.  have grinders, and know how to use
em.  etc, etc, etc.

&gt; Take Care---

almost beginning to think this thing will get pulled off.

Bob
