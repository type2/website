Subject: Re: [T2] ETKA CD &amp; praise for thebusco_dot_com

Family Pictures? Search the Vanagon list archives for ETKA AND Windows 
XP

Or:

http://www.humanspeakers_dot_com/audi/xxxx.htm#top

Or:

Do a full install on the C: drive, then 1) copy everything EXCEPT the 
*.INI files from the CD's ET_PROG.NT4 directory to the C:\ET_PROG 
directory 2) copy LEXHDL5.DLL from the CD's ET_PROG.W95 directory to 
the C:\ET_PROG directory

Me? I just keep happily running it on Mac OS X and VPC running Win 98 
SE.

&gt;&gt; Quite some time ago I purchased one of those ETKA

&gt;&gt; to work. Does anyone have any idea on how to
&gt;&gt; make this work?
