&gt; Another problem we had was with Uhaul.  Don't expect to walk in there
&gt; and tell them you're towing a bus with your pontiac 6000.  They will not
&gt; rent you anything.  Uhaul has some kind of list of vehicle weights and
&gt; tow weights and if you're not towing a smaller car with a bigger car,
&gt; you don't get a rental.  We had to tell them we were towing a PT Cruiser
&gt; to get them to put a dolly on the back of our lincoln.  That was the
&gt; only way they'd rent us anything.

very true, I needed to tow my 78 back from a breakdown in Doswell VA and
the only thing they would let me tow a 4 wheel trailer with bus on it was
their biggest truck.... had to rent a truck to get the trailer...after
towing it 200 miles I was kinda glad I had the truck, a bus is heavy

&gt; Anyway, just be careful, and don't rule out having someone with a
&gt; flatbed bring it home for you.  I had that bus towed from Louisville, KY
&gt; to Buffalo, NY for $400.  It was worth every penny.

yup after that the only way my bus has ever been moved when not driven.
