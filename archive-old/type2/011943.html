Hi Volks!

&gt; &gt; I called this guy because I am looking to buy a 71 bus,  right now. Darn,
&gt; &gt; wouldn't you know, it's  not a 71,  it's a 61- 23 window *deluxe* micro bus.
&gt; 
&gt; That's different...if it's well restored, that Bus is worth what he's
&gt; asking.

And so shall the '71 be, in ten or fifteen years' time.
They're rising.  And there's no reason why they should not
get as far as Splitties did, once they're comparably rare.
(By then, Splitties will have gone even further, of
course.)

No, I don't consider $30k a discussable price for a Bay.
Yet.  But even here in Germany, $8-10k aren't out of
question for a *perfect* early model Bay Westy anymore.
Now think back to '89: what was the going rate for a
*perfect* late model Splitty Westy?  So there.  That's
a $20k bus now.  Do the math.

And the difference will get smaller.  Just like the
difference between split-window Bugs and, say, '66 Bugs
did.  And watch the Super Beetle.  'Nuff said.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
