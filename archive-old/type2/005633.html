steven ethridge wonders:

&gt;what are the pros and cons to downshifting? i know some people who drive
and
&gt;downshift to a stop every time? why? i just throw it in neutral and cost to
&gt;a stop. less wear and tear on clutch and stuff right? Hmmm? I hate stick
&gt;driving and downshifting is like doing double duty.

I learned to drive on a 65 bug, that was in 1969, and have preferred manual
shift ever since.  My method in any vehicle is downshift if you are
descending a hill, otherwise slow down in gear and put in the clutch just
before bus would stall or buck (5-10 mph), then into first or neutral if
it's a long red light.  Neutral and coast makes it harder on your brakes and
almost impossible to make an avoidance maneuver in case the DPO cuts you
off.  MHO
