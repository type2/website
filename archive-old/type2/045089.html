Kevin,

I am a bondo magician, but when it comes to engines I am a deer in the head lights.  I found out for myself that if you can turn a wrench, then you can replace your exhaust yourself.  I wish I had a cutting torch to use, but I ended up borrowing a Saws-All from work, and used it to cut the bolts off.  Actually, I ended up cutting the bolts only 1/2 way through, and using my biggest badest vicegrips I snapped off the heads. It took a few hours (between beers), but I got it all off.  Lucky for me, my manifold tubes are healthy, so I didn't have to go that far.

I ordered used heater boxes and pipes from Jim's VW salvage in Alabama (http://www.skybusiness_dot_com/jimsvw/ ) at $35 for each heater box.  I got an email from them today saying they sent them out today, so I can't say how good they are yet.  But they are also sending me heater controllers for $35/pair with connecting tubes.  I also ordered the $99 special at California Imports (p/n#vwc-071-251-053-ps) with new gaskets.  This part replaces the muffler, cross over pipe, and elbow.  I figure I'll have to go to Home Depot and get bolts, but in All I will spend about $260 in all.

I'm up here in Central NY, but there is a Yahoo VW Club for your area (http://clubs.yahoo_dot_com/clubs/vwheadsonly ) that is based out of Northern PA, Southern NY.  Ask there, and you should get some help there too.

Good Luck,
Snoopster
