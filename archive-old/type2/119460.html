Subject: Re: [T2] Nike Mojo tour

I can't seem to chase up the Mojo Tour Bus ,,, old browser I guess.
Can someone tell me if the Mojo Bus might be near Vegas &lt;Stardust Resort
and Casino&gt; between March 20-26th

I'll be hanging out at the pool... care to join me!
Got any tips for tourists in Vegas?  p-mail me!

&gt; They were right.  The Nike Mojo bus will be at Silverstone Golf Club, form
&gt; 8:00 am until 12:00 pm on Thursday, March 18th.  If you are not familiar
&gt; with Silverstone golf club, we are located in the northwest at I-95 and
&gt; Durango.  If you follow the link provided below, it will give you exact
&gt; directions.
