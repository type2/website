&gt;Anybody close to a 1974 kombi - just a bus, not the camper?
&gt;
&gt;Check the door sticker for the weight - GAWR or something like that.

G stands for Gross, meaning that that's the maximum capacity of the bus
fully loaded.  You have to subtract the cargo capacity (somewhere around
1000lbs) to get the real weight of the bus itself, or better yet put it on
a scale.
