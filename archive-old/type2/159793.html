Subject: Re that oil screen- prompted me to rebuild still running 245K
  78!

Well, in the 245,000 original 78 engine, I was finding on that screen a 
few flakes of what looked like aluminum or bronze in color about 1/4&quot; or 
so across.  Oil was getting dark in about 500 mi. and would leak (oil 
cooler seals) when warming up.  Burned oil visibly only on initial 
warming. Had visions of bearings coming apart?  Everyone thought it 
sounded great.  It ran (with low oil pressure when hot, like 18 at 
highway speeds-to 5 bus events in 2006-even 10 hr to Everybus, but had 
to drive about 55 max to prevent oil going over 240 deg.  The threat of 
it destructing did not gladden the SO.  This finally prompted me to get 
the whole camper reworked, even though I was still getting 110-130 
compression.  I'll let you know what the heads and cam look like, as it 
used TUF-Oil all its life.  It needed FI reworking (believe it, the FI 
train was ORIGINAL, only replaced lines to gas tank.  It needed heat and 
suspension work front and rear, brakes incl. master cyl.) trans is still 
working fine, but I will get a replacement.  - the goal is to have it 
ready for June events.

  In many years of dutifully cleaning the oil screen, I've never found
  anything in it, so I only clean it every 10K miles or so.  I change oil
  every 2000 miles and a touch of hylomar on the old crush washer makes it
  seal just fine.
