Not hated, just aesthetically not as nice.  My personal preference is for
the earlier signals that flowed with the shape of the body.  Also, the
higher signals heralded the smaller emblem.

&gt; A turn signal up high means visibility.  Everybody and their long

I can't argue with you there.  I've pondered creating an auxilary signal
with LEDs inside the vent grill.  Keeps the lines, but makes the signal
more visible.

&gt; Another thought....  A lot of modern cars/trucks have realized the
&gt; wisdom of the visibility issue when it comes to turn signals.  Most
&gt; likely the reason why these same manufacturers are now putting a
&gt; third brake light in/near/on/around the rear window and also moving
&gt; the right and left brake/turn signal housing higher up on the body,
&gt; and not so close to the bumper.

Actually, the third brake light is a federal requirement.  I think tha the
higher signals are more a styling point of the manufaturers than anything
else.

&gt; Assuming that my supposition for the moving of the turn signal back
&gt; up high is correct, isn't it odd that they didn't apply that same
&gt; logic to the rear of the bus as well?  That they didn't also move
&gt; the brake/turn signal housing higher up?  I'm not saying that it
&gt; would have been pretty,

It would have required a much more complex stamping for the &quot;scoop&quot;, and
would have been really outlandish in 1973.  They did improve the signals
(functionally) that year in the rear.
