George,

Whoops...  my fault, I misread &quot;since you are working on steel threads you
probably didn't hurt anything&quot; as &quot;you probably *won't* hurt anything.&quot;  
I did not realize that Jeff had already assembled things.  

I agree that even assembly on pressure plates is key, and that you don't
need the torque wrench for that. Final torques are also important, tho, as
the pressure plate/clutch disc recieves a lot of abuse from shock loads
and it is my understanding that uneven torques will put more load on some
bolts than others with the possibility of failure of the overloaded bolt.  
I doubt that 18 ft./lb. vs. 20 will make a difference, but I think it is
important that all be at the same torque, or very close to it.
