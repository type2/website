Thanks to all those who have helped me with the welding.  I now have in
place sills and repairs down the nearside and work is imminent on the
offside.  My next question is only of interest to those in the UK.  My van
was taxed up until March 1st 99.  I have since been stroing it off the road,
and I should be applying for a new tax disk when nshe finally gets an MoT
hopefully towards the end of June.  However I recently was told that she was
being stored illegally, as any vehicle without tax must be declared to
confirm that it is being kept off the road.  Isolde is an L reg, and
therefore as I understand it, just within the tax exempt bracket.  I am sure
many listees have been in the same position as I am.  Please could you
confirm whether I am illegal, and if so, what my next step should I be in.
Should I declare right away, or just apply for the tax I have missed?
    Thanks for your advice
        Tristan and Isolde
