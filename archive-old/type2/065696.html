Subject: Ball joints and dollars

Hey--
So I called the local rip-off artist (err, VW mechanic) and asked him how 
much to replace my ball joints. $400, says he, but the arms gotta be on the 
car. Now I read somewhere that you can take the torsion arms off the car, 
send them off, and the company (Wolfgang? Bus Boys?) will send you back some 
nice arms with new joints pressed in. What's the going rate for such a 
service, anyone know?

While I'm usurping bandwidth, I like to make a comment. I live in a fairly 
small, midwestern town where the number of aircooleds is small and getting 
smaller each year. The aforementioned rip-off artist makes his living 
keeping said vehicles on the road, yet his prices are at least twice, often 
more,  of similarly priced parts and services elsewhere.  (Example: a 
rebuilt type 1 engine with a line-bored case, no balancing, nothing special: 
$1,600). I know a guy who races a bug who sends his heads to California each 
winter to have them completely reworked (By Berg, I believe--i.e. not 
cheap), gets them back and pays LESS (shipping included) than Mr. RA wants 
for a simple back-shop valve job. Seems to me this guy is shooting himself 
in the foot, and doing no one a favor. If some dude with good intentions 
takes his newly acquired bus to Mr. RA and gets a ball joint bill for more 
than the bus is worth, think he's gonna take it back? Think he's gonna do 
anything else to make the bus roadworthy? I doubt it. He's gonna unload it 
as fast as he can, he's gonna be mad that people lied to him about how cheap 
and easy VWs are to fix, and there's gonna be one less aircooled on the road 
to keep Mr. RA in food and shelter.

Yes, I'm a little steamed. You guys out in California need to know how good 
you've got it.  In the hinterlands, you've got to be able to fix it yourself 
or go buy a Honda. That's what's it's come to.
