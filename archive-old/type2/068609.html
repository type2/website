Subject: Re: Leaky steering box...

&gt;
&gt;Hi all, 
&gt;
&gt;I have a serious question.  I have a 71 bus and the steering box has 
&gt;seemed to developed a leak.. any fluid put into leaks out... I dont know 
&gt;at what rate or how fast yet... but was wondering is there anyway to fix 
&gt;this. It seems to be leaking from the bottom of the steering box where 
&gt;the 4 bolts are.
&gt; (mind you it has been getting worse of the past four years that i 
&gt;have had the bus.)  The steering box came from a junk yard and was in like 
&gt;new condition, the box that was on the bus had way too much play in it.

&gt;anyways ....
&gt;

 There appears to be an o-ring under the cover, from looking at the
BOOK. See no reason you can't handle that.

 Last time I had similar, the bolts were loose. I just re-tightened.
