Subject: Re: Fort Collins CO living

Hi ,
Adam here. I normally lurk on the old digest, but I saw a mention of the Fort and a need for habitat so I thought I'd chip in.
Go to a site called www.allcentral_dot_com.
This is a site for a band called ALL. They are a buch of cool guys from Fort Collins, and they happen to have a pretty good fan base there too.
On that site there's a message board, and (hopefully) a &quot;contact us&quot; link.
Now the message board is full of Punks (I mean that in a nice way) and band members rarely go there.
But if you mention on the board your situation you may find something. Also try the&quot;contact us&quot; link. You could try addressing it to Bill, Stephen, Karl, or Chad (the band) and simply state your plea. They've had to live out of busses, I'm sure they may be able to help you do the same.
Good Luck.
Happiness is questing ALL.

Adam

&gt;
&gt; Hi.  This is a random try, but I have recently been living out of my '79 westy
&gt; on my freinds' rented property, and their landlord explained to me that he
&gt; could not allow it; therefore, I have nowhere to reside in my mobile home.  I
&gt; was curious if anyone on this kind list could help me out with suggestions or
&gt; had a square of land (or garage) they would consider renting.  I am currently
&gt; doing work for a masters thesis at CSU, so I have to stay around Fort Collins,
&gt; but would be happy to pay rent and am completely self-sufficient with my setup
&gt; (no electricity or water needed).
&gt; Your help is sincerely appreciated, and thanks for reading this.
&gt; mark
&gt; ps.  If you could please reply to my email (simon6_at_engr.colostate_dot_edu) then we
&gt; can get in touch by  phone/person.
