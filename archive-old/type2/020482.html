Subject: Still not running (but not stranded at least :-)

Well,

I got some excellent advice from people in response to my last post.
Thank you very much but unfortunately my beast is still lame.

I had a problem with my 77 Transporter FI, MT (electronic ignition - no
points) stopping suddenly. After troubleshooting several things that
turned out to be unrelated, I found that currently I have no power going
to my coil and I can't figure out why??? ECU?? AFM??  It seems like
there should be something that I can, relatively easily, check to
determine why I'm not getting juice to my coil but I can't manage to
figure it out. Any advice will once again be greatly appreciated.

Aloha
