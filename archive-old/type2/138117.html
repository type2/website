Subject: Asian tools

Volks,

When I was in the auto industry (publishing/Professional Tool &amp; 
Equipments News) I had friends who owned Schley Tools (SP Tools) in 
Anaheim, CA and they absolutely DETESTED the Asian import/export guys 
who would come to the ASIA/AAIW show and buy tools to clone as cheapo 
knock-offs back in their homelands.

Drove them batty.

Of interest is that Paul and his brother started in the business doing 
VW mods. (They now race Vipers, though). Maybe some of you know them as 
well?

Good guys. I promised them I would NEVER buy an imported tool. With the 
exception of my Beta Tools (a present from Beta) all of my tools are 
Made in America.

Hm...maybe John Ratzenberger needs to do a show on the Schleys.

Anton
