Subject: [T2] re oil temp

Since their is a lot of talk about temps and oils ill throw my 2cents worth.

Get synthetic, and only Mobil 1.  In my 72 westie Ive tried many different 
brands and types and weights of oils. Mobil 1 synthetic makes my bus run 
10-20 degrees cooler all the time and oil pressure is always up a bit.  Here 
in sunny south Florida I favor 5-50 or 15-50. Ive tried 15-30 but with the 
heat down here the 50 works best. Ive also found that it loses its cooling 
properties over time and when its been in for 3-4000 miles I change it. Itll 
cost you more but it does help.  If anyone is interested I could go on and on 
about my 9000 mile trip around the USA in my westy where I changed the oil 
often just to see what happened to my temps and pressure. I believe that was 
the best test of oils you could have. 

Incidentally it was listee David Schwarze that told me to go with synthetic. 
As usual he was right on the money.

Always wear a clean shirt when traveling with Mr. Schwarze.

All the best,    Marty :)        Hlwd. Fl.
