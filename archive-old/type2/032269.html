Hey everybody, I've got a '77 Westie and its getting some water under the
carpet just inside the sliding door.  I live just north of Seattle so its
only raining 23 1/2 hours a day.  I've checked and its not comeing from
above, so I think that its comeing from under the carpet.  I haven't
pulled the carpet up yet, but I was thinking that it could be a bolt hole
where the middle seat would go on the 9 seater.  Or maybe it could be
comeing up from where the propane tank it bolted up?  If any of ya'll have
had the same thing happen I would like to hear from ya.  Until then, 

Happy Camping.
