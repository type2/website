Subject: Re: [T2] ignition lock removal


The link works from here. If somebody can't get to the page I would be
grateful if you could send a traceroute so we can see where the dead place
is between you and it.

The directory is browseable and poking around is rewarding:

Mike Howles' stuff is always superb, a creative and thoughtful mechanic with
a knack for providing photographs that address the things you are confused
about.

&gt; Apparently maybe something is amiss with the link I sent? Maybe this will
&gt; work. Go to my site and click on repairs/scans on the front page. Then click
&gt; on the link entitled Ignition switch repair. If this doesn't work I am
&gt; sorry. It works on both of my computers (different ip addresses). Just
&gt; trying to help!!
