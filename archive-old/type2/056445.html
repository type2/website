Subject: Mileage on 79 Westfalia

Hi:

I've got a stock 79 Westfalia with California emissions, 135,000 miles on
original engine, stock fuel injection.  Over the last 8 years, my mileage
has ranged between 18 to 23 mpg.  Last week I took a road trip to
Indianapolis over the flat terrain of Northern Indiana in 90 degree heat.
I got 20 mpg, traveling 60-65 mph.

Seems to me that you should be getting better mileage.
