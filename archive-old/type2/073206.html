&gt;The one thing that bothers me the *most* when I travel
&gt;is the way the Pop-Top jumps, rumbles, clangs and
&gt;vibrates every time a semi passes or I get caught in
&gt;strong wind! I have this continuing fear that it will
&gt;open on me when I'm travelling a 60mph!

Go up to the Wal-Mart and get a motorcycle tie-down. It'll be with the
automotive/RV stuff. It's a nylon strap with hooks on either end, and this
special buckle. Put the hooks on the gutters over the B pillars, reef on
the strap, tie the extra strap off. After I did this my top never moved
again. When camping, it can be removed in seconds.
