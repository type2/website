&gt;Dear Mr. Hoover:
&gt;I've read your articles on veedubes with great interest because   I'm
overhauling an '81 &gt;2000cc Vanagon engine and I want to do it correctly. Your
articles are great! I noticed &gt;your article about engine paint and can't find
a good medium temperature paint in dull &gt;black. An auto paint store has Vulux
brand 2 part paint in gloss black that is good to &gt;about 300 to 350 F.  
&gt;What brand and type of paint do you use on the case and cylinders? Please
give me a &gt;shout.
&gt;Thank you,
&gt;Phil 

Phil,

The Rustoleum Flat Black paint I use on Type I/III crankcases, which are of
magnesium alloy, is not suitable for use on the Type IV crankcase, which is
an aluminum alloy.  To form a satisfactory, low 'resistance' bond between
cast aluminum and paint, the aluminum must be etched.  There are special
aircraft primers for this purpose and I know racers running Type IV
power-plants can afford to go the extra mile, but given the excellent cooling
of the Type IV, and the higher resistance to corrosion of the aluminum
crankcase, for a stock Type IV engine the wiser choice for someone rebuilding
just a single engine would be to leave the aluminum crankcase UNPAINTED.  If
you used the wrong etchant you could precipitate future problems with
corrosion and cracking, and if you use flat black paint without etching, it
will come off in a couple of weeks.

The benefits of painting the cast-iron cylinders however is valid for all
types of air-cooled VW engines.  I've posted an article covering the
procedure in the 'sermon' fine.  I believe the article is titled 'Jugs'.

Since the question of painting Type IV crankcases has come up a couple of
times before I'm going to make this a general post.
