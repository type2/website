&gt; Thanks George and Chris for the replies. This was exactly the answers I
&gt; needed. I had checked the Muir manual before asking the question but I was
&gt; either too lazy or just too tired to be 100% sure I could do this with the
&gt; 1971 bus manifold. This will probably be my solution. The next question is
&gt; however: what if I want to run dual carbs?

Martin:
With dual single barrels (Kadrons, ICT's, baby Dells) just plumb your
booster connection into the balance pipe between the two manifolds. With
IDF's, I one did it on a 76, seem to remember that I plumbed it into a
tee put between two cylinders that fired 360 degrees apart.
