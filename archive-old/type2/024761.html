Subject: Windshield installation...
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Going to put my &quot;new&quot; windshield in today. Had no problem with the other 
glass in the bus, but when taking the old windshield out, it cracked VERY 
easily, so now I'm a little hesitant about it. I have checked the archives 
and the library on this, so I know how to do it (the ol' string trick - just 
like the other windows). Words of encouragement, advice, and general 
ramblings will be accepted.

TIA,
John
