Subject: cylander head temperature sensor

Hi everybody, I am just wondering how exactly you test the cylander head
temperature sensor.  There is a description in the library, but there is
no real procedure or reference numbers for testing with an ohmmeter.  I've
been scratching my head and am curious if anybody can give me some info.
