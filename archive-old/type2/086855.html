Subject: Re: [T2] A &quot;NEW&quot; '68 Crewcab?


I just want the drop gates to go on my &quot;real&quot; 68 dc.

Folks, this is essentially a &quot;new&quot; automobile...how much would you pay for
a new one from vw if you could get one from the dealer?

How much were they in 1968-72 dollars?

Just a thought.

Cheers, dave

&gt; As a number have already said, it's obviously a Brazilian DC ( the giveaways 
&gt; would be the Type1 engine &amp; Split style spare tyre storage behind teh front 
&gt; seat, resulting in the bulge at the back of the bulkhead ).
&gt; 
&gt; Really wish I could get my hands on those bumpers for my project DC, though, 
&gt; don't s'pose anyone has a spare set of Brazilian bumpers laying around, have 
&gt; they? ;^)
