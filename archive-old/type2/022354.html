 &gt;Yes, the doghouse fan, for instance, displaces about 35.000 Liters
 &gt;of air per minute at 4000 Rpm, and another 25.000 Lpm through the

 &gt;compartment at 4000 Rpm...

Those numbers seem awfully high to me. I don't think 1000 liters per second 
could even fit through the air vents.

 &gt;My single cab has proven that there is airflow from under the tinware into
 &gt;the engine compartment.

I think it may be possible for the engine compartment to be under positive 
pressure and still have air come in through the open engine hatch. The 
reason is that the pressure is not uniform inside the engine compartment. 
There will *always* be negative pressure in the vicinity of the carb 
intake(s) and fan because there is so much air entering them.

 &gt;I see what you mean.. but the heaterboxes are also connected to the
 &gt;cooling system, and get pressure from there... That explains the increase
 &gt;in air through the heating system as the car moves faster.

My opinion here is that regardless of the absolute pressure at any given 
time in the engine compartment, there is more pressure when the bus is 
moving due to the ram-air effect of the vents. This makes the heater work 
better (and presumably, the engine cool better) because more air is 
entering the fan. It is also true that the airflow increases with engine 
rpm, as would be expected, but that is not the whole story here. I get more 
airflow from my heater at 3000rpm on the freeway than I do at 4000rpm on 
the surface streets right before I shift from first to second gear. The 
ram-air effect is definitely noticeable.

 &gt;These were 'popular' aftermarket items, Kamei made them in the past,
 &gt;for Bugs, Buses, VW used them on the Thing/181, and the have been
 &gt;copied by many fiberglass 'specialists'.

Not for Baywindow busses. I have only seen them for 67 and older busses and 
vehicles with &quot;flat&quot; air intakes like the 181.

 &gt;The thing is, that there is almost
 &gt;no way that you can force more air through the stock fanshroud, that
 &gt;would take a considerable amount of pressure, and might even require
 &gt;special mods to the carb(s)

You can't force more air through, but you can lower the resistance of the 
air that is being sucked into the fan shroud, and that is what I think is 
going on here.

 &gt;The air coming in from under the car through the opening of a missing front
 &gt;breast tin would be preheated by the transmission.

The transaxle does not run hot enough to significantly heat the air at the 
rate it is rushing by.


 &gt;If the pressure is positive, small leaks would be less critical, and not
 &gt;let hot air in, but let cool engine compartment air out.

Again, I think this depends on where the leak is. If it's in the vicinity 
of a large sucking device like a carb or squirrel fan, hot air could still 
be sucked in.
