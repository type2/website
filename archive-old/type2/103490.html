Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Fluid Dye

I don't think this is a good idea--as the food coloring is a water based
product--
It won't mix with the brake fluid, and more than likely will cause some
sort of problem--
No contamination--with anything---

Hello.
I will flush my entire brake system with new DOT 3 brake fluid.
I would like to add some food dye into the new fluid so I can keep an
eye on the new barke fluid (my reservoir on top of my 'new' rebuilt
master cylinder is now clear and clean and transparent, so I could
quickly notice if I exceeded my capacity and picked up air into the
master cylinder).
I put 4 drops (green) in a 12 oz can and refilled my system last month.
I could see the fluid in the line and in the reservoir, and two weeks
later it all drained out of the master cylinder thru the weep hole.
Any problems at that level of dilution or MUST I keep the brake fluid
pure! Again,   M U S T   I keep the fluid pure.
