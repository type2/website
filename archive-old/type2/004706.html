Subject: Bad Cold Start Valve?????
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2000 12:59:46 -0800

Hey all:

Smelling gas back in the engine compartment, I looked and found that
the two short pieces of fuel hose leading to the cold start valve were
drenched in gas and there was gas on the top of the block.  I've
replaced the short fuel hose pieces, but the problem has reoccurred,
though it doesn't seem to happen when the electrical connector to the
thermo-time switch is disconnected.

It seems the next step is to replace the cold start valve, as I'm
guessing that that's the part that's leaking, but these things are
expen$ive.  Anybody have any other thoughts?

TIA.
