&gt;. Don't have a compression checker.
&gt;Went to buy one, but they had a couple
&gt;different types for testing different things.
&gt;Not sure which I need.

You need a compression tester for testing
engine compression, 0-150+ psi.
( I refer to this tool as a &quot;depression &quot; gauge :)
Get one with a hose to be able to get to
the spark plug hole. Remove all the spark plugs.
Install the tester and crank the engine over
with the coil + wire removed and taped.
Install a jumper wire from the top spade
( ignition signal terminal ) on the solenoid,
just touch it to the battery + post.
Key off, you are not trying to start it.
Bus in neutral, wheels chocked, emergency brake on.
Don't need a mechanic for this job yet.
