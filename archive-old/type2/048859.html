George Lyle says about acetone:

&gt; Check the bottle carefully, or just buy the stuff at the local hardware
&gt; store paint department.

Or check the local beauty supply store that caters to hairstylists...they
sell gallons of 100-percent acetone at those places cheaper than the local
Home Depot does. (And no, I'm not going to say how I know this.._dot_caught hell
last time I did.)
