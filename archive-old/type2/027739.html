Hello list, about two weeks ago my bus started idling very fast after it 
warmed up. So I backed out the idle screws on the old kadrons as far as they 
would go. This decreased the idle from 2200 rpm to 1600 rpm, I cannot get it 
to idle below this speed after the engine is warm. I haven't been able to 
find any info on kadrons on the net (perhaps I am not looking in the right 
places) and I would like to find out what I can do about this. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Nathan
74 Bus
