&gt; you know what type it is (type1, type4?)

Yours is aluminum (probably).

IN the US, buses up to '71 used type 1 engines.  '72 and up used type 4
engines.  However, European buses often used type 1 engines well after the
US buses stopped, even into the Vanagon era.

All buses produced in Latin America used type 1 engines, except the
Mexican watercooled buses, which used Golf engines.

South Africa and Australia I don't know about.  According to what I see on
the web, all Austrailian loafs have Rover V8s. :)
