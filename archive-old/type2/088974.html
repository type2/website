Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

Disregard this question!
I was thinking of the 111 798 259A  bug bushing when I asked it. That is the
one almost all the FLAPS pawn off as a bus shifter bushing. Most flaps can't
get the correct 211 711 182 because their wholesale suppliers do not stock it.

&gt; &gt; On one side of the new bushing you put it, did it have a slot running
around
&gt; &gt; it?  Other then the one that the body goes in. If yes, that side goes
forward.
