Evening all ,,i need to let off a little steam ,,so please excuse me ,,,
I take great pride in my work and my workmanship,i have a bus in my shop ,that
was sold to this owner as a restored bus and the man paid a price for it . i
am presently redoing this &quot;Quote &quot;restoration,,inculding have to replace a
nose which was sculpted from bondo and fiberglass ,using screen wire in the
large holes to hold the crap in place ,,,thats not bad enough the &quot;restored&quot;
drivers side rocker was  nothing more than newspaper stuffed in the,,,LARGE
,,rust hole then filled with approximately an inch of bondo ,not to mention
the half gallon of rust and dirt that was still in the rocker also.
 To me this is not a restoration its a ripoff and the person who did it and
the person who sold it should be nutered ,,its crap like this that give
restorers a bad name ,,,sorry to bore ya'll but i had to vent some where ,,or
explode 

Thanks ,,Kelly aka metalwizard
