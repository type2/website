Subject: Re: air-conditioning for a '71?

So Vw says:
&gt; 
&gt; This summer we had our engine die at the beginning of a long trip,
&gt; about 90 miles south of Las Vegas. We were headed to South Dakota in
&gt; our dark blue '71 bus.  Maybe the new speed limit contributed to the
&gt; demise of the engine, because the guy that rebuilt it said that it
&gt; got too hot and pretty much voided the warranty, even though it was
&gt; only a couple of months since the rebuild.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, AAA towed us to Las Vegas, and we rented a Ford Club Wagon
&gt; for the next week. The Club Wagon was nice, went the 75 mph speed
&gt; limit through Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska without any
&gt; trouble, and had AIR CONDITIONING, a nice thing to have in August.
&gt; But it got less than 15 mpg.
&gt; 
&gt; So, now that we have been really spoiled, and since a new club wagon
&gt; costs nearly $30,000.00, what can we do to make the VW bus more
&gt; comfortable?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone tried adding air conditioning to a bread loaf?

Well, I'm suprised there have not been more postings on this.  Maybe
because it's kind of an FAQ.  I would think that you'd first want
to know what the cause was of the over heating of your engine.  I
suspect as with most rebuilds, it was probably the valve getting
out of adjustment.  I've heard this story over and over many times.
You must check the valves after very short miles after a rebuild.
I even recommend to check them after 50 miles of driving.  I've 
found that I could not slide the feeler gauge through several valves
after 100 miles after a rebuild on a friends '68 bus.  You've
really got to watch them.  

Other possible causes for overheating are:

           insufficient engine seals
           time/dwell not adjusted correctly
           air/fuel mixture too lean
           fan belt too loose
           Missing engine tin
           Cooling fan/shroud obstructed

Make sure that all of the above conditions are fixed if they exist.

Once you've got the engine cooling system completely in order, then
you might consider an AC system.  Many VW people won't even consider
an AC system in an air-cooled VW.  I believe you can use one, but you
have to be judicious about how you use it.  For instance, when climbing
any uphill grade, I would turn it off so as not to over-tax the engine.
You're depending on a small 1600 engine to push a great big box and
that is enough of a load already.  When you're on the flat or downhill,
turn it back on again.  Don't drive when it's over 110 out.  That is
just too hot for an air-cooled VW.  Drive in the morning or evenings and
your engine will be happy.  

There is a company in your area called International Conditioning Enter-
prises that specializes in airconditioning for bugs/buses and squarebacks.
Here's their address:

              International Conditioning Enterprises (I.C.E.)
              3295 Market St.
              San Diego, CA 92102
        Phone:(800)845-0424

They are pricey from what I've heard.

Good Luck!
