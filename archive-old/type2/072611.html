Subject: lubricating the shift rod
Message-Id: &lt;v01510104b35543fc2cd7_at_[207.172.52.115]&gt;

In my permanent quest to dig deeper and deeper into the bowels of my '71
Westy, I have removed the shift rod.  Chris Chubb paved the way  by his
reassuring message.  Now I can see for the first time those two nylon
bushings.

I had assumed that the bushings were stationary and that the rod slid back
and forth in them. To my surprise, I now see that each bushing is
&quot;attached&quot; to the rod by nubs.  This means that the rod/bushing combo
slides in the tube.  This means further that it would be good to have the
area where this takes place lubed with grease.  One of those areas is about
two feet from the end of the tube.

Has anyone come up with a way of insuring that a big hunk of grease gets to
those two sections of the tube?
