Subject: Re: Secrets for Removing Slotted Plugs?

[...]


&gt; Does any one have a technique for extracting a slotted
&gt; plug (4 actually) that have been locktited in. They're
&gt; in the holes which go from (next to) the intake
&gt; manifold down into the exhaust port (1700).  I want to
&gt; remove the plugs and use the large hex bolts which are
&gt; supposed to hold the tin AND plug the hole.
&gt;
&gt; The plugs are about 1&quot; down in their holes. I'm going
&gt; to try grinding down a screwdriver, but so far its
&gt; looking grim.  I don't have a torch.  Any ideas?

Sounds like you have a pair of air-injected heads and you no longer have the
air [smog] pump?

They did not use 'large hex bolts to hold the tin AND plug the hole'. The
'bolts' were hollow to allow air to be blown into the exhaust. The threads
of the 'bolts' and head were metric flare thread.

Someone maybe used pipe thread plugs in the holes?
Maybe they didn't cut new threads and just screwed the pipe plugs in till
they got tight? If this is the case, you may never get them out....
