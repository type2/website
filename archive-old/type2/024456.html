G'Morning Folks,
     Yesterday, after 4 months of work (replacing axle beam, ball joints, 
brake lines, fuel lines,etc., etc.) I finally got to drive my '77 on the 
road. First stop was the gas station to buy a whopping $2.00 of gas (still 
need to replace the fuel filter and line coming from the tank, so I didn't 
want a full tank), then with fire extinguisher by my side I hit the road. 
Everything went pretty well, only problem I noticed was brake pedal travels 
further than I feel it should, pumping helps a bit (master cylinder?) but in 
several &quot;panic&quot; type stops it stops well, no pulling to either side. Now, 
here's a good one: While it's been sitting in my garage I've been putting 
things I've taken off up on the roof. I thought I had removed everything, but 
after returning home from a 15 mile drive (including 2-3 miles _at_ 55 MPH) I 
noticed the sliding door track cover still on the roof, right at the edge, 
about to fall off. Very lucky. I'd have been really p*ssed off if it had 
blown off, especially on the highway where it most likely would have been run 
over before I could get to it. Hope to put a few more miles on it today.    
Jeff S.
