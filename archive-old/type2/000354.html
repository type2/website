Today, was a great learning experience.  I think I pissed the VWGods off
when I posted the progress from the last 3 days. Or else my supply of good
karma is wearing very thin. Real quick, this is the stuff that I did today
besides the pop-top canvas.

Got to the garage early. Ran aux. circuit for accessories from the 4ga. wire
I ran earlier to two fuse blocks of three outlets, one switched by a relay
and one directly from the battery.  Installed the sliding door track cover,
opened the sliding door and bent the S__t out of the corner. Anyway, Tom
(painter) agreed to fix all of my &quot;accidents&quot; and chips after I got
everything in. I installed the deck lid, rear license plate light,cleaned up
my tools, nuts and bolts, added a couple of little things like head-light
rings, finished installing sound deadener and any thing I could think up so
I wouldn't have to start on the poptop canvas.

The pop-top canvas is going to be day five and I'm sure the title will be
the Pop-top from hell. There's got to be an easier way to do this.........
c-ya all later

PS If anyone can give me some clues as to why I smashed the corner of the
Sliding door track cover, I would REALLY appreciate it..........TIA

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
