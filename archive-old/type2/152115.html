&gt; &gt;any ideas on what a fuel injected westy gets?
&gt;
&gt; The EPA says 17city/25hwy but I've never met another bus owner that gets that using the stock ignition system.
&gt;
&gt; 17city/21hwy is more reasonable to achieve.

my drop floor 78 is probably about as heavy as a Westy
with auto tranny   15city/18hwy   (19.5 downhill with tailwind)
