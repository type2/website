Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure gauges

As far as oil pressure gauges go, I don't even bother trying to mess 
with a place to mount them up front, or running wires/tubing the length 
of the bus.  For mine, I just take out the oil pressure sensor from the 
case, install a 3&quot; or so piece of 3/8&quot; threaded brass pipe, and a T 
fitting on the end of that.  On the end of the fitting I put the oil 
pressure sensor in there.  On the bottom of the T I install the oil 
pressure gauge (get one that will thread right on, I used a Stewart 
Warner mechanical one - was like $15 or so, but that was cost, dunno 
what list is on it) right onto the T fitting.  Get one with a light in 
it if you like, so that it will be lit so you can see it easier in the 
night time.  I go with the basic ones that have nothing else except the 
threaded pressure port.  Doing this will have the gauge facing you and 
sitting to the left of the distributor.  Its in the way of nothing, and 
is quite convenient and easy to read.  You can't read it while you drive 
though, so just pull over to check it, or stay back there and rev the 
motor to check it.  I like mine.  Having an oil pressure gauge gives me 
a bit of reassurance that my motor is alright.  Engine temp can go as 
high as it will, as long as I still have oil pressure, I'm cool with 
that....well to an extent 8)
