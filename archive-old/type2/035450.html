Subject: Re: heat smells like exhaust

First you have to realize (I'm not saying you don't) that exaust pipes go
through the heater boxes.  That would be my first guess as to where the
fumes could be coming from. When I first started running the heat in my van
it kinda smelled like exaust too so I went and bought a CO detector (which I
highly recommend you do... at $20 a pop just call it cheap life insurance).
Needless to say it never went off and after running the heater every day for
about a week the smell has diminished.

&gt; What is the most likely cause of the fumes?
&gt;
&gt; As I understand it, the fresh air flows through the engine compartment,
&gt; through the fan, where it is pushed out the heater hoses into the heater
&gt; boxes (heat exchangers), then through the ductwork up to the vents on
&gt; the dash board and elsewhere in the cabin. If there is an exhaust leak
&gt; somewhere in the engine compartment, those gases would get sucked into
&gt; the fan along with the fresh air.
&gt;
&gt; The seal around the engine door is a good one, as is the seal around the
&gt; back of the engine by the pulley. The front seal has some problems, but
&gt; it seems to me that the front of the engine is the least likely place for
&gt; exhaust gases to collect. Is it more likely that there is a manifold
&gt; problem?
