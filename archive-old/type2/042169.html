FWIW, the best deal that I've found on REALLY remanufactured halfshafts is,
believe it or not, NAPA.  List price, $99.67. (And if you talk real sweet, you
can usually get the next price break, around $75 ea.) &quot;Lifetime&quot; warranty. 
Hard deal to beat.  'Bout the same &quot;list&quot; price as a c-v joint.  I've used
them on all types of vehicles from AMCs to Volkswagens.  Haven't had one come
back yet.

&gt; Sure,
&gt; 
&gt; Remanufactured and possibly also 'rebuilt' can mean that the USED item was
&gt; inspected and found to be OK, so it is cleaned and reused.  As an example if
&gt; there is a used axle and one joint is bad, but the other is OK, both joints will
&gt; be cleaned and repacked and the axle will be sold as 'remanufactured' or
&gt; 'rebuilt'.  I do not consider this to be remanufactured or rebuilt.  My
&gt; definition would be that all tolerances are checked and made so that they conform
&gt; to a NEW part, not simply still in the tolerance band of a used part.  I expect
&gt; to get almost the same life out of a remanufactured or rebuilt part as a new
&gt; part, not just the rest of a used parts life
