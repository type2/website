Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of basic items...  Electronic vernier caliper

&gt;&gt; Back in December, I discovered, ordered and received a digital electronic
&gt;&gt; vernier caliper from Maryland Metrics for $31.85.  I thought the sale
&gt;&gt; ended on 01/01/02, but it has been extended to 03/31/02, so I want to
&gt;&gt; recommend this to all.
&gt;
&gt;How can a caliper with a digital readout be a vernier caliper?  Does it
&gt;have a auxiliary vernier for when the battery dies?

You know most of them do actually, or did until a short while ago.  The
Mitutoyo used to have a pretty much standard vernier scale etched on
the digimatics probably to 0.005&quot; resolution or so.

&gt;I guess I like the old fashioned variety.  Kind of a entrance exam to the
&gt;trade!

Well vernier calipers are pretty useless resolution for the trade so I don't
know they were ever of much use, save maybe woodworking.  Now dial
calipers are fine but aren't a whole pile harder to use than a digital model.
Vernier micrometers to 0.0001&quot; are of course still the norm and if you
can't read one, I agree with George you got no business using one
or touching a machine.  Machinists are funny, one of my best friends
is one of the best I know, he can carve up metal on simple machines in
ways that $100,000 CNC machines can not, he did all our prototype work
at the rocket factory.  This guy didn't finish high school but can figure
mathematically as it relates to machining faster than I can pull out a
calculator, which I pretty much do to add 2 and 2.
