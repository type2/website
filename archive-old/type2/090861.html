Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak: how much is too much?

It will be best if you get your oil leaks fixed.
Other than just a mess on your driveway you're driving with a fire
hazard.
Oil collects in the lower push rod covers and can flame. If they flame
your fan shroud is made of magnesium and if it ever catches fire you can
kiss your bus goodbye.
