Subject: RE: [T2] ign switch part question

hmmm....this is really odd. i am finding that 311 905 865 A will definitely
*not* fit the housing i have, which accoring to the numbers in this quoted
post, DO fit 68-69:

Year Period		Steering Lock Hsg		Lock Cyl w/Key		Ignition Switch

68-69			211 905 859			211 905 853 A*		311 905 865 A

there are clearly 2 'notches' on the electrical portion (aforementioned 311
905 865 A) that do NOT line up with the 69-69 housing (211 905 889).

are there any other ign. switch part #s out there i can try?

thank you *very* much 'OldVolksHome' for the fishe info.

i open to any other suggestions at this point! this has been a royal PITA.
thanks to anyone for replies/ideas. should i just maybe try to go with the
later year since it might be more readily available? if so, who has a late
model housing want to sell me one?!?!?!?!


TIA,

Joel

211 905 889 is the casting number which translates to VW Part Number
211 905 859 which fits 68-69.  According to my 1975 dated fiche it
should take the 311 905 865 A Ignition Switch (which also fits the
1970 only Steering Lock 211 905 859 A).  Some of this info doesn't
show up in ETKA anymore.

Here's a reference list I developed for late Bus Ignition Switch/Lock
Components:

Type 2 68-79  Ignition Switches &amp; Steering Locks

Year Period	Steering Lock Hsg	Lock Cyl w/Key	Ignition Switch

68-69		211 905 859	211 905 853 A*	311 905 865 A

1970		211 905 859 A	211 905 855**	311 905 865 A

71-Early 74	211 905 887 D	211 905 855 C***	111 905 865 F
(To Vin 2x4 2164 059)

Late 74-79                211 905 851 BH	211 905 855 C***	111 905 865L****
(Fr Vin 2x4 2164 060)

Asterisk notes for above
*Superseded (Can use 113 905 853)

&gt; i have the housing which is part # 211 905 889. i thought the electrical
&gt; portion of the switch, part # 311 905 865A, but apparently it is not?
&gt;
&gt; can anyone *please* suggest an alternate ign. switch part # which might
mate
