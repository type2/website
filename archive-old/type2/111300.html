Subject: Hard start and dies when accelerator is pressed

Hello List,

I have a vague question. I replaced my fuel pump today
because the old one leaked. I have been having a
problem where when I first try to start my bus, the
engine turns over forever before it finally starts
&quot;catch&quot;.  When it does this I cannot press the gas
pedal because it will die. After trying to start the
bus for 5min or more it will finally idle somewhat and
will let me put a little pressure on the gas pedal but
I still cannot rev the engine or it will die. After
about 10-15 minuets of idling roughly, it allows me to
rev it but if I back off the pedal too quickly it will
die. I am getting fire at all cylinders and changing
the timing doe not make this problem any better. I am
running Pertronix ignition and my dwell was 54 the
last I checked. Once the engine gets good and hot, I
get around 12-13 inches of vacuum at idle. I can't
figure this out. Any suggestions? This is a rebuilt 2L
914 engine w/ fuel injection from a 77 bus, with no
driving miles on it after break in. I was getting
about 17-18 inches of vacuum at idle a few weeks ago.
I used a section of fuel line to try and listen for a
vacuum leak but I found none. The brake booster is not
currently connected and that vacuum port is blocked
off. Hmmm. I don't know. Thanks in advance for any
help!
