Subject: E-brake Lever Pins

Friends,

Am I going crazy?!?! A couple months ago, after discovering that my old rear
brake shoes hat the riveted e-brake lever, I looked around and SWEAR I found
replacement pins and c-clips that would allow me to install my new brake
shoes.  NOW I CAN'T FIND THEM AGAIN!
I've checked the online vendors and even wrote the the Bus Depot but nobody
seems to have them.

Somebody out there put my mind at ease. Did I dream this or are they
available from an online vendor? Any info is appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Dave
