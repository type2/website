zero emissions just means the car doesn't  emit.  the commercials never talk
about how much more is going to be emitted from the eletricity plants that
have to power these cars. 

all we do is go from a bunch of smaller polluters to a couple of really
large pollulters, unless we are able to move to renewable energy resources
to power the plants.

John-
        ...Not to throw more coal on the fires, but are the emissions being 
counted in
manufacturing even a zero emissions van?
