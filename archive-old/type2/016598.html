&gt; Does anyone know where I can find Jets for this Carb??  I have called around
&gt; to local FLAPS and everyone tells me good luck.  I am having an over heating
&gt; problem on my new rebuild 1776 and think that the problem is in the jetting.
&gt; Spark plugs are white grayish color.  I would like to find a different
&gt; assortment of jets to try.  Once I have the Jets reamed out I can not go back
&gt; so I would like to have some back up.  I thought that someone said that you
&gt; could find jets from a motorcyle dealer but am not sure which one it was.

There used to be a place called European Parts on the west coast that
specialized in type 4 parts. They had Brazilian Solex and I bought a lot
of jets from them (mid 1980's). They were a big company, had a nice
catalog, etc, anyone know if they are still in buisiness? At that time
they were really knowledgeable and nice to do buisiness with.
