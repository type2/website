Subject: Good San Diego Bodyshop?

Hi All:

I posted this question a while back with no luck so here goes again.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a good San Diego, CA bodyshop? My 71
Westy needs paint and the usual rusty windshield area fixed. I'm looking for
someone who knows VW's, particularly the rust problems, and will do a
professional job.

Thanks!

Kevin Meadows
