Subject: re: [T2] 1700 valve adjustment

--part1_1be.e1383cd.2abda088_boundary

what you wrote sounds correct for the valve adjustment, but... if you read 
the same muir i do, you have to mark your crank pully before all else, it 
needs to be marked at TDC for #1 , once you have that marked, everything else 
is cake, point the rotor to the number one spark plug wire on your dist cap, 
line the mark on your pully up with the split in your case, (these two things 
will happen simotaneously) ...  you point the rotor first to get it close to 
TDC, then to get it exactly to TDC you line the mark up. about your belt, im 
not sure about on a 72 but make sure you have the correct number of shims 
behind the gen/alt nut, and probably invest in a new belt for peace of mind 
=) .. hope i helped, and never be ashamed to ask any question thats why the 
list is here , nobady was born a VW expert.. good luck peace.. Scott 71 vesty
