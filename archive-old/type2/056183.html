Subject: front brake squeal on '82 Vanagon

Well at least the problem is not intermittent now. A year ago the front 
brakes would squeal just every now and then. Then it got a little worse to 
the point of my son and his friends timing the squeals to see who could time 
the longest (I think 13 seconds was the record). So I replaced the front pads 
with softer ones and the squeal went away for a while but as of a week ago 
it's there every time I stop. I was told by a &quot;former VW mechanic&quot; when I 
went to pick up a set of softer pads that the anti-noise shims (which were 
missing when I bought the bus) never really worked.... softer pads was the 
solution.... well it's not in this case. Last week my son knew I was coming 
home cause he could hear the brake squeal about a quarter mile away. Stealth 
Vanagon it isn't.... 
In the archive I read about some goop to put on the pads. Name brand? Does 
the stuff really work? Is there another solution? Till whenever if you hear 
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, it's me coming.

thanks

Greg
