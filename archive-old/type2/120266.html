Well, the stock 1600 isn't exactly a torque monster!

I think that the mazda rotary is a good match for a bus, allowing good top
end speed without having to change the transmission ratios.  150HP will
allow the bus to climb hills at a reasonable rate.  140 ft-lbs of torque
at 3500 compares favorably with any of the stock engines.

No, the bus won't perform like a RX-7, but Dodge pickup owners don't
expect Viper performance even though they share the same engine.
