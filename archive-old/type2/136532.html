Subject: Bleeding brakes... problem

Just replaced the leaky master cyl, shoes, rear
seals, and freshly turned drums on my 70 bus. 
Brakes are still spongy.  I searched the archives
and see that I have more work to do adjusting the
brakes.  Posts by Dolan and Tommy of Volkswagen
Restoration are most helpful.  I'll work on
readjusting the brakes again tomorrow.

However... I noticed whilst bleeding the brakes
that my right rear has very little pressure.  The
fluid sort of leaks out when the bleeder is
opened.  Ideas as to the cause?

Happy bussin'
