&gt; Hi George,
&gt; 
&gt; I think that most radios have an internal AM antenna while the
external
&gt; connection is for the FM band. I havent messed about with car radios
much
&gt; for awhile but I know you used to be able to pull antenna cable off
the back
&gt; connector of the radio and still get AM signal. The AM antenna is a
wire
&gt; wrapped ferrite(?)  bar, so you have two different antenna systems.

This is true of portable radios, but not of auto radios.  Auto radios
are mounted inside a steel body that blocks most radio waves, so an
external antenna is needed to get the signals into the car.  In
addition, most car radios have a metal case which shields the
circuitry from stray RF floating around the car (alternator and
ignition noise).  Expecially strong signals might get into the radio
circuitry, which is why the radio might work without an antenna
attached, but useful reception requires the antenna.
