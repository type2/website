Subject: Hard start when cold

Hey all,
'81 Vanagon, 2.0L air-cooled engine, rebuilt AVP heads.

I've noticed recently that the van doesn't like to start easily when 
it's cold.  By cold I mean around 60-70 degrees here in the morning in 
the D.C. area.  When I initially turn the key to start, it will crank 
and crank but will not start, no matter how long I crank it.  However, 
if I stop cranking it, turn the key off and then back on and to start, 
it will start right up.  So it will not start on the first attempt, but 
will always start immediately on the second attempt.

It always used to start easily on the first attempt.

I have recent points/condenser (just checked points today, they are OK), 
new spark plugs, recent spark plug wires, recent distributor cap and 
rotor, coil makes a nice blue/white spark, valves are properly adjusted 
(though this did seem to develop after adjusting the valves, which would 
seem like a major tip-off if I didn't know that I adjusted them 
correctly).

The engine starts quickly and easily when it is warm or hot.

Any ideas?
Thanks,
