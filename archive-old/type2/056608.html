Subject: Front Door Window Screens - how to:

I posted this a few years ago, but since its Summer time again and
there's a lot of new folks on the list, I'll post it again.
-------
I made some screens for the front door windows of my 73 Westy out of
some mosquito netting, some magnetic strips, and a hot glue gun.  It
took about 1 hour from start to finish and I'm VERY pleased with the
results.  Now I can leave my windows rolled down at night and not get
eaten by the mosquitoes.

Here's a brief how-to, but if you need more info, e-mail me and I'll
help all I can:

1.  Cut the netting (available at Army Surplus stores - I got mine at
the local Cloth World - any fine netting will do) to an approximate size
to cover the window.  Make sure you leave several inches extra, just in
case - this will get trimmed off after you're finished.

2.  Fit your magnetic strips.  (I got mine at Michael's - a local craft
store.  It is about 1/2 inch wide and came in little rolls of about 3
foot each and had self-adhesive backing on one side which made gluing
the netting to it easy because it helps hold it in place while you
work.)  Just stick the strips to the inside of the door (with the
magnetic part, not the self-adhesive!) and cut the ends to fit.  Don't
leave any gaps anywhere because those damned mosquitoes will find them!
I cut my corners with a 45 degree angle so the 2 pieces meeting there
would match up nice.  Oh, by the way, these go all the way around,
including the vent wing.  If you want to be able to fold your screens in
half for storage later (I store mine flat so didn't do this), make a cut
in the magnets opposite each other - then you'll be able to fold them
away from the netting side.

3.  Pull the backing off the magnetic strips and press the netting onto
it.  This won't hold real well so its best to do it out of the wind and
it really helps to have an extra set of hands.

4.  Fire up the hot glue gun and start gluing.  I started in the top,
rear corner and did the top first, then the rear side, then started
along the bottom.  VERY IMPORTANT - if you want to be able to leave your
vent wing open with these in place (helps grab every little breeze at
night), open your vent wing BEFORE gluing the whole bottom and any of
the front edge in place.  Just leave the netting a little loose in this
area and it'll work fine.

5.  Let the hot glue cool or dry or whatever it is that hot glue does,
then trim the excess netting off with a blade or scissors and you're
ready to go!  For storage, I stick the two together and lay them on top
of the metal roof up under the pop-top.

If you do this, I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!  It makes camping
in the South Texas Summers a little more bearable.

Happy motoring
