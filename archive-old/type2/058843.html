My bus (1972 Safare) will probably be stored outside under a paved car port (Montreal, Canada) for the next 12 months or so (maybe longer). Should I put it on blocks to raise the wheels off the ground, or should I overinflate the tires to about 60 psi? I had 2 conflicting statements from 2 mechanics. Also, the body and paint were completely redone a week before I decided to store the bus. Any particular recommendation to protect the paint and keep rust away? I remember coming accross a comprehensive &quot;How to store a bus&quot; page on the internet. I live in the High Arctic where internet connections are slow, unreliable and cost a fortune, so I can't really spend too much time searching for that page.
Thanks. Phil
