Subject: UFO's in distributor

Hi list-me again with a problem that doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the
archives. Today, while trying to get the carb dialed in on my 78 Westy
(Weber conversion) I found something I have never seen before. Started the
bus, started fine, almost eagerly. Ran great for about 30 seconds, then
died. Would NOT restart. (Luckily, I'm in my own driveway at the time) So,
I start checking the basics. I smell lots of gas from all the cranking and
cranking, so I assume fuel supply is not the problem. Check all the usual
suspect wires, everything where it should be. Hmmmmm. Pull of the
distributor cap, and, whadda ya know, tiny little parts floating around in
there! I fished out what seems to be a tiny bullet, about 3/8&quot; long by 1/8&quot;
in diameter. Looks JUST like a little bullet, even feels like lead or
another soft kind of metal. Along with it, but not attached to it, was a
little spring, kind of like a ball point pen spring, but not as long. It
was actually about the same size as the tiny bullet. I assumed that they
came from the points assembly, but when i compared a new set of points that
i just happened to have, I could not find any tiny bullets or ball point
pen springs. What the heck are these things, and how did they come to be
floating around in my distributor? I have another distributor that I'll put
in when I pull the engine to change the front and rear seals (and probably
clutch too, now), but I am just curious as to what these little mystery
objects are. Anybody ever put an 009 on a carb-converted 2.0? Any reason
why I couldn't do that, since the FI is out of the picture? Thanks for
taking the time to read my ramblings!
