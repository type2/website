Subject: Great Buy on '75-78 Exhaust System!

A few years ago, I was selling an Italian made Ansa exhaust system for the
'75-78 bus (non-catalyst).  This was a one-piece system that replaced
everything behind the heat exhangers, and looked pretty close to &quot;stock&quot;
except that it didn't use a crossover pipe.  It was nearly the same build
quality as the stock original muffler, except that you didn't need the
(unavailable) crossover pipe to use it since it's fully self-contained.
Picture a stock '75-78 muffler with the tailpipe welded right to it and a
direct &quot;extractor&quot; connection to the heat exchangers instead of the
convoluted crossover pipe setup that Volkswagen used. And yes, it does have
the port for the EGR.

Unfortunately, Ansa discontinued the unit, and in the two years since then
I've been unable to find a comparable quality unit for anywhere even
remotely near the price.  The closest I could find was the Mexican made
Pacesetter system, for about the same price, which is similar but definately
not as heavy-duty.

The good news is, I just located a dozen of these new-old-stock Ansa
extractor systems.  Half of them will be here on Monday, and the other half
the following week.  Once they're gone, it's back to the lower-end Taiwanese
and Mexican systems, which incidentally sell for about the same price.

If you need an exhaust system for a '75-78, or will need one within the next
year or so, you should grab one of these before they're gone. It's worth
stashing one in the garage for later considering the fact that this is the
first time (and probably last time) they've surfaced in two years. You can
order one via the website starting tomorrow, part number VW0497, or of
course you can call or email to place your order.  The price is $99.95 (plus
shipping).
