Subject: splined hubs

Gentlepersons-
                       Anyone out there in etherland know of source for 
splined hubs? Not for
a specific car (that's the easy answer), but splined hubs in general. Any 
machinists
with info? I have a few wooden rims from steering wheels from unknown cars, 
as well
as centers and arms. I also have a lovely &quot;Brooklands&quot; (&quot;banjo&quot; style) wheel 
with most
of a center - no hub - that I'd like to use. My thoughts are, that the 
splined hub is pro-
bably not manufacturer-specific...Aftermarket wheel manufacturers probably 
don't
make their own hubs...They might be off the shelf items, i.e. inside 
diameter, outside
diameter, no. of splines, etc. , like bearings, if you will. Any ideas?
Thanks in advance.
