Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Stud Dilemma

Maybe the other Chris knows... I drove my Beetle around Naples for a week 
with NO muffler - just the two front heater boxes. Besides making a whole 
heck of alot of noise and scorching the paint on the apron nothing bad 
happened. However that is when an Italian mechanic friend warned of 
cracking valves. He spoke Italian and I almost spoke Italian so despite the 
fact that we enjoyed visiting and working together, our conversations never 
got too deep.

(Funny story: I knew he had a brother living in America (citizen) but I had 
never met him. One night Maurizio comes for a visit and brought along a 
mutual friend named Gennaro. In comes Maurizio speaking fluent English 
about a mile a minute with NO ACCENT. Completely floored me. Then a few 
seconds later in walks the REAL Maurizio for a double whammy on the shock 
factor. He never told me his brother was a TWIN brother...)

I'll try to look around and see if I can find out some truth on the 
cracked/burnt valve concept.

Maybe one of our resident professional mechanics could chime in???



&gt;Please note that Chris says &quot;directly&quot; into the exhaust port.
&gt;
&gt;If the cooler air has to travel up the whole length of the exhaust...then
&gt;it's a different deal.
&gt;
&gt;Also, Chris, is there a cam position where both exhaust and intake valves
&gt;are open at the same time?....did some thinking on the hot valve vs. cold
&gt;air stuff some time ago and couldn't decide if it was an urban(vw) myth
&gt;or not.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I drove it for about a month with no
&gt; &gt; &gt;exhaust (you can see hot gases shooting out and onto the ground from the
&gt; &gt; &gt;head as you drive) pretty dumb move.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; FWIW I'm told if the cold air gets sucked into that exhaust port and hits
&gt; &gt; the red hot valve you stand a good chance of cracking the valve or the 
&gt; head.
