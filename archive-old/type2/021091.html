Folks...
    Why not take the time to get a Ham license?  Rather than 4 or 5 mile
range you will have from 10 to 5000 miles, a wide choice of frequencies
best suited to the particular communication task, telephone access over
much of the country via phone patch, and lots of new communication modes
from TV to satellite to Digital?

Subject: Re: [T2] CB Antenna question

There are nice small antennas for CB, but they don't work very well.  A
quarter wave on 27MHz is a bit over 100 inches long.  that's the antenna

length you want.  You can get a long whip, or you can try to fool mother

nature by wrapping the antenna into a coil.  You can fool the
transmitter,
but your radiated signal is pretty much a function of the antenna
length.
The best compromise is a 4-foot firestik antenna, commonly available at
truckers outlets.  It works reasonably well but isn't all that long.
