Subject: Re:bus utility

speaking of bus utility, last summer i took a trip
with my girlfriend down to VA Beach(from
Pennsylvania). we drove down with her dad and step
mom. i had a vanagon at the time, therefore i got
volunteered to haul EVERYTHING! i remember her dad
loaded me down with 3 bags of golfclubs, countless
lawnchairs, and everyones luggage(a total of 5
people). the back of that vanagon was riding soo low!
i was sweatin my engine all the way down. however,
somehow it made it all 500 and some miles with no
problem. just thought i'd share. later.
