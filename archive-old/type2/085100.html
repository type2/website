Subject: Re:  Polishing Problem 

Remember that you need to get the clear coat off before polishing but once
you do that you could simply polish it with a bench top buffer and then
re-spray the clear coat. It is indeed aluminum. Brite Dip is simply a
process that was used on the aluminum to reduce manufacturing costs. In a
restoration there is no need to Brite Dip it again.

You won't get satisfactory results with a rag and a can of aluminum polish,
or anything for that matter, until you get rid of the clear coat.

Let me know how it goes as I have set of trim awaiting the same treatment.

&gt;Just a bit ago I recall reading a post to the list which described the 
&gt;beltline trim as being &quot;bright dip&quot; rather than polished aluminum.  And, I 
&gt;believe, there was a further reference to the differences in polishing this

&gt;stuff as opposed to aluminum.  Well, I have my beltline trim off the Duck 
&gt;while it's being painted.  And, of course, I am interested in making this 
&gt;stuff look good to go with the new paint job.  So...........just how does
one 
&gt;go about &quot;renewing&quot; bright dip metal trim?  Any information (but especially

&gt;info about products or refinishers to use) would be appreciated.
