Subject: Can't find a part.

Hi All, 

021119329   

That is the gasket that seals the engine tin to the top of the oil
cooler ('77 FI).  It's freakin' Unobtainum.  Either nobody has it, or
they haven't even heard of it.  

Crap!!!

That is one of the first pieces of tin that gets installed, so I'm held
up on re-assembly because of it.  And I'm seriously itching to get this
motor back into the bus.  It's been nearly 2 months now, and I'm almost
waiting as long on parts as I had to wait for the money to buy them!
Now that I finally have 99% of what I need, I can't find the freakin'
seal!!!!  

Thoughts?  

Shad H.
