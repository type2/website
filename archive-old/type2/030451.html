Volks,

This is a perfect opportunity to make an announcement that I have been
hoping to be able to make for months.  Over the last couple of months I
have draggoned George Lyle and Sean Bartnik into helping me run the list.
In addition, poor Ken Hooper has discovered that the list is like the
mob... there's only one way out :-)

I am no longer the Administrator of the list.  The post is hereby vacated.
I *am* one of the co-administrators, along with George, Ken, and Sean.  
We all have the passwords, we can all do any of the administrative
functions. There are still some scheduling and coordination issues to be
worked out, but as of now, all four of us constitute the Administrative
staff of the list.  If you hvae a problem, write to any one of us.

On the specific event that prompted this, the offending individual is
gone.  George yanked him last night.  The post in question never made it
to the digest (which may prompt some confusion on the part of digest
subscribers, don't worry you missed nothing).  The whole issue here is
keeping the list on-topic!  the subject is buses!  Not human rights, not
smoking, not bugs, not nothing bus *buses*!!!  If you wander, you will
probably get a note. If you blow right over the line, you will get banned. 


                           H Steven Dolan
			   One of the Administrators of the type2 list

&gt;     war on women ????
&gt; 
&gt;     this has bus content !!!
&gt; 
&gt;     where's the filter for this sort of mail????
&gt; 
Glen,
I could also ask you where the Bus content is in your post...

The filter didn't catch that one but co-list-admin George Lyle did and
removed the poster from the list, as I was about to do before I found out
he beat me to it.

If you have a question like Glen's above, DO NOT post it to the list, send
it to type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com, which goes directly to the list
administrators.
