Subject: [T2] Strange hesitation problem, and solution!

I was at work today, busily warp^H^H^H^Heducating young minds.  My
beautiful wife calls with the new that her bug was ill.  Yes, this is a
bug story, but it might save your bacon in a bus someday as well..

The engine idled well, but as soon as you tried to drive it it bucked like
a bronco!  Oddly enough, it was strong and smooth in reverse!  She had
just fueled up, so I thought she might have received a dollop of water
with the gas, but draining the float bowl yielded only gas.

The problem really seemed to be electrical, as the generator light came on
dimly in concert with the bronco act. I wiggled the wires around the
engine with no effect.

Finally, I lifted the big bundle where it rounds the corner around the fan
shroud.  Under the bundle were two little shiny spots indicationg that
some electrical contact was taking place.  Sure enough, the reverse side
of the wire bundle revealed two matching bare spots.  A piece of iner-tube
rubber and some additional electrical tape fixed things fine!  Now the bug
had good power in both forward and reverse!

It seemes that the engine rocks a bit up and down while running.  When you
accelerate the engine rocks down, and when you go into reverse it rocks
upward.  This motion slowly wore out the plastic jacket of the wiring
harness where it rubs on the fan shroud.  Since the engine is rocked
downward most to the time, the jacket wore out in that position.  When the
engine cut out, it lifted and broke the electrical short, which allowed
the engine to run, be pulled down, and make the connection again!

In reverse, the engine rocks the other way and therefore the wire never
shorts out and the engine runs fine!

Another bit of knowledge to file away!  Make sure that the wire harness is
well padded where it contacts the fan shroud.
