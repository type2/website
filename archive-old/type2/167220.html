Subject: we're outta here!

We are relocating to mid-Arizona (Camp Verde, Cottonwood, or Prescott 
Valley) in July. We're coming from 0 ft. sea-level, and going to 3,500 to 
5,000 ft. elevation - what can we do to prepare the '79 cali FI bus for it? 
I'm interested in joining the ABC when we arrive there, please contact me 
with info - I may have some parts to donate for the annual raffle, ...if 
not, I need to unload them here before moving.

Other goings-on: I built a rear-end tent platform for the T2, and hopefully 
I'll upload pics soon. I'm going to sew a custom canvas tent to go with it. 
For now, the bug screen from the baby play-pen fits it just perfectly.

The night before mother's day, my bus was vandalized. The driver's door 
window was busted in. Glass went everywhere - even in my baby's carseat. It 
seems someone has something against mothers - because another car with 2 
baby seats was also busted up - a lot more than my bus. Ugh - cretins. 
Luckily, nothing was stolen (like the original radio). I do need a 
replacement, but the glass is hard to find, though. I have not had time to 
search the yards, and DSL has been disabled for almost a week - including 
the phone with it lately.

Glad to be back up and running now.

Stef
'79 CA transporter
