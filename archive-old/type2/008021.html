I've recently purchased a 73 Westy and it's got a 6 inch square plate just
 forward of the upper engine
 cover inside the rear compartment.  This plate doesn't match the original
 sheet metal and when I looked through the previous owner's shop workorders
 I found where the fuel tank sender was replaced.  The quick fix is to
 locate the spot above the tank sender then carefully cut an access hole. 
 Seal the hole with another plate and silcone when done.  I don't know how
 much clearance there is between the fuel tank and the sheetmetal - perhaps
 someone else out there has actually done this repair and can advise
 further.  Regarding the steering, it sounds like worn tie rod ends or worn
 steering knuckle rod ends - either way it sounds like a quick inspection
 from a good front end alignment shop would be in order...good luck.

 &gt; I've got a 73 westy that has the tendency to make some large noises when
 &gt; steering tight corners.  Any ideas as to the cause/fix-it on this?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also...what is the procedure to check the fuel gauge.  Mine doesn't
work,
 &gt; and I understand that it is a bear (engine out) to change the sending
 &gt; unit...maybe it's the gauge itself??? wiring??
