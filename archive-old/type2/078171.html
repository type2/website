&gt;	I recently purchased a 74 Bus with no middle or back seats. (imagine

&gt;	from other vehicles and got a good safe fit. I'm thinking the Ford
&gt;	Aerostar seats might work with alittle modification.  Has anyone
&gt;done
&gt;	this.  Trying to find a VW Bus in a junk yard is impossible in my

&gt;
&gt;Aerostars, and most other modern vans, have a completely different mounting
&gt;system that uses a claw that clasps onto a bar mounted below surface level
&gt;of the floor. 

Try a seat from an older van - a Travel-all for instance. They bolt right
through the floor. But you should be able to find a proper seat.
