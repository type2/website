&gt;The male connector on my right carburetor (73 Bus) broke during the time of
the PO. They soldered the wire on, but it only works a while then the
vibration works it loose. Does anyone have a working out housing with that

that I can obtain.

If you're speaking of the thermomagnetic cutoff or the electric choke, and 
haven't gotten one before 1 May..give me a buzz..I think I have spares of 
both, in NC, that you're welcome to.
