There are 2 possibilities here. Either your gasket is sagging (or
otherwise coming off its mating surface as you mount the valve cover) or
your bale is too loose. The bale should require some force to get it on
and off. To tighten the bale stand on one end and pull up on the other
end. This will make it bend in the middle making a tighter fit.

&gt; Subject: Valve cover leaks
&gt;
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     The other day I did a routine valve adjustment on our 71 and can't
&gt; stop the drivers side valve cover from leaking.  There's no dings,
&gt; dents cracks or scratches on either the cover or the head.  Both
&gt; surfaces are clean and the cover isn't bent or twisted.  Despite using
&gt; new gasket I'm at a loss to get this to stop leaking.  I'm now
&gt; thinking that the bale, (or is it bail ? ), is the problem.  Has
&gt; anyone ever bent the bale so as to tighten it up?   If so how much and
&gt; where is best to make the bend ?
