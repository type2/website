Hey, volks. Having a won't start, will start
after jumping, but then dies when I turn on a
load (headlights) kind of problem. Replaced
battery with known good battery with no change in
symptoms. Unfortunately, my analyzer is at a
friends house and I won't be able to check the
alternator/regulator per Haynes/Bentley until
tomorrow. Suspect voltage regulator. Am I
taking the correct path?
