Subject: re: FS: '75 Westy Poptop, $5885

&gt;hmm, is this a joke? $5885? well shoot, i could get me a beautiful 
&gt;splitwindow
&gt;bus for this.do buses that need body work and all that really go for this
&gt;much out west? and the appliances may not work?
&gt;
&gt;maybe i could start a business shipping buses from the southeast out west...

hey, jonathan, thanks for all your sarcasm. actually, i could probably 
get $7000 for it if i had the time to wait around. let's see: the new 
engine was $3500, the brakes $800, the oil cooler, $300 the tires $150, 
the kenwood system $600. that's $5350 right there, assuming that the rest 
of the vehicle has no value. i never gave it any thought, but i suppose 
these vans are in much greater demand out here. they are EXTREMELY 
popular all along the west coast: SF, Boulder, Santa Cruz, Seattle... 
anyway, if you don't think it's worth as much as i'm asking thats fine, 
but i really don't see any reason to be insulting.
