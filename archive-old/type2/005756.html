&gt; &gt;Something else we haven't considered here: do we have 10 amps to spare in
&gt; &gt;the system?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; !0 amps should be sufficient to run a fire hose.  My 360 gph draws less
than
&gt; 2.


Before I get another couple dozen &quot;my electric water pump only draws 2 amps&quot;
pmails, let me state that
1. my comments were intended as tutorial and I chose the 10 amp value since
it was easy to multiply by 12 and should be large enough to cover even the
fire hose pumper.
2. The resultant horsepower drain by the electric pump was small enough that
it should only be an issue for only the most fanatical of those trying to
squeeze the very last fractional HP out of an engine.  By using the 10 amp
value that fact should have been obvious.
3. The whole thing started with a comment along the lines of &quot;why put a
mechanical pump on the motor, it will load the motor, put an electrical one
instead&quot;
4. I was just trying to provide some numbers that one could get their arms
around and see that electric pumps are &quot;no free lunch&quot; (as one listee so
aptly phrased it)

At least most of the comments to me were done off list, sparing the list of
all the traffic, but no one sees that I'm getting hit over here.

Through all this I think the original posters question got lost in all the
fog.

Here's my thoughts on that.

Water serves as a mechanism to transfer the heat from one place to another.
You still need a radiator to get rid of that heat.
Radiators rely on air flow for their heat exchange.
Now you have a heat exchanger with water and oil for the oil to water
transfer
and another heat exchanger for the water to air transfer
add to that oil lines, water lines, thermostatically controlled fan to blow
(or suck) air across the water radiator
and don't forget that pump (be it electric or manual) to move the water.

Wouldn't it be easier to just add an external oil cooler ($159) with a fan?

Finally, I would like to state, that I did NOT receive a single message with
any ill will towards me, just a huge batch of pmails all saying the same
thing.  I just wanted to clear up a few things and redirect the topic back
to the original question.

All suited up in Nomex
Peace :-))
