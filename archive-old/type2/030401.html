Subject: '77-78 FI wiring harness needed

Volk,

I have just spent a couple frustrating hours trying to diagnose an
electrical problem that is keeping my bus grounded (I think this may be
both literally and figuatively true :).  I have not yet found the fault,
but I will.  The *real* problem tho is age.  The wiring harness is very
stiff and I think it is cracking and failing internally.  If anyone has:
(a) a good used or 
(b) a sourse for repro
wiring harnesses for the FI system for a '77/78 bus, please let me know.
