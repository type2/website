Subject: RE: [T2] sliding metal sunroofs to fit 1968-1972 VW    

I got a new set of cables for my sunroof from
wolfsburg, and feel lucky to get em. they only had ONE
right one left and several lefts......I have a
questions about those......they are felt like cables
wrapped in a think wire for the crank to move the
slide.......should you use any type of lubricant for
these or it that what the felt stuff is for?

Rus 71 bus in Bartlesville OK
