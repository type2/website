Subject: RE: [T2] How do I tell if it is the battery or alternator?

Measure the bus voltage (pun intended) at the cigarette lighter. Then start
the engine (jump it, whatever) and measure the voltage at the same location.
The voltage should be higher (like around 14) with the engine running (if
not, try revving to about 2000 rpm). If there is no increase, or a voltage
drop with the engine on, then the alternator or voltage regulator are
suspect.

I assume your bus is new enough to have an alternator instead of a
generator.

ok,
so i have been jumped twice today.
2 different batteries.
neither would start up after I shut it off after being jumped. The first
time I let the bus run for 25 minutes. The second time I let it run for an
hour 20 minutes.
now I put a 3rd battery in there (it is not fully charged, it only had like
11.5 volts when I put it in) My lights work, but it doesn't start. I know
that 12.6 is fully charged and 12.15 is only 25%.
How do I tell if it is the battery or the alternator?
please help
Thanks,
Kyle
