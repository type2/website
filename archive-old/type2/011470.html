Hey there Wes,

Most part catalogs list parts by the chassis number. This can be
found on your VIN plate which sould be on the dash (and front door
jamb, and engine compartment). Looks like the example below.

#234 2164 060 
 ||| ||__ this is the number to check (Chassis number=164 060)
 ||| |___ this is always a 2 on buses
 |||_____ last digit for model year (1974)
 ||______ model # (3 is for a kombi, or bus converted by westy) 
 |_______ always 2 for type2

The brake parts should be listed as &quot;to chassis number&quot; and &quot;from
chassis number&quot;.

For all you need to know about m-codes goto Vincent's page:

http://www.type2_dot_com/m-codes/

From this info you can find out what day your bus was born.

HTH,
