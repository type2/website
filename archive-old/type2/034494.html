Subject: Happy New Year, Bus Content and Dan Sinclair

First things first... HAPPY NEW YEAR. I had to work so couldn't get to the
site until now.

As I report just before Christmans some _at_hole broke my passenger wing window
to get at my stereo. The stereo was hardly worth anything. The guy destroyed
my dash though. I had cut it out in the early 80's for a DIN mount so it
wasn't like it had vintage value or anything but it did still look nice.
Well that's history and I'll be looking for a dash now. Has anyone replaced
a dash in a late 70's bus? What kind of personal hell am I in for? Is it
even possible or is my bus now trash?

The really INCREDIBLE thing... DAN SINCLAIR - thank you - thank you - thank
you!!! Dan sent me a passenger wing out of a 74 he parted out a while ago.
He asked nothing for it in return although I offered. Three days after
Christmas a BIG box arrived and in it was the wing window. WOW! The Karma
thing goes around and around. I make this offer to anyone out there in NEED.
I have a new (I think) flywheel for a manual transaxle. When I bought my
stage I MSHP the guys sent me an unlightened flywheel for the Type IV. Since
my transaxle is an automatic this is of little use to me. If anyone needs
this I will send it to them on me (State-side only please).
