&gt;I have also wondered why the alternator wire goes to the starter rather 
&gt;than the battery. The theory I have is that because the engine moves 
&gt;relative to the battery any wires that go between them will flex. This is 
&gt;more of a problem for thicker wires as they are less flexible. The VW 
&gt;engineers had no choice with locating the battery to starter wire, but they 
&gt;did with the alternator wire - hence it goes to the starter, not the battery.

My theory is that the engine design originated with the beetle which had the battery under the back seat. It was more cost effective to run the battery to the starter with a short cable.
