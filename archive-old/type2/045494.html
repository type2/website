Subject: RE: [T2] left or right brake caliper?

Having just replaced both sides on our 82 Westy, I know that the mounting
holes are different sizes top and bottom.  As to which is which.......well,
um.......I believe that the bigger hole is on the top, using a shouldered
bolt.  It's not much bigger and the threads are the same, but the bolt that
fits through the top hole will not fit the through the bottom (I think).

Hope this helps.

How can you tell the difference between a left and right 1973 to 1983
 brake caliper?  Pistons are still in place, but no pads.  Thanks, Joel
