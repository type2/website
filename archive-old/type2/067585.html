I think you will find this part quite easily as its not a Champagne Edition 
part nor a Westfalia part.

It would, I think, be fitted to any 'loaf-bus' that had a floor covering 
(eg. Kombi, mini-bus, delux mini-bus, ambulance etc).

Although a 'useful' part I'm mystified as to why your PO kept it - unless he's
converting panel vans to campers.
