Subject: 63 westy in wait until dark

Hi youse alls.

Just came back a bit ago from the Oly Food Coop working members party at the
capitol theatre downtown.   Food and flicks, some vintage shorts, and the
main show was Wait Until Dark, with Audrey Hepburn, I think.  It was made
circa 1965.   A 63 Flip Top westy figures in the film, as the bad guys
hangout.   Lots of shots of the outside of the bus, and one scene inside.
 Can you guess why I say 63?    It also had the roof brackets for the tent,
with the front bumper bracket, just like Nellie, my 65 westy.   It was either
dove blue or turquiose, the colour in the flick wasn't all that clear.  

It was decribed in the movie as a 'squat truck thing'
