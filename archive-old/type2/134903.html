Subject: Re: [T2] Jacking '77 bay

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; If you have a spare you can do it yourself with the emergency jack.

I have a spare, just not the jack.  I've got the old scissors jack from my
last car for now.  I really need to get one of those BD jacks.

&gt; Sounds like a big shop with fancy equipment!

Imagine a used tire shop in Georgia...

Yeah, it's one of those.  But they're nice folk and will change tires around
for $5.00 a tire.  I've been getting tires from them for over a decade for
my old cars.  I won't be getting tires from them for the bus, though.

&gt; If you look at the frame you'll see places to put the jack in the middle
but it's not that safe if you ask me.

By &quot;safe&quot; I meant for the bus.  I should have been more specific.  They'll
want to take both tires off to change the rims over.  I just didn't want to
damage the bus.

&gt; VW says to support the bus here:

Looks like the center of the front beam is the place.

Thanks.
