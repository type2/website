Subject: Re: [T2]  Front seat redo in a '71 westy
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 10:52:35 -0500




&gt; I've spent some time in the archives and library, but was wondering if
anyone
&gt; knew of a resource where I could find out what's involved in restoring my
two
&gt; little front seats.

Don,  I had never done it before, but I recovered the front buckets on my
'70.  You will need the seat covers, complete, seat pads (I used foam, but
the purists like the original horsehair), and a set of hog rings and pliers.
Do one seat at a time so you don't forget how it's supposed to fit.  It
takes patience and time, but it's really not that hard.
