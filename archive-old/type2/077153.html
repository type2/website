Subject: Re: [T2] Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

Howdy,
I replaced my stock 78 front seats with early 80s vanagon seats. The vanagon
seats are more comfortable and have superior innards, at least with regard to
durability/longevity.
Regards,
Chris

&gt; Guys, not having been in a vanagon lately, why would
&gt; I want a seat out of one of them to go in to my 78?
&gt;
&gt; There must be something I am missing here....
&gt; Are they really made that much better than the stock seat?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt; &quot;What did they cost you? &quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At a local pull-a-part any seat is $25 each.  This weekend they had two nice
&gt; &gt; sets of Vanagon seats up for grabs one navy blue and the other maroon, also
&gt; &gt; a few middle and rear bench seats in Maroon cloth.  No baywindow stuff
&gt; &gt; though.  This is at the Atlanta location of pull-a-part.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I imagine the other bone yards would have similar prices.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also from all the feedback to the original question is that '76 and newer
&gt; &gt; can use the Vanagon seats directly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Happy Journeys,
