Subject: Stripped hex nut

Hello Volks,
I was able to get out the hex bolt that held my CV joint which I stripped
out last week.  A good hammering in and a vice grip for added torque was all
I needed. Whheeeww!  This weekend I will hopefully be dropping the motor and
tranny of my 83' Vantage that I pulled out of the junkyard.  It's going
slow, but I sure am learning a lot.  Thanks everyone for the advice.  I'm
not a true mechanic by anymeans so I love all the help that I am getting
from everyone out in Type2 land.  Thanks again and I'll keep you posted on
my progress with the van.
