&gt; &gt;I wanted to remove the Fuel Tank filter screen and see how much crap was in
&gt; &gt;it, does anyone have a picture/diagram/description I could use, I can't seem
&gt; &gt;to find it in any of my books
&gt; 
&gt; It comes out with that fitting on the bottom of the tank. It's a long worm
&gt; made of mesh. The mesh is about like that net you use to catch the goldfish
&gt; out of the tank but it's made of some indestructible material. Just wiggle
&gt; it out of there.


Ken is absolutley right *if* you have a carb engine.  On the FI tanks,
tho, there is no such filter.  The two taps are (at least in my '78 tank)
welded in place.  If you have FI and see no threaded fitting, then you
gotta pull the tank to clean it as there is no filter in the tank.
