Subject: Re: wanted: gas BA6 heater

&gt;I am looking desperately for an Eberspacher BA-6 to install in my Westy. I
&gt;would truly appreciate it if any listmembers have a lead on one.


I have a BRAND NEW one that , although it does not contain everything you'll
need to install &quot;from scratch.&quot;  I suppose you'll want to get a used one (or
a used BA4) to rob parts off of to make this complete.  However, this may be
the only brand new BA6 in existence, and at $350 I'm asking about 1/3 of the
original new price.

Nearest I can tell, this is the main unit with everything that bolts
directly to it (glow plug, points system, etc. etc.).  That is, there are no
unused holes in the unit other than the air inlet and the outlet.  The
wiring harness is also included.  Not included are parts that VW apparantly
did not consider &quot;part of&quot; the gas heater iteslf.  This includes underdash
relays, fuel pump, dash mounted thermostat controller, hot air blower
(basically a simple electric fan) or temp sensor that mounts in the heater
duct near the cab area(although the piece of duct that it mounts into is
included).  This is why you'll want to find a bus or Type 4 in a junkyard to
get ancilliary parts from, since these parts are either unavailable or quite
expensive new.
