Subject: Re: how many miles on your bus

&gt;
&gt;&gt; John Grunkemeier &lt;grunke_at_U.WASHINGTON.EDU&gt; asks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How many miles are on the other buses out there?  Who's got the record?

 Just to show that I still have a few active brain cells, this 
question has come up before.

 I recall a couple who are doing the &quot;world tour&quot; thing and had over
2.5 million of their own.

 It was quoted on some tv show that the &quot;average&quot; beetle has over
1.5 million miles.

 Sounds like I have a ways to go yet. I don't count and the Ole girl
don't say.
 Blew a Porsche away today on the way to FLAPS.

 It was the &quot;age and treachery&quot; thing against &quot;youth and big bucks&quot;.
