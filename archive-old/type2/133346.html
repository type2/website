Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

&gt; Well---quite the week--and I'm glad it's over with.
&gt;
&gt; I tried the miracle in a can and here are my observations.
&gt; ( for those of you who missed the initial post---I was prepping a Daewoo
&gt; rubber tired end loader for paint.)
&gt;
&gt; First thing is that this stuff is a bear to work with.
&gt;
&gt; After the elongated cure time of 90 some hours it is like sanding
&gt; crystal prior to paint--it hate sanding--and this stuff stinks.
&gt; The stuff is as hard as a rock.
&gt; It made the job that much more miserable, and time consuming--the
&gt; overall cure time is ridiculous.
&gt;
&gt; Second, --hey--after you sand blast, wire wheel, or sand off the
&gt; rust---how in the heck does the pot holes get filled?

the truth, how do you &quot;really&quot; feel about the stuff.....&lt;g&gt;

&gt; If a guy has a bunch of time--and doesn't care what the end result
&gt; is--go for the POR product--it'll take twice as long to get the job
&gt; done, and the results aren't going to be as nice as using accepted
&gt; automotive refinishing preparation products.

what about using it as a really tough underbody coating where you don't
care about appearences and &quot;tough&quot; is the real goal

&gt; The only area's that came out looking good is where I buried the
&gt; converter with urethane bed liner--like on top of the front fender's,
&gt; and the floor of the cab--it hid all the pot holes well--and looks good.

well at least it worked for you somewhere   &lt;g&gt;

&gt; At least I tried the alleged best way to get rust work done--and found
&gt; it to be tedious, time consuming, and not worth the time and effort for
&gt; at best, just an OK job.

but the question is, how well does it stop rust, keep an eye on that part
too if you can. may not look good but you used it on a tough beast and
could be a good test of the rust prevention part of it.... (hey it is a
lot cheaper than the vari prime etc, and for underbody work it could have
a low cost use....
