Folks,
I woke up this morning to the sounds of a 2 litre VW turning around in my driveway. My mechanic has delivered it to me and I have, since then, completed all the legal requirements for this country to be road registered and legal. Some of the saga to date has been detailed below in my home page, the rest will follow, with more pictures, soon.
 
I wish all of you a wonderful Christmas and hope your New Year will be as wonderful as I know mine will.
 
John
