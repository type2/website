Wow....still interested? 
        
         I know am not much of a writer, but I like to keep a little diary
of what I have done V-dub-wise over the years.  You can see it at
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/  .  I keep sending
emails to OFF-ROAD_dot_com and a lot of the VWBUS sites for links but either
they hate my site or else buggy folks dont like bus folks or
vice-versa....oh well...

Back to the story.....
        
        So....George and I are sitting at a park bench doing the &quot;stinky
and coffee thing&quot; around 9am when the third point to our &quot;bus pulling
buggy&quot;  triangle shows up.  He had to disect his buggy the week before to
get his frame welded up properly and decided to go ahead and have his frame
sand blasted for new paint.  Well...the guy shooting the sand had a heart
attack or a seizure or something either during or just after and left his
frame rather pockey.  Needless to say, his buggy wasnt ready so he ended up
borrowing a buddy's wife's buggy.......ooooooowww   yuuuuuuck!  Purple and
yellow...yep  but a real nice looking buggy.  George grabbed another coffee
refill and we chased after our buddy.

        I see a split going on in our group.  We have dirt bikes, quads,
and buggies in our group of about 25.  In the day time, the bikes and quads
are together and at night, the bikes have to stay in.   This weekend we
were split up because half the group wanted to camp in the
electricity......one guy brought a 5th wheel....and the other half wanted
to &quot;rough it&quot; in the non-electricity.  I opted the non-electric route which
meant moving and setting up camp in the sand under tree cover rather than
on the  pavement.  This is always hard for me as friends always get their
feelings hurt if you dont camp with them.   It is nothing personal...   I
just  recently convinced myself you have got to do what makes you happy and
not worry about everyone else so much.  So...I camped in the rough.
        
        After getting camp &quot;semi&quot; set up, I had a flat rear paddle tire to
contend with.  Apparently, no tire places carry large  inner tubes anymore
so I had to settle for an &quot;implement tire tube&quot; (whatever that is....I AM
not a farmer despite the fact I live in OK) before I left home.  This type
of tube has a much larger valve stem and requires you drill out the hole in
your rim a little.  I drilled out the hole and filed the edges smooth but I
guess I missed some aluminum shavings...live and learn....which caused the
tube to go flat on the trip out.  Following about a 3 hour battle with the
tube and a patch, I unloaded my buggy.

        Our first trip out on the dunes wasnt what I had expected. 
Yea....my rail was running smooth..really smooth....but....wide-open.....it
was falling on its face hard.  WTF?  Oh no.  Were the carbs delivering too
much gas?  I wasnt blowing black smoke.  Hmmmmmm....  George broke his whip
(a fiberglass mast with a bright colored flag on the top of it to warn
others of your location is you are coming up a steep hill.....smart guys
have steel ones...ha...ha) and no one had tools to fix it on the spot, so I
used this excuse to go back to camp with him and do some more tuning before
I really embarassed myself.  I had been popping off about how good my carbs
were set up and how I would have THE best running buggy out there this
weekend......not.

        George and I checked everything.  We started with the dizzy.  I HAD
reset my timing and valves the day before but that was all since the day
Rob (Bus buddy - chemist) put the &quot;golden touch&quot; on my carbs.  We replaced
points.  We sprayed the 009 with WD.  We tried statically timing the dizzy
but ended up feeling much more confused about dizzies as ever.  Statically,
at 8 degrees BTDC, the engine wouldnt start.  Usually, I just use a timing
light and set at 32degrees max advance at about 2k rpms.  As usual, some
guy walks up and says......&quot;Yeah, my expert builder says set em at 50
degrees at idle&quot;.....yeah right!  We set the dizzy back to the same
position it was at (visually) before we started mooking with it.  It starts
smooth....idles smooth....accelerates smooth.....but has a &quot;blaaaahhhhht&quot;  
sound at the top....like it had a cold.   I just knew the dizzy wasnt
advancing.  

        Ham (Chad)  comes back to camp and jumps out of his
&quot;borrowed-wifey-mobile&quot;.  &quot;What's up?&quot;, he says.  We told him and he, being
a very KISS type person, says, &quot;Check the plugs.......they are probably
fouled&quot;.  I remember the quad days where a new plug fixed everything that
ails you and go, &quot;yea right....&quot;.  To sum up the last couple paragraphs,
new plugs were the ticket.  Of course, George and I wouldnt let Ham have
the satisfaction.....we told him it was the timing.......  Just as I had
shot my mouth off...my buggy was running the BEST it ever has.  Thanks
again Rob, George, and...uh hum....Chad.

        The weather had warmed up a bit (mid-70's) and it looked like the
overcast skies would have the clouds burnt out of them by the sun but it
never did.  We went out and played on the big dunes for awhile.  George and
I found a cool little sand mound that we took turns wheelieing over.  A
Jeep pulled up a little close to see what was going on and I accidentally
&quot;grazed&quot; his bumper while in a wheelie.  It scared the crap out of the
newbies in the Jeep but nothing was hurt.  A little later, George, in his
everlasting endeavor to flip a buggy over backwards (???), dug his tires
down in on this mound while in a wheelie and end up stuck up in the air.  I
quickly ran over and pulled him back down though he wasnt in any danger of
going over backwards....he had already done his best to roll with the tires
spinning.  Later....he commented, &quot;I wonder how I would've got down if I
were out riding by myself&quot;.   &quot;Hmmm......&quot;, I thought to myself, &quot;I dont
know..&quot;.

        Back at camp.....we snacked and grabbed a couple brews.  Though it
was still early, daylight was dwindling under the still overcast sky. I dug
a fire pit and put together a little tee pee of logs in preparation for sun
down.   A breeze picked up and dropped a light mist on us.   Luckily, this
mist turned to a thick fog as the temperature rose gradually thru the
night.

        We went out again for a large group ride just after sun down.  I
cringe at these types of rides anymore.  Everyone waits an hour to get
everyone in one big line and it takes about 15 minutes for people to get
irritated at how slow the leader is going and breaks off from the group or
else the leader leaves everyone behind.  Regardless, the train dissolves
very quickly.   There was some excitement on this ride as my wife burnt her
bare butt on my hot EXHAUST PIPE! while trying to warm up and pee at the
same time.   Ouch.....it looks like it REALLY hurts.

        We went back to camp again and the boys on the dirt bikes had
already started the fire.  We sat around the fire and did some more tuning
up of a different nature until everyone started to go to bed.  This is MY
favorite part.  This is where the hard core SERIOUS duners get to ride
together.  Unfortunately, this time, it boiled down to only George and I. 
Dont get me wrong, there is no one else I enjoy riding with more than my
buddy George.  Its just more fun when you got some &quot;spode&quot; that is new to
buggies and you show em places and do things they have never seen before. 
Well,  we happened accross a pair of em not long after.  These guys were
really nice though a little &quot;smokey&quot; if you know what I mean....  The four
of us rode into a really thick tree covered area and George finally did
it........he finally flipped his buggy.   I am still not for sure
how.....but I heard him laughing.....   He wasnt hurt but I think he said
his exhaust pipes may have been damaged a little....nothing serious.

        Again, George and I went back to camp with the intent to go back
out.  We shot the breeze for awhile but got a little too comfy and agreed
to call it a night.

        I woke up the next day (late) to find everyone packed up and gone
pretty much.  The sun was shining very bright and it was almost warm.  I
talked Craig into pulling my trailer as I didnt feel like messing with my
hitch.  The wind was blowing so hard, it would have been pure hell with the
trailer back there.  A couple aspirins and some of that gas station pizza
and we were set for the road home.   

        I still havent cleaned the smoke smell and hundred pounds of sand
out of the bus yet.  But...nothing broke......and the buggy is still loaded
up in case we wanna go this weekend.   Anyone?
