the same shop did all the work and they did not charge me for today's 
fix.  I knew it was their problem all along and they fixed it, no questions 
asked.   It was a bad ball joint.

&gt;&gt;Was the ball joint bad, or just installed incorrectly.  The direction of
&gt;&gt;the joint as it is pressed in is important to allow the suspension to
&gt;&gt;work.  If it's wrong, it'll bind.

&gt;There is a possibility that you were charged for a defective part, and it 
&gt;was improper installation.  Did the same shop do all of the work?  Did you 
&gt;keep the 'bad' parts(in this case the balljoint)?  Check the part yourself 
&gt;and see if George's theory was correct.  If this is the case, you may be 
&gt;deserving a refund.
