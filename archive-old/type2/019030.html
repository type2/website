what about the sliding vynil thinggy? could u rig that on to a 75'
roof?  winter would be cold however with only vynil between u and the
outside, but in canada they salt the roads so i don't ever see me
driveing in the winter anyways.

Spunky,

I fear the answer is no :-(  The '68-72 Westies were built on sunroof
bodies, and sunroofs can be installed, but the '74-79 poptop had a much
larger cutout, and will not take a sunroof unless you want to cut the
whole roof off your bus and transplant an entire sunroof roof... a
*major*
undertaking!
