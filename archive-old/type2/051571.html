Subject: [T2] Likely my last post regarding the Kristin Laurite murder, America 	s Most Wanted

Howdy Volks,

I have been VERY busy last 10 days, but some things require that I make
time.

America's Most wanted filmed in Arkansas yesterday to hopefully air at the
end of this month. Check your local TV listings. I made copies of the news
stories:

There is now an OFFICIAL site for Kristin Laurite:

  http://www.KristinLaurite_dot_org/

So sometimes soon (30 days?) I will likely end updates to my YourVW_dot_com
site.  I will keep the page up indefinitely, but I won't be putting latest
news on... just a link to the official site.  My site served the purpose of
keeping list traffic on the topic within reason and it helped organize
things in the early months of this case.  That time has passed.

Kristin's birthday would have been January 28th.
