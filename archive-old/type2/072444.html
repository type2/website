I am trying to find some one in the charlotte NC with a hydraulic press, who can press out ball joints.  Does any one know of anywhere?  I have tried every trick in the book, and I can't get these to budge.  Every one has said that getting them pressed out and the new ones pressed in is the only way to go.  I just can't find anywhere that has one.  I am open to suggestions, and repair place recommendations.  Any help is appreciated greatly!!!  Thanks!!!
