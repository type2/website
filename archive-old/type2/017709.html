Chuck,
The 1700's did not come stock with hydraulic lifters (not in a type 2, anyway).
Does it come with all the tin, alternator, carbs, dizzy, exhaust, and heater boxes?
What kind of shape is all this stuff in? Is it original, or after market stuff?
IMHO, $400 for a complete turn key rebuildable core would be a good price if you
need all the ancillary stuff. A pair of new heater boxes alone would set you back
that much.
Without all the extras, I'd have to say $400 is OK if you know the guy really well,
provided it runs good, compression is good, and there are no unusual noises.

&gt; Dear List-
&gt;         Does anybody know if a 1700 CC engine came with hydrolic lifters?  Also
&gt; Is $400 a good deal for a complete turn key engine with 34,000 miles on
&gt; it?
