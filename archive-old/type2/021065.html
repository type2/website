Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance info. needed

Howdy.  FWIW, I wanted to pass on a little story of an amigo here in
Portland OR who's got the same year Westy as me ('74), except his is
registered as a motorhome and mine isn't (our vans are identical). 
Seems that the registration costs more as a motorhome than a van, and in
addition the city of Portland doesn't give out resident permit parking
stickers to motorhomes.  And he couldn't re-register it as a van (once a
motorhome always a motorhome?)...

&gt; We've owned a '78 Westfalia for a week now, and we're new to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; We found out that it's cheaper to insure our bus with our State Farm
&gt; agent if it's registered as a motor home.  The way that they come up
&gt; with a premium is based on the price of the vehicle when it was
&gt; purchased new.  Our vehicle does not show up in their files.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know or know how to find out what a '78 campmobile cost when
&gt; it was new?
