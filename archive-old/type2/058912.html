Yes, they can burn up, provided they're in the right position.  I just had
a car stereo installed in my 71 so that it would have constant power,
regardless of the position of the ignition switch.  This was to prevent me
having to turn the ignition switch on to run the stereo, risking the
burning out of my points.

Basically, if the points are at a certain point on the lobe when the
engine cuts off, causing them to be closed, they can either fuse closed or
the constant arcing can burn them up, as I understand it.

 &gt; Is replacing the points a tough thing to do?

Not at all.  A bit tedious, but not difficult.  Consult either Muir,
Bentley, or Haynes for complete procedure.  Muir is quite good at
explaning this.
