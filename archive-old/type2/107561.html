Subject: Re: [T2] EGR question

If the input to the EGR valve is properly sealed off then leaving it in
place isn't affecting a thing.  If the &quot;pinched off&quot; spot is leaking then
the EGR valve - off idle and before WOT - is a source for a vacuum leak.
Check to see that the pinched off spot isn't leaking and, if it isn't, leave
things alone.

Subject: [T2] EGR question


&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; I was just curious about something with my EGR unit. It is currently
pinched
&gt; off and sealed just on the under side of the tin since the PO replaced the
&gt; stock exhaust system with an extractor system. I do not plan to replace
the
&gt; filter untill I need a new muffler. The EGR is the mechanical type and the
rod
&gt; that connects to the throttle body is still there and functions as it
should
&gt; when the throttle is moved. What I'm wondering is if I should remove that
rod
&gt; for now untill I replace the EGR filter at a later time? Does it
contribute
&gt; good, bad or not at all to the way the bus runs since there is nothing
hooked
