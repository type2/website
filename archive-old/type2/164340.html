Subject: 78 bus rear torsion problems

     Been working on the rear torsion bars of my '78 bus the last couple days,
and am about to burn the thing to the ground. Once I re-indexed the bars, had
a terrible time getting the spring plate back on with a new bushing behind it.
New bushings are a bit larger and much stiffer than stock. Finally got the
spring plate on far enough to sit on the stop, figured i would pull it down
the rest of the way with the spring plate cover. When I put a bushing (old or
new) on the outside of the spring plate, it causes the cover to sit about 3/8&quot;
too high, and I can't get the bolts in. (Even longer ones) If I pull it back
off and relieve the torsion bar pressure, I can move the spring plate end
around all I want, and get the cover on just fine. Even with the cover
tightened down, however, I can't get the spring plate back onto the splines
far enough to sit on the stop. So I can either have the plate on the stop
(which takes some HARD driving with a BFH) or I can have the spring plate
cover on, but not both. What am I missing here?

Thanks,
