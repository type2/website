Subject: RE: [T2] High Temp Powder Coating

Courtney and stan(and others),

The hi temp stuff has worked very well for me. 

I coated my new heater boxes(manifolds and boxes) with the hi-temp stuff 
from Eastwood and so far as I can tell it still looks like the day I put 
it on....admittedly, I have only about 1700 miles on my engine, but the last 
time I looked, the coating next to the heads looked just like the day I 
got it out of the oven.

The bus has been on an 8 hour round trip on the interstate at 75mph+
and I specifically looked when I got home to see what it looked like.

I agree with Stan that it is no substitute for his ceramachrome and hot 
jet type coatings, but the hi-temp powder  has done well for me.

You can partially see the heater boxes here

Cheers, dave

&gt; That would not be powdercoating, that would be ceramic coating which handles
