OK I have 
An AVP engine that has a little over 1000 miles on it
Valves adjusted at 1000 miles
checked my timing and it is fine - 5 after TDC and advance around 43 with
hoses attached

Drove about 30 miles last weekend in upper 70's weather and had a temp of
aprox. 230 - needle on zero of 220. Oil pressure was upper 30s at 68 mph and
rpms were 3.2. The drive home was a temp of 210 with an ambient temp of
upper 50's-60 and pressure of 38 or so.

Temp problems are probably oil flow or air flow. The oil pressure and lower
running temp in cooler weather makes me think that I have an air flow
problem.

The side vents are not clogged. A new seal was installed with the rebuild.
No thermostat so the flaps should be wide open.

Oh yeah the oil temp is from a sensor in the non-strainer sump plate. Could
the temp gauge be wrong????

I also do not have the tubes from the heat exchangers to the heat tubes
going to the front of the bus hooked up - does this make a difference??? I
thought not??????

Any Ideas???????

Second I may have a opportunity to buy a 78 westy. I know that the trany
changed from 78 to 79 (my current bus) can the 78 trany be used in the 79?
