Subject: Re: [T2] I'm REALLY frustrated.


&gt;I'm at my ends wits right now.  Here's the scenario.  My '71 ( AK engine ) 
&gt;ran like crap five months ago.  I couldn't adjust #3 valve so I let it 
&gt;sit.  I replaced the heads, spark plugs, ignition, set the timing (009 at 
&gt;7.5 BTDC statically).  It won't idle.  I noticed a crack in the vacuum 
&gt;hose to the brake booster so I replaced it.  How do I check if I have a 
&gt;vacuum leak else where?  I believe its the carb.  I check the idle air 
&gt;screw (big one) and it's two turns out.  What else can I do.  My family 
&gt;are suppose to go camping today  but....  Thanks in advance.

Set the timing with a gun. check the idle speed with a tach. Check the 
dwell with the dwell meter.

What do you mean you couldn't adjust the #3 valve? Exhaust or Intake? 
Couldn't reach it? Adjustment was different everytime you ran it or???

If that valve is too tight it may not close completely and this will cause 
the idle to be rough.

Is it missing on one cylinder or randomly? Pull each spark plug lead while 
the engine runs and see which cylinder isn't performing. Is it #3?

Check compression.

Use WD-40 or carb cleaner to spray every potential leaking gasket while the 
engine idles until it smooths out, slows down, or speeds up. Once you've 
found a leak each squirt should cause a change in the idle quality.

Is the carb clean? Do the idle air screws make a difference in the engine 
speed or idle quality?

Check the idle jets and see if they aren't clean.

Muir has a pretty good beginner's procedure if you have never done this.
