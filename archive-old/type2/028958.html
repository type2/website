Subject: [T2] 79' heat riser tube


Great and powerful list,

I am looking for the right heat riser tube that connects the fan to the heat
exchanger. This varmit is a metal tube that is round on the bottom where it
connects to the heat exchanger but oblong on top where it connects to the
hose to the fan. apparently they made this different along with a lot of
things on 79's only. If any one has a lead on one please let me know. Thanks
in advance....Dana
