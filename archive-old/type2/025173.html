X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&lt;&lt;I have just started to experience a clanking noise coming from the back of
the van - it is only present when the van is moving and gets faster as the
van gets faster - I cannot see anything visually wrong wither under the van
or around the wheels or in the engine.&gt;&gt;

Boys and Girls,
	This might be something as simple as a road parasite wrapped around
your driveshaft!  Pull that sucker off.  If not, it might be within the
brake drum itself(something might have come loose).  Whatever it is, it's
related to vehicle speed, not engine RPM, is this correct?
