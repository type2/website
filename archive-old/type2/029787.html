The axle is designed to slide.  It has to move in and out to allow for the
different distance from transmission to wheel as teh suspension moves.  It
is limited by the CV joints.

&gt; I am in the middle of doing my rear brakes and CV's and I noticed that my
&gt; right axle moves in and out freely while my left axle has only millimeters
&gt; of play. What is the mechanism to keep the axle from sliding in and out
&gt; (besides having the wheel attached) ?
