&gt;    71 Dormobile with a 71 bug engine. My question is why when I stomp

&gt; cylinder, (no vacuum here) and all hoses that run to the booster.  I
&gt; have checked and rechecked the check valve in the engine and no
&gt; problems. Could I have a torn diaphragm? Brakes work great now and I
&gt; can't here any hissing. Maybe a hose is collapsing onto itself? I have
&gt; one rubber hose underneath, but all rest are the fabric coated type.


Paul,

It *sounds* liek the booster diaphram, but it may not be.  Earlier today
cfaen posted about Actron tools on sale.  One of these tools will help you
immeasurably...

Vacuum/Pressure Tester - Sale price $9.99   [orig. $24.99]
http://www.actron_dot_com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=cp7802.htm&amp;cart_id=6100463_16801

This *is* the instrument you need!!!!!  It will tell you exactly waht is
happening.  If you happen to own one already, hook it up to the vacuum
retard port on the carb or T it into the booster line (FLAPS sell
appropriately sized Ts)  Start the bus, have someone step on the brakes
while you watch the gauge.  If it dips and stays down while you have your
foot on the brakes, then your booster is bad.  If it dips and comes right
back or does not dip, then your booster is fine.
