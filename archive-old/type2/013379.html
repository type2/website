my $0.02:

Muir wrote a great, empowering book.

Muir lived in a different time where priorities were different.

Muir was working on cars that were ~5-10 years old.  We're working on
cars that are 20-33 years old.  Different parts are available (or not 
available),
certain realizations have come to light with longer test times, etc.

Summary:

Muir's book tells you the basics on how to keep your VW alive.  It's a 
great
confidence builder, field manual, bible to help you smile when you're 
down,
and reference for how to fix your car.  There are things in HtKYVW Alive 
that are
Muir's opinion -- like the 009 and the choke.  I think that he clearly 
states
when things are his opinion as opposed to when they are fact.

His book is by no means comprehensive, but it covers 80% of the problems
out there.  The list is the group mind and covers far more than any one
(or ten) man could put together in a lifetime.  Remember, that until 
very recently
there was no type-2 site and nowhere for people to share/hash-out 
experiences
like the wonderful forum we have now, courtesy of that wonderful tool:  
the internet.

Your only chance to share war stories was meeting a fellow VW'er on the 
road
or talking to your local mechanic.

Man, am I glad that I had a &quot;Poor Richard's How to keep your Volkswagon 
Rabbit Alive&quot;
book when I was in high school.  Did it ever make life with my '79 (?) 
rabbit easier.
I had no internet, couldn't tell my dad that I bent the axle and needed 
to get it
swapped out.  Same thing when folks like my dad needed to pull the 
engine from
our '71 beetle when he was in grad school and had no bread to get it 
done.  A weekend,
two strong brothers and a '68-71, spiral-bound copy or muir got a burnt 
valve fixed
over a weekend -- much to my mother's chagrin when she came home to find
a 1600DP sitting in the middle of the living room.

Anyway, I think Muir is a close approximation of how to keep a VW on the 
road and alive.
It might not be precise -- maybe a vacuum advance dizzy is better than a 
009 and *is*
easier on your engine -- but it'll get your 90% of the way there and 
dollars to donuts
will get you by until you can do more research on your problem now that 
we have this
wonderful resource that is the type-2 list and the internet.

Cheers,

&gt; Hi all!
&gt;
&gt; I've got some questions that're likely to stir up some debate. (I know 
&gt; you've all been waiting for something since the Bus Depot Wars seem to 
&gt; be over! ;-} ) I've the Muir book and at first I thought it was great. 
&gt; But I've been dredging through the archives and now I'm beginning to 
&gt; wonder. I have  subjects that are bothering me and I'd like some 
&gt; opinions:
&gt;
&gt;   1. Timing. Muir says static timing is the best but I've read/heard 
&gt; alot of dissent.
&gt;
&gt;   2. Distributors. Muir says mechanical (009) is best. My problem here 
&gt; is my bus has a 009 and I thought I was lucky that the PO had already 
&gt; put one in for me. Now I'm beginning to wonder.
&gt;
&gt;   3. Warming up. Muir says warm up before you drive. Others disagree.
&gt;
&gt; The book seems to be a great how-to guide for the various repairs 
&gt; discussed but I'm beginning to think that the things that are Muir's 
&gt; opinion need to be taken with a grain (or two) of salt. what's the 
&gt; verdict?
&gt;
&gt; TIA

&gt;
&gt; And what is good, Phaedrus,
&gt; And what is not good---
&gt; Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
