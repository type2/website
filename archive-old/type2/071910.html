For everyone who wanted to see the picture of the bus in Kosovo that was on
the front page of the Chicago Tribune last week, it is scanned and posted
at:

http://24.5.20.233/vw/kosovobus.jpg

The picture didn't scan all that well (some mysterious gridlines appeared)
but it's still interesting, at least to me.

Happy viewing,

-David
