Thanks for the welcome.

Re the Dormobile -- the term is often used (particularly by British folks)
as a generic term for any camper, but Dormobile was actually the brand name
of camper conversions by an English company called Martin Walter &amp; Co. They
started out last century some time as saddle makers or somesuch but by the
1950s they had started to kit out Bedford vans with sleeping equipment,
which was when the Dormobile was born. Martin Walter converted many makes
into campers (the Brits don't like that term -- they insist that Martin
Walter built 'motor caravans') but their most popular models were always
based on Bedfords. I think they converted their first VW Type 2s in the
late 1950s, and they continued doing them right through the bay window era.
Sometime around 1990 the company changed its name to Dormobile Ltd, but by
1994 they were out of business. No more Dormobiles.

As for my 63, well, all I can say is that it's a way cool conversion. Mine
had 72 000 original miles when I bought it and it is totally original. I
have since put 10k miles on it (mostly on long camping trips with my
family!) and all it really needs to be perfect is a respray and new side
panels in back. The Dormobile was VW-approved and mine was originally sold
by the main VW distributors in London, before being driven by the first
owner down Africa to Zambia. The main feature of the Dormobiles (no matter
what vehicle they were based on) was the large pop-up roof which contained
bunks (similar to those in the 68-73 Westfalia -- I think Westfalia copied
the Dormobile design) for two people to sleep. On the split-screen Type 2
the pop-top fits over the standard sunroof opening, which should give you
some idea of the size of the thing -- the bunks are 2m long so they'll
easily sleep two adults up there. Down below are four individual seats
which fold flat to make a double bed or two singles (really nifty
engineering design in these seats). The front pair also swivel to face
backwards so a table can be set up between the two rows. At the back over
the engine compartment are some cupboards made of sheet steel with storage
space for clothing/bedding and food etc, as well as a two-plate gas stove
with griller and a sink with a plunger pump. All the seats fold flat
against the sides to make space when cooking -- as I said, really nifty
design. Mine also has a cool Martin Walter-built custom roofrack which sits
in front of the pop-top.

The Martin Walter pop-top was very popular and one can find them fitted to
campers by other convertors, including Westfalias. I've never seen another
full Martin Walter converted Type 2 in this country, but I have seen three
split-screen Westies with the Martin Walter roof. Also, last year VW Trends
featured a Dormobile-roofed Westy which they called a Dormobile. I believe
a few Dormobiles were sold in Canada and some of those have filtered down
to the northern states in the US. There is a very strong Dormobile club in
the UK, but they have no split-screen Type 2s in their club -- it seems not
many of them were converted and they are now very rare.

Anyway, so much for Dormobiles -- I hope you find that enlightening!
