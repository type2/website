Subject: In need of vent window hing
Message-ID: &lt;38299FB3.82E93270_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Hey
Incoming # 500 (if you haven't downloaded in a couple of days).
I am in need of a small part.  The vent window latch thingy for the
drivers door vent window.  It just slides on and off, or would if I had
one.  Anyone got one that looks good?
Heat, I am so jealous of these people talking of their wonderful heat. 
We got this bus out of South Cal and it's in great shape.  The heating
system looks amazingly intact, but still heat is a whimper.  I know I
need to start from the back to the front but where do you guys get the
time?  Also I am afraid to take this perfect looking system apart after
reading how hard it is to fit together so I guess I just have to live
with being jealous.  Anyway my wife is so incredible in love with it
that I haven't been able to use it once.  Didn't even know she could get
like that over a vehicle.
