&gt;What's a 1978 bus supposed to have?  Cat?

If it was originally a CA model. Does the sticker on the doorjam say CATALYST or NON CATALYST? What about the sticker on the lid in the engine compartment. Does it state whether or not it's a CA model.

&gt;EGR?

Yes.

&gt;Both?

I believe so but I will defer to Karl, the true expert on such matters.

&gt;I assume an 
&gt;emissions tester would go by the VIN model year, 1978, and not any 
&gt;engine code, etc.

Correct.

&gt;What would be needed to bring the bus back to spec 
&gt;before a future inspection?  Most likely places are Portland, OR or the 
&gt;Bay Area, CA.

What are the requirements? If it's a visual inspection that's done first you are already in trouble as you know. If you require the EGR filter and valve you'll also need the linkage, the pipe that connects to the filter and the style of muffler that accepts the EGR filter.

It's all do it yourself work, even adjusting the EGR linkage. Ultimately the gas analyzer will determine whether or not the rest of the engine is in tune.

&gt;and a special thanks to R. Atwell for ratwell_dot_com.

My pleasure.
