Subject: Re: [T2] Double Cab Wood Slats

[...}
I'm about to do the same thing when I paint my 74 SC and I've found some rubber
washers approximately 1/2 inch in diameter with one side metal.  The hole in the
washer is about the size of the screw or rivet used to secure the slats.  I will
put washer under the slat with the metal side facing up.  This will lift the
slat off the bed approximately 1/8 inch.  (they're loose already).  I figured
this way it would allow air to get under the slats which would allow the water
to evaporate and facilitate cleaning.  The rubber washer would also seal the
hole in which the screw/rivet is placed.  Of course I may be all wrong in this
approach.  Greg

&gt; I thought I'd throw this out on both lists just in case somebody out there
&gt; has an answer but only reads one of them
&gt;
&gt; I'm just about to put wood slats in the rear of my Double Cab.
&gt; I will be riveting them on and will be putting clear silicone on the bottom
&gt; of the slats around the rivets
&gt; to prevent water from dripping down the holes.
