Subject: Type2 Gas Mileage

As another data point, I get around 20-22 on flat highways running 55 to 60 
in my 71 deluxe. The motor has around 10k miles on it. But, when I push the 
speed up to 65 average (indicated, and I have BF Goodrich All Terrain T/As, 
a bit larger than stock) my mileage drops dramatically, usually between 15 
and 20.

What is really amazing is how I get better gas mileage in my Bus than I do 
in the wifes '98 Pontiac transporter. The Pontiac is much more aerodynamic, 
has fuel injection with feedback loops, and 30 (or 50) years of engineering 
knowledge behind it. What is all that electronic stuff for if it still 
burns more fuel than my ancient bus?
