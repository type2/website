Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Engine Fan?

&gt; I noticed that the cooling fan on my motor is missing three teeth. From what
&gt; I understand.. the previous owner had the engine rebuilt, but used the older
&gt; parts.. so these teeth probably came off a long time ago before this new
&gt; motor was installed.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if maybe there was some sort of aftermarket &quot;performance&quot;
&gt; fan that I could install in place of that.. maybe one that was slightly
&gt; better designed the allowed more air to flow? Any idea?

get a new fan of the stock design, the missing teeth will cause the fan to
be unbalanced and that will cause problems.  the stock design is adequate
and probably pushes as much air as the stock tin will handle
