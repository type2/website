Subject: The &quot;Ya'll Come Christmas Campout&quot; Directions

I have decided to move the &quot;Ya'll Come Christmas Campout&quot; (formerly
Chranksmasgiving) to a new site.  I think the move will be more comfortable
and enjoyable for all involved.  Plus we will have trees around to block
off any cold wind that might want to blow in.  The previously announced
venue has an open field on a lake, and will do fine for next March for the
&quot;Busses and Bluegrass Festival&quot;, but not for this one.

The YCCC will occur on December 10, 11, and 12, 1999 at the Little Olcmugee
State Park just outside McRae, Georgia.

The directions are as follows:

&gt;From Atlanta:  (approximately 200 miles)
I-75 south to Macon and Interstate 16 east toward Savannah.
I-16 to Exit #14, Go south on Hwy#441
The park is about 25 miles down Hwy 441 give or take a few miles.

&gt;From Jacksonville:  (approximately 120 miles)
Hwy #1 north to Hwy #341 north in Baxley.  (left)
Hwy #341 north to Hwy #280 east just outside McRae.....(right)
Hwy 280 east to Hwy 441 north (only a few hundred yards).......(left)
Go about a mile and your there.

&gt;From Tampa:  (approximately 350 miles)
I-75 north to Hwy#280 east (right)
Hwy. #280 east to Hwy. #441 north
Go about a mile and your there.

&gt;From Savannah:  (approximately 100 miles)
Take I-16 to exit 14, Hwy 441 south.
Go about 25 miles and have a beer.

The fee for camping is $15.00 per night + the park pass, and we can put two
campers per site.  We will have electric hook-ups and water at each site.
I am bringing my sidetent and some tarpage to provide a day shelter in case
it rains, or is really cold which I doubt.

South Georgia is beautiful this time of year.  The trees are still in color
since all the leaves have not fallen yet. I am going to bring a boat (or
two) and some dry gear so anyone thats wants to paddle can do so, and stay
relatively warm and dry.

Bring your guitars and Christmas songs, stories to share, and a willingness
to be easy during a time of year most folks are so stressed it's pitiful.
I am going to make up a box of grab gifts for the group, so if ya got
anything to throw in bring it.

I know many of you are really busy this time of year and I don't expect
this to be a very large gathering, but if ya come you will be welcome.  I
am cooking the turkey on Saturday so feel free to bring fixins and such to
go with the doomed bird.  I am sure we will make due either way though.
Food will be had by all!  No one leaves hungry!

Please reply with any questions directly to me.

Looking forward to it,
Charlie Ford
