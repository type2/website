Subject: Cylinder Head temp sensor - '75 2.0 FI
Date: Fri, 26 Feb 1999 10:59:23 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey Volks:

Is there any easy way to get at the cylinder head temp sensor?  On my 
'75 2.0 FI its right underneath one of the manifold tubes below the tin. 
I understand theres a tool for this - will a deep socket work just the 
same?  Because there's a torque spec for this I'm assuming you have to 
remove the manifold tube - otherwise, how would you be able to get your 
torque wrench in there?  

Thanks
Danny
