Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

 years ago I hit a deer with my bus , 
 
luckly at that time there was no front tire mounted , even though the mount was there , 
 
the deer came from the drivers side , and had the time to run across the front of the bus and get hit by the passanger side.
If it was front mounted , the  deer might have hit the tire and stayed on my side.
 
Hopefully I will never know by hitting another deer !
