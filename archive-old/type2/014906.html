Well, there are many factors...

1968  My preference for styling.  Has the early front door handles like 
      the late '64-67 splits, the small wheel well rolled edge profile, 
      and cool idiot lights in the instrument cluster.  Caveats are a 
      number of 4 month only parts for early '68s and wiper arms that are 
      1968 only.

1969  Functionally the same as late '68s.  Went from button to trigger 
      door handles.  Still has the round side reflectors shared with the 
      Karmann Ghias.

1970  Functionally same as 1969's.  Aesthetic changes were the rectangular 
      side reflectors.

1971  Dual port and disk brakes, so 1 yr only intake manifold with booster 
      port (although '71-74 autostick beetles &amp; ghias may have used the same 
      intake manifold).  More emisions equipment added.  Aesthetically, went 
      to the uglier big flares on the wheel wells.  Also the small 5 lug 
      wheels with the flatter hubcaps that don't use hubcap clips.

1972  Went to the 1700 pancake motor.  Removeable rear apron deleted (makes 
      engine removal much harder).  No top engine access.  The only good 
      thing I have to say about '72s is at least they didn't have smog pumps.
      Aesthetically, has low turnsignals in front, new taillights in back 
      with the backup lights incorporated within.  Rear bumper is one year 
      only (I have 2 FS if anyone needs one).

1973  1700 engine with smog pump.  Bigger front disk brakes.  Top engine 
      access hatch added.  Automatic tranny introduced.  Was this the year 
      the steering box changed?  Aesthetically, front turnsignals moved up 
      in line with fresh air intake.  Square bumpers introduced with front 
      &quot;crumple zone&quot; behind bumper.

1974  1800 engine with dual carbs.  My favorite t4 heads are the 1800 carb 
      heads.  They have the largest valves and are best suited for
aftermarket 
      carbs.  The late 74 automatics may have gone to FI.

1975  1800 engine with FI.  Is this the year the sliding door lock changed?
      I think this is the year the exhaust went from the trapeziod shape 
      with 2 small ports to the triangle shape with 1 large port.

1976  2000 engine with FI.  High geared tranny.

1977  Functionally same as 1976.

1978  2000 FI engine got hydraulic lifters.

1979  Ehaust ports went from oval ports with copper sealing rings to &quot;square&quot; 
      ports with sandwich gaskets.  1 year only heads.  Exhaust went back to 
      trapezoidal shape with 2 small ports.

My recommendation for easiest to economically run over the years and ease 
of finding parts would be the 1969-70.

For campers, I recommend the 1976-78 Westfalias.  Best camper layout and 
the nice 2.0l engine/tranny combo.

I have owned every model year from 1954-79 except '55,'56,'58,'74,'75, &amp; '78.

Dave
