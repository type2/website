Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel door &amp; Engine lid lock

Hi Isaac,

There never was a lock on the fuel hatch. You could either add a  
cabinet lock to the door or change the filler cap to a locking  
version. If your engine lid lock is stuck its easily removed and  
repaired; try spraying it with a penetrating oil.


Happy Trails,
