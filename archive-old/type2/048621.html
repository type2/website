Very true!

&gt; Something to worry about if you

&gt; in your case.  

Not exactly true, tho it is far more serious in a watercooled engine!

&gt; &gt; From &quot;Nathan Wood&quot; &lt;nathan_wood_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;:

&gt; &gt; I went out this morning and checked my oil before I left for the day, it
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; about 25 degrees, I was a little low, so I opened the filler lid on my 74
&gt; &gt; and there was a cream colored substance that smelled like gas! My dipstick
&gt; &gt; had normal oil on it, and didn't smell like gas, so I topped it off and it
&gt; &gt; ran just fine. Has anyone ever had this happen before? what is it? 

&gt; &gt; Another question I had was about something on the list I read a few days
&gt; &gt; ago, I believe someoe said not to run 10w anything if you want your engine
&gt; &gt; to last. My mechanic told me to use 20w50 in the summer and 10w40 in the
&gt; &gt; winter, I haven't had any problems yet, is there something he and I don't
&gt; &gt; know?

Volks,

First, on the &quot;mayonaise&quot; problem:

The white foam you see under the oil fill cap is indeed an oil/water
emulsion.  &quot;Condensation&quot; is true enough as far as it goes, but... The
ideal outcome of combustion in your bus (or any gasoline engine) is CO2
and H2O.  The ideal place for it to go is out your tailpipe.  Now neither
of these ideals ever actually happens in the real world.  First, a little
bit of the output gas leaks by the piston rings and valve guides with ever
stroke of your engine.  Second, combustion is never complete and fuel is
never 100% pure.  One of the major polutants of exhaust gas is various
nitrogen/oxygen compounds.  A secondary on, deriving from impure fuel is
varios sulfur compounds. Along with water and carbon dioxide, these &quot;blow
by&quot; into your crankcase.  If your crankcase/oil is below the boiling point
of water, they then condense into your oil.

This is bad because the NOx and SOx compounds in combination with water
form nitric and sulfuric acids, which ccan eat your bearings and case over
time. There are buffers in your oil (especially newer oils) thatprevent
this damage, but over time they get &quot;used up&quot; and become less effective.

The cure for this problem is to keep your oil temperature up.  From
190-230 is the preferred range.  &quot;How do I do this?&quot; you ask.  Well, that
is what your thermostat and oil pressure relief valves are there for!!!
If you start finding mayo under your fill cap in the winter or in high
humidity situations, then make sure that your thermostat is present,
connected, and functional.

On oil... This varies very heavily depending on climate.  Here in northern
Virginia, I run 20W50 year round.  10W40 is fine in winter, but too thin
in summer.  YMMV!  I would *not* run non-detergent oil in any engine these
days.  The additive package in detergent motor oils is too valuable, not
only for cleaning but for buffering against acid attack, as described
above.
