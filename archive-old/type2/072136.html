Subject: heater booster relay

My heater booster isn't working.  Before I can begin to test the various
components I have to begin with the heater relay: a previous owner who,
trying to save a few $$ (safety aside) has wired the heater bypassing the
relay.  Now instead of using the thermostat/timer there are 4 dashmounted
toggle switches.

These are wired with lamp cord of all the same colour.

So, I'm gonna cut all that crap out, rewire and reinstall the heater relay
and timer/thermostat.  But I need the orginal connector from the wiring
harness: got one?  And/or I need to know which wire connects to which point
on the relay.

I should be able to sort this out via the schematics BUT, if someone has
this information handy, it would be greatly appreciated.
