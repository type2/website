Subject: building the perfect beast

Gentlepersons-
                       ...Being in the habit of not throwing anything away 
until it's really used
up, I've eventually been the owner/driver of chronologically challenged 
vehicles such as
my Bus- '71, thank you - and an odder collection of British sports cars.
                       The Bus started out as the reliable vehicle (16 years 
ago), for the other orphans. As such it is still my daily driver...The 
current thread on vehicle costs
and reliability leads to a question I'd like to pose to the other 
owner/operators: If you
were starting from scratch, which systems/units would you rebuild first, then 
second,
etc? Let's make it a two-part question: First, if it were running- however 
roughly- and
you needed it for transportation, what would take precedence to keep you on 
the road
with as little down time as possible while still working on it and, secondly, 
what would be
the sequence, if you were doing a rebuild. Economy is paramount, here, so 
keep it reasonable.
