Subject: (f) What do you call a group of VW's?

Volks,

Under &quot;unanswerable questions&quot; (at least until next Friday :-).....

it's a flock of Sheep;
it's a gaggle of Geese;
it's a murder of Crows;

but what is a large gathering of VW's?

Here at the end of this Friday, I ask that y'all let me know what is an
appropriate name for a large group of buses (or just VW's)  I will post
the responses next Friday.

My initial proposal is:

it's an embarrasment of VW's :-)

&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
