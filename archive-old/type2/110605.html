This is the COMPLETE system from an 83 Air Cooled Westfalia. 
Yes it will fit water cooled if you can get the compressor 
and mount (A York compressor and mounting bracket for an air 
cooled van is included in the price). This unit was working 
when it was removed from the van. It was removed without 
cutting any wires and keeping up with all the screws, clamps 
relays and such.

This unit has the Wood Cabinet that replaces the overhead 
Westy Storage Cabinet. The cabinet is Tan colored. If you 
like you can use your existing overhead compartment (if you 
have one that is a better match to your interior). There are 
OEM speakers in the speaker holes but you can't use OEM 
speakers because you have to get your hands through those two 
holes to
mount the overhead unit.

The system has all hoses, clamps, dryer, relays, front coil 
w/dual fans, all relays, all
switches, etc. You will need to replace the dryer, as is 
ALWAYS the case when the system is newly installed.

$500 US obo
