Subject: Did a 71' Westphalia interior come with stove?

Hi list,



I have looked through the archives, library, and numerous websites and
cannot find an answer. Did the 71' Westfalia camp interior come with a
stove? If it did, where was it located? I think this has been discussed
before so I apologize, I just cannot find an answer.



Sorry to hear about the GWB Don, if the vehicle does need to be stored
somewhere, because losing it just does not seem right; many rental
storage places house vehicles for $10-15 a month. The storage area
usually has a roof, no sides, but it is better than nothing. It might
give you some time to weigh your options.



Thanks all,



Max Bronsema (1600dp now assembled minus the exhaust -going in next week
I hope)
