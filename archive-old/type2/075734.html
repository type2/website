Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities why not to use header wrap

HEader wrap has been pretty much abandoned by serious racers. The reason,  it
is so effective that it results in a header that reaches near molten
temperatures and seriously shortens its life span.  for this reason i would
advise not wrapping every square inch of your exhaust system with it, not to
mention that would get very expensive.  I personally would limit my use of the
stuff to the box itself, not the exhaust pipes at all, and the tubes that go
from exchanger to the flappers, this should make a big difference and not
causes too many unintended problems.
and of course you may remember my experience with the roofing patch material
and why i cringe at the sight of it......
Jamie, warm and toasty with stock early style heat in 78 westy.

&gt; I dunno, just for fun has anyone tried fixing the stock system that came
&gt; with the bus?  I did and with the exception of one small connector pipe my
&gt; system is all there and in working order.  Know what?  It gets warm as
&gt; hell!  Well, at least it does at the rear seat vent.  By the time it gets
&gt; up front it's lukewarm.  Once you go faster than 20 or 30 it disappears due
&gt; to general bus leakage.  For the longest time I had read gmbulley's page
&gt; about Heat, Rust &amp; Noise in VWs and thought it would be great to do that to
&gt; my bus (78 Westy) but just wasn't motivated enough.  After a camping trip
&gt; to the Shenandoah's I changed my mind.  During the drive I watched our
&gt; Siberian Husky go from sitting on the rear seat to laying down on the rear
&gt; seat to finally laying curled up in a little husky-ball with her tail over
&gt; her nose.  For those of you that don't have a Husky this means that it's
&gt; cold and the dog is preparing to sleep and wake up in a snowdrift.
&gt;
&gt; I did a half-assed job of insulating my bus and that made a huge difference
&gt; in heat (and noise).  I applied Q-pads to the front of the bus (nose, cabin
&gt; floor and doors), in the sliding door, over the engine compartment and
&gt; under the back seat.  I couldn't find the NASA stuff but I used Reflectix
&gt; insulation instead.  This stuff has different R values depending on how you
&gt; position it.  I covered the Q-pads with a layer of Reflectix and then
&gt; duct-taped it down.  In the nose of the bus I took fiberglass insulation
&gt; and stuffed all the nooks under the dash and the corners and replaced the
&gt; front panels.  Under the bus I replaced the ripped paper duct with some 4&quot;
&gt; aluminum ducting and covered that with some HVAC insulation.  I also
&gt; installed an Atwood bilge blower at the front of the duct and wired it to a
&gt; switch on the dash.  I did actually get under the bus and adjust the
&gt; flappers (they were NOT all the way open) but that's it.
&gt;
&gt; The most obvious thing I noticed was how much quieter the van was at
&gt; highway speeds.  It's like being in a different vehicle.  It's much warmer
&gt; too although I still have some nasty drafts up front.  I sealed the front
&gt; vent which helped but I think I need to replace my door seals.  The bus
&gt; gets toasty if you sit at a light though!  My heater cables broke so I
&gt; think when I replace them I'm going to do a few more things to improve
&gt; heat.  Things I'm planning on doing are: put that header wrap stuff on the
&gt; exhaust, insulate the flapper ducts, insulate the plastic accordian ducts
&gt; coming out of the exchangers, insulate the ducts under the front of the
&gt; bus, insulate the belly pan area under the front of the bus, insulate the
&gt; sliding door, add a duct to feed the rear heat blower air from the inside
&gt; of the bus (maybe from the vent that already exists near the floor in the
&gt; fridge cabinet?) and maybe add another fan for the very front of the bus.
&gt; That's a pretty long list so I'm sure some stuff will drop off.  I just had
&gt; a thought about vapor barriers.  You know how the normal barrier is thin
&gt; plastic and how GMbulley recommends using the thickest plastic you can find
&gt; for a vapor barrier?  Well what if you used &quot;space blanket&quot; material for a
&gt; vapor barrier?  It's just mylar after all but it reflects heat amazingly
&gt; well if there's an air space.  You can by cheap versions in Target or
&gt; Sports Authority in the camping section.  They come in those green packages
&gt; along with all the other last-minute camping items you need.  I might try
&gt; this on my sliding door since they're so cheap.
&gt;
&gt; That's it for now.
