&gt; I found the source of the gas fumes. I put installed a new filler neck

&gt; leaking from around the base of the new filler neck. The clamp must not
&gt; have seated correctly. The fuel would run down to the hose between the
&gt; tank and filler pipe leading me to think it was bad. I loosend the clamp
&gt; up made sure the pipe was seated and retightened it. No more leak.

When I did mine, I wasn=B9t sure about the fit either because the piece I cut
had no bend in the middle like the original.  When I put gas in for the
first time I really could smell it badly which made me worry about a leak
but I checked the connections again and figured that the gas going in for
the first time &quot;blew&quot; the gas smell out and simply wafted my way.

The phillips head clamps around the hose piece that were stock bothered me
so I bought new clamps that I could use a nut driver on to make sure I got
them tight.=20
