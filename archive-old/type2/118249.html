Subject: another FI electrical question

My FI engine won't start. I'm following Bentley's procedures for 
troubleshooting the FI system. I'm down to the injectors now.

One Bentley test is to pull the electrical plugs from the injectors 
and to check the resistance between each  terminal and chassis ground.

On all four of my plugs, one terminal does show infinite resistance 
to ground, but the other shows 9 ohms.  I have not yet determined 
which terminal goes to 88b of the double relay and which goes to the 
ECU.

Bentley says to replace the wiring if resistance is not infinite.

Can anyone suggest a reason for my finding 9 ohms to ground?

Thanks, jack
