&gt;The hall sensor suggests that you
&gt;might have a California L-jet setup

Not necessarily.  The hall effect sensor that Mike mentioned was at the
flywheel, not the distributor.  This flywheel sensor was intended for
the service technician's convenience and has no connection with the
ECU.  My '78 Federal version had such a sensor.
