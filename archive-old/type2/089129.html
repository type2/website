Subject: Throttle Cable

Just a quick question--My throttle cable broke at the carb end the other
day. I have a new one coming from John at aircooled_dot_net, I hope in time to
install this weekend. Here's the question: are there any tricks or
particular pitfalls to installing a throttle cable? I'm just looking to find
out what I'm in for. BTW- 74 bus, 1.8 ltr, center mount Weber progressive.

As always, Facts, experienced comments, and two-bit opinions cheerfully
accepted!

Regards,
Dave
