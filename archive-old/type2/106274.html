&gt; &gt; bently suggests without having someone else crank the

&gt; &gt; 79 fed F.I. mated to a 73 automatic transmission in a
&gt; &gt; 74 bus.

one problem you might have however is when you drive,  the early 003
automatic transmission (73-75) had a vacuum modulator for shifting, on
drivers side of transmission (left hand drive) it is near the bottom pan
and a tube runs to the &quot;Carb&quot; for vacuum the Fuel injection doesn't have
the port for the vacuum line, not sure where to put one either, although I
would probably put it in the air distribution box and adjust the tranny to
spec  see section 4 in auto tranny chapter of the Bentley manual for
details
