&gt; Why not?  I think they call it sharing ideas!  Isn't that what this list
&gt; is all about?

&gt; Jeeeeeeze. You really expect Jake to give up all he knows free of
&gt; charge? For Gods sake amn, the doood has got to make a living. Isn't it
&gt; enough that he is willing to share some of his expertise? I suspect you
&gt; are one of the ones that think all music should be free to via Napster.
&gt; And that all art should be in the public domain.

Let's not start this argument...

I know that everyone wants to say their piece now that it's started, but,
I'd appreciate it if people thought about taking this off-list.

Thanks,
