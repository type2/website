If I where to put together a bus tire page, I was thinking about including the
following:

 - Charts showing ETRTO (European tire standard) dimensional
   specifications for 185R14 tires, including SL, C and D load range tires
 - Charts showing inflation pressure vs load for the above tires
 - Charts showing T&amp;RA (North American tire standard) dimensional
   specifications for 195/75R14 and 205/70R14 tires for various load ranges
 - Charts showing inflation pressure vs load for the above tires
 - Explanation of speed ratings
 - Trade-offs between highway, all-season, snow and high performance
   tire designs
 - Links to major tire manufacture web sites and contact info
 - Links to other tire related sites

If anyone else has other items of interest to be included, just let me know.

You might want to note that the customer service for many of these tire
companies will not be much help.  Their references typically to not go back far
enough to include Type 2 busses older than 1980, including Continental.

: &gt; Is anyone interested in my creating a web page covering this and other
issues
: &gt; regarding bus tires?
: 
:  Sounds good to me- It's been tried before (there has been a tyre FAQ around
before) but the specific recommendations have dated. I personally think it
would be worth putting a shortcut to a tyre information summary, preferably
with recommendations for specific tyres available in the US,  down the left
hand side of the type-2 webpage along with the library/archive/bartnotek/events
buttons!!!
