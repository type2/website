Subject: Re: [T2] license light - Karl?

 [...]


&gt; I have another question that I neglected to include the first time.
&gt; The front door jamb switches, part # 113 947 561D, is the same as the one on
&gt; the sliding door starting in 69 [68 did not have it]. This is on buses, not
&gt; Westies.
&gt; How does this switch effect the operation of the rear dome light?
&gt; Does the jamb switch turn on the light only if the dome light switch, on the
&gt; light, is off?
&gt; Having a sliding door switch sounds like you would need a 3 position light
in
&gt; the rear like in the front!

Well, I shot myself in foot asking this question.....
Turns out the early bus sliding door jamb switch was only on an ambulance. But
I know I have seen sliding door jamb switches. So I went to the wrecking yard
where there are 3 75+ buses. All 3 had a switch. It was mounted about 3&quot; down
from the bottom striker bolt. It was the same switch as the right front: a
single wire connector going to ground. The left front was a 2 wire connector
going to ground switch, 1 for the light and 1 for the buzzer circuit.
[unfortunately, all the dome lights were gone]

So from this I can deduce that the door jamb switch was added when the front
dome light switch was removed?
The dome light switch ended at the end of 73 year model.

Does anyone with a 74 bus, not a Westy, have a sliding door jamb switch?
And does it work the rear light?
And does the rear light have a 3 position switch on it?
