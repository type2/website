Subject: black oil after 500 miles

Just my experience, plain English, may help someone.......

On my 79 with 210,000 orig miles oil would not turn black in 2500 mile drain 
intervals.  I did add between 1 and 2 quarts in between drain intervals.

On my 77 with unknown mileage oil would not turn black in 3000 mile drain 
intervals.  No oil added in between drain intervals.

On my current 70 oil is black within 200 miles.  Unknown mileage on motor 
although rebuilt in 87 and driven daily til 96 so we'll guess easily 80k 
maybe upwards of 120k.
Sat from 96 til Aug 99 when I acquired.  Oil filler tube is gunked up 
horribly, leading me to believe rest of motor is not great.  

Since Aug have done 6500 trouble free miles.  No smoke no leaks.  Have 
probably changed oil a dozen times(every 500 miles) and yes still black after 
200 miles of driving.

Gritiness seems at a minimum possibly non-existent.

Simply put I don't like driving around with black oil in the crankcase and 
rest easier knowing it is changed frequently.

This motor has lasted me incredibly well and I feel it owes me nothing if it 
failed tomorrow.

YMMV
