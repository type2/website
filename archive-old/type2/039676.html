Subject: Re:  Pertronix adjustment

John:

make sure that your the pertronix unit is not hitting anything when the
advance plate moves.  I recently installed a pertronix in my 911 and when
the advance plate would rotate, the pertonix unit would hit a screw in the
distributor housing, prohibiting further advance near the end of advance
plate travel.  I had to get a different pertronix unit to get things to
work properly.  Pertronix was very easy to work with and replaced my unit,
no questions asked.
