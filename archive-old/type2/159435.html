&gt;&gt; Hey Ken,
&gt;&gt; Try cleaning it out w/ some brake cleaner.  That's what I did a while
&gt;&gt; ago and that seemed to free it up nicely.
&gt; 
&gt; It actually seems to move pretty freely at the moment.  I can see
&gt; grease or some other lubricant inside.  How far open should it be?

WHOOOOOPS!  I'm amazed nobody caught my error in the last email I sent 
about the aux bypass.  When it gets cold, it OPENS further, not closes. 
  So, if you want to test it out, hook up +12 to the contacts and it 
will heat up and should slowly close until completely shut.  When you 
stick it in the freezer, it will eventually open back up.  How much it 
opens is determined by adjusting that little nut and sliding it up and 
down.  How far opens determines how much extra idle speed you want.

I would get the car running w/ the aux air bypass working correctly 
(closing all the way shut), adjust your idle when the car is warm, and 
then start doing cold-starts and see if you have enough idle speed when 
the car is cold.  If you need more or less idle speed, you can adjust 
accordingly.

Mike
