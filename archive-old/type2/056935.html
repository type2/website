Been a lot of talk about this, and having a large mouth I'd thought I'd throw
in my 2 cents.  As for cutting, I have never cut the fender wells on a bus and
never intend too.  But I have owned Buses with cut fender wells.  I liked the
bigger tires, so I ran the cut fender wells.  I faced the &quot;ewwwww cut fender
wells&quot; many a time and informed people that it wasn't my doing and that was
the way I bought the Bus.  If you want cut fender wells, look around  there
are plenty of Bus that have suffered this fate.  
    Lowering, this I have done but not really intentionally.  My main
objective was to rid myself of reduction boxes.  At the time the only thing
available was the Bus Boys swing axle kit.  They claimed that you would only
lose 3&quot; ride height.  I felt I could live with that.  But upon installing the
kit I found that I lost more like 6&quot;!  I did enjoy the extra performance, but
the ride sucks.  I soon found that if I dropped anything in the bus, it would
roll to the back.  Hence the front got lowered too!  I went round and round
with Bus Boys on this (come to think of it I never did get my 200 page
catalogue).  They claimed that I had to rent their tools.  Living in Va. at
the time, I had to consider shipping.  6 months later I connived Bus Boys to
just sell me the adjusters.  I pondered how to loosen up the front torsion
locks for about 5 minutes, and in another 5 they were loose.  I basically set
one end of the front beam on a block of wood and knocked the locks loose with
a rear torsion bar from an old bug.  It was done, my Bus was now 6&quot; off the
ground on all four corners.  As time went by I grew older, (the Bus did fine,
no bearing problems), but it was I that was starting to have problems.  You
know those hemorrhoid commercials you laugh at when your younger.  Well, after
a certain age you don't laugh anymore.  So my lower Bus sits in the backyard,
while I drive a baywindow and a 57' single cab (stock height).
  Peace, Love, and if anyone's interested in a lowered 59' standard, let me
know!
