Subject: Diagnoses found

For those who sent responses to my plea for help, thanks.  The prize goes to
those people who thought it was a dropped valve seat.

In fact it appears that the valve seat lifted out of the head, and then cocked
to one side, and the #3 exhaust valve proceeded to pound it into the exhaust
port. It was pounded through the head, and into the top of the #3 piston.
Needless to say the head, and the #3 cylinder are toast.

Due to the high mileage on the engine 127,000+ original miles, it was decided
that a replacement or rebuild was in order.  Due to the pressing need for a
vehicle right now, I opted the replacement option.  I ordered from AVP, and
should have it by wednesday, or thursday, and have it installed and back on
the road by next monday.

Thanks again for your suggestions.

Cheers,

David
