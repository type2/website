&gt; &gt; Have an oil leak from a big srew in piece about 1.5
&gt; &gt; inches in diameter just in from of the bottom of the
&gt; &gt; oil filter that screws into the case.  Is there a tool
&gt; &gt; to tighten or do I just need a gargantuan flat head screwdriver?
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the oil pressure relief valve. That would be a big screwdriver.
&gt; What do people use?
&gt;
&gt; I've seen such a tool in the Porsche tool catalogs but it was $30 so there
&gt; must be an inexpensive alternative.

Without disparaging the proper tool at all I have used a coin clamped in a
vice-grip in emergency situations.  Try a number of different
denominations for the best fit then clamp it hard in a vice-grip.

Further comments:

In that area of the engine there are other potential leak sources that
may show up as drops hanging from the relief valve.  Check the oil
pressure sender, the oil filter gasket, and the dipstick bellows.

I believe (from very old memory) that the gasket on the pressure relief
valve plug is a crush ring not an O-ring.  See part &quot;U&quot; at your page

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/GasketSet.html

but I could be wrong on that.

                             OOK!
