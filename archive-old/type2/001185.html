Thanks to all who responded and gave me the www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/vwindex/
address. Now, I am considering wrapping my exhaust manifolds, etc as Mr.
Bulley did.  I am concerned that this will cause them to rust out quickly.
That stuff is bound to hold moisture.  Does anyone have experience with this
&quot;header wrap&quot;? (in a non-stainless application).
    Also, do y'all use hi-temp silicone to repair heater boxes? Sounds like
a good alternative to paying $190 each for new, but is it a decent cure for
usual-type decay?
