Subject: Shift Lever Extension/Adjustment

Volks:
Put a new tranny in my '71...what a difference!  The
only difference I can see is that the shift throws are
now longer (ie farther away from me) than they were
before.  As far as I can tell, there isn't a way to
adjust this.  I know they made (make?) a little
extension deal that goes on the shift lever to shorten
the throw.  Does anyone have one they'd be willing to
part with?  Coversely, does anyone know a source of new
ones?  

TIA,
