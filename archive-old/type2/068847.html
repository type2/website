Subject: '80 vanagon westfalia: charging system

I'd like a confirmation denial of my diagnosis of a problem.  To whit:

Symptoms:
- - the battery indicator tends to drop down to yellow a day or two
  after charging with a battery charger
- - while the engine is on, the green indicator is on
- - immediately after turning the engine off, the indicator usually
  stays green for ten minutes or so, then turns yellow
- - new battery, old one replaced due to the above symptoms, no change

Diagnosis:
- - since this happens with old and new batteries, and the voltage is
  apparently fine during operation, the voltage regulator is
  not functioning correctly.

Yes/no/other?
