Subject: Re: [T2] Adm. Any Ideas

If I'm not mistaken chopper is a lady named Gail. She has a daughter that
gets onto chat rooms and it appears that she just always gets the virus
first.
I don't think its her fault just bad luck!
I suspect the subjects are picked up from MS Outlook Email and Address
Books.
I think that if we all cleaned out our E-mail boxes and deleted all our
addresses we could kill this cycle, but there are no guarantees.

 REMOVE the _ in front of the address and he'll get your reply.
 
 http://vil.nai_dot_com/vil/virusSummary.asp?virus_k=99069 Information on 
 the virus you are sending.
 
 I just got a message from, _peterkavanaugh_at_cruzers_dot_com ,
_volksfix_at_bellsouth_dot_net , _groch_at_worldchat_dot_com _.henryk_at_endirect.qc_dot_ca , 
_chopper_at_inet-direct_dot_com, _zavlomja_at_ec-red_dot_com please note the lower bar
on the front of  the address.
 Recently I've gotten five or six messages from different people with 
 this _ in front of the name.
 Please delete any addresses in your Address directory with the _ 
 (low Bar) in front of them. The messages I've been getting have a 
 mpeg file attached that makes my Windows Media Player Pop up. 
 However I block the virus because I just download E-mail and then my 
 computer disconnects from the web.
 If you've got a virus program you should run it.
 I've gotten these mpeg Virus infected messages from several other 
 people so it appears that one person got infected and the virus is 
 propagating through list members address books.
 If you have any problem with this message please let me know. I want 
 to be sure that I'm not sending it own although I've run my virus 
 program it might not disinfect this particular varmint.
