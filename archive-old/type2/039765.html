&gt; re CB antenna- I remember reading somewhere that you need a GROUND PLANE
&gt; for a typical CB antenna to work optimally, and for fiberglasss roofs,
&gt; you can get antennas with their own tuned ground (the antenna is part of
&gt; the lead in wire to the radio, and cannot be shortened).  Magnetic mount
&gt; antennas really don't offer a ground plane (all that paint, like
&gt; glass-mounted antennas interfere) but have their own ground as
&gt; mentioned.  If you buy a GP antenna, even a gutter mount should work
&gt; without cutting a hole in the roof.  I think George Lyle can answer this
&gt; better......

OK, I'll give my 2 cents worth.

The best mount for fiberglass top Westys is a gutter mount, but it has to
be a good one for best results.  It has to attach securely to get a good
ground plane.

I like the 6-foot firestik antennas (check at truck suppliers) as the best
compromise between height and function.  Anything longer than 6 feet will
be too tall from the gutter mount.  A small spring might be advisable to
save the gutter if you drive under a tree.

To work properly, the antenna must be cut to match the vehicle.  This
requires an SWR meter or an antenna analyzer, which most sane folks don't
have.  Round up a ham radio operator or get a trucker's radio shop to help
you out.

Don't expect CB to work miracles.  It's good for car-car communication,
but past a mile or so it is iffy.

A thought:  If you're just trying to talk between your friends, FRS
hand-held radios work a lot better and require _no_ installation.

Or, you can go off the deep end like me and sit for your ham radio exam!
Then you can spend _lots_ of money!
