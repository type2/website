Subject:  Heating a VW bus (and isolators)

&gt;hey there -- aren't those dish type rigs supposedly the most dangerous
things around?? Where do you mount yours to make sure you don't asphyxiate?
I am totally scared of them but would love to go that route if there is a
safe way to do it.

also -- iyo is it easier to mount and deal with a straight isolator than
the relay system
&lt;

Jamie,
        Regarding the danger of asphyxiation.  Normally....I would worry
about it...if we were talking about a newer vehicle. But....we are talking
about a 30 year old bus that is about as air tight as an old wicker basket.
 I mean...who are we kidding?  99% of us cannot light a match at 55mph with
ALL our windows shut tight.  For good measure, I do crack the front windows
about 4 inchs while sleeping for added peace of mind..  BTW, there are
devices out there that alert you of dangerously high toxins in the air. 
They are pretty cheap, too.

        The safest way (nothing is totally safe)  of having good heat in a
bus while stationary that I have heard of is to install a factory gas
heater.  Personally, I feel safer with the system (propane) I am using.  I
understand its mechanics.  The factory gas heaters sound like a time bomb
to me (though I will be &quot;learning&quot; myself on one next Summer).. 

        I am always amused by the folks that chime in noting things that
are not safe.  Agreed, breathing fumes from a burning device while sleeping
can kill you.   Not wearing a seat belt can kill you.  A drunk driver can
kill you. Duh.....be careful. All of this stuff is COMMON SENSE...I think. 
You cant win if you dont gamble...I always say. 

        On the issue of isolator vs relay:  As far as &quot;easier to mount&quot;, I
would put both processes about the same in difficulty of installation,
though I must admit, I have never done the relay route.  The relay system
is really the way to go as  far as a long term level.  I have also heard
that the relay system provides full gen/alt power to the batts where the
isolator steals some.  The isolator route, in my experience works great,
but does burn out eventually.  Most folks report about a year to two years
use for the cheapies.  I have heard people say they paid top dollar for an
isolator and it has lasted indefinitely.  I am sure that the isolator
system gets its bad name from the folks like me that get &quot;what we pay for&quot;
at $20 bucks from Whipme.  The only reason that I will continue to use it
in this bus is because I am too lazy to rewire things for the relay format.
 The next bus I set up, I will probably take the relay route.

        If everything boils down to dollars vs longetivity, where do our
buses fit in?
