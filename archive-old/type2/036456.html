Subject: 78 Exhaust Question

Mates,

The time is nearing to re-install my 78's engine and get things going again.
However, first I'll need complete exhaust from the heater boxes back... I
admit I know little about exhaust, so I pose:

There seems to be something peculiar to the 78.  What is it?  Ron has
&quot;Complete Exhaust System (75-78 Bus)  79.95 AC251673&quot;, but all the other
kits, e.g. EMPI do not include the 78 model year.  Should I be aware of
something before I go buying a system?  Also, after checking the archives I
noted that there's a fair deal of disgruntled EMPI owners in VW-land.  If
this is the case, what's the preferred option?  (Bread is a concern).

If someone can forward me a list of ALL the necessary components (when I
pulled those rusty things I PULLED them), I would be eternally grateful.

Thanks

Justin Smith
