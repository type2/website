Subject: My Electrical issues part deux

Took the battery back to wallyworld this morning. They put it on the
machine which declared it &quot;good&quot;.

Got back, decided to try something new. I popped every fuse out of the
holder. Put the battery in, disconnected the coil, cranked the
starter. It turned!!! WooHoo!!!

Ran a jumper from the battery to the + side of the coil, tried again.
Highspeed clicking then nothing. Went back and disconnected
everything, still nothing. Not even clicking. Battery is still fine.
It started the Volvo no prob.

Started checking everything connected to the coil... The wire to the
carbs for the chokes and plungers is showing ground. I disconnected
each item from the wire and still got ground. (I disconnected each
item one at a time... I may try pulling them all at once and see, or
testing them individually with no wire.)

Re-injured my shoulder so I'm done for now. :(
