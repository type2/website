&gt;Yup with two &quot;U&quot;s. 

Yes, but thec U's are in different places.  FURTHUR, as posted on 
the front of Ken Kesey's bus as immortalized in the book The 
Electric Koolaid Acid Test.

p.s.  The Furthur Fest in Camden, NJ was fantastic.  5 continuous 
hours of really great music!  (Unfortunately, also 5 continuous 
hours of really wet rain.)
