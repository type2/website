&gt;Harummph...Well, if that's the prevailing sentiment on this list, looks like
&gt;I won't be starting that red-'71 Westy-with-'73-seats-only club.  And I was

Ron,

Do what I did.  Form your OWN club, don't let anybody join, be the
President of same and then kick yourself out of office for being
a &quot;snooty bastard&quot;.  Tremendous insights - free !

It works !!
