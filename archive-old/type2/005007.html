DOH!

I was just thinking of the drive home from school today.  THAT was at
186,001 mph, you are correct, of course.  My analogue clock didn't loose a
second during the trip .... unh, well it only took 1.07 milliseconds anyway.
Respectfuely,
Steve

&gt;Steve:
&gt;Hate to disappoint you but you're off by a factor of 3600. That's mps,
&gt;not mph.
&gt;Garp's bus is probably RHD so maybe they don't have to  go so fast as
&gt;LHD's.
