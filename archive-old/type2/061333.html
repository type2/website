Hi Volks,

&gt; You may be right on the money, but if you call to order parts or accessories

&gt; is. 

I'd assume some do, and some don't -- just like the VW dealers'.  
I've actually heard VW dealers proclaim that &quot;there's no such thing 
as a '76 T2, the T2 was introduced in 1980.&quot;  NOT!

&gt; All of my parts and accessory catalogs list the Vanagon as a T2, and the
&gt; Eurovan as a T4.  They usually further give the years to not confuse the
&gt; Vanagon T2 with the Bus T2.

That may very well be so, but it still is wrong.  See the literature. 
To remedy the situation, I'd advise everyone with a T3 to refer to 
their bus as one, and not as a T2.  To help the correspondant see 
their error, you might use phrases such as &quot;T3 (1984 Vanagon)&quot;.  But 
please do not spread the misuse of T2 for the T3.

I know I'm fighting a windmill here, but a man can dream can't he?  
;-)

But I'd be pleased if even only the misuse of T4 for the Type 4 could 
be halted.  :-)

Yours,
    Erik.
