&gt;Basically I hooked up my head temp gauge and as this engine has broken in:
&gt;head temps started out around 350-400 at 60 mph cruise, now they are at
&gt;400-450+ and even though it runs great I am worried that it will blow on a
&gt;long trip from Atlanta to West &quot;by God&quot; Virginia I have planned. Oil temps
&gt;are below 210.  It is a Type 1, 1835 DP with Solex progressive carb, Engle
&gt;110 cam, 7.6:1 compression, dual QP exhaust.  Like I said, I have a hunch
&gt;that the 2nd barrel of the carb is jetted too small causing it to run lean

&gt;Timing is 009 at 8 btdc. (flame on)

Oh yeah.  You don't have enough advance at part throttle, for starters.  To 
test the theory you could set initial to 12-15BTDC and get back on the 
freeway.  Don't leave it that way though, and don't floor it.

Second consideration - what air correction jet are you running?  Try 
dropping it a few sizes to richen the mixture at higher rpms (like your 
60mph cruise).  This assuming your carb HAS an air correction jet - I'm not 
familiar with a Solex progressive.

Actually before you do that you should pull a spark plug or two and check 
the color.  If the plugs are white you will have confirmation that the 
temps are from a lean condition.
