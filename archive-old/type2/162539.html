&gt; Betting that you have fried the coil.  :-((

engine was running, just stopped!!

&gt; Coil will get hot if you just leave the ignition on...and yes, I have
&gt; fried one that way too....walked off and forgot ignition was on for about
&gt; 45 minutes.

been there done that coil was actually cool to the touch

&gt;
&gt; Ok, down to the real nitty gritty(frothy beverage in hand).
&gt;
&gt; Coil only needs a make and break to ground from the points side to make a
&gt; spark.
&gt;
&gt; unplug pertronix and everything else on the coil.
&gt;
&gt; Run hot wire directly to coil.
&gt;
&gt; run a piece of wire from points side of coil and momentarily touch it to
&gt; ground and then back from ground.

dead short!!!   I think my new MSD coil is kabluee

&gt; Make spark?  Try it with a different coil.

gotta dig one out of garage, I'm done for today

thanks
Bob

grabbing another frothy beverage
