&lt;&lt; Wayne,

         Concerning your loosey-goosey wiper assembly, the quickest fix I 
know 

is to find a good replacement unit, perhaps from a wreck.  &gt;&gt;

Just on the odd chance...Anyone know of a cross reference to other
vehicles that might have some/any of the mechanicals for the wipers?
...Or any other type 2 parts for that matter... ?-)
