Subject: Re: [T2] Math Teacher trailer hitch

Jamie

took a real good look at your proposed trailer hitch design, and I don't
think it has a chance of working unless you are hauling a VERY small and
light trailer.  that bar accross the back is not supported very well but
worse is the long span of the crossbar.  if you slam on the brakes the
trailer would bend that bar in the middle and drive the trailer hitch into
the back of the engine...I would head back to the drawing board...
