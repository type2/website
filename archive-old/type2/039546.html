Subject: Fuel Injection to Carbs?

    Hello everyone.  The gas tank pull and reinstall
was successful.  Thanks to everyone for all the help
and advice.  Yesterday, my bus started (very
reluctantly) for the first time in 2 years.  The
problem is that once it started, It was at full
throttle and wouldn't come down.  The only way it
would start is with a friend playing with the vaccuum
lines.  They are made out of vinyl tubing, is this
correct?  Or should I replace them with some sturdier
rubber tubing?  Also after removing a fuel injector,
there was a bit of crud in them, looked like sand, but
hard to tell.  Is there a method I should use to try
and clean them?  One other question.  Are there any
members out there that have switched from fuel
injection to carberators?  I've just never had to deal
with fuel injection before and it has me a bit lost. 
Sorry this is so long and thanks again everyone.  =)
