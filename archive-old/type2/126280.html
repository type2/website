Subject: Re: [T2] Re: CHT Gauge Accuracy

Hi Bob,

I am running a new sensor in the gauge on my bus and am getting similar 
readings... a lot higher than the last 2 sensors I've had. I don't yet 
have an oil temp gauge, but oil temps respond much slower than head 
temps.

BUT... At the same time I changed the CHT sensor I also changed over to 
FI. So there are a few other issues I'm going to look into before I 
blame the gauge. It might be a clogged injector, or an intake leak on 
the runner or the gasket between it and the plenum.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I have the same problem.  Brand new VDO CHT gage just installed on my 
&gt; bus.  Used only the provided materials for the install (i.e., no extra 
&gt; wire length needed). Found that the wires in the harness were swapped 
&gt; such that the black wire needs to connect to the + terminal and the 
&gt; red to the - terminal.  On a short 10 minute drive to work at 35 mph, 
&gt; I'm getting 360 degree readings.  This on a newly rebuilt engine with 
&gt; a newly rebuilt and adjusted AFM.  Driving down the freeway yesterday 
&gt; at 60-65 MPH I was getting 400-425 degree readings. Oil temps the 
&gt; whole time were about 180 degrees.
