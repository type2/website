Subject: Re: [T2] Sending Unit O-Ring needed?

And be careful reinstalling it! Maybe I'm just a klutz
(maybe??) but I managed to put one in with a big kink
in it and it didn't seal! -BaH

 Hello lists, I just got my 75 Riviera running and
 driving, for the first time in atleast 9 years.
 
 My problam now is I have a fuel leak coming from the
 Sending unit o-ring. So where do I find one? What
 size
 is it?
 
 I always see posts about replaceing your fuel lines,
 which I did, but I have never seen anyone say to
 replace or check the O-Ring.
 
 So if it has been said before then I missed that
 post,
 but if it hasn't been said. I am now!
 
 Check those fuel tank sending unit o-rings also when
 you are checking and replacing the fuel lines. 
 
 Thanks, and hope everyone is enjoying the long
 weekend.
