Subject: (almost)Westy Gold Vinyl Located!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9903232128010.13329-100000_at_larry_dot_cas.utk_dot_edu&gt;


&gt;&gt;This stuff almost matches the gold vinyl found in the late '60s-early
'70s Westfalia interiors.&lt;&lt;

I found a good 30 yards of this stuff today, folks...

It's not an exact match for the original, but it's the closest I've ever
seen.  Even has the faux-leather &quot;graining&quot; in it.  Has original-type
netted backing instead of fuzzy, the supplier says that this is the &quot;old
style&quot;, probably NOS from the 60's-70's.

The color is a little more &quot;golden&quot; than my original stuff, but I've never
seen what it looked like new so it might've changed colors.

If there's interest, I'll buy what he's got and try to get him to order
more.  But he mainly deals with factory overstock and remnants.

Price will be $6.50 per yard, 54&quot; bolt.  I have no idea how much it will
take, best get an upholsterer to look at the situation.  My best guess is
ten yards per van, but I'm an amateur at the upholstery biz.

First come, first serve.

Anyone?
