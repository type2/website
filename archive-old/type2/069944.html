Subject: Administrative droning...

There's been a fairly substantial wave of newbies over the past few days.
There must have been a thread about us on v_at_l or something.

- --Lots of questions about an archive. I'm working on it (hard) but it's not
ready for market yet. Searchable web pages are not difficult. Searchable
web pages that don't send you back millions of irrelevant or redundant hits
when you look for things like &quot;compression ratio&quot; are tough and take time.
Any question you have is probably answered somewhere in the immense v_at_l
archive, which can be accessed from Skip Montanaro's web page, whose URL I
do not know.

- --Digest people: when replying to a message, you have to paste in your
subject line. Otherwise your message will refer to &quot;type2-digest #63&quot; or
some such. It's not a hanging crime, but there are a few folks who seem to
be under the impression that proper subject lines are not possible in
digest mode; they are, too.

- --Some people are posting to type2 and type2-digest simultaneously. If you
do this your message is reflected twice to everybody on the list. Only send
public messages to type2_at_primenet_dot_com, they'll make it into the digest just
fine.

- --Please oh please, only quote for context. This ain't Usenet. We have
things to do besides email.
