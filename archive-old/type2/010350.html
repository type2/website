I have seen some pics of the Brazillian Type II bus. It has an elevated
roofline giving extra headroom. I also saw that BTLMEX is getting new VW
Beetles into the USA by doing chassis swaps and thought I would ask if they
could do a similar service for the Brazilian busses. So I asked them and
got this reply:

Hello Robert:

I have never made a bus before. I am sure it can be made, but I would need
some assurance that there is a market for them. Are you sure that the new
body fits the old chassis?

Please let me know,

Miguel

&gt;What would it cost to get one if it is possible?
&gt;I know it is a big question, but these busses are apparently built from
the
&gt;69 - 79 Type II &quot;breadloaf&quot; chassis.

So, I am asking the list if they could help me out with the info that
Miguel needs. Is it possible to do a chassis swap with a Brizillian bus?
And, is there a market for them?
