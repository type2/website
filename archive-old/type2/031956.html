John:

The timing mark (I won't dignify it with the term &quot;notch&quot;) is on the 
front of the pulley, i.e., on the engine side.  It runs pretty much the 
full thickness of the pulley.

&gt; I'm trying to adjust the timing in my '81 vanagon (calif) since I've just

&gt; timing notch.  From earlier posts I've learned that the timing indicator is
&gt; a small notch in the pulley (which looks like someone took a hacksaw to
&gt; it).  I've found a couple of these 'notches' on my pulley... which one is
&gt; correct?  One I found was on the outer diameter of the pulley on the front
&gt; side of the belt (front of course being toward the front of the vanagon).
&gt; The other is on the backside of the belt on the outer diameter of the
&gt; pulley.  Does anyone with a similar vehicle know if one of these 'notches'
&gt; is the correct timing indicator???
