Subject: Re: Need help finding used VW Pick up parts

when I got my 71 there was a little plastic U shaped bracket that had 2 clips on
it (almost like interior panel clips)  that pressed into those holes that would
only let the pedal go down so far...except my pedal is out of whack and it would
catch on that clip... so i used it for cruise control 8)
maybe its to prevent WOT? hehe



&gt;   What is the purpose of the two holes in the
&gt; floor right under my gas pedal (71 model)?  They are near the top edge of the
&gt; pedal when it is pressed to the floor.  Can anyone clue me in?
