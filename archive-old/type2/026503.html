&gt;This weekend I'm going to install a new urethane shift coupling. 
&gt;Any one got tips or tricks for that project?

Yeh, don't!!  Take it back and get a rubber one instead.  

I put a poly-urethane one in my 73 last Spring when my old one failed and
HATED it.  It transmitted a LOT of transmission noise into the cab.  I ran
it on there for 4 months living with that horrible raspy whine coming up my
shift rod before spending the $8.00 to get a rubber one.  Now everything is
back to normal and, quite frankly, I can't tell any difference
performance-wise between the poly one and the rubber one.

My opinion - YMMV (your mileage may vary for you new initiates)
