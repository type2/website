Subject: taillight problem, transmission problem 73 westy

Hello Everyone!

I am new to the list, this is my first posting. But here goes. I have 2
questions about my brothers '73 Westy.

1.When I turn the lights on, ONLY the right taillight works, but when I push
the brake pedal only the left taillight works. Its got me stumped, any help
or ideas are greatly appreciated.

2. It has an automatic tranny that I think is going out. It is hitting
pretty hard when it shifts. Sometimes when I put it in drive, it just spins
for awhile before it goes into gear and at high speeds it wont always shift
until the rpms are to high. Anyway, is there anything I can do other than
put a new transmission in, if not where can I get a good one.

Thanks, love the list. Learning alot.
