Oops, forgot to mention Mark at Salem Imports. Sorry :)

There is also Foreign Accents in Greensboro, NC 336 294 2137. The do it all form air-cooled VWs to Maserattis. The owners are both experienced ACVW mechanics and own VWs. Scott has 8 bugs and 4 things. Randy has 3 synchro vanagons. They do top notch work at top notch prices. 

Also in Greensboro is Danny's Auto. He races bugs and fixes all kinds of cars. Don'T have the number handy but p-mail if you need it.

You can also go to www.westfalia_dot_org for a nationwide listing of VW shops. 

If you join NEATO or Limbo you can get the TTT directory with a nationwide listing as well.
