Subject: Re:Paul Callender's reverse gear problem
Content-Disposition: inline

It doesn't grind at all when I try to select reverse. The harder I push
the lever, the more resistance is felt. I've also tried tonight to
'manually' select reverse by taking off the shift linkage at the gearbox
end and moving the gear selector by hand (tools). I got 1st and 2nd,
I had to adjust the floor plate in the cab A LOT. One guy told me
you should never need to touch this, but the company I got the gearbox
from said you always have to adjust it.

Anyway, I think I'll be returning the gearbox back to the place I got
it from, they said if it doesn't work they'd try another with me, and
I'm gonna make sure this one is tested first!

[...]Does it grind and not want to go in or does it feel like
a stone wall??  That is something is blocking
you from engaging the gear and the harder you push
the harder it pushes back??
