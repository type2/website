Subject: Re: [T2] Monza style exhaust,

Something to keep in mind with the Monza style is that they don't exit to 
the side enough like the stock muffler. This means that you could possibly 
pull exhaust fumes into the cabin if all your seals aren't perfect due to 
the vacuum created at the rear of a bus while moving.

Subject: [T2] Monza style exhaust,


&gt; So I really like the look of the Monza style exhaust, twin tips,  but I'm 
&gt; searching for &quot;the one&quot; to go on my upcoming Boston Bob 2L for my '73. 
&gt; Anyone got a line on where I can source a good monza style exhaust ? I am 
&gt; going to be keeping my stock '73 HE's.
