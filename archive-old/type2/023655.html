I have a 71 Westy and there is no way that it can be opened from the
inside.  Are there different versions of the rear hatch lock?
&gt;
&gt;Fortunately, no such problem exists with the rear hatch, which can 
&gt;be unlocked 
&gt;from inside regardless of the keyed status. Good for me, bad for 
&gt;transporting 
&gt;curious kiddos in my 71 (which has yet to happen).
