Subject: Rust treatment (chemical)

Tony... You and I e-corresponded some weeks ago concerning rust treatment 
products.  My local Benjamin Moore gonniff wanted to charge me twice what you 
pay for the stuff.  I was browsing the Tractor Supply catalogue and noted they 
offer a rust treatment product around $20/gallon... bought some the other day.  
Had planned to work up under the front pan area of my 69 Bay; unfortunately we 
are having some serious rain today.  Will let you know how it works out when I 
get to it.  Thanks again for your info..... Glenn
