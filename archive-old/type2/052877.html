Hello everyone...
  A quesion was raised about front seats recently and got me thinking. The PO of my beloved 68 bus put in late 70's seats for comfort I suppose. My ideas for the resto include updating the interior a bit.
  Assuming most of you have a Motorworks catalog, or maybe a sewfine catalog, you have probably seen the &quot;sport seats&quot; they offer for $925. a pair. They come with the seat adapters for T1 and T3, but it is not needed for the Bus. Any ideas on how these might be mounted? the seats the PO put in were spot welded to the seat pedestal (very sloppy too).
  thanks in advance... Peace

Peace &amp; Harmony
