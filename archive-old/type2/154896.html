Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Vacuum values

&gt; Vacuum varies, according to throttle position (and manifolld pressure): Full 
&gt; throttle, climbing a hill, vacuum is at its least. Coasting downhill, foot off 
&gt; throttle, vacuum is at its greatest. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you've ever driven a really old car (early-1950s and before) that had 
&gt; vacuum-operated windshield wipers, you've seen the relationship. In my 1953 
&gt; GMC pickup truck: coasting downhill in gear at high speed, foot off throttle, 
&gt; the wipers go very fast. Climbing uphill, pedal to the metal, wipers barely 
&gt; move. 
&gt; 
You can also see the relationship if you have ever seen a &quot;fuel mileage&quot; gauge, which is nothing but a vacuum gauge, my moms 1997 SL380 has one from the factory, which is the first time I have seen that, but you can also buy them from any auto parts store and install them yourself.

When you push the pedal to the floor at a low RPM it drops the vacuum to nothing, cruising along at 55 with the accelerator barely pressed you have a lot of vacuum and the gauge will show that you are getting good mileage.

Conclusion, with the butterflies wide open at low RPM, you don't have much vacuum at all.
