Subject: Re: [T2] no oil pressure on fresh rebuild

&gt; So, I cranked the car over for about 20 seconds without the plugs, and
&gt; the oil light stayed on.

1.  Make sure the oil pressure switch is attached to the correct wire and
not shorted out.
2.  If it's a type IV motor, did you pre-fill the oil filter?  Those suckers
hold nearly 3/4 quart so if it's empty it could take several seconds to pump
it full of oil.
