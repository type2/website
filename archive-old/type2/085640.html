If memory serves me right, I think the input shaft only sticks out 4&quot; or
so from the throwout bearing, if that. It has been over a year since I
pulled an engine, so someone correct me if I am wrong.

Subject: [T2] Engine removal question.




So here I sit.. dirty, tired and greasy, with my engine half out of my
bus.  
I'm stuck, I'm cursing at myself loudly, and I think I might have called
the 
engine a few names. Amazingly I went without the traditional engine
removal 
beer tool, and maybe the powers that be are laughing at me for my folly
:-)

I managed to pull the engine as far as I can to the rear apron. and now 
looking between the engine and trans I see (a mile I guessed in anger)
the 
input shaft seemingly has gotten longer... or its coming out of the
trans. 
(Please god no I'll be good I promise) 

Has anyone had a similar experience.. I removed the coil to allow a
couple of 
more inches, but I dont see the input shaft splines.. I think I broke 
something and now that the andrenaline has died down I think I might
just 
cry.  

If it turns out serious enough, is there someone close to Modesto, CA
with 
some similar experiences that can maybe point at the situation and say
do 
this?

If not I just need some advice and beer money. 

Thanks

Tyler
