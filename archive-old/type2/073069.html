    London, Ontario, Canada here....   I've got a problem with my 2000cc
fuel injection, 1976  bus.   On a cold start...everything fine...cranks up
great....BUT....if I try a give a just a little gas to move it...she dies
out....????? I have to sit there for...say 5 - 10 minutes until she warms
up...then everything is ok....   Have you got any ideas on what is the
problem???   Thanks.....Patrick Mullin
