Gary,

You don't gain anything structurally, but you do gain a flat surface to
lay your flooring on and some isolation from road noise.
I have a sheet of 1/4&quot; ply on my floor, on top of expanded polyethylene
sheeting.  This stops the ply from drumming against the metal and also
provides some extra insulation and a vapour barrier.

&gt; Did the Campers originally use plywood to offer some structural
&gt; support
&gt; to keep the floor from flexing?  The metal underneath is rust free, so
&gt; i
&gt; am puzzled about why they went to this trouble.  Thanks for your help.
