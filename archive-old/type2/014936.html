Pat........The smell in the fumes you are noticing is not carbon monoxide,
because CO is odorless. But carbon monoxide might be mixed with them. You
need to distinguish between offensive/unpleasant....and deadly.

Get a battery operated Nighthawk CO sensor at Wal-Mart, Meijers, or Lowes,
and put it in your vehicle and run some tests to see if the fumes you smell
contain the deadly but odorless gas carbon monoxide (CO).

I am guessing the fumes are from the interior of the heater boxes, which
probably have some anti corrosion coating that is off gassing.

But for the sake of safety, get a monitor and be certain.

&gt;&gt;Now that winter is near, and I am using the heater, I get an
&gt;&gt;exhaust smell in the bus.  I don't think that the heat exchangers are
&gt;&gt;leaking, but how would I check without pulling the exhaust system off?
