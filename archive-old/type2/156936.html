&gt; What about a recently rebuilt AC motor makes it get such lousy MPG
&gt; initially?

Well, the surfaces are a bit rough initially and have to get run in.
Also, you've probably made other changes (carb, distributor, adjustments)
that also need to be dialed in.  Third, if you have changed your
compression ratio this can lower mileage.
