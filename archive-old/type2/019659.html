&gt; Since exchangers aren't dismantled, 

My impression from Bentley was that you could pop the seam on the
earlier (upright engine) heat exchangers and open them up, but I don't
think that's an option with the later ones. I could be wrong.

&gt; I'm going to use some cleaning agent (Nikki, didn't you
&gt; recommend POR 15?) &amp; hose out the exchangers.

Yep, that was me. I used the POR-15 Marine Clean degreaser on my engine
tin before I painted it. The crud just hosed off with the garden
sprayer. It was pretty impressive. I understand that cleaner is
water-based. (So's Simple Green, but it's stinky.) That's what I'd do if
I were in your position. It's just my idea -- someone else may have
other ideas for safely and effectively cleaning out your heat
exchangers. You could also just let 'em sit in the sun for a few days to
neutralize the gunk by baking and airing out, if you're not in a hurry.

&gt; Additionally, since I'm still not exactly certain where the exhaust is
&gt; getting into heater system - above or below engine tin, maybe a bit of both
&gt; - I'm doing my damndest to eliminate some possibilities.  

You might want to track down how you could possibly be getting oil
INSIDE your exchangers. That sounds like a problem. If that's what's
happening, no amount of flushing out will work in the long run.
(Normally you'd have oil on the OUTSIDE of the boxes.)

&gt; Is there anything in particular I can service on my heater flaps while
&gt; they're nicely exposed?  Like, how can I make sure there is a good seal when
&gt; the flap is in the closed position? (in addition to good cable adjustment)

There's a little spring in there. Fiddle with that.
