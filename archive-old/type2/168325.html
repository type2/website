Subject: Sound Deadening

So I was looking back at an old discussion on sound deadening and Don
mentioned something about this stuff called Dynamat Clone to lessen the road
noise. I wanted to find out if anyone recently has done anything to combat
this that was fairly cost effective? Was it just small portions or big ones,
and where were the most effective places to put the stuff.

I have looked on eBay, and there are certainly enough copy-cats that claim
to do as well of a job, but I just wanted to know if any of you have done
things to better insulate and quite the inside of your buses.

Mahalo nui loa,

'75 2.0L Riviera Penthouse - Zoey

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
