Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2's get no respect... ;-(

&gt; Teri Hatcher says she &quot;absolutely did not have a VW van parked in her 
&gt; backyard for the sole purpose of hosting orgies...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; No, she used it to make a beer run, _then_ she had the orgy...


You guys are so mean, I think poor Teri should come to Oz where the bus 
community will give her the respect and friendship she deserves ( sorry 
Richard, you're taken, Teri will have to come to Sydney with me ;^)
