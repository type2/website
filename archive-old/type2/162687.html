&gt; 1973 camper bus, I just put a rebuilt subaru EA81 in it..
&gt;
&gt; I notice I can push down (toward ground) on rear (pulley) end of
&gt; engine, and the engine/tranny will rock (pivoting on transmission
&gt; rear mount, which is to frame)..
&gt;
&gt; I have a few options for my motor mounts...
&gt;
&gt; 1)rock rear of engine all the way DOWN, so nose of tranny is
&gt; all the way up.
&gt; 2)rock rear of engine all the way up, so nose of tranny is all
&gt; the way down
&gt; 3)somewhere between 1 and 2

you should set it so that the nose of the tranny would be at about the
same angle as it would be if a shifter linkage came out the front of the
tranny and had to line up with the gearshift lever

&gt; is it normal for the trans to rock like this, or am I gonna have to
&gt; replace the front trans mount?

it is normal for a half inch or so but not much, the front tranny mount on
an auto tranny is a flat piece of metal that slides into a rubber lined
box and it is pretty close fit, no space to speak of. not glove tight but
no slop either
