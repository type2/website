Subject: Re: [T2] CV dished washer

&gt; &gt; &gt; what's the deal with Bentley recommending to leave out the dished
&gt; washers on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the inside of CV joints??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have found there is no space for them. On occasion, some people have
&gt; &gt; forced them on and they have popped off the lock ring later.

I dont think its a problem of fitting, there is room. I think it gives the
cvs some axial play along the shaft, whereas the dished washer sort of
loads them against the c clip. I could guess why one is preferable but it
would only be a guess.
