Subject: Gas Guage question
Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2001 14:56:35 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

On the 71 Westy which I just bought the PO installed a second gas tank under
the rear seat which works fine with the gauge he installed in the blank spot
on the right of the speedo. My stock gas tank and gauge are not showing any
fuel. I have replaced the sender and still no joy. I'm not good at
electrical systems since with water I think in a straight line not in a loop
as with electricity. How can I test my gauge and sender to see which is bad.
Thanks,
Britt
