Well, hell Tex, er, Ed, if it is a place to start for someone else why
isn't a place to start for you??? If you hadn't pushed the motor to
failure, at least you might have a rebuildable core. Now you don't. It's
hard for me to imagine you can't find a good core in Texas that might run
halfway decent for a while. Since we can't find such a good deal anywhere
around here in the NW I figured you guys in the South were hording them
all. Surely someone on the list would know of any salvage yards in the Lone
Star State. You must have tried a web search??
