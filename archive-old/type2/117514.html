&gt; 2 questions.  I am getting terrible gas mileage on a 78 FI with automatic
&gt; transmission.  I am getting 14-17 mpg.  I have checked and adjusted the timing
&gt; and dwell, install new distributor cap and points.  What else could be a
&gt; culprit?  Usually travel 65 mph or less.

16 or so is about average around town, 18-19 on the road in a automatic

&gt; Second question, the check oil light has been on quite a bit.  I have just
&gt; changed oil and filter and strainer.  This am, it was blazing red for quite a
&gt; while, and then fluttered the remainder of the 100 mile trip.  Seems to me to
&gt; be an electrical gremlin but thought I would ask.

double check, you are probably right but you could have restricted oil
flow from a number of causes, that is affecting your oil presure enough
to cause the low oil presure but not enough to blow your engine, yet
