&gt; &gt; &gt; FWIW, 2 mos ago I installed a set of 225/75/15s and NOW my speedo is nutz
&gt; &gt; &gt; on, it always read too fast with the stock tires!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; right, the speedo is on the front left wheel the power is to the rear two
&gt; &gt; wheels, they are not really related, a tach would be more useful as would
&gt; &gt; a vacuum guage...
&gt; 
&gt; Im kind of assuming that these tires are on all 4 wheels.
&gt; In which case they are related.

right but since the gauges are not syncronized with the changes they are
behaviing differently  the speedo still thinks it has 185/14 tires while
the engine knows differently
