&gt; As I'm about to step back into the VeeDubbin thing with full force, and as
&gt; I just bought a house with a {alas...one car} garage, I'm going to be
&gt; needing some cool tools to use.  I've considered buying an air compressor,
&gt; but I wonder if power tools would be a better choice.  It seems to me that
&gt; apart from blowing things (which you're not supposed to do), painting
&gt; things and airing things up, there's not much you can do with a compressor
&gt; that you can't with 120vac.  The compressor would take up real estate, and
&gt; you'd still have to pay high dollar for quality tools.
&gt; 
&gt; Do compressor tools work that much better than electric tools?

Yes, and it's not just what you'd expect...

Take the auto polisher, for instance. They have electric ones and air ones,
and the electrics usually have a couple of fixed speeds. No just a little
faster or a little slower. An air powered polisher has an air valve--a
little faster or a little slower is just a matter of a little less or more
air.

I also like the die grinder for cutting things off. If you can do an
electric die grinder, I haven't seen one. (There may be such a thing, but so
far I haven't seen one.) Pneumatic die grinders are in most of the &quot;top ten
air tools&quot; packs.

Get good hoses and you're set.
