Subject: Re: [T2] What to do?

I'm about to pick up a 1958 Single Cab.  This will be my third bus.  I'd 
love to do a full resto, but I too lack space.  Until the time when I do 
have the physical resources, I'm going to enjoy the vehicle for what it 
is...a really cool, old car that is as much fun to look at and tinker with 
as it is to drive.
