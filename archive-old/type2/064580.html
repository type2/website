Subject: Push ro tube seals and carbs

Dear all,

Thankyou very much for all the info on pushrod tube seals.
I am reassured.  It is good to get so many different informed
comments. I only have one further query should you or should
you not use liquid gasket on the seals. I guess not but I've
been told it's good.

On the subject of carbs, I am not too sure if the UK type4s
ran the same carbs as the US, as you had much tighter emission
controls. My 1979 baywindow 1970cc runs 32-34 PDSIT 2-3 I do=20
not know the size of the jets. I would like a single dual
progressive weber as I am told the fuel consumption improves
terribly.

Dual solex carbs are expensive and hard to come buy. I did however
speak to someone at MEGABUG (Tel. 0181 317 7333), they are the
biggest VW breaker in th UK, and he had a pair sitting on a 1795cc,
he believes they are 34 PDSIT 2-3. He wants =A3100 (thats pounds sterling)
for the pair without the manifolds but with all the linkage etc.

Yours gratefully

Mick
