Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

Prior to the development
&gt; of the highway system, population centers were cities...Came the highways
&gt; and cars and the population sprawled out to the suburbs and now even ex-
&gt; urbs.

As late as about 1957 we still had a wonderful public transportation system
in Los Angeles and surrounding cities.. the &quot;Red Car&quot; system. I remember it
very well, even though I was very little then. It was like the San Francisco
cable cars, but it moved on rails and was energized by an overhead network
of electrically charged cables. You could go a lot of places on the Red
Cars, from the LA harbor to downtown LA and beyond.. But with the advent of
automobiles in every garage, it all disappeared. Jan B
