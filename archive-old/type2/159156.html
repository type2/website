Subject: Steering Wheel Cover

Hi All -

	recently:

 &gt;&gt; I found a molded steering wheel cover for $10 to fit our busses at a truck
 &gt;&gt; stop in CO. 18&quot; (they have 20&quot; ones too that were only $8) and fits the 78
 &gt;&gt; perfectly! What is it made of???


 &gt; Genuine artificial simulated imitation plastic leather-grain effect
 &gt;	- waddya expect for $10?


These recent comments prompt me to write that I recently sprang for GoWesty's 
$35 WheelSkins specific size cover for my loaf and am delighted with it's fit 
and function.
http://www.gowesty_dot_com  - search for 'Steering Wheel Wrap'

It took me a full two hours to stitch it on, really cinching it up per 
instructions and even then got one out of synch.  And you need to stay cognizant 
of the stitching path, keeping it aligned with the indentations on the bottom of 
the wheel so that to the touch it's completely uniform, without the teeny ridge.

Once it's on, it looks and feels just like factory.  Really a sweet upgrade, and 
keeps the wheel grip much cooler in hot temps.

Nick
