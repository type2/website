Subject: [T2] re:  '76 FI Bus running poorly/stalling

Happy Friday all!
My poor '76 FI Bus when warmed up wishes to stall out.	It smells like it's
flooding.  Idle is properly set, vacuum lines tested, new fuel filter, new
lines, new &amp; tight enough fan belt.  I have been told that this may be
problem with my alternator as my lights all flicker when at idle or highway
speed.
If anyone can find the time, please help.  I have Muir's book, Haynes
manual &amp; finally Bently too.
I as well wanted to help all those on the list who put up with my endless
completely bus-virgin questions (especially kind Karl).  I hope to repay
everyone by continuing to pass on this knowledge.
Happy weekend all!
