Richard:

I've been thinking about trying the synthetic route. 
Since you've done it I have a few concerns maybe you
could help with

How cold does it get where you are?  Do you think the
5W50 work in the real/real cold?

I have pesky leaks on the valve covers that wont go
away.  DO I need to make it leak proof prior to
changing?

Thanks
Logan
