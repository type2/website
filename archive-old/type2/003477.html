X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I have a new set of dual 34's for a Type IV engine for sale.  I want to put
them on Ebay, but thought I would offer them to the list first.

Hex bar linkage, air cleaners, manifolds, all included......_dot_used larger
carbs on a project instead of these.

I have $350 in them, and hope to get reasonable offers for them!!  Pmail
with interest.
