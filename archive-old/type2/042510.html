Subject: FI ohms and volts

Hi all-

I've been mostly lurking on the list for a few months now, replying to
an occasional post when I happen to know an answer to a question.  By
way of introduction, I've been the happy owner of a '79 CA Westy for 12
years (since I was 23, for those keeping track).  This has been a
workhorse bus, serving as my daily driver and my field vehicle when I go
out on biology research trips.  Add in the fact that I haven't had a
garage to keep her in and it adds up to a pretty hard life.  Soon though
I'll have a garage and driveway of my very own, so I'll finally be able
to keep her in the style she deserves.  I'll also be doing a lot of work
on her, so expect loads of questions from me in the near future.

On to the actual subject of the post - not too long ago, someone was
kind enough to post a link to a scan of a diagram showing the
resistances and voltages of the FI system (all on one page).  I printed
it out at the time, but misplaced the page and can't find the original
message either.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks,
Alistair
