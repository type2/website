I got it running! It was the timing, and I also replaced the points.
I still can't see why taking the dizzy off will affect this (it is
a Type 4 engine, therefore the clamp remained in place). Boy, was I
pleased to hear the purr of the engine as it ran. Unfortunately I
am here completely without timing data, so I set it static 0°. I'm
going home to get the manual, I think the 2 litre is set at 35° BTDC
at 3000rpm or so?

So, the lesson is, check the obvious.
