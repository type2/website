Subject: Re: [T2] New Mr Heater portable buddy says NO inside use.

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Courtney
&gt; Something happened, because all of a sudden it is NOT to be used indoors,
&gt; and the manual has the big X-out sign over the icon of a truck, tent, and
&gt; camper. The unit looks identical to all the others I've seen, but all of a
&gt; sudden no indoor use. Lawyers going to town again you think? Now my wife is
&gt; worried about it.

Do as you wish.. but remember to be careful out there!

That sort of echo's what the archives say..

Fred Stoermer from  Tacoma, WA used to be pretty vocal on the list about the SAR
that would turn up people that had suffocated from lack of oxygen in confined
spaces due to the heater using the oxygen in the air..

I personally don't like the heaters that glow red inside a volkswagen ...
because the way *I* use them,,, and I know it will damage something ,, by melted
radient heat, or by fire with direct contact... or worse ,, by death if I fall
asleep .
I have paper towels.. plates.. newspapers.. pillows, blankets,, etc. that ,,, by
murphy's law,, must come in contact with something that is hot ..

I know there are folks who use them without problem.

To each their own... myself,,, I havn't found anything that works safe except
electric.  OR a real furnace style heater.
The electric heater of my personal fav.

There is a Webasto [air] heater* from the trucking industry that can be
converted to gas burning instead of diesel.. and uses a standard wall thermostat
to keep you volkswagen nice and warm... much less battery consumption than the
Espar Eberspacher heaters...
*as opposed to coolant heater...
Trouble is finding one... for the price you want to pay..  The DBG guys in WI
use them , they located them at truck wrecking yards... iirc

The actual diesel fired air heater used in the unit described below claims to
use less than two gallons of fuel per week during the winter in Colorado.. I
would be tempted to leave it diesel fired.. it is probably expensive .
These people have an interesting opinion,,

Propane is a potentially dangerous substance. Since propane is heavier than air,
if a propane leak develops in an RV the propane can accumulate at the bottom of
the camper until an ignition source ignites it. An open propane cooking flame in
the relatively tight space of a camper is also a risk. It can be easy to
accidentally ignite a paper towel or paper plate with an open propane flame in
the relatively tight space of a camper. Additionally, a gallon of propane only
has about 65% of the energy content of a gallon of diesel fuel, so much more
propane must be carried to get the same energy content as diesel fuel-a waste of
both space and energy.

Reliance on propane can cause many annoyances. When propane is burned, one of
the byproducts is water vapor, which contributes to excessive humidity and
condensation inside the camper. When traveling on most ferries (including Alaska
Marine Highway and British Columbia ferries) propane tanks must be sealed
closed. RVs that depend on propane for refrigeration will have no refrigeration
while on these ferries. Propane can be difficult to find in remote areas, and
it's difficult to top off a partially full tank.


here is another interesing read,, but I am sure,, not the solution..
