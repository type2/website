Subject: Re: [T2] brake help needed!

Have you tried putting stock lug wrench on lugs, parallel with the ground. 
Then stand on it and lightly jump up and down,  dont know how smart it is 
but has worked for me.

&gt; &gt; I cannot for the life of me
&gt; &gt; get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this 
&gt;random
&gt; &gt; shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts 
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Should I run buy one of those cross shaped lugwrenches, so I get more
&gt; &gt; leverage and hopefully then will be able to bust them loose, or do I 
&gt;need to
&gt;
&gt;get a piece of pipe and slide over the wrench you have and break it loose
&gt;
&gt; &gt; wait till tuesday to find a shop someplace with an airgun where they can
&gt; &gt; break them free for me?
&gt;
&gt;yeah and NEVER let em put your lug nuts on with an airgun, I will hand em
&gt;my spinner lug wrench and tell em to put em on with that...figure if they
&gt;put em on with it I can get it off
&gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was 
&gt;made
&gt;
&gt;been there done that, pouring rain at night, finally had to &quot;borrow&quot; a
&gt;piece of a farmers fence to use as a breaker bar...not fun
