Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy tent plastic clips - what to use if broken?

From: &quot;Joe Clark&quot; &lt;jclark_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;
&gt; If you think about who would have spare OEM clips (ie, someone who found a
wasted tent and scrounged them), I think you'll realize there are likely
&gt; only two chances, one of which is &quot;slim&quot;.
&gt; The S-hooks will do the job just fine and no one will ever notice except
you.

Ah... well, yes... but I was actually thinking of looking it over (the web
diagrams aren't very detailed) to see if I could add it to the number of
VW-related masters sitting on the work table next to me at this moment.

I'm currently doing a long mirror mount which should fit both the
bayonet-style and the screw-style mounts, and a set of the red/blue heater
lever handles.  I'd look into doing the older-style heater levers, but I
don't have access to them at present, just a picture in a manual.

I test fitted one of my repro heater levers last night, and it fit
perfectly.  I just need to finish the masters and create new molds.

So, if anyone has a clip they'd let slip, I'm hip.  And that ain't no lip.
:O)
