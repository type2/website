This is not that hard a job, just went through it with my '70 westy. Usual
suspects, went to replace leaking wheel cylinders and brakes, noticed boots
were torn may as well replace those too, and o ya whats that drip from the
trans. If you need to replace the seal you'll need to drop the cv on that
side. In my case I pulled the axles as units to clean and repack the cv's and
change boots (your already onyour back so you may as well do the whole job
right). Here is the only difficult part, my trans is a 68 in a 70 westy so its
a little diff than yours but not much, after dropping the cv you need to pull
the flange. The flange is held on with a circlip hidden behind a cap. Drive a
screwdriver thru the cap and pull it off, don't worry you replace the cap
w/new for a buck or two. The circlip needs a reverse plier or a circlip plier
to remove. You can make one by grinding down a flat spot on a old pair of
needlenose pliers. In your case remove the lockplate which then give you
access to the seal. Pull the seal, being careful not to scrape the seal
surface, I use a pick meant for the job. Clean every thing up (a clean seal is
a happy seal) When you install the new seal oil up both seal surfaces and
gently drive the seal in making sure it's square. I use a fork seal driver but
a socket the same size will do. Assembly is the reverse. Note, when you remove
the bolts for the cv's, take the time to clean out each head so your socket
can get a grip without stripping. Never had it happen but I've heard it's a
real PITA to pull a stripped bolt. In my case there is now one more junkyard
queen almost hwy ready. It might not be a split, but the more busses on the
road the better.Sorry this ran long buts it not really that hard a job.
