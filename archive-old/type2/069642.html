Subject: Eberspacher for sale

I've got an Eberspacher BN-4 for sale.  It works really well, and I'd 
rather not part with it, but my wife is expecting, and since we'll 
need a warm car for the winter (the heater puts out a lot of warmth, 
but it can't seem to keep up with the holes or the bad 
rubber around the sliding door.), the bus is becoming a summer only 
item.  Hence, no need for the heater.  In the future, maybe I can 
afford to buy another, but right now, we need the cash.  So 
anyhow, thats the story.  Any interest?  If not, I'll offer it to the 
local market here.  I'm asking $350 obo.  

Thanks!
