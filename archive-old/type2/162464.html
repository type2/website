&gt; How does this differ from Japanese/US models with similar sticker
&gt; prices that have several engine options available to the buyer?

it is the same, go to Japan there are many many more models avaliable in
Japan than are imported to the USA.

&gt; You're suggesting that VW made undesirable models to begin with but

VW brings to the USA those models that sell, the van was brought to the
USA (barely advertised) with an outrageous sticker and didn't sell. why
should they bring it.


However considering how many &quot;Sprinter's&quot; I see running around I don't
understand why the T-5 van is not brought to the USA.

&gt; Maybe the Type 4 engine would have grown to 2.3L before aircooled
&gt; engines choked on their own emissions...

the type 4 engine was very competent in a 412, my wife drove a 1974 412
square back and loved it, ran well and reliably.  one of the reasons I
wasn't afraid of buying my curret 1978 bus, I was familiar with the engine
and comfortable with maintaining it.
