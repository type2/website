Subject: Re: [T2] No 4 Ways

Post the numbers on the m code plate behind the drivers seat. It is 
likely that this bus was delivered by VW to the European market where 
lighting regs varied from country to country. For instance in France 
headlights were yellow. In Italy turn signals where white instead of 
orange.


&gt;         Does anyone know if Buses were ever delivered with no 4 ways? My
&gt;friends 71 doesn't even have a switch for them. No original hole in the dash
&gt;where the switch would go either.
&gt;Also there are no back-up lights. The signals are where the back-up lights
&gt;should be (mounted horizontally above the tail lights). The tail lights look
&gt;stock.(brake lights and driving lights). Seems strange to me. Are there
&gt;anymore buses out there like this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
