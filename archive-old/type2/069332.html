Subject: Paint code location

Can somwone please tell me where the paint code would be located on my 81
vanagon. I have a code but when I went to the VW shop to buy some touchup,
the color that I would describe as yellow is officially &quot;ivory&quot;. That makes
me question the code I had written down so I would like to verify it before
actually ordering the last three bottles of this color in the east coast VW
system.

Thanks,

Weston
