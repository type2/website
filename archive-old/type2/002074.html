I have struggled several times to remove the CV joint/half shaft retainer
clips...all the snap ring pliers I have found won't do the job - until - in
desperation one night I took a small pair (about 5 inches long) of SS
medical clamps - these are the kind you see in the O.R. of MASH, &quot;nurse -
clamp, sponge, crescent wrench&quot;...anyway, these 'clamps' look like small
scissors with blunt tips to clamp things and to hold a needle for stitches,
they have notched locking tangs near the finger holes.

I ground the tips on my bench grinder so that they would fit the holes in
the snap rings and they worked like a charm!...The distance from the pivot
pin and the ends of the 'pliers' is only about an inch - so you can get
great leverage - most of the store bought snap ring pliers are built with
over 2 inches here and just don't work for these CV snap rings.

With this home modification, these 'pliers' lift the rings on and off like
they were built just for this job...try it, you'll like it - I found mine at
a flea market one day, and I think I'll get some more next time I see them.
