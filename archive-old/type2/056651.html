hi volks, i have finally managed to get at my fuel tank. this is not easy
without removing the transmission. there were 2 screws i could not see or get
at, i ended up tearing them out. once removed i found the cause of my smelly
car when full, a torn 90 degree hose coming out of the rear of the tank.
question: i have the little vent tubes coming from the tank, they go up into
the rear quarterpanels and the to the motor area. once there they go nowhere
and are not connected. could i do away with all this and simply connect them
together or block them off? i still have a bigger pipe going to the filler
neck for the tank to breathe.
thanks, marty :)
