Tried one, they won't even clear the windshield very well below 50=B0 F.

About the only way you will get warm is to stuff it in your pocket...=20
(Don't do this either, you'll catch your clothes on fire).

Get the factory heater to 100% efficiency. I have a friend with a bus like=
=20
this. It will keep you warm if the weather is above freezing. Below that=20
you'll have to get creative.

Realistically the only electric heat that will do you any good is the 12=20
volt electric blankets or any of the electric heat clothing that us=20
motorcyclists use.

Many good things electric to wear in your bus in the motorcycle and=20
snowmobile catalogs. That way you heat you and not the air in your bus.

&gt;I may have missed the original post.  But here goes;  The other day at
&gt;Advance Auto I saw a 12v ceramic heater that looked like it would be good

 least
&gt;trying it if I ev er get my Bus going.

&gt; &gt; I think I am waiting for the resurgence of electric cars, or even the
&gt; &gt; hybrids, they will need decent heat to sell in the northern parts of the
&gt; &gt; world

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was out nosing around the WEB (imagine that:-) and
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought to take a look at what kit plane owners might
&gt; &gt; &gt; use to heat themselves.  I happened across this link
&gt; &gt; &gt; and was wondering if anyone else had had any
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience with this sort of thing:

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lemme' know
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thinking outside the box,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Brian
