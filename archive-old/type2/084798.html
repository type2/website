Subject: Re: [T2] coil-over shocks

Charles wrote:

&gt;Every time this coil-over subject comes up, it provokes several responses 
&gt;so I will summarize the results of the last discussion: a half dozen or so 
&gt;list members responded that they had used the coil-over shocks and were 
&gt;very pleased, 8-10 list members with no first-hand experience whatsoever 
&gt;weighed in that they though using coil-overs was a bad idea, only one list 
&gt;member with real first-hand experience responded in the negative.

I'd like to add that VW used coil-over shocks on the rear suspension 
for Buses with higher load capacity. I've only seen them on a Kemperinck 
stretched single cab I once had.
