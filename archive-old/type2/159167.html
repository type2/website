Before you look into more expensive options, have you confirmed that the 
offensive part is the clutch? Several other parts can cause a 
transmission not go into gear, including the shifter missadjustments, 
loose shifter rod parts or bushings. Worth a look at the very least.

&gt; What can I expect to pay to have some one fix my clutch?

I don't have a price, but you will be paying for a Removal and 
replacement of the engine which should be a good chunk of change. If 
possible it's a great oppertunity for a bus owner to get the feel for 
R&amp;R by doing it yourself. Should be a reasonable job over a weekend, 
with the most basic tools.
