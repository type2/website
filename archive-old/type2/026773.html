Exactly what I was goin' to say.  I also put a VERY thin film of anti-seize 
on the hub where it touches the drum so that next time it will come off 
easier.  Not too much as you don't want it melting onto your drum or shoes 
(lubricated brakes don't stop a bus very well).
Have Fun,
Ted

&gt;Spray a small amount of penetrant around the circle formed by the gap
&gt;between the hub and composite drum. Lay the bus on it's side for proper
&gt;penetration ;-)  These can be a mutha' to remove sometimes.  Hit it where 
&gt;it
&gt;mates with the hub. You need a plastic or rawhide mallet or better yet some
&gt;careful taps on the drum at the hub with an air hammer...it'll come off.
&gt;There's a more brutal way involving physics with the two bolts removed, but
&gt;try this first.
