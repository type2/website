Subject: Re: Hagerty Insurance

&gt;I just tried to get insurance for my 1977 Westy which
&gt;is garaged for the winter, we said there was no gas
&gt;hooked up in it, and they declined to insure. Anyone
&gt;else have this problem?

Allstate lets me carry what they call &quot;suspended insurance&quot; on any
vehicle. It costs $70 a  year per vehicle, and I can drive it for four
days each month, so I get to 'stretch its legs' on those decent winter
days. The comprehensive stays active, in case something falls on it,
someone takes out a window, but the liability is only active for those
four days when I drive it around.

When the weather improves, I put the full coverage back on, and when 
winter comes around, I switch it back to &quot;suspended&quot; Four days still gets
me one good camping trip a month, which ain't bad.

The biggest PITA around here is all vehicles on the property much be
registered and insured, or its off to the impound if any points it out, so
its either something like this suspended insurance, or liability year
round even if its parked and I am rebuilding the motor, or just too poor
to drive it. 

I would like to hear from those who are using Good Sam, or other such
carriers, as to how much it costs. Probably doesn't apply to a straight
vanagon, but it still sounds intriguing, and I would like to know more
from those who have experienced it. 

Thanks in advance.

John
