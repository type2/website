Subject: Input shaft seal

I think I found a replacement for the 091 input shaft seal (001 301 227D).

I lrecently located a 013 301 227 seal from Sabo for a Passat/Gol (Brazil
models). The seal package says it's 15x24x7 which matches the dimensions of
the Elring original:

I found it at www.importecparts_dot_com part # J1162-52304.

If you've never shopped there they have some pretty smoking deals. I buy all
the parts for my wife's Acura there. For example:

F1020-14179 Bosch spark plug wires $20.99
F1020-12599 Beru for $19.73

They also sell the resistor connectors for the end ( F1010-13365 and
F1010-13363) but for the price of 4 you might as well buy a set of wires for
$1 more.

Free ship over $50 and no tax unless you live in Texas. For Bay Area folks
their warehouse (Worldpac) is located in Newark. Parts ordered by 11:30am
PST arrive at my door in 24 hours.
