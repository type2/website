Subject: high altitude problems

Howdy volks,

On my recent travels, I was in Breckenridge, CO. I
wanted to return in the next month or so (since there
wasn't any snow yet when I was there in Nov.) The main
pass is at 11,000ft...a we were slowly chugging up the
mountain.

Here's my issue: I have a 75 Westy with a 78 2000cc
engine with a Weber Progressive carb. It seems as
though the carb is icing up. When I was stuck on the
way out of high country, I called Jason on the AIRS
list. He recommended (since I had a temp gauge) to
lean up the mixture as low as I could and turn up the
idle. This is the only thing that saved us. We were
just extremely lucky that there was no snow along the
road, since we were riding on the shoulder through the
switchbacks without our new adjustment.

So, has anyone found another way of correcting my
problem? The intake from the carb was ice cold when I
touched it.

I want to return to high country for some snowboarding
in Feburary and I'm afraid of returning due to this
problem...especially since there will be piles of snow
on the shoulder when I return. I just want a sure fire
way to adjust and/or fix the engine before heading
back up to high altitude and extra cold air.

Thanks so much guys!
Missy:)
