Update on the '80 Westi's, Cal Look or not.

Both are the same model, the &quot;L&quot; model.
Both have the same camper stuff, including propane/stove.
The Cal Look one originally came with a CA equipped engine,
the other was a non-CA equipped one, but I recently saw another '80 L 
Westi that was identical to my non-CA one but with a CA engine, and 
that got me to thinking (boy, is that ever dangerous, see what 
*stuff* I can come up with!)  It's hard to tell, but the logo's on 
the back seem to be all black too, without the silver highlights on 
the lettering (the other 80s' has almost faded away).

&gt; Well, the bumpers and all sound like the ones on my Kombi, so they are
&gt; probably the base model stuff -- not an &quot;extra&quot;.  My '80 Westy has all
&gt; the chrome, but it's a GL model.  One I saw at the CCC's was a base
&gt; model camper (also no stove/propane) with trim like you describe (actually,
&gt; I thought they had black bumpers with black rubber strips, though).
&gt; 
&gt; Was yours the L or GL model?
