Subject: Re: [T2] 12V HEATERS

What?  you did not like hot air from the engine coming into the cab?

That is fresh air pushed across those ceramic pieces and into the cab.the
heat is transferred from the exhaust pipe, thru the ceramic, to the air that
is going to the cab......_dot_millions of cars used this process, it is not
dangerous.

It is only dangerous if you have a greasy old motor that has no engine seal,
leaky exhaust, and or no continuity of the fresh heated air tube from the
back of the car to the front.  Then, and only then, are you forcing smoky,
CO filled air into the cabin.

Gas heaters are great, but are really not made to run constantly to heat
your car.  Their is a club called the KC Kombis that has a seminar on tape
you can buy.

Hi y'all,

Just wondering if anyone has ever put in a 12V heater in their Van?
I have a 72 van as some of you know but I recently tore out the old heater
boxes
around the mufflers. i didn't like the idea of having the hot air from the
engine coming into the cab.
plus if any oil spills near those heater boxes you have a chance of breathin
in the bad air.
so anyway thats why i'm wonderin about the option of a 12V heater....._dot_cause
winters comin soon.
Darren , the Canadian guy.
