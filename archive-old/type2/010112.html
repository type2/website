Hi Again --
I've been scouring the archives for a consensus on the proper/safest place
to position jack stands when lifting a bus.  (I had mine fall off a jack
yesterday -- I wasn't under it -- and just went out and bought some new
stands.)  I've seen three recurring spots:  torsion tube, torsion tube
housing, and torsion bar.  Can anyone pinpoint this, and maybe even try to
describe the exact spot?  There's a lot of hardware under there, most of
which I'm still learning to identify.  Thank you!
