&gt; Also has anyone tried using the 205 (27&quot; diamater) tires? I believe I had
&gt; them on Spiffy a few years ago, but it's been so long I can't remember if I
&gt; was running 195's or 205. I do remember the guy telling me that the tires I
&gt; ordered were not the stock size, but the Bridgestone's handled great and I
&gt; was very happy with them. And although this should be the least important
&gt; item...those oversized tires really looked good and helped to make the bus
&gt; look more proportionate. I hate the dinky tires on my large bus.

I have been running 205/70R14 tires for over 10 years on my buses (not
same tires) and love the way they handle and look. little hard to steer at
slow speeds but other than that.  can't remember ever hitting the
wheelwell but there isn't any spare space either.

I have Michelin MXT's on all four corners.  not sure how well they show up
in the photos but Gregg has some on the 2002 John Browns Buses link that
look pretty good.  still running the same tires,  I wanted an agressive
M&amp;S tread because mine is a year round daily driver and I ski so get to
drive in a bit of snow each year tooo.
