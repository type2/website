Subject: Back on the list, slight problem

I'm back after a couple of months' absence.  My mailbox got really fiull 
during a trip to Florida and apparently I got bumped.  Been really busy this 
summer and haven't had time to get on the computer much.  I subscibed via the 
digest mode a week or so ago and I've been lurking some.  
Good news is part of why I'm so busy is that I've really been getting a 
chance to use the (78) Westy a good bit this year.  Best VW I've ever had.
Since I got it a couple of years ago, I've noticed that a lifter would 
occasionally bleed off after sitting for a while and take a little while to 
pump up.  No big deal.
Well, now it won't pump up.  I'm in the middle of several projects right now, 
and I want to use the bus this fall for some foliage tours and camping, so my 
question is... Will it hurt anything to drive it this way?  I'm sure it's a 
lifter, and the bus runs great, and this is my first hydraulic lifter flat 
four.  Am I doing damage to the engine driving it this way?  I'll probably 
put another 1500 miles or so on it before the snow flies and it gets parked 
for the winter.  Hopefully then I'll have time to do something about it, but 
for now I'd like to use it as long as it doesn't hurt the engine.
Recommendations?
Also, has anyone camped at the Seneca Rocks State Park campground in West 
Virginia?  Good? Bad?  I'd like to get down that way sometime this fall and 
I'll probably stay there.
Thanks, and it's good to be back.
