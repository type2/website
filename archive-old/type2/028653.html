This is very disturbing to me.

I think there should be a better registration
process to be allowed to communicate via this
list serve. Like Full name, address, etc.
So that the list could be better used as a source
of information.

If it's someone on this listserve that is
involved,
they should come foreward and face their
responsibilities.
This should be a warning!

Don't travle alone and personally, I would never
stop at a rest stop. There are State Parks all
over
the country where people are required to register
their names and vehicles. That is a much safer
place
to stay the night.


Here is the full and very sad story from the
Associated Press.


Woman stabbed, killed at rest stop
Associated Press
Monday, August 28, 2000

MORRILTON (AP) -- A woman found stabbed to death
at an
Interstate 40 rest stop had told her mother she
planned
to stop somewhere and sleep in her van, the
sheriff says.

The woman was identified Monday as Kristin Ann
Laurite,
25, of Scotch Plains, N.J., said Sheriff Mark
Flowers.
The woman's nude body was found on the bank of a
pond
near the rest stop near Morrilton.

The woman had told her mother Friday afternoon
that she
planned to stop somewhere and sleep in her van,
Flowers
said. She was on her way to California when she
stopped
in Conway County.

A truck driver found the woman's dogs running
loose late
Saturday and called a phone number listed on the
dog tags,
Flowers said. The truck driver reached the woman's
mother,
who said something must be wrong because the dogs
never strayed.

State police and the sheriff's office searched the
area.
The dogs led officers to the woman's body.

The sheriff said there are no leads in the case.

In January 1997, truck driver Arthur Joe Cotton,
71, of Sheridan,
was found with a bullet in his head in the
bathroom of the I-40
rest stop at Morrilton. Two half-brothers from
West Virginia
were convicted of the murder.

I got a phone call at work this morning from the
Conway County,
Arkansas Sherrif's Department asking if I had
worked on a woman's
'71 bus on Thursday or Friday. She was found dead
in a rest area
on I-40 near Conway. Apparently she was having
some trouble with
her bus on a cross country trip and someone she
knew had given
her my name from the AIRS list. I didn't get a
call from her.
The investigators are looking for any information
they can get
on this case. If you know anything at all about a
25 year old
woman traveling West on I-40 in a '71 bus with two
dogs, please
contact Cleve Keeling at (501) 354-2411.

I hope this isn't the first notice of this to any
of her friends.
I know the family has been notified. My sincere
condolences to
family and friends.
