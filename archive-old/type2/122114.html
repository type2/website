Subject: Hot Wheel

Hi Gang,

My recent rear brake rebuild has left me with a lingering problem...the 
right wheel drum is always much hotter than the left after driving. I 
thought this might be due to uneven braking, but it feels symeterical. I 
also rolled to a stop after a long highway run, without using any brakes at 
at all, and the right hub was very hot. The stub axle seems pretty cool, so 
I don't think it's a bearing. There is also some rustlike particles on the 
wheel that I don't think were there before.

When I jack the bus up, the wheel rotates freely, smoothly, and with no 
noise or dragging...

Any ideas where the heat might be coming from?

TIA,
RickG
