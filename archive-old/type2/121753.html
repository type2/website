Subject: Re: [T2] Van will start...20 seconds later it dies by
  itself?????

&gt;She starts.  I step on the accelerator to let her warm up and then 
&gt;the engine dies on its own from 2000 rpm to 0 in 5 secs.  Eventually 
&gt;the engine will start again and run fine until unpredictably the 
&gt;problems occurs again.

Are you running a Pertronix unit?  I had a very similar problem in my 73
that I suffered through for 2 winters.  Finally, after replacing virtually
every FI piece with either a new one or a known-good one I replaced the
distributor which had a Pertronix in it and the problem went away.  Maybe it
was the distributor, maybe it was the Pertronix.  I've never tried that
dizzy again without the Pertronix so I can't say for sure...
