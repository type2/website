There is a web site out there somewhere that a guy took a bus and made a
trailer from it. I have been looking for it but can't find it the bus name
is (Double Deuce) it is real cool. He painted it to match.

&gt; I would look for a low profile roof that is the same height or shorter
than
&gt; your roofline.  Also, a two wheel axle is all you will need.  As far as
&gt; construction material?  Wood is cheaper than sheet metal which is cheaper
&gt; than Aluminum.  Some people build trailers from kits.  I've seen a guy
&gt; pulling a half bug behind his TRIKE.  Coolest VW trailer I've ever seen.
If
&gt; you are feeling creative make one!!
&gt;
&gt; As far a hitches go, I use a 2&quot; ball on my factory hitch.  Maybe U-Haul or
&gt; the likes can install an aftermarket type receiver.  I haven't looked into
&gt; that, but I know they install them on just about everything.  Be careful
as
&gt; you don't want some non VW mechanic to weld something that prevents you
from
&gt; dropping the engine..

&gt; &gt; What should one look for in a trailer and hitch for a bus?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am an avid overpacker, and a trailer is just what I need!  Not too
&gt; &gt; large and as light as possible.  I'm looking in my local paper's online
&gt; &gt; classifieds, and not seeing any trailers...  Their indexing system
&gt; &gt; sucks.
