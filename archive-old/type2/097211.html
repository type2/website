Jeff:

As always, there's a &quot;range&quot; of answers to all of your questions.  If you're
in the &quot;I love this car, I'm going to drive it forever and I have unlimited
money&quot; camp then there's one set of answers, and if you're in the &quot;I'm
broke, I just want to get this thing running and sell it to the next fool&quot;
camp there's another.  So...

Subject: [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (long)


&gt; Hi All:
&gt;
&gt; I have some questions regarding rebuilding the top end of my 82 Vanagon
&gt; 2.0L air cooled engine. Images related to my questions can be found at
&gt; http://www.cs.fiu_dot_edu/~jstric01/images/VW/WEB_VW_Images.html .
&gt;
&gt; The van dropped an intake valve seat on #1 cylinder when I was doing
&gt; compression testing in the driveway. Very lucky. The van/engine has only
&gt; 51K miles on the original engine.
&gt;
&gt; My questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is it common for the VW heads to drop seats this easily? I was hoping
&gt; to just replace the one head as the compression is fine on the other.

It happens.

&gt; 2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?

If the engine was really the original engine and basically sound, and you
just happened to catch a bad head, then I'd say &quot;Yes, it's OK.&quot;  I'd
probably opt for having the head rebuilt by a good rebuilder, but you could
also buy a new AMC head, though some folks believe it's not good to mix VW
and AMC heads.  Big money answer: pull both heads and send them off for a
rebuild.

&gt; 3. Any suggestions (sources) for a good cheap pair of ring clamps for
&gt; VW's?

Bus Depot and other online vendors have them.


&gt; 4. I have never honed a cylinder. Is this necessary if I keep the
&gt; existing rings? Or should I just replace the rings. Will a shop hone the
&gt; cylinders? I was originally trying to not have to remove the cylinders,
&gt; but to clean the area, adjust the deck height, I will have to remove
&gt; them. Anything i should be careful of? Where does one get new shims to
&gt; to adjust for machining of the cylinder heads? Does Bus Depot or some
&gt; other list vendor sell these? Where is a good source for VW cylinder
&gt; hone tool?

Because of the way VW cylinders wear it's generally considered a waste of
time to hone them.  They wear somewhat egg-shaped and you can't hone them
round.  No bucks answer: leave everything in place, get the rebuilt head and
slap it on.  Assuming the rebuilder doesn't have to do a serious compression
cut (or, if you get an AMC head) then CR's shouldn't be materially changed
from what they were &quot;at the factory&quot; and you'll get by.  Let the next owner
worry about it.  Big bucks answer:  Pull the P&amp;C's and get new.  CC the
heads.  Get the shims you need from Bus Depot or Cal Imports or some other
VW FLAPS.
&gt;
&gt; 5. If I replace the rings, what happens if I do this on only one side?
&gt; Will this unbalance the engine?

See #4.  Unless you know something you're not telling us, I would think the
rings on a 51K original engine would be fine, so I'm not sure why you're
thinking about doing this.

&gt; 6. In the process of dropping the seat, the valve put a small ding in
&gt; the piston. Should I worry about this?

If I was just getting this engine back together for the next owner, then I
wouldn't.  If I was *slightly* more concientious, then I'd gently &quot;round&quot;
the sharp edges of the ding with some very fine sandpaper before putting the
engine back together.

&gt; 7. I notice a lot of carbon deposits under the valve cover and past the
&gt; cylinder head seal. In addition the seal on # 1 cylinder was warped.
&gt; This indicates that the valves and cylinder were leaking. The worst
&gt; carbon deposits are on #2 cylinder. It's seal looked fine. What causes
&gt; this and how do I avoid the problem when I rebuild the engine?

This engine may have been seriously overheated at some point in its life.
The new AMC heads have the seal &quot;built in&quot; to the head, which probably is a
better way of going.  VW itself recommended doing away with the seal at some
point and placing all shims between the case and cylinder.

&gt; 8. When I had adjusted the valves (about 300 miles before problem) the
&gt; lifters appeared soft. Looking at the lifters they look almost
&gt; brand-new? They have been in the car for 20 years. Should I 1) bother
&gt; trying to rebuild the lifters (clean them) and then purge the air, 2)
&gt; just purge the air, or 3) buy new ones?

Your picture doesn't really show the important part of the lifter: the
contact point between the lifter and the cam.  Good lifters have a somewhat
&quot;rounded&quot; contact face while worn lifters are much more flat faced.  Try and
get a look at the cam lobes for wear.  They tend to wear in such a way that
the lobe gets &quot;notched&quot; right on its high point.  Any serious notching means
it's new cam and new lifters time.  Low, low bucks answer: put them back in
the bores they came out of.  Slightly more concientious: disassemble, clean,
bleed.  A little more bucks: New lifters, though they're not going to live
long if the cam is worn.  Big bucks: you know.

&gt; 9. The neighborhood we live in gives us problems if they see a car
&gt; disabled. They threatened to have the van towed when I was replacing the
&gt; gas tank. A tight budget means that I must do the work myself here. Thus
&gt; I have stripped the tin, exhaust, etc. with the engine in the car to
&gt; remove the problem cylinder. Other than making this task slightly more
&gt; difficult, is there any other reason why I can't complete the repair
&gt; with the engine in the car?

What's the &quot;problem cylinder?&quot;  I thought this was a head problem, mainly.
Well, since you've taken the head off with the engine in the car, it seems
like you can put it back.

&gt; 10. Any reason why I can't replace the intake and exhaust studs with
&gt; stainless to avoid the problems with rust I had when removing them? Will
&gt; the aluminum heads corrode faster? Where could I get stainless studs?

Don't know.  I've always used generous amount of anti-seize on the stock
studs and have managed to get them on and off OK.

&gt; 11. The cylinder head studs and heads were rusty. Should these or all
&gt; the studs be replaced? In the future what is the best way to lock the
&gt; studs into the case so that they do not come out when I am trying to
&gt; just take of the head?

Unless the studs were damaged I'd chase the threads, clean them up and
re-install them with a little Permatex gasket sealer on the threads.
