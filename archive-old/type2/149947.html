&gt; That would be a broken break line I believe.

It is a broken brake line.

It is not a big deal, you need a metric (10mm) bubble flare brake line and a
way to bend it to the correct shape. The length is about 9&quot; long, IIRC. You
will also need a flare wrench to re and re the line. Normal spanners do not
work properly on brake lines. Ready-made lines are usually available at auto
parts stores, but chances are it will be too long, I think the shortest one
they have is 12&quot;. You have two choices, either use it as it and bend it to
suit, or buy a double-flare tool and make or modify to fit. Brake lines can
be bent by hand, but that one has a complicated shape and two tight bends
close to each other - you can get a cheap bending tool at most parts places.

Yes, the brakes need to be bled, but only that front caliper.
