Subject: [T2] 82 Westy

Hi all,

     I picked up my 82 westy tonight.  How cool!  It really drives well.  It
is now dark so it is kinda hard ot play with it.  I may play hookie
tomorrow.  The heater blower is not working at all.  I have not figured out
if it is a fuse or something worse.  The clock does work.  I will get some
pictures &amp; get them up on my web page.

     I was wondering if anyone has a extra 82 owners manual.  It did come
with the camper supplement.  Thanks.
