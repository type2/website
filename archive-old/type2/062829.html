Subject: VolksFest '96

Today's the day.  If you are in the Pacific Northwest then you really should
head on over to Yakima for the day/weekend.
Pre-Fest starts at 3pm at the Sears Roebuck parking lot in Union Gap with a
variety of activities including a Poker run with cash prizes and it is all
free and for the first time it's open to other types of cars too.  Tomorrow
at 8 am VolksFest '96 begins and will only be open to VW's.
Lots of VW's, fun &amp; games, swap-meet, the west coast get-together of Things,
sponsored by the Trim Shop out of Phoenix.
We'd like to see you all, there...
Jerry
