This message was sent to you by hatfieldd_at_hotmail_dot_com
to invite you to join a unique and philanthropic endeavor to save
precious rain forest land!!

Rain forests provide 25-40% of all pharmaceutical products. Two acres,
equivalent in size to two football fields, of rain forest are
destroyed every second. To help preserve the rain forest and make the
planet a healthier place for all of us, simply visit Care2_dot_com's Race
for the Rain Forest site and click on the &quot;Save the Rain Forest&quot;
button:

    http://rainforest_dot_care2_dot_com/front.html/66a19a9a2f0a7809

Each click generates a donation, paid by advertising sponsors, to The
Nature Conservancy's Adopt An Acre program.

Register online and you could win a trip for two to the rain forests of
Belize!  Each time you visit, your chances of winning increase.

Thank you for your support!


The Race for the Rain Forest is hosted by Care2_dot_com
(http://www_dot_care2_dot_com), homebase for people who care about the
environment.
