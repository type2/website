Subject: Assistance replacing the oil cooler in a 78 (Seattle area)

Hi...long time member, but mostly a lurker.

The oil cooler in my 78 is leaking badly and needs to be replaced.
Theory is that the oil pressure valve is stuck and needs to be replaced
as well.  I'd like to take this job on as my first DIY engine work.
I've read the bentley manual discussion on it, and it doesn't look like
too complicated a project, however I'm still somewhat intimidated by it.

Is there anyone in the Seattle area who would be willing to look over
the shoulder of a neophyte bus mechanic, and give some basic
assistance/handholding?

Thanks, all.

-mike
