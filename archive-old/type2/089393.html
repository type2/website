Subject: Scraping in turns

I've had a bit of a problem crop up recently with my '74 Sopru that has =
me a bit stumped at the moment.

When I do a left turn, I get a bit of scraping noise that sounds like =
the front disks, no noise when the wheel's turned right, but happens =
every time I turn to the left, unless I have to do a really sharp left =
turn it's just a very faint scraping, on a hard left it gets a bit =
rough/raucous.

I've also had a bit of squealing when I stopped recently.

I expected that it was an indication that the pads were gone, so they =
were flopping onto the disk in turns &amp; giving me the light metal on =
metal sound, but I've got under &amp; checked both callipers &amp; there appears =
to be plenty of pad left on both sides (the disks aren't significantly =
scored, either, BTW).

Does anyone have any ideas of what else to check before I bite the =
bullet &amp; go back into the VW specialist to get them to find what the =
problem is?

Thanking you in anticipation.
