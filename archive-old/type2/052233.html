Subject: [T2] Piston Ring Question
Content-Disposition: inline

List,
While installing new pistons and cylinders last night on my 2L Type IV, I accidentely broke one of the new rings while trying to install a piston into the cylinder.  My question is this:  Do I have to buy an entire set of rings now?  I have the rings from the old pistons which dont measure up exactly with the new ones but appear in decent shape.  Is is horrible to replace brand spankin new pistons and cylinders with a worn ring?  It sounds like that would be stupid to me.  Also, two of the cylinders and one of the heads are already installed.  If I have to buy a complete set of rings, should I replace the ones on the pistons already installed?  Im buying the rings from the same source so I would assume they would be the same or very close.  Advice on this seemingly simple matter would be helpful!  Consequences are also always nice to her too.  

Thanks again,
Chad
