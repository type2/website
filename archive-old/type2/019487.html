Hi Kevin,

Welding up cracks in an aluminum head is an exacting and time consumming job.  The ckacks have to machined down to where they end, the heads heated to approximately 400 F, and then welded with an aluminum rod closely matching the material in the head.  Then you have to machine the combustion chamber back to the original volume and tap the spark plug hole.  I recently purchased
two new bare dual port heads for $98.00 each, and two new complete single port heads for $129.00
each from Overland Parts at 1 (408) 848-4205 in the south San Francisco bay area.

My experience with rebuilt heads is they usually have a lot of questionable welding and repairs for a lot more money than you could find new heads.  Email me for other vendors I have found that have sale prices at various times.

Oh yeah, cracked heads are usually a sign of overheating.  Check for causes before you run your new heads.

Keep smiling,

Mike
