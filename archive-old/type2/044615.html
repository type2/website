Subject: RE: [T2] wood?

&gt;anyone got a lead on paneling that is if not pre cut, at least wide enough
&gt;to cover the ceilings?

Assuming your referring to the paneling over the front seats on campers.
There is a European size available which is 5'x5', but no one stocks it.
You have to special order it so $$$$. The other two options are to run the
grain sideways, which is the cheapest solution if you will be painting or
covering it somehow, or the way I did it, and have a seam down the center
on the 1/8&quot; Oak veneer plywood with clear finish. Speaking from experience,
the center seam doesn't work very well.
