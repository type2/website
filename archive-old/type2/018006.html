&gt; --&gt; I can understand this point of view.  Not everyone who carbs an FI
&gt; engine does it through lack of knowledge, though.  I thoroughly understood
&gt; the FI system on my van...after going through it multiple times from end
&gt; to end, it became obvious that it had multiple chronic problems, at least
&gt; one of them very expensive.  

David,
You do make a good point on the economic issue.  Certainly it's cheaper
to convert to a carb than to fix multiple expensive component FI
problems (like if you had a bad AFM and bad fuel pump all at once).

But for me I don't know if the savings would be worth it with regard to
the hassle involved.

To each his own I suppose.  But I won't be buying your van unless you
give me all the FI stuff ;-)
