The rear left indicator light of my 70 bus was not working. Two days later, 
the right side was gone too.The bulbs are OK (not blown).The front 
indicators are working well. I reckon this is a common problem just that I'm 
not good at electricals. Can anyone help me with this?

Cheers,
Mick of 70 Baja bus
