Subject: Travel Prep

Hello-
I am prepping our 78 Westy for our first big trip cross country (Philly 
to Spokane, WA- via Canada).
Any tips on tune-up prep prior to take-off, aside form the normal?

I have been working on gettin  the fridge operational, but to no avail. 
All of the wiring seems to trace out alright, but there is no action 
when I flip the switch. The unit has not been run in awhile (I don't 
think the previous owner used it in  the 3 0r 4 years he owned it). I am 
thinking I'll simply tear it out and replace with a new, 12V cooler, 
unless someone has some idea of  a trick I am missing.
Thanks,
cdavid
78 Westy
