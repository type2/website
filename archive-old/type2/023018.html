Subject: [ADMIN] Digest and AOL
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,

In the last week or two I've gotten several complaints that digests are 
only being received sporadically.  Everyone with this problem is from the 
aol_dot_com domain (hmmm...).  We are working on it so please bear with us.  In 
the meantime, if anyone that is *not* using AOL is not receiving all of the 
digests, please send e-mail to type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com and let us know.

Thanks,

-David
