	Subject: RE: [T2] One tough nut!

	I bent a 3/4 inch breaker bar!  I was persistent but came out on the
	losing side.  Any suggestions?

Are you sure you're standing on the correct side of the nut?  Every VW I've
worked on has reverse threads on one side.  Also, residual pieces of old
cotter pins can really gum up the works.  If you still can't get it off I
would suggest taking it down to a truck tire place where they have a big
monster air impact wrench.
