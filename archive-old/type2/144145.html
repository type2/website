&gt; &gt; A very interesting analysis, George. I had wondered about the
&gt; &gt; insulating properties myself.
&gt;
&gt; I think we're blessed to have some really good VW books that cover our
&gt; engines and vehicles but none of the authors are exempt from pushing some
&gt; bogus advice now and again.

True, but it's not really not malicious.  The writers tend to be
self-taught engineer types who are very knowledgeable, but whose knowledge
might be quite empirical.  Such folks may not be aware that there is a
difference between radiation and convection, and the fact that the
water-filled thing on the front of most cars is called a &quot;radiator&quot; when
it functions purely by convection doesn't help.

I'm a &quot;degreed&quot; engineer, which means that i've been forced to learn a
set curriculum which included such esoterica as thermodynamics and heat
transfer.  I therefore have a pretty good grasp of exactly how the VW
engine is intended to move its waste heat to the environment, and it
isn't by radiation!.

The problem with &quot;degreed&quot; engineers like me is that we can explain with
mathematical rigor exactly how your VW engine functions, but we sometimes
can't figure out which end of a screwdriver to hold.  :)
