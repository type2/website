&gt; &gt; Replace your flexible brake lines!!!!
SNIP
&gt; so I'm just replacing everything so I'll have a
&gt;reference point. In any event, the relatively few bucks you'll spend on
&gt;getting your braking system in top order is far cheaper than an emergency
&gt;room visit or a funeral.

This is a must do on every bus you buy. Its cheap and a life saver. At worst
you will end up with useful spares, but if not done at worst is V. bad
indeed.
	At the price its worth doing a replacement of all moving brake components
if your bus is a keeper. More spares.  Mine cost $200 Oz for the lot. (about
10 cents US at the moment, hahaha) and made a big difference to the bus AND
to how I feel in it.
