Subject: Re:DashPanelRemoval

&gt;The RB says
&gt;&quot;remove the pins&quot; and they just slide out. Well they don't tell you where
&gt;they are or how to get them out! Now I have found them, but can't get them
&gt;out with breaking them. Can any one help with this? Thanks.
&gt;
Just went thru the same thing with my instrument panel removal.  First I removed
the radio to give me access to the littl white plastic pins.  Then used a
7/32 socket to push on the pins so I could compress the 4 split pieces at
the same time and the pins would pop out far enought for me to pry them out
with a screwdriver.  The socket has to be large enough to compress the 4
split ends, and small enough to still push the pin out after it has
compressed the ends.  
Took about an hour of pushing, sweating, and saying nasty words, but I got them
out without breaking any of them.
