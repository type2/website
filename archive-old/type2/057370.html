Hi to all.  Far too much bandwidth is being spent to acknowledge the
sophomoric behavior of a few listee's.  We all know that Bob Hoover
contributes far more to this list than he receives.  We need to recognize
his value as a resource, thank him endlessly, and compensate him
accordingly.  I hope Bob can see his way to re-establishing a link with the
Type II list.  Then, just as he has done countless times in the past, he
could give us some advice on how best to fix this mess.
