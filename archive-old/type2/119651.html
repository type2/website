Subject: Van will start...20 seconds later it dies by itself?????

I had the identical symptom with my '79 2.0 FI bus when I tried to
start it the first time after buying it. The problem turned out to be a
defective air flow meter, which is a component of the fuel injection
system. If you have access to another air flow meter, you might try
swapping it with yours just to see whether that is the problem. Good 
luck.
