Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon hubcap wanted

Christopher,

Good luck.  There are at least two of us with partial sets
that desperately want some replacements.  They are apparently
very difficult to find.

ONe guy has 2 and needs two, I have 3 and would be happy with one more
to go with my freshly painted 78 champagne edition that is coming home 
next weekend.

If you find anyone with more than 1 to sell, please let me know!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for just one of those vanagon hubcaps with the wolfsburg castle 
&gt; in the center. I have 4, painted white, and looking for a 5th to put on the 
&gt; nose mounted spare.
&gt; 
&gt; This one doesn't have to be white, I can paint it myself if needed.
&gt; 
&gt; p-mail me if you have one available, but be sure to leave the [t2] in the 
&gt; subject line, or my mail filter will block it out.
