Subject: Re: [T2] Buying a bus for the first time...

where are you located and what mechanical shape do you need? does it have
to be running or are you willing to work on that if you get a bus in good
physical shape? there is one here in tulsa, ok (not running but the body
looks great so far, $595) and i have a friend who finds VWs all the time.
let us know where you are and how far you are willing to go to find a
bus...

The bus in particular I'm looking at is a

&gt; a 1600cc engine.  Thanks in advance!
