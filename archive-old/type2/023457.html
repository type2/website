I was under the impression that that collar was meant to be loose (?), that 
in fact a loose grub screw was what usually made the system slip. I have the 
same problem from time to time as the end of the screw in mine doesn't fit 
the indentation in the hockey stick shaft well and wears down rapidly with 
use, and so I fix it by tightening the screw every so often. I'm thinking of 
drilling right through the linkage and hockey stick shaft and putting in a 
tractor-style push pin for a permanent fix. Anyone ever done this?
