&gt;     Hello listers.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like you to tell me, if possible, what is a solenoid and what does a
&gt; relay do and what`s their functions.

the solenoid is a part of your starter.  It acts like a high-current
relay.  When you turn the key, you send a small current through a coil
that creates a magnetic field that moves a metal rod that forces together
a pair of high-current contacts that connect the battery to the starter
motor
