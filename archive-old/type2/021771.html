Subject: Engine reinstallation-tips when alone-

Tips for working ALONE:
1. Make sure you know the balance point on the engine front to back. Tip
it back, slide a 2x4 under it side to side, balance engine.  Note where
this is by marking the heater box side. This is the real key! Also good
lighting is needed, shining it down through engine access hatch.
2. I jack up the rear wheels to stand on at least 3 nailed together 2x8
boards, to allow clearance for lying under there and for sliding in the
engine (minus jack).  To make it easy to get the engine shaft parallel
to the trans, I jack up the front equally, leaving it on jack stands.
3. Get a long digging bar or piece of 2x4 and a fulcrum (concrete cap
block) to get under the heater box on each side and lift the engine,
sliding in increasingly higher stacks of boards under the heater boxes
until you can get the jack under. If your lever is long enough, you can
place a concrete block on the end to hold it while sliding in boards.
3. Use a board  of 3/4&quot; plywood wide enough to span under each heater
box and about a foot deep- spreads the stress- I have placed a circle of
nails in the center to match the size of jack top.
4. Once you have the engine rising (and balanced), use a sledge to make
side to side adjustments by tapping the jack bottom.  The clearance is
tight because of the trans shaft, which must be lined up to center in
the pressure plate.  The oil filler pipe can be removed, or &quot;tweaked&quot; by
sticking a 3 foot pipe into it and bending it forward a bit.
5.  Make sure the sides of the engine mount are in alignment with the
frame they slide over (did you grease the rail a bit?): I leave one side
real loose to ease this.
6. I have a stool in the back to stand on and look down the access hatch
to check that wires aren't being pinched, and the acc. cable is inserted
and to eyeball the trans shaft centering.
7.  Lying underneath, you can check the alignment of getting the lower
mount studs in line to the trans. Tap with sledge!  I have this
brainstorm of attaching a handwinch to the jack and ratching it tighter
while watching underneath!
8. Push engine from rear also, doing some rocking and if needed, use a
wrench on the alternator nut to ease alignment of the transhaft with the
disk splines.  You should be able to turn it easily. When you can get a
grip with a nut on the lower studs, start tightening it up; then do the
upper studs.
9.  Having a &quot;drift&quot; handy is useful for aligning the engine carrier
holes with the body rails.  A really loong punch is good.
