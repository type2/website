Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Testing a Fuel Injection harness??

Hey Tom - Try looking at Chapter 10, Fuel Injection,
Wiring diagram on page 5. It is the harness for FI and
only the FI harness. Might help the confusion - either
more or less! -BaH

&gt; How odd.  I do have the 68-79 Bentley, and all the
&gt; wiring diagrams are 
&gt; listed in the electrical section's index.  But all
&gt; wiring diagrams except 
&gt; the &quot;Supplement to Wiring Diagram A&quot; (first item
&gt; listed) and &quot;Fresh Air 
&gt; Circuit and Rear Window Defogger Circuit&quot; (last item
&gt; listed) aren't there, 
&gt; and clearly were *never* there.  It's not that these
&gt; diagrams have been 
&gt; removed, they were just never bound in my volume.
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley Publishing has obviously played an
&gt; elaborate, multi-decade long hoax 
&gt; in order to frustrate my ambitions to understand my
&gt; wiring harness!
