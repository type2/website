Hey Shelby,
   In an earlier post today you said  &quot;i dont know if its because of all the 
weirdos in society.....&quot;.
   Well I think that most of society thinks of us as the weirdos.  Last 
sunday, while driving our 71 westy, my wife and I stopped to help a young 
woman with a flat tire.  She was sitting on the curb and refused our help, 
saying that AAA was already on the way.  I suggested we could save her time 
and $$ by changing the tire for her, but she adamantly refused to let us 
help.  As I walked back to our bus I heard her say something like &quot;Why would 
you want to help a stranger anyway?&quot;.  I felt like giving her the long 
version of why I would help a stranger, but didn't, as 5 of us were anxious 
to go hiking.
