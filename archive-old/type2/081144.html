Subject: Re: [T2] Yokohama 356 185r 75 14 &quot;D&quot; 1800 capacity

I did not see any other replies to this question.
WRONG size!!!
The correct bus tire does NOT have 75 in the middle. 
It is 185R14.  NO ASPECT RATIO!



&gt; Hey Ya'll,
&gt; I have been my due diligence on research, am ready to order.  Is there any
&gt; reason I should not order this tire???
&gt; Oh yeah, $71 per installed from Discount tire.
