&gt;If you talk to the &quot;battery experts&quot; they will tell you it's not a good idea
&gt;to charge your camping battery with the engine.  The reason being after a
&gt;night of camping, your battery will be pretty well drained and the voltage
&gt;regulator will kick the alternator into high gear giving the battery a high
&gt;charge which can boil the battery pretty quick.

With all due respect, this isn't really an issue.  The alternator will always attempt to bring your &quot;system&quot; up to ~14V and it may take some current initially to do this, but if you have a dual battery system joined with an isolator, the moment the batteries are connected the dead one will draw a large amount of current from the full one whether the alternator is working or not.  Additionally, the alternator is only capable of putting out about 30 amps into the drained aux battery, and that will only happen for a minute or two, after which time the charging current will stabilize somewhere between 5-15 amps depending on the capacity of the aux battery.  I have experimented with this stuff for over 25 years and I have never damaged a battery this way.  The only time you can boil a battery is when it is fully charged and you continue to force-feed it by allowing the regulated voltage to go above 15V.

&gt;The best way in my opinion would be to use a large solar panel on the roof
&gt;and charge on the go or while camping, I have seen this setup on a couple
&gt;westies and it works great.

If the solar panel is properly regulated and can keep up with the electrical demands on the battery, yes.  But if you run a fridge or other high-drain devices, solar panels will not be enough.
