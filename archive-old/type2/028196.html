hello list!

well,i finaly got a wiring diagram for type 2 '72(1973-1975 models).  i 
think i got it from type2's library (i'm not sure, sorry). I have spent a 
couple of days staring at it, but nothing has come up yet. my e- background 
sucks, and my bus (montaña) is a spaghetti western indeed.  does anyone have 
any pointers on how to read (understand) this?        i would like to 
straighten the mess.

thank you,,,,,,
cmontaña
