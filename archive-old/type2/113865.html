Subject: Re: [T2] clutch cable again II

&gt;Old cable came out and was totally broken (all strands) right where it would exit the bowden tube.

&gt;There were NO adjusting washers on my bowden tube at all. I assume this lack of tension is my problem with cables as I'm always adjusting down to the end of the threaded rod and sawing cables in two.

My cables run near the end of the threaded rod also.  My bus did not have any Bowden tube spacers when I got it, but I tried some a few years ago.  They resulted in increased pedal effort and a larger angle of deflection in the Bowden tube, so I removed most of them (all but one?) recently.
