Subject: Oh Holly Exhaust

Hello All,
   Its about time that i do something about my leaky exhaust. Its a 79 system, and the only piece that i need to fix is the long pipe that goes across the back. I have looked to replace this, and have found that it is over the amount that i would like to spend right now. 
  The holes (yes, plural) aren't that big, but are getting bigger than the pinholes that they were when I should have decided to do this. Does anybody have any product suggestions that can help me? I got a thing of &quot;Muffler Mend&quot;, but it flaked off after I ran it. The box suggests using a fiberglass cloth between layers for large holes. I can tell that the areas have rust, and figured that i would take a wire wheel to it, but am concerned that i will hit weak spots and ruin the whole pipe. 
  Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated. Oh, should minor irregularities hinder performance as far as the exhaust goes?
  
Matt O.
