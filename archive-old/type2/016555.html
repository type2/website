Subject: Engine swap

I have a 1973 bus im putting a new engine into.  I want to use the
upright 1776cc DP.  Is this a bad choice??  I have been told id be
better off with a 2.0 with FI.  I prefer carburetion, and since i've
worked on 1600cc bug motors before, i wanted to stick with an upright,
not a flat?  Any advice would be appreciated.  

Thanks alot!
