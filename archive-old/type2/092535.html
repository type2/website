Subject: Fixin' my '72

So I'm getting my T-II configured for vacation. I removed the Z-bed and the 
linoleum and plywood from the floor. Wire brushed all the rust and pits 
yesterday. Scrubbed and washed is all down. Today I will apply rust 
conversion chemical, seal all the holes from the screws holding the wood 
and Z-bed, and paint with spray enamel.

One thing I noted was the rear heater vents. The flange that bolts to the 
floor was not sealed very well at all. I resealed them and blocked off the 
tubes and expect much better heat delivery up front.

I will be installing a plywood riser extending the rear deck all the way 
forward to the back of the front seats with hatches to access storage on 
the floor.

If anyone wants the Z-bed let me know. It comes with good black upholstery, 
no holes or tears whatsoever, and the same matching pad for the rear deck. 
I don't want to even think about how to package the thing for shipment. If 
you come pick it up (San Juan Island), price is $50. I will be travelling 
down I-5 in a coupla weeks from Mt. Vernon south to Centralia, WA, so if 
anyone in that vicinity wants it, let me know and delivered price will be $75.

Put on a new steering stabilizer, and along with the new spec tires, very 
nice handling and control. No more wobble when hitting pot holes.

Regards,
