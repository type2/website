Subject: Re: [T2] some questions from a beginner

well all i can say is that daily driver will run you about anywhere 
from 1-6 k maybe....
also you will learn all you need to know if you want to ....by owning 
one
you have asked alot of questions though i feel that can only be 
answered from ownership of a bus./......
sounds like to me though you are looking for a newer vanagon though but 
i could be wrong... just my thoughts as a i read about 70 mph speeds 
and ac and heat and all those luxuries.,,,,,,,, i dont go over 50 mph at 
all in my bus and if  i go faster than that down hil i hit the 
brakes.... these buses bays and splitties alike werent made for those 
speeds.....
they were made to enjoy the ride....
sure they can go those speeds but i dont reccomend it for any of my vw 
friends and family ....
hope this helps even though i didnt answer all your answers....
peace
Chris

also fun. i think a bus fits well with what i am looking for. i am making a 
few basic assumptions about buses from what little knowledge i have. maybe 
you all could correct me if i am mistaken? i understand it is fairly easy 
to remove the engine and that aircooled engines from volkswagen are fairly 
simple to fix/wrench on/maintain. i also understand that it recieves fairly 
good gas mileage and if cared for is very dependable. please tell me if i 
am wrong!!!. i am looking into buying a project bus not for complete 
restoration but for making a daily driver with road-trip capabilities. so 
what am i looking at mpg wise on the average type 2? what should i be 
looking to pay? i have made a list of what i want in this bus and i 
understand that some of it will have to aftermarket labor and parts. here 
is my list. if you could direct me as to what parts/kits i might need, 
books to read, classes to take etc, i would greatly appreciate it.

-i need a dependable daily driver capable of sustained 70mph speeds - i 
understand there are dual carb options and special transmisions...where, 
how, what?

-i need heat and possibly a/c. - are there kits for this?

-i understand that sway bars are a good idea - anything particular i am 
looking for in a good sway bar?

-if the mpg is less than 25mpg what can i do to improve this?

-about how much time a month am i looking at to keep it in daily driver and 
highway speed shape?
will i need any specialized tools?

-how safe is a bus in accident situation? rollover?

-relatively how expensive is it to purchase parts for a bus '68 or up? 
thanks for your help!!!
