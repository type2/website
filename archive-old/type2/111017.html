Subject: Re: [T2] EGR....optional??

&gt; I talked to a guy who has worked on bugs and
&gt; transporters for a while and he 
&gt; told me i could disconnect the whole Exhaust Gas
&gt; Recirculation system, 
&gt; starting at the throttle without any negative
&gt; consequences...he said it doesn't work 
&gt; that well anyway.  Has anyone ever done this, or am
&gt; I the only knucklehead to 
&gt; do it?  What could the possible repurcussions be?

My EGR system has been removed for several years, and
I see no difference in performance. Theoretically
there would be a slight difference in gas mileage, as
the unused gas gets recirculated. I doubt it is much
though. 

Also, I have passed two different emissions checks
since. Don't have to worry about it anymore though,
the bus is 25 years old now, and doesn't require it!!
;)

I hear that some states are more thorough than others,
and do a visual inspection for egr, and if it is
missing, well.....
