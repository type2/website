Subject: Re: [T2] 72 bus and 412 motor 

&gt;   30 years later, VW still finds it difficult to go upmarket
&gt;   while their current efforts (Passat W12, Touareg, Phaeton)
&gt;   will hold their own to any BMW or Mercedes, even today the
&gt;   Bimmer/Mercedes crowd still don't much covet a VW emblem on
&gt;   their car.

This is probably a rat-hole, but I'd guess that
car maker most in trouble these days is Mercedes
in that why would you buy one with Lexus on the
market? [1]

[1] I own a '92 Saab 900, a '78 Type 2, and nothing
else, so I'm talking about marketing not what I'd
myself want.
