Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler retainer

 When I took off the retaining ring I noticed that the 6 month old
reproduction fuel filler neck (211 201 119) is already torn and split where
the screw holes go.

Richard, I just bought one of these today, and my husband and I were just
now looking at it and talking about it. My husband had some very interesting
observations about it.
My '78 is a California one, with the catalytic converter. The fuel filler
neck for that is a little different, because instead of one large,
unobstructed passage, there is a sort of membrane going across the opening
(about an inch below the top), with two smaller holes! This is really wierd!
The number is 211 201 119A, and it is no longer available (NLA). I kinda
freaked when no one had it, but then I was able to go and look at one of the
regular ones, and realized that it would work just as well. They &quot;A&quot; version
are no longer necessary.
So, my husband and I are looking at these two, and wondering why they are so
different. Well, hubby has worked in petroleum for years and years, and then
he says, &quot;Oh!... This was in the early years when you could still buy leaded
fuels.&quot; He pointed out that leaded fuels would ruin a catalytic converter,
and the petroleum companies made the nozzles with different diameters so
that consumers wouldn't be able to put leaded fuel (larger nozzle) into an
unleaded-only vehicle (smaller nozzle). Accordingly, the auto manufacturers
were supposed to make an input fueling port for catalytic converter vehicles
that was too small to accept a larger leaded fuel nozzle. The nozzles were
also designed to have a sort of overfill shutoff system, and would shut off
if there was any backpressure. This they did frequently, and people would
keep reinserting and restarting the nozzle while muttering curses. LOL.
But the nozzle and fill tube were supposed to be a close fit. Most of the
American auto manufacturers used an all-metal fill tube fueling port that
was fairly indestructable. But catalytic converters were still fairly new
back then, and VW only made one model with catalytic converter for the
California market, the only state where it was required. When they made the
fill tube elbow (fueling port) for this model, it was apparently almost as
an afterthought, and they just made it all out of rubber...and the rubber is
NOT very durable! The result in mine was that it was torn all to heck where
someone kept trying to jam these nozzles in the fill tube! They also made a
tear in the fill tube elbow where it goes onto the metal tube to the tank.
That's probably where I was getting some of my vapors in the cab.
In looking at this fill tube elbow, it wasn't very well designed. It is very
shallow, goes in at a 90* angle, and the rubber is fairly thin. I don't
think that it is either a specialized rubber that is designed to withstand
the stresses of gasoline additives today.
I also noticed that the rubber seems a bit thinner than the original at the
edge where it attaches under the metal retaining ring, but it has the VW
logo on it, and the part number. I think that it is a VW original.
I was just so thankful that I was able to get all of the tubes, still!
Actually, I could not get the tube-to-tank hose, about a 5&quot; long piece of
braided rubber hose. I was told that it might be available by two sources,
and I was given a two dealer prices of $75 and $90!!!! I went over to a NAPA
store and bought a piece of Gates brand fuel rated, reinforced hose for
about $12 a foot (I had to buy a whole foot). It fit PERFECTLY, snug but not
tight.. definitely will use hose clamps. Do NOT try to use radiator hose for
this. It won't last.
