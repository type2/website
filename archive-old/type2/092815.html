Subject: RE: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)


&gt;If your rear floor vent was open at the time, you would have watercooled
&gt;exhaust for a little while, and probably get a nice steam bath through
&gt;the vents. Sauna on wheels anyone?

On a summer vacation to Venice we were driving my '72 Super on the 
autostrada as fast as the little 40 HP would carry us. We drove into a 
HEAVY downpour that had flooded the road with about 4&quot; of water. 
Immediately my heaters, which leaked a bit of hot air, began filling the 
car with steam. In no time we could not see the road ahead so I slowed to 
25 mph and drove with the window open while my sister searched furiously 
for a rag to wipe the windows clean on the inside.

No accidents but things were tense.


Ciao!
