Subject: Miniature Woodstove

I know that this is going to sound a bit insane, but a few decades ago I saw
a rather novel miniature woodstove installed in a van.  It was mounted via
it's chimney, and it couldn't have been larger around than maybe a 2-lb
coffee can, though it might have been a few inches longer in length.

With all of the propane heaters out there, a wood-fired heater sounds a bit
superfluous (and dangerous), but the idea is still intriguing.

I searched the archives and could only come up with a reference to a fellow
with a rather unique bus with a pull-start engine and lawnchair seats (!).
The link provided went to the DBG website, but their links are down.

Does anyone from my generation (or beyond) remember anything about the
miniature heater that I mentioned above?  I seem to remember seeing it in a
magazine article, but for all I remember from back then, I may have seen it
in person during a van show.
