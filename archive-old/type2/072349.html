Subject: Finally a defroster

I have been chasing down the heat, or rather lack of it, in my '76 Westy.

Disclaimer: While I live in San Diego CA with it's mild climate we 
still get frosts in the winter. Furthermore, I often drive the van to 
our local mountains where I can encounter snow. I need a clear 
windshield so winter heat in a vehicle is quite important even in a 
Mediterranean climate.

Anyway the cable to the right side flapper valve was broke and I 
ordered a replacement from the Bus Depot, but until it comes in I 
have the valve wired open. This helps quite a bit.

I still did not have air to the defroster vents and found that the 
control cable to that flapper valve was also broken. So I wired that 
valve in the open position as well until I get a replacement part. 
Now I am getting some effective defrosting.

However, the biggest problem was that the heater systems' squirrel 
cage blower above the engine would not come on when I lowered the 
heat lever. Without the blower I got more than enough air flow from 
the ram effect at highway speeds to bring heat forward, but not while 
driving slow. I traced the blower problem to a bad relay, but a 
replacement is not available and the good folks at Bus Depot do not 
know of an alternate part.

The blower itself worked fine when it could get power. So to get 
around the relay problem I ran a pair of wires from the blower to the 
dashborad and installed a toggle switch so I can turn it on and off 
as needed. This works great, I can use the blower when I first start 
up in the morning and am driving at low speeds through the 
neighborhood and turn it off when I get on the highway.

To help things even more I insulated the heater ducting underneath 
the van. I used closed cell foam salvaged from a sleeping pad, the 
kind used by backpackers.

I want to thank the whoever put the Heat, Rust, &amp; Noise in VW's web 
site together, I looked for a name on the site to mention them 
personally, but could not find one. If you have not yet done so I 
highly recommend you check out that site at 
http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/ The site helped me quite a bit getting 
heat back in my van.

Wether you are in a warm or cold winter climate, I wish you a happy 
holiday season and a great new year.
