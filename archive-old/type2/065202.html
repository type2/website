The honing marks can still be evident after 200+K KM or more than 100K Miles.
It's not really a good reference for determining how old the rebuild is.

As for the filter set up, keep it, it's bit a bit messy maybe, but it
reduces wear by
astronomical amounts, the Ford test data (50s) is often referred to to
illustrate this,
i don't have books here in my office, but they discovered that it reduced
- -among other things- wrist-pin wear by 66% (!) and -i'm not sure on this one-
they found that it reduced cylinder wear by 52%

Most upright VWs came from the factory without a drain plug if you ask me,
(i'm in Europe) that's why i call the no-plug plate a drain plate, to drain
the oil simply
loosen the nuts little by little untill the oil begins to seep through, let
it drain, drink
some coffee or change the plugs in the mean while, remove the plate together
with the oilscreen, let it drip some more, clean things, and up reinstall
using a new
oilscreen and gaskets.

In a stock VW without full flow filter set up i prefer to have the no-plug
plate,
simply because you then *have* to remove the plate and replace the screen,
you -or nobody else for that matter- can't do a quicky, skipping the oilscreen
replacement (yes, you can clean it as well, but you have to be really carefull
when you pull it from the engine, a new one will seal better) and you'll have
one tread less to strip and leak.

However, if you're using a full flow filter, as per Gene Berg's
reccommendations,
don't use the oilscreen. The obective is to reduce inlet restriction of the
oil pump,
Berg suggested to use a magnet near the oil pick up to trap metal particles
before they enter the pump (when not using a screen).

So for the no-screen set up i prefer the drain plug type to reduce wear on
the little
M6 studs and nuts, and, you can use a magnetic drain plug, get good quality,
there's enough junk out there. Now you only have to use one gasket, and,
together
with some RTV sealant, this will help keeping your motor dry.

Yet another thing, i often replace the six little studs with bolts, i use black 
8.8 grade M6 bolts, maybe 20 or 25 mm long, i don't recall exactly.
You have to do this when the case is apart flatten the little ribs around
the thread
holes a little with sand paper. you can use the copper rings from a gasket set,
i use Loctite pipe sealant on threads, but i guess 3H will do fine as well.
If you're figuring out how the bolts need to be bear in mind that the one that's
going to hold the pick up tube in place, that one will need to be a little
longer,
or, leave the copper ring off here to even the lenghts out, the ring won't seal
here anyway as the pich up tube flange that goes under the bolt has a cut out
to one side, leaving a gap under the copper ring.

With the above done you wont strip threads as easy as with studs only, since
the bolt head takes some of the strain off the treads in the case, the
treads are
better sealed, and if the tread *does* get damaged you still can fiddle a nut on
the bolt and tighten things up. Most important is that you use strong, high
quality
bolts, if you manage to strip the threads of them you'll be lokking at
splitting the
case.
