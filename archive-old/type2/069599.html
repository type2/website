Subject: Fuel pumps, '75 busses

Well now, that tears it.  I hooked up the pump from 
the Goose (fuel injection pump) on the Swan (Weber 
carb converted). OOPS.  Guess the pressure was too 
high.  I had asked the &quot;nice young man&quot; at the 
specialty VW shop (will remain nameless), who had 
said that it would not matter, that a fuel pump was 
a fuel pump, and that he didn't have time to 
discuss it.  Should have listened to the voice in 
the back of my head.  GAS CAME OUT OF THE AIR 
CLEANER.  I hope it came through relief valves, not 
rupture disks, cracks or in other unpleasant ways.

I bet someone out there knows just the type of 
electric fuel pump is required for a carbureted '75 
bus engine.  (If the parts store guys respond, I 
think I'll wait for corroborating testimony.)
