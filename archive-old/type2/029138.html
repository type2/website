Hi!  I just did this in July.  My passenger side tray was g o n e!  I got
the longest battery cable i could (+) it was about 3 feet I think from a
S*ucks Autoparts and a foot and a half long ground strap.  Make sure the
terminal heads are the same size as your battery terminals!

The process is pretty simple, the (+) runs to the starter through a
grommeted hole in the front of the engine on the passenger side.  It took a
bit of fanagleing to get the grommet on the new cable to reseal into the
hole.  Make sure the length of cable to the starter after the grommet is
long enough because tugging on it  to make it fit will allow you the joy of
getting the grommet back into the hole again.

When connecting the cable to the starter, make sure that the cable doesn't
interfere with the action of the heater box control arm.  The arm needs to
be able to move freely as does the heater cable connecting to it.

Lastly, I drilled a new hole for the ground connection to the frame.  I used
a wirebrush wheel on a drill to make the area around the hole shiny and a
good connection.  New through bolt and washer for the strap to the frame and
Voila!

Hope this helps and good luck!

Subject: [T2] relocating battery in 72 bus


&gt; After many years of fine service, the battery in the 1972 bus is giving up
&gt; the ghost. It is really time to relocate it to the left side of the engine
&gt; room becuase there isn't really any battery tray left. Has anyone done
this?
&gt; Any suggestions for running the hot and ground strap?
