you can buy a brand new 1600 VW engine for a little over $1000 and get
fuel injection and hydraulic valves,  that would be my first choice 

&gt; The firs thing I want to choice is the crankshaft.  Is a new counterweighted
&gt; cast crank better than a used stock VW crank?  Remember, I want a long
&gt; lasting stock engine.  so the counterweighted crank sounds better to lower
&gt; internal vibration once everyting well balanced.

at normal driving speeds a counterweighted crank really does not help that
much, spend the same money on balancing the stock crank and you will have
very smooth engine.

counterweighted crank is usefull at 8000rpm
