Subject: Re: [T2] what is this device


Sounds like the voltage regulator for your altenator. I don't think it
should be hot, maybe a little warm but not hot. Check all alternator
connections and make sure you don't have any shorts. What I do is turn
everything off, then remove the positive battery cable from the battery.
Next take either a test light or a volt meter and connect one end to the
positive cable and the other end to the positive terminal on the battery.
With everything off you should have zero volts or no light from your test
lamp. If the test light glows or you have voltage here you have a short.
Start pulling fuses one by one to isolate the short. When the light goes
out you have found the circuit that has the short. I found when rebuilding
my engine that the small ground wire coming from the alternator to the
regulator was all melted, this could be your problem. I'm no electrical
engineer so you  will probably get better advice from the engineers on this
list.

Bus-Boys_dot_com (NOTICE THE DASH :-)sells a new wiring harness for your
alternator.

I have a 74 bus.
In the engine cmprtment on the right side
mounted on the &quot;back wall&quot; is a elect, device.
It is white plastic and housed in a metal can
which is attached to the firewall. It has 4-5 wires
going to it. I is very hot to the touch.
What is it and should it be this hot?
Cant find it in the manual.

TIA
