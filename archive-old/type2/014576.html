Subject: 30/31 AND..............

Hello to The List,

Just installed a 30/31 on my 70 1600 single port.  And I realize that I have 
(maybe) a small problem.  I consulted my Bentley about adjusting idle, etc.  
There were no references to the 30/31.  In fact I can find no references to 
the 30/31 anywhere.  My assumption is that these carbs are treated like the 
30PICT family?  Is that correct?  If not, could you point me toward a good 
reference for this little beast?

AND..........I just finished converting my taillights from USA stock 70 to 
European stock 70.  They are much brighter and the addition of another bulb 
results in the entire oval area of the lens being used for light as well as 
the amber turn signals.  Way easier to see at night!
