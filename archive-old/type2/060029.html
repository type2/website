Subject: Brunhilda's electrical problem...

Thanks to all of you who responded with advice on the sudden &quot;no start&quot; problem.  I really
am on top of this stuff, Guys.  'Hildy is my fourth Bus, and between my wife and I , we
have owned 12 VWs.  I rewired my '67 to 12 volt, and drove crosscountry coast to coast
prior to the new 12 volt system, crawling under the right side with my trusty screwdriver
to short across the connections on the solenoid every time I stopped, so I grok the
resistance/heat/switch  schmear as a gestalt.

I have lived here in northern Idaho, in the same little town, for 12 years.  For all of
those years, my mechanic has been the same guy.  He was school-trained by VW, and worked
for the local dealership until it went under, and then opened his own shop.  He is a
personal friend, and I have had his kids in junior high school.  He has done lots of work
on my various Busses over the years, and dispensed good, free, advice on many occasions.
I trust the guy.  I think that Uffe was right when he described the manner in which a
battery can short internally and be unable to turn the starter, while still having the
juice to run the dash lights and the radio.
