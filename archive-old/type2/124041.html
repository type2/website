Subject: Brake Job 71

Ok those who know more than me, I am attempting to replace the rear wheel
cylinder on a 71.  All brake related hardware is off.
There is a 13mm bolt securing the cylinder to the backing plate.
Bentley says work from behind the plate, there is no bolt behind.
My buddy decided to remove the 46mm nut and remove the hub to do his job.
I am afraid to do so.
How do I get a wrench or socket on this rascal to replace the wheel
cylinder?

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
