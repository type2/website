Subject: [T2] to repair original upholstry seams?

It is time to put the seats back in the '67. The upper part of the rearmost
seat has split at the seam between the  the front where your back rests and
the top (sides). A better way to explain this might be that the mesh part
has seperated from the solid colored part at the piping.. Upon examing this
it appears that the thread has simply crumbled into oblivian. The seat
material is not in the greatest of condition but is usuable.

We have a Bernina sewing machine at the house. I am not much of a seamster
but thought I would have a go at trying to fix the seam. Any thoughts on
what kinda needle or thread I should use? I have also considered doing it by
hand with sailmakers thread and needle.

The padding seems to be in good order. Will the horse hair pads survive the
removal of the seat covers?

BTW, Ronnie ( www.type2parts_dot_com )  sent me a sample or the TMI Mesh
Platinum repop material and it looks nice. The mesh part seem right on. The
solid seems a bit more bronzish than the unUVed sections that I have but
still will look nice. Once I finish  throwing  money at a bunch of other
problems I am going to get a set of front seat covers from Ronnie and start
the process one section of seats at a time.

Thanks
