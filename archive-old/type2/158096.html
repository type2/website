Subject: RE: [T2] HOSED by a transport company!

&gt;I've gotta say that's a big leap of faith...

I agree, but I thought I was getting what I wanted and it turned out to be
great!! I had about 40 pictures of the bus and emailed the seller about it a
lot. I never actual talked to the guy in person, I think he was selling it for
someone else. I even got a book from the previous owner that showed every fuel
fill up, oil change, spark plug change, etc done to the bus since the early
80's. It showed several trips across the US, etc. I actually sat down and read
it all once.....

I was a leap of faith, but I felt good about it. Sometimes you just have to go
with your gut and very few times has it let me down... I think talking to
someone that is not actually the owner was also good. I also requested that a
local VW shop inspect it before I bought it and he agreed to take it there. I
never got it checked out, but he was willing to take it there.
