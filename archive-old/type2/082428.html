&gt; Thias is why WD-40 is an excellent fuel for potato=20
&gt; cannon's--the propane
&gt; makes them spud's really fly----=20

Hmm, I'll have to try that, I usually use hair spray.  A couple of years
ago, my brother and I were firing the canon and he decided to try
starting fluid.  After loading up the canon, it apparently didn't
want to fire, I figured he wet the ignitor or something, I looked over
as he was giving it one last try, and the thing ignited, and the canon
lit up the night with a bright orange glow, almost looked like a =
lightbulb.
I think were lucky the thing didn't explode. We decided to stick to hair =
spray.=20
