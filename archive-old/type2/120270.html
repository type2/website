Subject: Tell me what you think of this bus....

Hey, I'm thinking of buying this bus on ebay.  It
looks kind of shady though.  I was wondering if anyone
with knowledge of buses could take a look at it and
let me know what they think:

Thanks!!!


-Rob


P.S. Please don't buy it.  That would be mucho messed up.
