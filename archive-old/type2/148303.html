Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

Hi Greg,

Well, more precisely the scenario is 74 bus with no engine tranny. Got
a 3 rib tranny for it and a 79 motor. I expected 74 to be setup for a
newer tranny than the 3 rib, but I really don't know what years went
with which tranny. I just know I had no trouble with the shifter in
this setup. Same problem as my 72 though in needing the bell housing
clearanced for the bigger flywheel.

 Putting the 2.0L engine  on a 3-rib is no problem as long as you swap
 the 210/215 flywheel over to the new engine.

 It's when you swap the tranny (6 rib swapped for 3/5) that the
 shifter length issues come up.
