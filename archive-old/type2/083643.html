Subject: hardest drives

&gt; That one was impressive enough that I have a picture
of the bus with the
&gt; sign at the top.  11012 feet, IIRC

&gt;&gt;got the same photo. but had to use a flash as it was
&gt;&gt;somewhere about
&gt;&gt;midnight by the time I got there

I have the same photo (top of the pass above Ouray
CO)but with six inches of fresh snow on the ground.
Now that was a scary drive...
Old Priest grade is still the hardest drive either up
or down.
