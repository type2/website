Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon fresh air flaps

&gt;I'm noticing the fresh air from the nose intake more than I
&gt;would like.  Is it supposed to be possible to shut off this flow with the
&gt;factory controls, or is the standard option to tape over the opening/use a
&gt;bra?  Even with all my controls closed/full hot I get cold air either from
&gt;the screen vents or, if the top lever is all the way right, from the foot
&gt;vents.  I consulted the Bentley and the flaps that close off this vent
&gt;appear to be free swinging and not connected to any of the cables.  How
&gt;are they intended to operate?  thanks. jon

Lever connects to an adjustable control rod (should be about horizontal to 
help you find it) and it may need a tweak to make it shorter.

More likely is the idea that the foam on the inside of the flaps has gone 
to pieces.

Remove the cowl vent out front, remove the flappers, and remove old foam. 
Replace with new foam. I use 1/8&quot; thick self adhesive foam used for 
wrapping pipes from Lowe's. There may be a better solution.

I also like the piece of  magnetic material sourced from a sign shop to 
cover the cowl vent outside.
