&gt; But! this is the part that always gets me about &quot;our&quot; replies

&gt; incorrectly.
&gt;
&gt; So, what is the correct &quot;factory&quot; procedure for putting the steering wheel
&gt; on correctly?

The important part of steering wheel adjustment is that the steering box
be centered.  If you turn the steering wheel through exacly half of its
rotation then the spokes on the steering wheel ought to be level. If they
are not then someone has misadjusted the front end at some point.

Volkswagen buses originally had one fixed and one adjustable tie rod.
The correct procedure for aligning a bus front end calls for setting half
the toe on the wheel with the fixed tie rod by hand then setting the other
half of the toe on the other wheel by adjusting the length of the other
tie rod.  With the toe correctly set the drag link is then removed from
the pitman arm and the steering box is centered.  The drag link is
adjusted to the length needed and reattached to the pitman arm.

To find a bus that has had proper front end maintainance over the decades
is truly rare.  Many buses these days have two adjustable tie rods and on
those that don't the steering wheel has been removed and reinstalled to
to level it. The first procedure is acceptable but the second leaves the
steering box off-center and causes excessive wear on the box.

Please note that on 1975-1979 buses the steering wheel will lift off once
the nut is removed but that earlier buses will require a puller to remove
the wheel from the tapered splines on the steering shaft.

                             OOK!
