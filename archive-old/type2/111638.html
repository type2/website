Subject: Westfalia Parts

Hey guys, how easy to come by are the Westfalia parts? I'm really
interested in possibly getting the Z-bed, and the cabinetry work that
goes with it on the side (the part that goes along the passenger rear
side of the car. (Also includes that roof shelf). Another thing I thought
I'd mention is... well, I found one in the junkyard, and it has all of
these pieces in GOOD shape. I'm considering buying them, but I just don't
have the time this weekend (or the means to get it there). I can't drive
my bus long distances until I get that steering damper. In any case, I
guess what I'm asking is.. what am I giving up here, are these pieces
easy to come-by?


Thanks!

Todd
