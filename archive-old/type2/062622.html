&gt; Hi all
&gt; I have all the materials to begin my body work on the
&gt; cargo floor. I have also decided to goaround to all the
&gt; surface rust on the exterior and remove it and prime. Here
&gt; is my question. If I did all the exterior body work and
&gt; primed the whole vehicle, should this significantly reduce
&gt; the price of a paint job. Also, would it be worth the price
&gt; reduction considering my lack of experience and that I will
&gt; be using canned primer?

Fixing the body should reduce the cost of the bodywork, but it won't 
help with the cost of a new paintjob. I've taken the effort of doing 
that same job, and put primer/surfacer on all properly sanded body 
surfaces, followed by block sanding. When done, I used sealer, sanded, 
and sealed again, until it was ready for paint. Some of the body shops 
said they would charge me MORE because they had to remove the primer. 
They said they couldn't guarantee the finish, because they would have to 
remove all the primer, and redo the job. I finally ended up painting the 
rig myself... 'cause I couldn't see paying them $2K for 4 hour's work.

&gt; My van has some hail damage on the roof. Probobly about
&gt; 20 pings. Can I fill these with bondo and sand them off or
&gt; do they need cut out and replaced?

If these are mild dents, you can use body filler (bondo), properly 
applied. Don't remove metal, unless it's required to fix cancer-rust.

You'll want to pick up a good book on this subject. There are several 
available... or you can probably check one out from the library... and 
even some of the mechanical repair books have a body repair section in 
them.

Do not apply body filler over rust or paint. The finish should be ground 
down with a course grit grinding disk (40 grit is usually used). This 
offers the bondo something to cling to. You can pull out any dent 1/2&quot; 
deep. To do this, holes are punched every couple inches in the low 
portions, and a slide hammper puller is used to slip the dent back out, 
working from one hole the the next. When finished, tip the slide puller 
45 degrees to one side. This takes up some of the &quot;stretch&quot; in the 
metal, and stops it from vibrating the filler loose.  BTW, the holes 
also allow you to work filler in, so it holds that much better. 
Sometimes people will punch holes in smaller dents, just for the added 
cling (I don't usually bother, if the dent is small).

You'll be applying a generous amount of filler to the damage, avoiding 
bubbles when mixing and applying the plastic. Work it in with a 
spreader, and apply more than you need to fill the hole. When the 
surface is cured, but still soft (this takes a &quot;feel&quot;, but you can 
scratch the surface with your finger), use a &quot;cheese grater&quot; (an open 
poured file) to remove most of the excess. It should &quot;grate&quot; just like 
aged cheese. The final amount is removed using an open faced body file. 
40 grit paper is used to begin working the filler to shape, followed by 
finer paper (80 or 100), and is mounted on a sanding board.

Once the final finish is achieved, primer surfacer is applied to fill 
the minor flaws, and is sanded smooth.
