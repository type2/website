       I ran a 009 for a short while in my '69 upright engine, then
switched to a 050 -- but I also had removed the stock oil cooler and put
an adaptor plate for a large external cooler in it's place. Thus, I had
no need for the #3 retard lobe on the 009 (the stock cooler on those
upriight engines blocks the air flow to #3).
       That was long ago and far away, but I was pretty happy with the
050 in that installation. I also used 009 dizzys in the numerous baja
bugs I ran back then. When I got my '73, it came with a Weber, and I
promptly installed a 050, thinking it was the thing to do, and kept it
when I put a '81 engine in my '73, but after becoming a little more
acquainted with the T4 engine, I decided to forgo the Weber and 050 and
installed FI and the stock '81 dizzy. It works much, much better.
      While the 050 might have more advance than the 009, it still isn't
enough advance for the T4 engine. If you look at Bentley's, you'll see
that the stock T4 dizzys have around 25-26 degrees advance with the
centrifigal alone, and another 12 degrees with the vacuum, plus the 7.5
degrees of initial advance setting. And that's just stock -- performance
tuners always bump that up a bit.
       Someone else wrote me recently about using a T4 stock dizzy with
a T1 engine --- don't.
