Subject: [T2] Harmonic vibration in shifter
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hello all!

     First off it's a 79 bus 2.0l fi. with EMPI trigger type shifter.
Okay now when I'm driving at a steady pace, most of the time 35 mph in
third I get a harmonic sounding vibration traveling up my shifter, It
shifts smoothly, no tranny problems, no popping out of gear.  SO what is
causing this? Any info will be great! 
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
