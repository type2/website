Subject: [T2] Steering Gearbox --Type 2 Bus 68-71 Part#211 415 049 FX

Does anyone need/want a steering box.

I just received a rebuilt steering box from RMMW--  includes their lifetime
warranty, $216.00 w/no core charge, and I  pay the shipping.

I don't need it for the 71 resto that I sold last week.
Their catalog price for it is:  $294.95 + shipping...............
