Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window update 

Brazing is like soldering, only lots hotter and you
use brazing rod, not solder -- though cheapskates will
make do with a coat hanger.  Bright metal is a must,
and there is no flux.  Dissimilar metals can be joined
but, unlike welding, there is no literal fusion of the
dissimilar metals -- think of it as metal glue not
two-becoming-one.  If you use a torch, MAPP gas might
be hot enough but I use Oxy-Acetylene.  Because the
parts have to be hot enough to, like soldering, melt
the brazing rod by contact with the hot metal, it won't
typically be something you do except after isolating
the parts you plan to heat (to cherry red).

Disclaimer, I do this sort of thing not to my bus
but to farm equipment which is forgiving of my lack
of training in fine detail and/or cosmetics.
