Subject: Re: [T2] really stupid

&lt;&lt;On my 72 some of the zerks refuse to take grease. Is removing and
replacing them the only solution? I am reluctant to try this as they
often break off rather than unscrew.&gt;&gt;

John, 

There is a tool known a grease driver just for this very job.

You load it with grease and give it a wack with a hammer.
It has been known to break the crud outa the fitting's ans make them
servicable again.

The only problem here is the tool will destroy the rusted up spring
behind the ball of the zerk.
The next favorite thing to do is heat the area up around the zerk, and
then they will usually back right out.

The best deal here is to replace them.
