Subject: aftermath of overheated engine

Hi all,
        Last week I posted a message about the aftermath of my overheated
engine which was due to the fan belt selfdestructing on the freeway and me
not noticing until the oil temp guage was pegged.  Besides really out of
adjustment valves, the only problem I could detect was a thundering noise
when I accelerated, sounded sort of like a bad muffler.  Several people
wrote back telling me the same thing: that my heads were loose.  So I
pulled the engine and sure enough all of the head nuts were really loose. 
So I retorqued them and now the noise is gone.  I'd like to thank everyone
who wrote me for the good advice.  I have case savers in the case, and
only one of my studs looked like it might have been pulling out but it
ended up holding. 
        I have another question for the group.  How long can you keep a vw
running?  My '69 bus has got 181,000 miles on it and besides a new engine,
misc. carb., generator, CV joints, batteries, brakes, front wheel
bearings, and a few other small things over the last 10 yrs., it seems to
be running o.k..  I'm waiting for the tranny, front end, steering box, and
master cylinder to go, but they haven't yet.  How many miles are on the
other buses out there?  Who's got the record?

John
