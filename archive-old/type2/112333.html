&gt; Here's a Friday topic for everyone....... Is it okay to drink alcohol
&gt; inside the bus when you're parked?

&gt; What do you all think about this?

I expect that if they wanted to &quot;get you on something&quot; they could 
probably hassle you and/or charge you with something for having an open 
container, even if not driving.  I think the key is to show respect and 
be calm and these things generally work out fine.

I have heard (way back in the 90s) that there are states where if you 
are in a motor vehicle and all parties in the car (or just you if 
you're the only driver) have been drinking, you're screwed -- 
regardless of where the keys are, etc.  If there is any truth to this, 
it comes down to the officer's judgement and therefore in part how you 
respond to the situation.

Myself, I wouldn't worry about it if I wasn't planning on going 
anywhere, but I also wouldn't rule out the chance of having a problem 
if someone wanted to be a dick.

as usual, YMMV.
