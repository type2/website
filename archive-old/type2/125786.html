Subject: Greetings and my first question...or two.

Happy Friday!  Just a quick intro before getting to the meat of this
email.  My name's Hogan, I live out in Northern Arizona where it doesn't
get so hot.  Just picked up my first air-cooled VW last week, woo!  78
Westy, the price:  Free.  Happy to be here, it's a fun project.

Anyway, the problem I'm having that's bugging me the most is a
stumble/misfire at part throttle under load.  It can be somewhat
intermittent, but is there 90% of the time.  The engine revs fine in
neutral and most of the time the problem will go away under full
throttle, but not always.  Feels like a hard miss, it'll start bucking
about mid throttle and midway through the RPM range.  The two things
that come to mind are bad fuel since it did sit for at least a year or
the air flow meter.  I did some searching through the archives but
didn't come across anything that really addressed the problem I'm
having, so hopefully someone out there can give me some direction.  I've
gone through about one tank of fuel since picking it up and it does run
a LOT better now in general, but this bucking miss has got to stop.

Also, I've been getting the smell of raw fuel after I first start
driving it and if I go on curvy roads, but driving down the highway the
smell goes away.  Thinking maybe a hole/crack in the fuel tank
somewhere?  I'll have to poke around and look, but I wouldn't think this
would tie into the bucking problem.

Sorry for the long email, hope everyone has a great Friday!
