 Subject: [T2] sticking valves

&gt; I recently purchased a new engine from bap and after running it locally for
&gt; 100 miles or so I decided to take it on a 2 hour drive on the thruway. The
&gt; exhaust valve on number 2 must have stuck and the end of the pushrod on the
&gt; lifter got smooshed in. After replacing it and driving home by the time I got
&gt; home the thing was running awful. So I pulled the covers and cylinder 3 and 4
&gt; both had the same problem. What is causing this and if it the valves sticking
&gt; why do they stick.

 1) Incorrect valve / guide clearance- Lack of attention to detail
     during engine building process, guides must be reamed to size.
 2) Wrong guide material- the guides may be steel and not bronze.
 3) Defect in oil delivery- restriction in bearing circuit or defective
      oil pump, pressure control piston, oil is not getting where it should.
 4) Improper engine oil for ambient temperatures.
 5) High ambient temperature ( it was Hot today ).
 6) Sustained high speed driving above 65 mph.
 7) Don't continue driving when there is an obvious serious problem.

 Those pushrods got very hot, and so did the rest of the engine.
It's time for gauges-Verify idle and operating oil pressure / temperature.
Change the oil and check the strainer.
Check the timing and verify fuel for no lean condition.
Call BAP and check the warranty.
