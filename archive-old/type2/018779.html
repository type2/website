Subject: teenagers and busses...con't
Message-ID: &lt;378BACC5.E716FD4_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

ok guys...speak for yourself..
I'm 16 on July 26th (presents anyone? jk!) and looked around for a bus
for a couple of months before finally eyeing up Stella.  I bought her
with $900 of cold hard cash that I worked my little behind off for.
When I got into bussing (bought Stella) I had been on the list getting a
little know-how on how everything works/where it is/what to look for.  I
treat her with more respect than I treat many human beings.  She hasn't
done anything to hurt me (except for gouge my thumb, she was just
telling me not to mess with something that isn't broken :-) )  Ever
since I bought her and have had her in my driveway she has been getting
more and more lively.  I have been researching and asking questions and
filling my head (and annoying my girlfriend) with Volkswagen bus stuff.
I think that I have learned a tremendous amount of stuff about busses.
I now know how to do most stuff from take an engine out to change a
tire.  I'm not bragging but I definitely think that I deserve Stella.
I'm really not offended by all of your statements, because there are a
lot of *idiots* that make comments about my bus and ask the same stupid
questions (&quot;Can I buy it for 200 bucks?&quot; come on man! thats a deal!
I'll even give you my old escort if you want! Hows that for a trade?
Ok, how about a Playstation?? Come on man!&quot;) and I can see where your
coming from.  But you MUST realize that teenagers are not all the same.
You are as old as you think you are.....in most cases.  Nobody EVER
guesses that I'm 16.  Its always 19+...always
and oh yeah....busses (especially westies!) are great to have for
certain backseat/bed reasons.... ahem ahem!
hopefully my children will enjoy busses as much as I do.....but I think
my girlfried is going to kill me if I don't stop talking about
Stella....or stop working on her all hours of the day! hehe....
priorities?
ha
anyways...
anyone care to comment?
