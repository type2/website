Hi Christopher

To answer your questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  How many of you folks illogically believe in original
&gt; instrumentation?

I think instrumentation is essential to follow closely on engine state. If
i can find better instruments than the original and it is not difficult 
with 30 years old instruments, I lay my phylos.. aside and install &quot;modern
instruments. I think my phylo.. is that if you want to keep your vehicle
safely and securely on the road, a little modification(s) and/or
adaptations from the original is not a sin... (wow, will that shake the
fondations of the VPM (Volkswagen Purist Movement...)? ;-|

&gt; 2.  How many of you folks are currently driving your bus in need of a 
&gt;repair (...snip...)

 So much in need now (floor replacement, bodywork, front
wheel bearing, and what else... heating... etc...), that I have to do them
before I toke it on the road for a real trip. By the way, my steering is
correct :-). Problem is, with VW busses, the more you work on it, the more
you find something to do...
