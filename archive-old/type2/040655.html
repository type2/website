Subject: odd acelleration hiccup at speed

I recently replaced my 30/31 pict with my faithfull 30pict1, but it is
doing something weird - at around 45 or so, it abruptly slows down and
seems like I dropped a valve! Checked it out - no prob; took off and it
accellerates like nothing happened. Did it AGAIN on the way home.
I am running a 1600 stocker, jets are 125/125/.55. The ONLY thing I can
think of is maybe the choke is flopping around and cutting off the throat
at certain vacuum levels; I would have expected a swallowed accell tube to
have ment no accell....
Anything else to look for?
