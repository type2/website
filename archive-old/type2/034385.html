Subject: Original or Conversion?

Last week I was casually looking at a mildly converted '77 bus for sale here
in the Chicago area and could not determine whether it was done by a PPO or
&quot;pro&quot;.  Exterior is all standard: hard top; standard windows.  Interior
mildly converted:  Full width convertible bench seat; pedestal cabinet on
drivers side with sink/manual pump; pedestal storage cabinet on passenger
side.  Both pedestals lower than bottom of windows.  Padded soffits (?)
where walls and ceiling meet.  

More of concern with this conversion is the absence of the bulkheads
(dividers) behind driver's and passenger's seats.  In place of these I found
triangular braces (3&quot; - 4&quot;) welded at floor level behind the seats.
Original or converted?  Good thing or bad?  I get a nice warm feeling
reading/hearing about how VW designers over-engineered the structure of the
bus.  I get nervous thinking that a converter or PPO thought they knew more
than VW.

If this bus remains a candidate, I'll be back with more questions on Midwest
rust in all the usual places.  But for now, thanks in advance for the
feedback.
