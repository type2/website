Subject: Re: [T2] DIY tent patterns?

Hello Anton

I did my own roof tent for a 1977 Westy , I took out the old one (you have 
to do it in order to put the new one anyway), since it was good enough I 
performed a wash machine cycle, after that I dissasemble it all appart and 
then ironed, all previos was to work with out any dust and to obtain a 
better fit.
I used the old one as apattern in a piece of sumbrela canvas,you should have 
in mind that when you wash a pice of cloth, it will shrink a little so let a 
little margin and cut the new pieces a little bigger, and  I said a little 
not to have a saggi tent, then I took it to an upholstery shop to be sweing 
doble stich in each corner.
The results was pretty amaizing and of course a lot cheap then a new one, I 
have some picts of the final product in my site so if you want to take a 
look please be my gest. I must say that this was my first canvas ever so if 
you are handy man a play atttention to the details you will suit your golas 
for sure.

Greetings

Roberto
