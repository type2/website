Please excuse my ignorance but reading through all these mails, which I
think are relevant to the list, I still have not found what this is all
about.

Is VWoA protecting their copyright in T-shirts and other merchandise that
does not really bother us much OR are they trying to shut down companies
like RMMW etc depriving the classic VW community from parts that are NLA at
the VW counter.

Without that bit of information I don't think all the VW bashing is very
relevant.

Note that in Europe many users of the letters VW have a very good working
relationship with VW and for instance PON (still the official VW reps in
Holland). They are even sponsoring VW-Euro (see http://www.vweuro.nl) and
other VW clubs that carry the letter VW in their name.
