Subject: New MOT &amp; New Bus !

First - Ashley got his new MOT last Friday, and it only cost me 15 pounds worth
of (top quality) welding, not the 300+ for work the last two years have been
!!!!!

Sorry, I'm just pleased with that as it must mean he is getting better, maybe no
re-test next time ? Actually I did have to get the sliding door done, but he was
bookied in for that anyway. Strangely thoug, one of the sidelight bulbs failed
and the next day was working fine ??? A self healing bus ? Pity he can't do that
for rust ! Did have a service and replace a sticky handbrake cable as well
though. Sounds good, I'm now using him for work while my bug has it's front
suspension replaced. It is fun driving looking over hedges again.

However I went to BVF at Malvern (in Ashley) last weekend and saw a new Type 2,
fitted out by Devon. Good quality fitting, not much like the 70's versions
though. Still left hand drive but I understand it will be converted. One
interesing point - NO BELLY PANS, even though there is a pop top. The water tank
is a rectangular item from CAK tanks in Kenilworth, England (I wrote to them and
asked) that would not fit under the pans. I have photos and will scan them in if
anyone fancy's hosting them on a web page.

Excellent show, I only bought 1 rusty bit of junk, a T2 wheel with slight
surface rust that is now cleaned and painted (did it at the same time as the bug
front beam) and will live in the shed as the &quot;wheel for when the tyre place
won't put rubber on a rusty wheel&quot; spare, only cost me a pount though.
BVF is a lovely event, also saw 4 New Beetles (Yuk) 5 if you count the new
Mexican RHD one (Brill). Even a friend who is not a VW enthusiast enjoyed it.

Finally, I bought a door handle intending to follow the instructions on the list
a few moths ago for removing and rearanging the lovk for a different key.
Trouble is I can't dismantle the barrel and the archives don't give any explicit
instructions. Anyon any ideas ?

TIA
