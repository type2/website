Subject: Votage regulator is Hot
Date: Mon, 31 Jul 2000 18:36:17 -0500
Encoding: 10 TEXT

For months my volt meter on my 74 westy has been showing a charging level 
of 12 volts, and that is with no lights, brakes, radio, etc. turned on. 
 With any accessories on the level would go to 11, 10, and so on, depending 
on if it was night, raining, etc.  I swapped voltage regulators from my 75 
bus, and when I drove around a few miles and the level was up to 13 or so. 
 However, when I touched the voltage regulator upon returning home, it was 
fairly hot, and when I started the vehicle, the charging level seemed to be 
lower than when I first swapped regulators.  Is the regulator supposed to 
get hot during operation?  If not, any clues as to what to look for.  Thank 
you, Joel Lambert, Atmore, Alabama.
