on home, and the needle continues to do the same. I get to my driveway,

I had the identical experience with my pressure guage. Very unsettling. When
 I pulled over and looked I found that the nut securing the wire to the
sender had worked loose allowing intermittant contact and thus the wildly
fluctuating needle.
