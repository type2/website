Subject: Re: [T2] Parts engine

&gt;One final question - is there only way to test the mechanical fuel pump
&gt;other then putting it on a bus and going for it?

I have had some experiences with the '72-'74 mechanical fuel pump.  This is the pump for carb engines.  It's task is to convey fuel from the gas tank to the bowl(s) in the carb(s), and to not overwhelm the float valve with over pressure which may lead to flooding the carbs.  This requires almost no pressure at all, something like 5 psi.  It is actuated by a shaft that rides along a cam on the crankshaft and is located near the starter on the front (front is front) passenger side.  Muir and the green book both say that the engine must be removed to service this pump, but that is not true, one needs only move part of the cooling tin.

I have found these pumps to be expensive to buy new, I see them only at Germansupply_dot_com in Toronto currently for about $200, so hang on to it, the old ones are valuable, at least to me.

I have found these pumps to be quite tough and easy to make work.

To test, I would just connect if to a fuel supply and actuate the thing with my thumb.  The pressure is going to be regulated by the k of the spring, as it does not push the fuel when actuated, rather the spring pushes the fuel when released.  With no back pressure, it will squirt fuel 20' of so.  It is located below the gas tank, so it will not have to suck the fuel in, but it can anyway.  I have had two of these leak, but that was only because the screws got loose, and they stopped leaking when tightened.  The diaphragms are constructed of really tough stuff.

It seems that these are also good pumps to use with weber carbs.
