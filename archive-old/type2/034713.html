Subject: Re: looking for the flawess engine?!!

&gt;This
&gt;is my 2nd VW but my first rebuild and I want to leave nothing to chance!

No chance of that! All you can do is minimize the variables and hope for
the best. There's a chance that your mechanic will drop a diamond from his
nose-ring into the engine and it'll sit in the bottom until you crest
Grants Pass... ;-0 Okay, sorry...I couldn't resist. After that smart
comment, you deserve some ideas:

Keep it cool. Keep it clean. I don't use synthetics like Bob, but I do
change oil and filters regularly. I install VDO temp and pressure
senders/guages in every bus and monitor enough to keep it in range (below
230 F degrees--certainly below 250F; variable pressure depending on RPMs,
but never below 12, even at a hot idle). A vacuum gauge is another good
tool for monitoring your engine's health, but I don't have one and really
don't know how to use one. Eventually you have to stop being anal about
monitoring though; otherwise, you'll slam into someone on the highway cause
you're looking in the wrong direction...took some time for me, and I'm sure
I missed some good sights along the way.

A good tuneup is essential as well. If your mechanic does a good job of
putting everything within specs and you do a good job of keeping everything
from getting out of whack (cool, clean, and tuned up), there's no reason
you can't get 200,000 out of your engine. Dumb luck can do you in, though:
a flawed part; a rock bouncing back onto a pushrod tube; an idiot at the
jiffy lube. Minimizing risks is a good thing...JiffyLube baaaaad.

As for the 93 grade, just don't let it ping.

Again, you're getting advice well worth the price you paid. :) Joe
