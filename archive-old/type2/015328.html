&gt;	Tim,
&gt;	You're completely correctly about errors, it IS wonderful
&gt;to try to correct them. :) Ah well, can't be right without
&gt;being wrong first. My heart agrees with you about carry-on-board
&gt;spares but my head says keep the spare fan belt, points and condensor,
&gt;the removed-but-still-working cap and rotor from the last tune-up, 
&gt;a couple of CV bolts, clutch and accelerator cable. 

I agree in the main, and I accept that we all make errors. I've made
some dillies so I know I'm fallable. That is why I have honored as
best I can a system of thought and action that helps to diminish
the frequency of error. Elimination of mistakes is possable. What's
a mistake??? That's an error you make that somebody other than you
pays for. If you know you have to pay for it, you try very hard
to think about method of prevention.

&gt;	My own experience suggests that condensors can die suddenly,
&gt;(Two so far in my lifetime), that fan belts can fail unexpectedly 
&gt;(1 in the last 500,000 miles of personal experience). And for the
&gt;rest, yep, I could do regular inspections more often, I know. When
&gt;I had a Rabbit, which consumed fuse pannels, I carried a spare
&gt;fuse pannel and a kludge circuit to jump around the pannel
&gt;so I didn't have to replace IT to get moving again. Every 50,000
&gt;miles or so it would fail.

Yeah, those Wabbit fuze blocks are a pain. My experience is that only
80% of them will last 20 years. That's not a very good rate for German
engineering.
&gt;
&gt;I've been stopped by bad point gaps twice, a mysterious condensor/
&gt;rotor/cap problem, shorted ignition primary wire from dealership that
&gt;fixed the mysterious problem (and couldn't expain what had been wrong),
&gt;burned out Rabbbit fuse pannels twice, 

&gt;	I've limped to service from four loss-of-coolant events, 
&gt;a failed fan belt and a self-destructing Bus engine.

With rare exception, failure can be anticipated if you know what to
look for and YOU ACTUALLY LOOK. Periodically. Uncompromisingly.
Consistantly. With a vengence. 

&gt;
&gt; But never stranded for more than a few hours. 


Question is, do you feel that the above rate of failure is unreasonable???
If yes, what can be reasonably done to reduce the incidence.
If not, carry on.

and

Thank you for the feedback.
