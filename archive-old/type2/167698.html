&gt; &gt; &gt; I did the exact process that Bentley describes and officially have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; brakes I had when I removed all the fluid.

may be the  problemm, you removed all the fluid...

&gt; &gt; repeat, still air in the lines.

&gt; &quot;If you stomp first and your reservoir is low you may introduce air into the
&gt; master cylinder then you'll have to bench bleed it.&quot; - Ratwell_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; Could I have done this as well? I noticed that Richard suggests going from
&gt; the back first to the front where Bentley was opposite.

yes I always do furtherest to closest I think Bentley may be wrong
here.

also if I change all my fluid I just put fresh in and bleed and bleed
and bleed until the new fluid comes thru. never letting the system get
exposed to the air.

the first cyl seems to take forever but after the first one the
others are much faster.

Good luck
Bob
