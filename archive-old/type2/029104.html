.  I look in back and all the hoses had become disconnected!  Wierd!

Pranksters I suspect.  The first thing I would do is get a key lock on your
engine lid if you don't already have one.  I wouldn't be surprised if
tomorrow morning all the hoses are off and something else is awry.  I had
problems a few years ago and someone was continually messing around in my
engine compartment even took my coil.  Once while out of state taking nap in
24hr walmart parking lot I heard two guys talking about how easy it would be
to reach in my engine compartment and yank some wires to leave me stranded.
I quietly crawled to the front and started her up and drove off.  I hope I'm
wrong,  Mark
