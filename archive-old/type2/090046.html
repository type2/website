&gt; We spent some time this week pulling the engine from my '83 vanagon.  Things

&gt; have any advice here?

Ed,

There is no nut there on a T4.  The &quot;nut&quot; is a steel insert pressed inot
that corener of the case.  the bolt head you need to unscrew, rom
underneath, is indeed pretty inaccessible, but with a 17mm socket on a 6&quot;
extension, it is reachable.

&gt; Also I'm really not happy with the condition of the tin.  The firewall tin
&gt; is bent to hell, and the stuff on the bottom is rusted very badly.  I think
&gt; I can repair some of it but I am definitely going to have to replace some of
&gt; it.  Bus boys lists the items I need in their catalog.  Any other suggestions?
&gt; Bus Depot doesn't have it, unfortunately.

The secret is to fly to California, go to a junk yard, and pull it off
yourself.  It will be ~$50 + $200 airfare (if you find a good sale...  $75
if you wait til September and fly Southwest's intro offer).  Probably
buying it piece by piece, you would rack up that much from a mail order
house (and you miss the trip to CA :-)
