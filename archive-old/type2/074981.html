Subject: Re: [T2] Check out this bus with a VERY rare option

Here in new england i have seen far worse go for a lot more, i cringe when i hear
people say &quot;free RUST FREE bus going to crusher &quot; , you spoiled sun belt people
that can junk a rust free bus , ship them up here and make big bucks.

&gt;   I suppose the engine and tranny are
&gt; worth something, but $1200.00?  What a joke.
&gt; But, hey, those windows look pretty nice.
