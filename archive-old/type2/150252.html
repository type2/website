Subject: Your TCWBC Subscriptsoin is ready

Do you find yourself wanting to sleep in the westy again?
Do you wonder what FMBC Breakfast Burritos taste like in the winter?
Do you sometimes wish that spring would just hurry up and get here  
already?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, ask your doctor or VW  
mechanic about the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout.

Get your dose on February 18th, 2006 at Valens Conservation Area.

TCWBC is the safe, natural way to feel better and more confident  
about your bus during the long cold months of winter . TCWBC can help  
ease you out of your bus withdrawal and put you back in touch with  
the Bus friends that you haven't seen since Fall.

You will notice the benefits of TCWBC almost immediately, as the  
warmth of the campfire and the camaraderie of frozen bus pilots  
forces a smile to your frozen jaw. With a regimen of annual doses you  
can overcome any obstacles that prevent you from living the life you  
want to live.

TCWBC may not be right for everyone. People who are allergic to fun  
or going outside should not use TCWBC. People who cannot camp without  
swarms of insects should not attend TCWBC. However, bus pilots who  
can't wait until Everybus and can't afford a trip to Florida are  
encouraged to try it.

Side effects may include loss of sleep (staying up late at the  
campfire), a desire for Breakfast Burritos in the morning, and an  
increased appreciation of the comforts of home.
