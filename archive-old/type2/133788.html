Subject: RE: [T2] PaintFest

That was my idea but if the posts are coming from everyone and not all can 
use the site then I could not send the pages. Or I could but I would have to 
leave out some peoples entries, etc. If you could host this that would be 
awesome. But it could become a part time job for you. I don't know how much 
access you could or would give up to the public. Sounds like a start process 
of elimination.

I dont mind throwing it up on my site.. link would be something
like:
www.firestrike_dot_net/paintfest/paintfest.htm
or something like that (the link above isn't set up).

You can just send me pages/updates already done in htm to slap
up. Easy as pie.
