Dan,

 Welcome to the Bus blessed people....

If you have checked the fan belt and found it to be tight and not making
noises it's time for step 2: The coal brushes in the alternator. On the top
of the alternator you can see a round socket with wires going to a relay.
Disconnect the battery leads and pull the socket off.  Then loosen the
screws holding the socket on the alternator. When you pull it out you
should see the coal brushes hanging out on the under side (or what's left
of them). They should be hanging in short copper wires soldered to the
socket. Around the wires there should be small springs, similar to those in
a pen. 
If the coal brushes are very short the don't connect properly to the copper
rings on the rotor in the alternator. The copper rings should have a smooth
surface without deep scrathes. If they are badly scratched the coal brushes
will wear out fast. To check the rings in a bus with an upright engine you
need to have a very flat head:-) If you don't, use a mirror and a
flashlight instead.

Most FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Shop) have the coal brushes. You need
a soldering iron to get them changed, just heat up till the old ones comes
off and solder in the new ones. Don't forget those springs:-)

Can't help you on the octane question, think we have a different octane
system here. We have 95, 98 and 99 octane gasoline........... 

On the horn question I can only say that all busses have their own
identity, if it not is a  problem just learn to live with it:-)

&gt;Hi Bus Friends,
&gt;
&gt;I recently bought a bus, and have been getting it in daily driver 
&gt;condition (Eric, Barb, and Clara have been incredible with their help). 
&gt;
&gt;My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red 
&gt;light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but 
&gt;better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving. 
&gt;However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually 
&gt;doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright 
&gt;enough to notice during the day.
&gt;
&gt;Should I be suspicious of a belt, or should I start elsewhere (or just 
&gt;not worry about it)?
&gt;
&gt;Also, on another topic, I don't want to start a holy war, but what is the 
&gt;best kind of fuel to put in my bus (i.e. octane) and is it important to 
&gt;use a lead substitute? (I understand that there is a concern for engine 
&gt;wear when some grades of unleaded are used.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all,
&gt;
&gt;Dan
&gt;
&gt;P.S. I don't know if this is relevant, but I've noticed that the horn 
&gt;doesn't want to work when I first start up (and this is when the light 
&gt;seems to be the brightest). At other times, it seems to work fine, once 
&gt;the bus is &quot;warmed up.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me,
