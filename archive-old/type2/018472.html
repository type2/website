&gt; &gt; If the engine does start, power to the
&gt; &gt; fuel pump is sustained by a set of contacts in the air flow meter that
&gt; &gt; close when the AFM flap deflects due to the incoming air.  But if the
&gt; &gt; engine dies, the flap closes and the contacts are opened, fuel pump
&gt; &gt; shuts off.
&gt; 
&gt; I know Sean knows what he's talking about, but mine doesn't work like this. I've got my engine starting only &gt;breifly and then dying, but when it dies, the fuel pump continues running. I checked the AFM flap by hand a &gt;while back and the spring to make it close is intact. What else should I suspect? Faulty double relay? &gt;Incorrect wiring?


Joe,
You may be on to something there.  Steve Dolan's '73 w/ '78 FI sometimes
does this exact same thing and when it does it also doesn't start or
start very well.  On his, when it does this, the only way to shut off
the fuel pump is to disconnect the battery.  Weird.  

Unfortunately I don't know what the problem is but possibly the double
relay or some sort of wiring problem creating a feedback loop of some
sort.  

You may wish to troubleshoot the double relay per the instructions in
Bentley, maybe it will shed some light on your problem.  Also inspect
your wiring and make sure it jibes with your wiring diagram.
