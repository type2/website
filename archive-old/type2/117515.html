&gt; Hello again.  Thanks to everyone who responded with
&gt; good ideas for us to try on Isabella, our new '72 bus.
&gt; So, we checked spark from the coil again, and it IS
&gt; getting spark.  Don't know how we missed that the
&gt; first time.  Anyway, then we moved on to the
&gt; distributor, and (actually a friend did this part),
&gt; there is no spark, AND the rotor inside the dist. 
&gt; moves, turns.... is it supposed to do that????? 

yes to a point, it goes round and rouund when the engine is turning
to check spark from dist, put on cap and pull a spark plug wire, put a
screw driver in the center so it touches the contact in the center LAY IT
DOWN ON THE engine with about 1/4 - 1/2 inche between the metal shaft and
a grounded part of the engine, DON'T TOUCH IT, crank the engine there
should be a spark between the metal shaft and the ground.

&gt; Someone responded that the body of the dist. should
&gt; not turn, and it doesn't, but what about the rotor???
&gt; Please help again.  You were all so helpful last time.
&gt;  It feels good to be a part of a big family like this!
&gt; Do you guys think we are going to have to replace the
&gt; dist.???

maybe

&gt;  And if so, you have to do a complete engine
&gt; overhaul for that, right?   YIKES!

no it slides in and out without touchingg the engine, just one bolt hold
it
