Hi Folks,

I'm posting for a friend today who's curious about spark plug heat ranges 
for his '69 Bus.  He has a 1600DP with single carb and dual-vacuum dizzy.  
His #3 plug is burning a bit (whitish deposits on insulator/electrode; other 
plugs seem fine), and he'd like to run a colder plug in #3 only.

Do all 4 plugs need to be the same heat range?
Will a colder plug foul in cold weather when the mixture is rich?

Any info or answers can be sent to the list (type2_at_type2_dot_com), to me 
(jzupper_at_hotmail_dot_com), or to him (mmcquilton_at_silvertreehotel_dot_com).

Thanks!
