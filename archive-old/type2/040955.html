Forgive me if this doesn't apply to the Type 4, but my deck height tool
is simply a piece of flat steel I picked up at my local scrap yard.  I
marked the position of 2 studs, drilled the 2 holes on a drill press and
put a 3rd hole in the middle.  The depth gauge of my calipers goes into
the middle hole and I subtract the thickness of the plate.  I did find
some error from one piston to the other using this method then I
realized the caliper was not striking the pistons at the same place
because I was flipping the plate when changing cylinders.  Now I just
rotate the plate to clear the adjacent head studs keeping the same side
up.   You must consider this before drilling the holes.  I use some old
standard sockets to take up space on the head studs and torque to spec. 
Is that clear as mud?
