I am a dumb s**t.

Okay, I wanted to support my local tire store, so I called, asking for
195-75R14 in load range D.  I tell him it's for a VW bus.  He says they can
get Firestone Wilderness HT, which are light truck tires.  Hypothetically.

He put 'em on yesterday afternoon.  Driving Maureen home, the tires don't
feel any different from the crappy worn-out passenger tires originally on
there.  I look at them when I get home.  ONE ply sidewall.  1400 lb load
max.  ARRGHHH!!

I'm royally PO'ed.  Look up the tire at Tirerack.  Yep, it's classified as a
light truck tire all right.  Jeez.  Who makes up these classifications?

Another $50 would have got me some stiff-sidewall tires worthy of the name
&quot;truck tire&quot;.

Moral:  accept no substitutes.  Your local dealer MAY know wherein he
speaks...but you can't count on it.  Go with this list's opinion on tires.

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;, who would like to be wearing Yokohama 360's...
