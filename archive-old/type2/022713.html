Jim Mowreader offered:
&gt;&gt; It's almost easier. There is a lever under the front of the seat that
lifts up; this lets you adjust the position of the seat. Lift the lever up
and pull the seat forward until it comes off the rails. &lt;&lt;

I thought this lever is what opened the rear heat vent? How many controls
are supposed to be under there in a '68? (I only see two, the lever and the
big wheel) If this seat does in fact slide on rails, mine are rusted stuck.
Time for liberal use of penetrating oil I guess.  It would be nice to fit my
long legs back from the steering wheel a little more.  Thanks!
