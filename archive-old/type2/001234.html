wow! wholly cow! we all know whats in store for rasdave after reading that!
:) that was some good reading my friend, thanks!

my bus is an ongoing project, i havent put the preperation work into mine
like you have...its more of a drive and if something breaks i fix it bus.
once the engine broke on me so i fix it, then the fan housing broke off, so
i fix it...i can go on and on but you get the picture.

its cool to do things our own way, i wish i had the skill and patience
required to do it your ways. in the end we are all happy driving our buses
around and smiling :)

kindest regards, rasdave :)
