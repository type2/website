Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

From: &quot;Access Systems&quot; &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt;
&gt; does the old fuel pump work...

Don't know.  Just happened to notice it on the engine.

&gt; and the stock fuel pump in a carbed engine is mechanical on the engine, or
if FI then it is electric under the bus.

This one is on the engine on the bottom toward the front on the starter side
of the block.  It looks like the one on the upper right-hand side of fiche#
013-00, but it's mounted horizonally (not vertically, like on the fiche).

&gt; if FI then the pump already has the relay just make sure it is wired
correctly.

I'm not sure that the original FI relay is still in the bus.  I'm thinking
of adding on to be safe.
