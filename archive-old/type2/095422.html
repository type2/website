Subject: Help finding steering column parts

Volks,

After changing out the loose front end of the drag link on my '71, as well 
as the damper, I still have considerable movement in the steering column. 
However, the movement is less steering box freeplay than it is front-to-back 
and side-to-side movement of the steering column within its tube.

I understand there is a bearing and a bushing within the column tube that 
buffers movement of the column. I was told that in most cases, wear in the 
bushing is often responsible for the column's movement. Does that jive with 
the experience out there?

Is anyone aware of a source for the bushing and/or bearing? I have been 
unable to locate them through the usual parts sources and am assuming they 
are NLA from VW. Can anyone help finding NOS or good used parts?

Thanks in advance,
Mick McQuilton
