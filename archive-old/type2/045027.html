Subject: [T2] Calling Rob Laffoon

Sorry for the public post but I badly need to get in touch with Rob Laffoon
concerning our trip to BNNTA.  I believe he is headed to Tulsa to pick up a
new bus.  I have his cell phone but it apparently isn't on.  If anyone
knows how to contact him, please get in touch with me.

Thanks,

-David (off to BNNTA!!!!!!!)
