Peach State Transporters has a few upcoming trips in the next 
couple of weekends if anyone is interested.

This Friday night we will be camping near Commerce, GA.  I have 
to talk to Allen Becker to get details on the campground, and I 
will post the details when I get them.  We will be attending the 
&quot;Georgia Jamboree&quot; (or whatever it is called) that Tommy Denton 
is having on Saturday.  PLEASE NOTE that this is a VW show with 
drag racing and they WILL be charging about $10 for attendance to 
cover insurance for racing whether you give a flip about drag 
racing or not (I don't). 

Several of us will go from there to camp in north Georgia at 
Amicalola Falls State Park (if there are campsites left!) Saturday 
night.

Next Friday, November 8, we will be caravaning to Tampa, Florida 
for Mike Brown's 3rd annual Bulli Brigade, which will happen on 
Saturday.  Saturday afternoon &amp; early evening we will be going to 
the beach &amp; watching the sunset on the Gulf.  Saturday night we will 
go somewhere for FRESH seafood.  Sunday is the Tampa Bug Jam which 
is ALMOST as good as the Manassas shows.

If anyone is interested in participating in any of these events, 
send me a message and I will give further details in the next few 
days.
