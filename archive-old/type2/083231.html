Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts

I have some out of a Jetta (I think late '80s).  They have the
self-adjusting inertia reel.  They required a short strap-steel extension
to get them in the right position, but they are well worth the effort.
Being that they are inside their own covered inertial reel, they do not
receive the sun damage of normal belts, so they will probably be in good
shape.

&gt; Greetings all,
&gt;     I know this is a bit late, but I'll give it a shot. I am looking for
&gt; some seatbelts to use on the rear seat of my 70 Westy. I tried some out o=
f a
&gt; Beetle, but they are too short. If anyone has some and would like to sell
&gt; them, bring them to EBus. Pmail me with the cost and the other particular=
