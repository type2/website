&gt; &gt;Hi All. I have the chance to buy a 2l fi engine and 6 rib trans to replace

even more of a concern is that you want to put this in an auto tranny
bus.  there are significant differences between the buses, it can and has
been done, but it is not a bolt in fit..

the auto tranny body does not have anything for the clutch, the shift mech
is different. even the accelerator linkages are different.  also I believe
there are slight differences in the tranny mount.

&gt; &gt;need to know is how much drama it is going to be to make this combo fit with
&gt; &gt;the 6 rib trans? I remember seeing some where that a 3 or 5 rib trannies are
&gt; &gt;the only ones that will fit into this model. Why is this? is it something to
&gt; &gt;do with the trans to chassis mount? if so is it possible to fabricate an
&gt; &gt;adaptor? I am not worried about setting up a shifter or the FI etc at this
&gt; &gt;stage, just whether I can bolt this setup in.
&gt; &gt;I Have searched the archives and gone through the library drive train
&gt; &gt;section to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... that's interesting because I (and others) have posted this info 
&gt; many times before.
&gt; 
&gt; In a nutshell, the 6-rib trans (091) and bellhousing are 1&quot; longer than the 
&gt; 3 and 5 rib (002) transaxles.  1/2&quot; is in the bellhousing and 1/2&quot; is in 
&gt; the trans itself.  If you use the earlier bellhousing with the 091 trans, 
&gt; you can squeeze it into an earlier bus by utilizing (completely, I might 
&gt; add) the built-in flexibility of the engine and tranny mounts.  Just 
&gt; barely.  But you'll have to use your '74 flywheel, clutch and starter with 
&gt; the '74 bellhousing.  And the top of your gearshift will be a bit further 
&gt; back.  If you want to use all of the later parts, well... has anyone 
&gt; actually done that?  I don't see how it could work without serious 
&gt; modifications.
