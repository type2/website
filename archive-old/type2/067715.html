Subject: Re: Parts Plea for 75 Deluxe

&gt;Here are the parts I need:  The vent cover and city water inlet cover that
&gt;sit behind the driver's side door.  
&gt;
&gt;Also, what is WCM?  I think I have seen people talk about that on this
&gt; list,
&gt;is it a parts place?  
&gt;
&gt;thanks for any help..

Dave,

WCM is West Coast Metric, a somewhat expensive but high quality supplier of 
small body parts, window gaskets, and the like.  Their free catalog is 
fairly informative.  Their phone number is (800) 247-3202.

I have a pretty good supply of used 70's and 80's Westfalia parts.  I know 
I don't have a good city water cover, but I'm pretty sure I have a vent 
cover.  I'll get back to you on it in a day or so.
