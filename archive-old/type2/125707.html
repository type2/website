&gt; would be metered just the way it was explained--with a simple air
&gt; valve from a fish tank--
&gt; 
&gt; The specific volume at any given time is depending upon the amount of
&gt; vacuum the engine is making.
&gt; 
&gt; The water injection system is not sucking water / alcohol direct from
&gt; the bottom of the tank---
&gt; The draw hose is at the top of the tank--
&gt; The air intake side of the tank is the second hose which drops to the
&gt; bottom of the tank and the fluid--which the airstone, or clunk is
&gt; attached to.
&gt; 
&gt; Air is sucked in--the fluid is aerated, and the moisture is sucked out
&gt; of the tank at the top and into the engine--
&gt; 
&gt; How much is aerated is controlled by the air valve--the more open it
&gt; is--the more agitation of the fluid-which gets sucked up by a vacuum
&gt; hose to a T or an open vacuum port.
&gt; 
&gt; Pretty simple--and it does work.
