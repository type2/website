Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling - 1600Sp vs 1600DP


Hi Bob,
	I did this myself, and it worked out great.  The only thing I would add if 
I were you, is the type 3 cooling tin that fits between the cylinders and 
pushrod tubes.  On 105 degree day, driving uphill in first gear, with over 
1500 pounds of camping gear and human flesh, my cylinder head temp never 
exceeded 350 degrees!  My oil pressure was a healthy45 PSI as well(at 3K 
RPM).  Well worth the added effort.  Get the real VW ones though...

	Eron

&gt;I am thinking to upgrade my stock component 1600SP cooling system  to
&gt;1600DP sizings.
&gt;
&gt;I guess I need:
&gt;Doghouse (larger) oil cooler.
&gt;Tin (deeper) to house same.
&gt;Larger volume cooling fan.
&gt;
&gt;What else is needed, and what is the best plan of attack for getting the
&gt;conversion parts on the cheap side. - Vendors, parts yard sources, etc. ??
&gt;
&gt;Cooler, of course, I think should be bought as new.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Bob Perring
