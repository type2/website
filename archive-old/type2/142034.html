Subject: Subject: Headliner removal

Katherine,
            Haven't done a Type 2 headliner in years; but if they are anything 
like the Type 1... you first remove the windows, since the material is held by 
the window gasket; above the doors it is folded into a long clip (think of a 
very wide clothespin), welded into the body sheet metal.

Once you have the material loose, then look for the hoops -- these are made of 
spring steel wire running transversely under the roof.  You can 'release' these 
at their ends.

All very time-intensive... soak the window gaskets with warm dish detergent to 
help make them more pliable.... good luck!

Things are moving along with my project, but how in heck do I get the
headliner out????  I moved onto another job on the van before I ended up
making a mess out of the headliner.
