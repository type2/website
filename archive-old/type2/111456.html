&gt; Ahhhh, so I see.  Thank you. Anyone got a loaner bubble protractor? Heh!
&gt; Laura :o)

You don't really need one.  Just get a regular 50 cent plastic
protractor, drill a hole in the center point, run a knotted thread
through the hole, and tie a nut on the end of the thread.

To use, put the flat edge of the protractor against the bottom of the
spring plate, let the nut dangle by the thread, and take the reading where
the thread crosses the scale on the protractor.  The difference between
that reading and 90 is the spring plate angle.
