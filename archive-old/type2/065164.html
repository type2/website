&gt;Yes, it's most likely the relay. It's one of those silver cubes under the
&gt;fuse box. You have nothing to lose, so pry it open, experiment by applying
&gt;12 volts to the terminals and observe the mechanism at work. You'll see
&gt;how a small brass spring blade needs to be bent ever so slightly. Or
&gt;simply buy a new/used relay.

Since the big silver cube seems to be the turn signal relay eg. It click
when I do the turn signals... I will assume it is the smaller red plastic
cube... I will pull it apart and check it out... Thankx for the tip
