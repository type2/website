To digress a bit,  what are the advantages/disadvantages to this lack of #3
retard in a 1600 sp engine, for example?

Andy McKinley has the following to say IRT 009 vs. 05 (lifted from the Type
2 library):

&gt; The &quot;050&quot; has a smoother advance curve (flatter line on a graph of
&gt;rpm/degrees &gt;advance). The advance kicks in at around a hundred RPM lower
&gt;than the &quot;009,&quot; &gt;making it more suitable for use in a van. The &quot;050&quot; also
&gt;advances to a greater degree, &gt;around 26 degrees at ~3100 rpm, while the
&gt;&quot;009&quot; poops out at ~2650 RPM with a &gt;total advance of about 21 degrees.

I'm trying to make a decision on which way to go on dizz replacement in my 68
1600 sp.  It has a tired 009 in at now.

Thanks
