Yes, me again.

I installed REAR KYB gas adjust on the FRONT.  Guilty.  I should have 
checked the stock numbers.

This set up is tearing up the '78 Westy.

I will pull the front shocks off a '72, as an emergency R&amp;R.

Are these KYB gas adjust shocks any good??  I am super afraid to dump 
another $60 into real front shocks if what I am hearing and feeling is what 
I can expect with more KYB.

Oh, well, time to move cars and jack up cars and R&amp;R and R&amp;R and . ..
