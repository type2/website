&gt; Thats what I told him either that or a stripped drum or stub axle OR the
&gt; bolts have all come out of the cv and the nasty sound was the last one
&gt; shearing off.

Andy,

Absolutely correct, very valid possibilities.  Chris...  be sure to report
back!  Inquiring minds want to *know*!!!!  When I read your post, I was
hearing my own failing CV in my head and followed right along to the point
of failure.  Mine didn't, but it was mere miles away from failure when I
pulled it.  It might very well be bolts or a drum as well, tho I tend to
lean toward CV.  I have had bolts come loose and an axle nut come loose,
and neither changes tone quite the way a dying CV does.  My money is
on CV, but I sure would not mind if Andy was right and i was wrong.

&gt; I've found that a brass (That's BRASS, not steel!) hammer is very

(Tim... stop reading now!!!)

George,

I am a barbarian :-)  A brass hammer is the ideal tool for this job, you
are correct.  I don't own one :-(  I do own a fine selection of BFH's and
punches, tho :-)  If this were a Vanagon, I'd suggest a tow back and a
press.  For some reason, Vanagon CVs tend to be a metric bear (which is
2.2 times as bad as an American bear!!!) to get on and off, but bays need
a tap or two at most in my experience.

&gt; If you have a puller that holds the CV hub while pressing the axle,
&gt; that's dandy, but I never seem to be close to one when a CV needs to
&gt; come off! :)

Mine lives right under the back seat!  Of course, I regularly travel like
the white knight!  3/4&quot; drive socket set, 200+ 3/8&quot; and 1/2&quot; sockets, half
a dozen visegrips, 3 BFHs, a hydraulic jack, full tune up instruments,
etc. etc.  And that leaves out the crevices packed with parts :-) Just in
case I am ever called upon to field strip a bus in Taylor, Nebraska! :-)
