Subject: Re: Converting a 78 to a 74 type exhuast system

Ted,
I recently converted my 77 to a 74 exhaust. Besides the alternator bracket
you
will need 4 new pieces of lower tin and also the heat riser tubes from the
'74
boxes (my tubes came with my boxes).  The new altenator bracket attaches at
the lower side to a bolt on the rear outboard side of your heat box.  If it
is
a rusted blob like mine is you may want to try and get it removed prior to
installing the heat box.  I'm still looking for an altenator bracket myself,
I'll probably just fabricate one as all the ones that I've found in the
 wrecker yards are rusty POS.

 Good luck,
Drew

&gt; &gt; I've just purchased a complete 74 type exhaust system to use on my 78 2L
FI
&gt; &gt; engine.  I've been reading lately about the alternator bracket and that
it
&gt; &gt; is NLA.  Does anyone have a spare that I could purchase or can someone
tell
&gt; &gt; me how to make one?  Also, I was told when I purchased the parts that I
was
&gt; &gt; buying everything that I needed and I would like to confirm this.  I
&gt; &gt; purchased both heater boxes and the exhaust along with the gaskets.  Is
&gt; &gt; there anything else that I need?  I want to make sure that I have all of
my
&gt; &gt; ducks in a row before I remove the engine from the bus.  Also, does
anyone
&gt; &gt; have any insight that they could give me when attempting such a change?
