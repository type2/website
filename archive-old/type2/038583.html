I have 2 questions about my '71 camper that I cannot find an answer to.
Hope someone can help.
  1.  The front passenger seat tilts forward just enough to make it
uncomfortable (feels like you are going to slide out of it ).  I am talking
about the seat portion, not the back rest portion, of the seat.  Is there
some kind of rubber block or something that is suppose to be positioned
under the front part of the seat to raise it a little so it does not have
this forward tilt in it??
  2. What is the correct method for fastening the sliding door curtain to
the plastic hens-teeth slides that fit into the aluminum channel.  I read
something on here about 2 months ago that referred to the the hens-teeth
being connected to the curtain material via some kind of cording.  In the
curtain that I had, the circle part of the hens-teeth was attached  to the
curtain by just sewing thread thru the curtain material and then thru the
circle on the hens-teeth.  Is this the correct method?   Thanks in advance
to everyone for all of the wonderful advice we have received on here.
