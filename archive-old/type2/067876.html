&gt; Here comes some newbie stuff...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting ready to do my first tune-up on my Westy - had the first one
&gt; done by a professional when I first bought the thing, ready to do the
&gt; second one myself. So I open the engine compartment and get out the
&gt; Idiot Book, and start to look at the thing...
&gt; 
&gt; I was led by the PO to think that I had a 1600 DP in here. Seemed likely
&gt; - it's a '71 Westy. And the engine certainly looked just like the
&gt; Mexican replacement I had in my ol' '75 Super. Never had a problem with
&gt; that vehicle - first one was the original, and after my sister reduced
&gt; it to a lump of molten metal, the second one came with a set of
&gt; instructions from the folks I bought it from...
&gt; 
&gt; So I'm trying to figure out what the timing for the Westy should be, and
&gt; I check the engine number. Guess what? My engine's number is &quot;H&quot;. Just
&gt; H, nothing following. Muir gives &quot;H&quot; numbers for 1500 engines, circa
&gt; 1967... So what do I have here - a rebuilt case from a 1500? Is that why
&gt; the thing is working so danged hard? Man, I feel like an idjut, but why
&gt; the heck would you put a 1500 in a '71 bus?!

Just because it is marked *H* does not mean it is a 1500. It could have
been rebuilt to 1600 just by changing in jugs. The 1500 did not have the
cross member holes in them according to the books I have. How does your
engine mount at the rearend?

 
&gt; Question #2 is, of course - how should I time this thing? I'm going to
&gt; do it static; just can't figure out what the best timing for the thing
&gt; would be.


Static timing depends on the dist you have. Run no more than 28 - 30
TOTAL advance; set the static at what ever point you need to get that
total.

 
&gt; #3 - Whaddya think - should I replace the dist. with the 009 from my '64
&gt; wreck? The Westy has a Weber carb and a stock distributor.
&gt;
&gt; Sheesh. Nothing's easy. Good thing it started raining here and I can sit
&gt; and drink coffee and think about all this for a while... :)
