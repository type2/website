Subject: carb kit for Solex 30PICT-2:  some rookie questions

Greetings:

I got a tune-up kit for the Solex 30PICT-2 on my 1971 engine.
I've got the kit parts spread in front of me, along with the
instruction sheet, Muir, and Haynes [web link to Richard Kurtz's 
Hoover Sermon Page is temporarily down], and I'm running some 
mental simulations before I start on it tomorrow morning.  All 
credit to this list and the folks on it; six months ago I would 
have felt more confident taking out one of my own kidneys than 
monkeying around with a carb.  For those list members who could 
do this job in their sleep, and maybe even have done so, thanks
for bearing with me here.

I do have some questions for the type-2 brain trust:  For
starters, are there any typical rookie errors and omissions that
I should be especially watching out for?   [I've got the tools, a
good working space, and ample time, so at least I have the basics
on my side.]

Also, I'm having a little trouble identifying all the pieces
provided in the kit, which includes parts for the 28, the 30, and
the 34 models.  The provided instructions resolutely refuse to tell
you which parts go with which models, or to differentiate between
similar-looking parts Some things in the kit are no-brainers to 
place, some I've cyphered out from studying the diagrams, and some 
I'm sure I'll know what to do with when I get the thing open. There
are two questions I can't answer at this point:

First, the kit doesn't contain a float pin lug, although I was
expecting one, based on the [more helpful] instruction sheet sent
to me by Pat Walsh which flags those on the general exploded diagram
that it says are found in a tune-up kit.  Is this important? How can 
I tell if the lug I have in there now is okay?

Second, are there two O-rings I'll need to replace, or three?
The kit provides three, one about 15mm across and two about 5mm.
I figure the big one goes on the air bypass screw, and one of the
small ones on the volume control screw.  What about the other small 
one--does it have a place, or is it there just so that when I drop 
the first one and it rolls where I can't find it I'll have a spare?

The kit brand is one I'd never heard of--Hygrade, &quot;a division of
Standard Motor Products, Inc.&quot;--but I wrote that off to my own
rookie-dom at first.  [The only association I had for the brand
name Hygrade was a meat packing plant once located in Indianapolis, 
somewhere near where the city zoo is now; best not to dwell on that 
one.]  Now as I try to reconcile the parts provided, the parts 
listed, and the instructions, I'm beginning to wonder:  Should I 
be more wary about relying on this kit?  Or should I just relax 
and do it?

Thanks in advance for any advice [I get the list in digest mode].
