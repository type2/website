Subject: Re: Battery Pan rust

&gt;Perhaps there's a reason, but why don't VW owners just add a rubber
&gt;battery tray?

I'm going to do this right now!  Can I get one of these at KMart or Ace or
something?  I'm in a small town and even though my battery pan is pretty
rusty, I'd just like to have it so I don't worry about my battery falling
through!
