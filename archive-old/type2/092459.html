Subject: Re: [T2] Stinger on a type 4 engined bus?

I have seen it done with t4s put into bugs,  but the question is...did 
yours have a cat on the exhaust. dont remember what year cat converters 
were put on.  This may make it difficult to do in a lot of states.

&gt; Anyone ever attempt to rig a Baja stinger to a type 4 exhaust, did you
