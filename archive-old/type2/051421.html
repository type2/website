&gt; &gt;&gt; one remaining hurdle though, and that is a big bad battery drain. something
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the charging system is foul. overnight the battery dies. been through
&gt; &gt;&gt; the dash looking, but everything there seems perfect according to bentley's
&gt; &gt;&gt; wiring diagram. red gen light is on only while driving - at all revs.
&gt; &gt;&gt; question: what is the life span of a regulator? local repairman - not a
&gt; &gt;&gt; guru - suggested they go in about 10 years. i'm up in the air, and look to
&gt; &gt;&gt; your advise.  - steve
&gt; &gt;Steve are you sure it's a battery drain or a non  charging generator?
&gt; &gt;I've found that the regulator has been replaced with a bug one instead
&gt; &gt;of a 38 amp bus one and that shortened its life.
&gt; &gt;Another culprit is the generator brushes. Since generators use
&gt; &gt;commutators instead of slip ring like alternators, brushes do not last
&gt; &gt;as long. I've never had a long running type 1 motor, but I'd guess in
&gt; &gt;the 30k to 50k mile range is the life of generator brushes.

&gt; 
&gt; you mean even though the brushes look good, they may be shoddy?
&gt; and this: its a bit of a frankenstein in the engine compartment...the
&gt; engine case is typeIII (not problematic - just an indication of change);
&gt; and with that there is a different generator not listed in catalogs or
&gt; bentley as being stock type2. my generator number is:
&gt; 101 302 083
&gt; 14V38A 19
&gt; which leads me to think its 38 amps, but perhaps the owner never changed
&gt; the regulator to match. problematic?
&gt; 
&gt; not sure how to determine whether it is not charging or draining  - steve '68

Steve: 
In brushes, size matters. Length at least. Also important that the
springs are okay.
The generator should be a 211 number, but the 38 amps is good, so I'd
not be too concerned about it not being the right part. I'd take out the
regulator and take off the cover. Sometimes you don't have to know too
much about it to tell that it's shot. That was my case anyway. The
Bentley does have all the specs and how to set the contacts in the
regulator, but mine were just fried!
