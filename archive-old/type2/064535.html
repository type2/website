Subject: Engine Dies  (was: air-conditioning for a '71)

&gt; From: &quot;Steven Johnson&quot; &lt;sjohnson_at_PCOCD2.INTEL.COM&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So Vw says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This summer we had our engine die at the beginning of a long trip,
&gt; &gt; about 90 miles south of Las Vegas. We were headed to South Dakota in
&gt; &gt; our dark blue '71 bus.  Maybe the new speed limit contributed to the
&gt; &gt; demise of the engine, because the guy that rebuilt it said that it
&gt; &gt; got too hot and pretty much voided the warranty, even though it was
&gt; &gt; only a couple of months since the rebuild.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, AAA towed us to Las Vegas, and we rented a Ford Club Wagon
&gt; &gt; for the next week. The Club Wagon was nice, went the 75 mph speed
&gt; &gt; limit through Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska without any
&gt; &gt; trouble, and had AIR CONDITIONING, a nice thing to have in August.
&gt; &gt; But it got less than 15 mpg.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, now that we have been really spoiled, and since a new club wagon
&gt; &gt; costs nearly $30,000.00, what can we do to make the VW bus more
&gt; &gt; comfortable?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried adding air conditioning to a bread loaf?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'm suprised there have not been more postings on this.  Maybe
&gt; because it's kind of an FAQ.  I would think that you'd first want
&gt; to know what the cause was of the over heating of your engine.  I
&gt; suspect as with most rebuilds, it was probably the valve getting
&gt; out of adjustment.  I've heard this story over and over many times.
&gt; You must check the valves after very short miles after a rebuild.
&gt; I even recommend to check them after 50 miles of driving.  I've 
&gt; found that I could not slide the feeler gauge through several valves
&gt; after 100 miles after a rebuild on a friends '68 bus.  You've
&gt; really got to watch them.  

VW replies:

We are not VW novices. In fact I had checked the valve clearances and
changed the oil (which I do at 3000 mile intervals AND within a
couple of days of a new rebuild). In fact, this particular engine was
preety good at keeping the valve clearances steady. After the engine
started smoking on a big hill south of Las Vegas, we stoppped
immediately, even though the engine was still running. After it
cooled overnight, I checked the valves, which were all fine, but the
compression in #3 was zilch, and that's where the oil was leaking from
as well. The oil was not burning in the engine, but on the outside of
the hot jugs.   

The rebuilder, Pro-Tech in Riverside, checked everything he could
think of, including timing, tin, oil cooler (which was not leaking),
carburation, etc., and he could not explain why it overheated, if,
indeed that's what actually happened. My engine head temperture
sensor was in its normal range when the incident occurred.

&gt; 
&gt; Other possible causes for overheating are:
&gt; 
&gt;            insufficient engine seals
&gt;            time/dwell not adjusted correctly
&gt;            air/fuel mixture too lean
&gt;            fan belt too loose
&gt;            Missing engine tin
&gt;            Cooling fan/shroud obstructed
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure that all of the above conditions are fixed if they exist.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you've got the engine cooling system completely in order, then
&gt; you might consider an AC system.  Many VW people won't even consider
&gt; an AC system in an air-cooled VW.  I believe you can use one, but you
&gt; have to be judicious about how you use it.  For instance, when climbing
&gt; any uphill grade, I would turn it off so as not to over-tax the engine.
&gt; You're depending on a small 1600 engine to push a great big box and
&gt; that is enough of a load already.  When you're on the flat or downhill,
&gt; turn it back on again.  Don't drive when it's over 110 out.  That is
&gt; just too hot for an air-cooled VW.  Drive in the morning or evenings and
&gt; your engine will be happy.  

Again, we were going uphill and it was hot outside, about 105 degrees
Fahrenheit. But we've climbed that hill in the bus lots of times.


&gt; 
&gt; There is a company in your area called International Conditioning Enter-
&gt; prises that specializes in airconditioning for bugs/buses and squarebacks.
&gt; Here's their address:
&gt; 
&gt;               International Conditioning Enterprises (I.C.E.)
&gt;               3295 Market St.
&gt;               San Diego, CA 92102
&gt;         Phone:(800)845-0424
&gt; 
&gt; They are pricey from what I've heard.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck!

Thanks for your thoughts on air conditioning.
