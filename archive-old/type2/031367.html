&gt; &gt;The '72-'79 trans will not fall to the ground when you remove the engine.

although I have a chain with two hooks on it the right length that I

but that is just my paranoia

&gt; bolts holding the carrier in place.  Funny that, Sean and I have had the
&gt; discussion, if you know busses and see that bolt laying about, you know
&gt; instantly what it is, nothing else quite like it.

that is for sure, I had been working on the engine tranny and noticed one
of em in the rubble on the shop floor and immediately went under the bus
realizing one had not been put back in
&gt; 
&gt; A trivial addition is of course the Vanagon 091 has no rear carrier and will
&gt; indeed drop, a glorious design as it allows you to easily pull the trans and
&gt; engine as a unit taking out only 8 bolts (OK not counting the CV's but they
&gt; go quick with an air ratchet) or to leave it in place and pivot the tranny
&gt; to make alignment a snap compared to the evil '72-'79 design.  For either

HOWEVER since with an auto tranny you do not have to clear the long tranny
shaft and clutch presure plate it makes for a much simpler engine removal
since it is almost a straight drop.  IMO, especially since I use a tranny
jack under the engine.
