Subject: [T2] BN4 Heater Cut Templates

 I now have a copy of the installation brochure and the templates to cut the
holes for the BN4 gas heater  in my 1978 Bus. THANKS CASPAR!  I would be
willing to make copies for US residents if the demand isn't too great. It
seems that a lot of people who have these heaters have one or two that
they've used for parts. Please consider selling the needed items:

1) duct work that attaches to the wheel well and under the back seat.
2) control switch
3) control cable
4) return air duct work (just top piece and vent grill)

If you have some of these parts but don't recognize them by my description,
I could send you a copy of the drawing/schematics and highlight the part.

Thanks a lot.
