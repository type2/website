Subject: Re: [T2] Chipping?

&quot;Chipping&quot; an engine is routinely done by guys that won't/can't get their
hands dirty, or can't perform REAL upgrades themselves. You'll routinely
here the Rice Crowd throw terms around like &quot;chipping&quot;, &quot;NAAAWWWS&quot;, etc, and
most of them have no clue how an engine really works anyways, so it's good
for a laugh as they try to impress their friends.

&quot;Chipping&quot; an engine is either installing a new ECU, or re-programming the
existing one, to achieve different engine controls (boost, timing, injector
times, etc), and it's almost always done to improve performance. The only
Flat-4 VW engines you can do this to are the late model vanagons.

It's also worth noting that in many cases &quot;chipping&quot; a car does absolutely
ZERO to increase an engine's peformance. It's easy to put something in a box
with fancy marketing and advertising, most of the guys buying them would
never know if the thing was faster or not. Of course if they pay $200 for a
&quot;chip&quot; they'll swear it is now faster then before, even if the chip
changeover was never even performed by a mechanic.
