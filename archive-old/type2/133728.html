Subject: RE: [T2] Weber carb Vac line placement....

&gt;From: John Baker


&gt;Ok, when running a weber carb with a dual vac dizzy on
&gt;a T4 engine, where do the vac lines go?? There is a
&gt;big port (like 1/4&quot; at the base of the center of the
&gt;intake manifold, I assume this one is for the brake
&gt;booster)

Yes that should go to the brake booster.

&gt;but there is also a small port on the rear of
&gt;the carb (rear is rear) and there is another small
&gt;port on the right (passenger) side of the carb. So
&gt;which is advance, which is retard, etc. etc.
&gt;Also, I'm not sure about the dizzy on this engine.
&gt;Should there even be a DUAL vac dizzy on a 1700 engine?

If that is the same carb from me. I never had the other Vacuum lines 
connected because it had a .009 installed.  But take a look here especially 
at the bottom of the pages.

Hope this helps.
