Hi Gregory,

And to think that a well-placed pair of vise grips (on the furl hose, with 
the sharp jaws blunted by tape or small pieces of wood) would have prevented 
such a humorous write-up!  Thanks for helping us remember what it's like to 
be a newbie, and good luck with future Bus repair adventures.

Best,
Jason Z Upper
