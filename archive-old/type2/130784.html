Subject: Re: [T2] More foam seals - engine compartment

Hi Chris,

Forget the hardware aisle and head over to &quot;Sports&quot;. I was thinking 
about trying a poly-urethane foam &quot;Swim noodle&quot; in this application. 
Buy a 3&quot; diameter noodle and slit it lengthwise almost to the centre on 
both sides.

They're waterproof, but I have no idea how they'll hold up to high heat 
applications. Strangely enough, the manufacture does not list this 
quality in the specs. You got to admit they're a lot more colorful than 
the stock part.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Don't mind ordering the right one from one of the online vendors but I 
&gt; need one &quot;right now&quot;...
