Subject: RE: Stike vwoa

Hi all,
  two summers ago I made a trip out to our local VW
dealership.  If anyone here knows of the Toledo Ohio
area, you will know that there is only one VW dealer
left in town.  Well I made a trip out to Perrysburg
where it is located and the only guy that saw me was
the one at the gate... Driving up in my 1970 Westy.
  I parked next to some new beetles and got out and
walked the long way around so it looked like I had
parked somewhere else.  I was not there too long
before a salesman came up to me to toss out his
line.... When he asked, I replied &quot;I want one of
those&quot; and pointed at my green westy.  Dude about laid
an egg trying to say that they didn't get many of
those in and he could look for one.  After a while of
him hemming and hawing... I fessed up that it was my
bus and I wanted to look around at the VW's and see if
there was anything nice around.  I even offered that
he could take my bus out for a test drive, but he
declined and gave a nice excuse.  
  That was the most fun I could have in one afternoon
looking at cars.  Then I took off to the Army Surplus
store down the street and bought some cool stuff for
my bus.  
  Wavin from Michigan, still chuckling over the
salesman's stammer.
