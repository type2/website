&gt; How long ago?
&gt; How old were the tires?

It was a while back, but the tires in question weren't aged or worn out.
The first was a French &quot;X&quot; in 235R15 on a lightly-loaded Chevy van, which
belonged to my father who knew not to swap sides.  It stripped
its tread and beat the living daylights out of the body and wheelwell
before i could get stopped.  The second was (IIRC) a nearly new Canadian
XZX in 215R14.  I had installed it new only six months before on a
utility trailer.  It peeled the tread off in only a few revolutions, but
this still did bad things to the fenders.  the trailer was left on the
fully-inflated carcass.  This tire had, at most, 2000 miles on it and had
never been loaded to even 50% of its capacity.

&gt; Old Michelins did this when you reversed direction of the tire.
&gt; The belts 'set' in one direction, then let loose when you swapped them side to
&gt; side. This is the reason you always rotated them front to back, never in the X
&gt; like you did with bias ply tires.
&gt; Supposedly Michelin has corrected this problem.
&gt; I have had Michelin XZX reinforced tires shed the tread. But I have never seen
&gt; the replacement MX do it.

I've run all sorts of tires, from top-of-the-line Contis and Michelin to
cheapo Nankangs and East German Pneumants.  The only tires that have
experienced a vehicle-damaging failure were the Michelins.  They may say
that they have corrected the problem, but Michelin has already &quot;fooled me
twice&quot; so I avoid them.
