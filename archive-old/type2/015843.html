&gt;&gt;For me, 50hp is not enough.
&gt;&gt;David Schwarze              '73 VW Safare Custom Camper &quot;Bluto&quot; (56 RWHP)
&gt;
&gt;Is this really so much different from my 1600DP?

Won't know until you put it on the dyno.  :)  But know that rear wheel
horsepower is not the same as the horsepower numbers that VW throws around.
 Rear wheel horsepower is reduced by drivetrain losses, which are generally
thought to be on the order of 15% (I believe it's somewhat lower than that,
but that's a whole 'nuther can of worms).

The 56 horsepower I got was from a 55,000 mile engine with very low
compression (7.0), crappy GEX heads and under-jetted (lean) carbs.  I did
it for a baseline, and in a couple of months when the engine has been
refreshed, I will do it again and I'm expecting a 10hp increase.

&gt;The only bus that I have ever driven that had an appreciable difference in
&gt;performance was a '78 2.0 f/i.  Not even the 1.8 had enough of a power
&gt;increase for me to notice it, so I really don't see the big improvement.

But you did see the improvement in the 2 liter FI, right?  Maybe that's
when VW finally &quot;got it right&quot;.  You're correct that the 1700/1800's don't
have a whole lot more power than the 1600, but it's a little more power
(which is welcome) and you get all of the other benefits of the type IV,
which you may or may not care about, and of course you get a few negatives
too, which you learn to live with.

&gt;Apparently neither did VW, because they saw fit to install the 1600 up
&gt;into the Vanagon years.

In Europe, where they tax your car by the size of the engine.

&gt;I don't think I'll get rid of my bus just to be rid of a gland nut and
&gt;add 6 hp.

When you compare apples to apples, you will get more than 6 hp, and besides
the gland nut, you get an aluminum case, bigger/stronger bearings, rods,
and crankshaft, bigger clutch, better pushrod tubes, factory alternator,
etc..  I don't want to turn this into a full-blown religious argument, and
I certainly wouldn't try and talk you or anyone else into getting rid of
your bus just to get a type IV engine.  It's just a matter of choice, and I
choose the type IV.  :)
