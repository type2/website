While this list is on a discussion about the merits
of 72 VW vans. I'd like to send a general question out
to list members to aid my aquisition for the &quot; best bus&quot;
Question: If list members could chose one bus bet 1969
and 1979,  for long term longevity, parts availabilty,
repair ease, driveability......I am not referring to
specialtly units,,such as double cab p/u  or such..
just the run of the mill bus..whether it be camper/passenger 
bus...not so concerned with interior refinements..

I want to purchase one model year of van and try to obtain 
as many spare parts/spare vehicles as I can for that
particular year, in order to drive it for next 40 yrs.

Now I realise I am opening a real can of worms here...and
for every 10 listees  there will be 10 different answers.
and thats fine.. not trying to start any in fighting here.

But rather than post to me directly...send to list in general..
I think the info would be very informative  for all to
read....

Well...what's the consensus????

Glen Schattner  74 &amp; 78 passenger bus  ( so far)...
