Subject: Re: [T2] 1 of 2 dual carbs whining at me bad

I would take a good long hard look at if its all tightened down 
properly, make sure that all the electrical connections are  properly 
connected, I cut through a lose wire once and I was backfiring all over 
the place.

Also, have you adjusted/balanced them ? I would check two things, 
either that you are getting enough fuel or getting too much air (leak).

My 34's have acted up twice, once when poorly adjusted and when one of 
my wires was disconnected.

Check all those bolts and connections, then check the adjustements.

Just my thoughts.
Steve
