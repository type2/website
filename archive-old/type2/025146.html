Subject: [T2] fuel thingy?


hi list,

after purchasing a way too short fuel filler hose on
aircooled_dot_net, i discovered that the cause of my fuel
leak problem was not the filler hose but the first
short fuel elbow thingy that connects to the mouth of
the gas cap. it has an 90 degree bend facing
downward.it's the part labeled 1 on my volkswagen fuel
system illustration. can anybody tell what the exact
name of this is so i can start my internet search? or
if anyone knows where i can purchase one of these
thingys or has a spare one lying around that would be
super.  



have a great day,

tesa
