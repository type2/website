Subject: changed gear oil

I changed the transmission oil today after my 17mm drain plug socket
arrived.  I had a hard time find a level spot in the parking lot to fill it
up.  It sure froths up after you drive it even a little bit.

The magnetic drain plug had a unexpectedly large ball of filings on it.
Pretty sharp stuff.  I was surprised to see this much: about a cm sized ball
at the end.

The old gear oil had a vague shift feel but it was smooth.  What color is
the original oil supposed to be when it wears out?

Anyway, the shifting is a lot firmer now; a solid feel although a bit more
effort is required to get it into gear: &quot;notchy&quot; but smooth, no noise of
grinding.  Is this common?
