Subject: [T2] dual battery relay

Hi all,

     The 76 westy I am selling has a dual battery system in it.  I do not
think the aux. battery is charging.  It is down to 10 volts.  The PO had a
Ford 3-post relay in it &amp; when I got it, I hooked it up to the coil.
Everything was fine until now.  If the relay is bad, what is the proper one
to use?  Thanks.
