Yup, number of one year only parts to a 68.Can't remember which ones this
late. What you have is a dealer promo, could be bought from the parts
department at one time. Pretty nice, not worth a fortune, but not cheap
either.

&gt; Just a trivial question here( maybe a couple)
&gt; Were there one year only parts in the 68?
&gt; Reason I ask is I remember a guy lookin' for a front beam at a used parts
&gt; place I used to work at and he wouldn't take the 68 beam because he said
it
&gt; wouldn't fit his 69. We all looked at each other, eyebrows up,
&gt; and found him a 69.
&gt; Also I have a toy ( it is friday right?) from a VW dealer given to me by
my
&gt; aunt (80 year old VW person)
&gt; telling me she got it when she bought their old bus in the early 70s.
&gt; It is a green baywindow, 69ish but on the bottom , along with VW insignia
it
&gt; is dated 67.
&gt; Anybody seen these, is it the model of the bay prototype, worth a fortune?

&gt; &gt; Hi guys!  I thought you'd like to see some before and after pictures of
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; 1968 Bus.  I'll be posting more pictures of the rust repair as I get the
&gt; &gt; lastest interior shots.
