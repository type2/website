I am currently having quite a bit of trouble with Mark Stephens motors. They
have a good rep for building a quality engine but if you are in the small
percentile that has trouble you are on your own.
I recomend that you find a local shop and spec the engine to your needs, that
way there can be no long distance finger pointing.
