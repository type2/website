&gt;All VOM's of any quality at all come with complete instructions to make 
&gt;basic tests. Some very few current digitals might not have a dwell setting, 
&gt;but most do. They measure time and display the on/off ratio as a percentage 
&gt;of 1. A chart or simple math will give you the dwell for various numbers of 
&gt;cylinders. Most meters designed for automotive use will let you set the 
&gt;number of cylinders and do the math internally and readout direct dwell.

Before I bought my $15 Sunpro (&quot;accept no other substitutes!&quot; or &quot;as seen in the Steve Dolan butt-crack photo&quot;) I was researching other automotive multi-meters and re: Fluke I found out that the 78 does dwell but the newer 88 only does duty cycle.   Instead they provide a table in the printed manual to help you convert to dwell.  Annoying considering the price you are paying.

Anyway, to the original poster, in the archives you can find posts about &quot;poor mans' dwell&quot; like this one:
