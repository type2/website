Subject: 54 Deluxe Prices

A friend of mine has a 54 Deluxe that is very complete and has been in a
garage since 1965. It doesn't have the original engine. The only rust is
located  in the left and right floor area in the front and there is a 6&quot;
x 10&quot; hole in the cargo/pasenger area. The headliner is sort of nasty
and has a tear. The interior panels are there but beat up. He has
expresed some interest in selling it but has not mentioned a price. He
has assured me that I'm first in line so I want to be prepared to buy it
if he decides to sell it. You don't see these for sale to often so I
don't know how much scrounging and scraping for cash I'l need to do. I
might have to sell the V*n*g*n which I don't really want to do. Any info
would be appreciated.

Justin
