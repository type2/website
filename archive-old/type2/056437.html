Hi Volks,

the pictures that Philip Parker made of the '98 Devon Camper are 
online now.  They're to be found at or Web site at
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~t2ig/archiv/brazil.html
together with a Web page on the &quot;Kombi Carat&quot; deluxe bus I robbed 
from Transvemasa's now-extinct Web site.  Check it out, and if any of 
you have any more information on the topic, additional pics, or can 
translate the Portugese, please keep all material coming!

Thanks, and may the wind be with you!
    Erik.
