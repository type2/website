Subject: ba6 heater

Heres my question for the all knowing list. I have a chance to pick up a BA6
heater. I understand that this is a really good heater to have for a bus. My
question is just how involved is installing one of these badboys into a
bus(74) ? Im not exactally a professional mechanic or anything, but I can
turn a wrench,weld if I had a welder, remove and replace a part if need be.
So anyone out there in Oklahoma who could maybe help me? Electrical wise I'm
pretty much in the dark but I'm a fast learner.
