Subject: ghost engine knock

Hi Jan,
It sounds like you may have sucked a foreign object into the combustion
chamber.  Sometimes, if you're lucky, the engine will just spit the object
out without hurting anything.  Sometimes a chunk of carbon becomes dislodged
from inside the chamber and temporarily wedges in the wrong place and causes
a similar condition.  Another possibility is that you dropped a valve which
knocked for a while then realigned into a position that wasn't hitting
anything.  If this is the case then you would have no compression on that
cylinder, and a dead miss as a symptom.
Hope this helps.
