&gt;I noticed that the VDO oil pressure gauge is acting weird.  The 
&gt;whole trip it was at about 22 and stayed there. Now it is acting 
&gt;like a tachometer.  It goes up to about 30 in first then I shift to 
&gt;second and it drops down to about 20 and raises up again until 
&gt;I sift into third.  Then it stays at about 24.  

It's supposed to do that.  Your oil pressure varies with engine speed.
Lower engine speed = lower oil pressure and higher engine speed = higher oil
pressure.

All in all, your pressure seems a little low to me, but it may just be due
to a high-mileage engine.  What weight oil are you using?  On my fresh 2.0,
running 10W-40 oil, at crusing speeds (over 3000 RPM) I run about 35 PSI
when I'm fully warmed up (like after 45 minutes on the highway).  Around
town, I see fluctuations anywhere from 20 up to 65 PSI depending on
operating temperature and engine speed.
