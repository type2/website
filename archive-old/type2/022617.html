Subject: Last Call: Free '70 Camper to good home

------_=_NextPart_001_01C14303.94655E9E

I have a 1970 Camper in my driveway in Bowie, MD that I'd like to give to
anyone who might want a project or parts.

It's got:
*	radial wheels and spare (it's been on jacks, wheels off the ground)
*	isolator for 2 battery set up
*	full length bench seat (no hanging locker) that pulls out into bed
*	pop top with good canvas, netting and cot
*	table, single seat behind driver, and icebox with electric water
pump at sink
*	mechanical advance distributor

It ran fine about 10 years ago when I garaged it until last year.

The body's somewhat rusted but probably salvagable.

Lots of good parts and the camper components are in good shape.  It's
metallic green with serape curtains.

Couple of doors are sticky but sliding door is fine; rear window is rusted
at bottom; inside panels probably ought to be replaced, and there's no glass
in the passenger window.

I'm sad to be parting with her, but I'm moving and just can't take her with
me on this one.  Would like to find someone who might put her to good use.

Interested parties can call me on 301-706-9013.  New house owners move in on
the 27th, so she's going to have to go in the next week.

She'll need a trailer or a flatbed truck.  Rear wheel brake pads are stuck
to drums.  It'll roll, but it's a chore.

Best,
Howard
