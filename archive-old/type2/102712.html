Subject: FIXED - '79 CA bus dead at the side of the road.

My bus in now back on the road with new heads and cam.

Recap
Bus died at the side of the freeway 3 miles from my house. Less than 10K
miles on rebuilt
Found no compression on #3 and #4, so had it towed to my local VW shop.
Engine tear down revealed dropped valve seats. Heads were rebuilt + new
rings.
Heads were reinstalled but the engine would not turn by hand.
Opened bottom end, found teeth sheared off of the cam gear.

Can anyone shed some light on the root cause of this failure????

About 70 degrees worth of the cam gear are completely gone.
There is abnormal wear of the gear teeth. A handful look like new the rest
of the teeth
look wedge shaped, many with a knife edge to them.
