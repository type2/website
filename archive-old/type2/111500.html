&gt; Anyway, I wanted to plan a camping trip in the keys this winter (about a 3
&gt; hour trip from Fort Lauderdale). BUT.. as it would turn out.. she says she
&gt; hates camping (she's never gone). She says that she refuses to sleep in the
&gt; Bus and she only wants to use it to take to the beach.

For my birthday last year I talked the wife into camping w/ me at
Everybus. She was very reluctant, but did it anyway. She had such a
good time, we made it to HCBF and several this year. One good
experience is the best motivator. I would suggest finding a camping
event and then it's much better with people. Plus seeing all the other
people &quot;crazy&quot; enough to do this helps.
