Subject: RE: [T2] Don's Road Trip Update 3

Nope, that's a different bus Mark.  In the last year or so I purchased
another bus that was the same year, color, engine and everything.  This
second one is the one I sold to Don...after I did a top end rebuild on it.

My son was born in the first bus.  I'll never get rid of it.
