Subject: oil temp sender

Mr. Atwell was kind enough to send me a link showing exactly where to drill the 9/16&quot; hole in the sump plate on an 1800 bus engine. Worked marvelously however I DO NOT have a M14x1.5 nut to attach the sender to the plate. I have tried my local hardware store and a specialty fastener center, to no avail, except for a thick, honkin' nut that will probably not clear the engine case. Anyone with experience care to tell me how yoy worked around this problem? Thanks!
