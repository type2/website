X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

&gt;I plugged it in the other day in the garage in 30 Deg C shade
and was suprised at how cool it felt when I stuck my hand (and head:) in ! I
plan on running it throu the cig liter plug while driving and running it off
ground power at night while camping. This will be off the main starting
battery. Anyone have any comments on how this'll work or similar experience
with Koolatron coolers.

Hi Phil, I have a 40 quart Igloo Koolmate, which is similar, I think.  It is
cooled by a peltier chip, which is a solid state thermoelectric device, for
those unfamiliar with these things, that moves heat from one side to
another.  They're often found under the main processor in a computer, but
somebody figured out that you can use them to cool a refrigerator.

Anyway, I love the thing.  I bought it 6 months ago for about $60 off ebay,
and had doubts about it, but I thought I'd take a flyer.  Much to my delight
the thing works, and works well.  I run it off my solar panels, and unless
I'm doing some entertaining, I keep my kitchen fridge shut off.  It draws
about 5 amps, so it would not be suitable for running continuously off a
starting battery.

It will also not keep things ice cold when the temp is over 100 degrees, and
it is better at keeping things cold than at cooling them.  I think you could
help it out with bags of ice for faster cooling as long as the ice stayed in
the bags and you didn't use it as a regular ice chest.

Regards,

Grant
