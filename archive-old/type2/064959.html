  If it is an choice of only one and you have a stock engine, my feeling is
  keep the stock dist. and go with the CD ignition.

  I have both a Jacobs BugPak ignition system and a 009 on my 1776cc engine
  with dual carbs.  If I still had the stock engine and carb I'd have kept
  the stock dist.  Had to go with the 009 on this engine.  The ignition
  system made a noticable difference in better idle, smooth running and
  power (seat of pants gauge &lt;g&gt;).

Hi,

Would someone be kind enough to give me their humble opinion
as to whether it would be better to upgrade the ignition on
my 1600cc twin port by fitting a CD ignition system or a
Bosch 009 system ( Assuming you know what a Bosch 009 is!;-)


Ta!
