&gt; Why not a bolt and nut so that they are easy to cut off and replace?

Probably to make initial assembly easier.  Having the nuts captive
probably saved a few seconds for the assembler installing the muffler.

&gt; I will prob have to drill them out all egg shaped now and try to 
&gt; squeeze the nuts in behind them. I have such a nice muffler
&gt; and such a bad tailpipe.

It's pretty hard to keep any high-temperature nuts from corroding.  You
might try stainless steel fasteners.  I have had reasonably good luck
with permatex anti-sieze applied liberally upon assembly.

&gt; PS: I could also rant about 'quickie oil change' places that
&gt; put 5 quarts of oil into the type4 motor causing me to 
&gt; think that I blew out the rear seal. I drained a quart and it
&gt; is happy again. Now all I have to do is wait 6 months for the
&gt; stank to get out of the heater system.

The real problem here is in going to the quickie oil-change place in
the first place.  If they don't overfill/underfill/fill with the wrong
stuff, they'll leave the drain plug loose or else strip the threads!

You don't really save any time with these places anyway, so why not do
it yourself?
