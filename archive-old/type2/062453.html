Subject: My First Trip Report

As many of you read a couple of weeks ago I recently became the owner of a 1979 Bus.  And not in the traditional way.  No money was exchanged between the owner and myself, only comitiments.  In my own terms she is my miracle bus, one that will on January 9, 1997 offer me the opportunity to do something I have always dreamed of doing, take a trip around the US and it's borders.

Well, this weekend I decided I would take my first adventure in &quot;The Mothership&quot; as she is so appropriately named.  I didnt know where I wanted to go, but I knew I wanted adventure.  And that I got.

On Wednesday nite of last week I sat and thought about my direction, finally I came to the conclusion that there must be a bluegrass festival happening somewhere close, especially since I live in North Georgia.  Since I hadn't been to such a festival since I was in college (20 years ago), I felt this would be a good way to not only check out and bond with my bus, but also fill then need for great music, which has always been a love of mine.  

I went on the net and did as search on &quot;bluegrass&quot; and found that there was one happening in Rome Georgia, about 100 miles away.  It was the &quot;ARMUCHEE BLUEGRASS FESTIVAL&quot;, probably one of the better festivals in the southern Appalachains region, and I had curiosity about the Armuchee name.  So on Thursday I struck out with &quot;The MS&quot; loaded with gear for camping, and eating and sleeping while camping.  

I couldn't wait, my first adventure in the long dreamed of miracle bus.  Since she came with custom camping interior, I felt that I should sleep in her womb as much as possible.  That I did, and very well I might add.

The festival turned out to be very satisfying on the music side, and less satisfying with respect to some of the people.  All in attendance were white, (not that I don't enjoy my own race, but I also like some diversity) and many of them were racists and bigots, and there were some there that were just &quot;not very brite&quot;.  But since I didn't come to analyze people, and did come to hear music, I turned my attentions away from the personalities and to the true art that was presently being served.  As any good American would do on vacation.

Upon my arrival at the fest, the first thing I see is a 1979 VW bus, same color, but not as pretty as &quot;Mother&quot; sitting in the campground.  So like any person of proper VW persuasion would do, I pull in beside her.  I found that her owner was something of a &quot;dull dude&quot;, but the Bus was in good shape, he really hadn't done anything with her.  Hell, he hadn't even named her and he had owned her since 1979.  I just felt that this was an &quot;abomination in the sight of God&quot; as my grandmother used to say, and told him he should give her a name.  He agreed, but said his son was going to be the next owner and that he could name her.

After talking with him and him giving me some pointers on VW care, which I badly needed to hear, and appreciated hearing it, I walked over to where the &quot;scattered campground music festival guitar pluck&quot; was happening.  Man, what a show.  One hasn't experienced the true southerness of bluegrass players until they have sat in on a guitar pluck jam session.  These guys and gals play like they need to draw sweat.  of course they all sing with a whiny nazal tone, and you can't understand much that they say, but damn, they are musicians of the highest order.

I met, played, and sung with some of the greats like Jerry Hall, Huey Wiler, and Ed something another from somewhere I didn't know where it was.  They were drinkin, pickin', grinnin', and singin'.  I hadn't been around people that happy in quite a while.

I stayed Thursday and Friday nites, then left to go and spend one nite in the East Tennessee Mountains.  For years I have been going to a place called Holly Flats that lays on the border of Tenn. and NC.  It is an old CCC Camground that is seven miles up a mountain road that comes complete with good gravel road, fairly steep inclines, downhills, and sharp switchbacks. 

I left the CG at 8:00 am Saturday morning.  I was just a couple a miles away when I came upon a terrible accident.  Four teenagers coming home from an all night church party, had spun off the road, ran into a ditch, and hit a culvert.  The car flipped up-side down while in the air, landing on its top and sliding down the highway about 75 feet before coming to a rest..  It had happened about two minutes before I arrived.  

There was a guy trying to drag them out of the car, so I joined in the efforts.  I got out my first aid kit and started doing what I could, for who I could, as quickly as I could.  The car caught a little fire, we got that out and went back to ending to the injuries.  The ambulances came and the parmedics took over.  They were busted up pretty bad, but it appeared they would all survive.  They were in good human hands, plus it happened right in front of a church, and God is always home, so I went on my way.  Prayerfully, I might add.

At first I was a bit concerned whether I should test her with the mountain terrain.  In other words, I wanted to pamper her, but she had gone through the highway check with flying colors, cruising at 65-70 miles per-hour and never skipping a beat, so I decided to go on and give it a try.  She does have to meet my needs a bit to.  And I need the mountains.

Ladies and gentlemen, The Mothership performed with strength and efficiency, and took me the miles.  The engine ran and performed admirably, in fact I believe it was cooler at the top than on more level land.  I test it after a drive by opening the bonnet and laying my hand on the rear part of the engine.  As long as I can do that and hold it there she is cooling good.

Well, I stayed at Holly Flats one nite and sort of weaved my way through the North Georgia mountains on my way back to Atlanta.  Once again on the interstate I cruised at around 65, and on the way learned about all of the affects the wind can have on steering a bus.  yeah!  what a rush.  A couple of times you couldn't have shot a 22 bullet up my butt, the pucker factor was so high.  But soon I got into a rythym and from there it was almost like sailing, sometimes you jibe, and others you tack when driving a bus.

I had a great time, and one hell of an experience.  Along the way I waved at every bus I saw, all three of them, one a very sweet 23 window.  I got waved to by children and adults looking in wanderment on the bus as they passed on the interstate.  I am not sure if they liked the way it looked or just surprised it was actually doing the same speeds they were.  I am sure the kids were asking what kind of car it was.

I got to help someone get some keys out of their car that just happened to be locked because of human error.  I also as late as I wanted and do it in my bus.  It was like a dream, or at least a portion of one come true.  The rest of the dream is yet to come with ownership of &quot;The Mothership&quot;.
