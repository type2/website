I think its only supposed to work in a limited way (at least mine does).

If the door is unlocked (ie. by the key from outside), you can lock it from
the inside with the slider. And then unlock from inside, but I don;t think
from outside!

So, its like an internal bolt thing

I never use mine

        Is the little white lock switch on the inside suppose to operate the
slider lock both ways?  unlock from inside even if locked with the key from
outside?  
It's a PITA to let the kids in the way mine works now...
