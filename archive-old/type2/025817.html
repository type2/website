You are going to need a new oil pump gasket, a short piece of straight steel
(a little carpenter's square, one with a long arm a foot long at most, will
do ya), and a set of feeler gauges to do these checks. Basically, I think
your oil pump isn't doing you any good; either the pump or the pump cover is
shot. Mainly because your rebuilder was a cheap bastid and reused the old
pump. Oil pumps should be replaced every time you rebuild the engine.

Start by removing the oil pump cover; to get to it you'll also need to
remove the crank pulley and the rear piece of tin from the engine. The oil
pump cover is the thing straight down from the end of the crankshaft, and
it's held on by four 13mm nuts on studs. Take that off, lay it down with the
side that was facing the engine up, then scrape off all the little hunks of
gasket that are stuck to your oil pump.

In there you will see two very large gears. These do the pumping. The top
one has a shaft that sticks in a slot in your camshaft; if it's jumping in
and out you will get no oil pressure. Push this gear in as far as you can,
then take the carpenter's square and put it against the oil pump body so
it's running across the top gear. Now try to stick your .005&quot; feeler gauge
between the gear and the square. If it goes in, you have too much end play
and need a new oil pump. (.004&quot; is maximum end play allowable.)

If that checks out, inspect the inside of the oil pump cover; if there are
huge spinning-gear-shaped indentations in the cover, you should get a new
cover. 

If THAT checks out, take the bottom gear out. With the index finger of one
hand, press against the center of the top gear (this is the driveshaft for
the oil pump); use the other hand's index finger to try turning the gear. It
will move a little. If you can turn it more than a couple of degrees, your
oil pump isn't engaging the camshaft and you need a new oil pump. If you do
need to replace the oil pump, change the cover as well. (Even if you shop at
my local auto parts store, you should be able to get both of these, and the
gasket, for $60. Helpful hint: buy an overhaul gasket set. It will come in
handy.) You'll also need an oil pump puller. I don't know what these cost
because one came with a Bug I bought once, but they're not very expensive.

Bandaid repair: you can cure oil pump nonengagement syndrome by using a
three jaw puller to push the driveshaft a little ways out of the gear.

To test your work before reinstalling the cover, put the crank pulley bolt
back in and turn the engine over with a wrench while you hold the gear in
place. (Transmission in neutral and parking brake on, of course.) Do the
gears turn? It's working.
