How about the wheels?  Weren't they also warped?

It's common for steel wheels to be distorted by improper lug tightening, and
alloy wheels can be cracked.  If the wheels are warped/distorted your tires
will wear unevenly and rapidly.

Do you care to name the &quot;regional chain&quot;?

&gt;&gt;  Couldn't agree more, I had my wife's Honda Civic done by a regional
chain
and the brakes warped shortly after....

...They ended up replacing the discs and drums due to distortion.
Fortunately the
bearing races survived.  &lt;&lt;
