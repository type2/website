Subject: FEATURES PAGE UPDATE

Hello Volks,

I have agreed to tackle the Features Page for the list.  I have updated the 
page and it is working properly.  Please take a look.  I am by no means an 
expert at page design, so if you have any suggestions please feel free to let 
me know.  However, if you're really gonna let me have it please do it by way 
of p-mail.  So I don't have to cry in public ;-)

Also, as I was picking up my bus from it's smog check today, there was a 
retired guy who is selling a 1980 Vanagon Camper.  All he told me was it was 
in great shape and had the full camper setup and the &quot;Interior Upgrade&quot;.  His 
wife and he used to camp a lot, but she fell and got hurt so they haven't been 
doing much over the last 4 yrs.

He is in Boulder City, NV.  If you are interested p-mail and I can head out 
there and take some pictures or get more info.  I have his phone number, but 
would rather not post it for the public record.  So if you want that, p-mail 
also.

Hope you like the new features page!!
