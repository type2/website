&gt;In addistion A board of elected list members could
&gt;act like a collective ombudsman helping to settle disputes between companies
&gt;like GEX or Midas, etc if things aren't right where a subscribing member is
&gt;concerned.

This I have thought of before, too, and I think it would be a fantastic
service but again it requires a czar. Preferably somebody with a succesful
background in sales.

It's one thing for an isolated customer to call GEX and rage against the
machine but it's another thing if you take the dispute to a mediator who
reports to the list(s), and who GEX respects as a fair arbitrator.

GEX is used here as a hypothetical example, your experience with GEX might
be completely satisfactory, insert legal discaimers, yahda yahda yahda
mumble mumble print too small to read.
