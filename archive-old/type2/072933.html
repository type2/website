Greetings all,

Well, I dropped my engine last weekend from my '69 westy and am now looking
for advice on what to do next.  I have the engine out to take care of a
clutch problem, but as long as it's sitting in my garage, I might as well
take care of some other things too.

My engine has developed a leak recently that I'd like to fix.  The problem
is I really can't tell where it's coming from.  So I turn to the all
knowing list...What are the common oil leak places and what are the fixes?
What else should I take care of while the engine is out?

Thanks so much
-James

PS Thanks to the list I am Finally getting around to replacing my fuel lines.
