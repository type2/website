I remember this...the cable snapping in the middle of nowhere...finally i 
ended up not using the stock doodoo cable at all.  I got some braided 
stainless cable (500 lb test)
and steel cable connector's, the kind with screws in them (all at the 
hardware store for about $12) shot some wd40 stuff down the hole, added an 
extra spring at the accellerator lever under the floorboard and never had to 
think or worry about it breaking again, that was 5 years ago.  I have often 
had to improve on some of the chincy design work vw did. (I expect to receive 
some flack from this last comment)...but I did the same for the gas 
pedal.._dot_used a door hinge cause the stock hinge is also doodoo...
Aloha
