Subject: steering box leaking
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com


hi all. i'm having a problem with the steering assembly on
my '77 westy. the gear box at the bottom of the steering
wheel shaft is leaking a thick black fluid very slowly. so
far there has been no noticeable effect on the steering,
but i'm worried about it nonetheless. also, i'm not sure if
this is related, but i notice a strange and unpleasant odor
whenever i make a hard left turn at low speed. yes, i
shower frequently, so i'm figuring it might have something
to do with the black fluid (spare me the x-files jokes).
does anybody know what the deal is? does the gear box need
to be rebuilt? is that difficult?

danke,
ben
