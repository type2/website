Subject: Re: [T2] Which Distributor?

&gt;At the risk of opening a can of worms, and a big debate, I'd like to know 
&gt;the if it is best to stay with my stock distributor and points or should I 
&gt;invest in a &quot;Bosh 009&quot; and the Pertronix Ignitor, as offered by Ron and 
&gt;the gang at BD?  Or switch to electronic ignitor and keep the old distributor?

Stock dist and Pertronix is a good solution. Keep points and condensor and 
screwdriver in van for replacement in case the Pertronix dies. The 
Pertronix will change the dwell and timing a little so perhaps a lister can 
tell us what to set it at.

There are Pertronix versions I and II. The second version is better I've 
heard.

They require specific installation with a reduced voltage I think and a 
coil with a specific resistance. The archives has alot about it. I'll be 
the library does too. Versions I and versions II have different requirements.

I posted a message at one point that had some of the requirements about 6 
months ago.
