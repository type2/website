&gt; Upon reaching a speed of around 55-60 mph, the Bus would start
&gt; making an irregular whirring/vibrating noise.  

Sounds like the speedo cable.
You could unscrew it from the speedo and spray some lube down the cable 
casing.
Tri3 Teflon spray should reactivate the lube that is still present on the 
cable.
