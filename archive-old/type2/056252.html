Hi Volks,

David Greenland &lt;greenl.d_at_apple_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; My hitch is rated at 110lbs tongue weight and 1100 max towing, but that
&gt; may be a limitation on the way it's mounted (using the rear bumper mounts).
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has a hitch rated higher than that, I'd like to know how it's
&gt; mounted. (on a '75)

On my '72, it's rated for 1,200 kg max towing weight.  It consists of 
a tubular structure with brackets welded to it.  The brackets bolt to 
where the bumper mounts normally bolt, and the bumper bolts to the 
tubular stucture.  The actual &quot;hook&quot; bolts to the tube too, through 
the bumper.  The original bumper mounts are obsoleted.

For '73 and later, I've seen similar hitches, but with the &quot;hook&quot; 
welded to the tube.  These come in either 1,200 kg or 1,800 kg 
versions.

Yours,
    Erik.
