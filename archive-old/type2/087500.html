Subject: Re: [T2] Valve covers - removal and replacement

&gt;Do any solid-lifter T4 owners have any tricks for getting those stubborn
&gt;bails off and on when adjusting valves?

 jason - what i have been doing is dabbing a finger coating of old engine
oil on the raised parts of the valve cover where the bail wire hits, then
pry. lubrication, my man, for everything.   - steve
