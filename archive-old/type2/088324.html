Subject: Re: [T2] Buying a bus for the first time...

&gt; Some sellers behave as if buses have real antique value even though they
need major repairs.  It's real easy to put $2000 in a used bus before you
know it.  Find out what work needs to be done and what it will cost before
you buy.
&gt;
Well, someday they may have real antique value, but just not yet. The early
Packard that my dad used to use as a daily driver is now worth almost a half
a million dollars.. The only problem is, that he sold it many, many years
ago, when he still thought of it as a &quot;beater&quot;. He paid originally $50.00!

I am not disappointed at all if I start with a decent chassis and after
major repairs have $2,000 in it. That is a heck of a bargain, in my opinion,
because then you know what you have, and it is a fully functional vehicle
that you can get a lot of use for, and that you wouldn't even lose much if
you were forced to sell it. If you can hang onto it, in my opinion, it is
only going to become gradually more valuable, as these buses have a great
nostalgia and collector's value to at least two generations now. But, where
are you going to find one of these to buy (for the current prices) in ten
more years? You can still buy a good chassis with a blown engine for a
little over $500, maybe less. At that price you can afford to put some money
into it, and end up with a great car. $2,000 is entirely reasonable to
invest in a sound used car, and you can get a lot for that kind of money in
a VW bus.  Jan B
