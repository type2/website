Don't register it as a Westfalia - register it as a Transporter.

Same vehicle.

Different accessories.

I have insurance with State Farm and have had not problems.

Change agents and tell you agent if he wants your business, then he better 
give you a break and quit giving your grief.

If this thing was a body conversion with the rear half hacked off and a 
larger body added on or the weight was significantly different than a 
passenger van, then I think he would have an argument.

This is the same body, more or less the same weight, and the same drivetrain.

Tell them to go just in the lake and switch agents. Bet he begs you to come 
back.

Wonder if he gets paid based on the cost of the policy? Higher cost, higher 
pay off for him.

&gt; &gt; &quot;temporary dwelling&quot;, it is now classified as a motorhome.
&gt;
&gt;My insurance agent with State Farm would not let me &quot;add on&quot; my '78
&gt;Westfalia to my Jeep's existing policy.
&gt;
&gt;He said becuase the Westfalia is officially considered a motor home by the
&gt;insurance industry, I had to buy a separate/second policy, and could not
&gt;list it as a &quot;second vehicle&quot; on my Jeep's policy.
&gt;
&gt;I have not stopped by the DMV yet to register my recent purchase, but your
&gt;encounter with &quot;Ms. DMV&quot; doesn't seem out of line to me.
