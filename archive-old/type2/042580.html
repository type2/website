Subject: C V Joints

Greetings....
I am currently doing the CV on my 74 Bus...thanks to list for help.
I think the used ones will work out fine... they better!!!

Just for price reference...I called my local Official
Volkswagen dealer...inquiring about new CV joints ???

Now keep in mind these are Canadian prices......
the friendly parts man tells me..yes.they have them in stock...
and it will only cost me  ..    $290.00 per CV joint....but
this also includes the boot  and the grease ???????

Give me a break.... lets see  $290  x 4.. = $1,160 ????

Ya.....I think the used ones will work out real WELL...
No wonder nobody shops at the VW dealer....



Glen
