Subject: RE: Subaru conversions

We use the Subaru EA-81 boxer engine in homebuilt aircraft.  It was in
the Brat and some
of the sedans.  It's built like a water-cooled bug engine - flat four,
1800cc, probably 
about 65 hp.  I'm converting one right now to replace the two-stroke in
my Avid Flyer
float plane.  Now that you mention it, it would make a bitch'n bus
engine, except I don't 
know where you'd put the radiator ( or the propeller :v) ).

&gt; For years I've heard of these as the conversion engines and someone described
&gt; them as &quot;boxer&quot; engines the other day. Anyone on the list actually done or
&gt; seen one of these?
