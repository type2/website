Last night I completed assembly of my 78 2L Type IV basic engine.  The heads are new as well as the pistons, cylinders, push rod tubes etc.  The next step according to the manual was installing the cylinder head temperature sending unit in the left cylinder head.  Upon observation, the threaded hole for the CHT unit was located on the right side of my engine.  This freaked me out and now Im wondering if it makes a difference whether or not a head goes on one side or the other?  I cant see that it would make a difference as the heads appear identical to me other than the CHT mounting hole.  Please inform a newbie on what sounds to me like a simple question.  

Thanks in advance list members
