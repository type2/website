&gt; Ever wonder how your oil leaks end up covering your back window?  Well,
&gt; air flows under your bus, and once it hits the end of the bus, it shoots
&gt; upwards, carrying your oil drips with it. It seems to me that this would
&gt; also carry the hot air from the exhaust up, too. And if your deck lid is
&gt; open, HOT air is being pulled into the engine bay.  Am I correct in
&gt; thinking this?
