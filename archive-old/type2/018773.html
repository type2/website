Subject: 79 type 2 vacuum lines
Message-ID: &lt;378B43DD.4B96_at_primenet_dot_com&gt;

I have a 79 type 2 with fuel injection.  I am not sure of the proper
hook up on the vacuum lines from the distributor to the intake air
distributor, decel valve and fuel pressure regulator.  I have looked in
many places and there are no diagrams that show the complete vacumm
system hooked.  
Can someone please help!!!!!

Thanks Bill
