Subject: Engine cover plates

I need to also replace a cover plate that is below my number three cylinder
and the manifold on the left side. I am not sure what piece it is because I
have not taken the piece out. Can someone point me to the right part on these
pics?

On this pic, it looks like it would be the next piece behind part 20, but I am
not sure.

On this pic it might be part 18?

I see some tin for sale on The Samba, but want to make sure I get the right
stuff. Also, can all this tin be removed from the bus with the engine still in
the bus?

Thanks,
Corbett
