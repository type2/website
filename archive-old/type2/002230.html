Subject: 68 Poptop Question
Date: Sun, 20 May 2001 14:15:10 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 68 Westy that has no poptop on it at this time. It came with a
poptop, but not the original . I do not know how it mounts back on the bus.
There are hinges on the bus, and hinges on the poptop that look like they
came off of the donor bus. I just ordered canvas and seals. Can someone
point me in the right direction?

Thanks!
