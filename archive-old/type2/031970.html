Sean:

I'd SWEAR I followed Wilson's instructions to the letter installing 
the distributor driveshafts on the two engines I'm rebuilding, but I don't 
think either one of the engines ended up correctly timed.  Others have 
reported the same results.  Either Wilson is wrong, or none of us can 
follow instructions.  

I re-set one of the distributor driveshafts just yesterday, but didn't 
think to note how far off it was from &quot;correct.&quot;  I'll bet it was some 
multiple of 90 degrees.

Before I fix the other engine I'll see if I end up with the same results 
you did.  In fact, didn't somebody else (a newbie with an '80 Vanagon) 
post just a day or two ago about a distributor timed the same as yours?  
Probably another &quot;Wilson&quot; rebuild.

&gt; also static-timed it to get a baseline setting.  While doing this I found
&gt; out I screwed something up with the distributor or distributor driveshaft
&gt; installation, because now when the distributor is oriented like it's
&gt; supposed to be on the engine, the notch in the rim is where #2 is when the
&gt; timing mark is lined up with the seam in the crankcase.  D'OH!  Well I just
&gt; switched around the plug wires and have not thought much about it.  Anyone
&gt; know what I did wrong?
