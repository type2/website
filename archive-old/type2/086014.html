That or get the Bosch WR-1 relay kit from an import shop or mail order. I 
paid 12 dukats for mine. Greatest thing since sliced bread!
'Hope that helps!

&gt;Any Ford. Visit any flaps. You need one with two large lugs that were used 
&gt;for the battery cables in a Ford and one little terminal for the wire that 
&gt;connected to the key switch.
&gt;
&gt;Many also came with two little terminals. No harm done, leave the second 
&gt;small terminal unconnected.
&gt;
&gt;Lawn Tractor relays are good.
&gt;
&gt;Motorcycle relays are good. I bought a Yamaha relay last week for $30 verus 
&gt;the $120 for the Honda relay for my Honda motorcycle.
&gt;
&gt;You could use a 30 amp Radio Shack relay for $6 but it isn't weather proof.
&gt;
&gt;I like the lawn mower or Ford relay best.

&gt;&gt;Get a color wiring schematic. Bentley has them in black and white but
&gt;&gt;labels every wire so you can still follow it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't have it close at hand so I can't tell you facts....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In short from memory - the terminal on the solenoid is from the key. If 
&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;apply 12 volts positive here the starter will try to engage. That is what
&gt;&gt;you accomplish with the key. The key switch will fail about every 20 years
&gt;&gt;or so and fail to supply 12v+ to the solenoid. Also from time to time the
&gt;&gt;solenoid will bind so despite the fact that the key is supplying 12v+ the
&gt;&gt;solenoid will still fail to function. In that case a few light whacks with
&gt;&gt;a hammer on the side of the solenoid will usually get you moving. In this
&gt;&gt;case build a starter relay as per the plans in the back of the Muir book.
&gt;&gt;The VW catalogs have them in kits but you can do the same with an old Ford
&gt;&gt;starter relay (much more heavy duty than a headlight relay found in the
&gt;&gt;catalog kits) and you might have a Ford relay laying around. I am assuming
&gt;&gt;that when you short the terminals on the starter with a screwdriver the
&gt;&gt;engine starts cranking 'til it fires up (normally)... if not then you have
&gt;&gt;your symptoms mixed up.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Also any other wire on the solenoid will be hot only when the key is in 
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;start position.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can't think of any other thing on a carb bus that needs to be doing
&gt;&gt;something only while the bus is starting.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With a test meter and a friend you can pull the wires that connect to the
&gt;&gt;starter solenoid and with the key in the start position one of these wires
&gt;&gt;should be hot each time the switch is turned to &quot;start&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The starter itself has a large cable from the battery. I think the
&gt;&gt;alternator also may be connected the starter cable with a smaller red wire
&gt;&gt;(larger than the wires on the solenoid).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Safety: do not lay in front of the tire - you don't want the bus to move
&gt;&gt;forward or backward and run over you.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Make sure that your helper knows how to pull the main coil wire to kill 
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;engine should in your experiments the engine start and the helper somehow
&gt;&gt;discover that it won't shut off (they break the key)... Make sure that 
&gt;&gt;your
&gt;&gt;helper knows that they can push in the clutch and the van will not move
&gt;&gt;when the engine is running.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I know some of us use young family members and girlfriends (or boyfriends)
&gt;&gt;that either might not know what to do if there was a shadetree mechanic
&gt;&gt;emergency or they panic and forget what to do...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Neutral, brake on, etc...
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;I've been reading the book &quot;How To Keep Your VolksWagen Alive, a Manual 
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;Step By Step Procedures For The Complete Idiot&quot; and apparently I'm 
&gt;&gt;beyond a
&gt;&gt; &gt;complete idiot.(&lt;-- Be Nice) While working on the starter I noticed one 
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;the wires that hooks to the solenoid was broken and probably had been 
&gt;&gt;for
&gt;&gt; &gt;awhile. (Two weeks ago the bus would turn over fine.) According to the
&gt;&gt;book,
&gt;&gt; &gt;one of the wires on the solenoid goes to the ignition switch and the 
&gt;&gt;other
&gt;&gt; &gt;is labeled Fuel Injection. I have a '71 Westfalia. No fuel injection 
&gt;&gt;there.
&gt;&gt; &gt;But I can't seem to track where the wire goes or it's purpose. I took a
&gt;&gt;look
&gt;&gt; &gt;at another '71 running bus and the wire was hooked up on there too. Can
&gt;&gt; &gt;anyone help me with this? I've been trying to troubleshoot why I don't 
&gt;&gt;have
&gt;&gt; &gt;12volts to the ignition switch. I can turn over the starter by jumping 
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;posts on the solenoid. Is the second wire a return from the ignition
&gt;&gt;switch?
&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm guessing that the first one is running from the solenoid to the fuse
&gt;&gt;box
&gt;&gt; &gt;then to the ignition??? Any help is appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.
