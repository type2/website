Subject: RE:  thermostat problems

&gt;   I installed a new thermostat and cable and pulled the flaps closed 
&gt;and connected the wire, I double checked the second time( it 
&gt;happened twice) that it was on the pulley b4 attaching my tin. I drive 
&gt;it 20 mins to work and the damn wire comes off the pulley and the flaps 
&gt;are wide open. I cant figure this out. Has anyone had a similar problem 
&gt;or suggestions ?

I had the exact same problem recently.  After the 3rd time (ain't it a pain
in the ass to get the cable back on that stinking pulley?) I made SURE it
was adjusted correctly.  The reason it is coming off is that there is too
much slack in the cable when the flaps are full open and the thermostat is
fully expanded (hot engine).  So what you want to do is get you motor warmed
up all the way and adjust the cable so there is no (or very little) slack
with the thermostat fully expanded (hot) and the flaps fully open.
