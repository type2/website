You may recall the two free buses in Virginia were on the list about a week
ago.  My freind Roy was tired of feeling left out because he did not have a
bus so he went and got them. The 74 auto is a goner but the 75 westy is in
need of a motor to put it back on the road. Does anyone have a running
1.7,1.8 or 2.0 that they need to get off the garage floor so they can have a
little cash for the holidays? How about a wrecked 72 or up bus that would
like to be an organ donor?

BTW the bus is COMPLETELY stripped of its camping interior so if you have
any 74 to 75 camper interioir parts cluttering up the place let me know and
I will find a home for them.
