Subject: Re: [T2] fuel rail port 

Note that the stock connections use hose and clamp and are very secure if 
you use the proper sized hose and a proper f.i. clamp. Same will work for 
your gauge, so no need for a special fitting.

&gt;HI Folks,
&gt;         Does anyone have a source for a screw in nipple for the fuel rail
&gt;pressure port.  I would like to connect up my pressure meter while driving
&gt;but want a secure connection.  Thanks. jon
