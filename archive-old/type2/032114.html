Subject: solex 30 pict 3 throttle valve stop screw--size and pitch?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.PTX.4.05.9812161609220.17993-100000_at_odin.cc.pdx_dot_edu&gt;


Hi, folks:

my throttle valve stop screw went missing--might still be in some dark
corner of the engine compartment, but I'm guessing not.  

Can anyone help me with the size/pitch info to replace it--I'm figuring
I'll need a screw and a nut to stop it, right?

thanks
