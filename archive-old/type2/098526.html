Subject: Re: [T2] colorful levers (was: Heating Problems)

you mean the left isnt just the left vent and the right isnt just the
right one? damn, i have so much to learn about this bus! would that
explain why the right red lever only goes down about half way? if it is
supposed to go down farther, how do i adjust it? dont think i have ever
heard any motors when i play with those knobs... will test tomorrow. the
70 has this motor?

ok, so the green knobs control the amount of fresh air? damn, someone
explain all 4 levers, please... and while we're at it, what is the small
knob on the front of the seat? (70 westy) i know the big knob adjusts the
seat so what is the other one?

thanks!
