Subject: Sunroof question

I have a 1970 Bus with a sunroof.

The sunroof does work off of the crank anymore...the crank is busted.

Also, it looks like someone put in troughs on both sides so the sunroof
could be manually moved.

I don't see the cables in place either.

My question:  where can I get all of the parts (seal, new crank, cables) in
one package?  I have checked west coast metric and they don't have the
cables available.

Any ideas?  Has anyone restored one of these?

Thanks in advance.
