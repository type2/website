Subject: Hot bus won't start
Message-ID: &lt;206190b9.24a99d68_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello list:

I've just spent the past hour looking through the archives at all the various 
postings that address this problem: After a long run, when the engine gets 
hot, the bus won't start. 

I have this problem with my 72 Westy. Actually, I have two problems: Nothing 
happens at all when I turn the key (dash lights, radio, etc. work fine); or 
the starter cranks over very slowly after a slight delay, then starts the bus.

According to what I've read, this problem can be due to faulty wiring that 
doesn't conduct enough juice from the battery to the starter when the wiring 
gets hot. Or, the points in the solenoid stick together. 

So, the question is: Why would solenoid points stick when under heat stress? 
Is this situation related to the wiring? 

I'm trying to figure out how to attack this problem: Either get a new 
solenoid, or install a relay to get more juice to the starter. Seems that 
even a new solenoid wouldn't work properly if it's not receiving enough 
voltage.

Thoughts?
