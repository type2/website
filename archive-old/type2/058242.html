Subject: Re.Wipers not contacting screen

Hi Philip,

I have also had this problem with my RHD Crew Cab and 
previously with my (ex)'74 camper.
You mention that you recently changed your wiper blades
and your choice of replacement blade is where the problem 
often lies.

Many replacement blades are a one piece item of the
rubber blade and a plastic backing strip with a groove
that slides into the wiper arm clips and is too stiff and
won't allow the rubber blade to properly follow the contour
of the screen.
The original blades are very soft and also have a seperate
&quot;bendy&quot; metal backing strip to which the rubber blade is fixed.
You retain this metal bit and only change the rubber blade.

Over the years,most of these go missing as blades are changed
to after-market generic wiper blades and this is when you
start to have difficulty making contact with the screen,
often right in the line of sight (Murphy's Law : the
probability of something occuring is in inverse ratio to 
it's desirability!)

So,if the above is true in your case,I suggest trying to
find some of the metal backing strips at a VW junk yard and
get some of the correct rubber blades from a VW parts supplier.
This will normally get rid of the problem.

If you do have the original metal bits and your blades don't
contact the screen properly,you will need to sacrifice blade
contact at the extremes of the wiper arm travel where the screen
curves the most and subtlely bend the blades to meet the screen
in the middle where you need it most.In my experience a
compromise of this sort is usually called for...

Does this happen with LHD vehicles too?....._dot_comments anyone?
