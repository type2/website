&gt; Euro specs tailights have amber on them, US don't.
&gt; For example my '69 bus is swiss market specs and the tailights are 
&gt; amber/red white US specs are
&gt; solid red. Models after 71 are amber/red/white for Euro, red/red/white for 
&gt; US specs. Turn signals are

&gt; &gt;&gt;Is the general consensus inthe bus community when ordering
&gt; &gt;&gt;parts is that the Euro spec tail lenses are red/amber/white
&gt; &gt;&gt;and the US spec tail lenses are red/red/white?  Or is this backwards?

now I'm really confused.  I just ordered a set of the taillight assemblies
and ordered amber/red/white and was told they were Euro spec taillights,

now my 78 delivered in the USA (got the birth cert) came with
amber/red/white so it should be USA spec....?????

and the list now can't make up my mind so did they change at some point??
most of the later ones I see on the USA roads seem to have the
amber/red/white when I notice
