Subject: Dented Pushrods

I'm in the middle of the rebuild of my 79 2.0 and she's looking mighty
clean. Can't believe how much gunk had built up on the case and tin!

Anyway, I'm now getting ready to slide the pushrod tubes back in with new
seals and noticed that 7 of the 8 tubes have dents in them. Most are minor,
almost like they got dinged with a pebble, but a couple have some pretty
deep dings. When I look in the inside I can see the dents... but no holes.

So how critical is it to oil flow that the tubes be totally smooth or can I
get away with putting the tubes back in the bus?

Thanks!
Chris in Windsor, CT
