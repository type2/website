Hey Volks,
I thought I would share this with you.
I went to my local VW dealer yesterday to order a thermostat bracket for my
1976 Westy, I hate to buy from VW 'cause they are VERY pricey($70.00 for a
thermostat), but no one else seems to have it. While I was there I noticed
the parts screen showed engine tin , naturally I inquired as to whether it
was actually available. Indeed it was(is). They do not have all the
pieces,but they had 4(now 3) of the left rear tin that is often ripped out
for A/C($28.00). I am in Florida so the parts are being shipped from VW's
Jacksonville warehouse. It will be here Thursday, I will let you know if it
fits... So if you need tin , try your local VW dealer.
