Hi All
I need to remove valve guides from 80 Vanagon head. I have milled the
shoulder off flush with the aluminum but but
Bently is not at all clear as to what size drill is to be used to drill
down about 2&quot; before driving out the guide or where to drive with the
drift. I can make up a drift if I
 only knew how. All this, in the absence of the specal VW tools,
obviously.
Thanks for what I am sure will be everything I need to know from all
knowing Netters
