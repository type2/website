Subject: Re: [T2] Importing Vehicle From Mexico

I seem to recall reading that those in the US who have done so started with
a properly imported US Beatle, strip it down to the pan and then they
completely strip the mexi bug down and reassemble it on the US import Beatle
pan that has a properly registerable VIN Vehicle Identification Number on
it. A lot of work, not sure what gymnastics you would have to do for Canada
or for that matter the legality of doing it in the US... seems to have
worked for them anyway.

Not very topical question for a Type 2 Bus list though... ;-) I won't reply
further, search the net.
