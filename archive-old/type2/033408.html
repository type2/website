I get this a lot too from the girlfriend... oh well.

&gt;  1) How much time is too much time to spend
&gt; working on a vehicle that has already had everything rebuilt, and runs well?

can you ever spend enough time?

&gt;
&gt; 2) Is it manditory to &quot;tweak&quot; things on a regular basis?

you betcha!

&gt; 3) How many
&gt; accessorys does a Delux ' 78 Westphalia camper need, anyway?

It needs more.

&gt; And the Big One:
&gt; Is my husband the only one who looks at his westy and gets &quot;excited&quot;( I've
&gt; seen him actually running his hands over the bus and drooling...Strange, at
&gt; least in my book...)

What book is that?  He was just bonding with the bus.  Keeping it calm, admiring
its great shine and beautiful texture.  When you're nice to your bus, your bus is
nice to you.

&gt; ( whos husband mumbled something about &quot;wheel Bearings&quot; this
&gt; morning and wandered off into the garage 2 hours ago...)

I should really do mine too ;)

hope this helps..hehe
