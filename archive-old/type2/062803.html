Subject: Re: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat?

This is false information.  There were 7, 8, and 9 passenger buses 
and I have the model numbers and m-codes to prove it.  ;)

I'll post the info when I get back in town Monday.

Respectfully,

Dave

&gt;Non-walkthroughs (24s) were all nine seaters.  What 'officially' 
&gt;distinguished 25s (walk-throughs) from 24s were not the fact they 
&gt;were 'walkthrough' but the fact they were 7 seaters......
&gt;
&gt;What I'm trying to say in a most convoluted manner is that 
&gt;non-walkthroughs were all (originally) 9 seaters  and all 
&gt;walk-throughs were 7 seaters....
