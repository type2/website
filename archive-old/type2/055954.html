I just wanted to say thanx to everyone that helped me with my radio
problems...after 6 hours and 6 trips to three different hardware/auto store's
i have finally got my radio installed nicely and wired and working
properly...a few of you gave me info that proved not to work in my bus...but
thanx for the efforts!
peace
dave
