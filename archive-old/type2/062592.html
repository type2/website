Subject: Dometic fridge

Is there a repair book or manual available for the Dometic fridge? Mine in
the 81 works well on gas and 110v(or at least it did once) but doesn't hit a
lick on 12v. I'd like to be able to work with this myself rather than take it
to a RV dealer if possible. Thanks for any help.
