I use thick paper gaskets for this joint.  Never seen one with asphalt
cooking out of it!

Metal gaskets work too.  I put a _very_ light smear of hylomar (_not_
RTV!) on either type of gasket to seal up any scratches.

&gt; (BTW: I'm aware of the issues around using bolts instead of studs.
&gt; However, I'd rather have the bus running with the wrong fasteners and
&gt; the risks associated, than have the bus set waiting for new or fixed
&gt; heads.)

The other danger is that you (or the next owner) won't remember why some
bolts have multiple washers.  This happened to me on the rear mount bolts
and I was lucky that I noticed that the bolt had bottomed out before the
head made contact.  I now shorten any bolt that bottoms out so that the
proper number of washers will work.  It's helpful to get a few paint
pencils of various colors so you can color-code which bolt goes with which
hole.
