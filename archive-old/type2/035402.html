Subject: Re: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

I wonder why any shop that rebuilds heads (welding cracks, replacing and 
cutting seats, pressing in guides) couldn't also do whatever MSHP does 
when it chisel-crimps the seats. I understand that it's a proprietary 
process, but it can't be rocket science.

Notwithstanding Ron's testimonial about AVP heads, it seems to me that a 
guarantee on heads is less than comforting if you have to drop your 
engine, dismantle it, and ship the heads off to get any satisfaction. 
More likely one does as I have done with my MSHP head with the misaligned 
exhaust port: shave the header to fit, and live with it.

But if I had gotten my heads from a local shop, you can bet that I would 
drive down there and not leave until they had installed a satisfactory 
head at their expense.

(The fact that MSHP doesn't guarantee the head, only the seats, is 
meaningless in the first year if you pay with a credit card -- American 
Express, anyway -- since the products is defacto guaranteed. Even so, I 
wouldn't ship my fingernail trimmings to MSHP, let alone a head.)
