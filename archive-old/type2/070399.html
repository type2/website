Subject: Newbie in Boulder, CO

Hi everyone!

I am a &quot;newbie' bus owner, having recently purchased a '70 bus (some of
you may know it as &quot;Matty J's blue bus&quot;)...Anyway, it's my first bus and
all, and I'm a little hesitant about doing my own valves at this stage.
Anybody know anyone in the Boulder area that's good at that sort of
thing???  

Been reading about all the sticker issues...I have outfitted my bus with
the standard steal your face, dancing bears, peace symbol, and more to
follow.   I hope the man won't be hasslin me!!
