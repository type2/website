Subject: Re: [T2] A funny thing happened on my way to the forum...

&gt; If you have never learned to shift without using the
&gt; clutch, now is a good time to learn. Muir describes it

This is a good trick to learn. The basic idea is that you need to match the
speed of the transmission to the speed of the engine (what the clutch forces).
It's much easier with a tachometer. Basically, every up-shift drops the RPM by
about 1000 (need to monitor this on the bus, my 911 was almost exactly 1000
rpm). So if you are cruising in 2nd gear at 3000 rpm and you want to go to
3rd, pop the transmission in neutral, drop the rpms to 2000 (and hold), then
gently push into third. The more you do it, the easier it gets. And it's
definitely a 'feel' thing.
