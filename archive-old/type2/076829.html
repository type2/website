Owner...

Thank you for your time.  I am wanting to post just one message on your
board and I don't need to receive any messages back.  I don't even own a
VW bus but I need one part from it.  Could you please post a want ad for
me.  I need type 2 VW axles ONLY.  The ones I need are 18.75 inches long.
Have them call me at my shop or e-mail me at this e-mail.  Thank you!

Sincerely,
Scott &gt;&gt;&gt; Renegade Hybrids!
