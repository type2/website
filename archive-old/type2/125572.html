Subject: Re: [T2] my wife wants a price/amount estimate

Hmm, I'm sure somone else will have more precise info sooner or later, but. . . . .  I would GUESS based on the pickup we're currently doing, that a Bus would take about 1 gallon a coat. And ya' need at least one primer coat, one color coat, and one clear coat. Well, you can get paints that don't require clear coat, but their not too nice. 

For the sandable primer we're using; it costs just under $250 for the gallon of primer, the reducer, the activator, a couple of little plastic mixing cups, and some strainers. After one good solid coat, the Gallon can is just about empty. 

We're doing Fire Red (a ford color) and it's a really nice red color with lots of &quot;pearl&quot; in it. So it's pretty pricey. It cost about $600 for the paint and activators and stuff.

The clear coat is actually pretty cheap. I think it was like $300 for several coats worth. 

So I guess I'd say about $1,000 if it all goes good and you don't have to redo anything for a REALLY REALLY good paint job done with PPG paint. When at the store I asked about their SUPER LOW END stuff, and the said that the stuff to use, if your just wanting to paint it up and sell it, would cost about $500 for the whole job. 

However just the other day I found a paint called MONTANA paint. The primer was $80 for a gallon KIT. So along with all the activators and stuff it was WELL under half price of the PPG paint. I have no clue as to how good of paint it is though. I'll prolly end up using either Montana paint or just going to Maaco to get it done. :)

Hope it helps
Chris



&gt; Cost is a concern, but the equipment and know how (her uncle is a painter)
&gt; is available.
