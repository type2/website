Subject: Re: westy roof rack?

&gt;Is there such a thing as a Westy roof rack? I want to carry bikes and the
&gt;occassional canoe up there, but I also want to be able to pop the top with
&gt;relative ease. 

Hi Bob,

Glad to hear your oil pressure woes are over :).

The archived list post I'm including below from Mike Mott confirms that
using the Thule super high feet #953 will allow load bars to clear a
baywindow poptop when secured to the stock rain gutter.  Of course, you will
need to remove your rack cargo and one load bar if you intend to pop the
top. If you speak with a Thule representative they will likely try to steer
you toward the artificial rain gutter that bolts to the poptop itself
(requiring a backing plate reinforcement) and the shorter feet (as stated in
their catalog and website).  This allows you to pop the top with a load up
there, but I'd imagine this would require some effort and I wouldn't go this
route without also reinforcing the fiberglas where it mounts to the poptop
hinge bracket and examining the hinge hardware for wear/weakness and
replacing/reinforcing parts as necessary.  This is one area where overkill
is appropriate.  Incidentally, also according to first hand accounts in the
archives, the super high feet will clear the vanagon poptop as well. 65&quot;
load bars are recommended, but some folks buy 78&quot; bars and cut them down
slightly so that two canoes can be conveniently mounted.

You'll find that the #953 feet are a special order item for most Thule
distributors.  Talking to more than one I learned that back order problems
on the special order items are common.   After they place an order to their
supplier you could end up waiting 2-3 weeks.  Even wwww.Ageebike_dot_com (they
had the best Thule prices on the Net and appear to be a high volume
distributor) didn't have these feet in stock, though they did say two weeks
ago that they were on order for another customer and were expected within a
week or so.  Contact Mike Mott for more info on using the Thule rack, I only
recently researched this issue because I was looking for any rack that would
mount over the poptop and would be suitable for carrying a canoe among other
things. If you are in the US and have a &quot;Mickey Finn&quot; store nearby (I'm in
CT, not sure if they are a national chain though), they will also have a
good price on the Thule parts.  For the type of rack I use over my poptop to
carry a canoe, see my additional comments below Mike's post.

&gt;&gt;10: My quest led me to rack specialists on the web located in CT. (search on -
&gt;&gt;11: Roof Rack - any web search engine)

&gt;&gt;13: I took a chance and ordered the Thule 953 Foot Pack on Monday, got em
&gt;&gt;14: today.  Tried them out and they were high enough! :)
&gt;&gt;15: 
&gt;&gt;16: Fired up the bus and drove up to a bike store and bought the 65&quot; bars.
&gt;&gt;17: Slapped them on at the store and was overcome by a vision of a canoe on

My alternative:

I was recently scrambling to find a way to mount a canoe atop my '71 poptop
westy and I didn't want to use the foam block method.  Thanks to the
generosity of Greg Kriss, a friend, fellow listy and workmate all rolled
into one,  I now have a 2/3 roof length rack mounted over the center of my
poptop.  It's an original six leg steel rack that was either custom or
factory modified by cutting each leg about 5 inches from its base and adding
a roughly 5&quot; long aluminum rod extender between the tubing so that the rack
is high enough to clear the poptop.  The aluminum is curved to match the
contour of the roof and its mid section matches the thickness of the steel
rack tubing, but at its ends it has been turned down to a smaller diameter
to fit into the steel tube.  It is secured to the steel tube on either end
by a stainless steel bolt and nut.

I'm using two styles of stock factory hardtop bus style roofrack clamps
(simply because I could only get three of each style or I would've just used
all the same).  By rigging some threaded rod and eye bolts as extenders I
was able to secure the rack very well.  Avid poptop users will disapprove
because installation of such a rack renders the poptop useless.   I don't
typically pop the top so this wasn't a problem for me.  However, having a
2/3 or full size rack is extremely useful for carrying all types of bulky
items.  I have not yet measured the height with the rack installed and with
the canoe on top, but I do know I can easily clear a parking garage with a 7
foot clearance with the rack alone.  I'd highly recommend this modification
to poptop bus owners who don't use their poptop feature (probably mostly
68-73 owners).  It's probably the most utilitarian addition I've made to the
bus since I installed the gas heater.  I don't have a webpage, but if there
is an interest and someone wants to host pics of this setup I can take some
shots of the details.
