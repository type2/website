Subject: Set screws in head - another hypothesis

Ok. I just took a nice long 100mm M10x1.25 bolt and dropped it into the
'front' (towards the back of the vehicle) hole where I was trying to
thread my M10x1.00 set screw with worsening results. The bolt seemed to
bottom-out and not actually make contact on the sides. I can slide the
bolt in and out and 'scrape' the edges of the whole. If I leave it in
there and start the engine, I can press the bolt and feel the valve
lifting!

So here's the new hypothesis: the holes are stripped out or never were
M10! I'm going to run out to Ace Hardware and look for a couple M12 bolts
and an M12 tap. Maybe I can tap the outer part of the hole and get the
bolts in. Otherwise, should I fill the hole with JB Weld, drill, tap and
fill with a bolt? Or maybe just JB Weld the holes shut? Any clues on how
to keep the JB weld in the holes?

This 'hole' exercise would have been a breeze if I just dropped the
engine. Then I could inspect the problem directly...

-Eric
