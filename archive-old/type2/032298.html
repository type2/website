Subject: How do I wire the Fuel Pump?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0103192130490.5522-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;

Hi everyone...

My struggle with this fuel pump continues....
I am sitting here with the relay and wiring diagram in front of me, but
for some reason I can't get this to work. I know the relay and pump
are in working order. Could someone please tell me how
to wire the FI fuel pump from the double relay. There are 6 terminals
involved on the relay. (86a,88y,85,88z,86c,88d) Where are they supposed to
go? I'm missing the harness that was designed for this. Are they
available anywhere? Or is there an easier way to do this?


TIA
Eddie
