&gt; KEY WAYS ARE NOT CRITICAL.  For proper pulley and fan performance, PROPER

&gt; Never heard anyone say this!  That the Bosch says the woodruff key is
&gt; optional. New info to me.  I'm using one anyway (and the AL82N does have key
&gt; ways on the shaft).  I just thought that this bit of info might be of
&gt; interest to the list.

Hmm.

I guess this doesnt surprise me much.  All of the alternators I have seen
don't use a woodruff key.  They also use a different pulley. (warning,
warning!:)

The shaft on the alternator is tapered (I guess it qualifies as a Morris
Taper..), and the pulley is made to slip onto this.  Splitty steeering
wheels use the same idea.

The pulley is just a shade small (well, the front (FIF) of the pully..)
for the shaft, and when you torque the thing togethor, it forces the
pulley up the shaft, and creates a press-fit.  

99% of the generators I have seen use a straight shaft, with keyway, etc.
I have one laying around that doesnt, though.  It uses the same taper as
the alternator.

just my few pennies...:)

FLAPS.  damn thing looks new!  lifetime warrently, blah blah...aint always
worth paying the Bosch price..;p )
