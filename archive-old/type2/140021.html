Hello Don  Being in the buz of working on every known car in the world I have 
a drawer full of oil wrenches . There are about 4 types like these and they 
work really well when you can get them in there to the oil filter. They wont 
work on every car. I also have a bunch of band types that came from snap-on that 
are heavy duty .   later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
