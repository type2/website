======================&gt;
I did mine last week, and packed only the joint.

I would tend to think the purpose of the boot is to keep &quot;just&quot;the joint
clean, not contain extra grease.

To pack the boot might put you in the position of having it, over time,
become contaminated so as to also contaminate the joint !?
