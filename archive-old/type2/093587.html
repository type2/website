Subject: A/C for a Baywindow

Hey everyone,

A buddy of mine is in serious need of an A/C system for a '72 bus.  Can
anyone direct me/him to a seller of A/C kits?

There used to be a place that offered the whole kit but I cannot remember
what shop.

At worst case we can salvage a lot of it from junkyards since it was a
dealer accessory, but he would rather have something that is known to be
good right off the bat.

His motor is a Jake Raby built T4 2.0+ so it should have no problem running
the compressor.  Hopefully a Sanden one over the old York.


Thanks for your help!
