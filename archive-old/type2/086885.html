&gt; The Dwell meter is supposed to work on electronic ignition, so that is not a
&gt; problem. My vanagon is federal so still has the points. At some point I will

&gt; igniter II is available for my year first.

hmmmmm, most should work, I have pertronix and mine works.  now if I
recall

&gt; Yes I hooked up the black lead to ground and the green lead to the negative
&gt; side of the coil (green wire running to the distributor). This is per how the
&gt; meter is supposed to be used. The van won't start with the meter installed in

hmmm, mine has clips that go on the battery for power.  So both + &amp; - are
hooked to battery.  then a third wire is clipped to the battery, but I am
trying to remember, thought it was + side of coil but I read the
instructions every time I use it to remember

&gt; this manner. Currently have it set to RPM mode as I just want to see what the
&gt; idle speed is. As the meter works on the newer Isuzu, I think something else

right, once I put in the Pertronix teh dwell was locked on every time I
checked so I rarely check any more

&gt; strange must be going on. The van has only 49,500 original miles (I have had

or is that 149.500 or  249,500 .......

what brand of dwell meter do you have?
