Thought I would post the answers I received about the best ways to waterproof
a bus tent.

&gt; Try using a cheese grater to crumble bee's wax into warm turpentine.
Stirring
&gt; often,
&gt; the resulting mixture can be painted unto canvas to waterproof and seal the
&gt; seams.
&gt; There are probably other proprietary mixtures, but this is the one for
&gt; sealing canvas
&gt; canoes...

And someone else said to use Thompson's Water seal but that email is at work
so I don't know who it was.

Thanks to all who responded.
