Subject: RE: [T2] Pancake Virgin

Yes.  That's very common.  I have type4's come in my shop all the time with
spark plugs stuck down in there.  Magnets work great.  I have small hands
and can get a finger in there to CAREFULLY slide it close to the hole where
a long pair of needle nose pliers or those spring loaded grabber dealies can
get them out.  I have a little shelf with odds and ends parts I can't
believe people were driving on and one of those is a piece of polished
porcelain  that looks like a pearl that used to be a spark plug.  All the
rattling chipped and polished it round!!
