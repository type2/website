&gt; John,

&gt; There are several ways to go when the threads are gone. 
snip . . . 
&gt; 3. Have someone who is handy with a lathe make you studs that are 10mm in
&gt; one end and 8mm in the other. Then drill larger holes in the heads and tap
&gt; them to 10mm.
&gt; 
These &quot;step studs&quot; are sold commercially.  I believe most of the VWFLAPS
have them.  They are used for exactly this problem, when the head is
stripped.  I know I have at least one head that has them in all four
positions.
