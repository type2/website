Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Rookie Question about Valve Cover Gaskets

I now use Permatex Aviation 
&gt; form-a-gasket. 

Can I buy this at most auto parts stores?  Does it have a different name depending on where it is being sold, like Permatex Aluminum Head Form-A-Gasket?

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon

By the way, I never followed up on my Z bed, the darn thing fixed itself before I got a chance to fix it,  I don't like it when that happens, I feel like it will break again just when I need it, there was something else that I never reported back on, radio accessory maybe, I am running a wire from the RV battery through a particular type of toggle switch that only allows power through one side or the other, I think it is a DPST, or something like that, but it will allow the RV battery to power the ignition side of the radio without powering up everything in my fuse panel

I get awesome replies to my questions, I fix things, and I rarely say &quot;hey, thanks for the advice, I fixed everything up because of the help I get from this list&quot; but I get lots of great advice from the people on this list that I use so I just wanted to say thank you and just because I don't follow up doesn't mean I don't use the advice and don't appreciate it, just living the crazy modern life and rarely stopping to breath.
