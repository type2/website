Subject: Re: [T2] Trip to yosemite oil temps and a eurovan

crawled all around the rialta and a new eurovan with full package at the 
winnebago dealer.
They both looked okay to me.  There is some debate in places about the 
vehicles though.  the trick is as to who has warrantee to which part of 
the vehicle...VW or Winnebago.  Even winnebago couldnt answer some 
questions for me.  Like who is the source for the lp gas system.  They 
say it has a VW part number (NOT) and vw says its a winnebago part.
Dont know what has been done to resolve that part.

&gt; cooling the inhabitants (yeah I know drive at night etc...).
&gt; 	I also started pricing the eurovan. Anybody have any experience
