&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; On my way back down from Independence Pass (12,000ft Continental Divide) on 
&gt; Friday, I noticed something disturbing.  Whenever I went around a curve at a 
&gt; &quot;spirited&quot; speed (left or right), oil pressure would drop from the usual 
&gt; 40psi to as low as 5psi.  The oil light would go on (at pressure lower than 
&gt; 8psi), then turn off as the road straightened and oil pressure climbed back 

Low oil level can cause this.  All the oil shifts to the side leaving the
pump sucking air.  Cure is to slow down to a sane speed.  It's a bus, not
a 911!
