Yes they fit; the 40 IDF does NOT use velocity stacks.
We have the kits with a significant discount, and a jet exchange program if
you are interested.

&gt; Do 40 IDF's fit a Type 4 engined vanagon under the stock
&gt; decklid or are they too tall?  Do they require short air cleaners
&gt; and velocity stacks or anything like that?
&gt;
&gt; My enquiring mind wants to know.
