&gt; I am thinking that I might have to put the battery inside the bus. Maybe
&gt; under one of the seats? I have heard people talk about the gasses and
&gt; possible explosions, what is the lists opinions about that? The bugs all
&gt; have the battery under the seat and I see no problems with doing the same

actually the only problemm I know personally from the battery under the
seatc was when very heavy person sat in back on rough road and pushed the
seat down enough for the springs to short out the battery, they smelled
the smoke and got out and the seat out before any serious damage occured
but putting a coover on the battery as one is supposed to should avoid
that problem,  I think I would vent the battery when charging though, that
is when there is likely to be a problem.
