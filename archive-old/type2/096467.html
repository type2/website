Subject: Re: [T2] idle woes - was engine woes

Tom,

Hmmmmm...what year/engine

Fi fuel pressure regulator is a &quot;sealed&quot; unit and *not* normally 
adjustable(there &quot;are&quot; ways to do this though).

Carbed engine is usually only adjustable by changing gaskets under the 
fuel pump....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ok, I finally figured out that I had my vac lines on my dizzy backwards!  
Now, that they are in the right place, my bus does something odd.  
when I start it, it idles at about 750-900 RPM then after about 30 secs. 
it jumps up to what i am guessing 1200 RPM or Any thoughts on what would cause this?  How dependent is idle speed on vaccuum?  Could this also have something to do with the fact that I adjusted my fuel pressure regualtor?
