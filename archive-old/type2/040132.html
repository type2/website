daniel,
i think you are right in your assumption that it is an
old alarm system.   i had a 79 BMW 733 that had the
similar key lock on the front fender which puzzled me
for quite a while.   it turned out it was an ancient
alarm.   either that or &quot;Q&quot; has gotten ahold of your
bus at some point so the possibilities are endless.

&gt; Hello wonderful people,
&gt; 	Here is a strange item I hope someone has run into
&gt; in the vast experience
&gt; of the list.
&gt; 	On the nose of my new '73 westy, on the drivers
&gt; side, just to the outside
&gt; of the headlight, there is a locking mechanism.  It
&gt; is a simple key hole
&gt; that looks like it fits a smaller key, like a
&gt; locking gas cap key.  When I
&gt; pull the front panel inside, the back of this lock
&gt; looks like it has four
&gt; places to attach wiring, but there are no wires
&gt; attached.  What could this
&gt; be?  Is is a primitive security system of some kind,
&gt; maybe a battery
&gt; disconnect?  It really isn't all that important, but
&gt; my curiosity is running
&gt; wild with this.  I am just imagining really cool
&gt; James Bond type gadgets
&gt; popping up all over the bus if I actually got the
&gt; key for this thing (hey, I
&gt; can dram, right?)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
