Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Paint -it-yourselfers

FWIW there are MUCH cheaper alternatives to rattle cans at $6 a pop. My local auto paint supplier sells basic primers for $30 a gallon (I think it was). Covers MUCH better than rattle cans so there is more primer to sand on and thus quicker to get the job done. Same with paint - much better paint available by the quart and gallon for less than cases of rattle cans. some suppliers are higher than others. Seems like NAPA was higher than the auto body supplier and prob equal in quality.

As I recall the spray cans are lacquer and the gallons of paint the auto body supply sells can be lacquer (not good - lots of work to get shine, chips easily), acrylic enamel (better in the resists chipping department), or 2 stage paint - sort of an epoxy or urethane I think. 

Seems like primer was $30, and acrylic was $50 a gallon. Hardner was optional and an additional cost. Adds shine at the expense of less chipping resistance. Mine had chipped in several places. A gallon of primer and a couple gallons of paint maybe? 

Terry K. must be sitting at home gritting his teeth right now... &lt;grin!&gt; Us amateurs prob work his nerves. Hang in there Terry. 

Anyway I find the quality materials to be worth their money just like in tires. Buy the cheap stuff twice or three times and buy the good stuff once. That said I would use the cheap stuff the first few paint jobs so the learning curve is cheap!
