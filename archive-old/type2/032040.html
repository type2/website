Dear list,

Please save my ass once again.

OK I'm the guy that replaced my left side head and rings this week.
Yesterday I got it back in.  Had to drop the tranny after I just couldn't
get the splines to match up after like an hour of grunting.
While the engine was out I replaced the following:
--All pushrod tube seals
--dipstick boot
--Oil pressure switch
--points+condensor
--Fuel filter
--Changed oil
--Left side head replaced AMC with burnt exhaust valve with AVP rebuild.
--Rings on pistons 3,4
--All exhaust gaskets

I put everything back in and set the points with a feeler gauge to .016&quot;.
I checked the timing statically and my light came on at 12 degrees BDTC on
the scale when the notch hit it.  Now some say the notch is o degrees and
some say it is  5 degrees BTDC.  If it is 5 before than the timning is
about 7 BTDC-good enough for me.  If the notch is zero then my timing is
off.  How would I go about changing it if necessary?  I loosened that 10
mil bolt and the ditrib will turn 2-3 degrees only enough to change static
timing from 16 BTDC to 12 BTDC and I would want to go closer so that
wouldn't help.

Anyways--the problem is this--lurching/hesitation whatever its called.

At 15+ in first, 27 in second, 39 in 3rd 60-65 in 4th. It drives great but
when accelerating it just lurches a few times at those speeds.  It also
seems to be running hot both times I drove it with a burnt oil smell.  I
think timing is fine(see above). Dwell is 51 so thats good.  I am thinking
it might be my coil or a bad spark plug wire causing it to miss at the
higher RPMs.  I have a black Bosch coil that is all beat and looks like it
survived Vietnam.  Also on my second test drive it took 5 miunutes before
the first lurch even occured.  Is this the coil running out of juice after
a little bit?

It is now 11:20pm PST and I am posting this in hopes of leaving tomorrow
by 10 AM to drive 250+ miles to the other side of Washington State.  I
could put up with the lurching but the hot running bothers me.  Are they
related.  I plan to buy a new coil at 8 when the parts stores open and
maybe a set of wires too.  If that doesn't fix things I will take it to
the local VW place and try to get them to squeeze me in so I can still
leave on time.

Any suggestions on the coil/wires idea or other causes of the lurching?

TIA

P.S. Sorry if you get my original messages too. I know Ken Hooper said not
to repost but I saw some guys message get through and I hope you guys can
help me so I can leave on time!
