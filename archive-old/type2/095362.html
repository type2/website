Subject: RE: In-dash tunes

However, this stereo performs some gymnastic maneuvers
when the key is turned off, (kind of swallows it's face for
security reasons).

Cool.

Is it bad for the Pertronics points eliminator system to
be left on for long periods?

Yes. Don't do it. My Pertronix instructions say so.

If so, could I swap out the ignition switch with a later
model with an accessory position?

Never done a switch ... but I'm having the same CD-won't-play-at-this-angle 
problem. I'm wondering if anyone's put their gauges in the stereo hole? I'm 
thinking about doing that and I seem to remember someone on the list had it.

Mick
