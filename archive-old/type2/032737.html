Hi,

&gt;  The problem is the offset. Offset is how much a
&gt; wheel is off its center line. If you were to measure the width of the
wheel,
&gt; divide this by two, then lay a straightedge across the back edge of
the
&gt; wheel, measure from the straightedge to the face of the flange where
it
&gt; mounts to the hub, then subtract the 1/2 measurement.The difference
in mm is
&gt; the offset or ET.

&gt; The more positive offset you have, the more you are moving the
&gt; centerline to the outside. 

 This contradicts your explanation above, which I beleive to be correct.

 An increase in offset displaces the mounting face outwards, so unless
you use a shim (spacer) to fill the gap the centreline will move inwards
when you offer the mounting face up to the hub. This means that wheels 
with slightly bigger offsets (eg 44mm) can be positioned correctly by
using spacers/shims, whereas wheels with small offsets would need
major machining to position them correctly, potentially causing
all sorts of problems.

&gt; The 124 body [300E] in the late 80's/early 90's did have 6.5 x 15
wheels,
&gt; but the ET was 49.

 The ones in my garage are 7x15, with ET44. I think they are from a 124
body car as well (maybe a 300?) and have 15 holes round the rim. These
look like the rims Karl lists as &quot;Sportline&quot; for the 190, so it could 
be that they were UK specific on the 300 or just that some PO of the 
car they came off decided he liked the look of them(!).
 I have some 3mm spacers to correct the offset. I have some 60mm studs 
for the rear hubs and am currently trying to source 70mm ones for the
fronts.
 I am led to believe that the stock rear studs are 35mm and the front
ones are 45mm. I have a rear stud  that I bought from VW to check the
sizing and it fits this assertion. I havn't had the front hubs to bits
yet to check them out. With my wheels having 22mm faces and accounting
for the 3mm spacers this makes the 60mm stud exactly right at the rear,
but 10mm too short at the front.

 Be warned that long studs are hard to find: they use a 14x1.5mm 
thread, btw.

 I'm still looking for confirmation of the stock wheel's offset, BTW.
My Haynes manual says 41mm, but Brian Verbeek says 39mm.

Cheers,
	W.
