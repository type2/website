Subject: 1600 DP valve adjustment

I have a bit over 6K on my rebuilt 1600 DP. Adjusted the valves myself
for the first time (previously done by a mechanic), as per the Bentley
manual. No problem following the procedure, my question is that now the
engine sounds &quot;tickier&quot;. Is this normal? A couple of the valves were too
tight to fit my .006 gauge, the manual says to adjust till you feel a
&quot;moderate&quot; drag on the gauge, which I did...could what I perceive to be
moderate drag be  too little drag? As I understand it, valves tend to
tighten up over time, so would the valves being a tad lose cause a
problem? Took a test drive after the adjustment, runs great, power is
good, etc....probably just a bit paranoid on my part, but I want to make
sure I'm not going to hurt anything.  TIA
