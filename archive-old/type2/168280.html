&gt; news is reporting that a local pick and pull, CRazy Ray's a favorite
&gt; of many bus pilots in the mid atlantic area, just had a car fall on
&gt; one of their patrons.  the fire dept was able to free the person with
&gt; no serious injuries but lets all remember these things we play with
&gt; are big and heavy and can hurt us if were not carefull.

Call me sick, but the first thing that came to mind was that episode of The
Simpson's when all the kids get video camera to tape a school project. It's
the scene when Bart tried to kick over the jacked up car so it falls on
Homer and can't get it to tip. He then says &quot;Who knew you could hold up a
car with a wicker basket!&quot;
