Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

Fitted an Alpine CD/radio to our 76.  Yes, you have to enlarge the  
hole to accept the modern cages that fit into the dash to accept the  
unit itself.  Took awhile, had to cut the corners with tin snips &amp;amp;  
then carefully fold the edges in to accommodate the cage.  Worth the  
work though, as the unit is then easily removed if needed.
One thing, tried to mount the rear support for the unit onto the rear  
of the ashtray.  Spent hours getting it to fit &amp;amp; then found that it  
was a real pain to remove/refit the unit so left it off.  Haven't had  
any trouble in 12,000 km.
