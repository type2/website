Subject: Re: [T2] temp head sensor #2
References: &lt;002101c0c042$e832ed00$09e47018_at_pr1.on.wave.home_dot_com&gt;

The cyl head temp sensor is a temperature dependent variable resistor
whose role governs startup to warmup mixture-Based on Bentley, the
resistance across the sensor at 68 degrees is 2500 ohms.  Don't forget
that in the 77, you have another temp semsor in the AFM that should be
checked a la Bentley.  Take your sensor and ohmeter and probe between
the disconnected lead and ground and it should read near this.  I can't
remember, but know that as temp rises or lowers from 68 deg, the
resistance will change proportionally -not sure if it's inverse- you can
get readings of a hot engine from a friend or take your sensor and apply
heat or stick it in the freezer to see what it does.  Yes you could get
a variable resistor at Radio Shack and duplicate the readings if you had
a meter across the leads, or you could solder in a rotary switch that
selects resistors.  Makes more sense to see if the head can be retapped
for an insert like a helicoil.  I suppose you could try JB weld to
reinsert the sensor, but a wiser person on the list could say if you
need a good ground for the base of the sensor that the JB weld epoxy may
compromise.

&gt; I have a '77 bus that is failing to run right now. It starts but runs
&gt; erratic and is pushing alot of white smoke. The engine is a GD motor, 2.0L
&gt; Fuel Infected with about 165,000 miles. I suspected the sensor was bad
&gt; because it was getting no voltage at dead cold or even hot. (assuming that
&gt; it works when the head gets hot?)
&gt; 
&gt; So I removed it. I have tried desperately to put in a replacement but I cant
&gt; get the sensor to thread in. I am afraid the soft heads may be stripped, it
&gt; was a bitch to get the old sensor out.
&gt; 
&gt; So after a brief chat with Jamie Rivers about her condition, the synptoms of
&gt; the engine lead to running rich, due to the sensor being 'missing' from the
&gt; engine. BUT, I cant get a new sensor in. SO....
&gt; 
&gt; Question: Is there a way to bypass this sensor and trick the engine or is
&gt; that sensor 100% critical to a running FI motor. I tried to apply 12 volts
&gt; to the wire and 'trick it' but it stalls out...
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas or do I pull the motor and re-thread the sensor hole and fix all
&gt; the other little things I had meant to do? (new exhaust seals, muffler, push
&gt; tod tube seals)
