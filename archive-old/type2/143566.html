Subject: Re: [VB] why so many different exhausts?

Hi John&amp;Olive,
There are many exhausts because the aftermarket muffler makes for VW cater  
to the &quot;Make your VW faster, more HP, and sound/look kewl!!!&quot;
  If you are going to drag race your upright engined (pre-1972 here in  N. 
America) bus or run an engine bigger than a 1776cc, you could use the  bigger 
badder exhaust for more flow.  The problem with more flow in the  exhaust is it 
actually sucks out fuel going into the cylinders when  both the intake and 
exhaust valves are open at the same time.  Plus with  high flow while one can get 
more HP at much higher RPMs, torque which is best  for a bus in the low RPMs 
is much lessened.
  If you are not going to drag race and/or much bigger  engine.  Want quiet, 
more MPG due to proper stock back pressure,  and have max road clearance.  
Then a stock muffler is the way to  go.
  Additionally the aftermarket mufflers only tend to last about 3  years up 
here.  With a stock muffler you can get at least five  years.
 
  We recently removed the 1641cc SP CW engine with stock  muffler from our 
1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  It has been  over 60,000 on the rebuild 
so figured on giving it a good look over.   Stripped the engine to a long 
block and checked engine studs/nuts/bolts for  proper torque (had check this at 
40,000 miles), and found all these to be still  properly torqued.  Used to be 
with earlier engines of our's,  we found at only 20,000 miles these to be less 
than 25% of proper  torque!  
  Did fix a lot of other fixes of little  piddly problems.  Especially the 
small exhaust leaks where the  heat exchangers seal to the muffler, and made 
sure all flange sealing areas were  flat.  The pipes that comes out of the rear 
of the heat exchangers had  rusted to the point that no matter how much one 
tightened the exhaust seal  clamps they still leaked a bit.  So got 1-3/8&quot; OD 
pipe that was a snug fit  in the exhaust donuts, cut off the old HE outlet pipes, 
welded on the new ends,  and they sealed right up.
  First thing we noticed was the engine ran on, after we shut it off,  a sure 
sign that the pilot jet was now too big for the engine!!  The better  sealing 
of the HEs to the muffler is the only explanation is less fuel was  being 
sucked out of the cylinders.  Experimented with smaller pilot jets  and found out 
we could use a smaller one, and the running on went away!   Should get better 
MPG now.
