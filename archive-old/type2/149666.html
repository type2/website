Subject: Vacuum hose hunt

I've been looking high and low for a piece of hose that will work to span the
gap between the decel valve and the plastic pipe that fits into the rubber Y
fitting at the intake plenum. This is for my 80 Vanagon. Tried using some 1/2
inch fuel line but it is quickly developing cracks at the ends that are
streached over the tubes at each end. I've checked Bus Depot ( couldn't find
it) and Bus Boys (NLA) with no luck. The tubes the hose has to fit over
measure 9/16 inch. Locally I can only find 1/2 inch (Too small) and 19/32 (too
big).

Does anyone know where I can find a suitable hose?
