Ok, I took Zeke out for a spin around the block yesterday, I was getting =
alot of backfiring.  Some at idle, alot on decel.  I have replaced =
points, plugs, cap, rotor, wires.  Adjusted valves, dwell, timing.  My =
timing is set to 5ATDC.  Just can not figure it out.  The only thing i =
have not done is synch the carbs.  I have the rebuild kits for my carbs =
and perhaps it's time to rebuild? Any suggestions would be great
