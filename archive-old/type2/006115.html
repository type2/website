I have a 1979 bus with a 1600 upright in it.  I've never worked on a pancake
engine, but they look not-so-friendly as an upright.  A PO did my conversion
and it still doesn't have all its cooling tin.  I'm trying to get the tin
presently.  The transmission for the pancake is not the same as for an
upright.  The transmission shaft of mine and the first four inches of the
inside of the bell have been grinded down.  Recently I had to modify my new
throw out bearing guide so that it wouldn't push on the pressure plate.  Now
I'm afraid that I cut it too short because my throw out bearing is making
all kinds of growling noises at me.  If I was into doing this right I would
get a transmission that went with an upright.  But I'd rather spend my free
time tinkering with it.  Good luck.

Christopher
