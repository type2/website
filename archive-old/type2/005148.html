Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found One

I finally was able to see the type 4 engine I've been asking questions
about.  Turns out it's a 2.0 from a 76 bus.  It's all complete except for
the muffler.  It's definetly going to need to be rebuilt but I didn't have
anything at all past the tranny in my 73 so it should give me something to
work with.  I also ended up bringing home the 76 bus minus tranny and a 69
sunroof bus minus the engine.

Do you think it's best to go with a smaller clutch and bellhousing on the
2.0 to fit inside my 73 bellhousing or should I look for a later bellhousing
and starter?

John
