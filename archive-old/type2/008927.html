&gt; &gt; Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to
&gt; get a seal
&gt; &gt; for that? And how tough is it to install?

&gt; Sunroof: My experience is that if a sunroof leaks it's because the
&gt; drain
&gt; tubes are plugged. There are 4 drain tubes -one at each corner of the
&gt; opening- and they tend to fill up with mud and organic material and
&gt; get
&gt; plugged. I've never unplugged the ones on my 82, but have on a
&gt; beetle.
&gt; I'd use a piece of solid insulated #12 electrical wire 6 or 7 feet
&gt; long
&gt; and just gently ream out the holes. I do worry about pushing off the
&gt; drain tubes from their attaching points in the body metal and the way
&gt; to
&gt; avoid this would be to snake the cleaning tool up from the underside
&gt; thru the hoses. 
&gt; Does anyone on the list have more type 2 experience on this?
&gt; It helped on my 67 beetle which is similar.

I have owned 3 sunroof busses and the late 73-up have a better system
then the pre-73. I have looked for the seals and have had little luck,
I did find one for $400, but just laughed at the guy. I then got a
pop-top from a Westy and solved the problem. You must clean the drains
or it will leak. The 68-71(or 72) have a long tube that extends into
the engine comp. and it is next to imposible to clean, the latter bus
had a short tube that can be cleaned from the engine intake vent holes.
