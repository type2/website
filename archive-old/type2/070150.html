Subject: GEX Update and misc

I picked up the Westy today. The engine has never ever been this quiet.
Before you run out and buy GEX engine parts, let me explain what the
mechanic had to do to get the van up and running.

First I deliver the heads to him. On re-assembly, a spark plug gets
jammed in no. 2 and then in no. 4. He says send the heads back. Determined
to salvage our summer camping plans, I say try
and get the plug out without breaking it, then ream the hole with a thread
chaser. He does. He breaks his thread chaser. The plug does not break but  the
threads are shot. Both
heads go out to have helicoils put into them. A weekend passes. The
engine is fixed. Turns out that the plug threads were in  bad shape to
begin with GEX up to its tricks again?

So the engine is re-assembled, but the gasket set GEX sent &quot;gratis&quot; has the
wrong size gaskets for the pushrod tubes. Additional time and cost. 

OK
David Schwarze you can stop laughing now.

Actually the engine has never run better. It is running a bit rich though.
Has anyone had any experience adjusting a flow meter? I think the
spring can be wound a tad tighter to get CO down to 1.1 percent. 


I will keep you posted on the outcome of all this.


Cheers - DC
