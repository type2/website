&gt; I don't know a way of safely removing these... especially if someone used the 
&gt; &quot;more permanent&quot; type of loctite... we had this problem at work, and could 
&gt; *not* remove the grade 5 bolt come hell or high water... turns out someone 
&gt; used the &quot;studlocker&quot; version (green in a little tube).  I *did* find out, 
&gt; tho, that you can shear the bolt head off on one of these given enough 
&gt; persuasion.

Since Loctite is a plastic of sorts, could it be softened by heating?
Apply the &quot;blue wrench&quot; to it, get it good and warm, and then remove the
screws?
