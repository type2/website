Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge calibration

Thanks Dave and everyone else,

The sender was installed by my mechanic so I am assuming that he did
calibrate the sender. I'll dig into my instrument cluster and check back
there to make sure everything looks good.

&gt; Guys,
&gt;
&gt; I got another 1/8 tank on a new fuel sender gauge by pulling the
&gt; instrument cluster and tightening the two nuts on the gauge end slightly
&gt; and reseating anc checking all of my grounds on the instrument cluster.
&gt;
&gt; I had two ground wires that were loose and when I tried to bend the tabs
&gt; slightly, both broke...replaced tham and all was fine.
&gt;
&gt; Haven't filled up yet again, but symptoms sound the same as me....and I
&gt; *did* adjust the sender before installing it!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
