  me!!!!)

Hello Mark,

You said that this is a fuel injected engine, right?
Some times a back fire can cause one of the elbows in
the vacuum lines to pop off. THis will cause a
dramatic loss in engine vacuum and your engine will
not start when shut off and it will not idle if you do
get it to run. check every vacuum hose connection
especially the one on the decel valve. reconnect the
elbow and you should be in business. This is one
reason that VW did NOT put hose clamps on every vacuum
hose connection. In case of a back fire, it just blows
off a vacuum hose rather than destory your AFM.  It
also sounds like you have a CV problem as well. The
back fire that blew off one of the hoses may have been
the straw on the camel's back that cauesd enough of a
jolt to mess up your cv. I had an axle come off with
the same symptoms after all of the bolts except one
backed out. A bump in the road caused the last bolt to
shear and I immedately lost all power but the engine
still ran. Any way, Good Luck!

Regards,
David Kelly
