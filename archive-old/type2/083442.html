I'm not too sure this is correct bob. Section 5 page 49 of my bentley
says this:
note: &lt;excess stuff removed&gt; The oil seal must be seated squarely in
the crankcase recess

From this i take it that seated means all the way to the back of the
lip. Now bentley doesn't say one way or the other &quot;all the way till
bottoming out&quot; but I have always considered seated to mean that.
Anyone have any comments?
