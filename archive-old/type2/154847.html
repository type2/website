Subject: Re: [T2] Really long RCA cable for Type2

It was important to me to have a good, tough, shielded cable, and I wanted it right away, no ordering.
A friend told me I could use 2 subwoofer lines and that they come in very long lengths, I went to Best Buy and bought 2) 25' Aucoustic Research subwoofer connection lines, one was tagged as previously opened and was marked down 6 bucks, so I got them both for 40 bucks, way under my budget.
A 25' unshilded interconnect could act like a 25' antennae, in my opinion.
Thanks for the responses.
Sunday I am having a XO built with my new speakers mounted in my bus so that I have a flat frequncy response, very exciting.
Thank you,
James in Portland, Oregon
