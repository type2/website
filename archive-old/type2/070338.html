Subject: Dead Stickers = Probable Cause ?!?

I broke down in my '72 on I-95 in Virginia a few years ago.  A state 
trooper pulled up behind me after only a few minutes.  My aftermarket 
electric fuel pump have given out so he radioed for a tow truck.

While we were waiting for the tow truck, the trouble started.  &quot;Did you 
put those stickers on this vehicle?&quot; (duh!), &quot;Where are you headed?&quot;, 
&quot;Where are you from?&quot;.

I answered all of his questions politely, including his last question: 
&quot;May I search your vehicle.&quot;  My answer was NO, of course - and he left 
us alone.

Perhaps he could have searched us if he had really wanted to but I 
suspect that stickers are NOT probable cause (at least in VA).  Maybe 
things would have been different if he had pulled me over for speeding 
or something instead of happening upon a disabled vehicle.

Needless to say, I have fewer stickers now.  :-(
