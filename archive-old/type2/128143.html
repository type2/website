Subject: Re: [T2] Physics of towing

&gt; While driving around Glacier National Park this week, I had reason to
&gt; reflect on a persistent FART on this list: towing. That got me thinking
&gt; about the physics of towing, and whether the gasoline required for one
&gt; vehicle to tow another vehicle would be more or less than the gasoline
&gt; required for the same two vehicles to travel under their own power. It
&gt; seems to me that, counterintuitive as it might seem, it would require
&gt; less total gasoline to operate two vehicle separately.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, all I am taking into account is the total mass of two
&gt; vehicles driven by one engine, versus the same mass driven by two
&gt; engines. It could be that there are efficiencies in towing that I am
&gt; not taking into account.
&gt;
&gt; Let me simplify the problem by talking specifics. Which would use more
&gt; gasoline: a bus towing a bug? Or a bus and a bug traveling the same
&gt; distance, under the same conditions, but separately? And why?

Most of the energy the engine produces is consumed in pushing air aside.
When towing, the air only has to be pushed aside once.  When driving
separately, the air has to be pushed aside twice.

An engine requires a certain amount of energy to simply keep itself
turning.  Two engines would require twice the amount of energy to spin as
one.

For both of these reasons, it is usually more economical to tow one car
with another than it is to drive both cars separately.
