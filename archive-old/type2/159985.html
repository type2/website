Subject: Re: [T2] Pulsing brake pedal problem ?

&gt; Just been through a lengthy process to fit albatross adjusters to my
&gt; '71.  Dropped the rear one spline and the front accordingly.  Bus has
&gt; factory servo brakes as it's from the US and brakes were perfect before
&gt; job.
&gt;
&gt; Now the pedal pulses a bit when I brake, less obvious if I stand on the
&gt; brakes.  What swrong ????
&gt;
An ol' 71 I had pulsed or at least sent some vibrations back thru' the
brake pedal...It was the first sign of a front beam that was internally
rusted at the shock/damper mount uprights...Any movement in the
beam will transmit thru' the master cylinder to the pedal...It's a long
shot but something to check out...
