hi all!

I have a '71 camper without the optional headrests for the front seats and am
planning a mamouth six month road trip. No matter how nice the original seats
are, they kinda make the butt ache after a while and I dont fancy jousting the
roads of europe without some kind of head restraint either.

can anybody suggest a good replacement i can get from a car scrapyard that
fits nicely (I cant lose any legroom), and has anyone done this without
resorting to welding?  In the last resort has anyone fitted their own to the
bulkheads behind the front seats?

any help much appreciated,  adam
