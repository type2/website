&gt;The package was from an
&gt;online retailer, the package had their logo on the box and as part of
&gt;the return address sticker, yet they had declared it as a &quot;gift&quot; with
&gt;a $20 value.  It was worth quite a bit more and it didn't take much
&gt;for customs to go to the retailer's website to find out how much more.

That's a classic undervalued item capture.

I'm not sure what CCRA does to US vendors who abuse the gift category: I suspected from the vendor comments, they may have all their packages blocked yet it's revenue for the goverment so why would they...
