Well, what the heck:

'71 Westy  (w/ 2 kids cots, three rear hatch screens!, stool, 
             &amp; a just twist of bondo, rust, dings and dents)

Interesting statistic:   
   I've calculated the cost per mile on my baby, and so far I could  have
gotten by cheaper by taking a cab! 

Good thing I have the indestructable $40 beater T*y*ta...
