Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??

[...]

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; I'm new to this list and new to type 2's in general. I purchased one about a
&gt; month ago and have been struggleing with poor performance since. It is a '75
&gt; Westy. Could someone please comfirm I'm on the right track...When I bought
&gt; it the timing was 12 BTDC, according to Muir it should be 7.5 ATDC but when
&gt; I set it at that my milage and power was horrible. As I advance it the van
&gt; runs better but never great. Rght now it is back at 12 BTDC. When I move the
&gt; points and plug the hole on the diaphram they move back to their original
&gt; position...does this mean the diaphram is broken?? I just wanted to get a
&gt; second opinion before I replaced the distributor.

You are sort of on the right track.
You should have a dual vacuum unit dist, correct?
Moving the breaker plate and capping the nipple on the advance unit is not a
very good test. You may be moving the plate the wrong way and capping the
wrong nipple.
Not sure where Muir came up with 7.5 after. No fuel injected 1800 [ED engine]
ever timed at that number. The correct figure is 5 after. BUT this is only if
the retard side has vacuum and it is at idle.
DOES the inboard pointing hose have vacuum at idle?
If no, trace the hose back and find out why.
If yes, does the timing change when you disconnect it at idle?
If no, then you have a bad vacuum unit.
