Subject: .009 and the Weber Progressive


A lot of you know about and have helped me on swapping my old 1700 in my '72
for a rebuilt 2 liter AVP engine.  I have learned a lot, but (pat me on the
back as I cry)  have had a heck of a time with it and this is the 6th week
of not having a vehicle to drive.

I have listened to all the advice from the type2 list and bought the 2 liter
instead of a 1700 and had them put in hydraulic lifters (although not all
recommend this). I have replaced my .009 dizzy with a new vacum advance unit
and replaced my single Weber progressive with some used, dual Weber 40 IDF
carbs.

My first problem occured because I was sold the wrong flywheel, which meant
2 engine pulls. Now that I finally got the engine back in and together (by
myself!!) I was having a devil of a time with the timing and the engine just
didn't run good. Lots of backfiring and NO power.

Well I have given up and taken the bus to my mechanic. Ernie is a guy with
30 yrs experience and works on all foreign cars. I have seen buses there
before and he has done a pretty good job in the past for me. The first thing
he tells me is that the compression on the right side of the engine is only
90 lbs. (I do have a compression tester, but didn't think to check it). I am
really worried about that, but he called just now and it turns out the right
hand carb is messed up. Ernie says the right side of the engine wasn't
getting any gas. Whoever worked on it last cracked the emulsion tube and the
jet was messed up. He is trying to find the tube for me and some other stuff
for the carrb to get it running right. I am hoping that maybe since the
right side wasn't getting any gas that the compression will come up some
after running a bit. I have heard that the hyd. lifters need to be
pressurized. If not 90 lbs is not good for a rebuilt engine and I may be
looking at a battle with AVP.

I hope Ernie can fix my carb and get the engine running next week before
Everybus. But here is the question I have:

Ernie wanted to know why I wanted to use that &quot;old vacum advance&quot; dizzy when
I have a good .009. He also said I should have kept the Weber progressive
and that the dual IDF's will just give me trouble. Ernie doesn't have a
computer. He doesn't get online and doesn't know what the type2 list is. I
try to explain to him that the list says the 009 is bad and  the single
Weber worse. Can you guys explain why this is so I can print it out for him
to read. I thought I knew, but trying to explain it to him I felt like a
fool.   :0)
