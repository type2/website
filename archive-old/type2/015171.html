&gt;ok...
&gt;I have a 6V gas heater...SW
&gt;when I hook it up to juice, the blower for the heat spins...no problems...
&gt;but the gas pump blower doesn't...
&gt;when I hook up the gas pump to 6V by itself, it works dandy.
&gt;but only when hooked up by itself.  my thinking is that it is the little 
&gt;resistor or something like that where the heat comes out.  2 red wires 
&gt;connect to it and a screw goes through it mounting it to the sheet metal.  
&gt;Can I just hook these 2 wires together and all will be fine? or do I need a 
&gt;new little ceramic (or whatever it is...its white with a covering on it and 
&gt;2 wires soldered on it) part...or can I just hook these 2 wires together?

Try:

JB Heater Service
2162 Vinyard
Castle Rock, CO  80104

(303) 660-9032

JB also has an SW service manual he sells for $6.00 (I think).  He has
always had a good stash of used units and parts when he's worked on my
stuff.  YMMV, I'm just a happy customer.  He's a VW/gas heater specialist
and a little cranky at times but knows his stuff!

Good luck,
Craig in CO
