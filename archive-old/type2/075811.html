Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand from Bus Depot , follow up, help needed

Woops,
Here is a link to some more picture of the engine stand arm.

It's only set in place. I would pull the lower stud and replace it with a
bolt. I also noticed you may need to grind a little off the bracket on the
bottom to get it to seat flat against the case.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; well, i was able to get that bracket attached by
&gt; putting a long screwdriver through both holes and
&gt; forcing them to line up, then had to hit the screw
&gt; through with a hammer. it worked, and seems to be all
&gt; good, but i'm still annoyed that i had to do it at
&gt; all. i bought the engine stand to help with a project,
&gt; not because i wanted a project. i dont think i'll be
&gt; giving EMPI anymore dead presidents.( whats up with VW
&gt; parts &quot;made in china&quot; anyway!?)
&gt;
&gt; i would still like input as to how the Type IV engine
&gt; bolts onto this stand. if anyone has a picture of this
&gt; stand with a Type IV engine on it that they could send
&gt; that would be good too. thanks a lot.

&gt; this email.
