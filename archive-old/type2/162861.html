Subject: Re: [T2] Whistling Bus - The new guy finally fixed his own bus

&gt;Whisty the Westy?  Too cheesy?

	Whistlin' Rufus?  -  esp if bus already red  -  and you could 
play the rather charmingly innocent 1950s pop tune of that title thru 
modifying one of those Italian air-horn sets, original tune 'Col. 
Bogey'.  But that would be vandalism, so just get a Philips cassette 
and amp out Whistlin' Rufus thru the 12&quot; speaker hidden in the 
bullbar-mounted spare wheel cover.
	Weird are the ways of the cult of the automobile.
