Subject: white smoke

hey there,

just wondering what you all think.  I have a 1600 dualport with about 40,000 
miles on it.  I've had the engine since it was new.  every 1500 we do oil 
and valves.  it runs great.  takes 45 up good size grades.

When we start it we get white smoke out the tailpipe.  This only happens 
when we give it gas.  when idling to warm up it doesn't smoke.  after it 
warms up the smoke goes away.

Is this normal?  is it raw fuel?

PS:  In Search of a tent for 71 camper.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
