Subject: Re: [T2] Date of manufacture stamp?

It was probably replaced. At Mercedes, we get parts
for a 10 year car that has a production date of a year
ago on it.

And then there was the secret!
replace-the-heater-boxes-because-of-asbestos episode
about 6 or 7 years ago!

 Hey everybody. Has anyone else noticed that various
 VW parts have a little circle stamped on them
 somewhere? The circle has a line in the middle with
 numbers in both halves. I am pretty sure this stamp
 is to indicate the month and year of manufacture of
 the part. The wheels that came off my old 72 had
 11/71 stamped on them, as does the oil cooler.
 
 The reason I ask is that one of the date stamps has
 me scratching my head. The left side heat exchanger
 is stamped 9/71, which is right for the 72 model
 year. However, the right side HE is stamped 6/75.
 I'm confused because I thought I knew that the whole
 exhaust system was redone for the 74 model year.
 Both of these HE's were on the old 72 when I got it,
 and the right one looks identical to every picture I
 have seen of 72-74 HE's.
