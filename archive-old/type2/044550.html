&gt; I installed the Hella dual battery kit exactly as per instructions, and it

Is this fuse in the hot wire to the aux battery?  If the aux battery is
discharged and the alternator putting out like it should, then the wire
could see more than 15A.  I'd suggest a 30A fuse if the wire is 10ga or
better.  Even better, there are circuit breakers that come in small
packages that will reset themselves if tripped.
