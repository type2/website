&gt; Last Thursday, when I was driving &quot;Bess the Bus&quot;, a sound from the engine 
&gt; came forth.  It sounded like all a boulder was rumbling in the 
&gt; engine.  Another way to describe it is, it sounded like a LOUD aluminum can 
&gt; be crushed in the engine.  I did not feel any loss of power and  at 
&gt; mid-range RPM's the noise went away.  I opened up the Muir book to 
&gt; investigate and it sounds like I am lucky I made it home.  I was only about 
&gt; 8 miles from home when I heard the noise.  BTW, when I got home there was 
&gt; no black smoke or awful smell.

get the Bentley book the Muir book is mostly based on the upright engine,
you have a type IV pancake engine.

&gt; On page 237 of my edition of the Muir book it states that I have &quot;rod 
&gt; knock&quot;.  I called the Bus Boys today (BTW, I think they are very helpful, 
&gt; Bus Depot too, just my two cents) and the gentleman guessed that it might 
&gt; be a blown valve seat.  So I am in for my first engine pull I think.

?? BTDT, blown valve seats cause much worse problems but one way to check
valve seat is to pull the valve covers, take off the rocker assembly and
see if any off the valve ends stick up further than the others, (top
center of the spring assembly)

&gt; My question is, does anyone have any suggestions on what to look for?
&gt; While the engine is out, does anyone have any recommendations on what 
&gt; should be replaced?
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased Bess in Sept and she came with a library of receipts.  Looking 
&gt; though them, Bess had new heads put in last year but the labor notes state 
&gt; this &quot;intake valves are sunken into the head, seats feel tight but appear 
&gt; to be moving in the head&quot;.  The $2900 repair bill states that the shop 
&gt; replaced the heads but not the valve assemblies.  Does that sound 
&gt; right?  Maybe this is the problem.

new heads would include new valve seats and usually new or replaced valves
and guides.   so I would suspect you got new valve assemblies.  (wow, I
paid about $2,500 to have my engine completely rebuilt by a known skilled
craftsman, of course I pulled and stripped the engine and replaced it
myself)

&gt; I have about $450 dollars to start fixing Bess and pull the engine.  Can 
&gt; anyone guess if that will be enough money?  I would hate to pull the engine 

I would reccomend you spend about $250 of that money on some decent tools,
jack and jack stands and a Bentley manual, you can get decent heads for
under $200 

&gt; and discover I am going to need more money then I have, I would rather 

you always need more money than you have ;8*{

&gt; leave her in the garage until I raise the funds.

you need to get her back on the road, 

&gt; no smoke when the noise started, no apparent loss of power, but I drive it 
&gt; like a baby.
&gt; there was plenty of oil in it when I got home
&gt; no red/green or other lights went on when the noise started.
&gt; Bess made the noise all the way home unless I was at midrange RPM's

sure doesn't sound like a head problem to me, but I have been wrong
before.   how many miles on this engine??

like another poster said, I would check other things first, heck if the
engine is running can you go to the back and hear where the noise is
coming from??

where are you located?

good luck
Bob
