Hello again, all! It's Monday-Mona-Day once more and today we attempt our
timing procedure with a new timing light.
My confusion is this: when I opened up the dist. and moved the engine until
the rotor was &quot;almost at the line in the rim&quot;, it appeared that TDC was not
yet at the line in the case, in fact, could have been construed as about 5'
BTDC. And from looking at the timing chart in Muir's book, I see it's to be
set at 5'ATDC, if I'm reading this right. Since I've never used a timing
light, I'm hoping the confusion can be attributed to my Naked Eye
Summation...but your thoughts'd be appreciated.
Also, I'm to adjust the idle speed to spec's and then check it with my
tach/dwell meter, but I can't find *how* to check the idle speed using the
meter! I changed the speed by simply turning that big ole fuel screw, right?
And I was thinking it was set too low since 'Mona would just barely idle even
after warm up.
Also (Sorry for the multitude of questions, but one thing does lead to
another!), before she had a top=end rebuild about a year and 1/2 ago, her auto
choke worked just fine. Now it doesn't appear to engage at all even though it
doesn't look to have been tampered with. How do I check it? (Muir will only
tell me how to kill it :)
Ok, well, I'll stop here and see what we get!
Thanks, thanks, and thanks again, all*
