Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Gasoline Storage

-&gt;Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for how to safely store / keep a
&gt;little gas container with their bus.  I currently have a 1 gallon plastic
&gt;can, but I'm not comfortable leaving it in the bus.  Not too sure about the
&gt;emergency fuel additives.  I was thinking of putting the entire can of gas
&gt;inside a 2 gallon ziploc bag.  How long can fuel sit, and how much heat can
&gt;it endure?
&gt;
&gt;I recently came across this stuff which sells for about $7.00 a gallon
which claims to be a safe gas substitute when poured into an empty tank but
with the engine still hot.  The literature claims it won't explode like
gasoline when stored.  Haven't tried it yet
