Subject: Re: T2: Oily To Rise

&gt;Lots of people run
&gt;lighter oil in cold weather. Those 2 minutes at startup when you have no
oil
&gt;flowing account for 90% of your engine's wear, so they say. What about 0W50
&gt;or 5W50 synthetic? Tom

I've always heard that one about the greatest wear on an engine happening
during the first few minutes and it goes to the heart of the question.
During the winter we use lighter oils to make starting easier, right? But
are there negative effects of having that lighter weight oil in the
crankcase after the engine has reached operating temperature?

Here's my reasoning: Under operating load conditions the internal engine
temps are going to be relatively constant regardless of the external air
temperature, so if we need to run a heavier oil in the summer to cool and
lubricate our engines, shouldn't we also need that same protection in the
winter? Also, does the alleged wear at startup do more damage than the wear
caused by extended operation with a light weight oil?

Any theories, ideas, two bit opinions?

Dave
