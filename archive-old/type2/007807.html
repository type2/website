Subject: More Parts that Fail
Mime-Version: 1.0

To add to things that have failed-

1. Mice nest in body brace behind engine and it rots thru from inside.
Lots of other places they can nest and ruin, like poptop canvas!
2. Housing for swing lever bushing on front axle rots out from inside and
gives you 60   degr. of stering play suddenly.
3. Westy bed hardware misaligns and you CAN'T lift bed, click, and push to
make seat- you must lift the rear of bed up first as you push!
4. Those plastic triangles on each side of front seats loosen and get  lost.
5. Let the gas attendant shove those &quot;pollution catcher&quot; nozzles into the
filler opening and crack the angled rubber inlet pipe.   You must angle
the pump tip DOWN!
6. Westy louvre window gets lotsa of play due to driving with them open.
7. Sliding door sagas as bottom roller wears thru shelf it rides on (due to
 lack of grease).
8. Late model (77 on?) loaf leaks cold air into van thru &quot;closed&quot; fresh air
 flaps   because they got cheap and tandemed one flap of the pulled one  by
a  little plastic coupler that cracks!
9. Wipers quit because steel shaft in plastic gear of motor housing cracks
the plastic if blades are held by ice.
10.The plastic knob over vent window lock comes off; can't be fixed!
