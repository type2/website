Subject: Removing the distributor drive pinion

I am awaiting the delivery of a Mexican longblock.  The engine 
compartment and the tinware is clean enough to eat off of.

I was afraid that I would have to tear the old block down (I really 
should anyway to confirm my suspicions of a broken crankshaft) just to 
get the distributor drive pinion out.

I jammed a pencil down into the hole and tried to pull it out that way. 
  After several attempts at pulling and twisting and the pencil losing 
its purchase, I went inside and had another beer.

I pulled a circlip pliers out of the toolbox.  I had bought these while 
repacking my CV joints because needlenose pilers weren't cutting it and 
the circlip had flown across the garage for the last time.  I poked 
them down into the hole, opened them up inside the (offset) notch by 
squeezing the handle, and voila!  It came out on the first try.  I then 
reached down into the bottom of the hole the pinion came out of with a 
magnet to get the two washers out.  Now the spring, pinion and washers 
are shiny clean in a baggy waiting...

Waiting...

Lurch should be back on the road by next year.   :-)
