Subject: Re: Axle Nut

Since nobody else has posted this, I will have to get off my butt and save
newbies from buying an expensive socket and breaker bar.  The way to save money
and do rear axle nuts off and on for the owner is the tool available in most vw
parts shops that is just a very heavy gauge piece of forged metal with the nut
hole in it and a dogleg about eight inches out to bang with a sledge hammer on
the thing.  Any 46 mm socket you buy will cost much more and assumes you have a
big breaker bar.  It is likely you will not use it more than once every three
years, so you could rent those things (hassle city) or about $10 you buy this
tool (yes you will need it again someday, you have the buses that last forever
but have a tendency to require attention on those back drums) and use a sledge
hammer.  You can justify buying one of those on rational, non-vw grounds or
borrow one from the nearest neighbor.

We long-term bus home mechanics already have this socket to do the flywheel nut
on the motor, it's the same size at least for all type I/II motors up to 1971.
If you know someday you will want to change a flywheel, buy the socket and a
breaker bar and don't try to just adapt the size down to a smaller drive bar, it
will break.
