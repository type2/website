Around Thanksgiving time I was not able to post a message up on
the Type2 list.  Last week it seemed to work ok.  Here goes

&gt; Are there any SoCal listees heading for BBB-V on Friday the 19th?

I went last year and the year before that too.  There were
many Type2 list subscribers.

&gt; I'll was thinking of hitting the10/15 junction around 10:30AM-ish. I'll have
&gt; the portable CB on channel 4, per chance you pass me, and have a CB. Please
&gt; P-Mail. Perhaps a carabus?

The past two years I rode hwy 62 to BBB.  It's a 2-lane hwy in
good repair, away from the Interstate and few services.   In '99 I
took a side trip out to Amboy crater and nearly shook my bus to
pieces on the very rough road out to the cinder cone.

I have that Friday off work and was planning on leaving here around
5 or 6AM.  Maybe take another side trip out in the desert along the
way again.  But plans can change if there is a convoy from L.A. to
the river in the works.  Any other L.A. bus people heading to BBB?
