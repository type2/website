&gt; &gt; as far as I know all parts are still avaliable.

&gt; Except, alas, the stainless muffler. We do have very high quality OEM
&gt; mufflers in mild steel (MUCH more substantial than any of the aftermarket
&gt; extractor systems), but the manufacturer of the stainless ones went
&gt; belly-up.


bummer, maybe they were selling it too cheap, only concern I have with
mine is that the flanges where it bolts up is not stainless and is rusting
a bit.  other than changing color (normal) the muffler appears as good as
the day I put it on.
