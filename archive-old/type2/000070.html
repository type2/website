We are in the process of adjusting the valves on my buddies bus and heres the 
problem.  at 180 back the rotor points to number 3 not 2 and the valve is 
super tight at 180 back.  so we moved the crank until the rotor pointed at 
the number 2 plug wire but that's only 90 rotor and pulley degrees not 180 
what gives any help the archives and library are conflicting evidence on hand
Peace Out
