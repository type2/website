&gt;How in the world do you put Fuel Injection in a dual carbed beast??
&gt;

Pretty darn trivial actually, get the parts put em in.  I've done it on a '74,
Dolan's '73 is '78 equipped right now.  You can get a full used setup for
anywhere from $50 to $200+ depending on who you snag it from.  '73 and
later actually have the place to mount the ECU, just isn't cut out, the
most annoying part of the entire conversion is putting in a bracket for
the AFM/air filter, and of course swapping the fuel tank (which you can
do with the engine in.)  Still parts in hand, it would easily be a weekends
work, no more.

Hell the Mark Stephens Stage 2 in the '82 is currently running my '87
Digifant system including the full electronic ignition system.  And that only
took me 5 hours to install, and a couple of hours to modify the digifant
intake air distribution box to fit the T4 case.

With parts in hand and careful notes an L-Jet swap onto any T4 van is
bolt on with hand tools, a drill to mount the fuel pump, and a jigsaw to
cut a hole for the ECU.  It is a smooth running nice conversion for any
1.7, 1.8, or 2.0.  It is way better than a single Weber, and I'd reckon
nicer than dual carbs.  But you do have to be smarter than the FI, which
isn't that hard to be if you can read, and can collect a few simple spares.

You could also do something with a K-jet system, but that is going to
get more complex, and the L-jet is proven fine for anything under a
stock 2.0.
