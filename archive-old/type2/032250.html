Subject: RE:  Heater-box flaps from fan housing
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9905261427440.19800-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; &gt;I noticed the two metal flaps that go between the vents at the 
&gt; &gt;bottom of the fan housing to openings in  the heater-box assembly. 
&gt; 
&gt; Those innocuous looking little pieces of tin are important.  I don't think
&gt; you'll melt down your engine without them (at least not immediately), but
&gt; it's worth the time and effort to put them back on.  What they do is close
&gt; off the air flow from the heat exchangers BACK into the fan housing when the
&gt; motor shut off.  That prevents all that hot air from rising back up into the
&gt; engine compartment.

I don't really know the reason for these little bits, but I figured they
were there so that when the electric blower fan was on there would not be
a backwards flow of air into the fan housing.  The idea above also sounds
plausible, but I wounder how much of a probilem that heat flow would
be relative to the huge amount of heat which I would assume must rise
through the tin and etcetera.
