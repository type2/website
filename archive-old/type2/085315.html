Subject: RE: [T2] Am I sitting on a bulkhead bomb? =&gt; Friday story

A friend of mine has a VW powered trike similar to mine, but the back of fan
shroud is level with the passengers back. The fan in the back of the shroud
is wide open, no screen on it. He has trouble with all kinds of things
falling in it. Mostly leaves and stuff, but it has eaten a whole pack of
cigarettes and a tried to eat a lighter. It did not like the lighter,
luckily it spit that out before it opened it up.
