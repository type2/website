Hello...

    A buddy of mine has a 1964 double-cab for sale.  It has no rust, as he 
bought it fully decked out.  Dual carbs and tricks, a nice interior with a 
good stereo system, nice paint, and after-market safari windows.  He bought 
it for $6000 2 years ago and wants $5000 for it now.  Does that sound right, 
or could he reasonably ask for more?  I know this is a tough call when you 
can't see it, but this list is a close to a &quot;blue book&quot; as I can get.  Thanks.

Claude.
