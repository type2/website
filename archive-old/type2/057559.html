Subject: Single and Crew Cabs Across the Pond

I am really enjoying this Friday Free For All.

I met a gentleman recently who had a BEAUTIFUL 1971 Single Cab PU.  All
original, etc, etc.  Older guy, former VW mechanic.

He said that the Single Cab and Crew Cab pickups were extremely popular in
Europe and that you see them all over the place there.  Can anyone from
across the pond comment on this?  I guess they stopped making those in 1979
everywhere also?  IOW, they are not still made in any country...Not that I
am trying to import one, just asking.

I can say that I don't see many here.

Derrick
