Subject: RE: bumper

&gt; Anyone out there relatively close to NJ/NY have a
&gt; '71 or earlier bay back bumper?

&gt; This item, exactly, is my personal holy grail.  If two show up, I'd like a
&gt; shot at the other one.


I do sell a new rear bumper for the application.  Size and shape are
perfect, and it is very heavy guage steel.  However, it has a pair of
brackets spot-welded to the inside of it (which do not fit a '68-71),
instead of holes for bumper bolts. So you must cut off the brackets and
drill holes.  On the other hand, if you do this, you have a brand new '68-71
bumper for $129.  Worth considering if you cannot find a good used one.
