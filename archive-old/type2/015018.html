&gt;denise,
If you
&gt;feel any movement at all the bearings need adjusting (a very simple
&gt;procedure).

That's good advice, but it's not that simple to adjust.  You have to
purchase a special washer that you peen in place after you have the
adjustment right.  DO NOT REUSE THE OLD WASHER.  It won't work.  THe
bearing will come loose again.  Use a new washer and peen it into the grove
in the stub axle with a centre punch.
