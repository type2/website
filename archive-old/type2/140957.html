Subject: Re: [T2] from mechanical to hydraulic?

Courtney asked:


I've just acquired a 77 Westy Deluxe and of course it is mechanical valves. What is entailed in making it
hydraulic? I always hear the arguements that the cams are different etc, but it is not a sure thing. Can I
pull out the mech. tappets with a magnet and slide in hydraulic and live happily ever after. Somehow I think
I'm fooling myself it's that easy. :-)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I do it all the time. All I do is swap the lifters, use the steel pushrods, and replace the springs with
spacers between the rockers.

BUT I use nice used VW hydraulic lifters from Vanagon engines. I DO not use aftermarket lifters. I believe
that is where the incompatibilty comes from. Mis-matched hardness will cause quick failure.

I have over 400,000 miles on 2 engines [mine and my daughters] with ZERO cam/lifter problems. Except for the
standard bleed off after sitting....

Finding 8 nice used lifters takes time. A good lifter is convex on the bottom. A bad lifter is concave.
