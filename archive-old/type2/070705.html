Subject: RE: [T2] chrome body molding &amp; clips

I recently looked at a 68 bus for sale in Raleigh, NC. The seller 
showed me a bag of clips he bought at a hot rod shop. The clips were 
universal for holding on trim. They were perfect for the 68 to 73 
deluxe trim. Take a piece of trim to a hot rod shop and tell the you 
want to put it back on.

BTW, it was explained to me that the trim SLIDES on. It seems that 
one side of the box section is open on each piece and allows you to 
slide it over the clips. There must be a &quot;best &quot; order in installling 
the stuff.

Good luck
