&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Boston Bob is such a great rebuilder, he ought to be
&gt;able to guarantee at least 15 psi HIOP.  Instead, what
&gt;will he guarantee?  Nothing.  Doesn't that make you
&gt;wonder?

Not at all. Final oil pressure is dependant upon the clearances throughout
the lubrication system. If those are all in spec, you have spec oil
pressure as the only possible result. The motor must be test run to
determine actual pressures.  It can't be inadequate unless something is out
of spec. This all assumes you are using spec lubricant. It is quite easy to
guarantee assembly specs. The added cost of hot running every new engine to
accomodate neysayers needs to verify results that the builder has already
verified in his procedures is just not of good value. 

Again, read the warrenty. I find it amazing that Boston Bob will guarantee
&quot;nothing&quot;, your words. Methinks you exaggerate too much. If that's not good
enough for you and the builder won't build a custom warrenty for your
specific needs, keep calling builders until you find one who will bent over
far enough for your personal needs and purposes, even if such is illogical
to the learned. 

Note that Porsche 911 motors are no worry at all with 5 to 10 lbs oil
pressure at idle. Of no concern whatever. Upon windup they develop well
over 50 lbs and are bled off to some 3 bar by the control valve. The bottom
ends of such motors have been known to run 300k miles with proper
maintenance before wear becomes excessive. Indeed, that is due in part to
the much higher spec metalurgy in the crank/bearings ect as compared to the
lowly VW. However, the T-IV motors are not too far behind in this regard.
That's why they can last 200k and more with proper maintenance, even if the
hot idle pressure is a worry to those who don't understand the very
different loads between idle and underway at running speeds. 

There can be great danger of closing bearing specs to the minimums to
increase idle oil pressure, like inadequate oil volume at high rpm/temps
leading to great idle pressure but seizure of the motor under high
heat/demand situations. The critical oil pressure consideration is adequate
flow for both lubrication and cooling under the most extreme conditions,
not during very low load at idle.
