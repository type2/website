Subject: Re: [T2] smelling gas

Thanks for the response.

I have checked the vent lines and did replace the short bit of hose on 
the driver's side.  The charcoal canister is no where to be seen.  The 
PO must of tossed it out with the FI system.  I understand that the 
charcoal will only remain active for 3 years or so.  Is it worth it to 
get a replacement and install it?

&gt; Is the charcoal canister set up properly with all it's hoses?
&gt;
&gt; Just my 2 cents.
