Subject: Re: [T2] Been thinking of moving myself

I'm thinking mountains, Asheville perhaps. Do they get hurricanes there? I
don't really need to go through one of those.
BTW have you looked outside? It's snowing again. (sigh)

&gt; During my 20 years of active duty military, 4 USMC and 16 Army, I was
&gt; stationed and had temporary duty in a lot of places in the U.S. and abroad
&gt; including Camp Lejeune, NC and Fort Jackson, SC and when I retired I chose
&gt; the state you are in, Minnesota.  At least we don't have to worry about
&gt; hurricanes!  I was through two of those in SC.  BTW, I'm originally from
&gt; Indiana.

&gt; &gt;  Minnesota, the buses are rusty and the weather's lousy!
