Hey volks,

I am wondering if anyone out there can direct me to a couple things:

1) I was wondering which seats from newer VW's (jettas, rabbits...) would fit into the sliders for my '69 campmobile. I know I remember reading somewhere about someone doing this. I'd like to get something nice and comfy for those long road trips.

2) Also, I need a new seal for the pop-up on my bus.  They go for about $90 in RMMW I think. It seems like a hell of a lot for a rubber gasket.  But I really need a new one and was wondering if anyone knew of a place where I could find one cheaper.

Any help  is really appreciated.

Please reply to me personally.

Have a super day!
