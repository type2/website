Subject: [T2] Oil Temp Sending Unit

What type/brand/part #? of an oil sending unit should I purchase for an easy, no mod's, installation of an oil temp guage?

By the way, the engine is back in, and running except I have a valve ticking...It was my first time adjusting the valves on the vw, or any car for that matter :)

Thanks!
