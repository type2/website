Subject: Re: [T2] Cops and Busses

You know, I wouldn't mind if I got pulled over by a
cop trying to figure out what I was driving. At least
then I'd know I wasn't getting rousted for anything. 

I was pulled over at 3:00 AM for a tail-light out in
my bus. Normally, when pulled over in my other
vehicles for minor mechanical problems, I get told,
and then I go home. This time, I got searched,
ticketed, and nearly got my bus impounded. 

Understand, in no way do I look like a hippy. I live
in a suburb of Atlanta, have short hair, and was
dressed in khakis and a golf shirt, as I was coming
home from work.  I had not been drinking, didn't smell
like anything, and didn't give the cop any crap. I was
completely cooperative. 

So the only explanation I have is that it was the bus.

&gt; &lt;&lt; That's funny.. in 3 years of driving a Vanagon, I
&gt; have never been pulled 
&gt; over for anything.  Even when there were obvious
&gt; reasons to pull me over 
&gt; (light out, speeding, etc.)  However, during the 2
&gt; years I owned a 280ZX I 
&gt; was searched over 10 times.  Go figure.

&gt; Haven't had it out in a while, but driving my Bugeye
&gt; is usually good for at 
&gt; least
&gt; one meeting with the Federales...Mostly it's just to
&gt; find out 
&gt; what-the-hell-kind-
&gt; of-car-is-this by cops at least 10 to 15 years
&gt; younger than the car...
