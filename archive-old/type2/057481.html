Subject: title waves...

Volks:
While visiting a friend of mine in Illinois who owns an
auto repair shop, Brooks and I noticed an orange Westy
sitting in the driveway.  It turns out that this bus
needs some work, the owner is not only unwilling to
authorize the work, but has not replied to several
registered letters.  These folks are willing to give us
the bus, but obviously there's not going to be a title;
they'd be willing to apply for a junk title but in
checking with the Indiana license bureau it turns out
that once a bus has a junk title it can never be
plated.  The process for getting a title for the car
involves several months and an appearance in small
claims court, which I'm unwilling to pursue.
The hell of it is, it's a very savable bus, and the
engine even runs.  Most of the problems involve ball
joints and tie-rod ends, which are fixable.  
Does anyone have a suggestion about what to do?  I have
the old woman's phone number and there's no answer,
which my friend says is typical.  I suppose the worst
that could happen (besides just letting it rust in
Illinois) is that we get it and part it out.  I hate to
be responsible, however, for the death of an (almost)
antique vehicle.  If this were New Hampshire, none of
this would matter (I used to live there and went
through a similar thing with a Ghia) because any car 10
years or older can be registered without a title; what
a pain in the ass.

TIA,
