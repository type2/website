Subject: Re: [T2] Radio Speakers

I agree with you on a show truck or one that is in great condition. A lot of
people with a VW in that great condition don't use it as a daily driver. Its
all a matter of personal preference.


I actually replaced my panels with wood from the hardware store and have my
pristine originals stored safely away in case I ever change my mind.
Actually in all the modifications I have done, I retained my originals. If I
had the original curtains I might consider going back.

&gt; I know most people like the Rockin' stereo system, but what is wrong with
&gt; replacing the under dash stock speaker with a $10.00 radio shack
replacement
&gt; speaker?
&gt; I did exactly that to avoid cutting holes in my 32 year old pristine door
&gt; panels. But, if you want to butcher your panels, it's your truck.
