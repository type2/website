Todd,

GEX does have problems with their QC. However, if it is indeed the hydraulic
lifters, you can very easily swap in a new set of Bilstein's and probably be
fine. GEX is known for using used or refurbished parts in their valve train.

I have had some recent exposure to this same problem and the only fix were
to use genuine Bilstein hydraulic lifters. I don't know why, but they seem
to hold their pressure with all different types of oil. The other ones with
the wire retainer instead of the c-clip, are very temperamental for some
reason.

I think Ron Salmon and BusDepot_dot_com sells the real deal and so does Scott at
GermanSupply_dot_com

You can try running a thinner oil, but that can cause some problems with the
motor if it gets too hot.

Unfortunately you can't go to solid lifters without running a different cam,
and pushrods. The metallurgy is different on the cam, pushrods and lifters.

Hydraulic lifters are very nice for a low RPM motor like yours. Solid
lifters are typically only used on earlier and on engines that rev over 6000
RPM (Porsche), which I hope yours does not! :)

Good luck and don't worry, changing the lifters is not too bad. Just make
sure you bench bleed the new set before you install them.
