Subject: [T2] fuel and vaccum lines


&gt; There are two lines that go to my carb in my 72 bus. I have a solid rubber
&gt; line which is the vaccum line right??! And I also have a braided type of
&gt; line, which I thought was the gas line but after taking a close look im
not
&gt; sure. The braided line goes through this small box that is attached to the
&gt; chassis and on the box are a bunch of numbers (im not sure if they were
the
&gt; part number but it didnt look like it) and it says &quot;FLOW&quot; with an arrow.

Box marked &quot;FLOW&quot; may be the typical Facet style
aftermarket fuel pump, 2&quot; metal cube with power wires,
makes a distinctive noise with key on-like a muted AK-47:).
