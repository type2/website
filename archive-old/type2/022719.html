After much archive searching and not quite being able to narrow my search
with the *right* words I still find myself needing to know:

Is there a difference in back spacing for EMPI (or copy) five-spoke wheels
between Beetle and early Bay Bus application?  Also, why is there such a
variance in price from one place to another for non-polished 5 spokes?  Are
there some seriously poor quality knock-offs available that I should avoid?
I want to upgrade to disk brakes this year too, so are there any fitment
issues with these wheels?
