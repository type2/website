Subject: Re:  Aircooled VW Engine Interchange Manual

&gt;The latest Classic Motorbooks catalog came yesterday, and as usual I 
(ahem) &quot;sat&quot; in the porcelain library reading their latest book 
offerings.&lt;

I thought that the J. C. Whitney catalog was the porcelain reading material
of choice :).

&gt;One thing that struck me was a new book called &quot;Air-Cooled VW Engine 
Interchange Manual&quot; by Keith Seume. It claims to: &lt;snip&gt;

Sounds potentially like this book could be pretty useful. Anybody read 
anything else by this Mr. Seume?&lt;

I think this guy is a member of the vintagvw list, although I haven't read
any of his stuff lately (I had to unsubscribe for a while, as the bad karma
level there had reached epic proportions). He seemed to know what he was
talking about (but don't call him Sueme).
