&gt; And don't forget to snip off the tails once they're tightened
&gt;up.  (Sorry, pet peeve.  :-) )

Pat's right, and one more pet peeve I have is &quot;don't leave any sharp edges.&quot; 
If you cut off the ends with the blades of the cutters perpendicular to the tie
wrap rather than parallel to it (turn the pliers 90 degrees from the way you
normally use them) there will be less chance of a scratch or cut later on.



Something like this:


                        \              /
                        |\            /|
                        | \   _____  / |
                        |  \        /  |
                        |   \      /   |
                        |    \    /    |
                        \_____\  /_____|   
                               \/

Sorry about the art. I'm no David S.    8-)
