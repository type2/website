Subject: #3 not again

Ugh, I think I've finally reached the end of my VW odyssey.  Last year I had to 
replace my heads (twice) after a failure of the #3 exhaust valve, then after a 
failure of the refurb heads.  Now, after things have been going well for a 
little over a year, trouble is back.  It started with some noises, lound 
put-putting on a normally whisper quiet engine.  A compression test showed that 
#3 is down to about 80 psi, while the other cylinders are all around 110-115.  A 
squirt of oil didn't do anything.

I'm basically screwed, right?  Rebuild time again?  How long can I keep my bus 
on the road as is?  Should I just mothball the bus for now until I can sell it 
in the spring?  Am I basically rolling the dice every time I try to drive it? 
We'd don't need to use it much, but we do use it.  Still, I'm worried with 
winter coming on...

This is my family's only vehicle, our little Civic was totalled in an accident 
recently.  To boot, my wife and I just bought our first house, so we're pretty 
cash poor.  We've really loved the bus, especially the kids, but I just can't 
keep sinking time and money into engine repairs; it's the end of the road for 
us.  Luckily I telecommute and my wife's office is close enough for 
walking/biking/public transit.   I'd really love to get one of those VW diesel 
Jetta wagons (run on veggie oil, imminently hackable), but the price is a 
limiting factor.  Maybe we should just get a $1-2k used vehicle that is more 
reliable.

Any advice?  Anyone want to buy a Westy?
