Subject: RE: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

With all the talk of where to locate temp sensors, it is becoming
apparent to me that the two best solutions happen to be the cheapest and
the most expensive. The cheapest - the food thermometer in the dipstick
hole. The only downside is that your food thermometer won't match the
rest of your VDO instruments.
The most expensive - drill and tap the case for full flow filtration,
tee the temp sensor into the line coming from the oil pump. ( and you
might as well tee in a pressure sensor also) Every other option I've
seen posted so far has downsides such as incorrect temperature or slow
reaction time.
