Subject: Alternative Fuels (long and depressing)

Volks,

Some years back I worked at the US Dept of Energy in the Renewable Energy
Field.  Back then, the search for a better way to push cars around was hot
and heavy.  What follows is a summary (ie. all I can remember ;-) of the
types, plusses and minusses of various systems we investigated:

Alcohols - 

There are two kinds of alcohol, methyl and ethyl.  

Methyl is cheap to generate, from wood pulp and burns well and clean.  It
is, however incredibly poisonous (even the vapors) and quite corrosive to
many materials used in current (and older {that's us}) autos.  You think
you got gas leaks now? Ha!

Ethyl is much more expensive to produce and competes with food production. 
On a small scale, it's not bad, but if we tried to replace any measurable
percentage of the US's motor fuel consumption, we would drive the cost of
corn through the roof.  Producing either methyl or ethyl on a large scale
is also quite polluting.  Imagine living just downwind of 100,000 gallons
of homebrew.  Tastes may vary, but that is definitely too much of a good
thing.  The BTU/liter content of alcohol is also (as I remember) about 1/2
that of gasoline. 

Gasses-

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)

High BTU content, clean burning, must be compressed to way ridiculous
pressures or cooled to way ridiculous temperatures before it liquifies. 
The temp/pressure problems basically defeated us.  Even after designing a
tank (aluminum wrapped in miles of carbon fiber) that would hold the
pressure, just filling it took ~12 hours.  No one wanted to get into
designing a dewar (cryogenic) flask that would last 100,000 miles on
standard roads, and a dewar would leak very explosive gas fairly steadily.

Liquified Propane Gas (LPG)

Great stuff, but right now it is made from oil, and we were looking for an
oil replacement, not just a different fraction.

Coal Gas

The problem with coal gasification was that the production process
produced not only incredible amounts of gaseous pollution, but the ash is
also toxic beyond belief.  In addition the product is like the natural gas
mentioned above, and as difficult to store. 

Hydrogen

Everybody's dream fuel.  High BTU content and 0 pollution, just a drip of
water out the ol' tailpipe.  The only ways we have of producing hydrogen
today are electrolysis (at best ~5% efficient) and nuclear (everyone's
favorite energy source :-).  In addition, Natural Gas at least liquifies
somewhere below 100 Kelvin, hydrogen is still a gas at 10 Kelvin :-(
Lastly, pure hydrogen is very happy to combine with (read: corrode) just
about everything and most hydrides have the structural strength of rust
(for about the same reason).

Batteries

Not an energy source, but rather a storage medium.  First, you have to
accept that despite the promises of the nuclear industry, electricity is
still not &quot;too cheap to meter&quot; anywhere I know of.  The utilities have
done a tremendous job of reducing the pollution per BTU of electricity and
deliver a tremendous amount  at *very* reasonable prices, but it still
ain't free, and we are really just moving the pollution around after the
inefficiencies of transport and storage are factored in.

All batteries depend on a chemical reaction and a transfer fluid.  The
standard car battery is the lead/acid cell.  We developed some much higher
efficiency alternatives, but none that were good for autos.  The best was
the sodium/sulfur cell, which worked great (OK, only when it was kept hot
enough (~500 F) that both the sodium and the sulfur were liquid).

Successes:

Lest you think we wasted all that time and money, the program had a number
of successes, all of which are now standard in many autos, and you
probably don't even think about them.  

The improved (no-maintainance) battery is one of our successes.  And where
in 1960 would you have bought a battery with a 5-year or 6-year guarantee?
We funded many of the improvements in fuel injection and stratified charge
engines that are standard on modern cars.  Modern diesels use a ceramic
coated piston that lets them operate at much higher and more efficient
temps.  The fairings on top of most semi's are a result of aerodynamic
research we did.  And the beat goes on...

About the only thing we couldn't find was a better, cheaper, easier to
generate, easier to store, and less polluting way to get BTU's to drive
the basic car :-(  Gasoline, with all its drawbacks is about the most
efficient way to move BTU's around.
