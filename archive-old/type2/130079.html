Subject: Re: [T2] Ways to improve gas mileage?

The two easiest ways to improve mileage are:

- slow down. Huge impact on mileage if you're not in a hurry.
- remove unnecessary weight. Most people (including me) carry round a heap 
of junk that they could do without. Also if you've got a campervan and your 
not worried about keeping it stock there are considerable weight savings to 
be had by reconstructing the interior in lighter materials (on my &quot;gunna&quot; 
list). If your really keen it should be possible to make at least some of 
the fittings removable so you only put them in when required (also on 
&quot;gunna&quot; list).

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
