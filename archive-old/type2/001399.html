&gt; Hey Ron! If you are out there (and I know that you are), can you e-mail
&gt; your (e-mail) address to me? Don't have web access so I can't look it up.
&gt; Perhaps you could post the pertinent adresses to the list for all that
&gt; find it necessary.


sales_at_busdepot_dot_com reaches Jerry De Baun, who handles most of our
internet/web order processing and price quotes. busdepot_at_email_dot_com reaches
me personally.
