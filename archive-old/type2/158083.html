Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Parts Photos

Currently I have several of the FI parts. I have the fuel rails, the intake
runners with injectors, fuel pump, pressure regulator, and the entire throttle
body piece, but I am not sure if it is correct or complete. I have some air
cleaner parts, but again I am not sure they are the right thing, they don't
look to be. Right now I need the plenum to attach the intake runners to. I
have not verified that the fuel pump or the regulator works yet, they are just
in a box of parts that I have.

I do have at least one contact that has done the megasquirt on his bus. Would
like to talk to more if they are on the list. I am getting a better
understanding of the parts I need everyday. I have read the Bentley and find
it lacking in certain part descriptions and locations. That is why your pics
have been so helpful. Everything labeled very clearly really helps me identify
what I have and need.

If anyone has a plenum, with vacuum fitting for brakes, that they want to sell
cheap, please contact me. It does not need a working cold start injector since
MS does not use it.

Thanks,
Corbett
