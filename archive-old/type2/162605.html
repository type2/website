&gt; wanted to buy this from the pick and pull type yard what is a

most pick and pull type places have flat rate prices for everything, the
one I go to most often even has a price sheet they give you that has the
price of everything from engines to glass to buttons and knobs.  sometimes
you get a bargin but it is the way all of the ones I've seen work
