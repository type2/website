Subject: cv's and circlips

Hi all
I have been staying up to date with the list by reading
the archives and I finally had to resub, I just couldn't
take it!! (WITHDRAWL) So I pull off my drive shaft to
replace the boots on my cv's and I am having trouble
removing the circlips on the outermost part of the
axle. Any hints??

I have also installed the insulation that I told some of
you about several months back. I cannot comment on how
good it works because my bus is not going anywhere. I
can say that it was a relativly easy install. It cut pretty
easy with common sciscors. I do however have a comment
about the spray adhesive JCW sells, it SUCKS!! I ended
up using 2 sided carpet tape that worked well.

Anyway, if ya have an idea about the circlips or any
other cv advice please let me know. Thanks..
