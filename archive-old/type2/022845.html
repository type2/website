Subject: Opinion of 66 Bus
Mime-Version: 1.0

Wanted some opinions on the price of a 66 Bus.  Here goes; It has a slight 
dent in the right rear corner, very repairable, some surface rust, nothing 
eat into the metal.  It has no motor and has not been converted to 12 volt. 
The Rockers, Doglegs and floor are all in good shape.  All the glass is 
there and in good shape, it will need new seals.  Has ambulance fans and 
all the seats are there, but need recovering.  The price is $800.
