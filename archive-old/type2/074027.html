Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

joel,
	i have never owned a 009 so take this w/ a grain of salt. there are
some excellent comparisons about vacuum &amp; mech advanced dists. in the
library at type2_dot_com. but from what i understand here is the deal. bus
engine not a high reving engine (usually) &amp; there is a large load on it
even in low speeds. The mech dist. will only advance the timing at
higher rpms. but the vacuum will sence the load on the engine from the
increased vacuum &amp; adjust even if the rpms are low. 

	with this info in mind, i don't know what older busses had in terms
of advance. The owner could have also been told that a 009 was the best
for the bus? I have a local guy here who constantly tells me things that
i know are wrong, at least on my 79 2 liter. he is a bug guy &amp; there is
a world of difference. trust the guys who actually drive busses day in
and out insted of people who only sell/install parts.

	one more thing comes to mind here on this pickup. Wouldn't the
install of a 009 be cleaner w/ the lack of vacuum hoses? could be a
trailer queen w/ the sole purpose of winning ribbons.

&gt; It doesn't enhance the performance. Don't they know that?&quot;
&gt; Am I missing something here?
