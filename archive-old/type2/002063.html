After spending last Sunday on the '78 camper that had the dodgey steering,
painting bumpers, wheels white. We decided to take this bus to the show to
sell it, put all the details in the window the night before &amp; went to bed
(early start), got up _at_ 6:00am &amp; went out to wipe the bus down of all the
condensation. Anyway one of my neibours came running out, he knew I was
leaving early, so had waited up since 4:00am to catch me. Paid me £500
deposit &amp; said his parents were coming over from the states in June &amp; had 3
busses over there &amp; had wanted to tour Europe in a bus! So no bus to sell!

We picked up our friends, the owners of the bus who were well pleased(duh).

Now they want a fast-back.:)

Filled up with fuel &amp; headed for the show, arrived _at_ 9:30am &amp; got to park
right _at_ the entrance due to my wife's disabled parking permit! (If you were
there, we were the turquoise camper on the top of the hill)

The show doesn't open till 10:00 so I got some kip in the pop &amp; had a
&quot;cup'a'T&quot;(tm). The show was full of the usual mouth watering immaculate
busses etc. Got down to some serious shopping, FULL door rubber set (no more
drafts),  360 degree marked pulley (no more white blobs on the pulley),
plastic fan housing to exchanger pipes (no more paper tubes) &amp; a oil temp
warning dip stick (no more guessing on hills).

Oh &amp; I brought my legs 2 pairs of shorts.

Great show, the only thing I didn't find was an engine build video for an
&quot;up-right&quot;. The best part of the day, was when the public address system
screeched with feed-back &amp; all those who had over-indulged the night before
collapsed to the floor!
