Subject: Re: [T2] parts cleaning tank recommendations?

The poor man's cleaning device- I used a kerosene pump whose hose was
stuck through a hole in an oil changing pan, the kind with the &quot;funnel&quot;
top and is enclosed, so the solvent will not smell or dry out when not
used.  Lay the part in or hold it and spray it with solvent, then use
lots of wire brushing!  I think aI saw one at a major auto store (Parts
America?) for around $99.  If you can scrounge a laundry sink, these can
be drained into a 5 Gall kero can and use another can or a pump to feed
solvent into the sink.
