&quot;No it doesn't.  in fact, the &quot;twist&quot; direction is the same if you swap the 
shaft end-for-end.  It only changes if you switch them left for right. Some 
folks find that swapping left-for-right quiets noisy joints, but I prefer to 
replace joints if I have the axle off.&quot;

This has got me wondering what the thought is about swapping left for right 
when re-installing freshly greased, healthy joints. Is this thought to 
extend joint life?? or does this create other problems??
