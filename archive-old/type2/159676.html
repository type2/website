Subject: I'm back, and so is Uncle Gerbelmann

Hi Volks!

Just a quick note to say that I'm back reading this list (as
opposed to only being subscribed to it), because &quot;Uncle
Gerbelmann&quot;, my '72 panel van (which some of you may remember:
http://www.gerbelmann_dot_de/gerbelmann.en.html) has just returned
from a really big inspection after several years of standstill.
The only thing that needs to be done yet is the replacement of
the dead generator.  That's scheduled for Friday.

So I'm a Bus driver again, and my, it sure feels good.

If any of you need any help which I can provide through being
German and/or living not too far from either Volkswagenwerk,
let me know.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
