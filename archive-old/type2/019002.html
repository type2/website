Hi gang - finally got the bus on the road (new case was the charm) and
now I'm working on the front brakes because the left was
sticking/grabbing.

There was only one bolt holding the left caliper on.

I've read some of the tricks for removing the pistons -- I was able to
get the right-side ones out with a foot-pump, but the left is really
gummed in.  My mech suggested reconnecting the hydraulics and using
brake system pressure to push them out, so I'll try that.

Meanwhile, ordering repair kits, pads, wheel bearings, etc.

Question: seems I've heard that splitting the caliper halves is a BAD
THING, although my mech seemed surprised at that and said the main thing
is not to lose the seal, as it's not available.  His main argument for
splitting them is to make it easier to clean out the bores.

So what's your experience with splitting/cleaning calipers?

Thanks,
Joe
