Subject: Air Flow Meter problems...

Hello list-

I'm in need of a photo of the top inside of an air flow meter.. mine's out
of a '76 Westy. Daisy's been in the hands of strangers for the last 2 months
and someone screwed with the airflow meter and bent up some of the contacts
and &quot;whatnot&quot; inside.

She runs with the air flow meter disconnected, but will not run with it
connected. I've put a picture up on my website with a circle around the part
in question... I think it's bent but I have nothing to compare it to..

Thanks!

Jeff
'76 Westy - Daisy
