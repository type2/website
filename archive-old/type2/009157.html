Hi,

The weather is beautiful and the bus wants to go camping again!  So.......


May 15th and 16th at Hagan-Stone Park, Pleasant Garden, NC will be the site
of the 2nd annual Pcken in the Park. This is an annual event hosted by the
local Bluegrass folks. There will be two days of workshops and performances.
It just so happens that they have a beautiful campground(this was also the
site of the now imfamous Everybus Campout) and lotsa nice trails and
playgrounnds for the kids.

Although this is not really an official bus campout several folks have
expressed an interest in attending so we might as well crowd the place with
buses again!!!! You can  reserve a campsite directly by calling the park at
336-674-0472. Just tell you want to reserve a site for the Picken in the
Park. If you get the machine dont be scared off by the message that says
reservations are for groups of six of more. That policy is being suspended
for this event.

If you need nore info, send me a p-mail and I will do what I can! 

See you there!
Chris
