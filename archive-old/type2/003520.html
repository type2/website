Hi All,

Thanks for the replies to my previous post concerning type of servo installed
in my bus. I can now verify that European '72s have Bendix (not ATE)servos
installed. 
But, As Eric Forsman stated in his reply, the ATEs can be installed as well
with some modification. 

My experience matched his post almost exactly. I too had to grind down part of
the frame- actually it was the protruding inside bolt hole bore of a mounting
point for the front suspension assy. I was forced to grind it basically flush
with the frame to get the servo in. (I didn't get anywhwere close to the end of
the bolt though.) 
The other major problem I had was with the heater cable tubes which are run
over the top of the servo. These required an attitude adjustment to allow the
servo to seat properly. I used my floor jack and ratchet extension to apply
pressure and bend them up and away from the area. Worked like a champ. It was
one grimy heck of a job, though, I can tell you that! But now my brakes work as
advertized! 

The remaining question is this: When I removed the servo, I was wary of the
possibility of brake fluid being dropped on me. What I didn't expect was the
darned servo to be chock full of crappy rusted water. In case you are wondering
it is NOT a pleasant experience to be lying under a bus and have this type of
stuff catch you in the face and chest...(Several expletives deleted :-(() This
of course is what caused the servo to seize in the first place. I just can't
figure out where all this water came from. Anyone else seen this? 

TIA,

John B.
