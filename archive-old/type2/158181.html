&gt;I have a '79 Bus and would like to know what type of clamps were originally
&gt;used on our bus's FI fuel lines. were they screw clamps or, as I expect,
&gt;crimp clamps?

There were fuel injection screw clamps on top of the engine and some crimp clamps below. I can't remember exactly where the crimp clamps were (Scott Lyons will know).

Either way, I recommend that you use the FI clamps everywhere because they make it easy to change the hoses later.

&gt;Oh, BTW, I was looking at the Microfiche on Richard Atwell's site and was
&gt;wondering where the parts lists are for the fiche pictures.

&quot;Someone&quot; is going to have to add that. :-)
