	I always wanted to organize a 24 hour rally around the
Bay Area, the checkpoint/start/finish line being the south end
of the Golden Gate Bridge, northbound lane. Once you've crossed
that way you can't get back unless you come back on the same bridge
(boo), take the San Rafael/Richmond bridge or take 37 out to Napa
and come back via 80. Very scenic, that.

	Having gotten back to Berkeley/Oakland, you can take the
Bay Bridge back to SF, or go further south and take the San Mateo
Bridge, or further south and take the Dumbarton, or go all the way
to 237 and drive on dry-land back to 101 and head back up to SF.

	Think of an oval track with two possible turn-arounds at
the north end and four at the south end.

	Maybe when our son gets older...
