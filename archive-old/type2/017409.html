&gt; &gt;  And what about additives, like Dura-lube or Slick 50?
&gt; 
&gt; Not necessary, but probably wouldn't hurt.  I don't use them.
David:
I'm agree; I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with an
infomercial that shows, among many things, a Viper driving around a test
track after they'd drained the oil totally out. They missed completely
because I can't remember the name of the product. Seems like it had lube
in it though. It seemed like many years ago Texaco did an ad where they
drained out Havoline and then drove a New York taxi around all day.
Convinced me it gave good protection. What I really like about Havoline,
though is the smell: anything that smells THAT bad MUST be good for your
engine!
