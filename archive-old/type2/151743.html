Subject: Re: [T2] O2 Sensors

Richard and Don,

I welded a bung into my #3 about 3 inches from the head when I re-did my 
Champagne edition.

My thoughts(and Scott's) were that that cylinder would run the hotest and 
give A/F numbers that would be usefull for the rest  ofthe engine.

In other words, it might be a little rich for the other cylinders, but 
that was ok if #3 was saved from running too lean.

Not many ECU's out there will actually modify the pulse width on a single 
cylinder to compensate...think of having an o2 sensor on each exhaust 
pipe.

+1 on all the other stuff that Richard said that I didn't quote.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Those of you who've installed O2 sensors, where did you place them in
&gt; &gt; the exhaust?
&gt; 
&gt; The best place on the 75-78 exhaust is the u-bend. On the others, you  
&gt; have to wled your bung into the manifold just before the HE. Scott  
&gt; Lyons had a great picture of this before his personal website went  
&gt; offline.
