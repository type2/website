Subject: Did I make it to 250lb ft?

Hi Volks,
Does any one want to guess on whether I tightened the gland nut enough??
I had a Craftsman 1/2&quot; drive,  20&quot; long breaker bar with a cheater bar attached to that.  Unfortunately I was forced to push up to tighten rather then push down so I can't use the weight times length formula. I was about 3.5' out on the bar and pushing up with all I could muster.(legs and arms).  The kicker is that I broke the socket head on the breaker bar clean off.  Sears was no help in giving me a twisting torque break point value.  Any guesses??

Rebuild notes:  I have the beam style T wrench and put my flywheel bolts in at 18-19lbs.  Tomorrow I'll measure deck height on all four cylinders
and finally do some calculations for commpression.  Been a long time coming.  Hopefully install the oil pump also. (plugged for full flow and   Berg pressure relief cover)
