Subject: Two Nikki's

Dok Tim is right. I am Nikki with a 73 (in the shop) and a 69 (it has
issues, but at least it's by the curb). The AIRS assistance call is Nicky
(with a 71) -- which is how my mother spelled my name; my father spelled it
Nickie (no wonder they divorced early on) and I changed it when I was 16 to
make them both wrong. ;-&gt; But I digress...

Where is Nicky with the 71?

Steve's muttering troubleshooting checklists behind me here. LOL Basically
what y'all are saying. &quot;Spark, fuel, compression....&quot;
