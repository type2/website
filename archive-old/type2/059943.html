Subject: How do I keep my rubber trim in good shape?

My most recent bus find was a '76 Westy, not in great shape, but
everything is there.  Anyway, one of the good things about this find is
the NEW rubber trim and door seals.  The bus came with new rubber for
the ENTIRE bus, everything.  None of it is installed, and I want to know
if there are any percautions that I should take to keep the rubber in
good condition until I get around to installing it?
