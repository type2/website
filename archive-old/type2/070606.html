Subject: Re: [T2] 68/69/70 Front Beam Q.
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

By Vin # you have a 1970 model bus. In fact yours is the 7404th built 
for the 1970 model year.

I do not know the exact measurements but you can compare a 1968 and 
1969 bolt pattern and spacing to any 1970 and later and see the 
difference.

Good luck

&gt;My bus was manufactured on the 12th August 1969, (VIN: 220 2007 404).
&gt;I.e.: drums all-round, 205mm 5 stud wheels, curvy rear vents, etc)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Q1: Does this make it a 70 or 69??
&gt;
&gt;  and
&gt;
&gt;Q2: How do I determine if I have the later style front beam or the earlier
&gt;one??
