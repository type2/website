X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I just pulled my Sump heater off this weekend and it is a bolt on type, it
bolts on to the original sump plate using three of the nuts. It looks like
an elecrtic stove element with a small protective cover plate. I found no
markings, and have yet to plug it in. About 1 year ago I found a 36hp sump
heater, but I sold it to a guy on the vintage list, I did not have a 36hp, I
bet it was worth more than I sold it for. It worked great. I plan to use my
sump heater this winter if it works.

A friend has just acquired a VW oil sump heater as part of a stash of bits
and pieces he salvaged.

It's cast aluminum, with a steel extension on the side where the 110V power
cord attaches.  It appears to be identical to the heater pictured in an
article in the July 2000 Hot VWs magazine.

Cast into the circumference of the heating element is the following:


    FIVE STAR MFG. CO. ... CLARKSDALE, MISS ... KAT'S ENGINE HEATER ...
MODEL NO. VW-15 ...
    W-150 ... V-120


We assume &quot;W-150&quot; refers to 150 watts, which is not a lot of heat.  And that
&quot;V-120&quot; refers to the voltage
[it has a standard 2-prong plug, like one would find on an inexpensive
toaster].

Is anyone familiar with this item, particularly with it's functional
effectiveness?  If it is an effective heater it would be placed into service
this winter.

Any idea of it's value?  If it's &quot;priceless&quot; the owner will probably rethink
installing it on an engine :)
