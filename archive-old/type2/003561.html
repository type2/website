Thanks for the advice, having spoken with the Garage again, and with me
talking to him about reliability and not liking Volkspares engines, this is
the second one I've had major problems with. He reccomended Vege too, Dutch
he told me but they are more expensive than Volkspares, any comments anyone
?

Ian

&gt;I'm not having a lot of luck with my Type 2 1971 Van.

&gt;After purchasing it and spending £600 on the braking system, the engine has
&gt;now seized on me !

&gt;Engine that has seized - Volkspares Gold engine, supposedly with Unleaded
&gt;heads.

Hi- VEGE UK (Chesterfield I think) do recon engines (try Just Kampers)- I'v
no
personal experience with VEGE but they seem to be popular and I haven't
heard
anything bad said so far !??
I don't think the engine size will make a massive difference for a type 2
for
your speed- guess you know we have a 70 mph limit !!!- but I see your point.
I
suggest you take things easy in your bus and adjust your driving to the slow
lane- think of the great view and put your radio/CD on and enjoy the trip
:-)... the recent thread on why they are now considered &quot;slow&quot; is really
enlightening... depends on your perspective I expect. I do about 60-65 on
flat
motorways (1600 dual port, single carb standard...) and thats near flat-out
but not to the floor.
If you are doing all your repairs thro' a garage it will cost you the earth
!!!- best to try and learn for yourself--its great fun to boot       !!!
