&gt;I just finished putting a 2.0L hyd. lifter longblock
in &gt;my '77 bus (FI) last
&gt;night. It's sooooooo great to be driving the bus
&gt;again. 

Glad to hear that it's out and about again.

&gt;also what kinda oil should i have in it for the first
few 
&gt;hundred miles??  i
&gt;have quaker state 20W-50 right now for the &gt;breakin).

&gt;normally i use castrol
&gt;HD SAE 30.

I like to use the lightest oil that keeps the pressure
up where it should be.  I rebuilt my old (1939) Ford
9N tractor a couple of years ago, and although it had
been using straight 30 or 40 wt before the rebuild,
and not with very good oil pressure, I put 5w-20 in it
after the rebuild and it has twice the oil pressure
with the lighter oil even when I am out mowing for
hours and the engine is hot.
I think that the lighter oil  will lube properly if
not too hot, and it is easier for  the oil pump to
pump and flows easier in the engine, bearings etc.,
and therefore is doing a better job of lubricating.  A
heavier (thicker) oil might be useful if bearings are
worn with lots of clearance and the oil pump isn't
keeping the pressure up as well, but shouldn't be as
necessary in a new engine.

&gt;also, what's the SAFEest thing to spray at the FI
&gt;system to check for vac leaks??  

I use WD40 or other spray lube that I may have handy. 
It doesn't burn  easily but should affect the engine
if it gets sucked in through a leak.
