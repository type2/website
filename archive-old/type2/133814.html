Subject: Re: [T2] can I paint my bus like this?????

&lt;&lt; Good fan control, good volume control, no drips, good paint atomization, 
etc. Gun cost me $50+ I think several years ago. The cost of paint not ruined 
and my time not fixing problems is worth the cost of the better gun. If I was 
doing this everyday then of course I would invest in better tools yet like a 
HVLP gun.

Wanna borrow my airless...Three foot fan...You could paint the whole Bus
in five or six passes... If you've got a barn behind it, you could get that 
too... ;-)
