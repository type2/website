Subject: Bus Boo Thank You!

Thank you very much for a great weekend from the Volks Folks at Buses By the
Beach!

 

What a great weekend filled with lots of smiles and belly laughs. It was a
little chilly but the Spirits (get it..he he) were high and a great time was
had by all. So many great costumes and the kids were so happy. All those
smiles...PRICELESS!

We were treated to 14 great chilies and it was SO hard to pick just one
&quot;best&quot; but Angela's Mexican Chili took home the trophy this year


The turn out was great. There were a lot of new faces which we love to see.
And it is always great to see old friends again. To those real troopers who
showed even though their bus was home &quot;sick&quot; - we wish your buses the
quickest of recoveries.


The entire campground was &quot;dressed up&quot; with the military encampment across
the pond, booming cannons and rata-tat-tat'n guns go'n off all weekend.

 

The Costumes were great (the &quot;Flying Tea Bag&quot; - don't even ask), and The
buses were beautiful (that 66' Splitty was a real treat), 

 

Many thanks go to Kirt and Dave for the late night Phydown! The tortilla
chips and Quezydillas were awesome! Also thanks to Sara and Julie for the
Tie Dying Activity. Thank you also goes to Kirt and Brien for making the
tasty home brews. And to everyone that brought all the yummy chili. 


We look forward to seeing everyone again at Bus BRRR! in February and all
the hearty souls who join us. If you can't make it in Feb be sure to come to
Bus Benefit in May '08. Well, what else can be said? It was another very
successful and fun filled Buses by the Beach camping event. Ultimately it
was a great weekend with our &quot;bus family&quot;.
