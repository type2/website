At least on the type IV, I believe it is pushed as well as pulled.
If I understand it correctly, air from the fan housing is pushed
through the bottom of charcoal filter and is pulled out the top
into the air cleaner. My question is, what keeps air pushed through
the bottom from going back through the vent lines back to the tank?
..unless the vacuum from the air cleaner is greater to keep that
from happening.

My setup is as shown in the manual, except my charcoal canister
is upside down from the diagram.
