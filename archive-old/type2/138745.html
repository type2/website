Subject: Don't forget to order clutch alignment tool!

I probably would have my engine in by now except I forgot to order my clutch
alignment tool when I ordered all the other stuff for my new engine. Drove all
over town checking every FLAPS, NOONE caries alignment tools that are specific
to any vehicle any more. This should be a $3.00 part. Instead they all cary a
universal kit that costs $22.00! Every place had exactly the same price, I
thought price fixing was illegal? Oh well, The guy at the last place I went to
said &quot;It's so expensive because it has a livetime guarantee! Try it and if you
don't like it or it doesn't work, just bring it back for a full refund. Wink,
Wink!&quot; So I guess 2 trips to the parts store is supposed to be cheaper than
$3.00.

The moral of the story is, Make a list and check it twice. Then check it again
befor ordering parts for your rebuilt engine, lest you spend 3 hours trying to
find that little detail you forgot.

Venting over. Back to installing my engine.
