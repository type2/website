Subject: what gas heater is this one
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

a friend of mine once owned a post 1972 camper with a gas heater under the
front seat... am I imagining this is was the entire unit located there... and
what type of heater is that model.

I own a 1971 and mine is in the back drivers side of the engine compartment

(still trying to sell my 1971)
