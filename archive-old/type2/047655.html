Subject: RE: [T2] alternate engines in a bay bus

&gt; Engine transplants include British Ford, Rover V8 3.5 litre,
&gt; Suburu flat-4,
&gt; Alfa Romeo flat-4 and I think a few others.
[...]

The Kennedy Engineering catalog has a very neat chart with lots of
alternative motors and columns of different comparisms. A very useful get.
