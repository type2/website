Subject: Re: Obsessing on Dizzy, 009 timing (how far to set advance)

       No, no, you definitely want more, not less -- the minimum to set
a 009 (or 050)  is 10 BTDC, and I usually ran my T1 upright at 12 BTDC
(static timing) and my T4 at 15 BTDC (static). The basic problem with
using the 009 on a T4 engine is that it just doesn't have the advance
range that a T4 dizzy does, so in order to get it to go to the total
advance that it should, you have to start off so far advanced at idle
that it's hard for the starter to crank it over. But you should be able
to set it to 15BTDC and still start okay, especially now in warm
weather.
