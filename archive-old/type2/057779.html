Message text written by Ergo-North
&gt;Can anyone tell me of a technical manual(s) available that deal(s)
specifically with Solex carbs and Bosch distributors.&lt;

All,
        Both manuals are online and can be checked out via the &quot;Library&quot;
shortcut from www,Type2_dot_com.  Or, the direct address for the library is:
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/library/library.htm
Please take the time to look thru this resource as it will point you to
about every VW type manual available on the NET.
