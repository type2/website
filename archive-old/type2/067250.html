Subject: Re: Mark Stephens' address

&gt;There are those that have had no problems with Mark Stephens, I am not of
&gt;that group.  I think that they have the potential for a good product but if
&gt;things don't work out there ability to back up the product leaves a lot to be
&gt;desired. I will not do business with them in the future.
&gt;If you want the sordid details E-mail me direct.

If you're calm enough to refrain from libel (sometimes people are too
pissed off to be objective), I wish you would post it. Mark Stephens is a
major vendor and people need to know this stuff. God knows they aren't
going to find out from _Hot VWs and Heavy Hooters_.
