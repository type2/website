Subject: Decel Valve Inquiry

List et al,  Would seem that my decel valve has gone on to a better place. My 
question is this: Is said valve really needed? &lt;I've got a bone stock 1978 
2.0L FI eng., std. trans.&gt; I've removed the offending assy. from my eng., 
tidied up the various connections and attachment points for same, and the 
eng. seems to run just fine. No back-firing or odd surges to be heard/felt. 
I'm under the impression&lt;quite possibly mistaken, at that&gt; that a number of 
Type 2's were not equipted with a decel valve, even though they were of 
standard transmission and fuel injected. I assume that the decel valve is 
part of the pollution control system, but as I live in an area that does not 
mandate emissions checks, I'd like to know if I can safely get away with not 
using it. I've checked the archives, but did not find much related to the 
subject. Any and all help would be very much appreciated!
Thanks, Stray  1978 Westy
