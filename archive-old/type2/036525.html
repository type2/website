Subject: Fuel Tank Vent Connections

Everybody,

We all know about replacing your fuel lines regularly.  I just got a lesson 
on replacing other, less obvious &quot;fuel lines.&quot;  I filled up my bus from a 5 
gal jerry can at home, and may have over filled a bit.  After I was done, I 
looked in the engine compartment and noticed fuel dripping from the connector 
(made of about 1 1/2 in of larger diameter fuel hose) where the vent tube 
attaches to the bottom of the fuel filler enclosure.  (I should add I have an 
early '68, no firewall; I have a split one that accommodates my BN4 which I 
will install next time I pull the engine) Fortunately, the fuel level was 
just at the level of the hose and it stopped dripping after a few minutes (I 
also wrapped a rag around it and ran the engine for a few minutes with a fire 
extinguisher handy to lower the fuel level).  The same day I went to my FLAPS 
and got 2 pieces of fuel hose to replace the 2 connectors - the one that was 
dripping as well as the one on top of the tank that attaches to the other end 
of the tank vent.  They're 2 different sizes; the one by the fuel filler 
enclosure (upper end) is larger, 3/8&quot; hose provides a tight fit; the one on 
top of the tank itself is smaller, 5/16&quot; worked well there.  You can clamp 
them if you want (much easier if your tank is out), but I was satisfied with 
how tight they were.  The replacements are both easy to do, provided your 
firewall is out (I have to keep remembering most people have firewalls).  
It's easiest to do if you loosen the left tank strap and take the vent tube 
off.  When I took the old pieces of hose off they were cracked and obviously 
very old.  No more leaks there now.  Thought I'd share this with the list as 
I think it is a safety hazard, even if you don't overfill as fuel sloshing in 
a full tank can still possibly get out that way, and these connections are 
&quot;out of sight - out of mind&quot; back there.
