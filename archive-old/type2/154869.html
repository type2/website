Subject: Faster than my speeding Bus

Merry Friday Everyone!

 

This week Chris at BustedBus did me a huge favor and got a set of 5 Hankooks
mounted and balanced for my Westy (CamperJack) project. This afternoon I
went out to one the rural intersections that are halfway between our shops
to make the pick-up. In the pouring rain (yes it occasionally rains in
Colorado), Chris and I hurriedly transferred the bus wheels into old
reliable Toffee and with my deepest thanks we both headed home.

 

Starting down the country road towards a warm dinner, I went to pass some
confused motorists who were stopped at a railroad crossing. The lights had
been red when I went by them 10 minutes before, but the drivers were
dutifully waiting for the light to change. With no trains for miles in
either direction, I decided to just pass on the shoulder. Buses take quite a
bit of coaxing to get a head of steam and I'm not going to let some law
abiding citizens get in the way of my momentum! :-) (any kids out there,
always obey traffic signals, cops, teachers and don't do drugs) Anyway.

 

When I braked to slow down to pass on the right, the tires I had so hastily
stacked in the cargo area shifted. When I stepped on the &quot;gas&quot; the sliding
door flew open and I watched a couple of my more mischievous new Hankooks
make a break for it! They zipped right past me like I was standing still.
Luckily being on the rural highway, the tires harmlessly rolled to a stop in
the wet grass on the side of the road.

 

Evidentially when the tires shifted, one hit the sliding door lever and
unlatched the door.

 

Too bad no one was with me to laugh with. What a sight to behold, even lone
tires are faster than my speeding bus!
