Subject: oh my! not bosch filters too!

hey  now,

wellllll, seems we've heard of bosch and fram filters blowing up. hehehe guess
i should try purolator? well, i guess any of them can blow up and it prolly
depends on condition of the oil system/engine anyways. so...maybe convert
my '74 and '77 vans to use just oil screens like them rust...er, i mean
splitties? :-) :-) :-) just kidding...

take care,
