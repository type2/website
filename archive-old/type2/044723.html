&gt; Test it again - you need to know that it's still okay.  Save yourself some
&gt; money and buy the compression tester.  It's a simple procedure and it's a
&gt; nice skill to add to your collection.

That's how I did it the first time. Didn't trust my reading, so I asked
The Guys today and they'd already done it and come up with ~125 all round.

&gt; &gt;So you're saying I should remove the #1 plug at idle, drop some gas in the
&gt; &gt;right carb, and look for hesitation. Repeat with #2 plug. Correct?
&gt; 
&gt; No.  Think about what you're trying to prove.  Your hypothesis is that at
&gt; idle, the engine is pumping (compression) and the plug is sparking (spark)
&gt; but there is no fuel entering the cylinder from the central idling system.
&gt; To test this, you will drip some fuel in through the throat of the carb,
&gt; which is a crude way of simulating the idling system.  Don't remove the
&gt; plugs because you still need them to fire for the test.

I miscommunicated my question mirroring your instruction. I am supposed
to remove the #1 plug WIRE from the distributor BEFORE dripping gas into
the carb, so I'll be able to hear if there's a difference in the
performance of the engine, right? I left out one vital word there.

&gt; See if you can still go 70.

Yep, I can do 70. But I have to slide down in the seat and put the pedal
to the metal. I'm just too short to really floor it normally. :-)
 
&gt; It's all in Bentley, and Haynes, and even Chilton I think.  Try asking your
&gt; mechanic about the central idling system, just for fun.

Hah, you one funny guy. :-) Actually, this comes under &quot;Oh, no! Not
another learning experience!&quot; I dropped it off with The Guys, who I
trust implicitly, and told them to take their time and &quot;make it so.&quot; I
told him I'd rather pay him to fix it than screw it up myself for free.
He acknowledges my knowledge of theory at least, and that my
relationship with my bus is &quot;special.&quot; We'll get a bunch of birds with
one stone, since I'm bringing my spare cooling flaps (mine are jammed
half-open and the cable's cut) and little fan shroud flapper thingies
over for him to install since he's going to drop the engine.

FYI, his theory as best as I can understand it (he's got a heavy accent)
is that there's a compromise in the contact at the surface of the head.
But he's not stubborn about his initial diagnoses and he'll tell me if
it's something else. We go way back....

I'll let you know what we find out. Should be interesting.
