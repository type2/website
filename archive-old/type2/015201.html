Subject: Poptop seal on a 73 Westy
Mime-Version: 1.0

Got my new poptop seal; from Bus Depot. Question: The seal that was on
previously was short - only went across the back of the poptop. The new
seal is very long - appears to be long enough to go all the way around the
poptop. Which is right for the '73 Westy?
