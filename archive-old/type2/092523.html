&gt;Now that all the plumbing is in I have a problem with it. When I let off

&gt;gas. I suspect the vacuum in not connected to the correct source. Looked
&gt;through all my manuals and didn't find anything to indicate where it
&gt;should be connected. Does anyone out there have a 75  with the vacuum
&gt;controlled egr that could check where it is connected to the vacuum
&gt;source? I currently have it connected to the port above cylinder 4 on
&gt;the air distribution box. There is an unused port on the throttle
&gt;assembly that points to the rear of the bus. This is the one on the low
&gt;pressure side of the throttle that has vacuum all the time. Wondering if
&gt;the Egr should be connected to the port on the throttle that points to
&gt;the front of the bus, this is the port that the distributor advance is
&gt;connected to.

Tom,

I suspect so.  I don't know much about the EGR for a '75 bus, but in 
general EGR is only supposed to be in effect at part throttle.  Not at 
idle, not at WOT (wide open throttle).  So that would indicate that it 
should be teed into the vacuum line that goes to the vacuum advance port on 
the distributor.

By having it hooked to the other port, you are getting EGR at idle, which 
will likely cause the symptoms you describe.
