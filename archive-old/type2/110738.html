Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

so have we came to the conclusion that it might be the pressure plate ?
just curious?
I am going to wait till this weekend and i'll have the oil filler tube on there and all and maybe will be able to try to drive it a little more maybe and see what exactly it is,and how it reacts?
get back to you on it.
thanks and peace
Cha
