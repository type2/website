Hi Adam,

The birth certificate service by Volkswagen is also for busses available. I
applied late march and received my certificate early april. So they are
really fast. Okay I live in the Netherlands so its quicker then mail to and
from the USA but they respond quick.
By sending in your VIN number youreceive various information about how and
when your bus left the factory.

Here is a link telling more about it: http://www.ploon.nl/ and choose in the
bottom menu VIN INFO.

Busgreetings from Holland,
