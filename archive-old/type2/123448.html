Subject: RE: [T2] Broke down Part 2

Hi Vincent,

It sounds like your fan may be blocked by something -- perhaps the thing 
that caused all the dust to blow thru your vents.  Reach behind the fan 
shroud and feel for the big (10&quot;-12&quot;) hole in back.  The fan is in there, 
and there may be something blocking it from turning smoothly.  If that's OK, 
check your generator.  The bearing may be bad, or the pulley may be hitting 
the stand or the generator itself.

If you drive without your belt attached, the fan does not turn (overheat 
danger), but the generator does not turn either.  That means your engine is 
drawing from the battery to power the ignition coil, lights, radio, wipers, 
etc.  If you drive for a very long distance, your battery WILL die, since 
nothing is recharging it.  If your battery is dead or nearly dead, your coil 
will not get enough power to make a spark and your engine will not start.  
This is probably what you are dealing with.

My advice: get the fan/generator combo turning smoothly -- no clunking, 
churning noises allowed.  Then, get a new belt that hasn't been twisted, 
frayed, or slipped.  Then, get a new battery -- unless you know your battery 
is less that 3 years old -- batteries that have been run completely flat are 
never quite the same.  If you're really short on bread, you can push-start a 
non-FI Bus, but the generator has to be hooked up and working, otherwise 
your battery will not charge.

Good Luck!
