Subject: Re: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

&gt;I've always regarded the barrel to head rings as seals or gaskets - like a
&gt;head gasket, and I would always inlude them (can you think of any other
&gt;metal to metal join where pressure/fluid integrity is required that doesn't
&gt;have some sort of gasket/sealant?).

Sure. Main bearing, rod bearing. Valve. The tightest seals don't have
gaskets (see hydraulic motors). But I realize we aren't talking about
tolerances like this...

&gt;I think if these rings were originally intended as 'compression' spacers
&gt;then they would come in different thicknesses (like the shims actually
&gt;designed for this use....).

There's something going on I don't understand again. What is the difference
betwen a &quot;shim&quot; and a &quot;spacer&quot; in this context? I thought they were two
different words for the same thing.

IAC this stuff is supposed to be lapped in. I see no reason why any of it
should leak or burn if it is.
