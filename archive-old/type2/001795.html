Hmmm, now this is worrisome.  My '78 Westy and I were going through one of
those curbed you-can't-go-anywhere drive-thru lanes at our local In-N-Out
burger this afternoon.  We couldn't quite negoitiate the hair-pin curve of
the lane and  took a curb at a hard thump.  Now my engine seems to be
knocking a little. :-/  The knocking speeds up when I accelerate.  *sigh*
Any ideas?
