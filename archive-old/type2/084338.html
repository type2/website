Subject: dizzy's and power

So a few months back I replaced the 009 distributor on my bus (1700,
Weber Progressive) with a dual-vacuum advance distributor from a '79
California bus.  (The specs for the '79 Cali distributor are dang close
to that of the '74).  Timing witht the '79 Cali dist. is set at 5deg
ATDC w/hoses connected.  Around town the driveability of the bus
improved tenfold, with the bus taking off from a start much smoother. 
Well around town it's been a welcome improvement, but I do a lot of
driving in the Cascades and I'll be danged if power in climbing hills is
much lower than when running with the 009.  Now there isn't a whole lot
of power there to begin with, but when you feel some of it gone, it is
sorely missed.  

So what gives?  Is this to be expected?  As stated earlier, this is a
'74 manual, Weber Progressive, running '79 Cali dist. w/electronic
ignition (&amp; the '79 coil).  All vacuum plumbing is new, correct, and
leak-free; vac can is leak-free.  

Thanks
-Roger
