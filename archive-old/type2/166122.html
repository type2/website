&gt; Down under the water tank is a square opening in the wood. You access the pump there.

Just wanted to add that you can remove that piece of wood with the 
square opening/access hole in it.  That would be pretty funny if you 
tried to change out the pump through that little access hole - it would 
be pretty difficult!

I think you just need to remove the one or two stopper nails on the 
floorboard and the piece of wood will come out.  Then just pull the pump 
out and change the wires.  I *think* there is a screw terminal for the 
wires, but I'm not totally sure on that.  If you hook up the wires 
backwards, it will probably pump the wrong direction ;)

Be very careful when clamping stuff under there.  The tank plastic gets 
brittle and can crack easily.  Be gentle with the clamps and use teflon 
tape where appropriate.
