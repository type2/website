Subject: Post-Thanksgiving blues...

This morning, I finally had the rebuilt engine in and all set up to
go.

I turned the key without connecting the ignition wires to prime the
oil system. Then I connected the ignition wires and cranked the engine
again.

The engine turned, but did not start. grumble grumble

I'll go out and get an ignition tester later today.

In the meantime, does anyone know where in the engine compartment I
can find a source for 12V? This is a 1982 aircooled fuel injected with
the 2.0L engine.

On top of this, I found a puddle of coolant/oil under the Camaro that
I'm trying sell grrr. All in all, not a good day.
