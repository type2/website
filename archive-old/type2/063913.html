I was searching for a four speed gearbox for my 83 aircooled Westy. Found
it from a fellow named Al in San Diego. He gave me a fair price.

Now........ back to business!
Anybody know who buys rebuildable transmission cores?
My old box just needs syncronizers, I just didn't feel like fighting the VW
shop manual to extract the truth on how to install them.
