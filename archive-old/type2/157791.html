&gt; I'm a big fan of Google's Picasa photo management tool. It has a screen saver that let's you point to a directory with photos so you can put anything up you set up. It's well written, doesn't hog resources like some screen savers. No pop up ads either.

If you're a MicroSerf using XP or 2000 you already have this feature built
in.  Just go to control panel, Display, Screen Saver, and switch to the My
Pictures Slideshow.  Go to Settings and browse for the folder containing
your pictures.
