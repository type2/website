Subject: Cluch throwout fork.

Wife was driving our '69 bug home from work on Tuesday and stopped to
pick kids up from babysitter.  Got back in and discovered that she
didn't have a clutch.  I looked at the actuating lever and could tell
by its angle that the cable was in good shape (darn!) so I decided
that the problem was in the throwout fork.

Pulled the engine (every time I do this on a bug I love my bus even
more!) and sure enough, the tip of the right hand lever had broken
off, allowing the throwout bearing to come adrift.

Several years ago, I had the presence of mind to securely weld the
levers to the shaft, as this is a weak point in the clutch design. 
Unfortunately, this failure was simply the result of 30 years of wear
between the levers and the throwout bearing.

Tomorrow, I'm off to the dune buggy shop to get a &quot;heavy duty&quot; fork.

So, why am I writing this to the bus list?  Simple!  The bus has
exactly the same setup.  If you have the engine out, be sure to check
the lever for wear and even consider putting in a stronger lever.  $20
spent up front will prevent a future engine pull!  

If you put in a stock lever, be sure that the forks are welded
securely to the shaft all the way around. (stock is just two small
welds on either edge of the fork).  

The other weak point (as I found) on the stock lever is the notch
opposite the semicircular seat for the throwout bearing.  As the
bearing wears this seat, it thins the metal until it finally fails.

This applies to the early throwout bearings.  The late design (with
the sleeve for the throwout bearing) is a different animal.
