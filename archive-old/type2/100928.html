&gt; Aahhhh. Home again.
&gt; 
&gt; Just got in from John Brown's Buses in Harpers Ferry WV. We left 
&gt; Toronto after work on Friday night at 7:30 PM and arrived at the 
&gt; Harpers Ferry KOA 560 miles later at 7:00 AM. Set up camp and slept 
&gt; until noon, then got up and enjoyed the gang.

you guys are &quot;nuts&quot; but it sure was great getting to meet you in person
