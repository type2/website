&gt;Third, no idea about your original problem that had them replace your
&gt;engine.  No bang, no loud expensive noises?  (Listen to the Muir Sounds
&gt;page;
&gt;http://www.volks_dot_net/sounds/muir/index.htm
&gt;for an idea of what I'm talking about.)

When my engine grenaded (dropped valve) on the freeway, I heard no unusual 
noises.  The engine simply stopped turning, and the clutch started to 
slip/burn.  From the awful carnage that I found inside (piston in small 
chunks, bent rod, broken valve) I thought I would hear more but I 
didn't.  Just FYI - you might not hear any expensive noises... or maybe I'm 
just hard of hearing?
