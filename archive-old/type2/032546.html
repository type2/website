Randy and All...

A couple of years ago I did a major tune up on our Campmobile in preparation 
for a State emissions test.  By the time I drove to the testing station (15 
minutes on the freeway) the bus ran so lousy it wouldn't hold an idle.

Pulled out my tools and re-tuned in the parking lot.  Passed the emissions 
test.

By the time I got back home the bus would hardly run at all, idle or any other 
speed.  Very strange.

Re-tuned in front of the house and road tested.  Performance deteriorated the 
longer I drove.  Repeated this song and dance all afternoon.  Same results 
every time.  Anger and frustration rose to astronomical levels.

Finally paid attention to where the volume control and idle mixture screws 
were in relation to fully closed position before I messed with them again.  
Marked their positions after re-tuning and road testing again.  Bingo...

The screws were both loose enough in their bores that they were actually 
backing out with the engine's vibration.  I grabbed a couple of O-rings out of 
my miscellaneous stuff box and put them on the adjustment screws.  

Re-tuned the carb. for the umpteenth time that day.  Problem solved.

FWIW.....
