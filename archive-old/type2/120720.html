Subject: She's gone...

I watched her as her tail lights faded away in the darkness...

I sold my bus last night. I enjoyed most of the experience but other aspects
of my life have begun taking more of my time and she was suffering from
neglect.

I may try to make a campout or two. Won't be driving a bus though...

-Eric
