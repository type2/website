&gt; I know that buying off the truck is convenient, but geeze, does the Matco
&gt; guy sell crack too?
&gt; 

List,
If you've never been on a tool truck before, hop on one some time if you 
get the chance.  Its like a big kids candy store :)  Except its more 
than 50 cents for a candy bar.

See, a matco/snap-on/mac tool is more than just a tool, just as a bus is 
more than just a car.  Its a work of art in my eyes.  I won't buy a tool 
(unless I *really* need it right then) if I don't like the way it looks, 
feels, and performs.  If I'm paying that much for tools, they'd better 
be flawless.  They are too.  Fully polished/chromed, all smooth, and 
they look nice too.  They just flow well.  They're also rather 
comfortable and easy on the hands.  This is important after a day of 
wrenching.  Another thing is that if I break a tool, it wears out, or I 
just don't want that one anymore I can give it back to him and he'll 
give me a new one.  He even replaces vice grips (when the teeth on the 
jaws wear out)

And sure they cost a lot, but its not like a new car.  Tools really 
don't drop much in value.  There is always someone who will buy them too.


Now for the bus stuff...
I took the 62 out today and tried to heat up the motor.  It was only 
65-70 degrees out, but after giving it on the highway for a while, it 
wouldn't heat up.  It wouldn't heat up just idling either.  I'll have to 
try it again when its 95 degrees out.  I like how cool this motor runs 
:)  Doghouse, FI beetle fan shroud, wide fan, type3 lower cylinder tin, 
and a fresh coat of paint.  Given that I was trying to tell the 
temperature of the motor by feeling the dipstick, but I have a general 
feel for it now. I've turned the tips of my fingers good and red on a 
hot dipstick before.  But this time I could have taken it out and licked 
the thing and have been fine.  Except for the nasty taste of oil of 
course... :P


Isaiah

Anyone have any *old* snap on impact sockets lying about they don't 
want?  I have a 19mm and would like to complete the set :)
