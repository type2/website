 &gt;  What length of fuel line will I need to buy in order to
&gt; replace all the fuel line?

 I replace the FI fuel line with Mercedes EFI fuel hose. It is 7.5mm.    2
to 3 meters should do all except the 10mm hose between the pump and filter.
The Mercedes hose clamps work just like the original VW clamps. They will
not cut into the hose like those cheapo Gates worm drive clamps. The hose
lasts
a looong time.
The part # of the hose is 916030-000527. It lists for $11 a meter.
The clamps are part # 916002-012100. They list for .85 each.
The hose will have the MB star, the part #, and the size 7.5mm printed on
it. The clamps will have the MB star and the # 12 on them.
