Subject: the engine is finished, but many questions (be warned...)
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, the shop finished the repairs to my engine today.  the had to put a 
helicoil in #4, tap out 2 studs, and put in 4 new studs.  the gentleman 
noticed that the spark plugs were not specified for the vehicle, so he put 
4 new ones in for me.  he did all of the work without opening it up.

i did a compression test on it a month ago, and everything seemed 
normal.  2 PO's ago, there was a rebuild on the engine and it to date is 
SUPPOSED to have around 40,000 miles on the rebuild.  sometimes, i feel 
like i am playing the phone game.

next, is to finish removing the exhaust pieces from each other, good thing 
there is a dremel tool in the house for those rusted bolts!  i bought all 
new triangular gaskets for the exhaust, bolts and nuts.  i also have 4 new 
exhaust manifold gaskets.

any tips on putting all of this back together?  anything i should do in 
addition while i have everything apart?  i'm assuming i should use 
anti-seize on the exhaust bolts, what about the nuts for the studs?  since 
the engine is out, it is probably easier to put the exhaust manifold and 
gaskets on BEFORE i install the engine?  i also bought a new foam engine 
seal (thanks mice!)  at what stage should i put this on, before or after 
the engine is in the compartment?

also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop 
fellas were against steaming the engine.

thanks again.  we are set to leave august 3rd.  i'll be heading down to 
blacksburg, va first for an ultimate tournament.  then i'll be out to Mark 
Derring's shop in Salem, va for a last &quot;looks good&quot; check-up.  there is no 
such thing as a free lunch, my westy was given to me, but i have to date, 
put in $4200 over 7 months.  i'm not complaining, because i have grown to 
love this bus.  i just want to be able to drive it sometime, but i guess 
there will be plenty of time for that in the next 6 months!

missy:)
