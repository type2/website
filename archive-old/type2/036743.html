Hello All,

First, I'd like to say thanks for all of the help that I've already received
from the people on this list.  Thank you very much.  Assistance from this
news group has already enable me to do more mechanically to my bus than I
ever thought I was capable of doing.  Thanks.

The wife and I went camping this weekend.  However, it didn't just rain, but
poured almost all weekend long.  So, I had a lot of time inside my bus to
ponder.

1)  On the dash, the switches go Headlights; Dome Light; Hazard, Defrost,
?????.  What is the final switch supposed to be?   It is wired, but the wire
dissappears into a bundle.

2)  I was looking at my roughed up kickboards and thinking about the $80.00
to replace them and wondered if anyone has had any luck replacing them with
thin plywood painted or covered with some kind of upholstery.

3)  After a lot of time in the bus using lights, radio, sink, etc.. just
curious if anyone has any tips on how to install a deep cycle marine
battery.  Are there any problems associated with this?

4)  For some reason, the previous owner cut a huge hole in the rear engine
tin.  I'd like to buy and install new tin (black).  However, I have the
pancake engine (No Doghouse Cooler) and all the advertisements I see are for
the Doghouse Cooler.  Help would be much appreciated.

5) Does anyone know of replacement seats that can be installed on the bus?
The first 450 miles were ok, but after that the spring was just killing me.

6) I'm missing one of the handles needed to open the louvered windows.  I've
checked all of the local junk yards and web-sites I could find, but no luck.
Anyone know where I may be able to find one?

7) When I turn my key one click (Not engaging the starter) to listen to the
radio, I hear a rapid clicking sounds from the engine compartment.  I have
no clue what this sound is, nor if it is bad.  Please help!

I apologize for the length and all of the questions, but I'd appreciate your
help in assisting me working off my honey-do list!

Sincrely,

Darrin &amp; Jenn Pierce
