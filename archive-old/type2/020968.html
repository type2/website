&gt;
&gt; The 12-point driver is more positive and less prone to slippage than the
&gt; 6-point Allen driver.  It can transfer more torque, which is probably why
&gt; VW went to the trouble of supplying them.  Every boot kit that I have run
&gt; across that includes bolts has 12-point bolts in it.

George, list:
I'd join George's side in this fray. I've posted about this earlier and said to
clean out the dirt, get a GOOD Snap-on, Mac or Matco allen adapter, hammer on it
several blows smartly, and use an air gun. The air gun turns the bolt rather
than pulling it. It's nearly impossible to avoid pulling on it with an L-shaped
allen wrench. I've never had one I couldn't get to unscrew, even junkyards where
it floods!
That said, I believe the 12 points are a LOT better. They come in all new Loebro
kits. Sure you've gotta get the adapter. Not much of an investment to have a
superior attachment. Quality doesn't cost, it pays.
