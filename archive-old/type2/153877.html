New and improved model Bus Tow bars - $200 shipped 


New and improved. No more taking the dampener loose. I now make them to
attach to the bus with no removing of anything. Bus tow bars for 55 thru 79
buses. Heavy duty, time tested with over 200 units in circulation. I can
build them for you with either a 1 7/8 or 2 inch ball tongue. $200 includes
continental US shipping. All others are $150 plus shipping or you can swing
by the house and pick one up. Just let me know ahead of time because I build
them as they are ordered. I take paypal, checks or money orders. 

Will not fit Vanagons. 

I also make collapsible Bus Tow Bars.
