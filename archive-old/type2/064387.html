1. I've done the following:
    a. Bought a gallon container of carburator cleaner. It has a parts
basket inside. Just put the bearings, etc in the basket and place in
solution until clean.

   b. Take parts out and rinse with water.

   c. Let dry. Use compressed air to speed up process.

2. If you do not know the age of the non-ripped boots, just replace
them. For the amount of hassle to do two, replacing all will give you
peace of mind. Well worth it!

3. Never encountered the problem.

Hey hey to all
I have a couple of questions that I would like advice on.
1. What is an appropriate solvent for cleaning the grease
out of my wheel bearings so that I may check them. Bentley
says not to use gas but doesn't give any alternatives
They say the gas removes too much grease abd will hurt the
bearings.

2. I have 2 cv boots that are ripped and 2 that are not.
I bought 4 new ones for replacement. Should I go ahead and
do all 4, or sould it be ok to just do the 2 ripped ones?

3. My final question is in regards to the tranny linkage.
My linkage is suffering and needs overhaled. I however,
will not have the time until next spring. My question is
will driving my bus with cruddy linkage do harm to the
tranny itself?
 -- Thanks to all who reply, and to those who just read this and
then delete it too...:)
