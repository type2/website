Subject: RE: [T2] petrol smell in cab

Excuse my inexperience, but how does this procedure done in my 77 westy?
I am having the exact same problem and would like to try this.

Thanks
Eric

&gt;I would check the condensation lines that run up into
the vent area. on the drivers side if you run you hand
along the steel line back towards the firewall (behind
the spare tire protrusion) you will find a rubber fuel
line splice. These tend to be ovelooked and or unknown
as it is hidden from view. Over time they rot and will
leak. Check and see if it feels wet or if it is even
still there.
