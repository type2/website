Subject: re: trailer hitch

&gt;Having said that, does anyone know about any kind of hitch that will
&gt;mount to my bus without replacing the stock '72 bumper?

I have a hitch I had put on by U-Haul.  It attaches via a U-clamp to the
engine support and then has two bolts to the under side of the stock
bumper.  It's a common hitch and I used it for a boat trailer, the boat
being a wooden sailing dinghy and very light.  You could easily haul a
small trailer though getting in and out of the water with a clutch vehicle
is not fun.

Anyway, the hitch is cheap and not hard to put on yourself but must be used
only for light duty towing.

By the way, I have been deleting my messages for a week or so because of
mouse projects.  What's the deal with the &quot;Where do you live?&quot; question and
the map presumably growing thereout?
