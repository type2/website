Subject: RE: [T2] German parts market

&gt; Our local Honda dealer marks parts up 100% 
&gt;  between his cost and mine.


I don't know much about Honda dealers, but I can tell you that this is not
the case with VW dealerships. In fact I am surprised by how small their
&quot;piece of the action&quot; is compared to what Volkswagen apparantly makes on
some parts. VW will often wholesale a part to the dealer for several times
what their OE supplier sells it for on the open market ... yet the dealer's
markup (the spread between his cost and VW retail) is maybe 40 percent.
