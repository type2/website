Hi, Volks;

Nice website on wheel sizes/details, Jan.

If any Listees are interested in acquiring newer rims for
their Bus/Vanagon, I have a set of four OEM steel rims For
Sale for $40.  They're OEM, 5.5&quot;J X 14&quot;, 5 X 112mm bolt
pattern (off my 91 Vanagon) and in excellent condition. (I'm
running 15&quot; SA alloys now.)  Shipping/Pick-up is the
responsibility of buyer.

Thanks,

- -George Chapman, 91 GL (79 Bus gone to new home)
