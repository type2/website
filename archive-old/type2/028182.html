oh boy, I just know this is going to be bad...

I just caught it doing it this mornig, and I was scared this was it..

Ive been noticing those little splotchy marks on the back window like oil 
had burned, and left residue on my window, and I was kinda hoping that it 
was just dripping on the tailpipe and coming up, but when I fired my 75 FI 
up this morning, I threw on a white glove and stuck my hand in front of the 
exhaust.

and oil oil oil was coming out.

What does it mean?

its been running great lately to, and seemingly still is, but is this 
something bad headed my way?

Chris and Kell
and an oily 75 FI &quot;ruby&quot;
