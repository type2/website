Hello
I am in the middle of an engine repalcement adn  ihave discovered that the hoses from the heater control box all the way to the cabin have to be replaced.  Is it possible to replace them with comparable diameter HVAC flexible tubing?  If so, what is recommended?  I assume the only considerations would be heat adn oil resistance and ideally well-insulated.
Also,the orange rubber flaps in the heater control boxes are gone (all except for ittybitty pieces.  Any idea where to find these without buying the whole boxes?  The junkyard ones are no better than what I have.  I had a thought to replace them with homemade ones made with 1/4&quot; rubber (from old mudflaps) and permatex copper gasket maker.....This sounds slightly pathetic,so if anyone has a better idea.......
Thanks 
Mike Edwards
