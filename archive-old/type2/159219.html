Subject: [T2] Hydraulic lifter tapping!

&quot;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping&quot;...

Pack that lifter with a stiffer mix. Maybe the engine too.
Set the lash at zero. Or one turn. Or a turn and a half.
Or two turns. (Depends on who you believe).
Certainly not Muir. He never heard of 5W20.
I still do not understand the concept of 0W30.
Dave
