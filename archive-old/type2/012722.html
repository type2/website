X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Sean,

I actually have all the books you mentioned, but your
web site overview will probably help pull all that
information together.  I lucked out once in finding a
loose wire inside the connector going to the air flap.
 It felt good not calling a garage when that happened
(let's face it, they probably wouldn't know much about
air cooled anyway).  My goal is to be able to diagnose
all parts of the system.  Thanks.

Rob
