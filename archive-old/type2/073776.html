Subject: Good books

the subject of which books to have always seems to come up and I ran across
one that I've never seen mention'ed and thats Haynes techbook for automotive
electrical. Runs about twelve dollars and is written like most haynes, for
the novice, walks you thru some pretty common electrical problems,
That said I'll put a plug in for Wilsons 'how to rebuild book'
I've got Bently, Muir,Clymer and Haynes and at rebuild time it always seems
to be Wilson and Haynes on the bench.
Well I'm off to check out another 'fat chick' '71 westy in the morning, I'll
see if I can keep my money in my pocket this time.
