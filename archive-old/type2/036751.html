&gt;could not get it to run right, so we replaced the whole system with a
&gt;mixed system.  the Wiring harness is more '78 than anything else, the
&gt;brain is an '81 Federal and the AFM is I forget what.  The system runs,
&gt;but it runs poorly and hot in high air temps.  I *hope* by re-installing
&gt;the '80 CA system, with all working parts, I will get the van to run a
&gt;little better.

Yeah but people need to realize Steve was running a real solution with
the higher pressure fuel regulator, just that didn't work out from a,
&quot;I'll probably burn the van down&quot; standpoint, and even that might of
been corrected with some thought.

The problem I see with tinkering with the head temp sensor is you are
adding a &quot;fixed&quot; step in enrichment with a resistor, and as the sensor is
variable from what 2500 ohms or so down to less than 25, a change large
enough to fix it when cold is a massive addition when warm and whatnot.

Likewise tinkering with the AFM will get you some gains as well, but
problem there is if you play with the spring tension, you'll still hit the
wall
at 3500 rpm or so where the stupid thing is flowing about all it will through
that tiny little square hole as the bigger engine tries to gulp more air each
shot.  The things that seem intuitive to me are injectors that flow more fuel
(or via higher pressure) which Steve was trying to look into.  The Bosch book
makes few suggestions for the L-Jet system.  A damn electrical engineer
with the interest could probably map one of these things out in a few days
and figure out how to modify the ECU to adjust and lengthen the basic
injector 
opening interval to correspond to whatever larger displacement we want
(hint, hint)  That still might be a problem at higher revs as you only have so
much time to flow so much fuel.

Anyway, this leaves us with the manual O2 sensor (I'll also note on that
Jegs, and others sell nice little ones that fit standard 2 1/16&quot; gage cutouts
for $30, then $30 for a heated O2 sensor) but you'll always be behind the
curve, not that it is a bad idea, just hardly refined.  It would be nice to
come
up with something that would drop in, not need touched, not be a set of
carbs, and not be a $1000+ programmable Haltech or whatever.
