&gt; I would think that the lifters will be less likely to bleed down if you
&gt; keep your oil level at the top &quot;full&quot; mark on the dipstick (not all of
&gt; the oil drains down into the sump, right? ... so there would still be
&gt; some oil covering the lifters).

Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think it's normal for a rotating mass like the
camshaft to be submerged in oil. The lifters have an oiling hole in them and
when the hole is facing downward (the lifters spin in their bores) they
bleed down eventually.
