Hi,

 Mike Mueller writes:

&gt; Walked into the America's Tire Store today and asked the counter
&gt; person who seemed somewhat knowledgeable about what tire he would
&gt; install on my 72 Westy.
&gt; He suggested the max of 205/70 14 in a Michelin MMT.  (498 per )
&gt; I asked him if this was a LT or a P tire.
&gt; Apparently it is a P tire but with reinforced sidewalls for heavier
&gt; loads.

 Dunno about the MMT, but a reinforced tyre ought to be just about strong
enough.

&gt; bus is stock, will be getting KYB's in all corners and maybe swaybars
&gt; too.
&gt; Any thoughts or ideas out there?

 If you're going to this extent then get stronger tyres. See if you can
find some Michelin Agilis', which are their current light van range and
will have proper commercial vehicle ratings: look for a &quot;C&quot; suffix,
185R14C etc.

 Check out:

 Getting full on, commercial rated tyres will make a big difference to
the handling of the bus. Either the 61 or the 81 will do: the 81 is
stronger and designed for heavier vans.

 I have Agilis 81s (though on 15&quot; rims), KYBs and sway-a-ways on my 
camper and it handles very well. On the minus side the ride is
pretty damn stiff (tyres &amp; shocks do this). The Agilis 81s are Mud
&amp; Snow rated, which might suit you or might not. I'll probably go
for Agilis 51s next time (205/65R15C) these are more road
orientated but they arn't available for a 14&quot; rim.

 Hope this helps,

Cheers,
	  W.
