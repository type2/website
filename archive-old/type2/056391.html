Transporters by the tunnel 98' was great. We all had a fantastic time. It seemed
that everyone wore a smile, was glad to see you (even if they didn't know who
you were) and it seemed that the normal day to day evil that is around us more
and more had been left behind. There simply were no evil people around (Like Mrs
S., who lives behind our house who has grown so evil that her two VW's left
her!) with their really strong negitive vibes. 

And no one called the local law enforcement establishment.

Which brings me to my question. How did they set up Evil screens around the camp
ground? Is it some hi-tech goverment project? Was it something in the water? Was
it a secret,  reverse engineered from a captured alien machine? Yea, thats it,
there was a Water Bug there! They suck evil out of us all. I wonder where it
goes?
