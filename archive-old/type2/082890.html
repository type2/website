complete with &quot;flamethrower&quot; coil. I was going to put it 
on  eBay but p-mail me if you are interested. Price was 
$119.90 US new. Make offer.

Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt;The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an 
electronic ignition 
&gt;replacement module instead of putting in new points and 
condenser. He says 
&gt;he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does 
anybody have 
&gt;any info or experience with these devices?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
