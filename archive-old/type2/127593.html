&gt; Hey hey, a while back I got a dizzy from a junk yard engine. It was
&gt; from a type4 engine, but I don't know what year since it wasn't in a
&gt; body. So anyway it's a Dual Vacuum one, and after I found out that I
&gt; needed a single vacuum one I wasn't worried becouse I read how to
&gt; adjust for one of the vacuums only. Anyway, now that my FI system
&gt; seems to be working, I have found that the Dizzy won't rotate to the
&gt; needed position becouse the extra big vacuum canister is too large
&gt; to swing past the Cold Start Valve. And I think it'll start with
&gt; just a LITTLE more turning. It's sounds WAY better and closer to
&gt; starting the closer you turn it. 

Have you verified that the dist drive gear is installed correctly?
That might be your only problem. If it's off anyway, it might be a
good idea to set it correct, the distributor might fit now. IIRC it's
something like 12 degrees off from perpendulular when #1 at TDC of the
firing stroke.
