Brian -

It depends on what the Federal and State EPA requirements were at the time.
 California 1979 and California Vanagon 1980 did not require an EGR system
because the new (at the time) O2 sensor system met the requirements of the
time.  Federal Models of that year period did not have the O2 sensor, so
the EGR was required to meet Federal emission specs.

However, in 1981, the California specs were tightened even further and EGR
was again required on the California Models along with the O2 sensor.

It's not so much that the O2 sensor replaces the EGR.  It's what's
installed that will allow a vehicle to pass a certain locality's emission
specs.
