Subject: Re: No spark at coil WAS &quot;No start after running&quot;

&gt; Would you care to give more detail about how you did that
&gt; Don, either pmail or list.
&gt;

Just use a wire from the battery positive to the coil positive. I have a 16
gauge wire with alligator clips on either end I use for troubleshooting.
Works perfect for this.

My symptoms were exactly as you described. I did the same thing, checking
and testing every component. Finally one day when I was showing off the GWB
to my boss it wouldn't start. For giggles I ran around back and hooked up
the jumper. Fired right up and ran solid.

It's just such an easy test it's part of my standard diagnostics now.
