Subject: [T2] Kadron parts and pieces

Has anyone seen any of the vendors or Flaps selling pieces and parts for the
Kadron carbs? I need an accelerator pump linkage. I find it amazing that of
all the upgrade dual carb systems out there, the Kadron is one of the most
common and popular, yet NOWHERE can you get any support for them!!!,
partswise except for a lousy rebuild kit!!!
