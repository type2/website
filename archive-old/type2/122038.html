&gt; I have a '77 stock FI westy and my horn has had intermittent problems. 
&gt; I
&gt; am of the mind that a horn is Very important! I want to fix this 
&gt; problem
&gt; before spring comes. It works most of the time if I have the bus 
&gt; running
&gt; and driving down the road straight. As soon as I turn the steering
&gt; wheel, in a turn it will absolutely not work.

Pull off the plate at the bottom of the steering column (held down with 
two screws).  Underneath that plate, you will see the steering coupler 
disc.  Attached to one of the bolts of the steering coupler disc is a 
brown/white wire.  That wire is the horn ground wire.  The horn ground 
is completed when you press the horn button on the steering wheel.  
What's probably happened is the wire is frayed/brittle, and not making 
proper contact when the disc turns.  Moisture can get in there and 
corrode the wire (the disc bolts will probably be rusty, too).

Also, if the steering coupler disc is badly cracked and comes partially 
apart when you turn the wheel, you should replace it.  The part is not 
expensive.
