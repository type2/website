Subject: lots of bucking and i'm no cowboy

heloo,
took goethe to work today. she is a 75 FI autotran.  she drove fine if
i did not give her full throttle.  then when i got her out on the
highway she bucked like mad at 60-70 mph but kept, mostly, up to
speed.  well, i had no choice but to continue on to the jobsite and
did so.  whenever i put the petal to the floor she ran boggy and then
bucked more.  she did the same eight hours later when i drove the
highway home.  she idles better than she has in a long, long time.
she has a new fuel pump, fuel filter, afm, rotor, cap,petronix.  the
dwell, coil, temp sensor 2, etc.  all tested within specs.

thanks in advance for all sage advice and magic spells to make her run
perfectly again.

jeremiah
