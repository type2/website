Subject: [T2] RE: Big Wrench

Wayne said:

&quot;The middle one looks like the wrench (or as they call it a &quot;SPANNER&quot;) used
for British safety knockoff hubs found on later model Austin Healys, MGBs
and similar cars.

See item # 2 on

Wayne, right on...  Good eye balling....  [KNOCK-OFF WRENCH, octagonal 
knock-offs]

I did not notice that the 70mm spanner is octagonal, not hex.  Does the bug 
steering box have a big old 8 sided nut??
