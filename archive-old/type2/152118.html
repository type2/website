&gt; Basically you have to have a trnedy, desireable vehicle and drive a certain number of miles per week in highly visible places. That means the guy who lives in rural Canada and drives a Chevy Citation 5 miles a week isn't going to get a deal with the ad company...

&gt; Would be interesting to know if a vintage VW Westy would qualify. Wonder what that big sticker does to your paint when they pull it back off???

I checked and my 78 plain bus was acceptable, but then I was highly
desireable because of my location. (parked on a major commuter route in a
major city)

don't know about the removal as I never followed thru. the pay a couple
years ago when I investigated was about $250-350 a month it was
significant.
 oh and they installed a GPS in your vehicle and monitored your driving
and parking to make sure you were following their policies.
