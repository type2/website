Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA distributor

I tend to agree with you about competitors jumping on the bandwagon, and buy
from people you know to be good, sometimes you pay a little more, but it
usually is for a reason.

SERVICE and or technical help for the asking.

There is one fellow in regards to the Kadron carbs, AJ Sims, at
www.lowbugget_dot_com is one of those fellows that does stuff the first time
right, like yourself, and has more Kadron knowledge than
anyone................
