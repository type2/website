&gt; Hi all,
&gt;      Just curious if anyone of you has used one of these title places 
to
&gt; title a bus where there wasn't a title available for it?  Thanks,

Bryant-

Look into getting a bonded title for your vehicle. The procedure varies 
from state to state, but after reading the short blurb in the ITS 
website, I'm fairly confident they are just providing the legwork for 
the bonding process.
 
The most important step is to have a bill of sale. Any bill of sale.  
These processes run into trouble if the vehicle has a recent 
registration, is stolen, etc.

good luck
matt
