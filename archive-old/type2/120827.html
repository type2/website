Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

As a followup to my initial post, I was able to reattach the oil pickup
without splitting the engine case. 

I found the original locknut and washer inside, still in good shape. I did
not have a 6Mx36mm stud but did have a similar length 6M bolt. I threaded
it into the case and positioned the washer and locknut above, holding the
oil pickup in place, so that when the bolt came through it threaded into
the locknut. Not easy. The nut wanted to do a little dance on top of the
bolt but with careful fingering I was eventually able to center it so that
it worked. 

Several listees suggested fabricating a bent 10mm wrench to hold the nut. I
did not have one or the means to make one. I was able to hold the nut tight
enough with my fingers for it to self-lock a little but not as tight as it
should have been. When all was in place I cut off the bolt head to make a
working stud.

This is a temporary fix until I can find or make a wrench angled enough to
next time really hold the nut tight, so I did not use loctite. 

When I make the permanent repair I'll report back how it goes. 

Cheers,

Arathorn
