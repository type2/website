Subject: Upholstery

Hi List,
Commander Cody is home from the body shop (phase 2)!
We need to find a source for upholstery for the rear fold-down seat. (It
makes up into a bed vis-a-vis the cushion behind it). Are we going to
have to go custom for upholstery (Sew-fine couldn't make the kit)? The
existing weird yellow covers have snaps that fasten on to a box-like
cabinet the seat rests over. Ideas?
Also, Steve Dolan (?) was going to do a template for a floor in a westie
last fall? Did I miss this post?
Inquiring minds want to know...
I'll be under the bus, under coating, sweating, and thinking about all
the great camping to come! 

Thanks in advance!
