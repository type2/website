Volks, 

I am moving to Italy and am taking my 68 Campmobile with me. I would like to
know of some insurance companies that offer European auto insurance.

Next, I need to know if it would be advisable (or not) to leave my US plates
on the car or to register them in Italy. I suspect that registering in Italy
would be a major headache and would cost considerably more.

Finally, I would like to hear from folks who have shipped a vehicle to
Europe and what I can expect as far as fees, potential issues, hidden fees,
fumigation of the vehicle, import taxes etc.

Anyone have information on reputable safe shippers?

Thanks in advance,

Matt
