&gt;&gt;and I can't figure out what
exactly the two knobs in the right front lower of the driver's seat are for&lt;&lt;

The knob on the right hand side (as you sit on the seat) of the seat pedastal
controls the stock heater vent that goes into the rear cabin, the air comes
out right at the rear of the walk-thru section. Pull the knob out, heat is
directed to this rear vent, push it in and that vent is closed.
