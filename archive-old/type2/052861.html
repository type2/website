Subject: engine out...what happened

hey volks,
well as you all know my motor is out.   i just wanted
to update you all.   i put a page up on the website
about the engine pull, sort of a how to, might help
out a newbie doing a first time engine pull, who
knows.   its at:

secondly, i beleive i figured out what happened.  
when i was removing the head (actually when i was
checking my head torque before i pulled the motor) the
upper and lower head bolts closest to the #1 were a
bit loose.   so im thinkin they loosened up while
driving causing a vacuum leak to #1 and then
detonation and my lovely meltdown.   thanks to all for
your support and advice.   looks like ill be replacing
all the pistons and sleeves since i have to buy in a
set of 4 anyways.
thanks everybody
