Subject: Re: speedo repair

If all you want is repair PA Speedo is probably as good as any. But don't
expect any cosmetic work from them. I sent my Type 3 Ghia speedo to them
and when I found out they wouldn't do the cosmetic work I needed I had to
get it shipped back to me in parts so that I could paint the bezel and
polish out the plastic face. Since then a fellow T34 Registry member found
a source that will do the whole enchilada - and they're cheaper. Its
called Foreign Speedo in San Diego. A writeup with picture can be seen by
going to type34_dot_org and searching on 'Gauge Restoration'.

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any familiarity or experience with Palo Alto
&gt; Speedometer repair?
&gt; I'm thinking of having the speedo's for my 68 Beetle and 73 Bus
&gt; restored.
