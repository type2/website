Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

&gt;&gt;  After a couple  of years of problems, Ford threatened
&gt;&gt;to close Jaguar down altogether  if they didin't change their law.  Faced
&gt;&gt;with that possibility,  they relented.  Now Jaguar has one of the highest
&gt;&gt;customer  satisfaction ratings of any vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;My problem with them is that they look like Fords!  :(
&gt;
&gt;Like VWs, Jags used to be some of the most recognizable vehicles on the
&gt;road.  Those sexy curves have morphed into more pedestrian sedan shapes.
&gt;
	That's only the start of Ford's offences at Jegwore.
	They deep-sixed Jaguar's air-injected V6 using Ralph Sarich's 
well proven &quot;orbital&quot; method {an unhelpful name] to increase power &amp; 
economy  -  see 
http://www.orbeng_dot_com.au/orbital/directinjection/technical.htm . 
This is the next motor  -  obviating poppet valves, camshafts, 
cylinder head gaskets {yes, I know VW did that too}, cylinder heads 
{no, they didn't do that}, most of the pollutants in the exhaust, a 
lot of weight, etc.
