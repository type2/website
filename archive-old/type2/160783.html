&gt;HELP!
&gt;   I hooked the caliper back up to the bus and pumped the pedal 
&gt; mightily, but the piston won't budge.  Do I need a new caliper?

If you bled the system properly, and you cannot budge the piston with 
pedal pressure, for sure that sucker is frozen big time. Definately 
trade it as a core for a reman or get another. Watch out for those 
remans. Too many times they have a different location to hook up the 
line and it can be real tricky installing them. Compare old with new 
BEFORE paying your money.

Know also that frozen calipers are always due to contamination, which 
proves the whole system is contaminated. Plan to replace all the 
hoses and cylinders as well because the problems will continue until 
you do. And brakes are not optional even for a trip to the local 7-11.
