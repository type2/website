&gt; Yes, cheap parts are the responsability of those who sell them, not the
&gt; person that buys into the sales pitch.

electronic parts of all type can fail out of the box, that is why in
critical paths the part is run in,  &quot;infant mortality&quot; is a fact in
electronics, many millions have been spent trying to prevent it but they
still don't completely understand the cause.  generally speaking any
electronic part that operates successfully for the first hour will most
likely exceed it's life cycle expectancy 

&gt; &gt;When I installed the Pertronix, the only variance from the initial setup,
&gt; &gt;after timing, was the Dwell. I could not get the same dwell. I did not try

my dwell is within spec, out of the box

&gt; motor. Not optional to run without full advance fuction. But if you can
&gt; accept non spec dwell, what's a few extra degrees of advance to worry about.

one thing I have to say about my Pertronix is that the dwell is rock
steady over the entire range of RPM's something my points never would do,
and the advance is right on spec.  (but my advance is working)

&gt;  But I still carry a
&gt; &gt;set of points and condenser in the glove box.

&gt; Yes, indeed, when wizbang fails, fall back up to Neandereering to get you
&gt; home fer sur.

I don't know about you but when I buy new tires I buy 4 not 5, I put the 4
on the bus then take the best of the older ones to use as a spare.
whenever I changed my points, or rotor, or plugs even I always threw the
old ones into an ammo can that I carry for emergencies.  why buy new parts
for spares when you have working used parts...these are &quot;SPARE&quot; parts they
are to &quot;get you home&quot; not to replace the parts in use.  and certainly in
the 20+ years since our buses were built there have been some advances in
engineering of motor vehicles and parts, some of which can be applied to
older vehicles to improve reliability or reduce maintenance.  (the thing I
like most about my 78 is that it has Hydralic lifters, after 23 VW's I
finally don't have to crawl under the dang thing to adjust the gap every
3,000 miles, if there was one job that I procrastinated on it was the
valve train adjustment!)
  VW recognized improvements, the type IV engine is arguably a prime
example of VW improving the quality of their engines

not all improvements to systems engineering is bad, heck how many cup
holders are in a splitty or a bay??? but the new ones have plenty of cup
holders, improvements can be large or small but they improve the product.
There are those who only want their busses dead on accurate as built, and
then there are those that drive theirs every day and they tend to be
&quot;Modified&quot; to suit the needs or foibles of their owners.

there is no &quot;perfect&quot; solution since the needs of different people are
&quot;different&quot;, the DM is a &quot;Method&quot; not a product

following the DM can get different results based on the &quot;goals&quot; or
preferences of the fabricator.  the DM demands research and knowledge of
the systems being worked on and produces a result that is acceptable to
the systems engineer and/or customer.

my demand for additional heat/defrost, for example,  does not say that the
German engineers who built my van were wrong, but rather I wanted &quot;more&quot;
than they provided.  The design and fabrication of the &quot;custom&quot;
heat/defrost system in my bus are not violations of the DM but rather
building upon the DM to provide a result that was not deemed &quot;neccesary&quot;
or economically viable to VW..   Always remember the VW was built as an
&quot;economy&quot; car and there were corners cut and cost/benifit/marketing
decisions were made throughout the design and fabrication process.  The VW
was not a Mercedes Benz nor was it marketed or aimed at the same
purchaser.
