&gt;  With that advice I decided to get seal he sells that's German OEM. He 
&gt; told me it's made from EPDM rubber by Metzler and I decided (before the 
&gt; Euro went up against the dollar) that it was work the extra $20 not to 
&gt; risk breaking the windshield.
&gt;When it arrived it looked very nice. Sure enough the bodymen who installed 
&gt;it said it was a perfect fit and a breeze to install. I was really taken 
&gt;back when they were thanking me for doing this for them. I strongly 
&gt;recommend it.

That goes for all the body seals. OEM side door seals fit perfect, very 
easy (fast) to install and they hold themselves locked in place. A drop of 
adhesive at each corner only is needed. I have yet to see anything 
aftermarket for doors, windows, hatches that isn't a pain to get set, 
requires adhesive, and cross your finger that you get an effective full 
perimeter seal. OEM is sound policy for any part on the machine, even if 
extra efforts are require to get it at whatever the cost may be. There is 
no better way to nip risk of short term failure than using original German 
parts if you can get them.

If I had a glass shop I would use Ford seals for Fords, Honda seals for 
Honda, and Euro seals for all Euros. The lowest bucks glass shops use 
generic seals for all. You get what you pay for, and you always must pay 
more than &quot;whip it out as cheap as possible&quot; for real quality, better 
function, longer life, less cost per mile.
