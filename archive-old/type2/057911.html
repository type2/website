	After you drive it for a while, put your hand on the coil. If
it's real hot then it's bad, if it's just warm then it's probably ok.

&gt;Greetings...
&gt;
&gt;Quick question...
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone describe some of the signs and symptoms of a weak coil or a
&gt;coil that is fading fast?  What types of things are associated with 
&gt;this
&gt;and how does one know when to replace it?
&gt;
&gt;Not that it matters, but it's a 12v coil on an upright engine.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
