Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats in 78?

Hi Duke,

I can vouch that 1980, 82, 84 and '88 vanagon seats will fit. AFAIK  
they all use the same tracks through 1991.

Happy trails,

&gt; I'm looking to swap out my seats for some Vanagon seats and have the

&gt; versus model
&gt; years that don't or are all Vanagon seats swappable in this manner?
