Subject: Cheap heat

Sorry, guess I didn't go into enough detail, and did not use the correct
terminology.

I have a 2L FI-wrapped the heat control boxes.  If I had an earlier engine,
I would consider wrapping the heat exchangers, though it would be more
difficult.
Sorry for the confusion.

  Was messing around this morning, and
&gt; the thought hit me since the heat risers are totally uninsulated what
would
&gt; happen if you wrapped aluminum foil around them.
