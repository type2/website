Subject: Sunroof clip source and replacement

Hi All,

	One Statement and
	Two questions...

	I need a whole new roof for my '67 21 window.

	Does anyone know a source for one in California?

	Has anyone put one on and lived to tell about it?

	Currently, I've located one in Washington...1000miles away...too
far....
	and I have ideas on how make sure it goes on correctly.  
	Tack welding fixed supports and such. 

	Advice Appreciated.
