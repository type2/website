Forwarding this because the server bounced it out. I don't know why. It
sniffed something. I have to screw around for a few lines here to confuse
it. I am learning a badass scripting language called Frontier so I can run
the list from home and dump Majordomo. Okay, let's see here:

Inuvik attracts some of the most interesting tourists in the world.
Remember the Japanese man who walked up the Dempster Highway one winter?
Here's another interesting group.
        A convoy of 13 Volkswagen buses puffed into town last week, piloted
by drivers from Puerto Rico to Edmonton, Ohio, Indiana, Washington and
Texas.  Some drove for more than three weeks to get here.
        How did they all get together--and why were they here?  Blame the
Internet.
        A Vancouver couple gave Californian Ron Lussier the idea for a VW
Dempster trip, so he posted an ad on the Internet.  Replies fired back:
&quot;We're coming to do the Dempster Dare.&quot;
        VW owner Brian McDonald had it easy.  The Inuvik man has been in
contact with the group on the 'net for months, and welcomed them when
they arrived.
        It hasn't all been &quot;Fahrvergnugen.&quot;
        So far, the group has suffered six blown tires, two overheats, a
fuel line problem, and required one set of brakes, two wheel bearings
and a shock absorber.
        One man had a huge stash behind the front seat--an extra engine,
just in case.  And then there's &quot;Sideways Sue&quot; who ditched her van on
kilometre 2 of the Dempster.
                &quot;But consider that half of those problems were on my bus,
and it's
26 years old,&quot; pipes in Eddie Hintz.  The colourful 20-something Texan
drives a van that Timothy Leary (God rest his soul) would have been
proud to trip in.  His new &quot;I survived the Dempster&quot; bumper sticker is
plastered among such revolutionary slogans as &quot;Will be president for
food.&quot;
        &quot;That's almost as revolutionary a statement as those other
stickers,&quot; says Hintz.
        Somehow, this odd, lozenge-shaped bus and its little brother,
Herbie--the VW Beetle--have come to symbolize the counterculture.  Make
love, not war.  Smoke it if you got it.  And somehow, many of these
faces also define that culture.
        I couldn't resist asking, as the group huddles under the shadow of
the Igloo church: do hippies and VW vans go hand in hand?
        &quot;It depends on what you mean by 'hippy,'&quot; says one driver,
defiantly.
        &quot;Peace and love and all of that,&quot; I say.
        &quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; he replies.
        Some are obviously old hippies with weathered headbands and sublime
grins.  But others have hauled along their 2.5 kids and the dog.  Like
their strange wheels, these people are as interesting as they come.
        What's the attraction of this frumpy [TTC: Hey!] little van?  They
answers come in a flurry: &quot;Have you ever driven one?&quot;... &quot;You just get
this crazy smile on your face.&quot; ... &quot;It's the flat (steering) wheel you
can lean on, like a bus.&quot;
