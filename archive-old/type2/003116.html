RE: Volkswagen; what are you trying to do?

It's probably on non-item for this list but what you're mentioning applies
mostly to VoA only. Hannover / Wofsburg do make em. And the Eurovan has more
cargo-space than a vanagon. My Eurovan has a 5 speed manual linked to a 60
hp 1.9 diesel. Now I call that basic !

However (bus content!) having the engine underneath the double bed as in a
loaf or Vanagon is probably more space efficient when used as a camper. But
when trying to move big objects the engine compartment definitely gets in
the way.
