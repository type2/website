Hi to all,

But pay attention to your bus! When I run super here in CO the Guac actually
runs worse. The mid-grade is ideal. So that's what I use. When I visited CA
I threw super in just to see. Ran better than midgrade. So you really need
to pay attention to what your bus likes and what conditions you're driving
in.

The Guacamole Bus
Don is right about using the gas your bus likes but thanks to our &quot;friends&quot; at the EPA a certain fuel that works well in your bus in one part of the country of even in one part of the state may not work well in another. The reason for this is that the EPA mandates different fuel additives for different local conditions. 

These additives can have a significant effect on how your vehicle runs. Here in Central California we have winter gas and summer gas to try and reduce our significant smog problem. My bus (Betty) does not like the winter gas and runs rougher than when using the summer formula.

I have a friend who works at the Chevron oil refinery in Martinez and he claims they make at least two dozen different gas formulations to meet EPA requirements for the various regions they supply. 

All the best - Andy
