&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
    Well, I spent Saturday morning replacing the left heat exchanger on
 my '77 pancake. Unable to find a &quot;German VW&quot; exchanger I once again fell
 back onto the Dansk one- is it possible that the fit quality has actually
 dropped since last time? &gt;&gt;


I replaced the driver's side recently on my '74 and discovered that the newer 
Dansk exchanger was slightly different and the holes for the exhaust outlet 
were about 1/2 inch higher than the old Dansk exchanger.  I placed the old 
and new next to each other after I discovered my exhaust system wouldn't 
mount up to the new exchanger.

I managed to loosen everything up and then slowly tighten it all and made it 
fit.  The exchanger now hits my bumper bracket and I get a bit of a rattle 
until the engine warms up.  I think the only answer to this problem is to 
replace both exchangers at the same time.  I would hope that the new Dansk 
units would match up.
