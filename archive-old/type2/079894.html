Subject: RE: [T2] Heating Ducts

Hi Rick,

	Since I just got thru getting my heat setup done a few weeks ago in my '72
this is still pretty fresh in my head.  The heating duct in question is at
the rear edge of the raised section between the seats facing the rear
passenger compartment.  It may be covered with carpet or whatnot, but this
is where it should be.  The knob under your drivers seat is indeed the
control for this duct.  On my bus, pushed in is open, pulled out is off.
There are a few possibilities why the vent may not be working (or appear to
be working).  1) Cable or flapper box is broken or jammed.  2) Diverter tube
(don't know the technical term)is loose or broken.  3)Tube is clogged with
critters nest or other muck. 4) Insufficient airflow from stock system won't
push heat thru vent.
	If you crawl under your bus you will see that there is a 45 degree split of
flexible tubing coming off your main heat tube (as I recall it goes toward
the drivers side slightly).  There should be a stiff wire clamp or two
holding the ends on.  Revove these and check for cracks or blockage in the
tube.  Clean out or replace tube as necessary (preheater hose at flaps will
likely work if NOS is unavailable).  If tube is unblocked, try shining a
bright light into the output opening facing the rear of the bus (where the
tube came off).  Climb in and see if the light is shining through.  If so,
you should be all clear and good to go.  Lastly, check that the flap in the
control is moving freely (this should be obvious by looking at it) and in
the open position.  If all looks good, put the whole mess back together and
fire up the bus.
	As you have probably realized, the heat system in the bus seeks the path of
least resistance.  When using this vent, you are effectively reversing the
forward flow of heat from the back of the bus, hence not real efficient.
	Until I recently installed a 3&quot; bilge blower, I was convinced that my rear
vent was non-functional.  Imediately after installing the blower it is quite
apparent that the vent always worked, there just wasn't enough flow with the
stock heating system to really get much of anything from the vent.  If you
don't have a blower yet, this is probably the best investment in clear
windows and lack of frostbite you can make for your bus outside of a gas
heater.  On a 20 minute drive in 30 degree weather, I can get about 130
degrees out of my defrost vents in my not-so-perfectly sealed heat system.
Not too shabby for a total investment of under $50.00 and two hours labor.
Now the only thing that will keep me and Gretta off the roads this winter is
the thick layer of salt on the New Hampshire roads.

									Good luck, hope this helps.
