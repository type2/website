Subject: no lowbeams

Well, shoot. Being a scaredy cat about electricity has made me avoid all that stuff. Now that my low beams don't work, after seeing that the fuses are alright, I'm just at a loss. I looked in the library as well as in the archives without anything that seems just like my problem.
Nothing turns off when I use the turn signal. The lights don't flicker. The low beams don't just work on occassion. My high beams work just fine, but I don't want to drive July 4th weekend from Myrtle Beach SC to Charlottesville VA, blinding any potential Bus bretheren along the way. 
For what it's worth, my low beams were working fine, but toward the end of my drive to Kill Devil Hills it was late, it was dark, and I was toggling back and forth between high and low depending on if there was traffic in front of me. I was on the long, dark, sandy NC 12 when I hit the low beams and got no headlights instead! Parking lights are fine, high beams fine, just no low beams. 
Anyone have a clue? Is it just a bad switch?

In advance, thanks!
