I have rubber seals running along the inside of the windows- I'm missing the
one which runs on the outside of the top window- not the window seal itself.
It fits in a groove in the top piece of the window when the top piece is
off. Do RV stores sell parts for Jalousie windows? Does anyone know the
correct spelling for jalousie (?) windows because in this great computer age
I can't find my dictionary. TBear
