Subject: Good source of tools, supplies, etc.  

I just ordered a bunch of stuff from American Science and Surplus -  www.sciplus_dot_com
.  This company offers lots of items that are useful for VW restoration - small
tools (clamps, dremmel stuff, medical tools, magnets, etc.); electrical stuff
(resistors, led's, wire and terminals);rubber and vinyl scraps; small electric
motors and fans; as well as toy items and unusual items (6 ft. O ring, wood
venetian blind slats,   Most of this stuff is surplus or cheap imports.  Often
it is incredibly cheap, sometimes its overpriced.  Order one of their hard copy
catalogs to get the whole picture.
