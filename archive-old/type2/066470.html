Yeah, there's a 1979 Bug convertible for sale where I live with less than 
20k miles for-get this-$17,000. Been for sale a long time...wonder why.

Sorry, this is not bus related, but I thought most would be interested
to hear that the asking price for a &quot;time-capsuled&quot; '79 beetle
convertible with 91 (!) original miles is $19,750. Seen in
Pennsylvania this weekend.
