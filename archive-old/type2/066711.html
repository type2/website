&gt; I tried this with Rustoleum's high-temp BBQ/Stove paint when I
&gt; recently installed a single quiet-pack muffler on my 78.  The paint is
&gt; rated to 1000'F, and it's already blistering off the extractor pipe.
&gt; I've only driven the bus on about 4 short drives (&lt; 10 mi/each) since
&gt; the installation.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know any paints with higher temp rating?

POR-15 makes product called POR-20 that is supposed to be able to stand
temperatures up to 1400 degrees, as well as prevent salt and moisture
from penetrating. I'm going to buy some for my upcoming exhaust/heat
exchangers rebuild extravaganza... their number is 1-800-457-6715.
