Here's a rule of thumb: if Wilson says to do something, do it. That book 
is not a book for hot rodding a VW engine. He doesn't recommend 
performance modifications, that I can recall. It's a minimalist approach 
to engine rebuilding. So if he says replace the rod nuts, you should 
replace the rod nuts. If you do, and nothing happens, you can resent the 
$4 you spent on nuts. If you don't, and you throw a rod, you'll think, 
&quot;gosh, I should have replaced the nuts.&quot;

Dealer should have them.
