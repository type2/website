Hi Rob,

I was thinking about the same thing with my Bus.  Fans mounted on either 
side, inboard of the battery trays, sitting vertically.  They'd suck in air 
from the intakes, blow over the heads, and put positive pressure on the 
intake fan.  It seems like it would work well at low (town) speeds.

The tough thing about providing cooling air at high (freeway) speeds is that 
you need a fan that will push more CFM of air than you'd already get at 
70mph.  The other thing is that no matter how much air you push, if it's 95 
degree ambient air, it's not going to cool the engine as much as 60 degree 
air.

Now if you could devise some sort of intercooler so the engine always gets 
60 degree air...

Of course, you could give up the whole air-cooled idea and buy a nice 
water-cooled Vanagon.  Those never have cooling (coolant) problems... :-P
