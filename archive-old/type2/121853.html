Subject: Cost Effectiveness of Points Replacement Conversions?

Friday Gruntings and Salivations, Esteemed List!

There's been a few posts lately WRT wondering about Points Replacement
Conversions; so for all of you out there wondering about the
cost-effectiveness of the p.r.c. vs just sticking with your old
Kettering points systems (with all of it's hassles), consider this...

During the course of post-BBB8 dwaddling with getting the Mallory Hyfire
6A installed onto the wife's Karmann Ghia, I decided to pick up a set of
points and a condenser from my Friendly Local VW FLAPS, 'cause it seemed
like that's what the Mallory preferred.  Granted I'm paying obscenely
high Los Angeles-area prices for by-crud gennie Cherman Bosch parts,
these two items set me back the better part of US$15 - approxi-squirtly
$10 for the condenser, and $5 for the points.  Now don't go waving yer
cheap Brazi-Bosch p&amp;c sets at me, I hear all of you wondering about
setting the dwell/do I &quot;really&quot; need a dwellmeter/OMG a dwellmeter is
the righteous bux, how to achieve the perfect dwell setting/OMG the
perfect dwell setting changed on me, crummy rubbing blocks going south
on cheap points sets, Bosch dizzy lube and where to find it, what
happens if my dizzy is in 180 off, blah-blah-blah, AND doing all the
cleaning and adjusting every X-thousand miles, blah-blah-blah...
Perhaps once long ago when good quality p&amp;c sets were relatively cheap
and plentiful, the p.r.c. may have been an extravagance reserved for the
upper classes, but judging from what some of you are writing WRT the
quality of sets these days, I really have to wonder how long before you
see p&amp;c sets in museums next to stuffed Dodos :-)

It's been so long since I've used points that I've forgotten EXACTLY how
often they are supposed to be replaced, but $15 for something that is
less than optimal, needs frequent
cleaning/filing/adjusting/hand-holding/baby-sitting, and THEN you gotta
throw it away every 10K miles or so, compared to a points replacement
conversion, the p.r.c. is looking REALLY good by now, doncha think?
Install it, set the timing (assuming you don't get one of the funky
Pertronix ones that fails before you get it set), check inside the cap
once in awhile to clean the rotor and cap contacts (but you do that
ANYWAY), and fuhgeddaboutit.  And yes, my Beloved Slaves to the Yoke of
Boss Kettering's Points, I DO keep a spare dizzy with either points
(gapped and set) or a p.r.c. on board already attached to the timing
clamp all set and ready to &quot;go to the hole&quot; in the event of something
terrible...

Happy nice weekend, y'all!
