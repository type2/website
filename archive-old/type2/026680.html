I carry a manual &quot;come along&quot; type winch in the van when needed hook it to
the tow ring under the front, have only needed it twice but when I did it
was a REALLY NEEDED IT!!!  Worked fine but it did take two folks or a
winch get in try to drive, get out winch some more etc.

I also carry a &quot;come along&quot; for this purpose.  Works great for just pulling
you out of mud/scree holes--obviously not something to get you across a wide
stream or anything like that.  Because you don't always have an anchor point
close by, I also carry a 50' tow rope which can be used to extend the &quot;come
along&quot; reach any length up to the full length of the rope, and a short
folding shovel available from military surplus stores.  A friend of mine
also carries a couple 4' pieces of 2x6s to make a little bridge for getting
over small holes without getting stuck in the first place.  He just stows
them in the back, but I was thinking it would be neat to rig a holding
bracket under the mid section of the van for them (I like to keep the inside
of my Westy real clean).
