Since I'm more of a pre-71 bus guy, I'm more curious if there are SS
exchangers for off a 956 maybe that might be coerced into fitting a 1600 VW
with stock heads/exhaust.  Has anyone dabbled in the black art of mixing
porsche parts with VW? ;). 
I don't think 956 drivers EVER had to worry about heat!!  Driving suits and nomex underwear usually do the trick!!

356 exchangers might fit, but I don't think so.

sorry for being a smart a_at__at_
