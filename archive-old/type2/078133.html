Subject: ahh bus fire again

hello all.

            I am fairly new at the bus scence but I am well aquainted with 
the bug scence. i have just completed hooking my engine(1700) back up in my 
westy and i went to start it on saturday and the thing backfired and fire 
started coming out of the intake(im running a weber progressive on it). well, 
i adjusted the timing on it and got the ol' bus running again. Went to start 
it this afternoon and it did the same thing again. fire shooting out the back 
of the intake somewhere. once again scared the crud out of me. got the fire 
out and there was no substantial damgae done. im thinking that since i don't 
have any exhaust on the bus right now that its backfiring because of that as 
i've had similar expierences with backfiring with my bug, but with no fire 
though. any suggestions? thanks a bunch for any responses! 

Fare thee Well-Evan
