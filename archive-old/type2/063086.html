If you call, talk to either Ron or Sherry Blattle, and mention the list
and my name, and they'll treat you right. As I recall, they were very
fairly priced, and overstocked with everything.


hmm seems to be a few differnet opinions out there!

would like anybody else's thoughts on Services Diversified.

FWIW i 'member reading in HVW a few years ago about a place in Colorado
that was supposed to have like 200 or 300 buses (lotsa  splits) that was
supposed to be _the largest_ (dunno if quantity equals quality) but
supposed they used the vans for storage and most of the good stuff had
already been grabbed :(
