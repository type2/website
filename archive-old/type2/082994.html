Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Depot T1 SS Exhaust

Adrian,
Let us know how easily it bolts up.  Fit is the main reason I am currently on 
the verge of scooping up one of Ron's German stocker kits.  I'll wait to hear 
from you!

BTW, BD's support people are working on an f'ed security patch from MS that is 
causing the site's difficulties...

&gt; I just received a parts order from Bus Depot placed by Snoopy for his engine
&gt; build.  Everything arrived nicely and in good order. 
&gt; 
&gt; Snoopy indicated previously that he got the SS muffler from Bus Depot.  I
&gt; had not seen one of these units before so of course I was curious as to the
&gt; quality of the build...  Let me just say that this system in very nice!  The
&gt; fit and finish are good and I am surprised Ron sells the kit at such a low
&gt; price, about $100.  (unfortunately it looks like the webpage is having
&gt; difficulties so I cannot access the PN)
&gt; 
&gt; The only beef I have with this setup is that the exit tube is metal (Dansk I
&gt; think) instead of SS.  Granted it is thick metal so it should be solid for a
&gt; long while before any rust through occurs.  That is the only thing holding
&gt; it back from being a &quot;lifetime&quot; muffler.  I did not check, but hopefully the
&gt; hardware kit that comes with it is SS stuff as well..?
&gt; 
&gt; Overall I highly recommend this part to anyone running a stock style
&gt; exhaust.
&gt;
