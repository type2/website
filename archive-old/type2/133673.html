Subject: Oh no! Now Sparkin ain't Startin

Okay,

The 74 micro now has a very sufficient spark after replacing the coil, wires,
plugs, condeser, cap, rotor, points, etc.... Yet, this dog dang blasted bus
still ain't startin?

It turns over great, timing is perfect, hot spark to the plugs, brand new
Weber system &amp; fuel pump...but nothing.

Can someone lend me some advice?  I'm begining to wonder if the new carb is at
fault?

Thanks,

Tom
