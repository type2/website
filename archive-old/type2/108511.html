Subject: Clutch Cable Adj.

While trying to follow Bentley's guidance, I've adjusted my clutch cable to
obtain smooth operation with no dragging. However, I had to tighten the
thing up pretty darn good, using pliers to turn the wing nut. The book says
there should actually be a bit of play between the wingnut and the actuating
arm...well I've got none of that.

Any looser and it gets hard to shift (dragging?).  All the parts looked good
and measured in spec befores assembly. Am I going to burn up my T/O bearing
with constant tension on the cable?

Thanks,
RickG 77 Westy &quot;Pumpkin II&quot;
