Subject: Re: [T2] FI ?? low fuel presure??

put new engine in my 78 2L FI won't start, ?? ran fine before swap...fired
right up.
  thru the check list and find I can only get about 12psi,!! huh was
consistently at 35psi before swap.

  pump runs, and I have a shut off valve so I could turn off the return
ring which takes the regulator out of the equation..  still only 12psi

  have a spare pump but before I go thru that hassle is there any other
checks to suggest... just don't understand why pump would suddenly fail.

plan on putting a hose on the ring where the presure guage is attached and
seeing if it will pump fuel or if the intake is blocked.

any other thoughts???  (other than blowing up this _at_#$&amp;$ bus.)

thanks
Bob
