Subject: Waving Friday

Me and the kids are avid wavers at any air-cooled we see, most buses wave
back and the majority of beetles but passengers who are not used to riding
with us get confused and embarassed.  One friend who travelled across
Scotland with me used to duck down behind the dashboard each time I waved,
surfers' salute is the usual method.  This was even though he had a VW,
albeit a 16 valve GTI.

Now though when he's driving on his own he feels this strange twitching in
his arm and is nearly drawn to wave.....man this thing sure does get to you.
