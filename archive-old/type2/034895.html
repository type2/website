Subject: Re: Anyone buy the Bus Depot Stainless Exhaust?

Just a note to report that I bought one of these, but I'm disappointed.
This is a heavy, nice-looking muffler, but the flange studs that connect
this to the heat exchangers weren't drilled quite straight. I don't
understand why this is such a problem with exhaust parts--I've seen it time
and time again. Don't the manufacturers know that straight studs are
critical to proper installation? To make matters worse, when I started
tightening down one of the lower bolts (not even torquing yet), the stud
came out of the flange side. Clearly, the threads in the flange hole were
damaged during manufacturing, otherwise the stud would not have come out.

I will be contacting Bus Depot for a replacement. (I've learned from
experience that there's no room to tap these holes bigger, at least not
with any of the tools I have available.) In fairness to BD, I'm reporting
to the list before discussing the problem them...and I'm sure they'll make
it right. 

Oh well, I've got an old extractor muffler to put on until I can get the
replacement...and you can't expect everything to go right on a new engine
install.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;
&gt;As I understand it, the exhaust fits the late model bus with the type 4 
&gt;engine.  I believe that only the outside of the muffler is stainless, the 
&gt;pipes are not.
&gt;
&gt;I'm used to running a less restrictive exhaust, and I'm a little concerned 
&gt;about the performance.  I'm also interested in the fit and finish, as I am 
&gt;tired of replacing gaskets on my poor fitting bugpack system.

 Thought for the SIG: &quot;What if suddenly, as we were tooling along, 
                       God turned to us for help; what if he needed 
                       /us/, for just a moment...or it would all 
                       fall apart?&quot; ...just a thought to ponder
