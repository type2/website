&gt; We are thinking about rebuilding our 2.0l, what can be done to make it
&gt; better, cam, heads, using 96mm pistons. We have dual dellorto 36mm which we
&gt; are looking to have rebuilt anyone know who does these. Should we use solid
&gt; or hydro lifters. Is there anyone in the Buffalo area that has done one or
&gt; can help. Do we need to line bore.

A good improvement for not much outlay is balancing.  You can get the crank
dynamically balanced along with the flywheel, clutch and fan as a unit.  You
can also balance the rods end for end and match the piston weights.  Then
there is volumetric balancing...

Solid lifters are probably 'better' as long as you keep them adjusted.
Hydraulics are low maintenance but give you increased wear on startup.

You shouldn't need to line bore a type 4 case.
