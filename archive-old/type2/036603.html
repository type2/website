Subject: Re: tire cover dimensions?

Keri -

It will depend on the dimensions of the spare tire. Say it's a 185/70*14,
which is a reasonably popular size, me thinks:

185 * .7 = 129.5mm from rim to pavement
Multiply by 2 (rim to top of tire!) = 259mm
14&quot; wheel * 25.4 = 355.6

355.6 + 259 = 614.6 mm diameter (24.2&quot;)
185 mm thickness (7.3&quot;)

Add a few percentage points for good looks, and I'd make it 25&quot; by 8&quot;.

Good luck!
