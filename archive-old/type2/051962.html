Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Bus Poll

Hello list,

I would have to say that my bus (1973 transporter) is
an a. It has a verry nice paint job, vw 1998 white on
top and 1999 yellow, used on the new beetle, on the
bottom. The problem is that the supurb paint job is
still in paint cans. Ok, by most people's standards,
my bus is a D. Give me time. A pair of good used doors
is soon to be on their way. and I plan to put a
refurbished AVP engine in it.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; i thought id throw a friday bus poll at everyone. 
&gt; something all of you can reply to, even those
&gt; lurkers
&gt; out there :)  the poll question is:
&gt; What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious
&gt; as
&gt; to how many out there are driving restored beauties
&gt; down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
&gt; drive?
&gt; 
&gt; A)Restored Example
&gt; 
&gt; B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
&gt; original nice condition)
&gt; 
&gt; C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
&gt; there or just a touch of rust)
&gt; 
&gt; D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
&gt; look at you funny when they see its not
&gt; abandoned-well
&gt; maybe not quite that bad:)
&gt; 
&gt; reply back to me and ill try and gather the results
&gt; and post back to the list.  so even those out there
&gt; who dont post often, reply back.  ill throw in the
&gt; first vote:
&gt; 1973 Riviera- D an excellent beater example:)
&gt; happy friday
