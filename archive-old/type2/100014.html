&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I am starting to plan a trip for next summer to do a 2nd honeymoon. We 
&gt; want
&gt; to drive from Charlotte NC to SO Cal, and back. Anyone have ideas for 
&gt; routes
&gt; and things to see on the way??
&gt; Should I go low through the Desert or high through the Plains?
&gt; any ideas would be great.
&gt; Thanks- Bryan
&gt;
Depends on when you travel and how you take the heat. It gets very hot 
during most of the summer. You should have gotten married later or 
earlier :=)

I would keep north. One hint I found helpful. If at any point you are 
desperate for an over-night place to stay, WalMart lets you stay in 
their parking lot, and they have security patrolling. Just stay away 
from the refrigerator 18 wheel rigs that keep their motors  running all 
night. For about $5.00 you can get one of these atlases in WalMart that 
have maps of all the states. Plus, more important, it has the location 
of all WalMarts. (There is a restroom inside on the left. Great for 
first thing in the morning or the middle of the night if it is a 24hr 
store.)
