Subject: ugh

i am the uber dweeb.

the #1 &amp; #2 wires were switched.

yes, i checked this countless times.

unfortunately I didn't check the whole LENGTH of the wire, just
the wire up to the fan housing mounted holder, in which i ALWAYS
put the #1 (and #3) wire in the top holder.

duh.

you would think after pointing this out to other people and doing it myself
other times, I would have learned.

pardon the waste of time and bandwidth, at least i learned a lot about related 
things in the interim.

thanks volks, hope you had a good weekend.
