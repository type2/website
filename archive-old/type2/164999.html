Man, when I drive my VW Bus, I find myself CONSTANTLY looking in the 
rear-view mirrors to see how badly I'm holding someone up. I feel bad, so 
I'm constantly looking and then find myself almost flooring it just so I 
don't inconvenience anyone. I really enjoy driving the VW Bus, but it's so 
difficult for me to get into that mindset. The majority of my other cars are 
all slightly modified and break into the 14s or better. So going from 
something like that, to the VW Bus really REALLY takes some effort on my 
part.

What I find odd though, is that... yeah, the VW Bus is slow. But... it's a 
VW Bus, so people should be aware of it. It's such an iconic vehicle that 
people should at least know a few basics. But I still get multiple people 
pulling up behind me at a light (when there are plenty of other lanes) and 
then they ride my ass when the light turns green. I mean... I'm like... 
dude, I'm FLOORING IT, what else do you want me to do?

&gt; Driving at 55/60 mph isn't being an old fuddy duddy!  I challenge anyone 
&gt; to
&gt; have sat in on one of my physics classes when I go over accel/velocity vs
&gt; force lessons and not become much more aware of the real dangers of excess
&gt; speed.
&gt;
&gt; It can be done, all it takes is less pressure on the gas pedal and a more
&gt; laid back outlook on life.
