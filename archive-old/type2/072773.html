Check the individual contacts on the AFM plug.  Sometimes they rattle out
of the plug socket and don't contact or contact intermittantly (I have
recent experience).  Unplug it from the AFM and inspect if all contacts are
projecting from plug.  If not, carefully peel back cover and push contacts
back up in plug.


Also have you checked your fuel filter lately?  I keep a see-through one in
front of the bosch one to tell if the tank is gunking up the fuel.

Have fun

&gt;Got a f.i. bus, '78 2.0, all stock..here is the problem.  this is
&gt;intermittent.  I drive down the street no problem but when you go around a
&gt;corner( and this is only about 30% of the time) the car will die and won't
&gt;start, usually for about 20 to 30 minutes, then it starts right up.  my
&gt;first thought is that their is something in the tank that is getting suck to
&gt;the fuel outlet, then held by pressure from the line and after sitting and
&gt;the pressure releases, it floats away.  I don't know if this is the reason
&gt;but I can't think of anything else.  Any help would be most appreciated as
&gt;their is a safety issue going through intersections while turning and it is
&gt;a royal pain in my As* to be stuck there.  Help!
