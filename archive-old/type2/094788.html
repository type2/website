Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

Bob Hoover mentions this in one of his sermons, but I can't remember which 
one right now. They pleaded guilty, paid the small fine and the case 
couldn't be reopened.

&gt;I had heard a number of times that General Motors actually bought up all
&gt;the cable-car and trolleys in the US and ripped up the tracks -
&gt;specifically to encourage people to buy cars. But I can't find any
&gt;supporting info on the web right now... Plenty of info on the cable car
&gt;tracks being paved over in San Francisco.
