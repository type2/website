Volks,

I am not the most experienced welder in the world, but when I worked on =
the steel yard, only had to weld 1/4&quot; and up not thin body metal, so =
bear with me. =20

If anyone uses this sort of machine on their bus, can you give me a =
baseline?  I am running .22ga wire..........on sheet metal.....I have =
fooled with it on some scrap and either i burn thru or get popcorn.
