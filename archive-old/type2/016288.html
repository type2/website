&gt; In this case you should do as VW did on the late T2 deluxe micro busses and
&gt; add a
&gt; substansial L shaped bracket into the corner between the door pillar and the
&gt; seat pedestal.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck

Or on a Late bay ('78 and '79), it's a not so substantial triangular piece that
extends up the door post from the seat pedestal only about 3 inches.

- I removed my bulkhead on a '75 to fit the rotating seat, and still haven't
quite got around to putting this triangular piece in. - but it SHOULD be done
(or VW wouldn't have done it, right?)
