Harmon,
that's exactly what I think. After 21 years with my  '58 split (now with
it's 5th 1200 engine in 130.000 km)
that nowadys is my vintage toy, I really would not want to change my '77 2.0
type IV engined westy back to a Type 1 engine.
With our strong traffic on german autobahns I would not like to miss one hp.
The only reason why I changed the engine against another 2.0 3 years ago at
196.000 km was that I could get
held of a brand new VW-engine very very cheap. Just precaution.
The old engine still lives in a friends Type 3 variant and is still running
strong.
The Type 1s always had to be changed.

I'd rather convert with a watercooled Audi engine than going back to a Type
1 - and I really love the aircooled way to drive.

Best wishes,
Michael Meier
Braunschweig, Germany
