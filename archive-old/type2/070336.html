Busses by the Arch is a fantastic, friendly camping event held twice
a year near St. Louis MO. The next one is over the Labor Day
Weekend, August 30-Sept 1. Bill Bowman, who organizes BBTA, asked me to
post some information, details and directions to the campground, so I
put some stuff up on my home VW page,
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm with links to more.


If you come to BBA, please stop by and say hello and enjoy a manhattan.  =
we will be the group with the 50's theme camping setup,  carpet, ugly =
lamps, furniture, etc.  we will be bringing a 87syncro, 67 kombi,67 =
double cab, 78 westy

hope to see you there
