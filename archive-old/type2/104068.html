Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is tired

I use my '70 as a daily driver and I put about 2500 miles a month on her. So
don't let others tell you your bus is too old, instead make sure she is well
cared for and you'll be fine.
I just had to replace the fuel pump. She would do fine in town, but try to
run 60 and she could act like she was out of gas (tired maybe?).
Later,
