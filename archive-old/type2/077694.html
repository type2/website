&gt; Rather than using an old washing machine part that's made of plastic and
&gt; has rubber seals that probably won't live in fuel, get yourself to the
&gt; local boneyard and grab the electric fuel tank selector valve off any
&gt; mid '70's Chevy or GMC pick-um-up.  Made for the purpose, probably cost
&gt; all of five bucks.  Cap off the two pipes that you won't be using with
&gt; neoprene slip on caps available from your local NAPA.  Plumb it so that
&gt; you're using the side of the selector that requires power to open. Bolt
&gt; it on and run a wire.
