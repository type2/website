 the guy didn't realize what kinda files he was loading - big deal.    I
 recall that not that long ago Clara was resigning from the list, if I recall
 correctly, because of some insults by a couple of AH's.  I recall a similar
(snip)

Er, though the timing was close, actually I left the list because I became a 
student with an amazing workload.  New quarter started today.  Yay biochem 
yay!  I prefer sleeping to reading bus list, so I will be leaving again soon.

Just recently got a digital camera and am learning this webpage stuff a 
little bit.   Now I can appreciate a lot more what goes into putting these 
together.  I am not sure than I know what I am doing.   Took some pics of  
the carb icing of a splitty-  ran it without preheat tube attached and took a 
pic of it iced, then attached the tube, and watched it de ice and took a pic 
of it half way and then another deiced,   Also pic of the 67 combis og 67 
style preheat system.  well, the tin around front of the fan housing, really 
hard to get the right angle to get a pic of it.  I can send pics if anyone is 
interested.

  I even managed to get the pics into my computer from the camera, a major 
acheivment. I want to put something together where I can have pics on a web 
page, and I am sure it'll be crude, but who else has carb icing, various 
aircleaner, thermostat pics on a webpage?  FWIW, colour does not come out at 
all original on the digicam.

Carb icing website may be coming soon.  or maybe not so soon.
