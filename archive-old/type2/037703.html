Wes,
You might approach the problem in this way. Assuming that the engine ran 
well when the starter failed 5 months ago, what could have changed in the 
meantime? On the ignition side you might have built up some corrosion on the 
points which would cause a miss. So take a fine ignition file and clean the 
surfaces lightly, not enought to change the gap or timing. On the fuel side, 
the choke butterfly and associated mechanism might have also gotten dry and 
sticky which would cause the fuel mixture to be too rich after it warmed up, 
and thus explain the fumes. Check the choke mechanism when the engine is 
warm to make sure the choke butterfly is full open. Another possibility is 
the float in the carburetor may have dropped down in its bowl due to fuel 
evaporation and become mechanically bound up and then failed to float up and 
turn off the incoming fuel when the chamber re-filled, thus causing a rich 
mixture. You could take off the top of the carb and make sure that the gas 
level in the bowl is as it is supposed to be, measured from the edge of the 
bowl to the surface of the fuel. Those are the things that you might 
investigate that might have happened in the interim. I didn't understand 
what drain plug you pulled to look for gunk?
