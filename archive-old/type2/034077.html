Subject: Virgin at pulling engine.

My first time.  Final exams done and there was a little free time, so I
spent yesterday morning under the bus, disconnecting this and that, removing
nuts and bolts hither and yon (hint:  wear a proper pair of coveralls, so
your bus may be fooled into thinking you are a real mechanic).  Surprisingly
it only took about an hour to get most of the stuff disconnected (72 bus
with 78 2-L, Weber/Holley 2bbl single carb).

Got everything loose, grab engine, pull it toward me.  Nothin.  It's like
it's still bolted into place.  Uh...it IS still bolted in place.  Hadn't
removed the upper engine mounting nuts.  Remove 'em, try again.  Now it
comes toward me...but not very far.  A piece of tin in the way.  Remove it.
Once more, into the breach.  Engine comes almost all the way out.  The lower
mounting studs lack about 3/4&quot; of being out.  But I can't get the engine out
any farther as the fan housing is touching the rear apron.  And the 72 is
the model w/o the removable rear apron...  :-p

I guess the difficulty is arising because this bus warn't designed for this
engine.  Anyway, I was thinking of shoving a little jack in there somewhere
(taking care to locate the jack points properly) to jack the engine away
from the transmission housing until the studs clear.  Is this an ok idea,
merely a bad idea, or maybe a Real Bad Idea?

And while I'm at it...would I be ostracized for wanting to saw out the rear
apron and re-mount it with bolts 'n' nuts, so as to avoid this problem in
the future?
