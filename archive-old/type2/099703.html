Subject: Re: [T2] engine number confusion

I think I'm agreeing with Karl...the following came from a contradictory 
post in the library under &quot;year and identification changes&quot;: (credit to 
Josh Rodgers)
maybe I should just not wonder, except and love the engine as is, and move 
forward.


1979 Chassis# 219 2153 964 (July) Engine# GE 0 055786
2000cc, 72hp, AFC Fuel injection
Remarks:
(a)Last year of the beloved Baywindow.
(b)Vanagon starts Aug. 1979.
(c)Hydraulic lifters.

&gt;I am not sure where someone came up with the idea that GE is a 1979 California
&gt;engine. I have seen that at 2 places. It is totally wrong. GE means it has
&gt;hydraulic lifters. Hydraulic lifters came out in 1978. These are all GE
&gt;engines, along with all USA 79 engines. I know one of the places that shows
&gt;this false info is here:   http://tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm
