Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy

I also agree that this particular van is doubtfully worth 16K, but remember
this, just because something, anything, has a certain price, doesn't mean it
is worth it.

A lot of these replies say spend the money on something solid and fix it up,
with money to spare.  I agree with that also, but money is only half of it.
Remember the rest of the advice, check out the whole car in great detail.

Saw a 73 Westy years ago with $13000 for a pricetag at some skanky used car
lot.  Had a regular roof with a chrome rail forward of the poptop, instead
of the moulded tub to finish off the roof.  Salesman said, &quot;not much rust,
and what a rare van with that chrome rail.  We are practically giving it
away!&quot;  Also, not too long ago we pretty much decided here that a Bus priced
at 17K at the ritzy place on the north side of Atlanta(can't remember the
name)  was rather rediculous.

At this point in time, Busses need (and deserve) lots of attention even
BEFORE you purchase them.  Do the homework.
