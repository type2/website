Subject: fuel smell, flat spot.

well just got the kreeper back together-had a fuel smell in the exhaust
and it had a flat spot-009 34 pict-3 thing. anyway - i had checked all
the particulars in the carb and everything checked out. while i had it
apart, i changed the main jet to a 130 from a 127.5. i also reamed the
accelerator pump a few sizes and set the adjustment back in the middle
of the adjuster. hooked up the tach and set the idle mixture and idle
speed screw per bentley-wife said no fuel smell this time-time for road
test! wow what a difference off the bottom end! no flat spot and just
about snaps my head back in my seat! :-) well not really, but it does
accelerate much better now than ever before in the 700 miles since
rebuild. thanks to the list for the help....and thanks to karl for the
hoover piece he sent me a while back. he very quietly mailed it to me
with no request for $ not even for shipping. ok wasnt that expensive to
mail but it was the thought that counted. karl doesnt know me from the
next guy on the street but he helped me find the impossible part in my
eyes. karl, i admire you for silently helping out your fellow
bussers-brian and the kreeper
