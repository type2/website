Subject: fuel line size

I have been trying to find a piece of fuel line for my 78 bus. It's the
line between the pump and the filter. I think it's 10mm but I am not
sure. I called the local VW dealer and they don't know the size or have
it.(usual thing they always say to me). Could someone tell me
what size this is? I tried going to all local stores with the filter and
no one had anything that fit.  I want to call some shops further away
and see if they have it. Thanks.
