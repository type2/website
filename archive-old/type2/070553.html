Subject: Thanks, 34 mm vs 33 mm valve questions.
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Thanks to all for the advice and stories.

I have decided to strip the heads and go back with all-new valve train. The 
intakes look and measure nearly as new, but since I can move these heads over 
to the 2.0 FI when that engine is finished, the security of new heads right 
now is worth the investment.

Thanks again.
