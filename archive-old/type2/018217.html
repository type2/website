           I have to agree with Bill, and add this: The engine really
needs something that flows quickly and easily at low temps (truckers,
for instance, even use an electric oil pump to get the oil flowing
before even starting, to lengthen engine life), and air-cooled engines
run much hotter than water-cooled, even in winter.
         Even better than multigrade dyno-oil is syn-oil.
