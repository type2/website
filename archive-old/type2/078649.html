Subject: Re: [T2] # 1 EXHAUST VALVE SINKING

When you know what you are doing, and when the bolts involved are clean and 
easy to remove, the whole pull-job can take less than 30 minutes.

We used to pull the engines in our Beetles in under 20 minutes. One friend 
removing wires and cables, me removing the bolts and nuts.

Then we'd pull the engine - allowing it to fall about 1/2&quot; onto wooden 
blocks and then 3 of us would push the car up on two wheels and roll it 
forward.

Installation wasn't as slick - requiring jacks and such.

The bus pull is easy, can be done alone, but I would suggest the help of a 
friend.

Earlier models are easier than late models.

Which model is yours?

The short version is: jack under the engine, disconnect the wiring, 
disconnect the heater cables, disconnect the throttle, disconnect the fuel 
line, remove 4 bolts/nuts on the transmission to engine joint.

If yours is an early model you can remove the bumper and apron and simply 
roll the van forward leaving the engine behind sitting on blocks.

If yours is a late, it will require more maneuvering to get the engine out 
as you cannot get the bumper and apron off of these models.

Your solutions are: Buy Muir's Idiot book (very good basic explanations) 
and a MUST have (even before Muir) is the Bentley book, skip the Haynes 
book. A visit from a VW experienced friend or a visit to a local mechanic 
to watch a VW engine pull.

P-mail me if you need or want any more clarification.


&gt;My thrust bearing is also making noises and slipping so it would be good to
&gt;do
&gt;that at the same time, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance

Your thrust bearing may be howling but it is not slipping like a clutch. I 
had a van which ate 3 quickly because one of the arms had weakened and that 
allowed the bearing to get off center. They'd last about 5 miles.

Another possibility is that the throw-out bearing arm is drifting left or 
right and doing the same damage.


Ciao!
