Subject: Peregrine makes the grade

I took Peregrine down to the desert today, enjoyed some warm air, and 
then turned her around to see if she would push up the grade that killed 
her back in April.

She did just fine. At the worst point (about 10 miles at 6% to 7% grade) 
she climbed at 40 mph/3K rpm. The oil temperature climbed to 250F and 
then nosed over, but stayed put. The temperature dropped as soon as the 
grade was more mild, and dropped below 200F on the down side.

On the flat, she runs at a nice, calm 215-220F (2.0L/FI). 

I'm inclined to find these temps acceptable. I am running Castrol 
synth/blend, and I imagine I will do oil changes on the order of every 
1500 miles. 

So I think she's ready to head out to Aridzona as soon as the Y2K 
silliness passes.
