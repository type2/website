Hello all,
I know I said I would remain on the list, but unfortunately time 
constraints dictate that I unsubscribe, at least for a little while.

I can/will still read the list from the daily archive site.  Also, my 
tech site will remain up and operational.  I hope it continues to 
provide help to everyone, I just checked it out today and there are over 
12,000 hits since I put the counter on last September.
