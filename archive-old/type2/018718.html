&gt; &gt; it back on. But the thing leaks oil very badly. Did I do something wrong

I also recently put a temp sender in my sump plate.  I used a light amount of
permatex high temp RTV silicone around the sensor and used the rubber O-ring
gasket (with no sealer) on the sump plate.  Works great, no leaks at all.
