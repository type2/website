Subject: still more on my broken longblock

i took a look at my old engine, which i haven't returned yet, and it has a
woodruff key still in the crankshaft. Now I know I especially careful to put
everything on the new engine the way it came off the old, which makes me
think that AVP put a woodruff key in the block they sent me. there had to
have been a woodruff key or else the key slot would not be so chewed up,
right? (I hope)

has anyone gotten a longblock from AVP recently?? do you remember if there
was a woodruff key already in the crank when you got it??

of course, if not, then i'm even further up that creek, eh?

thanks y'all for the rapid responses!
