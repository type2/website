Do you have a built in cooler in your type 2 bay window camper (RBC)?

Do you occasionally fill it with ice and brew ??

After a while, the ice become white water, and the brew becomes yellow 
water, and you have to get rid of both.

My favorite way to get rid of the white water is initially place a large, 
heavy plastic bag in the built in cooler, then add the ice and brew.

When all the brew is gone, I simply pull the water filled bag out of the 
built in cooler and dump it.  Quick, easy, and I can do it even without 
thinking!!

(I am still working on the yellow water problem....)
