Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust stud FART

With regard to the wax extraction method, I've used it
several times and never had it fail. It's simple- take
your torch, focus the flame on the stud, get it really
hot (like almost glowing), then take a stick of
parafin (like they use in canning, available at your
local grocery store) and cram it on the smoldering
stud, being ware that you are not directly underneath
the application area. Capillary action will suck the
wax deep into the rusted threads and greatly ease the
studs removal.

&gt; beautiful green and white bus. But I wasn't there to
&gt; drool. I needed
&gt; to see if we could get the inboard #3 exh stud out.
