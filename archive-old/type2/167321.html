Subject: weird oil cooler

Hi Volks,

Someone sent me a link today wherein I saw the strangest oil cooler  
setup I have ever come across:
http://photos.imageevent_dot_com/mrokrasa/flat4s36hpokrasaengine//Complete 
%2036hp%20Okrasa%20rear%203-4%20view.jpg

or http://tinyurl_dot_com/25yv8r

Now, is it just me or is this thing going to require major oil  
pressure to keep oil flowing through it with all the bends and drag  
from the tubing?

But even when you find a way to keep the pressure up; the heat from  
the oil is going directly into the stream of air used to cool the  
engine. Which will make the oil even hotter....

I think someone wasn't thinking clearly when they designed this.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
