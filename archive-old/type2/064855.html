&gt; So do I.  Or rather, I hate not having really good brakes.  One thing I've
&gt; thought of doing is removing the proportioning valve.  This valve limits
&gt; the braking ability of the rear brakes to approximately half of the front.
&gt; 

DO NOT REMOVE THE PROPORTIONING VALVE!!!!!!!!!!!
It serves a very useful purpose! IT IS SUPPOSE TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF FORCE!
How close to the limit before the rears lockup is what you might want to 
find out, but you always use a proportioning valve, always!!!! You adjust 
a proportioning valve and then apply the brakes, HARD, until the rears 
just start to lock up. Then you back off or rather, cut off some of the 
force to the rear brakes. The factory might have this set up fairly 
conservative, but do not try it w/o a valve. If you must play around with 
it, try an aftermarket valve from wilwood racing, its about $60 (US)
I do not know if the prop valve on the VW bus is adjustable, most factory 
valves are preset at the factory.

Whether or not th rears lock up has nothing to do with the amount of 
weight over each wheel on your bus. It is a matter of physics and weight 
transfer. Even big Semi s have prop valves of some sort.

MY 2 cents

&gt; Now, I know there will be a few of you who will say, &quot;Don't do this!!!!
&gt; It's dangerous, the rear brakes will lock up and you'll spin out!&quot; but the
&gt; my bus has 1100 pounds over each rear wheel and even with some major weight
&gt; transfer I don't think the rears will lock up.  Ever.  One of these days
&gt; I'm gonna try it.
&gt; Or, I may put in an adjustable proportioning valve.  These are only about
&gt; $40 and have a high coolness-factor.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also gonna see if they list Performance Friction Carbon metallic pads
&gt; and shoes over at Auto Zone.  I have these on the Mustang, and they are
&gt; great.  If they stock them for the bus, I might just have to celebrate.
