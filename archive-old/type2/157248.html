Subject: Re: [T2] Testing a Fuel Injection harness??

Are you sure you aren't supposed to go to the plug to
the resister pack??

 Hi all:
 
 I got a fuel injection harness to replace the one
 that was destroyed in an 
 engine fire.  (Air-cooled Federal Vanagon.)  I
 figured I'd do some testing 
 of the harness before going any further with it, but
 I'm stumped right at 
 the get-go and I'm wondering if there's something
 here I don't understand.
 
 I first tested the wire that connects to the
 ignition coil; a continuity 
 tester (test light and a battery) attached to the
 wire's spade connector at 
 one end and terminal 1 of the big black ECU
 connector (as indicated in the 
 wiring diagram) at the other end lit up.  Cool! 
 It's a good wire.
 
 I then went on to test the 4 fuel injection
 connectors and here's where I 
 got stumped.  Looking at the wiring diagram, one of
 the two wires at each 
 fuel injector connector runs to a terminal in the
 ECU connector and the 
 other wire runs to the white plug that attaches to
 the right side of the 
 dual relay.  In each case I registered continuity
 between one terminal of 
 the connector and the appropriate terminal in the
 ECU connector.  But, when 
 I went to do the test with the other wire in each of
 the fuel injection 
 connectors I got no indication of continuity at the
 white dual relay plug.
 
 The harness certainly *looks* OK and it's only an
 overabundance of caution 
 that persuaded me to test it in the first place. 
 According to my reading of 
 the wiring diagram I should be showing continuity
 between the FI connectors 
 and the white dual relay plug, but I'm not.  Do I
 have a bad harness here, 
 or am I missing something in my reading of the
 diagram?
