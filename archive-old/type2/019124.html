To take the faucet/pump mechanism out remove the two screws on top that hold the
body of the faucet to the sink, then remove the hose that is attached to the
bottom of the pump.  It should then lift right out.  On my 72 I can reach the
hose that attaches to the bottom of the pump by taking the passenger seat out and
reaching into the space under the sink.
