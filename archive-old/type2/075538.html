Subject: [T2] Coils

&quot;I've had 3 coils fail on me in the past 5 years from 3 different buses.
These were all Bosch blue coils manufactured wherever in whatever country.
Is there a &quot;better&quot; coil out there? Oil filled? Other dielectric use
internally? &quot;

Yes, it is the old German made stock black coil.  Get one for peanuts at a
local junkyard near you :)  Never had one fail personally, but they do die
eventually just much longer lasting than the &quot;new&quot; stuff.
