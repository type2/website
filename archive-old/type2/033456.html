Subject: Re: Rocket arm threads stripped on cyl head

&gt;I removed my valve covers yesterday to pin down the source of a ticking
&gt;sound in my '81 stock california vanagon.  I decided to re-torque my rocker
&gt;arm shafts then adjust the valves according to bentley.  Anyway, I
&gt;discovered that two rocker arm bolts have apparantly stripped the cylinder
&gt;head threads.  #1 and #2 each have one bolt that will only torque to about

assuming you mean the threads on the studs, the studs screw right out, this
is my guess as the relatively fine M7 is often stripped, fairly impossible for the
hefty M10 or whatever thread down in the head to go even though it is in
aluminum.

If you need studs, junkyard head or I'd be happy to send a couple.
