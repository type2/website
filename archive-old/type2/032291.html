Subject: Type 3 Engine question...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0012090009010.666-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;

I'm putting the final touches on my Type 3 engine that is gonna go into my
'74 Westy. I have a question, and I would greatly appreciate any help from
anyone who has experience with these engines. I read somewhere (Maybe on
this list) that the distributor shaft *doesn't* set perpendiuar to the
seam in the crankcase in these engines like type 1 1600's. When I first
got a look at it, it was pointing right between #1 and #2 cylinders. I
read it was supposed to point at #1. (?) This engine seems to be identical
to most type 1's with a few exceptions, mainly the fan system, this being 
the type 3 pankake (1600 DP, stock dual carbs). 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

After much research I'm still foggy about what vehicle this engine
came out of ...starts with TO.... my best guess is an early '67 ghia,
one of the last stock carb models but Ive been told many different things.
