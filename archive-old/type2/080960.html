Subject: Re: [T2] Where to get fuel tank??

Steve Dolan said:
&gt; HOWEVER....  The major difference between the early and late tanks is the
&gt; fuel outlet.  The '67-71 is set up for carbs and have one outlet and an
&gt; internal strainer.  The late tanks have two outlets for the FI and no
&gt; strainer.

Mostly, I know for a fact the 73 only has one outlet for fuel on the bottom.  And 3 on top
for venting.    So is there any differences between the early bays and 72-74 bays tanks?
