The muffler you have is a bug muffler and is preferred by many. It is
cheaper and I think has better qualities than the single pipe version.

OK folks, while my engine is out for the gas tank repair, I am also going
to replace my muffer on the 71 westy (1600 DP).  The current muffler on it
is the one with 2 exhaust outlets (pea shooter?).  Looking through parts
catalogs, I see that all the bus mufflers for a 71 have just the 1 exhaust
outlet.  So, do I currently have a Bug muffler? If so, are there any
reasons I should NOT replace it with a new Bug muffler of the same style or
would I be much better off going with the proper single exhaust bus
muffler.  The version I currently have seems to be considerably cheaper, so
that's one advantage of the 2 exhaust version.  All opinions appreciated!
