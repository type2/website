&gt;  I hope that this technology isn't 25 years off- I think it might be

&gt; [...]
&gt;  What I think is workable, given a bit more progress in fuel cells,
&gt; is to replace the bus drivetrain with a dedicated electric system-
&gt; the gearbox would be replaced by an electric motor (say, 75KW), the
&gt; engine by the fuel cell (~50KW) and seperator and the fuel tank
&gt; would stay where it is. Probably there should be a small battery
&gt; pack which would be charged by regenerative braking and would
&gt; provide a little additional power to supplement the fuel cell for
&gt; hills and acceleration.

25+ years!!!!
The technology is here now and completly functional.  The only thing that is
lacking is the hydrogen distribution system.

I'm one of the organizers of a little event that runs each year called The City of
Los Angeles Marathon
( http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/kn6f.html )
For the last five or so years, Honda has been the major sponsor.  Each year at the
runners expo, honda has put on a mini car show, showcasing their concept vehicles,
Last year was the Insight, this year was their Fuel Cell powered vehicle.

The fuel cell is a 60KW device and it just worked as advertised.  The car was a
four seater but the 3000-5000 psi fuel tank took up the trunk area. (hatchback).
The car lead the marathon and performed flawlessly over the route.

The car is being developed by Honda and a group called the California Alternative
Fuels Consortium.

It is envisioned that in the next couple of years that the fuel cells will be put
to use in commercial buildings for self powered buildings (ease of fuel delivery).

Once the delivery mechanism is figured out and put into place, the fuel cells
would move into cars.

With California's electric vehicle mandate that they are not backing down from,
expect this to be sooner than later.  A 300 mile range on a tank, reduces the
initial distribution requirements.  Remember when the only place you could find
diesel was at truck stops?

Now what the hell does all this have to do with a bus?  I'm watching this with a
close eye and will be one of the first to drop a fuel cell into my '60 DC and
convert it over to electric power.  Once the distribution system starts showing
up, I'm going to start looking at it real hard.  I know I'll loose some power
output giving up the 2L type IV, but for trips to Home Depot and general light
hauling that I use the truck for, I figure why not.

Keep those eyes open

Scott
