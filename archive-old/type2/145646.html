Subject: Strap holder behind passenger seat

My 1972 Bus has a hook and rubber strap on the bulkhead behind the passenger seat.  I can not find anyone who knows what it was for.  My Owners Manual does not show it and I can not find a picture of it anywhere that shows what it was used for.

It was suggested that it held the tool roll, but my Owners Manual shows that stored with the jack under the passenger seat.

Any ideas?

Also, thanks to Busted Bus for additional parts like it to install behind the drivers seat.
