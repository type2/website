Subject: do it yourself painting trick number 117.

&gt;... Rub all the rubber with a good rubber cleaner, so the tape will stick (if
&gt;you know how, use some good tape, such as 3M, and mask off everything,
&gt;including the rubber).

If you decide to leave the windows in while painting, a good trick is to
take a string and lay it in under the outer edge of the rubber. Then mask
the rubber and window. If you can follow me, this allows you to paint just
under the rubber trim. Subsequently when you're all done and remove the
string, the rubber will now lay over the painter part. This gives a nice
clean finish, without those tell tale stains of paint on the rubber.
