Subject: RE: electrical mess - 65 camper (long)

&gt;either i can get a 67 unit to put it, though i am told it wont fit well because
&gt;of frame differences (?)  or use the new pivots found in an old vw shop .

I believe that '65 is the same as '67.  I used to have a '65 and the wiper
assembly was the same as the '66 that I had in high school.  It was very easy to
find a 12V motor for the '65 when I did the conversion to 12V (I used one from a
Karmann Ghia and repositioned the drive arm so the wipers would stop in the
right place).  

When I bought my present '64, the PO had not quite finished the 12V conversion,
so the wipers still needed to be changed to 12V.  I blindly assumed (never
assume) that the '64 was the same as the wiper assemblies that I had been so
intimate with on my previous busses, so went to a junk yard and pulled the first
assembly I found, without looking at the year, or checking out mine or a '64 in
the yard.

When I got home and got the dash apart, I discovered that the '64 was set up
with the motor mounted between the heater defogger &quot;Y&quot;, and the connecting links
had ball connections on the end, rather than being the one piece assembly I was
holding in my hand.  I sized it up and determined that it should fit anyway, and
proceeded to try to wrench the new unit into place.  The problems encountered
were that the opening in the heater &quot;Y&quot; was not large enough for the new motor,
and the dash pan didn't have the clearance bend in the front (FIF) where the
wiper assembly was mounted.  Cursing severly and with the knowledge that no
other person would be cursing me as the PO (I have never sold a car in my life,
except to junk yards, after stripping them - another story), I got out the
sledge hammer and proceeded to provide clearance for the new assembly.  Though
it is not the cleanest installation, the advantage is that the new motor will be
a 2 speed when I get around to changing the switch and wiring, and that
replacement parts are easier to find, since they are from a later model and have
similarities to other models.

What all this is getting to is that you should have no problem fitting an
assembly from a later splittie into your '65, but make sure they look the same
first (never assume).  The other thing is that you can also use parts from yours
and the other unit to make one working assembly (the hardest part here is
getting the little wire circlip off the outside end of the wiper drive arm, if
you want to take it out and clean and lubricate it.

Have fun and remember, electricity is your friend,
