Subject: My Westie is an RV?

Hey all,

I just found out the Nat'l Park Service considers my Westie an RV when I =
have the pop up.   Went camping this past weekend in Lassen Nat'l Park =
in northern California.  Six of us went up in three different vehicles.  =
Only spot open was in the tent only area of the campground.  This was =
okay  as everyone but me was using tents.  Ranger comes by and says we =
can only have two vehicles parked at the site.  OK, we move one of the =
vehicles.  Then he mentions we are in a tent only area and I can't park =
my &quot;RV&quot; there.  So's I ask him if it's okay to park with the top down.  =
He says that would be fine.  Slept just fine with the top down, bonking =
head once or twice when changing clothes.

Gotta be careful where you park those &quot;RV's&quot;.  The trip was great and =
the Westie worked fine.  Met a ranger at the base of Mt. Lassen who owns =
an '82 Westie so talked VW's for a bit before climbing the mountain.
