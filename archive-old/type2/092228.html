Subject: Newfoundland Trip

We are planning a trip to Newfoundland in the next few weeks. Will be
leaving the Ottawa area of Ontario and touring through Quebec, New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, then on to Newfoundland. Would appreciate
hearing from list members about  their experiences touring these
locations. Places to see, camp, avoid? Of course the location of VW
Repair shops along the way, just in case, you know. We will be traveling
in our 1982 air-cooled Westy. Certainly appreciate any information
relating to this trip. Thanks....
