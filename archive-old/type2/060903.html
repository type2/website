Subject: Re: reason for being under-powered?

&gt;Hi Volks!
&gt;Those of us w/older t2s have to deal w/them being under powered.Has 
anyone ever researched why they were made that way in the first 
place?Were the vw designers of the 60's and 70's insane when they put 
such small engines in such big vehicles, or was this some kind of cruel 
joke? You would think that a company w/the same origins as Porsche and a 
country w/ the autobahn as their highway system would have produced 
faster cars.Does anyone know why this is,or know of any web sites that 
discuss it?

These were ment to be a cheap car for the people and were made to save 
money. If you had a lot of money and wanted speed, you got a Mercedes or 
BMW not a VW. It was not till the 70's that the cars finally came with 
power as an option. This is not fact, just opinion and insights from 
reading.
