&gt; Al has a good point about it getting titled incorrectly from the

&gt; buses were in and the dealer did it for loan purposes.

my title has mine listed as a 77 and the bill of sale says it's a 77, but
the serial number and birth certificate all say it is a 78,,somewhere
along the line the motor vehicles folks switched it, early registrations
had it as a 77, but now it is registered as a 78, I didn't do anything??  
the serial number on all of these documents though is the same...?!?
