Subject: RE: [T2] Bay windshield question (&amp; perhaps a free windshield
  for someone.)

&gt;From: &quot;David Bernstein&quot;

&gt;So would anyone attempt to put the old, yellowed all around the edges 
&gt;(about
&gt;2&quot; of such) w/ 5 or 6 small dings and cracks back into the bus after I do a
&gt;thorough windshield lip cleaning and restoration?  Especially when I have 
&gt;the
&gt;$ to purchase a new one (Tallahassee local company - Mobile Auto Glass -
&gt;installed in my driveway for $219.00 - (already own the new seal)

Depends on far you are going to restore the windsheild channel. I myself 
have to do this soon. My winsheild is a real shi$%er. It would not pass 
inspection and I suspect after it comes out it will not go back it. It has 
been hit with several rocks, just not busted through. If you see a paint job 
in the near future I would wait for the new one and do it after the paint 
job. If it is a safety/visibility issue then go for new.
