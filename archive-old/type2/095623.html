Subject: RE: [T2] floor pan replacement and part question

&gt; In both the driver and passenger sides, where one's feet go
&gt; - what I would call a floor floor pan, I can see daylight -
&gt; it has rusted through and needs to be replaced...
&gt; The Bus Depot has what they  call &quot;Belly Pan, Under Front
&gt; Cab Area, 68-79 Bus&quot;    Is this what I need?


No. You need our part number 84381 and 84382, for $19.95 each. These are the
front floor sections for the drivers and passengers side, respectively, just
in front of the front seats.
