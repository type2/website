&gt;Also, if you remove the steering wheel is there supposed to be a spring 
&gt;directly under it?  This seems really odd to me.
&gt;Please reply via e-mail if possible.

Under that spring is a thin metal forcing cone that holds the steering
shaft centered in the upper shaft bearing. The spring is there to prevent
this cone from working loose. I pulled one of these apart a few days ago.
This one had all the appearance of original parts not disassembled since
new. Original switches, perfect un-chipped horn pad to seriously mated
shaft and bearing with the above mentioned forcing cone. 

Trying several techs to get a purchase on this sucker and apply enough
force to pop it out of there with no success, I BulleyTeched it with a
coupla hundred taps with a minature ball peen hammer on the end of the
shaft. Set up the dual screwdrive ArchemedesTech and the sucker popped out,
just barely. I will use three hundred taps next time and expect even better
results.
