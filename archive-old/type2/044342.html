Subject: [T2] Westy water tank leak ('79)

I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area where
the pump motor screws in. Is there a type of glue that can be used to seal
this crack effectively?. If not, are there any replacement water tanks on
the market either original equipment, or otherwise?
