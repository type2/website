Subject: Unleaded heads indifferent fuel qualities

Dear List members,

I am currently doing an article for the Carsonline_dot_com / carsonline_dot_com.au
internet sites, in response to many questions received about head damages
presumably resulting from indifferent super and standard fuel
substitutes...such as LRP leaded replacement fuels.

If any one can help re additives that should be used, or pricing and hints
(and urls where info can be found on on head exchange (for unleaded Heads)
programs, could you please let me know.

Regards,

Bill Webb
Webmaster
CarsONline group of internet sites.
