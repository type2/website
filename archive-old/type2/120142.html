Subject: Re: [T2] Axle swaps for 70 bus?

On Sat, 10 Jan 2004, Ray Nemo, the Bus Captain wrote:

&gt; I'm looking at a 70 bus.  It's pretty nice but
&gt; I'm not big on the drum brakes.  The guy at the
&gt; shop has several late buses and mentioned that
&gt; he'd swap the front end out of a late bus to give
&gt; me discs.  He didn't specify whether it would be
&gt; the 71-72 style or 73+.  I think for the 73+
&gt; style the entire steering box and all would have
&gt; to be changed.  How difficult is would these
&gt; swaps be?  Are there options other than swapping
&gt; the entire front axle?   Just the hubs etc.

I have not done this but the swap should be possible.

Good news:

the bolt pattern on the '70 beam should match the later beam;

the steering box is not an issue as it is mounted to the bus frame and not
connected to the beam.

Things to consider:

you may have problems connecting the actuating rod for the brake
booster to the brake pedal;

you will need to plumb in a vacuum line to the rear end and a static line
to the front dogleg;

you will need to replace your intake manifold with one from a '71 bus with
the proper nipple;

you *may* need to find a '71-73 booster unit as they were a different and
smaller diameter than the later units;

you will definitely have to replumb the metal lines both to insert a
proportioning valve and to bring the ends to the new position of the
master cylinder;

you should consider substituting the later upper resevoir.

Bad news:

You are, alas, stuck with the earlier steering box as the mounting points
are different for the later box.

&gt; How about the rear end so that I'd have the same wheel bolt pattern.
&gt; What has to be changed?

Measure it up, but I believe you need only replace the early hub/drum
casting with the later separte hub and drum.  At worst I believe you will
need to replace the cylinder and shoes.  Again the warning that I have not
done this but have seen many of both the early and late bays.  I'd wanna
take a micrometer to them to be sure but they look very close.

                             OOK!
