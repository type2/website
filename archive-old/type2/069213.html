Subject: stalling 71 bus : fixed

        First I want to thank all you who gave me suggestions of what to
check...It turned out that a stud was missing from the intake manifold
and extra air was getting into the carburetor.  Even though we had worked
on the brake lights and fuses right before this happened, none of it had
anything to do with the missing stud.  It was just a weird coincidence of
time.
        Second, I want to apologize for sounding like a whiney, snotty
brat who has Daddy fix everything, in my previous letter. I was
frustrated and stressed out, I had just gotten home from driving in 5
o'clock traffic, with a bus that wasn't running well.  Those are my
excuses;I just want you to know, he helped me to fix it, but I am trying
as well as I can to learn to do some of this myself as well.  I help him
when he works on it, and I am taking an 
autotech class too. It's just been a hard day, but now it's all over and
my bus is back!                         Dallas :)
