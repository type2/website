Subject: Shower System

Someone mentioned rigging up a shower system in a van.   I'm interested in 
hearing more about that!

I just acquired my '78 Campmobile....it was my uncle's, who unfortunately 
died on Halloween.  My grandfather gave me the bus.  It has about 235,000 
miles and hasn't had ANY work done to it for about 150,000 of those miles!  
It had been sitting a year when I got it, and all I did was change the oil, 
replace the fuel filter, spark plugs, oil filter, and battery....the bus 
started up the first time!  I'm so happy to have it!  You'll probably all 
heave a collective &quot;groan&quot; at this, but an artist friend of mine is going to 
paint the bus so I can drive it in Houston's next Art Car parade!
