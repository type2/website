Subject: Re: [T2] TIN IS FUN

Michael,

I'm not sure that there is such a book as these were installed(usually) at 
the port of entry by mechanics who did almost nothing else.

Basically, you have a compressor with two hoses coming from the front 
ofthe bus.

The compressor is mounted to a metal &quot;frame&quot; which is then mounted onto
the fan shroud.  

You should be able to unbolt the compressor(4? bolts on the bottom) and 
then twist it enough to &quot;unhook&quot; it from the fan belt to get it off off 
the metal mount.  Carefull when it comes off at it is very heavy.

What happens next depends on whether it is a total uninstall(and destroy)
or you intend to keep it.

Fan belt goes to a pulley behind the fan inside the fan shroud.  You 
can just cut the belt and remove it without touching anything else if it 
is a remove and destroy mission.

You *will* need to fab up some body metal that was cut out, and replace 
some sheet metal tin if you are removing it forever.

More info if necesary...

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; to anyone who is doing this sort of work for the first time, the book &quot;how
&gt; to rebuild your aircooled VW engine&quot; by tom wilson, is indispensable. it
&gt; covers most aspects and models....
&gt; ____________________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; Does this book cover the Air Conditioning System?
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any links to info about the Air Conditioning Systems? I am 
&gt; about to remove my compressor and posssibly the rest. I just would like to 
&gt; see some pics or shop drawings, something to give me a more visual image of 
&gt; the components related to the engine, before I start.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
