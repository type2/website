&gt; Greetings to the List,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody here done any business with Z Products, a company based in
&gt; Wilsonville, Oregon?  They are a VW camper conversion company.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm interested in one of their products.  On their website
&gt; (http://www.zproducts_dot_com/vwvancamper.cfm?cid=771) they feature a Z-bed
&gt; conversion kit.  It allows your stock third seat to fold into a regular Z-bed
&gt; configuration.  While down as a seat it looks absolutely stock.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any experience with the company or their products?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
