&gt; &gt;Has anyone else run into this problem and found a way around it?  Any help

Actually the only larger tank outlets I have seen are on the aircooled
Vanagon with gas heater.  The '85 and the '88 tank I bought for it both
featured a outlet and inlet on return side for the normal 6? mm fuel
line.  However the '81 has this monster like 10-12 mm outlet then a T
for the gas heater and for the f.i. pump.  Which brings me to a
question, I know there exists a BIG, BIG bus style fuel filter, I can
find the normal little to big and the little to little, but I really
need a big to big to go in front of the T.  The PO put a teeny little
bug style plastic filter in the HIGH PRESSURE side of the system,
terrifying, I replaced it with a metal canned job, the best I could
find.  The problem is the hose from tank to T is massive, I'm about to
use one of those Purolator glass see through jobs as it is the only
thing I can find with 3/8&quot; fittings (about what it will take), but
they scare me as well and offer fairly poor filtration, might be fine
for a carbed vehicle not for this.  I know the Bosch big/big exists just
can't quite find it.  Anybody got an idea of a part number.
