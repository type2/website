Subject: RE: [T2] oil filter cross reference - FART

Blake said that &quot;the oil filter off of a Rabbit
would fit the threads and seal up well, and also is
longer and more narrow. &quot;

Yes, the FRAM PH2870A has the same threads and will match the rubber gasket 
(almost) exactly. It is the most common filter for the older VWs. checkout 
the FRAM site at www.fram_dot_com

Now, let's hear it from the technical gurus.
