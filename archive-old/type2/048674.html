&gt;I personally have no knowledge of the Quaiffe differential, but I should be 
&gt;able to find contact details for Autocavan, who sell them in Great Britain.

They do not make a 091 unit.  They make only a bug unit.  The GB
office referred me last year to their us affiliate to talk about getting one
done if we got enough interest, but it didn't seem worth the effort as those
guys have raised the prices of their FWD units from $450 to over $1200
since the late 80's as they are the sole US source.  New ZF's with 25%
slip (clutch pack style) are available from German sources for about
$1000.  That would be my choice if I had a damn 4 spd van to put it in.

There was some talk among the syncro types as well as to whether or
not the Quaiffe which is a &quot;torque biasing&quot; unit and very nice in FWD
autocross will actually &quot;lock&quot; under conditions of total loss of traction
of one wheel as offroader types would like.  I'm not sure about this.
