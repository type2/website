So far, we, the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club, have a very good relationship 
with three of the four local Volkswagen dealers.  Burnsville, West Side and 
Countryside all have taken turns sponsoring our spring swap meets.  The 
annual show is held at West Side and they usually let us move the new cars 
off of the lot for them.

Hopefully this does not change.

&gt; Around here (western Wisconsin and the Minneapolis-St.
&gt;  Paul areas of Minnesota), the VW dealers are helpful
&gt;  to the extent of offering their sales lots for VW car
&gt;  shows in the summer, and their inside shop space for a
&gt;  winter parts swap.  Without the dealers, the ACVW
&gt;  owners would be hard-pressed to find a good place to
&gt;  have these activities.  
&gt;  Maybe it won't happen this year??
