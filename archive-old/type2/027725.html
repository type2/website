Hi.  This is my first post.  I just got a 68 camperbus.  It has a &quot;new&quot; 1600 
that was built in a 1966? single-relief case (H0604044).  Upgrades beyond 
the bigger crank include GEX Dual Port heads, 30/31 carb, alternator, 
doghouse, temp sensor in relief valve &amp; VDO oil temp gauge in the clock 
hole, and a foam-type air filter (although I have the original oil-bath in a 
box).  Only 200+/- miles so far -- first oil change this weekend!  I have a 
few questions:

1. It runs right between 250 and 300 degrees after it warms up.  I have been 
told that 250 s/b the max temp for oil. It does come down below 250 in town 
sometimes.  Again, only a few miles so fsr, so no reall pattern established 
yet.  Comments?

2. The column cluster wiring is messed up some.  turn signals &amp; hazards 
don't flash and either switch lights both the left and right indicators 
steady-on on the dash and the bright filaments in the 1157 bulbs do not come 
on except witht he brake pedal.  The wipers only work when the fourway 
switch is on.  Fuses look good, and I cleaned the fuse seats.  Flashers?  
Bad insulation?  Common problems?

3. The brakes pull hard to the left and at least one is scraping, but can't 
tell which is the culprit, front, rear or both.  I have not pulled the drums 
off yet to see if any are turnable, but if they are not, what's the best 
source for new drums?  The parts house in town can't get them for 68-70.

Thanks!
