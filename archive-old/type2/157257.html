Subject: Re: [T2] heater box question - asbestos

Asbestos in the heat exchangers? Geez! Way back when I
first got my bus, a shop overhauled the engine and
hot-tanked the heat exchangers. For years after that,
little grey fibres would come out of the defroster
vents and collect all over the dashboard. That was
asbestos I was breathing? (from a '79) Does anyone
know for sure? -BaH (with a mess of respiratory probs
recent years!)

&gt; I was recently having lunch with an old friend who
&gt; had a bus a few years
&gt; ago.  He asked if I had my heater boxes replaced due
&gt; to asbestos.  He said
&gt; that about 5 years ago he received a notice about
&gt; asbestos and he contacted
&gt; whoever it was that sent the letter and they flew a
&gt; guy out to Sioux Falls,
&gt; trailered his bus, took it to a local dealership and
&gt; replaced the heater
&gt; boxes - all for no charge.
&gt; 
&gt; I was just wondering if anyone else experienced
&gt; something like this or
&gt; knows anything about this and if there is more
&gt; information available.
